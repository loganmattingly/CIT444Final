148,1749,"Oct 4 2006	Tiny and Pricey	The last time I was in a room this small I was on a cruise ship. It was clean, nicely decorated and they made good use of the space, but it was tight. My guess is it was no more than 150 square feet. We were on the top floor and had no view whatsoever. And the price tag was $300 a night. There have to be other places that offer a little more elbow room in that price range."
149,1749,"Sep 24 2006 	fab hotel in the heart of nyc!	Just returned from a week long stay in the Amsterdam Court Hotel in New York. This hotel should go under the category 'Boutique'! Right in the heart of the city, this hotel was such a nice place to stay. Rooms were small but well maintained and very clean. The bathroom (en suite) was a decent size though. Staff were very friendly and exceptionally helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveller on a middle budget.Claire, Dublin."
150,1749,"Sep 16 2006 	Great Location but Only Book If Cheap	I was in NY from September 2-7/06 and got a great rate through Expedia for $135Cdn/night. The first night my boyfriend and I arrived (approx. 1AM), the front desk male said there was a problem with our room. Basically, they gave it away because they were overbooked. I was very annoyed at this point since I had called the night before to confirm that it would be a very late check-in and to ensure that our room would be ready. The front desk person then said they would pay for our cab fare and settle us into their sister hotel 4 blocks away on 54th St. (Ameritania Hotel), and that we'd be able to check back into the Amsterdam the next afternoon. When we checked into the other hotel, boy, were we in for a big surprise. I realize space is at a premium in NY, and rooms are tiny, but we opened the door, and the door hit the bed. The washroom had no tub, just a tiny shower that was a nasty grey colour, and we basically had to sit sideways to use the toilet to prevent our knees from touching the wall (I'm only 5'2&quot;!!). We sucked it up since it was for only one night, and the next day, we went back to the Amsterdam. The lady at the front desk was very nice and said that since we were put through some trouble the night before, the hotel would upgrade us to a king-sized bed. We were ecstatic and very appreciative that they were trying to redeem themselves. When we got to the room, it was still tiny, like most hotel rooms in NY, but it had a very comfortable bed and pillows, was clean for a hotel room, and the washroom was spacious with a tub/shower combo. The water pressure was decent, and the air con worked. It can be a little noisy at night or in the morning because the walls are pretty thin, and the hallway is very narrow, so you are in close proximity to your neighbours. There are very few channels on the small TV, but you're not in NY to watch TV anyways. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you can get a cheap rate. It's a 3-star hotel supposedly, but maybe the standards are different in NY since most hotels there are pretty old. If you want a bigger room with more frills, you would have to pay way more and find at least a 4-5 star. Would suggest the SuperShuttle to/from the airport because it's only $17/person as opposed to $45+tolls+tips for cabfare. But only use the shuttle if you are not in a rush to get to/from the airport because it makes several stops at different hotels to pick other passengers up. It's a van, not a bus, so not too many passengers (up to 9, I believe).For Broadway show tickets, go to a TKTS booth and purchase them there. You can get tickets for 50% off for most shows. Recommend the play &quot;Avenue Q&quot; if you like fun, humour, and good music.For good, cheap bbq food, go to Dallas BBQ. Huge portions for what you pay for!! Go to Chinatown for cheap, authentic fare."
151,1749,"Sep 3 2006 	Great location lovely small rooms	Having stayed in NYC 3 times previous, I wasn't expecting much from this hotel. When we arrived, I was pleasantly suprised for a few reasons:1. Location - pretty much right in Times Square, on 50th &amp; Broadway. This is a great central base, right next to the subway with lovely restaurants all along 8th Ave on the left side of the hotel2. Rooms - very clean, very modern. They are small, but this is NYC after all. You're not going to spend much time in the room anyhow! The bathroom is also small nicely set out, with the BEST toiletries I've ever gotten in a hotel.3. Free cappuccinos - not a bad addition - plus the internet was pretty cheap with is unusual in a hotelThe staff were varied - on the first night, the concierge was amazingly helpful, very friendly and really made a good first impression. My friends weren't so lucky, we had paid extra for them to have a twin room and there wasn't one available. The hotel supplied them a foldaway bed FOC. The problem was on the second night when there was a room available, the staff (a different group from the previous night) caused us a lot of grief and were really obnoxious. They wanted to charge us extra for the twin room and didn't give a damn that we had already paid extra through the website we'd book with. Then when the manager finally approved the room without their additional charge, they acted like they were doing us a favour. My friends had paid a substantial amount more for this in the first place!!! Anyhow, that group of staff aside (2 younger girls), everyone else was pleasant.The elevators are a little older and the staircase is a bit dated, but that's the charm of NYC. I've stayed in the Holiday Inn previously and would highly recommend this place in comparison.It's not the cheapest place around, but it is competitive for the location. Highly recommended."
152,1749,"Sep 2 2006 	Great Place in Midtown	Found a gem in midtown. Amsterdam Court was quite a value--convenient, clean, quiet and comfortable. The room I stayed in had a double bed, chair, desk and bathroom. It was more modern than the other NYC hotels I've stayed in. Lobby is small--not for sitting and relaxing, but they have a nice coffee room. Would definietly stay there again. One tip--use the &quot;2nd elevator&quot; as it is faster than the main one."
153,1749,"Aug 16 2006 	Overpriced for an Average hotel.	Okay, I understand that staying within downtown NY is expensive...but this hotel was WAY too expensive given the accomodations were average/below average. HOWEVER, customer service is TOP NOTCH. The room seemed as big as a cubicle, and my husband and I had issues with the plumbing. We almost burned ourselves with extremely hot water...in the shower, the water coming out of the spout luke warm, but when you switched it to the shower head setting...it was scalding hot. BEWARE if you have small kids. And, in terms of cable television...channels were limited. I don't know if fuzzy pictures can actually claim having cable television. Overall, it was a place to stay to sleep so I give it an OKAY review. By the way, hotel is extremely CLEAN! My husband and I are about clean places and this place gets two thumbs up for that, in addition to their customer service (also important factor)."
154,1749,"Aug 10 2006 	Ode to a Hotel	My partner, (and I), along with our two best best friends stayed at the Amesterdam Court Hotel for 6 days (July 31 - August 6). Here's what you need to know - (Based on my experience) 1. The rooms are SMALL. These are not family friendly rooms, if you are planning to bring kids, be prepared to deal will a rollout bed in a small room, I guarantee, you will lose your mind. 2. You cannot beat the location if you are doing a theater trip, it's pretty fabulous and near the subways if you want to do some sight seeing, I repeat, you cannot beat the location. 3. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel room, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL, these rooms are for sleeping only and really, If you are visiting New York, why would you need to spend time in your room? 4. If you are high maintenance (and you know who you are) DO NOT CHOOSE THIS HOTEL. The Amsterdam Court id growing and there are some things that need to be worked out, but the staff was helpful and friendly, there was plenty of hot water for showers and the rooms were clean. 5. Problems I encountered - There were a couple of days that the phone didn't work, there were no windows in our room (Which made you think that it was ALWAYS dark), and our particular room (223) has a big gap under ther door, which makes for you being able to hear all the noise in the hallway. But in all honesty, I would stay there again., because all I need to do in NY is sleep! I do recommend this hotel, just not for families."
155,1749,"Aug 2 2006 	Very disappointed... :-(	When we arrived at the hotel the lobby was very warm but we could feel the AC kicking in and cooling off. We had no problem checking in, but as we made our way to the 6th floor you could feel how warm it was. We heard our window AC unit before we even got to the room. When we opened the door it just barely cleared the bed. The room was very small, but since it had a king size bed in it we felt that maybe it was because of the bed. In order to walk around in the room one person had to sit on the bed or stand in the bathroom so that the other could get by. We knew the power had been off seeing as how the clock radio was flashing, but all seemed to be working at that point, except for the phone. When we went downstairs later we were told that they were having problems with the phones. The AC was so noisy that we had to turn the TV up to almost the highest level, and then we still couldn't hear half of what was going on. We specifically went to NYC to go see a show which started at 7:30. About 5:00 the power went off. We decided to get our things gathered in case the power was still off when we came back and they had to relocate us. In the 30 min it took us to get ready for our show and pack our bags it was pretty stiffling. I unplugged the tv because we weren't sure the remote had turned it off, and left for our show. We returned to the hotel about 10:30 and was told the power was back on. The AC was running, and we plugged the TV back in, only to see sparks come out of the wall plug! We settled in for the night, watched a little TV and then turned everything off to try and get some sleep. We made the comment that the sooner we fell asleep the sooner it would be morning and we could get out of that place! The AC unit made it very difficult to sleep, and we tried turning it to a lower setting, but then the room would get too stuffy. Before we could even go to sleep the power went out again. We had to open our door in order to see to find our clothes; the hallway did have emergency lighting. We gathered our things and made our way down 6 flights of stairs, all fully lit. Some people were taking the elevators we were too chicken to attempt it, so we stuck to the stairs. The night manager gave us a full refund when we demanded it. We left about midnight, and will never return to this hotel."
156,1749,"Jul 18 2006	Great price great location	My fiancee and I visited NYC from 7/13/06-7/16/06 and we were taking a chance with a fairly unknown hotel in NYC. When we located our hotel, much to our surprise, it was a short walk to Times Square without being in the crowds. The location was great. There was a subway not too far from us that went downtown and the subway going uptown was only a short walk away, as well. The room was fairly small, but who goes to NYC to sleep? The bed was also nice and comfortable. The bathroom was exceptionally clean and fairly large. I would definitely go to Amsterdam Court Hotel again, especially for the price we booked it for!"
157,1749,"Jul 4 2006	Great Price and Location	My partner and I stayed at the Amsterdam Court Hotel for 3 nights at the end of June. First off the front desk staff were friendlly and efficent. We were on the 7th floor and omg our room was small, but hey, it's Manhattan who cares. The room was decently decorated with a comfortable bed and a really nice bathroom. I found it to be very clean, safe and comfortable. Air conditioning wasn't that great and the elevator was a little slow but we paid $150 cdn on Expedia. If we were staying at say the Waldorf or The W I am sure I could find a lot to complain about this hotel is definately worth the money in my opinion. You are a half block off Times Square, right across the street from the Gershwin Theatre (where Wicked is playing) everything you need is right there. I am going back in August and I will be staying at the Amsterdam Court Hotel again."
158,1749,"Jun 27 2006	Portrait of a Dump	We booked four nights at the Amsterdam Court Hotel on Hotel[-], arriving on a Thursday and leaving on a Monday. Although I called to confirm the reservation and was assured a king or queen, when we arrived about 11:30 PM on Thursday the only room left had two double beds. That would have been OK, except the window air conditioner made as much noise as a gas lawnmower and the beds were worn out and soft. Given it was hot and humid in NY we had to use the airconditioner, but slept very little. We were not able to move the second night because the clerk did not give us the correct instructions for changing rooms, although we requested to be moved Thursday night. The third night we we moved to a room with a king, but again the window airconditioner was loud and this time so loud and grinding that it was not at all useable. So they moved us to a room with two soft worn out double beds and another loud airconditioner. In this room, the circuit breaker blew in the evening before we returned to our room, turning off the airconditioner and lights. We waited for some time to get it back on. Electrical overload can cause fires. On the fourth night they moved us to a &quot;luxury&quot; suite, not usually given to Hotel[-] customers. This room was OK, however the bathroom had not been cleaned well leaving dark hairs on the shower walls and in the tub. The capucinno machine worked one day out of four. The staff person said, &quot;It's always broken.&quot; There are no coffee machines in the rooms, and the coffee available downstairs was burned and not drinkable. Absolutely no security was visible. Well, atl least there were no rats in the stairway. The staff kept apologizing, but nothing changed. One of the elevators was out of service off and on. The computer did not work when we wanted to check out and we had to wait. Take my advice, go somewhere else."
159,1749,"Jun 27 2006	Perfect!	We booked 4 days at the Amsterdam Court in mid June. Having never been to Manhattan before, we hoped to chose the right hotel. Based on reviews from Tripadvisor, we chose the Amsterdam. Compact hotel, with small comfortable rooms, and clean.However, we had no idea how central the location was! Easy walks to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller, Theatres, restaurants, etc. And minutes to several subway stops.You can get anywhere from here! Less expensive than large, fancy hotels, and so convenient, don't overlook the Amsterdam Court!"
160,1749,"Jun 21 2006	Location and price	We spent 6 nights at the Ansterdam Court - 6/14 - 6/20. Having been to NYC before and staying in other hotels, we knew the rooms would be small. This was the best location of any other NYC hotel we have used in NYC. The beds, linens and bathrooms were great. This is basically what we need from a room in NYC - good sleep and a clean shower. If you are coming here to stay in a luxurious room, prepare to spend a lot of money. If you would rather spend your money on theater, great restaurants and all the wonderful things to do in NYC, then this is the place for you. I am a smoker and used the courtyard in the back of the hotel. This provided a great opportunity to visit with tourists from other countries and enjoyed some wonderful conversations about politics and other interesting topics. NYC Tips - If it is your first visit, the Gray Line tours are a great way to figure out what neighborhoods you want to spend more time in. Use the hop on hop off feature - buses really do come by every 15 minutes.Empire State Building - Know that it may take 2 hours to get through the lines to finally get to the top, especially on the weekendTKTS Booth - Great way to get 1/2 price theater tickets, now at the Marriot MarquisPlaybill website - great info on shows and ticket discount offersDon't try to do everything - Target the &quot;must sees&quot; that are on your list Good shoes - forget fashion, if your feet hurt it is hard to enjoy anything"
161,1749,"Jun 14 2006	Excellent value for money	Just returned from 4 night stay. No complaints at all. Room small but clean and tidy with en suite facilitiy. Daily maid service. All staff very friendly and helpful. Room was nice and quiet, apart from the new york traffic which comes with the territory. There are no restaurant facilities in the hotel, but continuous tea and coffee is available in ground floor lounge and there are plenty of eating places just a few steps away. Excellent location just off Times Square. This is a basic no frills hotel for visitors who just want somewhere to sleep. Would definately stay there again."
162,1749,"May 31 2006	The smallest bedroom in New York	Just back from New York and the room must be one of the smallest bedrooms in the world. It was clean and the bedlinen good quality, towels changed every day. The air conditioning was not the best, you only felt the cold air if you were standing up to 3 feet away, after that, the room was boiling, the temperature in New York for our stay was into the high 80's and you need your bedroom to be cooler than that. Our room overlooked the back of the building with the fire escapes so we could never tell what the weather was like until we left the building. Staff on the whole were efficient but not on a 'happy' sort of way. No dining facilities, although it states on the hotel blurb that they have dining, (dining room was being renovated and no date as to when this would be finished). If you want a room within walking distance of the theatres and Times Square, then this hotel is for you. But going all that way, it would be nice to have some space to put your case away (and not have it on the floor beside your bed) and to see the nightlife from your hotel window and not the fire escape across the way."
163,1749,"May 31 2006	Great location - fine hotel	My wife and I stayed in the Amsterdam Court for 4 days in May.The location of the hotel could not be better - 5 minutes from Central Park and Times Square.On first appearance, the hotel seemed dark. Low level lighting was used throughout the hotel, a bit of a shock when we walked in from the bright sunshine.The room was very small, not much room for anything except the bed and two side lockers. However, I understand that a lot of New York hotel rooms are small. Also, we found it clean; sheets, pillows etc were all fine and bed was very comfy.The bathroom was also very clean and the shower had plenty of hot water.Overall the hotel was fine for our needs and cheaper than many other hotels in this area. I believe there are larger rooms available and if I was heading back I would take one of these."
164,1749,"May 22 2006	Serious problems	We just returned from a weekend at the Amsterdam Court Hotel in NYC. This hotel is less than desireable to say the least. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful upon check in, however it went downhill from there. The room we were given had a broken toilet. We only found this out upon flushing. It was totally disgusting as a bunch of #2 came up in our toilet. It wasn't ours. We went down to the front desk to let them know it needed fixing. We were leaving for a play and dinner and could not wait around to ensure it got fixed. When we got back after midnight, 6 hours later, it still wasn't fixed and the room smelled something awful. We went downstairs and raised hell with the front desk clerk. He tried to put us in a smaller room where the only thing that fit in the room was the Queen bed. We demanded another room with a King bed. We were finally given one after much discussion and arguing. At least in the new room, we couldn't hear the music from the bar downstairs. We weren't offered any help to relocate after having already unpacked all our suitcases.To make things even worse, on the second night, we were laying in bed when we heard rustling in a grocery bag we had sitting on the floor. When we turned on the light, we saw a mouse scattering under the bed. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep that night either. To be fair, the hotel's location is amazing. Right in the heart of the city. Walking distance to almost everything. And it appeared to be clean minus the rodent. The bar downstairs has great martini's during happy hour."
165,1749,"May 13 2006	It was ok but not great!	This hotel was ok. I was worried about it after reading some of the reviews. But, I never felt unsafe, and the room was clean. Lots of pillows on the beds, the beds were very comfortable, and it served our needs. However, it is not fancy in any way, so if that is what you are after, you will be disappointed! The rooms are very small. We had a deluxe room, with 2 beds. The beds take up literally all the space in the room. There was about a foot of space between the end of the bed and the window. We did not have any place to leave our luggage out. Only 2 small drawers to put clothing into, so we just left everything in our luggage. I checked several websites for pictures prior to booking this hotel. The ones offering a virtual tour made the rooms seem larger and much brighter. The lighting was dim in this hotel, both in the lobby and in the rooms. The furnishings are ok, the style was not my taste, but the furnishings were in decent shape. The bathroom was clean, and there was plenty of hot water for showers each morning. The housekeeping staff would leave plenty of clean towels and soaps every day. Having a window that would open was nice, but the fire escape outside needed cleaning very badly. See the pictures I am posting with this review. We felt the air conditioning did not cool the room off very well. It was quite warm in NYC during our stay. All in all, not a bad experience, but I would probably choose another hotel on my next stay, just to have more room. The location of this hotel can't be beat. Just minutes from Times Square, with a subway station just a couple of doors down. The only noise we heard was from the water pipes when someone would take a shower, but it wasn't too bad. Some sites mentioned a free continental breakfast and safes in the room. We had neither. We locked valuables in our suitcases while gone during the day. There was a nice deli around the corner, the Belly Deli, and a drug store that we stopped into several times. Just want to give anyone thinking of this hotel an honest report. If it's in your price range and you just want the basics, it's fine. If you can afford more and want a little nicer room, stay elsewhere!"
166,1749,"Apr 16 2006	I love New York	First time to NYC and loved it! Things stay open longer that London. 24hr subway is great! Hotel was in a great location, just round the corner from Time Sq. Subway stations are everywhere (and one near enough next door to hotel. There is a good pub that does food up to 1am just down the road from the hotel. Sorry, can't remember the name of it but turn right out of hotel (on same side) and its just before you get to the junction. Only thing wrong with this hotel is that as well as the room being very small, it didn't let any natural light in. Getting up in the morning was like getting up in the middle of the night as the lights in the room were dim too (part of the design). The room had a window but it was on the side of the hotel which got no light. Rooms at the front may have been better but having asked about them, they ae superior rooms that were 50USD extra a night. Despite this, rooms very nicely designed and clean, although bathroom slightly dated looking and not as nice at the bedroom.Would stay here again but will prob splash out on a 'superior room' for more light!"
167,1749,"Apr 15 2006	Clean hotel great location	I just stayed at the Amsterdam Court for 3 nights. Overall, a good hotel with a great location in the Theater District. The rooms are small, yes, but it's NYC--that's pretty standard. The room was clean, which was great, and the staff was helpful. I got a great rate at hotels.com (&lt;$180/night). In almost any other city, the small room size and lack of cable TV would not earn an &quot;above average&quot; rating, but for NYC, the concerns should be cleanliness, location, and price, which this hotel had. I would stay there again!"
168,1749,"Apr 10 2006 	Clean Cozy and Just Right!!!	My co-worker and I stayed at the Amsterdam Court for 3 night because we were in new york for training. The hotel is conveniently located by several subway stations so we didn't have to meet the rush of Times Square traffic. The room was very clean and we each had our own full size bed with a cozy down comforter. It was also very nice that hotel had complementary hot tea, coffee, espresso and capuccino for the hotel guest at all hours which made the 30 degrees and rainy a little bit warmer. The staffs were polite and helpful. Since we had extra town to run around the city, they stored our luggage without charge after checkout so we didn't have to lug the luggages around while shopping."
169,1749,Mar 31 2006	Spot on 	Five of us stayed at this hotel and we all had a fantastic time. The Hotel is very clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is a stones throw away from times square and in a ideal location and although the rooms are not big who cares you only sleep in them and the beds are really compfy so you get a really good nights sleep. It was my first visit to New York and i cant wait to go back and would have no reservations about stopping here again and recommending it to family and friends so get booked and have a FANTASTIC TIME.
170,1749,Mar 26 2006	Great Choice for travellers on a budget!	My teen age daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. While planning our trip we decided to save $$$ on our hotel and splurge on Broadway shows. It was a great decision. The rooms were clean and pleasant (albeit small) as pictured on their web site. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location couldn't be beaten - just a few blocks from Times Square and smack in the middle of the theatre district. For dinner we would walk a few blocks and enjoy one of the numerous good ethnic restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. Free Expresso bar was a nice touch that we enjoyed daily. If you plan on spending a lot of time in your hotel room and want 5 star amenities - then you should stay at a 5 star hotel (and pay for it) - otherwise this is a great choice.
171,1749,"Mar 23 2006 	Excellent hotel for the price -- great value	The bottom line: I have stayed in a few dumps in NYC, and this hotel is NOT a dump. Yes, the rooms are very small like in most New York hotels. The renovations a few years ago were kind of slapdash in some ways with too much caulking around the sinks, etc. But to be fair, this is not a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel costing $350/night. It's a budget hotel in an old building. The lobby area has a lively bar and a nice little lounge with free coffee and tea and an internet terminal (charge applies). During my two visits (Sept. 2005 and March 2006) I have found the front desk staff to be professional and polite. Speaking of which, I traveled this time with a colleague who was given a ground-floor room. She heard a lot of noise from the lobby and from the smoking terrace behind the hotel, so I would avoid a ground-floor room.The furniture and bed linens look just like the photos on the hotel's website. The beds are very comfy and clean. I stayed once in a room facing 50th St. and once in the back of the hotel. I slept like a baby in the back room, though I got a lot of street noise in the front room (mostly drowned out by running the window a/c unit). The neighborhood is safe. There are delis and a subway stop just footsteps away, and you can walk to the heart of Times Square in about 2 minutes. I had a rental car for my business trip and paid $35/night to park across the street at a theatre's underground garage. Shocking? Yes, but that's the going rate for garage parking in midtown Manhattan.If you're traveling with kids, just be aware that there is an &quot;adult novelty&quot; shop on the same block. Frankly that is part of the history of the Times Square area, a holdover from the old seedy days before Disney came to the neighborhood. But the store is fairly low-key and you can't see much from the sidewalk. Overall this is a pleasant place to stay. I not only recommend it -- I was happy to return six months after my first stay. The Amsterdam Court ain't the Pierre or the Waldorf-Astoria, but it costs a fraction of what those hotels cost."
172,1749,"Mar 23 2006	Location location location	Reading previous reviews for this hotel did make us wary before our trip. However, as a previous reviewer quite rightly said, it is all about setting expectations. We were first time tourists to New York and so location and price were our prime concern. You'd do extremely well to get a better location for the price we paid. The hotel is just a stone's throw from Times Square, the main centre for tourists and Broadway theatre goers. There are plenty of subway stops, there is a 24 hour convenience store on the corner of the block and the Gray Line tourist buses leave from around the corner.The best thing about the hotel (other than its location) was its cleanliness - a major plus point. The room was a decent size, it did have a view of a brick wall, but we didn't care as we were out all day and being away from the street it also meant the room was quiet. The only notable negative was having to sit side saddle on the toilet due to its proximity to a wall, but I don't remember this spoiling my holiday! Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but they seemed alright. The lifts were incredibly slow and like another reviewer you call both lifts and see which one arrives first!Like most hotels in USA, there was no restaurant, but there are plenty of breakfast diners in the area (and eating out is a better way of getting a feel of the real New York).At the end of the day if you want a 5 star hotel, then book a 5 star hotel. If you are like us, i.e. tourists wanting a pretty decent budget hotel, then it is worth considering."
173,1749,"Mar 23 2006 	Wonderful	The best staff in NYC, they truly care about the service and helping everyone with there needs. The Hotel is clean and the location is fantastic!!"
174,1749,"Mar 20 2006	Don't know what they're complaining about	I was another leary person about booking this hotel because of the bad reviews. My friends and I had absolutely no problem and really liked where we were. We had 3 people in the room (booked from expedia) and I had requested a rollaway bed which came as soon as we got to the room. The room was unexpectedly large; more than ample for 3 people. I've been to New York before and was very prepared for a small room &amp; was pleasantly surprised. Small rooms don't bother me because I know what to expect from New York &amp; Europe, for that matter. The beds were very comfortable. The room faced the street so you could hear the noise, but we would come back so tired that it didn't matter. It was more like white noise to us; almost like listening to the soundtrack of New York. The staff was nice to us. We're a pretty self-sufficient bunch, so we didn't need any help with the city. When we interacted with the staff, they were wonderful to us. The great thing is the location to so many subway lines -- most within a block of the hotel. Plus you are very, very close to a lot of touristy stuff if you're there for the first time or there just to do the touristy stuff. I really liked that they had coffee &amp; espresso drinks for free all the time. There was not a lot of television station selection &amp; there was only radiant heat (hard to control, but worked well), but other than that, it was a great place &amp; very economical for the area. We were on the top floor &amp; didn't hear anyone else in the hallways or other rooms."
175,1749,"Mar 19 2006	Awful service	We (couple + 4-year old kid)stayed in the Hotel for three nights and found it OK, but with a really bad service.We had requested a roll-away bed for our kid, and were given the smallest room of the floor. The room was freezing, and the small heater in the room just could not cope with the cold air getting in from drafty windows. I complained with the receptionist, and first I was told that as it was cold outside the heating could just not cope and we had to live with it. I requested an additional heater (I saw somebody else getting one from the receptionist). The second evening, the temperature got even colder, and we still did not have a heater. After complaining again, I got some blankets but still no heater that somebody was supposed to teke to the room later.In the end, we never got the heater and nobody ever apologized for the inconvinience.Don't go there if it's too cold!"
176,1749,"Mar 8 2006 	Small Rooms the door hits the bed when entering	Okay, I will try to keep this review neutral. The location of the hotel is 3 blocks from Time Square and 6 blocks from NBC Studios. Location wise this hotel is good. However, the service in the hotel is terrible. I checked in and the hotel could not find my reservation according to the front desk lady they had lost my reservation. I showed the women my confirmation and the type of room I reserved. After a 15 minute ordeal regarding my reservation I was given a room that was so called &quot;deluxe.&quot; My colleague and I entered the room but the door hits the bed so we had to push the door forward with force so that the door could open than half way. My friend had to maneuver around me and my luggage so that we can both get in to the room. At the bed of the bed there is a narrow closet door which leads into a nice bathroom, however, the door also hits the bed as well. The room is the size of a large fitting room in a mid-scale department store. The worst part of the stay, I called in for a shuttle pick up at 4:30AM and left detailed information for the shuttle reservation. The shuttle arrived 15mins early and the driver asked the man at the front desk if he could call up to my room, the Front Desk man stated that the hotel does not call the rooms this early because the guest might get mad and it was protocol. The man at the hotel tells the shuttle to leave. I show up 2 minutes later and the front desk tells me he sent the shuttle away because he did not know what to do that early in the morning? My guess is to call up to my room if a shuttle to the airport shows up with detailed information regarding the hotel name, my name, and room number. Ugh!"
177,1749,"Mar 1 2006	Small Rooms but Great Location	The best thing about the hotel is definitely the location - only a 5 minute walk from Times Square and 1 minute from the nearest subway (this takes you downtown to the Financial District and is ideal for catching the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island).Our room was small and we had no view at all - in fact we couldn't even see the sky! we were about a foot away from a brick wall!! It was clean and comfortable though and the bathroom was ok (didn't feel too claustrophobic). Only downside was hearing next door take a shower (was actually quite loud)!We would recommend the hotel for the location - very handy for Times Square, and not too far to walk to the Rockefeller Centre, MoMA and 5th Avenue. There are also some really nice restaurants nearby - perfect when it's -10C (plus wind chill!) outside."
178,1749,"Feb 25 2006	Fantastic!!	This was our third trip to NYC.We had never stayed here before and were a bit apprehensive after reading some feed back left by previous travellers. We were really impressed by the standard of room and cleanliness and the staff were so helpful and if we contacted them we had an immediate response. We also got married during our stay and the hotel decorated our room upon reqwuest by my witness. Overall a fantastic trip and we would not hesitate to stay there again. I know some people have written that the rooms are small but hey, you're in New York! you have a bath and a shower and heating. One day it was -13 but the rooms were warm.No complaints."
179,1749,Feb 7 2006	location location location	Small room (we've had larger on a cruise ship...) but the service and location are great - literally right off Times Square. Price was fair for the location. Staff was very accommodating and courteous.
180,1749,"Jan 24 2006 	Overbooked inconsistant rooms.	The overall hotel experience was bad. I had specifically asked for a non-smoking room when I booked and let them know that I would be checking in late. Upon arrival, they put me in a fairly nice room that they said was a dual purpose smoking/non-smoking room. Unfortunately, the room and the entire floor smelled like fresh and old smoke. They ended up giving me a lower quality room (at the same rate) on the 1st floor near the lobby. The air conditioner/fan unit did not work (I tried to use it to block out the noise from the lobby and the toilet), the hot water nob in the shower sprayed out piping hot water (making it near impossible to use the handle without getting sprayed), the toilet ran all night and the noise from the lobby was equal to staying in a room above a bar, with dance music playing until 1:00 am. Overall, a very sleepless, unpleasant, experience. When I told the manager about the issues, she stated that I shouldn't need to use the air unit because it was January and that if I wanted a nice room that met my reservation 'request,' I should call them the day before my reservation, and double-confirm with them that my reservation was in place. But even then, she says that while there is a 1 day charge for canceling if they cannot meet the reservation, and there are no guarentees that this hotel can meet the reservation. On the up side. The employees were nice, and tried to be helpful under the circumstances."
181,1749,"Jan 12 2006	Cheap chearful and perfectly located	My wife and I have stayed at this hotel a number of times now. This is a great midtown location. The rooms are small, but clean and well looked after. You basically get what you pay for. If coming to NYC on a budget, this is a great place to stay. The subway is a few steps away as well. The bar was improved over a year ago and really is a nice place to start your evening off. As for breakfast...never tried it here...why bother? With so many choices of eating within minutes of walking. Another benefit...if you go here regularly, the doormen of the Gershwin apartments tend to recognise you and help you with your bags. god I love New York! (...and yes, staying here again this month!)"
182,1749,"Jan 4 2006	GO GO GO	well after seeing reviews on this site I was a little aprehensive...i got there for 4 nights, and was wel impressed!!!* excellent location, your corner shop is TIMES SQUARE* friendly reception staff* Trendy and Modern Hotel* Excellent VFM* Clean towels every day* Beds made evey day* FREE COFFEEwhat else is there to say???

183,1749,"Dec 22 2005	Perfect for our requirements	My husband and I stayed for 12 nights in October, as part of our honeymoon. I booked the room through a travel agent and requested an upgrade on check in. This was granted and we stayed in a very, very large, extremely clean and very comfortable room. My only complaint was the lack of a fridge (available at the rate of $25 per stay) and coffee making facilities in the room. Staff were always accommodating. Housekeeping was excellent. Perfect position with easy walking distances to most places of interest. Subway stations on each corner of the block. No complaints at all."
184,1749,Dec 20 2005	a great base	Ok we got off to a bad start they had our booking made for the day we were supposed to check out but never mind 5 minutes later and all was sorted.We were in room 526 at the back of the hotel so it was quieter and in New York quieter is good.The room was very clean and not a bad size it wasnt huge but still big enough for the 2 of us to spend 3 days in. there was a cupboard that was large enough for the 2 cases and plenty of hanging space. the desk had 2 draws of an ok size. Decor was very nice in muted browns and creams and it was clean. the bathroom was quite large but didnt have a vent so it steamed up very badly. The toiletries were nice too :)The location was first rate just further to the north of Times Square so a little less manic.Go to the roxi deli around the corner the food is great
185,1749,"Dec 15 2005	Good location nice staff small rooms	I have to confess that i was a little bit scared when i read all this comments specially about the staff,the room and the hotel itself!!! but when i got there on saturday morning, the staff was wonderful and very helpful, the rooms were so clean, and small but come on! it's new york!!! if you have traveled a lot, you won't be surprised.....it's the perfect place to sleep after a long day walking, and doing some sight seeing in this wonderful city!! if you just want a place to rest this is the perfect one, but if you want a huge place with all the amenities that you have in your house, it's better to stay home!!!... in a range of 1-10staff = 10, rooms=85, amenities=80, the entire hotel=80"
186,1749,"Dec 1 2005	Would stay again	We have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Amsterdam Court, but after reading some of the reviews on this site we were a little apprehensive about what to expect when we arrived at the hotel.The hotel is in a fantastic location - Broadway at the end of the street and Times Square a mere 2 minute walk away. Our bedroom and bathroom, although small, were spotlessly clean and nicely decorated. The one thing I would say is that the attitude of the hotel staff leaves a lot to be desired. I think it would have been nice, if not courteous to get a hello off the reception staff once in a while, but not once were we acknowledged when either leaving the hotel in the morning or coming back in the evening, and when we asked for directions to various places they were not helpful at all.All things considered, we would stay here again due to location of the hotel and the cleanliness of the rooms, and who cares if the staff don't acknowledge you - you're in NEW YORK!!!!!!"
187,1749,"Nov 21 2005 	Not good	To say this place is small is a massive understatement. The bathroom was so tiny there was only 4 inches of space between the toilet and the wall. If one were to want to sit on the toilet, you'd have to do so sideways. I took a picture of it with my phone, but have no idea how to upload it. There is a reason the rate is so cheap. It is hardly a diamond in the rough, although I will admit that the bed was quite comfortable as previous reviews have said. I can't comment on the staff as I had minimal contact with them. The views are of a brick wall. If this hotel was anywhere besides times square, it would be 44.95/night. All in all, it was basic shelter so dont expect anything more..."
188,1749,"Nov 15 2005	All about Location	Myself and three friends have just returned from a three night stay at the Amsterdam Court Hotel in New York. Having read past reviews on this hotel, i have to agree with people who have previously stayed here... the reception staff are incredibly unhelpful and rude to their clients. Having booked, five months ago, two TWIN rooms for three nights...we arrived to find that the hotel had mis-read the booking and booked us two double rooms. We were rudely advised that there were no other rooms for us to stay in, and so we had to share a double bed between two of us, in each room. This is ok, but having booked twin rooms, we were a tad unimpressed. The rooms are very small, and the views are hardly scenic!! The only positives about this hotel are the bellboys (scott and ben) who went out of their way to help us with all our bags and booking transport to JFK airport, and the location of the hotel to Times Square, Broadway and 5th Avenue. Given the location, it is very noisy at night...with no double glazing, it can be difficult gaining any sleep!! Tip - take ear plugs!"
189,1749,"Nov 4 2005	Awful in all ways	A colleague &amp; I traveled to New York City for business this summer stayed at the Amsterdam Court Hotel (226 W. 50th Street). The computer system was down when we checked in. Two days later when we checked out it was still down. Despite our requests, we were not given any documentation of our charges and were sent on our way by a curt receptionist saying we needed to use our credit card statements for business expense reports. Now in November, we are still fighting over hotel charges from this trip. In addition to charging me considerably more per night than we were originally quoted, they are alleging I stayed there a night longer than I actually did. The staff was rude and had attitude with us the entire time. A fax was sent from my office and after several trips to the front desk to get it, I was told it would be delivered to my room when it came in. It was delivered to the room a day late for the meeting I needed it for. The room I was in was so small the only place I could open the suitcase was on the bed. And while I am used to exorbitant NYC hotel prices, this one takes the cake. I will never go back and encourage all my friends and fellow travelers to stay away."
190,1749,"Nov 1 2005	Excellent Location Very Small Rooms	Me and my wife travelled here for 10 nights in September, great location rooms were very small but hotel was clean and room cleaned everyday. Have read some reviews about hotel think they are a little unfair as when you go to New York you are only using the rooom to sleep in if not then be prepared to fork out for a decent size room with this location also would like to say that is the best 10 days holiday me and the wife have spent so far in our lives.Graham - Scotland"
191,1749,"Nov 1 2005	Noisy but good location	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in March and despite a rather difficult first night there on the ground floor which was very very noisy, after being moved to the 5th floor it was fine. The room was average size for a budget hotel and the bathroom looked newly fitted and was clean. The staff were very accomodating in moving our luggage to the new room, and were all in all very helpful. The location was very good in that it was close to Times Square and all the tourist restaurants, however it didn't seem very safe at night as it was down a side street which seemed a bit out of the way. I'm sure thats what most of the city is like though! I can't really complain as we got a really cheap deal on this hotel but in the future I would stay somewhere a little more expensive just to guarantee the location and quality."
192,1749,"Oct 27 2005	Cannot complain	Cannot complain at all. Rooms, although small, were cosy, and spotlessly clean. We found the staff to be polite, especially Ben the Bellboy. They were helpful, we had an issue with the amount of beds in the room, and it was sorted within minutes. Extremely charming, and welcoming staff.Perfect location. A 2 minute walk from Times Square, but not on the main road, so not too noisy either. We will be returning to New York next May, and will be staying here again."
193,1749,"Oct 20 2005	Great hotel rude staff	We stayed at Amsterdam Court in October 2005.The location is excellent; 2 minutes from Times square and the big theatres.We were lucky to get the biggest room at the hotel, number 709. Remember that number - I believe the other rooms are much smaller.The room and bathroom was always good cleaned, new towels every day etc.The poor thing with the hotel is the reception staff. Rude, uniterested in the guests (dont expect a &quot;welcome&quot; when you arrive or &quot;hope ypuve enjoyed your stay&quot; when you leave. They wont/cant help ypu with anything.But if you dont mind them, and just want a good hotel at a good location for a good price - then you should try Amsterdam Court (room 709!!!)Beda"
194,1749,"Oct 11 2005	Laugh or You Will Cry	Well what can I say, after having read the other reviews on this website it has confirmed my suspicions that my friend and I are not actually going mad and that the staff at this hotel do rely on just calling all their guests liars, should any of them open their mouths. I was in NY with my friend who wrote the last review and as well as backing up her comments I would like to share my experiences of this hotel. When we arrived I was shocked at the way in which we were treated, having working in customer service roles I knew that the staff in this hotel should have been laying down a red carpet for my friend as they remembered the trouble she had earlier in the year, however they simply tried to tell her that we had no reservation for our first two nights, that she had not spoken to the specified member of staff about the gift certificate and simply used the old liar line. This is a ridiculous accusation considering the various phone numbers she had been given whilst contacting this member of staff. Due to the staff's inability to perform simple tasks we had two reservations for our 4 night stay. On our third evening whilst trying to get our card keys recharged (a worthwhile bit of advice - after going into shops they no longer work, helpful considering the amount of people that go to NY for SHOPPING trips) Elias chucked a reservation card at me and said we had not filled it out, I informed him that we filled one out when we arrived, he told me he had no information and we did not. I politely tried to tell him that we did, and I had seen all the paperwork for our stay the day before (we had a lot of this due to the gift certificate etc) he kept shouting at me we had no paperwork and we had had no other reservation, this went on for a little while until I (yes I had to suggest it, obviously his very clever English speaking brain could not think of this idea) told him to check on the computer who had been in our room for the two previous nights, ''oh you'' was his reply, yes I told him and that our reservation card and paper work was with the information for that reservation calmly walking off - unable to stand the rudeness of this man any longer - up the stairs to the 5th floor because as was the case for a lot of our stay the lift was not working. After this incident I chose not to speak to any of the staff about any issues, we only had one more problem after this which involved giving back the key to out stamp sized safety box  perhaps made so small so that anything of any value has to be left in the room for any member of staff to throw away  in this instance we asked the advice of Ben the bellboy, who cannot be faulted."
195,1749,"Oct 8 2005	Awful Hotel	Well, where do I begin with this 'hotel'. I have to agree with previous comments - apart from Ben the Bellman, the rest of the staff are the most useless and rude group of people I have ever encountered in my years of travelling. To cut a long story short, stayed here in April 2005 where after my third day I was shocked to arrive back at my hotel room to find the maid had thrown all of my travel documents in the bin - that's right, my flight tickets, my guide books (which can hardly be mistaken for rubbish!!), my marriage certificate...and it was not even sitting close to the bin. Personally, I think it was stolen as I found our bag of trash from our room for that day and it wasn't in there.Anyway, after a very traumatic time sorting this out, and a whole day wasted, I was given a voucher to stay at the hell hole again. I stayed for 4 nights this September, and this time was greeted by the 'Manager' refusing to accept my voucher!! After calling me a liar and having anargument with him on the phone, he begrudgingly accepted the voucher and then I spent the next 4 days having to put up with the stupid and rude staff. If you want a laugh, ask for help from Elias who is the so-called manager on duty for the night shift. He yelled at my friend and I for no apparent reason, kept screaming at us that he could speak English (very happy for you Elias, but to be honest I don't really care if speak Swahili!!). He was, out of an already bad bunch, the WORST. I do not have one single nice thing to say about this hotel, I would gladly pay a few extra quid for some good service and rooms bigger than my shoe cupboard. Do not stay here if you want to enjoy your holiday. Amsterdam Court hotel, bunch of cowboys in my opinion."
196,1749,"Sep 27 2005	Fleeced like a sardine	Besides paying too much for a closet-sized room, I called the morning before I checked in and inquired as to what the car storage fee would be. I was told that this was included in my room rate and parking would be FREE for my stay. So I actually drove into the city for a change. Only to find upon checkout that the garage they instructed me to used wanted $20 (discount rate for the Amsterdam). I returned to the counter to inquire why this was happening, and was assured that NO ONE at the Amsterdam Court Hotel could have possibly told me that there was FREE PARKING. I tried to get them to decide whether I was a liar or an idiot for 10 minutes and then left.No way to run a hotel - they made no attempt to fix the situation.Don't fall victim to these misrepresenting grifters. Better off to pay more and go somewhere else!!THColumbus, OH"

198,1749,"Sep 9 2005	Good value great location nice atmosphere	My friend and I stayed for 6 nights in June. We were a bit worried by some of the reviews, but got an excellent deal, so decided to go for it, which proved to be an excellent decision. It's true that some of the rooms were on the small side, but this is New York, and if you are on a budget, you have to be realistic.We wanted a twin room, and unfortunately non were available on the first night. Our first room wasn't great, and was very small, but had a lovely bathroom, and we were swiftly and smoothly moved to a twin for the remainder of our stay. This room was fab - very large, two double beds, decent wardrobe space, huge bathroom, aircon and very comfortable. The hotel is very smart and the decor is modern and attractive. I felt like I was staying somewhere much more expensive. The corridors are a bit more dowdy, and the lifts are slow and clanky, but it's not like you spend much time in them. Location, just off Times Square, is very touristy, but hey, we were tourists, plus it is within two blocks of 5 subway lines, so you can't do better for getting around the city - you could be at Battery City in 10 minutes if you were lucky.I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again, or recommend it to others"
199,1749,"Sep 7 2005	Location Location Location	Just spent a lovely night there while in NYC for the US Open. The location can't be beat. It's close to nightlife, food, theatre and transportation. The room I had was TINY (316)- as in the door barely cleared the bed and you couldn't have put more than 2 suitcases around the room at one time. But like they say, You aren't in NYC to stay in the room. The one &quot;real&quot; complaint was the TV. It would have been nice to return to the room between outings and catch things like CNN, MTV or even USA- USA had the US Open almost all day and nights. Room was clean, bed was comfy and bathroom was clean- could use an updated showerhead though. Older hotel but the staff I interacted with was pleasant and helpful and again, can't complain about the location."
200,1749,"Aug 24 2005	Well I liked it....	Prior to my trip I was somewhat concerned having read the mixed reviews on this site and it is clear that the hotel is one that divides opinions but I have to say I have just returned from a very pleasant stay of eight days at the hotel. Check in was smooth and professional even though I arrived early, the bedroom and bathroom were both clean and tidy, everything worked and teh bed was very comfortable. As to the size of the room, if mine was typical I really don't know what people have been complaining about (or where they have been staying in the past !) - for a 2 star, centrally-located hotel I thought there was more than adequate space (and as many have pointed out - you're in new York you shouldn't be spending a minute more than necessary in you room anyway !). Maid service was faultless - room was spotless when I returned each evening. Overall, given the price (for New York), the star-rating and teh superb location right at the heart of things and just 30 seconds from two subway lines, I can't fault it."
201,1749,"Aug 22 2005	Great Vacation!	I am always amazed when I read bad reviews and have had a totally different experience. As someone mentionned in an earlier review this is not a five star hotel, and to expect spacious rooms and five star service is unrealistic (It's like people who travel south and think the food will be just like we eat in Canada!). Yes, the hotel room was small, (but bigger than ones I've seen in Europe) and as someone else pointed out millions of people live and visit this city. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your hotel room this is not the place for you, however the only thing myself and two friends did in the room was sleep (and the beds were very comfortable), the rest of the time we were out exploring the city. (I recommend looking into the New York Pass before going, great deals). The staff was always friendly and helpful and the location was really great. My best advice to budget-minded travellers is lower your expectations, unless you're willing to spend lots of money. Research the city you're going to, expect that you may run into small problems, but in the end if you see the city (and NYC was awesome), you will have a sucessful trip. As for the Amsterdam Court Hotel, I feel that my friends and I got exactly what we paid for and our trip was one of the best I've ever gone on."
202,1749,"Aug 19 2005	Worst I have been in!	I checked in there on August 6, 2005. I thought it was quaint and the doorman was very helpful and pleasant. That is were it ended. The room was the size of a shoe box and we were promised a room with 2 double beds. It only had one. We were given a very uncomfortable cot. We were told to check at the front desk in the morning for a room with 2 double beds. I did this and was told very nastily by the front staff (REGINA) that they only had 16 rooms with double beds and they went to customers with 3-4 people. I asked why I wasn't told this prior to staying the first night and she just shrugged. The bathroom was terrible. I had to sit sideways on the toilet!! It was installed just a few inches from the wall. The room was dark and my view was of a brick wall. Every time the air conditioner went on, the lights dimmed. I was supposed to stay 6 nights but got the heck out of there the next morning. They didn't apologize or anything. Simply checked me out. VERY VERY RUDE! REGINA the front desk lady was nasty, cut me off while I was talking, and refused to help me in any way. They need to fire her. She was my last straw. I decided to leave after my conversation with her."
203,1749,"Aug 8 2005	Guest Beware	&quot;Guest&quot; Beware is an understatement for this hotel. Other than Ben the Bellman, the entire staff was rude and extremely unhelpful. We expected to have two rooms with two double each however we received two rooms with a single double bed. The staff said it really wasn't their problem that we did not have the rooms we expected that we should just take that up with Expedia. During our stay we heard this statement repeated several times to other guest &quot;not our problem - call expedia&quot;. We were informed that if a room with 2 beds was made available that we would be moved. However, when we checked back in the next day on the availability of anther room, we were informed that such a move was not possible. We were informed that rooms with 2 double beds are &quot;reserved&quot; for guest with 3 or more people in their party. The elevator is quite slow and often broken. Ice was available upon request however it took several request to receive any ice. The phone did not properly work - often there was no dial tone and the directions on how to utilize the phone were incorrect. The power went out several times during out stay - this blackout only occured in the hotel. The staff was not able nor were they interested in providing directions to local attractions. One desk clerk actually walked away when we asked directions to Ground Zero. The ONLY saving factor for this hotel is the location - right near Broadway/Times Square and a subway stop."
204,1749,"Aug 5 2005	This Hotel is quite a find!	This boutique hotel hasn't gotten the credit it deserves. I just returned from a 3 night stay, and it was great! Yes, the rooms are small, but plenty of space for 2 people, maybe 3. The bathrooms are large, nicely appointed and the toiletries are top notch. The staff was very nice and helpful with one exception, but there always is an exception. I wouldn't let her bad attitude change my opinion of this quaint, very clean, and lovely hotel! Plus, the beds are FABULOUS!"
205,1749,"Aug 4 2005	Fab location budget hotel	This hotel is fab for its location, you couldn't be closer to Times Square and not a far walk to Central Park. Very cheap for New York, desk staff were friendly, room was quite large. I have not given this an excellent rating because of the very small bathroom, with dated decor and a window that wouldn't close when it was snowing and freezing outside! The bedroom was very dark with no natural light, but nicely decorated. The plug in for electrical appliances was also very dodgy! Apart from these minor complaints I would stay here again as the location couldn't be better! And on a budget I don't think you could beat this hotel."
206,1749,"Aug 4 2005	Worst hotel every!	Our stay at the Amsterdam court was completely unsatisfactory! When we got back to the hotel we were told that we had one double bed and a cot. Which is not what we paid for, we paid for a triple room(2 double beds). We told them that it was not satisfactory and nothing at ALL for us was done for us. He told us that when you book through a third party that the hotel does not have control of which rooms they have reserved. We found this to be a big lie...Since we did not know what to do we took the room for the night...went to the room and it smelled like stale smoke and was the size of a shoe box. the cote was right beside the front door and infront of the closet. Which meant we could not hang up our clothes. Called the front desk and they gave us another room which was even smaller than the first. The cot went right infront of the door and the bathroom. Called down once more and talked to the manager and she told us she would put us in a king size bed and a cot. We get to the room and the bed was a double...it was the size of the first room minus the smoke. At this point I made a collect call to my travel agent and told her the story and she tried to help us as much as she could by talking to the supplier. Basically she said for the night we could not do anything. We were told to go and talk to the manager in the morning. We went out that night when we got back at around 1:00am we unfolded the cot and I sat at the end of it and I fell off because it was broken. We Called down at the front desk and someone came and took the cot, and gave us another one 45 minutes later. It was very uncomfortable the springs could be felt so the 3 of us sleep in a double bed!!!! with some of our body parts hanging off the bed in order not to crush each other. Saturday morning we went downstairs and asked for the manager and we were told that he worked last night. So we asked to be moved to there sister hotel. If we did not ask to be moved we would have been stuck for the whole weekend in that room!!!! The hotel did not even recommed this option to us.I will NEVER AGAIN stay at this hotel and would not recommend it!"
207,1749,"Jul 27 2005	Wonderful find - when can I go back!!	Having booked this hotel back in Feb BEFORE reading trip advisor i was a little nervous about what i would find all i can say is - WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE ON???!!! This is a beautiful boutique hotel that is an oasis of calm compared to the huge impersonal hotels you find in New York City. It is modern, the decor is beautiful and the new cocktail bar the Trousdale is fabulous. The bed rooms are small but it's a boutique hotel as i said and you have room to put away your clothes, iron your clothes if you want! It felt more like you where staying in someones house - which I happened to like but if you want a huge genetic hotel room that you've stayed in a hundred times before then this is not for you!The staff were helpful and as it's such a small hotel you sorta got to recognise everyone, the housekeeping was perfect and not rude as i have found in other bigger hotels.They seem to be getting a makeover at the moment but thankfully again they where discreat and you weren't woken up by the sound of bulders. The Coffee bar was great and had an internet hub if you wanted to pay and get on line. The locations was stunning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! opposite the Gershwin Theatre - which was handy for us as we had tickets for Wicked! Times Square well you couldn't get much closer for this price 3-5minute walk and you were at the tkts booth. I think this Hotel is perfect for young couples- well couples in general if you're a business man lets face it your company's probably paying so you could go somewhere bigger and better equipped for you needs! All I can say is it met my needs prefectly."
208,1749,"Jul 10 2005 	Do your dang homework people.	Here are some helpful hints to people coming to stay at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. As a New Yorker who was a bellman in the hotel industry when I was growing up, I can't believe some of the reviews I read on here. First of all, this is a two star budget hotel. If you want a great hotel experience in New York City, you have to pay top dollar. And when I say top dollar I mean at least $300 or $400 a night. And yes, the rooms are small. Do you realize you're in New York City where 22 million people live in the metro area? We don't have a lot of space here, so if you expect a big room with a lot of space, stay in New Jersey. And another thing, if you're going to buy from hotel scalpers (a.k.a. websites) understand that those cheap rates are cheap because there are risks involved. This particular hotel only has 16 rooms that have two beds in the room, so if you book through a website please understand that the bedding type is a request only, not a confirmed guarantee. That's one of the many reasons why its so cheap to book online, the risks. And those who complain about noise is just plain rediculous. You're in Times Square, NYC not at some far away in the country bed and breakfast. 22 million people kind of produce a lot of noise. Use common sense please.  There is no greater insult than not tipping cabbies, bartenders, or bellmen. I tip bellmen the standard $1 per bag. So if you have like 8 suitcases and you give the bellman a $1 bill, that is a massive insult. When you tip the bellman at a hotel, he will be more inclined to point out secrets about NYC, discount cards to great restaraunts, and cheap transport back to the airport. These guys have connections, so if you don't tip them you could wind up missing out on some great experiences. I hope this has helped some of you who plan to stay at this hotel. I've stayed here 3 times now and I've had no major complaints. It's a great hotel for the price and location, and most of these bad reviews are for people that pay 2-star rates and expect a 5-star hotel."
209,1749,"Jun 20 2005	Wouldn't go again	After reading the reviews before we went I still think we were expecting something a bit better than we got. We got there at 7am but couldn't check in until 12pm which after a long flight from Honolulu wasn't what we'd hoped for but we did manage to leave our cases there . The room itself was extremely small and although the decor was fairly new because it was so dark it made it seem even smaller. We also had to fit a crib into the room which had to be lifted across the bed and jammed between the wall and the bed as this was the only place it would fit and the stroller had to be parked in the bathroom. Also the bedding wasn't changed, the quilt was just turned over so it looked as though it had been. There was a mouse trap but we didnt see any mice. Most of the staff were nice and helpful. Location was excellent. Don't think we'd be stopping here again"
210,1749,May 21 2005	Awful service but good location	The location of this hotel is great. If you looking to stay directly in the Theater District then this is the place; however don't stay at Amsterdam Court if your looking for a friendly or helpful staff. The Front desk was not very friendly &amp; the bartenders were just plain rude! (and not in the &quot;the new yorker&quot; way) The rooms were tiny and the shower flooded. Overall I wouldn't stay here again for the rate. NY brings in people from all over the world; the staff should be more accommodating. Overall really disappointing.
211,1749,"May 10 2005	So close to Times Square	To be completly honest I went to this hotel not knowing what to expect after the reviews i have read, but to clear up any uncertainity, this hotel is fantastically positioned, 2 minutes walk from Time Square, and 2 blocks from 5th Ave, excellent location. As for the hotel, the rooms were clean, but very small, definatly too small to swing a cat, safe behind reception, hallways being decorated on the day we were leaving, reception does ask for a depostit, staff friendly. Had this trip with a 11 year old child, stayed here for Easter, the street where the hotel is, is very busy and to be honest can be noisey but when you are positioned so close to the heart of New York, what do you expect, this place is great to shop all day, eat out or party out at night and just come back and crash out until the next day. Or catch a bit of sightseeing. This is the place for you, and the money you save on cheap accomodation, you can just spend it on 5th Avunue!!! The bar down stairs is very trendy looking, and didnt disturb us and if my child hadnt been with me on this trip i might have very well tried it out!!! This place is a base, a place to sleep, def not The Hilton!! No complimentry breakfast and I think there was a flask of coffee for the guests!!! But you can always go to Starbucks! You get what you pay for, p.s there were no mice!!! Written by a down to earth london girl, all in all not a bad place."
212,1749,"May 6 2005	Great location great value	Just got back from spending 6 nights at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. Having read some of the reviews other travellers had posted about the hotel, we were a little anxious about what we might find. However, we were more than pleasantly surprised! The lobby and bar were attractive and stylish, and the staff helpful and pleasant. OK - so our double room was not huge, but it was plenty large enough for a couple, and had plenty of wardrobe space and drawers and also a desk. It was nicely (and fairly recently) decorated, and was really clean. The bathroom was again quite small, but well set out and seemed to have been fairly newly updated. The shower was powerful and hot. Our room was cleaned to a really high standard and replenished with clean towels every day. Overall, we were really pleased with both our room and the hotel in general. There is some decorating work being done in some of the hallways, but this did not pose any problems at all. The main advantage of this hotel is the location - it is perfect if you want to be in the thick of things! Times Square and Broadway are just around the corner, but you can (and we did!) walk to lots of other attractions from here including ESB, Central Park, MOMA, Natural History Museum, Guggenheim etc.I will definitely be recommending this hotel to others visiting NY - its is affordable, pleasant and ideally located.Hope this helps other travellers - enjoy your trip!"
213,1749,"Apr 25 2005	This place is a great three star hotel	I, too, had concerns after reading come of the reviews here, but this place is great. The staff was very friendly, curteous and accomodating. Based on the reviews, I asked upon check-in for one of the larger rooms, and that's what I got (although by the floorplan, it appeared there are even larger rooms available). Very nicely decorated and appointed, with four feet along the sides of the bed and easily 10-12 feet between the foot of the bed and the bathroom - which was spotless. My only concern would be that, on a hot day, the window air conditioner wouldn't be strong enough to cool the room.The bar was very nice - and again, very friendly - and the location cannot be beat. I would defintely stay here again and recommend it to friends."
214,1749,"Apr 22 2005	Can't believe the reviews on here	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel from 7th-12th of April 2005 and before we arrived I was very aprehensive about what it was going to be like after reading some of the bad reviews on here. However I can honestly say that we could not fault the hotel at all and we really enjoyed our stay here.Staff were all very friendly and helpful, especially in arranging our transfer to the airport for our flight home at a very reasonable price. The room although on the small side but there was plenty of space for the two of us and it was impecably tidied every day. Bathroom was also very clean and we had fresh towels every single day. Like I said the room was small but why would anyone go to New York and just stay in their hotel room the whole time? As for the location it could not have been better. Times Square and Broadway right on your doorstep, a subway right next door, and plenty of bars, restaurants and shops nearby.I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York as the hotel made our stay all the better and when I come back to New York I will be staying in this hotel again without hesitation. So if you have booked or planning on booking this hotel please don't be put off by the reviews of some people on here. Just expect a good 3star hotel, go there with your eyes open and you will have a great stay here."
215,1749,"Apr 19 2005	Better Than Expected!!!	We have just spent five nights in this hotel. We were expecting a twin roombut when we were shown to the room we found it only had one bed ( queens size ) went back down to reception to complain was informed it was the only room available until sunday which was our last night there. The room was small but clean, ample storage. Bathroom clean, plenty of hot water, but bath was very slippery, so watch out. Staff were very helpful and most were cheerful. Our window did not open onto a city street view instead we had a lovely view of the fire escape!!!Excellent location, had a great trip and would use hotel again."
216,1749,Apr 19 2005	Best location in the city!!	We wanted to put the record straight after reading the bad reviews on this page.My husband and I stayed here to celebrate my Birthday and had a great time.Yes the rooms are small but if you wanted something bigger in the same location then you would have to pay double the amount! You are right in the middle of all the sights - Times square on your doorstep and the fab shops of 5th avenue a 5 minute walk away.Despite the rooms being small they are spotlessly clean with tasteful furnishings and a very comfortable bed - much needed after a hard day shopping! The shower was hot and powerful with plenty of clean towels every day. There's plenty of storage and a TV with news channels galore - who wants to sit and watch tv when you've got New York city to explore?The staff were helpful and there was fresh bagels and juice every morning.I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends and hope to make a return trip soon.
217,1749,"Apr 14 2005 	Be careful ladies!	Unless you want an unwanted mid night visitor don't stay here. Fire escapes come right up to the window and none of the windows lock. Rooms are very small and the hotel itself is run down. While the location is great for your own safety, STAY ELSEWHERE."
218,1749,"Apr 12 2005	What a nighmare	What a disappointment this hotel turned out to be. The elevators were broken most of the time, which caused a great inconvenience to an injured person in our party. The rooms are so small a suit case cannot even open up on the floor. There is about three feet of space between the wall and the bed around the perimeter of the room. The rooms were somewhat clean, but the halls, walls and floors are filthy. Don't stay at this hotel. There are much nicer places at the same or even cheaper prices."
219,1749,Apr 7 2005	Terrible!	Having read the reviews which seemed to be 50/50 I was not too bothered as the photos looked good. What a mistake !! When people said the rooms were tiny this was no joke !! I have never been that &quot; fussy&quot; and having stayed in NY before I know that you get what you pay for but this was crazy !! And where did the Trousdale bar/restaurant vanish to ??? no sign of it when we were there. We were told that the hotel could order in for us.Reception staff were very helpful but we moved hotel having just stayed one night. Such a pity as it looks great in photos and the location is wonderful.
220,1749,"Apr 3 2005	Tiny rooms!	The main problem i had with this hotel was that our room was tiny. It was, basically, a single room, with a double bed in it (and not much room for anything else). There was no where to hang up more than a couple of coats, so, we lived out of our suitcases for 4 days (which we had to keep moving about to make space). Also, the pipes made a racket, first thing in the morning.However, it is in an ideal location (a minutes walk from Broadway). So, for the price we paid for the room, it was a bargin. But, i really wouldn't recommend this hotel because the rooms were so small. Our next stop was the 'Comfort Inn' in Downtown Memphis, the rooms were massive, good breakfast included, free internet access (I would definately recommend that hotel!)Good luck in finding a good hotel!"
221,1749,"Mar 23 2005 	DONT GO!!!	Just avoid it. This must be one of the worst holes you could find yourself in.Unless you're in for the down and dirty New York experience, complete with your typical deli around the corner and the porn shop next door."
222,1749,"Mar 20 2005	It's not all that bad!	I stayed here with my boyfriend to celebrate my 21st from 26th Jan - 30th Jan 2005. It was much better than expected after reading some of the reviews, afterall we only paid 330 each so i wasnt expecting the Hilton.It's in a fab location, i have no complaints about the hotel. Obviously as with everyone else the coffee machine didn't work (but i don't like coffee ;-) so i wasn't bothered, plus there's a starbucks on every corner) etc etc, but it really isn't that bad a hotel! I've stayed in a lot worse, and the location more than makes up for it.The bed was comfy, the shower (after having to get the caretaker to show us how it worked) was ok, the radiator worked (too well sometimes!), the TV was mainly news...but i wasnt in New York to watch TV, i was there to see the sights and do lots of shopping! If you're thinking about booking this hotel and you're on a budget, go ahead! If you have more money to spend, perhaps look for somewhere else, but i'd probably stay here again because of the location and the price. After all you get what you pay for. I hope this helps, and it doesn't put anyone off! Thanks for reading! x"
223,1749,"Mar 2 2005	Hotel Amsterdam is a nightmare.	After a 10 hour all round journey, and arriving in New York at 9pm our party of four females were looking forward to getting to the hotel to relax, what a let down. Upon arrival we were shown to our rooms (723 and 725) by the polite concierge. There was only a queen bed in each of the 2 rooms booked. We immediately returned to the reception desk to query this (as we had booked 2 rooms with single beds). The reception guy was extremely arrogant and unhelpful and said it was basically what you get when booking through a third party (last minute). I informed him that we had confirmed the rooms with the hotel direct before travelling, and he basically filled us with more bull. When I asked to use the phone to clarify this with the booking company, he would not allow me. We just could not win, and in the end fatigue won the day and so accepted the rooms with the promice that single bedded rooms would come free the following day (totally not true). The room was clean, and yes fresh towels were put in daily, but that was the only advantage. Our window looked directly onto a brick wall, (so much for the city views), only one bedside lamp worked, and the t.v had no suitable free view channels, and you have to pay approx $11.99 to view a movie. The walls are extremely thin and you can hear everything the people in the opposite rooms are saying. The bed was comfy but the quilt was as thin as ever (does 2 tog exist) considering it was -2 degrees outside. Fortunately our room was warm, unlike our friends. However the radiator was so close to the side of the bed you burnt your legs every time you got in and out. The bathroom was'nt much better. The shower thermostat was uncontrollable, either too cold or scalding hot, and most of the water ended up out of the tub. There was no coffee maker, and no room safe in either of the rooms as stated on their internet site. The coffee maker in the lobby was out of use and had been presumably since last year, and there was no complimentary breakfast as suggested. Flasks of hot water were provided but there was no fresh supply of milk. I suppose what made us feel a bit better was we weren't the only ones affected. In the 3 days spent at the hotel we witnessed the same complaints from 7 other holiday goers. My advise to anybody looking for a long weekend break is to look for a better hotel, this is the pits. I,m certainly gonna try and get some compensation back considering the inaccuracy of hotel details."
224,1749,Mar 1 2005	Not a bad little place	DO NOT USE THE HOTEL TELEPHONE. the staff were quite rude and they did not advise us when we were well over our $100 limit for the phone bill. The rooms were small but very modern and clean. The location is absolutly fantastic. There is no restaurant but this is in the process of being developed.All in all we did not compain but we would have wished for more space.
225,1749,"Feb 15 2005	We loved this place!	We spent three nights at this hotel from the 4th December 2004 to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary. I just wanted to say that the hotel has had some bad reviews on this site and want to put the record straight!The room was really clean with lots of storage space, a desk, tv etc and the bathroom was spotless with lots of towels. The location could not have been better - literally round the corner from Times Sq and 2 mins from the Rockerfeller Centre. The staff were incredibly polite and helpful and there were piles of free bagels, fruit juice, tea and coffee every morning.The room was small but certainly big enough for two people to share - and anyway; who goes to NYC to be in their room the whole time!!?? I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone!"
226,1749,"Feb 10 2005	Dont get your hopes up.....	I stayed with my partner at the Amsterdam Court from 30 December 2004 to 5 January 2005. The location of the hotel is fantastic, Times Square and Rockerfeller Centre are just around the corner and there is a subway at the end of the street from which you can get to almost anywhere in New York. The rooms are really small (literally 2 feet around the edges of the bed) but they are clean. however, at the time we were visiting the hotel seemed to be going through some sort of renovation as the stairwell was undecorated and there were whole areas of the hotel which were out of bounds. The room was quite noisy and we were located at the rear of the hotel which meant that our window looked out onto a brick wall. I also found the staff to be quite unfriendly and although we were told breakfast was included in the price, when we got there we were advised it was cancelled. I wouldnt recommend that anyone with high expectations visit this hotel as it really is average and there are much better hotels avalable for the same price. However, it is New York so how much time would you spend in the room anyway? If you dont care what the hotel is like but just want a central location this could be the hotel for you. Otherwise.. dont stay there!!"
227,1749,"Feb 9 2005	Best Location Imaginable!!	I agree with most on this one! I could not believe how close to Times Square and Broadway we were(literally 20 second walk!), it was Great!The rooms are cleaned everyday + clean sets of towels are provided daily. I found the room size comfortable and cosy. The staff could have been a bit more cheerful but they were very helpful e.g they recommended must see places, arranged our transport to JFK for a good price. I would ignore the really negative comments - these are from people who expect the Ritz for 20 dollars a night! There was 1 bummer - we made 5 phone calls to the UK - each around 10-15 mins. This cost us 145 dollars upon check-out! My own fault really!  I will be staying here again when I return to NY. (I will probably buy a phone card)"
228,1749,"Feb 1 2005	you trade space for location	I just returned from a two night stay with my mom to see a couple of shows. I tried to choose a hotel based on price in order to spend more money on shows and dinners. The location was really fantasitic. If you dont want to spend any time in the room, then it's probably OK. If you want to spend any time in the hotel, go somewhere else. The queen room was approximately 9X12. NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE. There is also no desk or space if you need to work/ conduct business. The bathrooms were adequate, but the water didn't stay in the shower at all. It is fine if all you need is somewhere to sleep for the night, and the location can't be beat, but dont expect any frills. The coffee bar was broken, and there is no breakfast/ room service available. The lock on the door was broken, and our room was extremely cold, but the staff brought in a radiator when we asked for more heat. Overall, the hotel served our needs, but I wont stay there again."
229,1749,"Jan 29 2005	The Staff Are So Rude!!!	I stayed at this hotel in January, 2005.When we first checked in, the girl at the desk asked for a credit card, i only own a debit card which although good enough to pay for the room it was not good enough for her. She made us put down a hundred dollars deposit, a figure she seemed to just make-up. As i had pre paid for the room i don't feel this was acceptable. All thoughout my stay i spoke to different members of staff, all i found to be rude, unfriendly and unhelpful. With this exception my stay would have been pleasant, the room was clean and a good size. The maid service was excellent. There was no view which i was a little disappointed about. Also the restaurant has closed which i was not informed about before my stay.I would not stay at this hotel again."
230,1749,"Jan 28 2005	Room was clean but that's about it!	Good points - Room was clean on arrival and cleaned everyday Location was great.Unfortunately the good points run out there. The rooms were very small, staff rude, no breakfast supplied (restaurant was closed down), no capuccino bar, no hot water etc etc. Would not stay there again."
231,1749,"Jan 27 2005	Small but Quaint	My husband and I planned a trip for New York from November 25th - December 1, 2004. I had already made reservations at this hotel and then looked at trip advisor. When I did I saw some very bad reviews. After going on our trip I decided I really needed to write a review. Our room was VERY small. BUT it was in a WONDERFUL location. The room was very clean. We didn't spend a lot of time there of course because we were in New York City. But the time we did spend in there was a great experience. I would go there again."
232,1749,"Jan 26 2005	Great Location Clean Rooms	I am a Tour Operator and my background is also in the hotel industry. I have site-inspected many properties in my career and I'm a self-proclaimed 'hotel snob.' I was in town - not on business - but to do the tourist thing and meet up with a friend. I felt some apprehension about my staying here for 2 nights (Jan 13-14 '05), esp. after reading some of the reviews I read online. I did a lot of research and shopping around before making my reservations here. I decided to take a chance... and my stay turned out great! It's not the Plaza or the 'W' by any means, but the place has some charm to it. Just keep your expectations in check. The staff at the desk were very friendly. The room was VERY CLEAN. My bathroom was spotless- something I find very seldom in my travels to ANY property (I'm very picky about this point). My room attendant was very pleasant &amp; accommodating. Please realize that the room size is VERY small. I chuckled to myself when I entered the room (through a dimly lit hallway), but it can accommodate two people cozily. Decor &amp; bath amenties were nice and well thought out. My room reminded me of a cabin on a cruise, only larger, w/lots of storage space/cabinets. The inside view - well, it was dimal, but I knew I wasn't going to overlook Central Park. Try to request a street view, if possible. The LOCATION - absolutely FANTASTIC! Just a short walk (down the block really) to the action of Broadway, the theaters &amp; Times Square! Overall - a great value and I was very pleased!!"
233,1749,"Jan 21 2005	Location Location Location	I booked my 3 night trip to NY in November staying at the Amsterdam Court Hotel and after reading some of the reviews I was wondering what to expect.Don't worry!! I'm sure there are much nicer hotels in NY, with bigger rooms, more facilities, etc but if you are looking at only using your room as somewhere to sleep, it is ideal. The room we had, although small, was clean, the bed was made every day and we were supplied with fresh towels daily. The location however couldn't be better. Right on Broadway, 5 minute walk to the heart of Times Square and if you want to venture further afield there is an entrance to the underground network close by.I would not hesitate in recommending this hotel and if you are intent on spending a lot of time stuck in your hotel !"
234,1749,"Jan 19 2005	Excellent for location price and service	I just returned from a five night stay at the hotel and found it to be in an excellent location. The rooms were small and had a lack of natural light but i was rarely in mine during the day anyway. They were very clean and bed was comfy. Some rooms are a lot bigger than others so ask for a change of room if you are not happy. I would recommend this hotel as the service was great, it was a total bargain (we paid about 20 per night for it through expedia as a package) and the hotel bar is fantastic. Brilliant for an upmarket budget option with everything for a comfortable stay right in the middle of the action."
235,1749,"Jan 10 2005	Not Bad...but	If you stay in NY for the hotels, choose the Plaza. If you need a hotel for basic lodging and a place to rest your head, the Amsterdam Court will suffice....but, no cappucinio bar (machine broke) and no offer to compensate from staff for the absence of ammeneties. Room clean and as advertised. Overall, OK, but would not stay again."
236,1749,"Jan 4 2005	An honest review	Having just returned from a 4 night stay at the Amsterdam Court I wanted to add my view.Having read some of the previous reviews listed here I was concerned at what was to lay ahead of my stay.Upon arrival we went straight to the check in, the lobby was fairly small but all went smoothly and the lady on reception was very helpful.The lift up to the 5th floor was a little bumpy and slow but was ok. after this we used the stairs for most of the stay.As we approched the room I was a little nervous as to what we would find, but all these fears were taken away as soon as we entered the room. The room was not the biggest we have stayed in but was perfectly exceptable. There was a nice double bed which was firm and comfortable the bedding was in good condition, bathroom had plenty of towels and overall the room was very clean. The only down side to the room was the lack of a safe.We had maid service on all 4 days of our stay (including new years day)The staff on the door and in reception were all friendly and very helpfull.Did'nt sample the bagels for breakfast so can't comment on these.If your booked to stay here, don't worry about the poor comments; this hotel was great for our stay in NYC and is well located."
237,1749,"Dec 29 2004	Cheap 3star hotel with Excellent Location	I have just read some of the reviews on this site - first I should mention that it has been a long time since I stayed in this Hotel, but as the other Brits seem to have found the hotel up to standard I am going to stick up for it here. When we stayed we had no reservation, and managed to get an en-suite room, with a double bed, at a reasonable price. If you pay for a budget hotel, you should't expect too much! The location was perfect, right off Broadway, and for the price we paid we had no complaints.I can only suggest that the people who were paying extortionate amounts for a 3*** hotel were ripped off by their booking agencies, and not by the hotel! Do your homework first.If only there were more good quality budget hotels right in the centre of the city."
238,1749,"Dec 28 2004	Great location value for money (depends on how much you paid)	I read a lot of mixed reviews about the hotel and wanted to put things in perspective for those considering this hotel. There is a general trend in the past reviews that those who hated it also overpaid for the rooms and those who loved it (like ourselves) paid a reasonable price for it. We checked in on Dec 23 and out on Dec 26 for $99/nite and absolutely loved the hotel for its location - it's 5 min walk from Time Sq and right smack in the middle of Broadway's theatre district, not to mention just 10min walk from Rockefeller Center. Of course if you want to stay there this coming New Year Eve's weekend, it will be $255/nite and you will definitely hate the hotel for that price! (or maybe yourself for paying that!)It's a tastefully decorated &quot;boutique&quot; hotel (read : small) and since we only showered and slept in it, it didn't matter to us....for those looking to stay indoor to enjoy a big luxurious hotel room, my advice is don't come to NYC - you're missing the point here!Breakfast was simple bagel and coffee - you can get better elsewhere and you should - we didn't come to NYC to chew on cold bagels and drink bad coffee anyway. My only complaint is that the bed are way too soft - you just sink into them. However we were so tired after walking the city each day that we slept like a baby - even if the bed was too soft.P/S: our $99/nite rates were booked thru Expedia....the hotel's own website charges $120++/nite"
239,1749,"Dec 24 2004	Would Never Stay There Again	After calling days before our arrival to verify that we would indeed have a room with two twin beds we were told upon arrival that all they had was a room with one king bed but after some delay they said that they would send up a roll-away bed. The roll-away was so saggy in the middle that sleep was next to impossible and the king bed was not much better. The room temperature was extremely cold but we were told that the thermostat was central to the entire hotel and they could not adjust it for one room. That was the first night. It was late so we went to bed. The next morning after complaining again about the temperature they reluctantly said that they could possible bring a portable heater to the room. This should have been suggested on the first night. The 24 hour coffee was non-existent since the machine was broken. We never saw the sunny reading room that was advertised. On our last day we went to the complimentary breakfast to find one bagel left, no milk for the coffee, and no one around to help us. I would never stay here again and would be reluctant to stay at any of their sister properties."
240,1749,"Dec 22 2004	Filthy rooms rude staff non accomidating	We booked Amsterdam Court Hotel through Hotels. We were guanteed two double beds, we had 3 people. When we got to the hotel, they told us since we didn't directly book through them, we were not guranteed anything, and would only get one double bed. When they finally brought up the dirty roll away cot to the room, we could barely fit it anywhere, we had to climb all over the bed, cot and suitcases just to get around the room. The room was filthy. We spoke to the manager, who had no customer service skills, and asked him why we had to pay for 300.00 a night for a cot, he simply said well that's the price you pay to stay in New York. I would never reccomend this hotel to anyone. Hotels.com found us another hotel to stay in, but we had to spend one night at Amsterdam, they suppled only 2 towels, we called for more, but they never brought them. Then when we checked out, they insisted we pay an early cancellation fee. This hotel is filthy and the staff is rude, and very unaccomidating!"
241,1749,"Dec 5 2004	Fitted our needs perfectly	With this hotel you get what it says on the tin. Amsterdam Court is in aperfect location, just around the corner from Times Square, and within walking distance to all the main sites, including the Empire State Building and Macy's for those who like to shop! The hotel has a welcoming lobby and very attentive staff, we stayed in room 514, and it was clean, and boutique like. The bed was extremely comfy and the bathroom had a great power shower excellent after a long day pounding the streets. I really don't know why other reviewers say the rooms are small, while not huge by US standards I have stayed in smaller in Boston and paid more money for it. Basically don't expect swank, but it's value for money and I would not hesitate to stay there again."
242,1749,"Dec 4 2004	Do not believe all you read	We have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel, After reading some of the reviews from previous guests we were not looking forward to ouy stay, However i would fully reccomend this hotel for a short stay in the city. It was clean with maid service every day, The staff were allways there and were very helpful, The continental breakfast was a real bonus to start your day and the location could not have been better. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would rather spend their money in the city then on a swanky hotel."
243,1749,"Nov 29 2004	Hotel Room Roulette--How's Your Luck?	It has been almost three years since I stayed at this hotel so please keep that in mind for this review. I noticed the very mixed reviews here so I thought my perspective might shed some light on things. When my husband and I check into our room at the Amsterdam Court we were disappointed. The room was small, dingy, and had a lot of street noise. When we sat down on and then tried to lie on the bed, we were were appalled. The mattress was lumpy and very, very caved in to the point where I truly didn't think we would be able to sleep on it without hurting our backs. I phoned the front desk to complain that the bed wasn't at all flat and the receptionist replied, &quot;Oh, they're all that way.&quot; After sputtering for a moment, I told her I doubted that they were all this bad and I stressed the point that the mattress was really caved and she then relented and said that she'd send someone up to show us other rooms. A very polite fellow arrived ten minutes later. He showed us a second room that was even dingier and tinier than the first. It was closet-like even by NYC standards. I supposed it was quieter, but that was the only thing going for it. By now, my normally easy-going husband was beside himself and said that the room was no good. The hotel employee then asked what we wanted and we told him that the bed in the first room was no good. He said, &quot;Oh, the bed!&quot; He then led us to a third room that had a nice big, flat, king bed. The room was also clean, and nicely (if cheaply) decorated, and quiet. It was the boutique-like setting we had been expecting! We stayed for three days and enjoyed our room and the fact that we were not paying a whole lot. We had no more problems for the rest of our stay. If I had only seen the last, good room I might have given the hotel a four stars, but since I saw the other two rooms I'm giving it two stars. Actually, it should be more like 1.5 stars because of the receptionist's initial response to my complaint. I have been afraid to go back to this hotel because I couldn't be sure we could get one of the really nice rooms again. Anyway, if you're on a tight budget, are going in the off season, and are ready to insist upon a room change, you might take your chances here. You MIGHT get lucky. Then again, you might not. Why risk it?"
244,1749,"Nov 24 2004	Excellent Hotel for People on a Budget	I stayed in the Amsterdam Court Hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of November 2004 with my partner. We were a little apprehensive after reading such bad reviews on this hotel. When we arrived our fears had gone, the reception area is nicely decorated with exceptionally helpful staff. The room was very clean with a double bed, shower/bathroom, TV, hair dryer and steam iron. It also got cleaned when we wanted them to. The location was perfect, just round the corner from Time Square and Broadway. The bar/lounge was a excellent place for a quiet cocktail with a relaxing atmosphere. If we ever go back to New York i won't hesitate in using this hotel again."
245,1749,Nov 18 2004	Give this hotel a break!	After reading the last few reviews of this hotel I was beginning to get nightmares and it really spoilt the usual excitement you feel as your trip draws near. I need not have worried all was fine. I must say this is a budget hotel and I knew that when I booked it and you have to be realistic about it you get what youpay for and I got a really good deal. The whole trip including flight and hotel for four nights was 500GBP. I paid that 5 years ago and stayed in Loews in Lexington Ave. The rooms are tiny but spotlessly clean but you dont go to New York to stay in the hotel all day.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the candlelit bar was lovely. I do appreciate if you have paid a lot of money to stay here you would expect more but some of the negative comments written about this hotel are totally over the top. The real beauty of this hotel is the location - perfect. If you have booked this hotel dont let it spoil the build up to your holiday worrying about what people are writing.
246,1749,"Nov 9 2004	Worse Hotel	The Amsterdam which bills itself as a modern boutique hotel in the Broadway / Times Square are of NY ought to call itself a rat hole vs. a hotel. At the time of chek-in, you get a terrible feeling about things to come. When you get out of the elevator, you smell strong vinegar to cover to urine odors. Then you find out that the supposed hotel has public restrooms on the floors next to your room. You are awaken at 2 and 3 a.m. hearing people fighting over the use of the bathroom.To top it off they charge you higher rates than well known hotel chains. $255 for Saturday night.Avoid at all costs....sleep at the train station or airport rather than experiencing this rat hole."
247,1749,"Nov 9 2004	Mixed views	Price:We paid 165 a night, which is Europe would get you a very good hotel. In New York in general, the hotel prices are based on availability - we inadvertently chose marathon weekend, and struggled to find a room anywhere. Worth noting (having read a previous review) that the Waldorf-Astoria was $450 a night, so way more expensive. So, I would class the hotel as expensive, although no more than a similar hotel elsewhere in NYC would have cost that weekend.Wildlife: We awoke on our first night to hear a rustling noise in the corner of the room. Turning the light on, we discovered a small mouse running across our luggage. Not what one expects in a 165 a night hotel! We went straight to reception (at 3am) and were told there were no other rooms that night, but that we could switch in the morning. So, we were given a mouse trap and went back to bed. Closer inspection showed that the skirting board around the room had been plugged in several places with 'expanding foam filler' - so it was clear that they have tried in vain to cure an obvious mice problem.Comfort:The original room was quite small. It was clean etc, but the temperature was very high and the air conditioner broken.Room number two:The second room was great. Much larger, nice and cool, and no sign of mice. Much more like the room we would expect for the price. Had this been the first room we got, I'd have given a 4/5 rating.Breakfast:Breakfast was bagels and coffee (as much as you want). The bagels were nice, coffee was very nice and it was just right to set us up for the day - NYC has so many food experiences that we didn't want to fill up on breakfast in the hotel anyway.Staff:Without exception the staff were all friendly and helpful. The response to our issue with the mouse was exactly what you would want.Location:Just up from Radio City on West 50th between 7th and 8th Avenue. 20 seconds walk from 50th Street Metro station, which links you with all the major sights with ease. 5 mins walk to Time Square. 15 mins walk from Port Authority Bus Terminal. Excellent location all in all.Overall: A good hotel let down by the excessive price. That said, I am sure that other similar hotels in the area would be just as pricey."
248,1749,"Nov 6 2004 	A rip-off.	I just stayed at the Amsterdam Court for three nights. I made a point of not showing up at the hotel until I was ready to go to sleep, so that depression wouldn't set in.3-star rating at best. It's a dreary, dark, run-down and tired place. Friends were staying at the Waldorf-Astoria at the same time, at $210, they got a a better rate than I did, at $230 a night. That ought to tell you something about the way to go. Staff was unhelpful and rude, except for a lady receptionist named Jackie, who really tried to help locate my lost credit card. Thanks to the lack of empathy and interest of her fellow workers I lost my flight.Avoid this place. You can get a better deal elsewhere."
249,1749,"Nov 2 2004	Turn around and run!!!	If this hotel was priced at $39.95 a night it would be too much !!!! Dark and dreary and unkept. We did not receive maid service for 3 of the 4 days we were there. The elevator was shaky at best, the lounge had just opened the day we got there and they assured us that the restaurant would open the next day..........it never did. Do not believe what you see in the pictures!! It does not look that good and the rooms are so small that when we asked for a rollaway bed they asked us if we were sure we wanted to try to get it in there. No safe, no cofeemaker.....no nothing worth the money. Be afraid, be very afraid."
250,1749,"Oct 25 2004	Great Location and Quaint but...	We stayed here in early October for 3 nights because it was within our budget. The rooms were clean with basic, but contemporary appointments. Our room was very small and the air conditioning unit was VERY noisy. The &quot;New York Style&quot; breakfast was meager, with stale bagels and no fruit. The staff were helpful and polite. The location is really great if you want to be in the midtown/time square area. It is reasonable for the budget conscious, but next time I will increase my allotment to stay at another hotel."
251,1749,"Oct 13 2004	A great little hotel	This hotel - for the money - is great!Perfectly placed on broadway / times square.The staff were so helpful during our stay prior to our cruise.They even let us use their baggage room after our cruise as the plane was delayed some 12 hours!They are at present redecorating / refurbishing so it will be alot brighter when finished. Yes the rooms are smallish, and perhaps a little tired looking at the moment, but this is far outweighed by the fact that this is a supoer base to visit New York, coupled with the friendly and most helpful staff and the low prices.We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends!"
252,1749,"Oct 13 2004	A little gem	I recently celebrated my 50th birthday in New York City, and spent six nights at the Amsterdam Court Hotel (on 50th Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues.) The service was perfectly fine...the decor was charming. The rooms were very clean, and housekeeping service good. There was some inconsistency in the number of wash cloths provided, but in the grand scheme of things, not a big deal to me. The rooms were not huge, but neither are most hotel rooms in NYC...besides, that's not what I necessarily go there to enjoy. The lobby was in the process of renovation...and every day I noted marked improvement and progress. There was a neat little bar on the lower level, with great music and a cool atmosphere. A new restaurant is slated to open soon (if it isn't already). I would go there again in a heartbeat, and plan to make it my first choice next time I visit NY."
253,1749,Oct 8 2004	Not bad at all	After reading the reviews posted here I was very concerned about what I would find at the Amsterdam Court. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes the room was small and dingy - but we were asleep most of the time we were in it! The bathroom was also small but very clean with an excellent shower. My main criteria for a city centre hotel is that it is in the city centre and is clean. The Amsterdam Court is both of these - the location is excellent and we found the staff friendly.
254,1749,"Oct 4 2004	avoid !	Poor hotel in a great location. Tiny and dimly lit room. Rude staff. Breakfast facilities are beyond a joke. No staff serving, just self service with warm coffee from a flask. Good points ??? ummmmm .... the bar wasnt too bad.Avoid !!!!!!"
255,1749,"Oct 2 2004	dreary depressing hotel	Our room which was to have two double beds, was so small that a cell would be more descriptive. There was a queen size bed with about fourteen inches on each side, a tiny dirty window looking into an airshaft, a tiny bathroom, not enough lighting to read. I felt like I was in a refrigerated box car. We booked through expedia so the cost was $272.28, outrageously high for this hotel. The promised valet parking also was not available."
256,1749,"Sep 28 2004	The good the bad and the...	I recently spent a three night stay at the Amsterdam Court Hotel. From the time of check-in the stay was off to a bad start. The hotel neglected to mention that they were going through a lobby renovation that resulted in the entire area being stripped of furniture, covered in plaster dust and the restaurant, lounge and breakfast room closed and blocked off. The front desk staff was less than impressive; they checked us in rather quickly and without much trouble but, when we got up to our room we found another guest already in the room! They had just checked someone else into the same room and we walked in on this poor woman unpacking! Back down to the lobby, a half hour later and left without an apology and with the feeling that the mishap was somehow our fault, we were in our room. The room itself was the bright spot of the stay; clean, in fairly good condition and fairly large by NY standards. As a whole, the desk staff was apalling(all shifts). We came in after a show and late dinner(after midnight) and the front desk clerk did not even lift his head to acknowledge our entrance. We could have been anyone off the street. While we were waiting for the malfunctioning elevator, we peered over the desk top to see what had such a strong hold on his attention, only to discover he was surfing the internet for porn!! Very comforting. I expect more for $205/night! I tried to send these same comments to the owners of the hotel but their website does not offer any way to communicate with them...I wonder why!?"
257,1749,"Sep 26 2004	Very good Hotel	Don't believe what other reviews here say about the Amsterdam Court. Ok, the rooms are tiny, but they are clean and nicely decorated. There is enough light in the room to do everything you like to do. Moreover complimentary breakfast is available too. Best of all: The Location: A few steps away from Times Square and many Broadway theatres. A subway station is almost next door as well as restaurants, a grocery and many shops. The amsterdam will stay my favourite choice for NYC."
258,1749,Sep 23 2004	Only $400 (Cdn) a Night - What a 'Steal' (for them)	Never in my life (over 500 hotel nights) have I ever experienced so little for so much.Instead of paying US$273 (over $400 Canadian) I think a price for the value would be closer to US$60-$70.Find out who owns this property and buy their stock: its a guaranteed profit maker.
259,1749,"Sep 21 2004	What A Dump!	As Bette Davis would say WHAT A DUMP! - I was extremely disappointed in this place - the only saving grace was the $20 parking across the street at the Gershwin Theater (with validation). We had a small room for 3 people - we had asked for 2 beds, was told on the website that it was guaranteed, but instead received a rollaway. The shower water would not regulate properly - it went from hot to scalding - no cold water! Can you believe that!! The hotel is also in the middle of renovations so the entire lobby is being painted and is a mess. Not worth the $250 I paid for one night!!!!"
260,1749,"Sep 20 2004	Stay somewhere else	First of all great location and that's it. Went to New York with my brother and was given a queens size bed even though we had booked two singles. They did give us a roll away though WOW!. The Hotel is very easy to miss and when we arrived at reception the staff were very abrupt as if to say &quot;This is what you've you've got and your three thousand miles away from home so what you going to do about it&quot; The room was lighted by a what must have been a 15 watt light and you needed a torch to find your personal effects. The toilet was cramped and you had to sit at an angle to do your &quot;thing&quot;. Ok if you were missing your right leg. We had no natural daylight and our view was an alley. The breakfast consisted of a plate of bagels and lukewarm coffee. The lift was as slow as a snail and we ended up using the stairs most of the time. My sister stayed at the Milford Plazza and this was far superior. Stay there if you can and dont worry about the extra cost, it will be worth it!"
261,1749,"Sep 19 2004	Absolutely vile!!!	As our first choice was being renovated,we took this one instead.BIG MISTAKE! Absolutely vile!The pics made it look good,boutiquey even,but,boy,are you ever in for a disappointment.The gloomiest rooms we have ever stayed in.Room327 was where we laid our heads in March 2004.No daylight at all,tired decor too,didn't help either.It was prison-like in fact.Horrible corridors,dreadful halls(creepy almost)I could go on...And as for the staff,only the young doorman warrants a favourable mention,the rest were surly,unhelpful and unpleasant to anyone they spoke to,from what we could see.And those famous NY bagels..If you have all your own teeth,then maybe you can chew on those blighters,me?I'm still trying to break open the first one.Stoaters,we call them in Glasgow! And watch out for the marble floor,I went on my nelly entering the dining room(the stairs there should be marked clearly)Would we stay there again-what do you think?Would we recommend it?Not in a million years!Sorry,but that is our true opinion of this hotel."
262,1749,Sep 18 2004	Great Location - really nice	We booked the Carter hotel originally - but after reading the terrible reviews on here we changed and upgraded to the Amsterdam Court - and I'm glad we did. It was great - the location is amazing - you step out of the hotel and just down the street is Times Square. And yet the room was really quiet in the nights. The air conditioning unit in the window was a little noisy - but not that bad. The room was just as published in the brouchure - really modern mix of browns - really smart.We did experience problems checking in - they did not have a reservation for us - but this was entirely the fault of our holiday company - not the hotel. They were really cool about it and said to just check into a room and they would contact the holiday company on our behalf in the next few days. It was eventually sorted and Troy the manager was great about it.I really would recommend the Amsterdam Court Hotel for its great location and quality of room. the only down point was the room was a bit gloomy - you did need the light on in the daytime - as it had an internal view of the building. but hey - you are in NYC - why on earth would you be in your room in the daytime or anytime other than to sleep!!Check in - i thouroughly recommend it. The bar man (Scott) was also great- it was really nice to call into the bar before a night out.Loved it!!
263,1749,"Sep 17 2004	Small but well formed	We booked this hotel partly because it was cheap on expedia and because the reviews on this very site told us what we wanted to know! We stayed 3 nights in summary, POSTIVE 1) It was clean and comfortable 2) Breakfast was plentful 3) There was a bar attached 4) It was a great location close to subway and time sq 5) Staff we friendly and polite 6) Price NEGATIVE 1) rooms we stayed in (ground floor) had 4 doors all within 6ft, this lead to a resonable amount of noise from other guests 2) No natural light in the room at all 3) Breakfast was bigs bagels, cheap coffe and fake OJ 4) The bar was more expensive than London about 5 a bottle of bud (in happy hour with the dollar being weak!) 5) small rooms, i.e. so small not even the little coffe making equiment standard in so many hotels. Stay here if your young, want to see NYC and are not rich, dont if you have kids or can afford better."
264,1749,"Sep 14 2004	What's with all the negative reviews? It's a Great Hotel!	OK, prior to my trip I had carefully researched good places to stay at so I can make the most of my stay. So upon finding this hotel thru an online booking site- I wanted to see what people thought of it. I read all the reviews and some made me worry about this hotel- that I literally had nightmares days before my trip! So, I took a leap of faith and just booked it. I figure I only need a place to sleep in the Big Apple! so here are the positives that i think will prove the other reviews wrong!PROSLOCATION: Great Location! steps away from the 1 &amp; 9 Red subway lines that will take you to downtown. Blocks away from Time Square and literally steps away from any major broadway shows!STAFF: Very accomodating and helpful! we requested a double room, but to no avail they provided a cot for an extra bed at NO CHARGE!FREE BREAKFAST: Grant it that it's a Bagel- but let me tell you- it sets you up for the next 3 hours! NYC Bagels are like bagels like nowehere else, not even in California!CLEAN ROOMS: Clean rooms- great shower/water pressure...aircondition worked great. Very simple great decor! i loved the blanket, it was a down comforter hehehe :)RESTAURANT: There's a restaurant (Trousdale) in the lobby and they have Happy Hours from M-F- what a great way to wind down your day!CONSROOM SIZE: Yes the rooms are small- but clean! if you are closterphobic and you're like 7 ft tall- forget about it! iF YOU DON'T SMOKE make sure you request for a non-smoking room. they first placed us in a smoking room- (which stunk!) but if you're a smoker- it don't matter! Room's a bit dim- but who cares! No view- again who cares!ELEVATOR: Was Sloooooow! get a work out and just walk up the stairs! Other than that, it's a great hotel for the price! so all the peeps who are writing negative stuff and not the realistic deal- must be hallucinating because this ain't no W hotel- if that's what you want- i suggest you walk down time square and check into the W! give this Hotel a break! it's great! besides you came to NYC to see NYC not to sleep in the hotel! I will definitely book this place again!"
265,1749,"Sep 14 2004	Dark and depressing in the bright lights of the big city!	I just want to say that I was expecting a tourist class hotel along the lines of a Days Inn or Holiday Inn but although the room was clean (and you can't fault the location) this was a depressing hotel, the worse I have ever stayed in. My advice would be to book the Days Inn around the corner (at least you know what to expect from a chain) but if it is too late then ask for a room at the front overlooking the street such as 310 (we moved to this room as the water pipes and the air conditioning unit were too noisy in the first room... although the toilet was blocked when we arrived in the second room!!!). We stayed in the hotel at the end of August 2004."
266,1749,"Sep 7 2004	Great Location and Friendly Staff!	After reading all the various reviews here we were unsure as to what we would be turning up to last weekend. When we got there we were more than pleasantly surprised. We had none of the problems described below and yes other than the lack of natural daylight in the room this was an excellent value for money place to stay. The location is fabulous and only minutes walk from Times Square. Very close to 50th Street subway and close to a number of great places to eat. We especially enjoyed the late night cocktail lounge!!Friendly staff, great location, clean rooms and we'll certainly be back!"
267,1749,"Sep 1 2004	Great location!	This was my first time in NYC. Stayed there Aug 17 to Aug 22. Via the internet, I got a great price on the room $135 for each nite. The room, as others have said, was very small, but it was clean. The bathroom was pretty and clean, but the water temperature does fluctuate quite a bit. However, the location of this hotel is fantastic. It's close to two subway stations, in the midst of restaurants and stores that are open 24 hours, right by Broadway and a few blocks from Times Square. It was well worth the money and the small room inconvenience for the location and the price I paid. I would definitely stay there again if the price is right."
268,1749,"Aug 28 2004	no frills-great location	The best thing about the place is it's ideal location near all theaters, restaurant row, etc. The rooms are quite small-(although VERY clean) and the lobby and hallways are dark and dingy. The breakfast was held each morning in a small hallway-like area which was very crowded. The hallways and public areas were un-air-conditioned and the elevator was....quirky-with no visible inspection certificate either. I used the stairs. Hot water was intermittent and the pipes rattled noisily on those rare occasions when you could get the shower temperature just right. Internet service didn't really work most of the time. Try to get a room on the 4th floor or above to avoid a &quot;view&quot; of a brick wall! The staff's attitude ranged from mildly rude to quite friendly; they seem to be refurbishing a restaurant area. Basically, it's a place to leave your things and sleep while you stay in NYC."
269,1749,"Aug 14 2004	Not too bad for our budget	After reading the reviews we were quite prepared for the worse. It wasn't that bad after all. We stayed here from Aug 1st - Aug 5th. The hot water in the shower worked, the little mini air-con worked too. The staff were a bit strict adhearing to their policies but still polite. Coming prepared with the knowledge the the rooms were small, made it more easy to settle in even though there were 4 of us (2 kids and 2 adults). We were ready to comprimise space for location and save us extra to do some shopping. Most other hotels in the area cost 50% more. One more thing, Empire State Building was bad....took us an hour and a half of queuing just to get to the viewing deck!"
270,1749,"Aug 4 2004	Good location	Good location is abot the best way to describe this hotel. Most of the staff were pleasant enough. The room was comfortable, if a little small. The view was an alley way which made the room very dark. Although we loved NYC and will be returning in the future, we won't be returning to this hotel. It is defiitely in need of redecorating. It didn't look like it had been done since the 1930's, and one of the lifts was rather vicious."
271,1749,"Aug 2 2004	Can we have the room that we reserved and paid for?	The problems started at check-in. We booked and PAID for our reservations online months in advance and by time we checked in, they did not have the room we reserved. We were told because we booked them online, that did not guarantee us the room we had already paid for in advance. They told us to check back after the check out time the following day for a room change. Well, it's NYC on a weekend and surprise surprise, they were all sold out!!! So we were stuck in a very clean &quot;hole in the wall&quot; for the rest of our trip. The other trouble we seemed to have with them was every time we asked for directions or advice, No One seemed to help or the information they would give was wrong. So we decided to ask people on the streets or figure it out ourselves. I've never seen a staff so unknowlegable of the city THEY live in."
272,1749,"Jul 21 2004	Room with a ""View""	When i walked through the doors of the Hotel i thought yes not bad, the interior/decor was modern, the bar was very relaxed, everything seemed great until they gave me the dreaded room key, when i entered i laughed and thought they were having a joke, but when i realized this was no joke i could not believe my eyes. Its Tiny, the room had a brick wall with litter flying about as a view, it was badly lit, very dark &amp; dingy, my girlfriend couldn't even use her hair-dryer or straightners as this was too much power and the lights would go off. The shower was a complete joke as well, the water would go hot then cold, i felt that if i spent a long time in the room whist a wake i'd go insane, a Nightmare of a Room &amp; Hotel."
273,1749,"Jul 16 2004	DO NOT STAY HERE!	Our &quot;room&quot; was a closet! Very, very small, and old. The air conditioner in the window didn't work very well, the t.v. was on an old rickety t.v. cart and the room just smelled awful! The hallway to our room on the 2nd floor reeked of urine and was dark and dungeon like! We were supposed to have a room with 2 dble beds, but once we checked into the &quot;closet&quot; with 1 bed we were never moved the next day like they said! There isn't any room for 2 people to pass one another in the room.The bathroom wasn't too bad, much newer than the rest of the room. Our toilet backed up, however, they promptly fixed it. The ammenities in the hotel is a joke. They don't even have vending machines! The nicest thing about this hotel is the bar. Very nice decor and atmosphere! The hotel in general is in a great location for Time Square, David Letterman, Broadway shows and such. What's the old saying... YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!"
274,1749,"Jul 14 2004	A great way to visit new york	I grew up in NY and visit often and have stayed at the Amsterdam Court a number of times. This is a very well-run, small &quot;boutique hotel&quot; steps from Times Square, and major bus and all subway lines. The rooms are not large by American standards (and those with King size beds are cramped because the room size does NOT vary with bed size!). There are also rooms that face an interior &quot;air shaft&quot; BUT the quality of the service (there's a complimentary 'bagel' breakfast adjacent to the lobby every morning, coffee and tea brewing in this room around the clock and an extremely helpful and courteous staff) can't be beat. Plus you can tour the city, return to Time Square by cab, bus or train, shower and dress and walk 2 or 3 blocks to hundreds of restaurants and all of Broadway. The hotel was remodelled a few years ago and the motif is just as it is pictured in pictures on the internet: It's a blend of browns and tan in a modern motif that, in some minds look 'tired' in others look suave. If you want canary yellow, stay at the Holiday Inn. Stay here: you will love it!"
275,1749,"Jul 12 2004	No frills small but pleasant	We stayed here in early March- our first time sleeping in the big apple. We found the rooms to be tiny but very clean (with daily maid service) and the location couldnt be beat. We could see Radio City music hall as we stepped outside the hotel! Service was very friendly, including a great front desk manager who made sure I got back my back pack (which I'd left on the super shuttle!) Bagels for breakfast saved us the bother and expense of looking for breakfast every morning. The advertised cappucino machine, however, was &quot;out of order&quot;-- a big disappointment. Recommended if you arent going to spend a lot of time in the hotel."
276,1749,"Jun 21 2004	extremely rude staff	Hotel well placed for all the tourist spots and some excellent restaurants on Restaurant Row (8th and 48/49th street). But this is all it had to offer.Rooms were small - even by New York standards! Corridors were dark and dimly lit and in need of some re-decoration. Hotels offers a lift which is great as the stairs are very very steep! But the biggest let down was the attitude of the hotel staff. They were extremely rude and grossly unhelpful. Asked for some assistance with directions, venues etc. and Reception could barely manage an utterance. Very unpleasant and totally unnecessary. Would I return? Very unlikely!"
277,1749,Apr 9 2004	very cosy	I was very nervous on the way to the hotel after reading some of the reviews. From the moment we've arrived I was trying very hard to find some kind of faults and I must say that I have failed. I could not find one single problem with this hotel. The hotel staff was absolutly wanderful. My eight year old daughter and the houskeeper were even leaving little notes to each other which made my doughter's stay even more special. I thank you for that and all the staff that made our stay in New York very comfortable. Also the location was perfect. I would highly recommend this hotel.
278,1749,Apr 2 2004	Amsterdam Court Hotel	The Amsterdam Court Hotel was in a great location just a few blocks from time square and at a good price. The room were small with only 2 feet around the king bed. There was no room for your suitcase. If you want to be close to time square this is a good place to stay.
279,1749,Mar 6 2004	Great little hotel - value for money in the middle of NY	This is a good little hotel in the central of NY. Me and my partner went in Jan. 2003 when it was about -20c. Fairly clean however the decor is a little dull and worn out but it kept us really warm - actually a little too warm. We had to open the hotel window a little to get the right temperature. Nothing really too special about this hotel but then we were here to experience NY not the hotel. As long it was fairly clean and basic with a private bathroom - it was more than adequate for us. Would come to this hotel again but maybe not in the summer as we coudln't control the temperature in our room.
280,1749,"Feb 22 2004	Unbeatable Location at a Great Price- NYC	After booking my weekend trip to New York City for Valentine's Day weekend, I stumbled upon a number of reviews of the Amsterdam Court Hotel, where I was scheduled to stay. Most of these reviews were negative, and I was horrified for my upcoming trip.However, my experience with the Amsterdam Court Hotel could not have been better. The employees were extremely friendly and accomodating (including holding our bags for several hours after we checked-out), and the room was exactly how it was pictured on the hotel's website. The room was not huge, but it was large enough to hold a queen-sized bed, a desk, a television, and two small closets. The hotel was only a block from Times Square, and two blocks from Rockefeller Center.If I have the opportunity to visit the city again, I will definitely stay at this hotel. My recommendation for anyone who wants a central NYC location, and isn't looking to spend a fortune!"
281,1749,"Feb 19 2004	Second Time Round	Visited Amsterdam Court over 3 nights in February 2004. The Hotel is very much as the web site. Smallish but comfortable rooms, I found the beds very much to my liking. The bar area is decorated to a theme, very friendly and intimate with excellent staff. The reception staff were helpful with any information and any problems that occured with a good knowledge of the city. Our travelling companions had a minor accident, a torn shirt from a loose screw and the hotel immediately paid for a new shirt with no arguement. A booking error was rectified immediately with no hassel not always our experience in other Hotels.In terms of location, close to Time Square and several theatres, good transport links taxis and subway, a wide range of eating places delis and bars close by.Will return to this Hotel on my next visit to the Big Apple.One further comment about New York. Where are all these people who have a reputation for unhelpfulness and with a bad attitude?This is my second visit and I have not met one yet. I find New Yorkers very pleasant, extremely helpful with directions and information and a pleasure to talk to. In addition I feel very safe with the all the initiatives for safety Well done New York and keep up the good work.Will return in the near future"
282,1749,Feb 15 2004	Loved it	We loved it! Perfect for us. Fresh linens. Very clean. Small rooms but we didn't care we went to NEw York to see the city not sit in the hotel room. But when we did go back it was home for us. Awesome decor modern/ simplistic. Cool bar downstairs. and the front desk was very helpful and nice to us. It is out NEw hoem in NEw YOrk City. We loved it and kept saying it the whole time. We are a younger couple 22 and 23. two things only the windows did not lock and our phone wasn't working but we did not care because we were only in there for a little bit. Besides we were on the 7th floor. We will definitly return when we go back to new York.
283,1749,"Feb 4 2004	Good Price- Bad Hotel	We recently stayed here for one night. Chose this hotel because we were only in town for one night and it was close to Caroline's Comedy Club (where we were seeing a show). The room was a decent size in comparison to the last time we stayed here but that was pretty much the only thing the room had going for it. First off it was so hot we had to sleep with the bathroom window open, even after we turned off the radiator heat. Second, the toilet was situated so that you had to sit on it sideways. Also the room reeked of cigarette smoke- even though I smoke it was pretty rank. Doesn't do any good complaining- you're faced with front desk personnel that basically tell you &quot;Oh well&quot;. Would not stay here again even though the rates are good."
284,1749,"Jan 23 2004	""A MOUSE was crawling ON me!""	My brother and I decided to take a trip to NYC. I thought staying at this hotel would be ok because the reviews were not that bad. I had requested beforehand a room that was non-smoking since I cannot stand the smell. Well, when we got there, the room smelt like smoke. When I was sleeping, my brother woke me up to tell me A MOUSE WAS CRAWLING ON ME!!! It was on my shoulder and crawled down the rest of my body. I could not believe it. I immediately went to go to try to check out but it took forever to contact the manager for a refund. Finally I did. I admit it could have been worse, but if you don't like rodents crawling on you, don't stay here!!!!"
285,1749,"Jan 21 2004	Great Budget Hotel	My stay at the Amsterdam Court Hotel was all in all much better than I had thought considering me and my girlfriend paid very little!! Our room was really nice and a decent size and although there was a small problem with the lock on the door the staff fixed the problem in less than half an hour of us reporting the problem. The hotel is in an excellent position and is very tatsefully decorated. A new bar has has recently opened up downstairs which is really nice. The only downsize being that the drinks are fairly expensive. If you are young and are not planning on spending loads of time at your hotel then this is an excellent choice, I would certainly stay there again."
286,1749,"Nov 24 2003	Would stay there again	Had a small problem w/ the window not locking but it was quickly fixed. Small, yet clean and no bugs. Excellent location and price!!!"
287,1749,"Oct 21 2003	No Complaints geat deal	I stayed at the Amsterdam Court for my first visit to NYC in March 2003. The location can not be beat- just steps away from Times Square and the subway. Yes, the rooms are small, but clean, comfortable, and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable, and the only time we were really in the room was to sleep anyway, so the size of the room was not a issue. You're not going to find anything better on a budget. I wouldn't pay more than $125 a night, but if you get a good rate it's definitely worth it, and I'll more than likely stay there again. The service was fine, they kept our bags after checkout because our flight was in the evening. No complaints!"
288,1749,"Oct 13 2003	not what we expected	we had hope this hotel was worth the money we paid ,a friend of ours had stayed in times square and said not to worry as the competition is great the hotel should be ok , unfortunatly it was just the opposite it was dark,disaml ,the rooms were small inadequate lighting ,and the facilities offered were not there in the room and it had an awful smell .we complained and was offered another room wich was not much better only a little bigger ,stay away from this is you like light clean rooms."

1,1752,"Outstanding	This hotel was once an apartment building that has been converted into a hotel. We had a corner apt on the 19th floor. We felt like tru new yorkers! And, theres a restaurant on the 26th floor with terraces as well. It was just an awesome experience! Im definitely staying there again."
2,1752,"Friendly staff	I haven't stayed at the Beekman for awhile, but decided to give it a try again because it had such a reasonable rate. The staff were so helpful and polite, along with the maids and doormen also. Nice quiet side of town. I was wondering why the adjoining restaurant had closed, which was a nice plus. We did take advantage of the complimentary breakfast at the Top of the Tower which was fabulous overlooking the East River. Will definitely return."
3,1752,"Nov 25 2009 	Brilliant location lovely hotel	Stayed here in Oct 09 for 4 nights. We were given a junior suite which included fridge,cooker and microwave. The room was lovely, decor just fine. The location was excellent, only 8 mins on foot to Rockafella center. Small restaurant and cornor shop directly across the street for all you may need. The restaurant on the top floor has beautiful views, we ate there one night, food prices similar to home prices, drinks were little pricey. Discovered since it is owned by Anglo Irish bank, but is run better than the bank so no worries there..."
4,1752,"Nov 24 2009 	Satisfied traveler... hope to return	I booked The Beekman hotel after much searching and agonizing over price versus value.I booked thru Travelocity and got a fantastic deal. On my way to the hotel, I phoned The Beekman to ensure that my reservation had been completed by Travelocity. The hotel informed me that Travelocity had, in fact, NOT made my reservation! BUT, the hotel assured me that... although Travelocity was unable to complete even the most basic of functions, The Beekman would look after my family and make sure we were taken care of. Well, I finally got Travelocity to complete the reservation and The Beekman called me less than 30 seconds later to let me know I was all set.When we arrived, 2 hours early, the hotel front desk (Michael) told me our room was ready and we could check in immediately. (WOW).The room was spacious and clean as a whistle (why do people use that phrase? Are whistles REALLY the standard of clean?)The carpet and furnishings were outdated and worn... but certainly not unclean or unusable. For the price we paid, we would stay there again tomorrow. The doorman (John... you the man), was friendly and helpful. He gave us alot of great advice on where to eat and how to get around. The room had an incredible view. We NEVER saw any type of vermin as has been accused here by others. We felt completely safe and the bed was ABSOLUTELY comfortable!Overall, a good experience in a comfortable room. We look forward to returning."
5,1752,"Nov 17 2009 	Sliding Downhill Rapidly	My wife and I have stayed at the Beekman quite a few times over the past five or six years. We were happy to trade the location and room size for the shabby decor and tired carpets. However, the last two times this year has convinced us to give up on the place. We were told that the hotel does not provide room heating unless the outdoor temperature is under 50 F (sounds like tenement rules to me). The doormen were never at the door and if they ever appeared, it was outside smoking. Our in-room tea alowance was one teabag and three packets of sugar daily. The trash bins were not emptied daily and the rest of housekeeping service was prefunctory. A guest left their room service tray and dishes next to the elevator door and IT STAYED THERE FOR TWO DAYS!!"
6,1752,"Oct 27 2009 	Tired but spacious	My friend and I booked this hotel through Thomas Cook. We wanted a twin room with a kitchen and the Beekman Tower provided just that. However, I should mention that although we &quot;requested&quot; a twin room, it was just that - a request and it wasn't until my friend phoned the hotel direct as soon as we'd made the reservation that they ensured that we had a twin room. They only have three twin suites according to the receptionist so if you have a specific request it's worth phoning and confirming.When we got there the receptionist had our twin booking and our original booking - which turned out to be a queen suite. He cancelled this and left us with the twin booking without any fuss.Our room wasn't ready at 3pm but they stowed our luggage and we went for a quick walk and the room was ready at 3.30pm.The suite (3L) was large and until the air conditioning was switched on, right at the end of our holiday, it was very quiet. The aircon/heating in the room works very well indeed. It was the aircon outside the lounge window that was an issue. However, we got used to it pretty quickly and we weren't in the room very much. The bedroom is at the front of the hotel which was very quiet.As other guests have mentioned, the furniture and carpet are very tired but I'm rather glad that this was the case since it meant that the space was affordable. Had it been more newly furnished it may have been out of our price bracket as it's location was excellent. This part of town is very quiet but still close to the Empire State Building (easily walkable) etc. Our room was perfectly clean."
7,1752,"Oct 19 2009 	Poor old Beekman	We've stayed at the Beekman many times over the years and have always overlooked its air of shabbiness because we liked the size of the rooms and the genteel feel of the hotel; it's always reminded us of a big but unfancy New York apartment. But our three-night stay in room 11D has persuaded us to give up on the tired old Beekman after all these years. We've never seen hotel furniture in such bad condition, scratched and scraped and looking as if it was found in a thrift shop. (That's no exaggeration.) The Beekman's carpet has always been a little threadbare, but in this room it was ripped and stained and at least 10 years past replacement. The bathroom blinds were bent and twisted as if someone had tried to rip them down. And the bathroom itself was frightening -- a moldy shower curtain, a toilet seat that was the wrong shape for the toilet, and grunge everywhere we looked. While the front desk folks were fine, the housekeeping was hit and miss. (Why clean someplace that will still look dirty when you're done?) All this for nearly $300 a night. It's a shame. The Beekman is a wonderful building in a good location, but until the owner, the Luxe Group, invests in critically needed renovations we won't be going back. It's a shame."
8,1752,"Oct 5 2009 	Shabby tired and overpriced	This hotel cost $300 per night and I would have expected more for that price. I can see that it has a certain Art Deco charm but my room looked as though it hadn't been decorated since the early part of the 20th century. Dark and dingy room, old and shabby furniture, sticky carpets, cracked tiles, cobwebs. On the plus side it was a large room (more like a mini-apartment really with separate double bedroom, small kitchen and a living room with dining room table, sofa (with pull out bed) and TV. Bizarrely the so-called 'fully equipped' kitchen had a full-size gas cooker with oven and grill but no pots and pans or any other cooking utensils. There was , however, a fridge and a microwave so I managed to microwave mugs of water to make tea! A toaster and coffee machine were also supplied.For a hotel marketed at business visitors I was surprised that there was no in-room internet access. There was a business center on the second floor where you had to pay 30 cents a minute to use the internet.There was a fairly well-equiped gym and an over-priced restaurant on the 26th Floor (maybe worth it for a drink to admire the views but make sure you eat elsewhere)."
9,1752,"Oct 2 2009 	Do not stay at the Beekman unless you like mice and rats in your room!	I stayed at the Beekman Tower between 19 and 26 Sept. 09 and had the most horrible hotel experience ever. In my first room on the 4th floor, rats ate up my gift chocolates. Mice could not have caused such havoc. In the second room on the 8th floor, the bath tub drained so poorly that I took my showers standing in a pool of stagnant soapy water. One night as I was reading in bed, I saw two mice running around the bedroom floor. In the third room on 16th floor, the toilet ran constantly, the rock hard bed was missing a top mattress and there was no blanket. I moved to another hotel before running into mice, which I'm sure would have appeared before long. In addition, one morning there was not one drop if running water in the hotel. When I checked out, the hotel placed my credit card on hold and didn't release it until four days later. Thank goodness I carried another card with me. The hotel also tried to charge me for no-show for one night's accommodation on my additional reservation, which would have started the day I checked out.The hotel's response to all of this was the usual &quot;I'm sorry&quot;. There was never a manager available. To their credit, the bath tub was fixed in a couple of days, free breakfast vouchers were offered as a compensation for the rats and the lack of water. After several reminders I got 20$ compensation for the chocolates and after demanding compensation for yet another room infested with mice, one night's accommodation charges were waived. Still, considering that a room charge for that particular week was 500$/night and that I had to change rooms (=pack &amp; unpack) several times with no help from the hotel staff, the compensation was clearly unsatisfactory. In a nutshell: the hotel is currently infested with mice and rats. Plumbing is a problem and the overall shabbiness makes the hotel substandard. The Beekman used to be a cosy hotel with a perfect location for business travellers. No more. It is sad to see the decay. For 500$ a night - even in New York City - travellers have the right to expect a whole lot more."
10,1752,"Sep 21 2009 	Good low cost option in Midtown Manhattan	This hotel is situated on the intersection of 51 St. and 1st Av. in Midtown Manhattan. Although this is not quite in the centre of Manhattan it is placed relatively close to some of the main attractions New York has to offer including; the UN headquarters, grand central station, empire state building and 5th Av. These attractions are around a 20 minute walk away. The nearest subway station (number 6 on the green line) is a 10 minute walk away meaning that it is often quicker to walk than to take the subway. For those willing to do some walking whilst in New York this is hotel offers a good compromise between cost and location. For those slightly older and unable to walk too far this is probably not the best hotel for you.In terms of the room, ours was very clean and relatively large for the price. We paid around 90 ($150) a night and we had our own kitchen with breakfast stalls, sofa, queen-sized bed and en-suite bathroom. Although the decor is slightly outdated nothing was damaged or broken. The staff were friendly and helpful. They even gave us free Wifi for the duration of our stay, although it is usually $10 per night. The internet was very fast and reliable. All in all, for a 3 star hotel, this hotel offers good value for money. Apart from the proximity to the subway there is very little to grumble about. If you're on a budget and wish to save a significant sum of money when compared to hotels very close to 5th Av and Times Square then this may be the place for you."
11,1752,"Sep 19 2009 	Beware of their annex rooms they are dirty noisey and carpeting is shabby.	I have stayed at the Beekman approx. 10 times during the last 5 years. All the previous (9) stays were in their main building and were okay --- clean, quiet, nice rooms for the money charged. However, for this last visit of 3 nights in August I reserved a room using Travelocity's website. The price was a lot cheaper than the Beekman's own website ... and now I know why -- the hotel placed me in their next-door annex. It should really be called the house of horrors. The room was a nightmare. The carpeting was so threadbare that I actually cut (ie. bleeding and needing a bandage and hydrogen peroxide) the bottom of my foot on the carpet tack strip that came through the carpeting at the entrance to the bathroom. The room was dirty, the carpeing filthy, and it was extremely noisey both from the street traffic and especially from the cheap airconditioner unit stuck through the wall, If that weren't bad enough, their elevator kept dinging all night long -- the walls were so thin that this noise echoed through the room. After the first night of 3, I purchased a pair of earplugs at the nearby Dwane Reade. If you were wondering, why I did not change rooms --- I did try. However, they claimed they were all booked. I am sure that the rate thru Travelocity is really the reason why they refused to change the rooms. Also, the 3 nights were prepaid, non-refundable and since I was by myself and have stayed in worse places (small villages in Tibet, Mexico and Costa Rica) I just remained there rather than waste the last 2 nights prepayment. So a warning to the wise traveler --- the Beekman might seem like a good deal and most of the time in the main building it is --- but they have a lot of junk in their room inventory that could ruin your vacation. If the purpose of your visit is pleasure rather than business, be very very careful with this hotel."
12,1752,Sep 16 2009 	Wonderful place to stay	This was our second year to visit New York and also our second time to stay at the Beekman Tower. The location is great. Just down the street from the UN and only a short distance from the Theater District. The transit authority has a bus stop just across the street from the front door. The staff was wonderful. Rooms were always clean. One note..this is not a new hotel and don't expect that.
13,1752,"Sep 13 2009 	Huige suites but somewhat outdated	The hotel offers huge suites, nice staff and fairly clean rooms. The hotel is somewhat old and the good things come at a price."
14,1752,"Sep 8 2009 	Spacious Suites - good location and very quiet	We stayed in a on one bedroom queen standard suite. Our room was on the 22nd floor and had a great view. The room was clean and spacious. It had a fully equipped kitchen, living area with table and pull-out sofa, and nice master bedroom/comfortable bed. The bathroom had beautiful marble tile. This was a good location, clean , and quiet - walking distance to Grand Central Terminal. The only recommendation on the pull-out sofa ( and this is true with most pull-out sofas ) - this sleeps one person and would bring a egg crate topper/foam mattress for comfort. Also, bring an air mattress/extra bedding for other teen age children."
15,1752,"Sep 5 2009 	Dated hotel needs upgrading	The proximity of the Beekman Tower Hotel to Grand Central, combined with a decent deal through a travel website, led us here for 2 nights in Sept 2008. The neighborhood is nice enough and removed from the hustle and bustle just a few subway stops away. The hotel itself seems that it was once a place of grandeur but has not been well maintained. The lobby and our room were both in need of upgrades and the general feel of the hotel was somewhat depressing. Our room was small and not as clean as we expected it to be which was unsettling because we're willing to overlook a lot. It is unlikely we would stay here again."
16,1752,"Aug 26 2009 	Friendly great value and convenience!	We stayed at the Beekman one weekend. The staff are friendly and helpful. The other guests we met were also friendly. Some had returned to this hotel many times, we learned. The room was roomy, and the kitchenette had everything we needed to cook a nice brunch. There was a grocery right across the street. Yes, some of the furniture and rugs could be updated, but this was a trivial matter."
17,1752,"Aug 23 2009	Most enjoyable stay	I stayed with my brother the last couple of days of july first week of augusthad the most enjoyable time, we got a suite on the 4th floor, with out own kitchen , equipped with fridge, coffeemaker, microwave, oven, cooker, dishwasher, we wanted for nothing, each day our cleaners would leave us heaps of coffee, and tea etc, we left a dollar each for them every morning on the table in living room, we stayed a week and had no problems at all, only thing i found bad was cost of internet, if u have your own laptop you have to pay a charge for room every night, but if you go to conference room it is 10 dollars for half an hour,fitness room is well enough equipped for a basic workout, and the staff are friendly, they sent us back to airport in a stretch limo haha.but if you want a good stay in a nice decently priced hotel then stay here, 24 hr shop across the road that has everything you need, and a greek restaurant beside that with cheap tasty food, i will stay here again"
18,1752,"Aug 10 2009 	Unsafe. Do not stay here.	This hotel is a safety risk and is seedy. After checking in, I noticed the hotel door locks were broken, screws were stripped. Needless to say, we did not feel safe -- we did not stay the night. Unless you feel like sitting by the door all night waiting for intruders, do not stay here. Mascara and strange-looking hairs covered the bed. The management did not offer us a refund, instead literally blaming us for not contacting the hotel engineer at 9pm to fix whatever issues there were. How it is our fault that the hotel was not safe is beyond me. We stayed elsewhere, and had to eat the cost of booking at the Beekman.I am an easy-to-please traveler, and this is the first time that I have even written a review, because I think that other travelers should absolutely find somewhere else to stay in NYC when visiting. You may get lucky and have an enjoyable stay, but you may also have a stay like ours, with safety issues and unhelpful management."
19,1752,"Jul 27 2009 	Good Hotel Good Location for your Money	Just came back From New York City Manhattan with my husband and 2 kids 11 and 12. We stay at the Beekman Hotel in a Queen Suite. The rooms were very spacious, Kitchen with 4 eye burner, microwave, fridge and dishwasher. Included in the room is a dining room table, pull out couch, TV, A/C in the living and separate Bedroom. The hotel help was great, polite and answered out questions. I talked to one employee thats been working at the same hotel fro 20yrs and loves it. They have a restaurant at the top floor and a fitness centre on the 2nd floor. Location is on 1st Ave about 6 blocks from Broadway its a good walk, we did a few times but also used the subway or taxis. I would suggest the hop on hop off tour bus, it educational and we could get off at any location were the tour bus stopped and get back on (buses run every 10-15 min). The Tour bus stops 5 min walk from the hotel. New York is very expensive, anything on Broadway is very costly, if you want to eat, got past 9th Ave, it gets less expensive. I would stay at this hotel for the convenience of having a kitchen in our room and the price and service was good."
20,1752,"Jul 26 2009 	Lost its luster	I frequented this hotel in the 1990s. It was a jewel in midtown, part of Manhattan East Suite Hotels group. I decided to go back to it last week. What a disappointment! What used to be great is now gloomy and drab. Surely, the rooms are still large and many come with the convenience of a separate seating room and kitchen, but no space large enough, not even in Manhattan, can compensate for a dingy room that has not seen a decent upkeep in what seems like ages. The carpet is stained, sofas are now covered with cheap sofa-covers from the dollar store, the bathroom in desperate need of bleach! Courtains stained and torn. The Top-of-the-Tower signature restaurant has also decayed. Breakfast buffet is reduced. A complete letdown. Not a place to have a good stay, not anymore, unless a total renovation is planned for the future. What a pity. I had great memories from this place and the location is truly marvelous. Shame on the current owners.P.S. The food tray that was left by the elevator when I checked in, was still uncollected the day I checked out. Three days later! That should tell you something... stay away."
21,1752,"Jul 22 2009 	Beekman your hayday is over.	$724 for 3 nights in NYC and the hotel has a mouse! This hotel was rated a 3 star. I booked for 3 people, and got a room with one small double bed and a pullout couch. The pullout couch was in such bad condition that you could not sleep with it pulled out. The couch folded up was not much better. After I booked i saw reviews online about this hotel which stated that the hotel was dirty and there a few comments about mice. I called up hotwire right away and the hotwire associate was unbelievably out of line. I told him about the reviews, letting him know that perhaps the condition of the hotel was not the same as it was when hotwire first partnered with the hotel or gave it its star rating. When I mentioned the mouse he told me &quot;Look I have watched 20/20 and I know all about how everywhere has mice.&quot; How can it be acceptable to have a 3 star hotel with mice. This hotel would probably have been great 30-40 years ago in its art deco glory. But there has clearly not been any renovations or upgrades in at least 15 years. I cannot fault the hotel, since with any quick search of the hotel your know what you are getting your self into, the reviews don't lie. I can only fault hotwire.They claim that you will have a hotel with a specific rating, and that it will be comparable to reputable named hotels. This did not live up to the hotwire description. Booking with hotwire leaves you helpless. You have NO power at the hotel to complain about the conditions since you have already paid. This hot is old, do not expect frills. The carpets are weathered and worn, the couches are uncomfortable, the beds are hard. This hotel is also loud. First room was 2H this faces 1st AVE, loud street noise. Then we were switched to 5AII, this room had less street noise but the toilet would run constantly. I would say if you are looking to book a hotel do not book here, I am sure you can find something better. the trip in from Jersey would be well worth it! But if you were like me and booked through Hotwire and did not choose this hotel, but are stuck with it, I saw just be prepared. I made my self sick after reading reviews, hoping they were not true, but fearing they probably were. My tips would be:Do NOT bring ANY food into the room so the mice won't stick around. Keep your luggage zipped up even if its on a table, the mouse in our room was on teh table!Bring ear plugs.Ask to switch rooms, some will be better than others. The restaurant is nice, and they give out free breakfast vouchers to solve all problems so take advantage of that.Good luck and sorry if anyone else gets roped into this hotel by hotwire. I will say that the Beekman staff overall were nice, and really this hotel is just bad so if you book there it is what it is so to some degree i Do not fault the beekman staff. The star rating should for sure be downgraded though."
22,1752,"Jul 13 2009 	Good hotel	The price of the hotel is quite OK for New York. The room is a mini suite wit kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom. We had an issue with the toilets but they fixed it quickly. They have a private parking, which is good for NY but it does cost 42$ per day.Very close from the ONU and quite close from 5th avenue and Central Park (if you do not mind walking a bit). To go to Statue of Liberty better take the subway tho."
23,1752,"Jun 18 2009 	Great midtown east location	Transportation (bus) on the corner, taxis usually out front. Small lobby and front desk with friendly staff. Three elevator banks for quick service. Top floor bar and restaurant open for breakfast and dinner - great all around view! Guest laundry coin operated in basement; fitness and business center on 2nd floor accessible with electronic room key (card) only. Wireless internet in rooms for $9.95 per day. Kitchenette with adequate plates, silverware and glasses ; coffee maker and microwave. Triple sheeted beds a nice touch."
24,1752,"Jun 17 2009 	good experience	Clean room, good location, great kitchen area with refrigerator no noise problem. Felt we had a great value in safe area close to everything. Nice staff. No complaints"
25,1752,"Jun 8 2009 	A fantastic mini-apartment for the money!	We booked this hotel at a discount site, looking for a place in Manhattan with kitchen facilities (hate having to go out for breakfast). We read some reviews stating how run-down or disappointing this hotel is. We were prepared for the worst, having been very disappointed in our last hotel (in London). When we arrived, the check-in staff were very helpful and we were quickly in our room. We were very pleased with the huge room we were given (at least 18m2 plus bathroom) with a King bed, table for 2, a small desk/console, an easy chair and the promised kitchen facilities. We were thrilled to have windows that opened, as we find the relentless climate control of many hotels difficult to cope with.I can identify a few limitations to this hotel: no complimentary broad-band; very limited kitchen utensils; carpet that had seen better days 10 years ago; quite a bit of noise on the lower floors, as we had a room on the 2nd floor. A little spent on this hotel would bring it up to an excellent standard.Overall, this hotel is to be highly recommended, when price is included in the equation. If you want glitz, go elsewhere; it you want excellent value, the Beekman Tower is a place to book."
26,1752,"Jun 8 2009 	Tired and depressing. Beekman owners: sort it out!	We last stayed in the Beekman two years ago. It was a bit run-down in places, but the room was good and clean and we had a fuss-free stay. We were very pleased to be returning, and were excited when we arrived. That feeling quickly evaporated. The room we were given was really shabby and tired. It's possible it hadn't been occupied in a while, and it hadn't been vacuumed properly. Worst of all, while in the kitchenette, I noticed that there were mouse droppings. I couldn't work out what I was more annoyed by - that there were mice in the first place, or the fact that they hadn't bothered to hide the fact by cleaning up the mess!Unfortunately, the hotel was full that night and we couldn't be moved. To the credit of the desk staff, they offered us gratis drinks in the bar at the top of the hotel and moved us the following day, to a room three floors below. The new room was clean and tidy - no mice droppings - but also looked like it had seen better days. The communal areas (apart from the brand new business centre) all needed a lick of paint and new carpets.In the past I've recommended this hotel, but I won't in future. This could be a great hotel: it's in a good location and it has very caring staff (especially desk staff and doormen), but at the moment it's totally letting itself down. I urge you, Affinia Hotels, spend some money on this place and sort it out."
27,1752,"Jun 3 2009 	very good value for money and great location	We have been in this hotel for a week in May09. This was our second trip to NYC. Last year we stayed in New Jersey and transfer was a nightmare, so this location made a huge difference. It takes about 10-15 min to walk to Rockefeller Centre, if you take a bus at 49th St., you will get to Times Sq. in a couple of minutes. First night we got an upgrade to apartment which had kitchen, bedroom, living room and a bathroom. The rest of the week we had standard room which we originally booked and the only difference was that the bedroom was combined with living room area, but it still had sofa and separate kitchen with breakfast table. For some reason I found the standard room much nicer than the apartment, not sure if it was refurbished, because the furniture was a little used but I felt comfortable in this room. The room was clean, the only problem was the bed, it was quite narrow for me and my partner. Otherwise the room is very good value for money, because it is apartmentlike with very good location and also cheaper then most of the hotels in this area. Also a must is a bar/restaurant on the top of the hotel, very nice view. I can recomend a very good japanese restaurant YAMA on East 49th Street, they make the best pork dish we have ever had (I forgot the name but i think it was the only one in the menu). Also there is a diner called Nations Cafe right across the street from the hotel where they make really good pancakes."
28,1752,"Jun 2 2009 	Great Location	I was there for a conference in the UN. This was a minute's walk away from the UN building. It has amazing rooms. They're massive. you have a living room, a kitchen, a bedroom and an ironing room. Its a whole apartment. 15 minutes walk to the times square. The view from the top of the tower is amazing. There is a nice cafe in front of the hotel which satisfies all your cuisine desires. I proffered picking up some stuff from the Gourmet store across the road and cooking myself. Its highly recommended if you're traveling with your kids or with your family. The television has a great set of movies. You can get here from JFK at exactly 45 dollars in the Yellow cabs, fixed rate. Do not get into the cabs which are not the yellow ones. They charge you double the price. These drivers come upto you the moment you leave the airport and offer you taxis. The hotel provided me with a limousine for my departure to JFK for a mere 60 dollars."
29,1752,"May 22 2009 	Worst Mattress I Ever (Tried to) Sleep On	This is supposed to be a 3 1/2 star hotel, but the bed in my room would have embarrassed a zero star hotel. Also, the overnight temperature in New York City on the night of my stay was in the high 30's, even though this was in May, and there was no heat in the room. I spent an uncomfortable night."
30,1752,"May 14 2009 	Reasonable Suites in a wonderful Art Deco building	The location is great if you are visiting the United Nations, otherwise it's a bit of a hike to the subways on Lexington Avenue, Overall though it's a great value. I was expecting a small room with a bath for the price I paid. What I got was a full suite with a large living space, a bedroom, two closets, bathroom, and a kitchen stocked with refrigerator, four-burner stove, toaster, utensils, and dinnerware.The place is kept very clean, My room was cleaned promptly every morning and by a helpful and friendly staff. The doorman was especially good at arranging transportation efficiently.If this hotel were on Fifth Avenue, it would charge twice or three times its current rates! It's a very nice experience in a &quot;residential&quot; part of Manhattan. (At least there are lots of trees on the Streets in the area and some good restaurants.)"
31,1752,"May 6 2009 	unbeatable value for money	We loved the Beekman Tower and consider it the best value for money that we have had for anything while in Manhattan: for just over US$ 200 including taxes per night, we were given a complete apartment including full bathroom and kitchen, dining, living and separate bedroom. In a city where most people seem to live in a matchbox, we could almost dance around the rooms, did not suffer any noise from within the hotel, were able to make our own breakfast (or any other meal for that matter), could easily do separate programs with the one sleeping in the bedroom and the other watching TV in the living and all this at a privileged geographical location. The only thing we felt might be improved is the front desk service level: it is curious how many people in NYC seem to be in too much of a hurry or too preoccupied with something else to properly execute what they are supposed to be doing. Still, this was a minor nuisance compared to all the upsides. No surprises then that the Beekman was fully booked for the second part of our stay and we had to resort to another hotel that came nowhere near to offering the same quality for the same money. Highly recommended, would definitely stay there again."
32,1752,"Apr 7 2009 	Loved this hotel	From the moment I arrived to receive excellent and friendly service at the front desk to the moment I left in a hotel-booked car to the airport, everything about the Beekman was great. I was upgraded to a suite with a good view and was really happy to see that what felt like a Manhattan apartment would be my home base for the next week. My room was quiet, the bed was very comfortable and the cleaning staff did a great job. This was my first trip to NYC and the Beekman was an integral part of what was a wonderful experience. I have and will continue to recommend it unreservedly!"
33,1752,"Mar 23 2009 	Spacious Room but Don't Try to Sleep In - It's Noisy!	Booked with Travelzoo special. Stayed here 1 night during the week. Was walking distance to Grand Central Station, but off the beaten path and near the UN building. Placed in a the shorter of the two buildings (not the main tower). Was difficult to roll two (2) luggage bags and carry other bags and open the elevator door. The elevator is fast and reliable. The room used radiator heat. The stay was dry and hot because we were unable to control the heat. We had to request for an ironing board, but the staff was very prompt and friendly. The rooms are spacious and are condo/studio style. The traffic noise is uncontrollable, beware if you want to sleep in!Overall, good to great experience. Would recommend to family and friends."
34,1752,"Feb 28 2009 	Doesn't deserve the star rating 8 blocks from Times Square	Booked this hotel from Amex.com, it said this hotel is 3.5 stars. Comparing this to other 3.5 stars, it doesnt match the standard. The kitchen was clean, however the bedroom was not satisfactory. Bed was not in great condition. The bathroom was too cramped. Top of the tower restaurant didnt accomodate walk-in even though there were 8-10 empty tables."
35,1752,"Feb 25 2009 	Decent Hotel	Stayed here for four nights In a superior suite.The room was good, spacious and very clean. Maid service daily with towel change.Staff were friendly and helpful.Location was a bit far out but in some respects wasn't a bad thing, 15/20 minutes walk to main areas at most. Was good after an evening meal as you had the chance to walk It off!!! All in all, a good hotel and worth looking at as an option."
36,1752,"Feb 1 2009 	Great staff large rooms but dirty and outdated!	Room was big and spacious for NYC. Location was &quot;off the beaten path&quot; 40th and 1st ave. The rooms were very dated, they need an update. The light switches were disgusting dirty filled with crud! Heater was noisy. The one thing positive was the staff was great!"
37,1752,"Jan 22 2009 	Fantastic non-expensive hotel in Manhattan	We were amazed by the size of room we got, which was a full suite and for ~$160 a night!Other than that the room was very clean though not very new, had 2 TVs with enough channels to fall asleep to and hotel staff was usually very helpful.The location is somewhat at a quiet location in Manhattan but for the price we got it it was great.The hotel's roof top restaurant was less of an experience and very expensive.Highly recommended and we would definitely go back there when looking to pay less in Manhattan."
38,1752,"Jan 20 2009 	Argentinos en NY	I was in NY in an excellent trip. Except our stay in Beekman, everything was great. However, the hotel(is very well located), leaves much to develop. The first day, my son was locked in the bathroom, because it locks the door (a bad screw in doorknob). The second day, the bathroom was flooded and part of the room with WC water. The same thing happened on the third day. The hotel staff is very nice, but except to apologize, I did not receive any manifestation of the hotel soon felt the inconvenience caused."
39,1752,"Jan 17 2009 	Beekman-A Quirky Gem	The Beekman is an excellent choice at this price range in NYC. The rooms are large, although the furnishings are a bit dated. The bathrooms are in need of updating, yet clean. But again...given the price I usually pay for a room at the Beekman, its definitely a good deal. The hotel is pet-friendly, and the neighborhood seemed quite safe for a late night walk. There's a nice deli across the street that delivers."
40,1752,"Jan 15 2009 	ROOMY CLEAN and CONVENIENT!!!	My family of four booked a 6-night stay at the Beekman Towers for December 26-January1. We loved our suite on the 22nd floor. We had a small kitchen (included coffee-maker, toaster, microwave, dishwasher, sink, oven and cooktop); a nice size den with a sofa that made into a bed; and a nice size bedroom with a queen bed. The bathroom was very nice and clean, and nice soaps and bath gels, shampoos, etc. were left for us each day. We had ample closet space and storage space for our clothes. Two TVs--both had excellent reception. We had a nice terrace with a nice view. We asked for a roll-away bed, and although it was not all that comfortable, it was fine for our 11-year-old daughter. Maid service was excellent. People at front desk were nice. Doorman was really friendly. Elevator service was ALWAYS good. I loved being across the street from the small, 24-hour &quot;mart.&quot; They had good bagels, and we stocked up on OJ, cereal, milk and bananas so we could eat breakfast in. The Beekman provided coffee packs we could brew ourselves. A lot cheaper than going out. There was a diner across from the United Nations--had a wonderful selection of food and prices were reasonable. We enjoyed the walk to Rockefeller Center, Bryant Park and Grand Central Station. We even walked as far as Times Square several times. Although some might prefer to stay in the midst of the hustle and bustle, this place was definitely NOT in the thick of the hustle and bustle. I liked that aspect of the Beekman and I would definitely go back to this hotel."
41,1752,"Jan 5 2009 	Fair Enough	Another trip back to the city, another city hotel review. We got a good rate through priceline and decided it was worth it, especially given the fact that we were just in for a quick New Year's weekend visit, and had a feeling the city would have been filled with tourists abound. Our room wasn't ready upon check-in so we left our bag with the doorman. Initial impression of the lobby was nice, nothing overly fancy, but nice enough. Odd though that there were no restrooms in the lobby area and was given the key to the 2nd floor fitness center to use the bathroom there. Just be sure to knock before entering as the bathrooms are equipped with a shower as well and people REALLY do make use of it after a work out (I was lucky enough to discover that).When we got to our room later in the day, it made a nice first impression. Spacious enough and clean. And yes, while the hotel may be a bit older and their furnishings aren't sleek and new, it made a great place to flop for the night.It was a quick walk from Grand Central Station to the hotel and located in a nice, quiet part of town. Getting a cab was no trouble and we found the location to be convenient to major city attractions.The only complaint I have is that upon check-out the woman at the front desk informed us that there were 2 phone charges from our hotel room, a long distance call and a local call. They were made at times when we weren't even in the hotel room. She reversed the charge, so we'll see if that actually goes through on the next credit card statement. Hopefully no one snuck in while we were out and placed the calls. That would then be a whole different hotel review."
42,1752,"Dec 23 2008 	Good value for Manhattan	Given the exhorbitant cost of staying in central Manhattan, the Beekman offers great value for money and if your expectations are realistic, you shouldn't be disappointed.Other reviews that mention tired decor and furniture are certainly correct, but we couldn't fault the cleanliness of the bathroom/linen or the helpfulness of the staff. I'm not sure I agree that the hotel's soundproofing is second to none, but then again we were on the street side which I suspect is noisier than if you are in a room at the back.Excellent diners nearby and we found a few nice restaurants on 2nd Avenue. The bar at the top of the Beekman is also pleasant.Overall a good value place to stay, but you do need to sacrifice the glitz to get it."
43,1752,"Dec 14 2008 	beware of low rates	We were excited to have secured a good rate ($200) for a night here. We were told when we got there that there was no room available for an early check-in, so we had to use the &quot;health club&quot; bathrooms to change into clothes for a wedding. But we were told that all was ready for our check-in; the front desk staff even showed us a packet of our registration materials all ready to go. So imagine our surprise when we returned after the wedding and were told that the hotel was full and they were sending us to another hotel. That hotel was decent but certainly not the quality we expected. Perhaps I'm suspicious, but it seems clear that we were shuffled off because we had a lower rate agreement than someone else. From what we did see of the hotel, it was fairly dingy. I wonder if this is something hotels make a practice of when they find that they can do better than an agreed-upon rate."
44,1752,"Dec 10 2008 	Hotel from Hell	Beekman Tower Hotel New York11 People stayed at this Hotel from the 2 Dec till the 7 Dec 2008.We were split into two 4s and a 3. The room we were allocated was 1 bedroomed, with a bed settee in the living area. We were expected to sleep together. When we asked for extra beds we were told we would have to pay another 30 Dollars a night each or if we wanted to upgrade to another room it would be 70 Dollars a night. The 3 people had a room with 2 toilets and it was much larger, they didnt have to pay extra. There was only enough toiletries for 1 person, not enough towels or blankets. It was a dark dingy hole. It was miles from anywhere, Had to take taxis all the time, too far to walk, coming back it was hard to get a taxi. Decided to have breakfast the last morning it took 1 hour before we were even served, when the food came it was cold, took it away and put in microwave still cold, it cost us 20 dollars plus tip. A complete rip off. The safe in the room didnt work, the key was lost, they didnt replace it carried all out money with us.I would never recommend this Hotel to anyone."
45,1752,Dec 7 2008 	Shabby infested	Within ten minutes of arrival I was approached by a mouse in my room. The mouse was quite bold and obviously comfortable in its surroundings. The first room phone I picked up to notify the front desk staff did not work. The hotel staff relocated me to a different floor which allowed smoking even though I purchased a nonsmoking room. The room service breakfast was not as ordered. I paid nearly $900 to stay in the Beekman Tower for two nights--far more than I should have. Had it been a refundable fare I would have relocated to another hotel. It is definitely not worth the price.
46,1752,"Dec 6 2008 	Exceeded expectations	I was pleasantly surprised by my studio suite at the Beekman Towers. Although usually rated at three stars, it was still a very comfortable hotel. The rooms are very clean and spacious. Yes, they are a bit dated and worn, so if that is a problem, you should look elsewhere. The queen bed was quite comfortable and the sheets were reasonably new. I did not try the pull out bed. Having a kitchenette was very convenient. The staff were warm and friendly. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but the view from its rooftop location is wonderful. The United Nations Cafe across the street is a good place to go for breakfast. The hotel was not close to the subway, so we took cabs a lot. The neighborhood is worth wandering around. Just to the north there are many consulates and we found Irving Berlin's house just a couple of blocks from the hotel. I would definitely stay at his hotel again."
47,1752,"Nov 30 2008 	Large suites helpful staff clean but worn	We booked a deluxe king suite for $279.00 a night for Thanksgiving weekend. Our suite had a large living room/dining area, a small separate kitchen with a gas stove, microwave, coffee maker full fridge, utensils, etc. There were 1-1/2 baths, one with a tub and shower head. The shower was great! Everything was clean but the furniture was worn and scratched. The sofa had a slipcover on it that kept coming off and exposed the slightly stained upholstery. We had a king bed which was very comfortable and our daughter slept on a roll-away bed that we requested ahead of time. We didn't try the pull out sofa bed because we've never slept on one that was even slightly comfortable. The restaurant, called Top of the Tower, was very elegant and and romantic . A pianist was playing on a grand piano and it was dark with candles and soft lighting. The view was stunning. Unfortunately we didn't eat there because we had only brought casual clothing. Room service is available. The staff and the doormen were very accommodating and were always available to help. Valet parking was $52.00 a day and you weren't able to access your auto until check-out. That was fine with us because we mostly walked or took taxis. A parking garage down the street was only $2.00 less per day. The neighborhood is mostly residential and very quiet and safe. We had a view from the bedroom of the East River which was nice. One block west on 2nd Ave. were lots of shops and restaurants. We had breakfast both days at Morning Star Cafe which was inexpensive and the food was good but typical diner food. One thing we loved about it was that they serve breakfast all day for those late risers, like us. The burgers and fries looked great too! The other restaurant we ate at on 2nd Ave. was Zarela. The food here was some of the best Mexican cuisine I've had! Not typical enchiladas and tacos but they offered very inventive and fresh dishes. We also purchased some wine at the liquor store on 2nd and brought it back to our room..To get into midtown, we took a cab which was under $10.00. We also purchased Grey Line Hop On-Hop Off tickets and would walk to the U.N. to get on it a few times. Just a hint on driving to the hotel...enter 1st Ave. at 40th St. or below. Make sure you stay in the center lane on 1st Ave. and go through the tunnel. Whatever you do, don't keep left or you won't be able to get over to the right easily to make the right onto 50th St. It's an accident waiting to happen. From 50th make a right onto Beekman Pl. and then a right onto Mitchell Pl. The hotel will be the last building on your right, on the corner of Mitchel and 1st. There are spaces for unloading. My GPS kept trying to take me on the FDR but I later realized I had it set for highways vs. local roads. I used my own common sense to get there anyway."
48,1752,"Nov 14 2008	Great location good hotel	Good hotel at a great price - and that's unusual for New York. Upmarket location, close to the UN buildings. Quiet area in the evenings, busy during the day. The hotel is very quiet, we were on the 5th floor and heard no noise as long as the windows were closed. The staff were very helpful in every respect and the room was well maintained throughout our stay. We got clean towels every day and fresh bedding every other dayThe accommodation was very comfortable (apart from a rather ancient sofa bed which was suffered by our daughter). The bedroom was well appointed and the bathroom very serviceable although small. The power shower was fantastic. It was great to have a small kitchen. It meant that we could bring take away food in rather than having to pay restaurant prices all the time. Speaking of restaurants, there's a small restaurant across the road on the corner - we only found it on the last day and it would have been useful to have done so earlier, The blueberry and banana yoghurt muffins at Tal Bakery up the road are to die for! We had drinks and one breakfast in the Beekman Tower - well worth going up there for the amazing views."
49,1752,"Nov 14 2008 	Be Careful	We stayed at the hotel while in NY to see the US Open. Hotel is a little on the worn side, but the rooms were spacious and comfortably accomodated our family of four. Overall, we had a good trip. The problem came 15 months later when an unauthorized charge appeared on my credit card in the amount of $244 for The Beekman Towers. I have called the hotel four times over the past two days to try to get an explanation, but the staff at the front desk says they can't help and the accountant is not available. It is possible that there was an honest mistake, but given that the staff are not the least bit concerned and they have not made any effort to assist me, I doubt it. I cancelled the card immediately and will now have to go through the hassle of setting up another account."
50,1752,"Nov 4 2008 	Great Location Good and clean!	Well finding somewhere less expensive in New York is impossible if you want to stay in Manhattan. We booked this through expedia as it was on a 24hr sale, and found the reviews were pretty accurate. It is a funky boutique hotel that is clean with huge rooms (well ours was) and a small bathroom, not that that matters, and the shower was EXCELLENT!!!! Location wise this hotel cannot be beat, we walked everywhere from here, or got the subway.The area is lovely, as its close the UN building the restaurants are plentiful and varied, and lots of deli's too, plenty of places for breakfast. loved the location - go to the UN building and send a postcard with your photo on the stamp!!!I liked the hotel alot, it was very clean and the staff were very polite, it had everything we needed and it had the BEST sound proofed windows, once we were in our room we couldn't hear New York at all, which some people may not like :)Would definately stay here again!!"
51,1752,"Oct 16 2008 	My first visit to New York	I stayed at the Beekman when visiting New York on business, as it was very convenient for the UN building. This was my first experience of NY and I was hooked.The building has an interesting history, having been built for use by the Sororities of the US Womens Universities. It has an Art Deco look to it and it is still impressive in a city of skyscrapers!The receptionist was friendly (must have been the Brit accent!) and the suite was more like a small apartment! It was clean, well furnished and each bedroom (2) had an en suite. The views were amazing, looking out over the East River and the New York skyline.The only real letdown was the hotel restaurant/bar, which was very expensive and very limited. We decided to forgo the views over the city and head into the neghbourhood, where we found a nice Italian restaurant (which I have since been back to!)The hotel is just a few blocks away from Central Park and the Empire State Building and we felt quite safe walking to the latter at night."
52,1752,"Oct 5 2008 	Never been happier	Visiting my daughter in the city with a few friends required a hotel stay. We were so pleasantly surprised with our stay. The trip started with one of the most wonderful drivers (recommended by the staff) picking us up at the airport (ended this way, too). But the middle was what counts. The staff treated us like we were royalty. I have stayed in far more elegant hotels, but this establishment made us feel as though we were diplomats at the nearby United Nations. The location was great, but I cannot say enough about the staff. I would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat!"
53,1752,"Sep 3 2008 	A Nice Stay	We stayed two nights while in town to attend the Metropolitan Opera. The Beekman Tower, located very near to the UN, has a roof level restaurant with wonderful views of the city, and the food, while not Michelin star quality, was fine. The hotel entryway and lobby are small and not outstanding, but the room was fine. The room enters from the hallway onto a small kitchen that has a table and chairs. The bedroom was spacious enough, and the bathroom was OK. It wasn't the Ritz, but then the cost was quite reasonable for an NYC hotel."
54,1752,"Sep 1 2008 	Spacious Clean Great Location	The hotel staff were both helpful and friendly. I was unsure of what the hotel would be like because it was cheaper than a lot of hotels. My concerns were put to rest when we entered our room. We had a studio which came with a small kitchen and a large room with a double bed and sofa. We had a great view from the 19th floor which looked out to the East river. The room was a bit dated but who cares it was clean and comfortable. We ordered room service for breakfast on our first day and were disapointed with how greasy it was, also if you do decide to order breakfast make sure to buy your own juice and keep it in the fridge as the beverages on the menu were expensive. There is a small market right across the street where be purchased bread, eggs and fruit to make our own breakfasts for the rest of our stay. It was a great location the streets were very safe as they were mostly residential buildings and the doormen are always out front on the streets so you feel quite safe walking home at night especially for women. You are about a 10 minute walk to 5th ave and about a 15-20minute walk to Times Square. I would stay here again and recomend it to anyone going to New York."
55,1752,"Aug 28 2008	sucks	has rats in rooms, even roaches horrible hotel"
56,1752,"Aug 21 2008 	Fantastic value for money great location	The hotel was in the most perfect loation for seeing everything that we wanted to in New York. We arrived to a very friendly welcome, the staff were very attentive, we arrived too early so we just left our cases with the porter. within 10 minutes we were right on 5th Avenue and able to get to everywhere we wanted to visit by walking. The room was clean and comfortable, I have quite high standards and it may be time for a modernisation but to be honest the rooms were so well equiped that it jus added to the art deco charm. We had a great comfy sofa and a cute little kitchenette so we could have cold drinks out of the fridge which is always useful. We had a hairdryer in the room, safe and air con. There were plenty of lifts always ready and the restaurant/cocktail bar was fabulous. We ordered room service breakfast and it was delivered hot, fresh right on time. Good selection of cold/cooked, great croissants/fruit salad and amazing eggs benedict. Really enjoyed staying here, for the price we paid we were very impressed."
57,1752,"Jul 25 2008 	Served its purpose but wouldn't stay again	A family of 2 adults and 2 teenages, we were really looking forward to this hotel after seeing its website. We had just left the Sherton in Boston which is pristine and I thought things could only get better, plus the Beekman Tower was art deco in style. When we arrived and got to the room the decor and furnishings looked really tired and it looked like it could do with another hovering. There was one double bed and a sofa bed which wasn't very comfortable. I was really very disappointed.There was only one mirror in the room and that was in the bathroom so getting ready in the mornings took some time. The airconditioning was quite loud.On a plus side it was good having a proper fridge and if I had wanted to cook I could have done. A bit of a walk to the centre but being in New York is all about experiencing the place so we didn't mind. The staff were polite and kind.On reflection if the decor and furnishing could be updated it would be a great hotel. For couples and families with small children"
58,1752,"Jun 1 2008 	A little out of the way but a good value	If you're looking for a location in very close walking distance to the main tourist attractions in Manhattan, this is probably not the best hotel, as it is several blocks east of the beaten path. But, the walk is only a few minutes through safe, quiet residential/commercial areas. There are restaurants and bars within a block or two that are worth checking out. The hotel is pretty quiet, the rooms are the typical size found in Manhattan (e.g. a bit small), and the staff is friendly. The rates seem to be pretty attractive for Manhattan. Our only complaint would be the poor bedding that was in our room, as it was quite stiff. Aside from that, I would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend it to others."
59,1752,"May 31 2008 	Quiet yet perfectly located hotel in New York	Me, my sister and mother went for a weekend for Mums 60th Birthday and wanted somewhere that would suit us all and where we could all stay in the same room. Found the Beekman on Trip Advisor and booked due to good reviews - we weren't disappointed. Lots of space, great views, ideally located if you don't want to be near hustle and bustle but still near enough to walk to the mid town attractions like Times Square, Rockefeller, Grand Central Station etc. We booked the hop on/hop off open top bus tour which has a stop 2 mins walk from the hotel outside the UN which gets you to all the main sights of NY - is also a main bus stop which get you anywhere you need to go. Cleanliness of room wasn't perfect in corners and under beds but we had clean towels everyday, beds made and the kitchenette was cleaned on our return daily. Staff were brilliant and extremely friendly - they helped us with booking a car back to the airport and finding out times of broadway shows. Great diner - United - across the road and also a 24 hour convenience store. Chinese just up the road on 1st Ave delivers to your room in the hotel and was good value. All in all a great find - we will be booking again."
60,1752,"May 31 2008 	This should be a 1 star hotel	This was the worst stay I've had in New York. The room was dirty, the furniture stained and thread bare. I've read some of these other reviews and we must have stayed at different hotels. The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is it's location."
61,1752,"May 28 2008 	Great Time	I stayed here with my partner for 6 nights. We enjoyed excellent views on 1st Ave and the East River from our room on the 21st floor. Yes, the interior seemed slightly dated and there was dust to be found here and there. But the real luxury was SPACE. We used our well-fitted kitchenette every day and appreciated that there was a real table to sit down and have a coffee in the morning when planning our days. As an extra perk, a free copy of the New York Times was delivered daily on our doorstep.You should't stay here if you don't like walking: getting to the main midtown spots takes about 20-25 mins on foot. To save us some of the walking, we took the M42 bus several times. It serves the whole length of 42nd Street in both directions and starts from the UN, just a couple of blocks down from the hotel.The reception staff was extremely nice and helpful. When we enquired about taxis to Newark airport before our departure, they recommended their hotel limousine service, which turned out to be cheaper than hailing a cab in the street.For us, the Beekman was the perfect base for a great week in NY."
62,1752,"May 19 2008 	Good Hotel For the Price	My Wife and I spent two nights at The Beekman Tower during a New York weekend getaway. PROs The price. For two nights with taxes and everything ended up being around $460 Having done a lot of research this was a good deal for a hotel with decent reviews in NY. Size: A lot of people reviewing other NYC hotels complained about the size. The room had a small kitchen and thus was bigger than most other NYC average hotel rooms reviewed on trip advisors. Location: This might be a negative for some but for us it was nice to feel a little away from it all when we finally came back to the hotel to relax. The hot spots such as Broadway and Times Square are a little bit of a walk but my wife and I love to walk so it wasnt a big deal. Neighborhood: Because the hotel is close to the United Nations the neighborhood has a lot of houses that serve as the office space for different countries missions to the UN. Just by walking around you can see many different countries represented with their flags out front. Around the hotel are restaurants and shops that are fun and a lot less pricey than Times Square or other NYC tourist hot spots. One of our favorites was Zip Burger 3001/2 52nd Street which tasted a lot like Five Guys for those who are familiar with that Mid Atlantic burger chain. Zip not only had great burgers and fries but shakes as well. Service and Staff: We didnt order room service or have to much interaction with the staff. They were helpful in storing our baggage when we checked out and answering any questions. The hotel delivers a complimentary paper every morning to your roomCONSThe hotel has a worn feeling to it and yes a small lobby. The rooms are functional but could use a remodel getting new carpet and updated bathrooms etc. Some hotels have showers that feel inviting and leave you refreshed. The Beekman does not. The shower had problems with mold and the bathroom looks very worn out. TipsGetting Around: Not being from NY it took a little while to get the swing of the subway system. The actual Subway stations dont give out free maps. We purchased a Street Smart NYC walking map and were able to get around great. It had all the streets in Manhattan and overlayed all of the metro stops. Little Italy is well really little. This was probably our biggest disappointment as we thought that the neighborhood would have at least 4-5 blocks of great Italian restaurants and stores etc. What exists of little Italy these days are only a 1-2 blocks or so of mostly tourist focused restaurants and is not a full neighborhood at all. Broadway Tickets: Like many visiting NY we took our chances and stood in line for half price theater tickets. www.tdf.org We were able to get  price tickets to see Marry Poppins. The show was wonderful and the set was absolutely amazing. Bus Transportation to NY We traveled to NY via the DC2NY bus. www.DC2NY.com Two round trip tickets purchased on the internet cost $80 total which beats hands down driving, gas, parking fees and the NY congestion tax to get into the city. The ride up confirmed just about every stereotype you could have about taking the bus to NY. While still in DC the bus was clipped by another car which delayed us. Midway thru the trip the stench from the bathroom was overpowering. The driver finally caught wind of it all the way up front and got on the bus PA system and asked that someone go to the bathroom and flush it so the smell would hopefully go away. Finally the driver had bad directions and missed the exit. Some people on the bus who knew the route well started to flip out. We ended up being about 2 hours late. Those who had Macs could also not use the wireless internet and one girl almost lost it when she couldnt log on. The ride down was the exact opposite. Fast efficient driver, no weird smells from the bathroom and an on time schedule. So I guess its a mixed bag with this company depending on the bus, the driver and the bathroom being clean and functioning.  Dinning: We loved Serendipity3 www.serendipity3.com It a very cozy unique restaurant that has great tasting food but above all amazing desserts. Because its so small seating can be a challenge. Since their was only two of us we were able to get in quicker. It can take awhile to accommodate larger groups."
63,1752,"May 19 2008 	Ideal Hotel for Midtown Adventures	We stayed at the Beekman for two weeks in early May, selecting it because of its proximity to the UN where my boyfriend had business. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel. Location - The location is excellent. It's a quick walk to most midtown attractions, but away from the touristy insanity of Times Square. We liked the many small delis, grocers, pubs and restaurants in the quiet area that surrounds the hotel, particularly SipSak Turkish Cuisine, the Manchester Pub and Buttercup Bakery (all on 2nd Avenue between 48th and 53rd). It's also a short walk to Times Square and Little Brasil (46th between 5th and 6th) and a rather longish walk to Restaurant Row in Hell's Kitchen. The hotel is also only four blocks to the 51st Street Subway station, which I took full advantage of in my explorations. There is also an uptown bus stop right outside the front door and an crosstown stop across the street. Using the metro or buses, you can get anywhere in the five boroughs.Staff - the staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't have any problems with our room, although others who were attending the same event did and they were quickly and politely rectified. The kitchen was nice to have, given the length of our stay. A few groceries from UN Gourmet across the street meant not having to eat breakfast out every morning and cold beer in the fridge at the end of a long day.Room - We were in 18A1 and while, yes the decor is a bit tired, the room was clean and comfortable. Ask for a higher floor when making a reservation. That way you can leave your window open at night without the noise and fumes from the street being unbearable.Services - We didn't try the gym (my boyfriend was working and I prefered to traipse around Manhattan for exercise). We did use the front desk and the doormen for dining and sightseeing information and they were very helpful.Restaurants - We didn't eat at the Top of the Tower, but it's well worth the pricey cocktails for the view. We also didn't try room service. Actually, the lack of a lobby lounge would be my only complaint about the Beekman. The Zephyr Bar and Grill was closed during our stay and some days we just wanted somewhere casual to regroup before heading out for the night.Overall, we had a great visit to NYC and would certainly choose the Beekman again."
64,1752,"May 18 2008 	The Beekman Tower has its advantages	This hotel is in a good location next to the United Nations. It is a fairly easy walk to 5th Avenue and other midtown locations. There are lots of places to eat nearby.The lobby was a disappointment- the Beekman Tower is an art deco style hotel (on the outside) so we hoped for something more stylish. We were happy with the room- it was a one bedroom suite. My friend stayed in the bedroom and I took the pullout couch, which was not bad. There was a nice bathroom and a full kitchen. The housekeeping staff was very attentive.We did not try the restaurant, but we did get room service and the pizza and burger we ordered were just fine. We brought our own wine and had fun hanging out in the room. We were so busy during the day we were very tired at night. The room was quiet enough, we both slept fine.The ugly old green carpet is still there, which others have mentioned. The rest of the room was just fine for a three star hotel."
65,1752,"May 8 2008 	Good value hotel	Stayed for 5 nights at this hotel in March, found it absolutely fine. It was a little on the old side decor-wise, but comfortable and clean. Plus, because you get a suite, you get space to lounge on the sofa and watch tv, which we tended to do most nights because we were so exhausted fromthe day's sightseeing and the jet-lag - we bought beer which we kept in the fridge in the kitchen, and felt right at home coming back to relax after a hard day out.The hotel is walking distance from most central NYC attractions (eg 15 - 20 mins to ESB) and near to tube for other sights. Don't miss the Nations diner across the road, fantastic for breakfast, and absolutely no need to look elsewhere. OK, it's not right on Times Square but we managed to walk everywhere and saw plenty that we wouldn't have if we'd been right in the heart of the tourist area (eg different restaurants, shops etc)All in all, a fine budget hotel with lots of comforts and a great base for exploring NYC"
66,1752,"May 6 2008 	Loads of Room!	While this hotel is slightly off the beaten path (1 block north of the United Nations)...ie not close to the subway system (8-11 blocks) and a hearty walk to the Theater district (7 blocks), the room we had 23C was clean and spacious. Our hotel room had a King size bed in the bedroom, a separate living room that included a dining room table, and a small full kitchen and a great view of the city. We had more space than we knew what to do with for just the two of us. That said, the decor is definitely out dated and the carpet needs replaced. Not that it was too dirty to walk on just that it was green and looked like it was ready to retire. That said management will be in the process of remodeling the hotel soon. My only complaint is that we must have been close to the exhaust from the restaurant as we could smell food all the time. We overcame that by just keeping the windows slightly open and it was no big deal. Many of my other family members stayed at this hotel as well and the rooms varied some with more updated bathrooms than others but all had the same green carpeting and furnishings.. If you chose to stay here and you don't like your room ..just ask for a different one. The higher up you stay the better the view. I would definitely come back to this place with my kids as having the spacious rooms and a kitchen would be a MUST. This hotel has a ton of potential and I am sure the price of these suites will be a lot higher once it is re-done. So take advantage of this hotel while you can! Also don't forget to stop up on the 26th floor for a drink at the restaurant as the view is amazing but not its food."
67,1752,"May 4 2008	A few bucks and the place would be 4 star	I stayed at the Beekman on a Friday night. Because its on the far east side, there is typically safe and free street parking all weekend. Thats worth $50 right there. It is also away from the NYC night life so it was relatively quiet at night. Thats good because its not a high rise where you need to be above the 30th floor to get away from the noise and lights. I was upgraded to a large suite which is basically a one bedroom apt. Like many NYC apts, the bathroom and kitchen (which I didn't use) were small. The carpet was about 10 years past replacing. Except for the shower head, the bathroom was about 15 years past due for an upgrade but it was clean. The TVs (there were 2) were old but not so old that there were channel change knobs (but close). There was a dining room table large enough to seat 8 which I think was put there to fill the large living room. The couch was something out of a 1950s movie. If the owners put about $2000 into the suite, it would equal or exceed the better hotels of NYC."
68,1752,"Apr 22 2008 	Rave reviews for the staff	Our daughter is a freshman at Columbia University and we have been experimenting with different hotels in an attempt to find a hotel that we can depend on when we come to the city for visits. The Beekman Tower, which we found from a Hotwire email promotion, has ended our search :) I booked a studio queen for $190/night over a weekend. When we arrived there was some confusion at the front desk because there was a staff person in training and she entered our name without the O', so the printout she asked me to sign had the wrong room rate. The manager on duty, Chris Brown, was hovering nearby and was quick to jump in, help her resolve the problem without embarassing her, and for our &quot;trouble&quot; upgraded us to a king bedded suite, with a full kitchen, dining area, living area, two bathrooms.......and a view! I had been kidding him about how we wanted a view, knowing full well that we had gotten an internet deal and were probably going to be relegated to the 2nd floor and he had been reviewing the room availability with the trainee, and told me (before the error) that he could put us on the 18th floor. When the error was discovered, he did not backpedal at all, gave us a great room for the same price...........in fact, when we decided to extend our stay over Sunday night, he graciously honored our discount rate for that night...........and if you've read this website for other hotels before, that rarely happens. In addition to this, the doorman advised us on Saturday night that we didn't need to pay $xxx to park our car in the garage, that the city allowed overnight parking on the street in front of the hotel from Sat until 8 am on Monday( and telling us exactly when he was on duty, so we knew our car wasn't being &quot;guarded&quot; the entire time), saving us easily $100......the restaurant at the top of the hotel is just ok, but the view is worth the concession in dinner............unless its your only night, I definitely wouldn't waste a meal on this restaurant unless I had one to spare. We had had a late lunch with our daughter after a track meet so my husband and I went up to the restaurant later in the evening and had drinks and their sampler plate from the appetizer menu, and it was fine. Oh, and did I mention that the doorman remembered our name the next time he saw us, after saving us the parking fee (we did tip him $20 but not enough that I would have expected this treatment) he acknowledged us by name. All in all, we'll be staying here every time we visit our daughter......assuming of course we get the same great rate, but not expecting the triple upgrade every time...though it would be nice."
69,1752,"Apr 8 2008 	Loved the Beekman!	My husband and I have just returned from New York and stayed at the Beekman Hotel. The occasion was my my birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel.The room was spacious with two large wardrobes and the kitchen area had fridge (for the beers and wine), coffee and machine (for the morning after) and plenty of towels in the bathroom.We ate at the Top of the Tower restaurant on my birthday and had a really good meal. We didn't drink in the bar but it looked lively and the views from this place are fantastic.The location of the hotel is great - Eastside is full of restaurants and quirky little places. You just have to do a bit of walking to find them. Lasagne italian restaurant served fab lasagne(!) and the Irish bar Pig and Whistle serves good food too.Breakfast at the Nations cafe across the road is really good and sets you up for the day's sightseeing and shopping.We were asked if we would like a car back to the airport and this was arranged by the bell hop. A yellow cab in was $55 including toll charges, which is a set price from JFK to Manhattan. However they charge on the meter going back, so can be expensive. We took up the offer of a car from the hotel and for the same price we went back in style in a limo."
70,1752,"Mar 31 2008 	loads of room!!	Checked out this Hotel online,was looking for a room with a bit of space to chill out in. Want disappointed, room was massive. Small kitchen area was ideal but the living space was huge. Not the most modern interior, a bit &quot; shabby chic&quot; but an ideal place to relax after walking all day. Not a bad location if you dont mind walking around, use the bus service that runs right past the door.I was in a suite ( smoking) on the 11th floor,aks for a room high up as the views are pretty good. Had an excellent week here!!"
71,1752,"Mar 24 2008 	Stay Away!	First, the service: My husband and I booked our hotel room on Hotwire in January 2008 for three nights in March. The room was for us and three children, so we thought we better call to make sure the room was going to be able to accommodate us all. We called the next day and were told by the Beekman employee on the phone that we currently only had a room with one queen bed reserved, however for an additional $30 per night, we could upgrade to a one-bedroom suite with a queen bed and fold out couch, so we did. When we arrived at the Beekman, we signed a piece of paper at the front desk that said one-bedroom suite, however the room was anything but. It was a tiny room with one bed and small kitchenette and thats it. Barely enough room for a roll-away. So we went back down to the front desk and told the gentleman there was a mistake, that we had reserved a one-bedroom suite. He said they were totally booked for that night, apologized, and started calling around to other hotels in Manhattan to send us to. Our assumption is that since we arrived at the hotel late at night, they gave our one-bedroom suite away to someone else. Anyway, he gave us a letter that was addressed to the Affinia Manhattan Hotel and $20 cab fare and told us that this Affinia Hotel could accommodate us for that night and to come back the next day and the Beekman would have a suite ready for us for the next two nights. So we took the cab to the Affinia Hotel, only to find out that they could not accommodate five people either. So they sent us back to the Beekman and our only choice was to take the tiny room and deal with it. The Beekman offered to pay for the cab fare to and from the Affinia Hotel, free breakfast the next morning, and the first nights reservation free. We went up to the tiny room, they brought us a roll-away and my husband and I slept on the floor. The next morning we packed up and went down to the front desk to have them hold our bags for the day and make sure they really did have a suite ready for us that night and the next. The woman (Heather) was rude, patronizing, and of course we had to explain the ENTIRE story to her, as she knew nothing about the situation, and she was not the least bit empathetic. She assured us we had a suite booked for that night and the next. So we went out for the day, and came back later and sure enough, the suite was awaiting us. This room was much more spacious. We still had to get a roll-away, but at least nobody had to sleep on the floor. Much to our dismay, when we received the bill on the third morning, they charged us for the breakfast, the cab fare, and three upgrade fees at $60 each. After complaining to the front desk (to whom we AGAIN had to explain the whole story) they took off one upgrade fee, the breakfast and the cab fare. We now have a mysterious $16 charge on our credit card that we can only assume is for the roll-away, as we had no parking charges because we didnt have a car. I cant muster up the energy to call about that at this point. We prepaid Hotwire for all three nights, so I am assuming the first night free promise will never materialize. Now, for the rooms: Dirty. Very old and dirty. The bathroom fixtures and appliances were in desperate need of an upgrade, there was mold on the bathroom wall around the window, the floors were dirty and the carpet was bunching up and folding in places (obviously needs replaced), the water was brown when we first turned it on in the shower, just all kinds of problems. The heating/cooling unit was also difficult to deal with. The one bed hotel room (the first night) was especially old and dirty. Hotwire has this hotel rated a three-star. I can only assume the rating is based on the lobby and the location alone. Everything else was a mess. The only good thing about the rooms was the kitchenette. That was decent. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, nor will I ever stay here again. The location was okay, the restaurant across the street called the Nations Caf (I believe) was very good and the service there was wonderful. Do not stay here if you have ANY other options, and if you do have to stay here, call to confirm your reservation and get the persons name you speak with. Without that, youre obviously a liar, according to the front desk personnel."
72,1752,"Feb 21 2008	Mixed bag	Im not really sure how to rate the Beekman Tower Hotel, because there were things about it I likedand the things that detracted from our stay may not bother other guests. First things first: the hotel's just north of the UN and yes, there is a bit of a walk to the 51st Street subway. But the M15 goes along 2nd Avenue (inbound) and 1st Avenue (outbound), which was a big timesaver. There isnt a heck of lot right in the immediate vicinity  its mostly residential  but it was quiet. We did not make it up to the 26th floor for a drink, but the view from our 21st floor suite was pretty cool.I booked the hotel for two nights after finding a Travelzoo special ($179 for a studio queen) and it was quite a deal  a roughly 400 sq.ft. space with a separate, full kitchenette (including a dishwasher, stove, wine glasses, etc.), dining area, bedroom, and private bath. Theres a convenience store across the street for breakfast fixings; the hotel provides the free NY Times each day for your lingering-over-coffee enjoyment. So what's the problem? Well, I have an allergy to dust mites and havent had a flare-up for over a year. I've since stayed in hotels without incident but for each of the two nights at Beekman, my symptoms kept me awake and unable to sleep. On my second night, NyQuil knocked me out for five hours, but that was about it. I woke up again with the same symptoms.Also, our room was just too warm and the fan/cooler function wasnt working. We alerted the front desk to this and the concierge left a message with the maintenance staff, but as far as I know, this remained unfixed during our stay. Once we found that the windows opened, though, we got around the problem that way  we left one window open about 4 inches during the day, kept it open during the night and things were better.I did not have this issue before going to NYC which leads me to suspect that perhaps the room was not as clean as it looked on the surface. Im reluctant to say that because I could be very wrong and what I experienced was a flukethe bed linens certainly _looked_ clean, but Im at a loss to explain why my symptoms flared up when they did. (They subsided when we returned home.) Perhaps the sheets were fine but the mattress was too old  my husband complained of a sag on his side.I know that hotel rooms are never fully clean and it's caveat emptor. But it's too bad because otherwise this is a very good value for NYC. YMMV."
73,1752,"Feb 11 2008 	Good value good location...a good choice	Stayed here one night for business. For the price I got via Hotwire (200 and change), I cannot complain. Location is fine (east midtown) if you don't mind being a bit of a walk from the real midtown hotspots.Room was much larger that what I am accustomed to with NYC hotels, and had a kitchenette. It was not fabously decorated or anything like that, but that was not something I needed. I found it clean and quite.Front desk staff was quite helpful. I grabbed a drink in the bar at the top of the hotel. Fabulous views of the city. I would not recommend if you are looking for a honeymoon or other highly romantic or special, once in a lifetime desintation hotel...but for a quality, reasonably priced hotel in Midtown, this is a good option."
74,1752,"Jan 30 2008 	Beekman Tower - Fantatic	My husbard, daughter+boyfriend stayed at Beekman Tower for 3nights 24 January 2008. It was our daughters birthday present to go to New York and shop! The Beekman Tower hotel was brilliantly placed - a short walk down 49th to the shops et al. We had two suites (which we had been upgraded on) and they were perfect for our stay. We ate in the restaurant on our first evening (due to being too tired from the flight) and we were not disappointed. The view is fantastic from the 26th Floor Cocktail lounge. We actually used this facility every night before we retired, really the view is breathtaking.Our room was furnished comfortably and the bedding and towels were changed every day!Staff were very accommodating and our bellboy was a hoot. My daughter is saving to go back later this year and she is planning on staying here again.This accommodation is priced correctly and I would highly recommend it. Also, just across the street is the UN Cafe - superb breakfasts!!!Enjoy."
75,1752,"Jan 28 2008 	Not a 3 Star Hotel	I had booked the room through Priceline.com. I was looking for a 3 or 4 Star hotel in mid-town Manhatten for a weekend get-a-way.What I got was the Beekman Tower for $150 a night. Great price for mid-town, but there was a lot to be desired. Location was OK, at 1st and 59th... just a 10-15 min walk to all of the action of midtown. There were a good number of smaller, less popular restaurants in the area. Staff was great, although we did have to wait 40 min to get into our room. The room we had was a studio next to the compactor room.So from time to time there was a lot of clanking coming from the next room. We were on the 17th floor, with a view of 1st street heading north. The room was clean enough-- but the rooms needed a face lift. Carpets were old and tired, and I felt like I was staying at someone's grandmother's house."
76,1752,"Jan 24 2008 	Fantastic Hotel - great value	Where do I start? I thought this hotel before we went would be just be a typicl value for money type hotel as we got a great deal. And before I start properly I should say that a hotel room is fine for me if it is comfortable, clean and functional as we spend very little time in a hotel room when on holiday as we're too busy out exploring.This hotel was just that, functional, comfortable and clean but you can also add :Spacious, with a huge, extremely comfortable bed, great maid service, great room service menu, great hairdryer (at most hotels you usually get some tiny thing masquerading as a hairdryer but not in the Beekman), seperate kitchen/eating area, lounge area with tv, prompt courteous service (I waited around a minute to be bought additional pillows and a hairdryer) and a great power shower in a clean bathroom! (The shower is awesome..insignificant things please me!)The location was fine for me, granted it wasn't slap bang in the centre of Manhattan but we like a walk and you can get a taxi to most places in Manhattan for less that $10 plus tip. It took us ten minutes to walk to the Rockerfella centre and a further five to reach Times Square. It also takes around 10 minutes to walk to Grand Central to take the subway to most places on the island. Side note - if you want a very, very central hotel this might not be for you but if you don't mind a few short walks then it's fine.But nearby there was the UN Diner (opposite) for great value breakfasts as well as a grocery store if you wanted to take any food back to the hotel and an off licence.We found a great little irish bar (McCanns on 1st) which was really friendly and very cheap for a few drinks, two minutes walk on 1st Avenue just up from the hotel - head northwards.There's also lots of nice restaurants on 49th street as you walk towards Rockerfella centre.The best part of this hotel is the lovely restaurant at the &quot;Top of the Tower&quot; serves food till 10pm and drinks till 1am. If you like great food and drink, good service, fantastic nighttime views over Manhattan and a great environment then make sure you use the restaurant at least one night if you can.The queue of people before us as we checked out all complimented the hotel on check-out.When we return to New York in the future we will be staying at the Beekman and I highly recomment others do too."
77,1752,"Jan 17 2008 	Mixed bag at the Beekman Tower	The room was very large for an NYC hotel room - a suite, with a separate bedroom and living area with a sofa bed and a kitchenette. The room furnishings were in poor condition. The first thing I saw when I walked into the room was the sight of a sofa with stained fabric and frayed piping around the cushions. Having booked on Hotwire, not knowing what I was getting myself into, I worried that I really went wrong. Fortunately, the bathroom and bedding were clean. Staff were helpful and friendly. I would consider a stay again, as the price and location were good, and the room would be good for a family stay, as kids could sleep in one room and parents in the other. But if you want a room with nice furnishings, I would suggest that you choose another hotel."
78,1752,"Jan 4 2008 	Only average best avoided	The Beekman was our major &quot;spend&quot; for a week in NY, we chose to spend a few nights out in Queens to save money, and finish off the week with a couple of nights in the supposedly nice Beekman Hotel on Manhattan.We booked a stay in the Beekman via an online booking agent, which is where our problems began. The booking had been cancelled by the Beekman due to payment not getting made as of our time of check-in by the booking agent. Not their problem I guess, but the manager we spoke to had to be the rudest person I met in NY all week - we were obviously in a spot of bother, and the best she could offer us was a different (lesser) room, which would have been OK, except she insisted on charging us UPFRONT for the full room rate, plus some. As finding a room at such late notice in NY is next to impossible, we were forced into taking this room. When I tried to reason with the manager regarding the price, suggesting that the rate they were supposed to have been paid by the agent (and which we had booked at) was approximately half of this value, she refused to cooperate. Her perogative I guess, but a terrible attitude in general.The room itself was indeed massive (I think it was one of their &quot;studios&quot;), but it was in a different building, with no porter service offered. The room was in a fairly decrepit state (possibly why it was still empty), and not clean enough by any stretch. The sheets on the bed were also threadbare and rough, which is not what you expect when paying over US$450 per night! The only good thing was access to a (very old and broken) kitchentte, and the minimal street noise we were subject to due to our location - necessary as we needed to have the windows open for ventilation as there was no cooling or heating to speak of!Overall, I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone - if you book a few months in advance, you can get a lot nicer in Manhattan for less money. I could have forgiven some of the failings if it weren't for the most obnoxious management I have ever come across - if the hotel wants to accept business from agents, then they should be more accomdating to problems such as we had, rather than viewing them as a means to double their money."
79,1752,"Jan 3 2008 	A NY rarity - a superb value hotel	My wife and I recently stayed for a short break over the holiday period. We booked several months in advance and got a great rate. We could not have been happier with the Beekman. The hotel is located on 1st Ave near the UN building. Its an easy, pleasant walk to 5th Ave / Rockefeller Centre and everything in Midtown. Plenty of taxi's stream past the hotel if you prefer. A nearby diner and local restaurants kept us well fed.The room had a kitchen, bathroom, large wardrobe and a sofa - it was great to be able to sit down, other than on the bed, after a day walking around.The Cocktail Bar the top of the tower offered great views of the river and across into Brooklyn. The martinis were fearsomely strong.As a frequent traveller to NY in the past the Beekman represented something new and surprising. It was quiet, clean, the rooms were large, the staff pleasant and friendly and excellent value for money. I will use the hotel again.A few niggles - the carpet in the hotel could do with replacing and the TV was also showing signs of age. But otherwise it was perfect."
80,1752,"Jan 2 2008 	Perfect for the Price 	Stayed here with my husband over Christmas and what a treat! Not only was the room a very good size for Manhattan hotel, it was spotlessly clean, spacious, comfortable and importantly quiet. It was an ideal location for us, a few blocks from the hustle of Mid-Town with a great diner opposite, fantastic cocktails on the top floor of the hotel and just a friendly hotel in a good neighbourhood. I've stayed in NY for over many years and this is one of the best hotels. Try it!"
81,1752,"Dec 28 2007	Wow what a Room	I went with a group to New York to tour the United Nations. The UN was a few blocks away! The room was huge with a kitchen, living room and bedroom. Everything was clean and comfortable. The lounge on the top floor is the perfect place to have a drink and relax. A cab to time square is only $7.50. Perfect place for a New York vacation. Stop by the Pressbox Bar a few blocks down and have a drink with bartender Shawn and the doorman, great conversation and drinks!"
82,1752,"Dec 23 2007 	Don't hesitate. Solid Hotel.	My wife and I wanted something other than the typical pricey Times Square Hotel and we were very pleased. We were unpgraded to a 1br and could have brought the kids with plenty of room. We ended up walking to Times Square anyway, but it was nice to stay outside the norm.Very nice hotel. Not luxurious. But at $200. It was better than staying in a Marriott Courtyard (which is what we usually do)."
83,1752,"Dec 16 2007 	great mini break	stayed here for 4 days, excellent location, easy walking distance to times square, shops etc, hotel in quieter part of new york overlooking east river,not far from La guardia or jfk airport, $45-$55 dollars transfer, hotel will organise limo as they do not call taxi's to collect at hotel, this is more expensive though. The hotel was clean and staff very helpful, the heating in the suite was very effective, too hot most of the time, had to turn it off, it was one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in, very handy with the kitchen and seperate lounge. great time had by all, would certainly go back to this hotel, everyone should go to new york once before they die!!!!"
84,1752,Nov 13 2007 	Loved the Beekman - Old School Class	The Beekman was amazing. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with a great view. We got the room for only $112 a night last minute!It is not located in the centre of tourist Manhatten but I found this refreshing. After staying near Times Square and participating in the tourist life it was nice to come across to what felt like a more residential area. The restaurants nearby were quaint and we felt it was a very safe area. An enjoyable stay and a great end to a NY holiday.
85,1752,"Nov 7 2007	I'd stay there again	The front desk guy was really helpful and accommodating. We checked in late, so there wasn't a room with a view left, but he put us in a room that had little street noise (our 2nd preference). The view was of the building next door (not great), but at least it wasn't noisy. We only stayed one night and the bed was comfortable, the room was clean, and the showerheads had pretty good water pressure. We had the one bedroom suite and I used my credit card points for it. Although, I had a good experience, I wouldn't pay over $300 a night (including taxes and fees). The location was pretty good also. We walked to the theatre district and it was a pretty nice stroll (even with my heels on)."
86,1752,"Nov 7 2007 	No Real Downside	Just got back from NY - stayed 4 nights at the Beekman Tower Hotel. No real problems at all. The rooms are basic but clean with a handy kitchen area. We had 4 chaps in one room and requested an extra bed which was provided. On 49th street and 1st Avenue which is close enough to the action and when you are on the 14th floor you don't hear too much of the traffic noise in the early mornings.Use the cabs - not expensive and you can get one in seconds - 13,000 in New York I believe. Also the underground $7 for 2 days unlimited travel - great idea and beats the buses.Iris bars everywhere - 3 round the corner - good food in Clancy's and The Jameson - better booze selection too.The Beekman is a good base and from what I hear unless you want to pay serious money you wont do much better"
87,1752,"Nov 6 2007 	Sleepless in Beekman	Our experience at the Beekman was terrible. As per other reviews, the pictures on the internet in no way represent the actual rooms (with exception of the curtains). The room we had was very hot and when we turned on the airconditioning, it actually blew out hot air. My husband and I woke up at 4am because we were scratching constantly due to severe itchiness. Once we turned on the lights and pulled the covers back, we found there were little black bugs in our bed. When we went to the front desk to ask them to change rooms immediately, they told us to go back upstairs, back to bed, and they would accomodate a room change for us the next morning. But honestly, how can you go back to bed when you know there are bugs in it? We had booked to stay three nights but left at 4am (the internet provider from which we booked was very helpful in helping us get out of our reservation). The cost of the hotel is very expensive. You'd be better off staying at a 2 star Day's Inn than at this supposed 3.5 star Beekman Towers Hotel."
88,1752,"Oct 28 2007	worst hotel poorest service in new york city	The WORST hotel I've ever stayed in. A lifetime traveller, and someone who frequently stays in New York hotel, I ended up in this pit after my usual was booked.1) The staff has an attitude. The front desk manager, a man named Chris who must have graduated from the Al Queda School of Personality Dynamics, is, without a doubt, the most hostile service employee I have ever encountered.2) In 2007, a New York hotel where the heat, television and internet doesn't work??? I spent nearly two hours on the phone trying to get online, and complaints about heat and television resulted in NOTHING.3) At nearly $500 a night, I would have done better sleeping in a cab for the night and it would have been a whole lot cheaper.4) There should a college course entitled, &quot;How Not to Treat Guests - a Case Study of the Beekman Tower Hotel.&quot;In a word, DON'T."
89,1752,"Oct 27 2007	Beekman needs a facelift!	I had higher hopes for the Beekman, based on other Trip Advisor reviews. This hotel hovers just above the acceptable level. It is true that the suites offer plenty of space for a family of four to spread out--there's a large living room with TV and a separate bedroom for parents (also with TV). The bathroom is off of the bedroom and is rather small. And while the bathroom was clean enough, it lacked the nicer fixtures and amenties that Sheratons, Westins and other chains have to offer. The sink filled with water quickly and we had to be careful not to cause a flood. The entire suite was in desperate need of a makeover. The fabrics are dated and dreary, the wallpaper peeling, and the carpet a bit thin and stained in places. It was warm in NYC during our visit and the AC in the bedroom did not work at all. A large portable AC unit sat in the bedroom, but the remote control did not cause it to turn on. We were able to open windows, but of course, the noise of the traffic on 1st Avenue made it difficult to sleep. The bed was far from the comfy &quot;heavenly&quot; sort that so many hotels offer these days. And the linens and the &quot;vellux&quot;-like blanket were far from luxurious. There was some sort of dried matter on the bedroom blanket--better not to think about what that might have been! The suite had a dated kitchenette with a sticky handle on the refrigerator door and a long dark hair sitting on the countertop--again, not exactly appealing. I stay at the Beekman based on my company's arrangement with the hotel, but I would not stay at the Beekman if I had a choice!"
90,1752,"Oct 25 2007 	Great Hotel - a bit far from centre	We wanted a one bedroom suite for our stay and the Beekman looked ideal - plus we got a very reasonable rate. On arrival, we were initially a bit disappointed as we'd imagined the room would be a little bigger from photos we'd seen, but our stay there was actually great. We were on the 16th floor and had good views of NY city - quite spectacular at night! Sofabed was a bit uncomfortable for our son but we put mattress on floor and it was perfect - the maid made it up there for us too! Our suite was beautifully cleaned every day - sheets, towels etc. Having our own kitchenette was ideal and there's a grocery store conveniently across the street. Only downside was its distance from everything - subway is 10 minutes away so we either walked to most places (about 20 - 25 minutes to Times Sq) or tried to get taxis. Walking was fine but if you factor in that you then walk around any sight you're going to see as well ........... we were getting a bit tired of 'the commute' by the end of our 6 days there. Recommend Nations Cafe across the road for fantastic American breakfasts'Lasagna' restaurant at 50th and 2nd for fab lasagne.Top of the Tower at Beekman has great views but is expensive!"
91,1752,"Oct 23 2007 	An old class pearl	We had a perfect romantic getaway there before our son was born. The location is good, views fantastic (at least from the upper floors) and the rooms comfortable, quite home-like apartments. And we just loved the Sky Bar on the top!"
92,1752,"Oct 14 2007 	Spacious apartment-like rooms	This midtown hotel must have among the biggest rooms NY has on offer. My room was as big as your average New York apartment. It also came with a hefty price tag, around 470 dollars a night, including all the various taxies levied by Bloomberg. I stayed there during the UN General Assembly, when prices were outrageous all over town. I guess you can get a much better rate during the UN's off-season (the hotel is next door to the UN and seems to cater to delegations). In terms of design and furniture, there's nothing to write home about....the usual heavy American Grandpa style you find in hotels all around the country."
93,1752,"Sep 4 2007 	Art Deco	Agree with all other reviews - nice hotel, huge rooms complete with dining rooms and kitchen, in a quieter and pleasant area of the city that's handy for central locations. Great! Staff slightly stand-offish though but isnt that the NYC stereotype? Great place! Air conditioning, convenience shops nearby and close to the UN building. 23 stories of a good hotel."
94,1752,"Aug 31 2007 	1 Bedroom Suite - Nice size Accomodation - Quiet location	The Beekman Tower was a nice place to stay in NYC if you want to be close to midtown, but off the beaten path. It was located on the mid east side of town a short walking distance to the United Nations. The lobby is small with just one clerk, but nevertheless the check in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 19th floor and we had a nice view. When we entered our 1 Bedroom suite, we were thrilled with the overall size of the accomodation. There was a large size Living room with sofa and chair, a full size dining table, a desk and a galley kitchen all in the Living room area of the suite. The kitchen was a galley style with everythiing you would need including a stove, fridge, microwave, dishwasher and coffee pot. The layout of the suite was very nice with lots of room to spread out. The Bedroom was on the small size, but still very nice. The Bathroom was located off of the bedroom and was adequate with the exception of there was only a shower, not a tub (see photo). The furniture and decor was a bit dated, in a traditional style cherry wood, but it was not like it was run down and uncomfortable, just not a luxury, brand new style. I have no real complaints about this hotel as the 1 BD suite was really quite large and we were very pleased considering we paid less than $300 including taxes when booking through Orbitz. For the money we got a great accomodation with lots of square footage and convenience. Another plus was that the hotel was in a more quiet area without the constant traffic and loud street noise. Overall this hotel was just wonderful for those who want some extra space and convenience. We loved our stay at the Beekman Tower. Huge room, quiet location, convenience. It was a very pleasant place to stay in NYC."
95,1752,Aug 14 2007	Fantastic UN Location	Friendly helpful Reception and Porters;a must is the great views from 26th Top of Tower but as all food has to come from 1st floor don't expect the food to match(or service);reasonably priced especially given location though this may change when renovations currently underway are completed;animal friendly;myself and many colleagues found the airconditioning noisy and/or ineffective;the inroom kitchen facilities are great esp if one is staying awhile ;the internet service is very poor; another must is the art deco including the brickwork in the East Tower lobby;rooms large and clean
96,1752,"Aug 6 2007 	Perfect location and accommodation	We are a family of 4 from West Midlands England. Just returned from 6 days in NYC. The trip was to celebrate our eldest son's 21st and we were joined by our 17 year old son. The Beekman more than matched our expectations. We had stayed in NYC on a previous visit in Times Square vicinity. Much preferred Beekman location. Quieter but with good restaurants within a few blocks. Yes there is no subway station close but it is only a 15 minute walk to Grand Central Terminal. Room very large, kitchen very welcome, particularly the fridge in height of summer. The UN diner opposite very good for breakfasts. Check in very prompt, good service and bellman so helpful on last day with luggage and transportation to airport etc.Would definitely recommend the Beekman after this experience."
97,1752,"Aug 1 2007 	Fantastic view from top of the tower	Fantastic views from the cocktail bar at the top of the tower. Hotel was a few blocks to nearest subway but if you purchased a weekly subway ticket you could make use of the buses. Suite was large and well stocked if a little shabby. Quiet area but quite a few decent restaurants/bars in the vicinity. If ever in New York again would use this hotel, however beware of costs to park car whilst in NY - could rent a hotel room in some other cities for the cost of a nights parking."
98,1752,"Jul 26 2007 	Brilliant Value for Money - Highly Recommend	Booked this hotel through lastminute.com after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. We paid about 100 per night for a one bedroomed suite which was huge with a sitting room which had a sofa bed, a fully equipped kitchen (with dishwasher/microwave/fridge freezer/oven &amp; hob) there was a separate bedroom and bathroom. Although the decor was 'tired', the room was immaculately clean with the cleaner even washing up the cups and glasses we had left in the sink during the day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The Beekman was within easy walking distance of fifth avenue/central park and all the museums/shops. Also lots of lovely little restaurants nearby (including a brilliant curry house - Indigo - on 47th and 2nd). Would not recommend eating in hotel but worth visiting top floor for cocktails and the view. Excellent diner and deli across the road. Also worth using the hotel car service ($65) for a stress free and comfortable trip back to JFK. Would definitely stay there again."
99,1752,"Jul 24 2007 	Amazing View!	We stayed in a suite on the 24th floor of the Beekman. The furniture and decor seemed to be newer, less than 4 years old, but was in less than great shape. The carpet was stained, and there was a tear in the couch. Air conditioner didn't work. I never bothered to tell the staff because the weather was mild and we didn't really need it. Sucks to be the next guy who stays in that room if its hot outside. The remote control didn't work. Other than that, the place is great for the money. The suite offered two balconies overlooking Uptown with a fantastic view. The staff was great, and the elevators were very speedy. The hotel is in a great neighborhood with Trump Tower and the U.N. within walking distance. I'd like to point out where to eat and shop in the area, but everything is good! That and the businesses there change hands often so even if I did point out a good restaurant, it will probably be under new management by time you get there."
100,1752,"Jul 23 2007 	Surpassed our expectations!	We spent three nights mid-week at the Beekman and would go back in a New York minute! Our Studio Suite on the 17th floor was roomy and clean with a full kitchen including a microwave and dishwasher. Even though we arrived before the official check-in time, we got a warm reception from the staff who instantly allowed us to use the fitness room to freshen up from the boiling New York heat. A nighttime visit to the cocktail bar on the 26th floor is a must! We'll recommend the Beekman to friends and family and it will be our top choice next time we're in NYC. Tip: Try the Thai restaurant around the corner on 1st Avenue for lunch. Prices were dirt cheap and the food was marvelous."
101,1752,"Jul 23 2007 	Going back to the Beekman	My wife and 14-year-old daughter spent one night in a one-bedroom suite at the Beekman Tower in May. We enjoy taking short weekend trips to Manhattan for fun whenever we are able to get a good price on airfare. We booked the hotel through the Affinia.com website, as this hotel was part of the Affinia hotel group at the time we booked out trip for May. We requested and got a high-floor room with a balcony. The vistas from our balcony on the 20th floor were spectacular - almost unobstructed views of the river and Queensborough bridge. The one-bedroom suite had plenty of space. The bedroom was a little small, but not for Manhattan. The living/dining area was huge, double the size of the bedroom, and had a half bath. It was big enough to house two fold-out sofas, and they both could have been folded out at the same time with no problem. This was a huge room. The kitchen was functional and clean. The location is great, as others have said. It's in a quiet part of town but the walks to tourist and business areas are very reasonable. The things others have said about the furniture being merely functional and a little on the older side are true. That said, we are going back to the Beekman very soon for a two-night stay. We found the hotel to be very clean and comfortable, and the ability to have a child or children sharing the same space without being in the same bedroom with the parents is a real plus for the Beekman (and for several hotels owned by the Affinia group). It appears that the Beekman is no longer associated with the Affinia group, as it is no longer possible to book a room at the Beekman via the Affinia website. We are hoping that the quality of the property is at least equal to the quality when it was an Affinia hotel. I think a lot of people don't understand the Manhattan hotel scene and this gets reflected when they write reviews of Manhattan properties. A hotel suite the size of a one-bedroom at the Beekman (or at the Affinia Manhattan, where we've also stayed) that was decorated to the standard of a luxury hotel would easily cost twice as much on a good day, when you got your best deal. More often, the rate would be three times as much. Check around and you will see that this is true. I would guess the one-bedroom we stayed in at the Beekman was around 900 or maybe even 1,000 square feet total. There are many, many hotels in the same price range in Midtown that offer 300 or so square feet of space for the same money as a large one-bedroom suite at the Beekman. If you pay a decent rate for the Beekman, you are getting a lot for your money."
102,1752,"Jul 9 2007 	Fantastic time	Being our first time in New York, we were a bit nervous as to where we should stay in the city. We wanted to stay somewhere pretty nice, as we were in NY for Christmas! This was an excellent choice. We pretty much walked everywhere from here... we even got up at 5am Christmas morning and walked to the bottom of the island (although it took a few hours).We had excellent service thorughout our stay, and the staff were always happy to stop and have a chat whenever we needed help or had a question.We were more than happy with our room, we had a suite, and it was more than sufficient... we even got our own kitchen (although it wasn't really ever used)!All up, we were thrilled with the Beekman Tower, and would stay again in a heart beat."
103,1752,"Jul 6 2007 	Excellent 1 bedroom suite for $179	I saw the hotel advertised on Travelzoo a few months ago at $179+tax and booked it immediately for July 4th. The hotel was very nice and the location on the east side was about 20 blocks from the fireworks. There is a nice diner across the street and several restaurants nearby. The 1 bedroom suite on the 18th floor was spacious and very clean, like a small apartment in NYC. The room has a kitchenette with a gas stove and a fridge. The bed and couch were comfortable. All the windows open about 8 inches for fresh air. Parking was $37 but I easily found free parking on the street just 2 blocks away. The bathroom is small, but who cares. I would definitely stay here again. Also, a nice rooftop bar. Make sure you put your do not disturb sign on the door, I forgot and was woken up at 7:30am by housekeeping. There is not subway stop nearby, the closest is about a 20 minute walk."
104,1752,"Jul 6 2007 	Good Value for the most part!	Just returned from a five night stay with my husband and son. I agree that the rooms are a little dated but the one bedroom suite was comfortable for a family. At first I was appalled at the condition of the plaid sofa as it was heavily stained and so was the adjacent coffee table. But in the true spirit of a New York survivor, I grabbed a few sheets from a housekeeping cart and draped it over the couch.. After that it was smooth sailing and quite comfortable for our family. True, the kitchen and bathroom are on the old side but very clean and very functional. Staff was very friendly, however, not knowledgeable about the immediate area. All in all, the value was good for NYC. Average cost was $200 a night. I saw many families checking in and out and nothing but smiles! The doormen and bell staff were awesome and seemed to run the show in the lobby. A good experience. I didn't expect perfection on our family budget. Cathy, Arizona"
105,1752,"Jun 28 2007 	Service Beyond Belief	Our car was in front of the hotel waiting for the valet to pick up when a suitcase rolled down the sidewalk and hit the car. knocked a quarter size piece of paint off the fender and a big dent. i've had experiences before where valets have done damage to my car and denied everything. Kathi Suprek, the hotel manager, told me what happened and took responsibilty. Knock me over with a feather. I got an estimate and they sent me a check right away. We booked a one bedroom suite, and they are huge. ask for a high room, views are great. fully furnished kitchen. my son lives in manhattan and it was bigger than his apartment. Top of the Tower is great."
106,1752,"Jun 26 2007 	Okay is a perfect description	I stayed here with two other business colleagues. New York was booked solid due to conventions, so we could either stay at the Beekman for $395 or someplace else for $800. We did the responsible thing and stayed at the Beekman for a night.The staff was very friendly on our initial arrival, but there was some confusion about our rooms. Clearly not as good of a reservation system as you'll find at the larger chains. They gave us one room, and promised the other 2 later. When we returned, they tried to get 2 of us to share a room. Needless to say, I let them know that was not acceptable, and they backed off and gave us two rooms. Not very smart on their part to try and put 2 business people in the same room.The rooms are clean, and decent sized by NY standards. The bed was not the most comfortable, but passable for a night. The big flaw with the rooms was the air conditioning units. They either didn't work well or were very noisy in all of our rooms. None of us got a good night of sleep.At checkout, there was again confusion about payment for the rooms but it got sorted out properly.Overall, it was probably still worth saving our company about $1,500, but this is not a place I would seek out again."
107,1752,"Jun 24 2007 	Very good stay	I stayed at the Beekman in february for five nights in a one bedroom suite for a very reasonable price.The suite was very big (size of a small apartment) and spotless clean. The kitchen was fully equipped, the room had a second tv, ...Staff was friendly and very helpful. The location is good for tourists and business. I absolutely recommend the Beekman."
108,1752,"Jun 23 2007 	Surprisingly good for Manhattan	My wife and I stayed at the Beekman Tower in a studio suite with queen bed and kitchenette, on the 16th floor (suite B) for four nights, starting Saturday, April 14, 2007. The costs (AAA discounted rate) per each night were $207, 189, 225, 207, chronologically, coming to 828 plus 132.79 taxes (total 960.79). This was a surprisingly good place to stay, considering what Manhattan lodging normally offers for this price.The location of this hotel is reasonably good (being centrally located north to south, though not as central east to west), with the nearest subway station being a 10 minute walk away (at 53 St. &amp; 3 Ave.). This area is relatively less bustling, it felt safe, and there are fine restaurant choices within a few minutes walk. The building is a lovely, 26 story, Art Deco tower, with a bar on the top floor offering wonderful views. It should be noted, though, that those not buying drinks are strongly discouraged from partaking of the views, private parties often render this bar/observatory unavailable to the general public, and just two, tiny drinks will leave one feeling light-walleted by $20. Three elevators in the small lobby yielded wait times of no more than a minute or so. The staff we encountered during our visit were knowledgeable, competent, and rather friendly and courteous (by big city standards). Although, we discovered as we went to check out that we could have had a complimentary newspaper delivered to our suite each day, had someone mentioned we could request it.The good-sized suite (roughly 16 x 16 feet), had a living room/bedroom area with TV, coffee table, sofa, two night-stands by the queen bed, clock/radio, a large dresser, two windows which could be opened - though with some difficulty, and a roughly 3 x 3 foot closet with a safe operated by a key. The bathroom was modest in size (roughly 5 x 8 feet), with almost no counter space but one large cabinet under the sink, a tub with shower and a full-flow shower head, and there were the typical U.S. midlevel hotel towels &amp; toiletries, including body gel, lotion, soaps, hair drier, and (as a pleasant surprise) both conditioning shampoo and regular shampoo. The kitchenette (roughly 7 x 8 feet) included a small microwave, small fridge, utensils, plates, etc., a counter and two stools, sink, and range. All amenities in the suite were functioning properly during the time of our stay. We had a fine view of the East River and U.N. We heard no sounds from neighboring suites and almost no street noise.The only negative comments I wish to pass on are that there is no computer available here to check in and print boarding passes and the heat in the room was almost uncontrollable from within the suite (and it was too warm). We either did not look for air-conditioning, or could not find it, or it did not work (I do not recall). So we kept the windows open."
109,1752,"Jun 23 2007 	Even give me a free I would never stay it	The picture of internet was not actually with really hotel room. I was requested for one bed room high floor suite room, but the room was only give me on the 9th floor out of 26st floor, and the bathroom was very very very small(I have been many hotel, but never see it so small). Service was not very good, too. It was make me very unhappy and very angry, I was requested for 3 person room, which is one queen size bed and one sofa bed, but actually it has only give me 2 person bedroom. I was tell than set up for sofa bed in the first night, than after, they were forget it, even I have been requert the sofa bed, but they STILL or try to forget it. The service was not really respecting and care to custome. I really has bad experiences, so Even if it give me one more change or free to stay again. Sorry, I would give up this change."
110,1752,"Jun 15 2007 	could have been better	Hotel room is very roomy but the upkeep is lacking. Rooms airconditioning was not sufficient to cool the room in summer and there was no hair dryer in the room ( a feature that I expect in any american hotel).The roof top bar is nice, and worth a visit."
111,1752,"May 26 2007 	Started awful improved later on	Stayed in this hotel in mid April for 6 nights.At the beginning we were given a smoking room which was incredibly stinky so we barely could breathe there. It was also freezing though the window was closed and very very noisy (cars, trucks), and there were some dirty towels and hair in the toilet.It was also pretty small (TV was inside a closet which open door blocks the entrance to bathroom)We complained but the reception said they are sold out so they can't do anything this night, and they will try to move us to another room the next day.In the meantime, the housekeeping lady came, replaced only 1 towel (!) and sprayed some spray against smoking that helped for 10 min.Since it was impossible to stay in the room, we spent half a night walking in the street and sitting in the lobby, complaining again to every reception shift about this horrible experience.The next day the manager came and indeed moved us to a non smoking, clean , quiet and very big room with much nicer view and we stayed in this room the rest of the trip.The stay in this room was much better, the only minus was that not always housekeeping brought new soap/shampoo though the one in the room was over. Luckily, we also brought our own soap and shampoo...In overall, all rooms have an old rug that is woren and the toilet seat also seems like needs to be replaced.The location of the hotel is OK but not great - 1 min. walk from UN, it's around 49 th and 1st Ave which means about 15 min. walk to 5 th ave, and about 10 min walk to metro."
112,1752,"May 20 2007 	Loved the Beekman	WE had a lovely one-bedroom suite, that came with a tidy little kitchen. Would have been comfortable staying there for a month! They have a great exercise room, and the staff was extremly accomodating. There are tons of good places to eat closeby, but still away from the tourist traps in mid-town. Only a short walk from Grand Central, the UN, Waldorf, Saks, and many other sites. We can't wait to go back."
113,1752,"May 5 2007 	Spacious and clean	My husband and I took a short weekend getaway to NYC, and found a great deal in one of their suites on Hotels.com. Although we were on the 4th floor, with no great views of the city, we were very impressed with the size of the suite. Tall ceilings, and three large windows lined one of the walls. There was lots of open space in the living room. Furnishings were older, but tasteful. We were pleasantlysurprised with a kitchen, but it didn't get much use as we were only there for two nights. Hotel staff were friendly--no major problems. No problems with noise.Rooftop restaurant for dessert and drinks was nice, but not incredibly impressive. It was a nice place to stay, in a decent location. The hotel is about 5 blocks from 5th Avenue. It's a bit of a walk to the nearest subway. But it's NYC---you should expect to walk unless you are planning on taking taxis everywhere (which can get quite expensive). Negatives: The heaters wouldn't turn off in all the rooms. So...we left a couple windows cracked open and the temperature was fine. Bed was on the hard side--not really comfortable for us. I'd recommend the hotel suite for families or couples on a longer vacation. If you are looking for a good deal / decent and spacious place to stay this would be your place. If you are looking for luxury and amazing views, you can find better hotels to stay at in NYC."
114,1752,"Apr 30 2007 	Very Good	My wife and I have just spent a pleasant long weekend at the Beekman Tower hotel. We requested a quiet high floor and were given 24C which is near the top of the building with small balconies from the bedroom and living room. The suite was clean and well-furnished. The service was excellent although the lobby is inadequate to handle the traffic at peak times and the front desk, while efficient and courteous, was perhaps understaffed at the height of the check-in/check-out times. Even so, the staff were courteous and highly professional in coping with the situation. The location is pleasant and the immediate area seemed safe and &quot;residential&quot;, but a rather longish walk or short taxi trip to the centre of the shopping or theatre districts. In short, a good place to stay and certainly recommended if you don't need to be within shouting distance of Times Square. The building itself is of some interest and there are some excellent images and historical references to be found at [--]"
115,1752,"Apr 27 2007 	exremely impressed with beekman tower hotel	We arrived on 19th April for 5 nights. We were dealt with quickly and given the keys to our room on the 19th floor. I had advised the Hotelthat it was our 10th wedding anniversary and my husbands birthday, so they gave us a complimentary bottle of wine and fantastic views from our room!The room was big with kitchen area and bathroom etc, yes, it is slightly dated but we loved it because it was clean, spacious and cosy. We did end up with the window open as it was quite warm, however the weather was in late 70's to 80's anyway .We walked to Time Square / mid Town in around 15 mins, infact we walked mostly everywhere, only getting a taxi once, and buses ( with o metro card each) to Ellis Island, China Town, Tribecca, Ground Zero etc, so good location.Each moring we either had breakfast at the United Nations cafe opposite or got a bagel and juice 'to go' in the little shop next to cafe.On the day we left, we experienced major problems with the shuttle service 'blue bus'. This was pre paid with our holiday. They are renowned to be totally unreliable - we learned from our friendly dooeman, and unforyunately didn't bother coming to collect us as the'traffic was bad'!! An hour later and with no transport , our doorman quickly arranged the hotel car to take us. We had no dollars left, so they kindly let us have the dollars from their till with a payment on our visa - this is not done unless in an emergency.We got to the airport safely and in time - be warned don't use the shuttle, our story is one of many.Anyway, highly recommend this hotel, will not bother fining a different one if I go again, as its was great in all ways - finally the views from the cocktail bar are so great, they really are worth a visit."
116,1752,"Apr 23 2007 	Beekman Tower - Bang on!!!	Arrived at the Beekman Tower at aroun 2.00pm local time, we were swiftly checked in to our room. There was no fortunate upgrade or piece of luck that made our stay that little bit more special - we were given the exact room we'd paid for and that we were expecting.This makes this review even more positive as I believe I experienced a stay that the vast majority of travellers will relate to.We were in the east wing, 10 yards away from the main building. Our room was fine, one large double bed, a small kitchen (with possibly the World's most effective toaster) and a bathroom that although a little dated was clean and rather pleasant.For the week that we stayed there was never too much noise from the street that it interrupted our sleep and to be honest I felt really at home immediately in the little studio, far nicer than a sterile Hilton Hotel room.As a diabetic, I found a little bagel shop on 1st Avenue selling sugar free cakes that could only be described as delicious. It's a really pleasant hotel, slightly old world like and it's very cheap. I can't really recommend it any higher - stay there and you'll not be disappopinted :-)."
117,1752,"Apr 9 2007 	not a bad place - clean	not a bad place for the price - nyc is so damn expensive - so we got a great deal from travelzoo for this hotel - it is in a quiet location (at least on the weekend) - walking distance (if you're don't mind walking) - clean (no mold, no bugs) - maybe the rug was a little worn, but for that price in ny - you can live with it -- we had a small functioning kitchenette in our room which can be a big moneysaver for folks on a budget -- front desk treated us nice, even with a budget website reservation -- all in all not a bad place for the price"
118,1752,"Apr 8 2007 	Nice hotel especially for the price	This was a nice, clean hotel with a curteous and helpful staff. Our room had a queen sized bed, a full bath, and a pretty good sized kitchen in the next room. It was a little dated, but clean and the room was decent sized, especially for the city. The neighborhood was fine, and you could walk to Rockefeller center in about 15-20 minutes. It was a bit of a walk to metro stops (about 5-6 blocks), but that was only an issue when it was raining. You could also easily catch a taxi on 1st Ave, directly in front of the hotel. There was a small grocery right across the street, which was great since we had the kitchen, and a large drugstore, pizza place, and deli within 2 blocks.Overall, we had a nice stay, and were especially impressed with how nice it was for the price (we got it at about $150/night, which is great for that caliber hotel in Manhattan)."
119,1752,"Apr 8 2007 	Great Value	I booked a last minute overnight on Priceline for $139, and hadn't heard of the Beekman until my offer was accepted. We were upgraded toa HUGE suite on the 22nd floor complete with great views, an outdoor patio, kitchen, dining room, 2 bathrooms and 3 closets! We're accustomed to overpriced, TINY NYC hotels, so this was a welcome change. Although the place could use an update, I'd rather live with the furnishings from yesteryear and pay these low prices any day! The bed was comfortable, but the shower pressure was weak. One minor complaint: my husband wanted to use the room's Wi-Fi, and called downto the desk for instructions, but the woman he spoke with didn't knowwhat he was talking about. We learned that Wi-Fi use costs $10 per day -- a major ripoff. Other than that, we were very pleased. The rooftop bar was great."
120,1752,"Apr 6 2007 	Good hotel with an ok location	We stayed at the Beekman at then end of March for 5 nights. The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The location was ok, attractions are within walking distance."
121,1752,"Mar 28 2007 	Great Value and location	We booked the Beekman for 5 nights at an incredible rate for this area of Manhattan. The room was a one bedroom suite with a kitchen that was well equipped. Comfortable accommodation although a little tired.The Top of The Tower bar/restaurant, is worth a visit in the evening for a 360 degree view across the city. Expensive drinks, but you have to do it!The Nations Diner across 1st Avenue is a must for breakfast. Excellent choice for vegetarians, loads to eat and very reasonably priced. It will set you up for the day.The metro is nearby for trips further a field; China Town, Little Italy and Battery Park for the ferries to Liberty and Ellis Islands. You can also walk to the main shopping areas. However, instead of always heading west, go 1 block east to the river. You can have a wonderful view across to Queens and further south to Brooklyn.All in all highly recommended."
122,1752,"Mar 22 2007 	Great hotel great price	My husband and I took a trip to NYC to celebrate my birthday and our first wedding anniversary. I found the Beekman online and got a price of $139/nt through Travelzoo. We were very happy with the hotel- we booked a studio suite, and loved the huge kitchen and bedroom. The bathroom was small, but not terrible. Everything was spotlessly clean. The bedspread and curtains are a bit dated, but nothing out of the ordinary. The kitchen was nicely stocked with a toaster, pans, silverware, can opener, dishwasher, dishsoap, towels, plates, glasses and wine glasses. Lots of drawers and several large closets in the room as well.The front desk staff was friendly and check-in was easy. We checked out at noon on our last day and left our luggage there all day. We took a car service to an airport hotel in the evening. It cost us $65 to get to a JFK airport hotel, but we took the trip in a nice Lexus towncar, with a very friendly driver. I recommend asking the front desk about the car service if you need transport to the airport. Our only problem was trying to find the hotel on our first night there. The taxi driver didnt know where it was, and I didnt have the cross-streets. We probably went past 3 times before we found it. The sign for the hotel is small too. Take the cross-streets, not just the address! It's a great location for sightseeing. About 2 blocks from the UN, a little further from other things, but the subway is not too far away. We did a lot of walking and felt that we were in a good location to see everything. There are lots of stores and food nearby, so you will be well fed. Definitely stay there if you have the chance!"
123,1752,"Mar 14 2007 	Better than expected	Just returned from a week stay in the hotel. Everything excellent, large room, we had five windows in our studio apartment! Extremely quiet, overlooking gardens in a side part of the hotel. Only one other room on our corridor so everything was silent apart from the gurgling heater but as the room was very warm switching it off remedied this. Very clean, fresh, fluffy towels every day, fresh stocks of toiletries and tea and coffee provided daily. Full size gas cooker and good size fridge and freezer. Handy for deli, Nations cafe (good cheap breakfast) open from six am until late, wine and liquor store and frequent buses to almost everywhere. Would certainly book to go there again."
124,1752,"Mar 13 2007 	Superb Value	Got a great deal at this hotel through a Travelzoo offer and were pleased to see the room was huge and actually rather nice. Location was ok too, about a 15 minute walk from Grand Central Station and only a 7 minute walk from a nearer subway. The bar at the top of the hotel was good for a nightcap on one the of the nights we were there, with a stunning night time view over Roosevelt Island etc. Defintely recommend."
125,1752,"Mar 9 2007 	Great Place To Stay	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Beekman from Feb 27th for four nights. Having been initially disappointed with the fact that we were staying in an 'annexe' to the main hotel, (same building, different entrance doors) we were pleasantly surprised, the one bedroomed suite was excellent, very spacious, good size living room, small but adequate kitchen, good size bedroom and well stocked bathroom. Spotlessly clean, maid service every day, fresh towels and linen daily. Yes, its a 10-15 minute walk to 5th avenue, but on our return after hectic days out, it was a relief to get back to a quiet neighbourhood - removed from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Views from the Top of the Tower are spectacular - even if the bar itself is extremely expensive! From the moment you walk through the hotel doors, all the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. We would DEFINITELY stay there again - though I notice the rates have soared since we booked. Well done all at the Beekman."
126,1752,"Mar 4 2007 	Superb value for money	My partner and I stayed at the Beekman for 6 days in January 2007 for our first trip to NYC. Hotel accommodation in the city does not come cheap and when we found this hotel offering a one bedroom apartment for 5 nights for just 400 we couldn't say no. It's true that the interior isn't designed by Philippe Starck, and no, it's not on Times Square; but what this hotel does offer is space, value for money and a decent location. We were in a room on the fifth floor with a view of another building and the back gardens of some neighbours. The room was a good size with sofa, table and chairs, with a well equipped kitchen off the living room along with a bedroom with en-suite. I didn't think that the decor was that dated, it looked like a number of Marriott's I've stayed in, warm, floral colours, nothing too offensive. As other reviewers have mentioned, the Top of the Tower is a good spot for a cocktail or two, we didn't eat there but we did see the food and it looked pretty run of the mill for the prices being charged. Location-wise it is a bit of a walk into the heart of Manhatten, but we walked to Times Square in about 20 minutes. We would recommend getting a travel pass and using the public transport. A week's ticket was about $26 and gave us access to the bus and the underground. There's a bus stop directly opposite the hotel that takes you straight across Manhatten, easy! Finally it certainly looks like the Beekman's low rates have been discovered by many as when we were there the hotel was fully booked most nights. However the hotel never felt frantic and we appreciated coming back to the peace and quiet of 1st Avenue after the excitement of a day in NYC."
127,1752,"Feb 26 2007 	Good hotel soso location	This is a fine hotel, the in room facilities are very good but they could use some remodeling. Old Microwave, old stove. The room is very clean and has a very nice space if you choose the one bedroom unit. Some disappointing issues :The 1 bedroom floorplan indicated that the main room and the living room that had a sofa bed would share a bathroom that would stay in between the both rooms. Actually the bathroom were inside the main room, if our third friend had come, she would have to go into our room each time she needed to use the bathroom. The hotel has a 3 oclock check in time policy. As they were full , I had to wait untill 3 oclock to check in. It is a bit to odd to have to check out by 12:00 and check in by 3pm......The location is so, so as it is 3 avenues from the nearest subway, mind that the aveues in New York are very large and that means a lot of walking to get to the nearest subway. Friendly staff. Very nice bathroom shampoos and soap were provided."
128,1752,"Feb 13 2007 	Pleasant stay at the Beekman	We have just returned from a lovely 5 night stay at the Beekman Tower. (Negative first sorry!) Things didn't get off to the best start when we checked in however. Unfortunately - although I had requested a high floor through the booking agency (lastminute.com), and had emailed the hotel separately requesting the same, we were given a very cold room on the lowest floor possible - floor 2! The suite was nice, but had terrible views (a brick wall one side, and 1st Avenue through a frosted smeared window the other) and the bathroom and bedroom were very very cold - even with the heaters on. I reported our disappointment to reception, who advised that they could not do anything until the next day. Sure enough, we returned from being out the next day to find we had been moved to a new suite - on the 17th floor with a city view! We were very happy and very grateful with the new room, and the way that the reception staff handled the situation.Location of the hotel was fine. On previous visits to NYC, we have stayed in midtown (Waldorf Astoria, Roger Smith, The Carlton), but - although the Beekman is a little out of the way - it is not too bad. The nearest subway station - 51st and Lexington - is not too far (about a 5 minute walk - depending on how fast you are!). This is only a pain if you're tired and very cold and drunk...but then you can get a taxi (as we did)! There is a diner and a grocery store across the road, and a McDonalds(!) and Starbucks a couple of blocks away. The United Nations building is a bout a 2-3 minutes walk away. You're only about 2-3 blocks away from midtown, where everything is.The views from the &quot;Top of the Tower&quot; restaurant are great. We didn't eat there, but had drinks/cocktails one evening, which was very relaxed and enjoyable. We did get room service one night (which is from the Top of the Tower restaurant) and the food was very nice. All staff - including doormen, cleaners and waiters - were very professional and pleasant throughout our visit.I never got time to use the gym(!) or any other facilities at the hotel, so cannot comment.Rooms/suites are very spacious, clean and nicely decorated. Ours had a nice big 'living room' complete with sofa, coffee table and dining table, plus a nice size TV. The bedroom was a good size with a very comfortable large bed (and TV), and nice clean ensuite bathroom. 2 good size wardrobes - one in the bedroom and one in the 'hall' - plus an iron and ironing board were also supplied. The kitchen is equipped with a fridge freezer, microwave, coffee machine and coffee, and sufficient cutlery, plates, etc.Although the Beekman is described as a &quot;business hotel&quot;, I thought it would be suitable for all types of travellers (although probably not best for families with younger children - though suite size could be a plus point for families). Overall, I'd recommend the Beekman Tower for its large rooms, very friendly/helpful staff and amazing Top of the Tower views - but its 'out-of mid-town' location may be an issue for some travellers."
129,1752,"Feb 4 2007 	Nice stay at the Beekman	Just returned from 2-night stay at Beekman Tower with my teenage daughter. The rate was fantastic so even though the location is a few blocks from everything, it was definetly worth it. (We booked king-bedded studio suite on the Affinia site for $102/night.) We took advantage of the close proximity to the UN and went ona tour on Friday afternoon. We picked-up snacks at the convienience store across the street and had the kitchenette to store our ice cream and juice. The rooms are a bit old-fashioned, but very clean. At first, we thought the bed wouldn't be comfortable, but we both slept well. I would recommend double or king beds over twin beds! The water pressure in the shower was very powerful. We would stay there again, or try another well-priced Affinia property."
130,1752,Jan 13 2007 	Enjoyed the Beekman	Great location. Walking distance to just about anywhere. Very nice staff.
131,1752,"Jan 12 2007 	Lovely place to stay!	I stayed here with my two adult daughters and we absolutely loved the place! After a long time travelling we arrived at 9pm to be greeted with very friendly staff, so polite it was very refreshing. Particuarly the doormen. Check in was swift and our one bedroom suite was cleaned to a high standard everyday and the maid always left extra smellies for the three of us. Great cafe over the road which has already been mentioned, they serve a huge selection of breakfasts to choose from. (U.N Cafe) The Top of The Tower cocktail lounge has wonderful views of the city at night. The cocktails worked out at about six pounds each but was well worth it for the views. Again the waiters were very helpful and friendly. Location is okay if you don't mind walking, times square is about 15 - 20 mins. The grocery store over the road is handy too.(Also very friendly) There's a little pet boutique up the road which had some nice things, the gentleman who owned it was lovely and very chatty. The suite was huge and spacious by New York standards, with plenty of cupboard space with a walk in wardrobe too. Having a kitchen was great and it was stocked with all the extras you will need. Don't hesitate to stay here I am already planning to return at the same time this year.BEWARE- When we arrived at La Guardia airport we were approached by a taxi driver (not a yellow cab) offering us the whole deal for a whopping $80 inc. tip claiming we would be waiting in the queue for a yellow cab for a long time. When we actually only waited for 10 mins and only cost us $30.TIP - Do the empire state building at night there was virtually no queue! We went about 8pm, don't miss it the views are fantastic."
132,1752,"Jan 12 2007 	Great hotel!	This hotel was great! We booked an arrangement in the Netherlands for a New York city trip.We had a one bedroom suite and it really was great. There was a separate kitchen (with dishwasher) and a bathroom which was nice. The bedroom was nice too, the bed was comfortable.We had a room on the 2nd floor. We could heardly hear the noise from outside.The staff was great and helpful and provided us with toothpaste and deodorant because our suitcases didn't arrive at the same time we did.We really can recommend this hotel to you.We had breakfast at the Nations cafe across the street, the food was great!"
133,1752,"Jan 6 2007	great value wonderful neighborhood	Yes, the rooms are a little worn around the edges, but where else in Manhattan (in one of the safest neighborhoods in the city) can you have a one bedroom suite during Christmas/New Year time frame for $270 a night? The hotel was sold in November and major renovations are planned--which means big price increases in the future. For anyone who wants to focus on midtown and the upper East Side this is a wonderful choice. The customer service is superb. The housekeeping staff is wonderful. I always look at The Beekman Tower at my apartment in New York when I'm a guest in the city."
134,1752,"Dec 7 2006 	Friendly staff/ great location	We arrived at the Beekman Hotel and quickly checked in with no hassles. The doorman and receptionist were friendly and welcoming and we soon up to our room. We had a one-bedroom suite with a kitchen. First impressions were that is was tidy but a bit worn looking. The suite was set out differently to that I had seen on the Internet so that the bathroom was off of the bedroom. I was a bit disappointed with this as it meant my 13-year-old stepson would need to walk through our room to the bathroom. Also the sofa bed when pulled out blocked our pathway to the main door. But I didnt bother changing as we were only staying for 2 nights. The kitchen had a dishwasher, fridge/freezer, and cooker with hob, a toaster and a sink. A nice touch was the ice cubes in the freezer ready for your drink! In the cupboards I found some saucepans and frying pan, plates, cups and glasses, a chopping board and they had also left one dishwasher tablet, washing up liquid and a cloth. No cutlery or knives though but maybe you needed to ask for them downstairs. We didnt use the kitchen at all.The bathroom was tidy and clean except for what looked like blood splatters on the wall by the mirror, which was slightly disappointing. The range of toiletries was good (I had also noticed a sign at reception saying you could also get deodorant and contact lens solution if required.)The bedroom was an adequate size but only had enough room for one bedside cabinet. There was also a TV cabinet and a closet with a safe inside. We had breakfast at the Nations caf across the road from our hotel. The food was really nice and the service superb  I heartily recommend it.The location of the hotel was great as it was away from the main hustle/bustle but it was an easy walk to Times Square and Central Park.Heating in the room was a bit sporadic  the first night the heating stayed on until the early hours, which I found stifling, but the second night it was off quite early.We didnt use any of the hotel facilities but on our second morning we did go to the restaurant at the top of the hotel to watch the sunrise (before the restaurant was open)"
135,1752,"Nov 29 2006 	great hotel at a great rate!	this was our second time to new york city and we wanted to steer clear of all the toruisty parts of the city!! we stayed at the raddison martinique on broadway our first time around and while it was a nice hotel the price for the size of the room was a little high which is to be expected in new york. we did extensive reasearch this time around and booked at several different hotels but then canceled due to multiple bad reviews on here. we finally booked at the beekman tower which was rated at the time # 38 out of over 300 hotles on here. We got a great rate on travelzoo @ 159 a night! when we got there the first rooms they showed us to were okay about the size of our previous stay @ the martinique but the rooms were very hot and we asked if we could be relocated. they upgraded us without any hestitaition to the suites with a seperate entrance. These rooms were amaizing, while outdated, the size and cleanlyness were great. the housekeeping was also great. we were never disturbed and always had a nice cleaned room to come back to. there was a huge kitchen equipped with full fridge, sink, dishwasher and stove. our room also had a dining table. there were only two rooms per floor which was great because we were traveling with friends which also were upgraded and shared the same floor with us. we herd very little outside noise. for those who complain about street noise, you do know your in the city that never sleeps right?!? The ac worked great in the queen suits and always had a nice cool room to come back to. if you want to stay in the heart of all the attractions this is not really the place to be. but if your in the mood to just walk the city and really soak up what its like to be a new yorker this is just the place. we walked EVERYWHERE!! we even walked from the hotel to central park, while tiring, it was a great expeierience and i wouldnt trade it for anything. if walking is not the thing for your there is a subway line about 4 blocks up on lexington ave and that connects to other lines but i believe that line runs to yankee stadium if you can catch a game. the staff was very pleasant when we had contact with them but with a seperate entrance to our room we didnt really have too much contact with them. the restaraunt on top of the tower had a great view but the drinks were kinda pricey. i had a coke and it was like 8 bucks. i would recomend this hotel if its your second time around and dont want the environment of tourists all over the place. i would also reccomend seeing other sites besides times square, we ate at a great restaraunt in tribecca called the tribecca grill. this was an awsome restaraunt, while a tad overpriced, the environment of the restaraunt was worth the price. it is partially owned by robbert denero if that makes any difference. also for sports fans Mantels is an awsome place to eat. it right across from central park and has everything a yankee fan could dream of!! there is also a little grocery store right across the street and the owner is awsome!! he even yelled at the hubby cause i was gonna carry the bag out!! lol! he was great! if you want to really expierience what its like to be a new yorker this is the place for you!! i might also add that the beekman is rated higher than the waldorf astoria!!"
136,1752,"Nov 28 2006 	Would return	Stayed at the Beekman for Thanksgiving day weekend. I have to agree with most of the reviews. The people are very nice. The rooms are very clean (I think the cleaning staff should be awarded); the furniture is scuffed up and outdated, the suite itself is not very big. We had a one bedroom superior suite on the 18th floor. Not too small, but definately not big. The living room with the pull out couch was good size, but the actual bedroom with the queen bed was small, and the kitchen was tiny, but we were not doing any cooking so it didn't matter. The location was great, we could still walk to Rockefeller center plaza and times square. The restaurant on the top floor of the Beekman is definately worth going to for at least a drink. I loved that restaurant, atmosphere was so nice and beautiful!! The nations cafe across the street was great for breakfast, we went there 4 mornings in a row. The convience/market also across the street was open 24 hours and came in very handy. I really liked the location. From reading about other hotels in New York, with rooms so small and tiny for $300 +, I guess the Beekman has good size rooms, although I've only stayed in 1+ bedroom suites and would never stay in a regular room with 2 kids. We paid 279.00 a night plus tax. So compared to other hotels I guess this is a good rate. I did not like the fact that they allow pets to stay there and was nervous about that. But my room did not smell like dog, and there wasn't any dog barking at night. I did see dogs but it turned out ok, not a problem.. I would go back again."
137,1752,"Nov 24 2006	Good location decor in hotel needs help	We stayed here for one night in November 2006. We enjoyed being close to midtown and a short taxi ride from Union Square. We loved the &quot;Top of the Tower&quot; - I would definitely receommend going up there for a drink (whether you stay in the hotel or not). The staff was relatively friendly and helpful (a little slow at check in). In general, the hotel was fine for one night, but the decor of the hotel was totally beat. I felt like I was in my grandmother's house, circa 1954. The flower bedspread with matching curtains, the puke greek carpet, and the dark green furniture is all outdated. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable ones that I have ever slept on. The price for this hotel was good, so I guess for one night it was fine. But I wouldn't necessarily recommend staying there for an extended stay. A couple hints - ask the staff for a hotel on a higher floor. We were on the 2nd floor and there was a lot of street noise, especially in the morning. We also had a little kitchenette, so you can bring food/drink if you want to. Be sure to ask for extra blankets and pillows. There was one extra pillow and one extra blanket (that had holes in it) in the closet. There were only two pillows on the bed and a very thin cover."
138,1752,Nov 24 2006 	Loved It!	Myself and my husband stayed in the Beekman during the Halloween holidays and found it to be most pleasant.we were placed in a suite on the 7th floor and it was huge and spotless. Granted it could do with a decoration re vamp but the maid service was excellent and i couldnt fault the cleanliness of the room.The receptionists were always friendly and courteous and very helpfull when u needed advice on the best way to see the sights and where to eat etc.The Nations Cafe across the road served fabulous breakfasts - such a choice and value for money.All in all i would definately return to the Beekman next time we go to NY. The location is perfect if u dont want to be right in the madness of the city but close enough to walk to the sights.
139,1752,"Nov 15 2006	A Quiet Oasis	My daughter and I recently spent 2 nights at the Beekman Towers. We found it to be a secluded oasis in the midst of the Manhattan chaos. The service was impeccable, and the room clean and comfortable. Although not a flashy , upscale hotel, we found it to be quietly refreshing in a classy way. I would certainly reccomend this facilty to travelers looking for a quiet facilty away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but yet still close enough to be convenient to the major attractions of Manhattan."
140,1752,Nov 15 2006 	Love the neighborhood	The hotel is old and a little noisy. Forget that. There are much better hotels in NYC. But we loved the neighborhood. A few blocks away are a lot of nice restaurants. Filled with New Yorkers. Not with tourists. The people at the reception are very helpfull and friendly. The guys at the door are the best. They really understand how to make you feel at home.
141,1752,"Nov 13 2006 	Dissapointed	We stayed at the Beekman Tower Suites for 5 ngihts at the beginning of November.When booking with the agent I requested a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor, I also emailed the hotel direct with this request after we booked.When we arrived, we were checked into a smoking room on a smoking floor - stank as soon as the lift doors opened onto our floor!The room was very well aired and as it was the middle of the night and we were exhausted we just collapsed there for the night and then requested it was changed in the morning.The next Day the man on reception said they would find us another room and to ask him about it when we returned after our day out.When I did ask about it on our return at lunch time I was told they had given our room away as we were not packed and ready to move (everything in our rooms was packed up apart from tooth brushes).I was told there were no more rooms so we would have to stay in the one we were in.After I refused to accept that then they found us a non smoking room on a non smoking floor.The rooms were clean and comfortable but there was lots of niggly things that needed fixing in both rooms, they were just old and run down.Loose tiles on kitchen floor, curtains that don't close, broken toilet fixtures etc.The walls were very thin, could hear our neighbours coming in every morning at about 5am and continuing their partying.The coffee machine in the room was great but getting a Kettle to make Tea was a bit of a trauma as well, but we did get there in the end.We had 1 meal in the Top of the Tower restaurant, the view was great and the food was all nice although I did not get what I ordered. There was meant to be a piano player in there all night every night as well (proudly told this by reception when we checked in) but there was not a note of music in there all night.I chose the Beekman because of reviews on here but having stayed there I would not want to recommend it to anyone as there are pleanty of better places to stay in the city.It just felt that to get anything done there was a fight and that is not a holiday."
142,1752,"Nov 10 2006 	Good value for young famlly.	We stayed for 5 nights at the Beekman in August &amp; we had a very good experience. My husband, 2 children (ages 4 &amp; 2), Mum &amp; I shared a one bedroom apartment (my husband &amp; I shared the sofabed in the lounge) &amp; we found the cooking facilities (for breakfast &amp; dinners mostly) a big cost-saver. We enjoyed a beautiful dinner at the Top of the Town restaurant &amp; the service was spectacular. Ahmed the doorman was very helpful, organising a car service with child restraints for airport transfers for me. The decor is very dated &amp; the beds are quite uncomfortable, but it was remarkably quiet &amp; we felt extremely safe , even at night. There is a laundry service &amp; mini market conveniently situated across the road which was handy when you have small children."
143,1752,"Nov 7 2006 	Disappointing	I booked a suite at the Beekman to use to get ready for my wedding and as the hotel for our wedding night. I had visited the hotel before booking to check out the suites and they seemed nice, although I was obviously shown the nicest suite they have, but booked into a subpar room.I booked a Queen Suite through Quikbook. Upon my arrival, they directed me to an entrance down the street - not exactly what I had expected. Then the keys didn't work. With my wedding dress and flowers in tow, it was obvious that I was there for my wedding, and this room wouldn't do. John the bellman quickly took care of getting me a suite in the main building, and he was very pleasant and helpful with getting all of my stuff into the room.The suite was much smaller than I expected. It was also very warm - the AC was not working as well as it should. This became very obvious when my bridal party, hairdresser and makeup person came over and we were all sweating, especially now that the suite was more crowded. We had to open the windows to cool the place off.The day of my wedding was in the 60s and fairly humid. I returned to the room after the wedding to find the AC had been turned off, and the heat cranked up high! It was unbearably hot (and killed any wedding night romance!). The staff promised us a portable air conditioner which never arrived. We had to make do with a fan. We got no sleep and ended up checking out very early. It was very disappointing, as we were looking forward to having a romantic morning with breakfast in bed.The room was very outdated and needs renovations, especially when they are charging $300 a night. There were also no utensils provided in the kitchen - I had to run to the deli to get some plastic knives and forks. Also, room service will not provide wine or champagne - I had to run to a liquor store to get some celebratory champagne.I'm from NYC and I didn't mind the location, though some may be off-put by being in a more residential area. The M50/M27 crosstown bus is just across the street, which can connect you to most tourist areas or subway stops to get you around town.All in all, I was very disappointed with the Beekman. The heat was unbearable, and I didn't get any special treatment after I told them I was there for my wedding - a bottle of champagne or flowers would have been a nice touch."
144,1752,"Oct 24 2006 	Deceptive Website	Since we have been pleased with the one bedroom suites at the Beekman, we booked a studio queen suite on the website for a one night stay. We were dismayed to find a very small double bed in a room that was too small to hold a queen sized bed. The room would have been adequate for one person, but was too small for two -- small enough so that it was difficult to get into the bed. When we complained, we were told that queen suites may have either a double or queen bed, but this is not clear from the website. The room was significantly overpriced for what it was."
145,1752,"Oct 21 2006 	Fantastic hotel - great value	We stayed at the Beekman for a week at the end of September, and were thoroughly impressed from the moment we arrived. We booked our rooom through lastminute for 125 a night, which was excellent value for what we got. I can understand some reviewers who paid much more for their rooms not being quite as impressed as we were with the Beekman, it is a little dated and not in the same class as some of the big 5* hotels, but if you can get a cheap rate like we did, it really is fantastic value.Having read other reviews on this site, we asked when checking in if we could have a room on a higher floor, both to avoid street noise, and to get the great views. The staff were unbelievably helpful, and went out of their way to get a higher floor suite ready for us, even though this meant upgrading us at no extra cost (we had booked a studio suite, and were upgraded to a full suite). I would definitely recommend doing this, as the views from our room were fantastic (see pics attached). Our suite was bigger than some of the flats we've lived in in London - really amazing, and spotlessly clean, with huge living room and dining area, full kitchen, bedroom and bathroom, and loads of storage space - very handy for all the shopping! The decor is a bit dated, and the hotel is probably in need of a refurb, but considering the price we paid, we were more than happy. I'm sure if it had been refurbed it would be at least twice the price.We really liked the location, the neighbourhood was lovely, and didn't feel too busy or touristy. There are lots of great bars and restaurants right nearby on 2nd Ave, and we would definitely recommend Pescatore, a decent Italian restaurant less than 5 mis away, along with other reviewers. It was only about a 10 min walk into Mid-town, and less to the subway on Lexington, which was very handy. Also, if you're new to NYC (as we were), ask at reception for a map, which we hardly ever put down it was so useful!We had cocktails at the Top of the Tower resaurant, and it was worth it for the views (although they weren't really any better than those from our room!), but it was a bit 'cheesy', and dated. We didn't eat there though - it was quite pricy, and there are so many great restaurants nearby it didn't seem worth it.All in all we had a fantastic stay, and really can't fault the Beekman Tower at all - the staff were great, and really couldn't do enough to help, and for the price we paid, it far exceeded anything we expected. A few tips for any NYC first timers:The 'top of the rock' observation deck on the top of the Rockefeller Centre was fantastic - much less busy than the Empire State Building, and a huge roof area at the top is open, so much more space too. Views are amazing, and the building (inside &amp; out) is incredible. Also, don't miss the Anish Kapoor Sky Mirror installation which is infront of the Rockefeller centre at the moment.For any fellow Woody Allen fans, definitely go to Elaine's restaurant on the upper east side, which features in Manhatten and various other of his films, really great service, nice 'homely' food, although we were a bit disappointed not to see the man himself! Also, Riverview Terrace where Woody and Diane Keaton watch the sun come up togther in Manhatten is just a few blocks up from the Beekman Tower, by the Queensboro bridge, and a great photo op!As for shopping, you can't do better than Century 21 (opposite the WTC site) - amazing high end designer clothes so cheap it's mind boggling."
146,1752,"Oct 13 2006 	comfortable hotel in a residential neighborhood	Just returned from 3 nights at the Beekman Tower. I was very tired of spending $300 a night at midtown hotels for a room the size of a cell, or inhabited by seemingly thousands of fellow travelers. This hotel offers a lovely respite from the intensity of NYC, in a residential neighborhood, although the location near the UN may not be ideal if you need to be midtown. However it is at 49th street, so far enough uptown for me. Cabs are readily available at all hours. My little suite was like an apartment complete with living room, couch, TV, complete galley kitchen, and bedroom and bath. Clearly in need of renovation, however immaculately clean, complete with high end toiletries. A nice sized fitness center, and the staff is unfailingly helpful and polite. I felt extremely comfortable here, and would return, especially if staying for more than one night. At $250 a night, a great weekday value."
147,1752,"Oct 6 2006 	Good hotel good location	We stayed at the Beekman Towers at the end of a touring holiday taking us from Boston thru New England then onto Niagara Falls before getting a train to New York. We were mainly sightseeing in New York and we wanted a reasonably priced hotel in a convenient location. The Beekman seemed to fit the bill in theory and surpassed our expectations in reality.We were very impressed with the friendly and helpful staff. It was in a pretty good location - convenient for subway (under 10 min walk). 10 to 20 min walk to many points of interest - 5th Ave / Broadway / Times Square / Central Park. We had 1 bed suite (which included separate kitchen / longe area) on the 9th floor. Kitchen had fridge/freezer, dishwasher, microwave. We would have given the hotel an excellent rating (rather than good) if the rooms had a 'newer' feel - they looked slightly 'tired' and could have benefited from some re-decoration - although to be fair, everything was very clean and tidy. Can't comment on the food in the hotel as we ate out for both breakfast and dinner - as there were many good restaurants nearby. The 'Top of the Tower' cooktail bar on 26th floor was excellent - good views and friendly staff. We would defintely stay here again.We booked thru Skoosh (first time we had tried them) - and everything was handled very well - and very good price for the room - far cheaper than booking direct with the hotel."
148,1752,"Oct 3 2006 	spacious digs in NYC	We stayed at the Beekman Towers for 4 nights in April 2006. It was walking distance to many restaurants and seemed to have a lot of locals and internatioinal visitors (it's next to the U.N.) in the area. Our room was basically a 1 bedroom apartment with a separate living area (including sofa bed) and kitchen. It was not luxurious, but very clean and had absolutely everything you needed - desk, coffee table, 2 TVs, 2 closets.We couldn't get the radiator to work quite right, but it was OK because the windows opened. We didn't need to call the hotel to help us out, we just regulated the temperature by opening and closing the windows! There was a nice breeze our entire stay :) The hotel is in kind of a quiet area so noise wasn't an issue.It wasn't super close to any of the major attractions, but central to everything. Central Park one day, Yankee stadium the next, nightclub in the Meatpacking District, play on 42nd street (Awake and Sing! was an excellent drama), shopping in Chinatown. Next visit, we'll hit the museums and maybe Shea Stadium :)We loved the convenience of sandwiches at the little market across the street (we couldn't find any restuarants open late Sunday night near the hotel), and the Indian restaurant about a block away. We had a drink in the bar on the top floor, just to enjoy the view.We booked last minute and paid over $300/night but the Beekman Tower is a steal at any price below $200."
149,1752,Sep 30 2006	Very Bad	Horrible experience here- I had stayed at other Affina hotels and I thought that they were a great deal. It is clear that they have not updated this place in a very long time. The carpet was dirty and had burn marks in it. The room smelled old and like smoke. Not convenent to a subway. And worst of all there is no lighting in the rooms- I felt like I was in a cave!
150,1752,"Sep 27 2006 	In a word -- appalling	I spent two horrible nights in the Beekman during the United Nations General Assembly, a time when the hotel was packed and also chose to hike its nightly rate to $409 (before tax). They put me in the East Wing, which is part of the same building but has a separate entrance. I opened to door to my ground floor junior suite and was almost knocked over by the stale smell. The room was not particularly clean. The next thing to strike me was the noise. My room backed onto the main air conditioning system, which produced a level of noise you normally hear in the cramped berths of passenger ferries. I went to the front desk and reminded them that I'd requested a quiet room. &quot;The only ones we have left are on 1st Avenue and they're horrifically noisy,&quot; admitted the woman behind the desk with a smile. I did not sleep well that first night. I slept even worse the second night because the lower sheet was too small for the bed and kept riding up as I tossed and turned. I couldn't even seek relief in the restaurant the next morning because although it was supposed to open at 7, when I got there at 7.45 it was still shut because of &quot;staffing problems&quot;. The doors opened shortly afterwards and the first thing I saw was two of the staff arguing. Staffing problems is right. My total bill for two nights and two mediocre breakfasts was more than $1,000. I will never return to this decrepit hotel, which needs a major renovation and a complete change in attitude."
151,1752,"Sep 23 2006 	Go Beekman Go!	After trawling through countless hotel reviews, the Beekman Tower hotel appeared to have the best balance of quality and cost. I can happily report that my wife and I were not dissappointed. Everything lived up to expectations. Very pleasant and good size room for NY, with a handy little kitchen to boot! All was clean and in good condition. The rooftop bar is great for sundowners with views over the city. The location is slightly off the beaten track, close to the UN buildings, but it's an easy walk to Lexington Ave metro stations. (About 4 to 5 blocks).Great stay all round. Our room was on the lower floors and therefore had no view (we stared out at the wall of the adjoining building!). Would suggest requesting a room on the higher floors if you'll be spending a lot of time in the room."
152,1752,"Sep 5 2006 	Off the Beaten Path in a Good Way	I had my wedding at the restaurant at the top of the Beekman and stayed at the hotel for several nights, as did many members of my extended family. The staff was very helpful and accomodating and I was very satisfied with the rooms. You have to remember that this is NYC, and in any major city, unless you are staying at the Ritz, the rooms are going to be somewhat older/smaller than in smaller towns. That being said, I think the rooms are perfectly adequate, and were very clean. I also like that the hotel is a bit further away from the Times Square/theater district. It makes it much quieter and less aggravating, and it is just a short cab/subway ride away from any attraction that you might care to see. The restaurant on top of the hotel was very pretty and had an art deco theme. There are several other nice restaurants reasonably close to the hotel. I would definitely stay here again."
153,1752,"Aug 17 2006 	Wonderful Place in NYC	My wife and I have stayed at the Beekman several times and have always loved it!It has a nice, cozy, friendly feel to it. It has a rooftop restaurant which is a wonderfully romantic place to escape to at night (admittedly, expensive, but hey, it's New York). On the upper floors, it is quiet.The rooms are large and you can book a suite with a kitchen. This Summer, we stayed there with two teenagers (17 and 15). The one bedroom suite with a hide-a-bed and rollaway was perfect (particularly for the price!). In addition, we saved on some of the NYC-sticker shock by having breakfasts and snacks in the room.We did have a problem with the air conditioning on one visit (not the most recent), but we have not had any issues with the service and they tried to fix it (the air conditioning in the living room worked, so we just slept there on that visit).The location is a bit off center, but New York City is fairly large and it seems like most places are close to some things and far from others. The UN is handy (of course, unless your a diplomat there are only so many times you can go there). In the end in NYC, it always seems like you end up walking a lot. On the plus side, right across the street there are a deli/grocery store and a liquor/wine store.This is a great place for couples, groups of friends and families! I agree with the people who have commented that it probably isn't the best place for a single business traveler. We noted the oddity about the phone/fax machine that one of the reviewers has mentioned (but who uses those now?) and they don't have a business center.We'll definitely return!!"
154,1752,"Aug 7 2006 	Great Place to Stay	I travelled to New York with my two children aged 13 and 18 and was hoping for a comfortable base to explore the city. I found the Beekman Towers to be everything I had looked for. The hotel was easy to find on foot. It is about 10 mins walk from Grand Central Station. The suite was beautifully furnished and very comfortable with plenty of space ( we got a free upgrade on arrival). The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would certainly rebook if we find ourselves in New York again.There is a nice all day restaurant across the road (Nations Cafe) which has a great breakfast menu.The only note of caution - think twice before using the hairdryer provided, it blew a fuse in the suite and when I rang reception they knew it had been the hairdryer before I told them!Ruth - Dublin , Ireland"
155,1752,"Jul 25 2006 	Great for family stay	Beekman Tower is a great choice for families of three or more that need to stay at a suite at a reasonable rate. We booked through their website and got a very competitive rate. The one bedroom suites are amazingly roomy and come with a kitchen. This hotel has not been renovated in a few years but is still very clean and cozy. If you are just looking for a room, you will probably find better choices at other hotels. It is right next to the UN and a 15 minute walk to the nearest subway station-some people might decide that the 15 mintue walk is too much-we found it to be perfect because the walk is through a very beautiful residential neighborhood. You might want to consider the bus since you get to see the city while getting to your destination. There are three bus routes that pass by the hotel. There are a number of great restaurants within 4 blocks of the property. The rooftop bar offers great views...go there for a drink but avoid the food...not worth it."
156,1752,"Jul 21 2006 	2 star hotel	This is a two star hotel not a four star! Wery old and sad rooms. We changed room during our stay but they was al the same. Hotel decides what temperature its in your room and they like it warm...Ok, its cheap and our one bed room suite was very big. Location is a litle bit off. We moved to Crowne Plaza at the U.N. after four nights. Smal rooms but up to date. Clean. Effective air-condition."
157,1752,"Jun 27 2006	I wish I could say I hated it	But I can't. For anyone traveling to NYC, you definitely need to give this hotel a try.My weekend trip to NYC started out badly. Some idiot state cop in some podunk Catskill town with nothing better to do decided he was going to hassle us because my travelling partner was african american. Fortunately, as disturbing as that incident was, if ended fine and that was the only bad part of the trip.Once arriving at the Beekman, things could not have been better.The Beekman is right at the corner of 1st avenue about 2 blocks north of the UN. This puts it at about a 3 block walk to the nearest Subway station but the streets seems safe and clean even at odd hours. The front-of-house staff was nice and very accomodating. We had reserved a junior Suite but because we also wanted a smoking room, we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. We were told we needed to exit the building, go up one entrace to the &quot;E&quot; tower and take that elevator up to the 5th floor. The &quot;lobby&quot;/entranceway to &quot;E&quot; tower is a bit stark (Scary might be a better term) but then the elevator opens with a bright blue and stainless steel gleam. We took the elevator to our so called &quot;room&quot;. An Apartment would have been a better description. The room was HUGE by any standard and absolutely cavernous by New York Standards. You entered through a brief hallway that opened up into a living room almost larger than mine at home. Off to the left was a small breakfast nook and to the left of that, a complete (and spotless) galley kitchen complete with stove, full-sized fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and sink. Utensils were utilitarian (Corning Corelle dishes) but all were perfectly clean. A toaster was hidden in one of the many cabinets and a couple saucepans and a frying pan were above the sink. Just off the living room was the single bedroom. It only contained a single full-sized bed but the couch in the livingroom was a pull-out bed. (I did hear that they charge $30 for a roll-away) The bath is small, but a nice fit. I was even able to find on-street parking right in front of the hotel.There is a small corner grocery right across the street and a more full-sized grocery a few blocks away. The formal hotel restaurant was closed for a private function, but Smith and Wollensky's steakhouse was only about 2 blocks away. Smaller, less formal places abound in that area. All-in-all a very clean, very large and VERY reasonably priced room. The only thing the Beekman lacks is location. We returned to Upstate NY very pleased with our stay (and taking care NOT to go through the Catskills) The trip was quicker through Scranton anyway!"
158,1752,"Jun 26 2006 	a pretty good deal!	I stayed at the Beekman Tower for several days in June 2006 for about $250/night (inc. taxes)--a pretty good deal in NYC these days, sadly. The hotel is in a safe, residential neighborhood, a stone's throw from the UN and Trump Tower. (If you're looking for a trendy neighborhood, this isn't your hotel.) There's a kitchenette in every room, and there's a deli across the street and a decent grocery a few blocks away; the food court at Grand Central station is in walking distance. I didn't try the room service, the newish restaurant, or the gym (I didn't actually know they had a gym til I got there). The service was very friendly and housekeeping kept the place very clean. I asked for a newspaper to be delivered, which they forgot to do, but not a big deal.I was by myself, so the room was big enough, with a comfy bed and a choice of hypoallergenic, wheat or feather pillows. There's a large closet, with double mirrors, an iron and ironing board, and more than enough wooden hangers (yeah!). The room could have used a sofa and a desk, but there was a dining table w/4 chairs and a comfy chair; I rearranged the room and used the bedside table as a small table and sat in the comfy chair. The kitchen was well-stocked, with a mini-microwave, some pots and pans, coffee maker, fridge, and a toaster, all within reach for short me. The a/c is adjustable, and the windows opened (another yeah).A couple of quibbles. They had no nonsmoking rooms in the main tower, so they put me in the 2nd tower, which has an entrance several doors from the reception area, so it felt a bit isolated. The room could use some spiffing up, esp. the carpet, visibly worn in several places, and the ceiling, ditto. The toilet wouldn't flush unless you held the handle down for a while, and there was a mildewy mat stuck to the bathtub floor, with a second (not much cleaner) mat to toss over it. The kitchen light worked only when turned off and on several times, and the gauze curtains could use a serious cleaning--better yet, a discarding. other than those problems, however, I'd definitely recommend the BTH!"
159,1752,"Jun 19 2006	Beekman . . . it's great man!	I defy anyone to get a better hotel for the price in NYC. This wonderful art deco building has a great cafe/grill and the top of the tower restaurant gives breathtaking views whilst enjoying a meal or a cocktail.The first thing you will notice is the friendly staff at check-in. And I mean friendly. A frequent visitor to NYC, most of the time staff treat you like a bad headache. Beekman's staff are superb. We had a 3rd floor suite, twin bedroom, spacious lounge and lovely lounge with a super fold out bed. Again, for Manhattan an amazing floor space for the price and the rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean.You are only a 5 minute walk to NYC's most vibrant area - the bar's and restaurants on 2nd avenue are a world away from the rip off's in Time Square. The hotel's location may seem a little distant. I would say it is Manhattan's best location. A 7 dollar taxi or short walk to the Waldorf Hotel to catch the tour bus and Manhattan is your's to explore, knowing you can return to a quieter 'oasis' at Beekman Tower.Great value, enjoy your stay."
160,1752,"Jun 1 2006	Excellent Service Better than Expected!	Loved the personal attention! Stayed for 7 days. Checked in and got 3rd floor right below a bus stop, which was rather noisy as the buses pulled away. Room was nice but decided that a higher floor would be better. Front desk called right after we checked in and we asked if they had a higher floor. He said that the hotel was sold out for the night but they would try to find another room for us tomorrow. We were pleasantly surprised when they called the next morning and moved us to the 15th floor. The room was much larger and very quiet. This particular room had a table for dining which we also used for our computers. What made this hotel stand out for us, besides the size of the room, was the friendly service we received. Everyone was very helpful and attentive to all our needs. They made our first trip to New York City a wonderful experience. We would, with no hesitation, stay at the Beekman again!"
161,1752,"May 3 2006	The Beekman Sauna!!	Stayed at the Beekman Hotel for 3 nights because of the rave reviews on this site. There is a however a fundamental problem about this hotel which does not get a mention. The heating and air con system in the rooms is not adjustable at all and your therefore can not turn off the heating and the air con if it exists, does not work when the heating system is on. I complained about this and was told that &quot;the system is very old and is controlled centrally and depends upon the complaints of guest as to whether it is on or off&quot;  This is New York believe it or not!!  I ended up placing copies of the New York telephone directory over the airvents to reduce the heat output, having concluded that the noise after opening the windows was unbearable.  Apart from that, the hotel was acceptable but in need of a refurb, which I suppose is reflected in the discounted price on offer. The staff were friendly and helpful . The location is fine with lots of good restaurants nearby."
162,1752,"May 2 2006	Wonderful stay...	My first stay in Beekman Tower: great rooms, smal kitchen but with dishwasher and coffe machine daily refilled.A bath a little small but overall very clean= .Housekeeper efficient.Desk agents very friendly and the restaurant (in the lobby) is not so expensive and food is of a good quality.Two tv in the room made us happy one in front of the bed the other near the couch: excellent comfort even at 11 floor the sight was poor but nights are very very silent.I reccomend this hotel.Warning to tourists ( as i was) : the closest subway station is about 500 mt far so keeep in mind whe planning you visit."
163,1752,"Apr 30 2006	Where did all the helpful people go?	After reading all the reviews on Trip Advisor, I thought the hotel and staff would be fabulous. They weren't, although my experience was more average than horrible. To start they couldn't check me in early, saying that this East side hotel in a residential neighborhood completely sold out on the night before, a Wednesday. I find that hard to believe but I didn't say anything because they really don't have an obligation to accomodate me. I told them I had a teleconference in a few hours and asked if they had a business center. They said they didn't, and the conversation ended there. Absolutely no offer of help. However, the bellman (Henry?) saw my predicamant and told me where the nearest Kinko's is. One other point of how unhelpful the desk staff was is that when asked about amenities that were printed in black and white in the hotel guide in my room they treated me like I was making things up. In several places it said, &quot;Your room is equipped with a printer/copier/fax machine,&quot; and &quot;All suites are equipped with a printer/copier/fax machine,&quot; along with instructions on how to use it. When I called down to ask about this (my room was a suite) I was told both that my suite wasn't big enough to be equipped with one, and that they took them out of all suites a while back. And when I went down to the restaurant for lunch during the hours printed in the guide, it was closed and the desk staff said that the hours were for room service (which is provided by the diner across the street). Overall, I'd like to know where all the helpful, friendly people are. Also, a fair warning to business travelers or people who might need to do any work at all: this hotel is not geared toward business travelers."
164,1752,"Apr 26 2006	Wonderful!	We stayed at the Beekman Tower for a long weekend at the end of April. We can only agree with the other reviews.The suite (6 C) was huge. We were expecting a large suite but this was really more than expected. It included a full kitchen that even had a dish washer (and yes: detergent was included). It had a master bathroom and a separate half bath. The staff was nice in a sincere way. No problem checking out a couple of hours after check-out time. The only thing that we were less happy about was that our room was on the 6th floor. We had requested a higher floor. However, the bedroom window was turned towards a quiet street so after closing the doors to the bathroom and living-/dining room we hardly heard any traffic."
165,1752,"Apr 17 2006	Good for a family	My family and I stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel for 8 days just before Easter Sunday. We were three adults and two teenagers, so we had two rooms, with connecting doors. The rooms were small,especially with a rollaway in one of them, but each had a kitchen and a bath, which we needed. Probably could have used another bathroom at times. Housekeeping was good; rooms cleaned and fresh towels every day.The heat was uncomfortable for sleeping until we realized that the windows could be opened (with much effort). The elevators were efficient, considering that the hotel is 26 stories high, and full. But those with a view said it was great. Public transportation right in front of the hotel,the neighborhood is upscale, the staff is pleasant and helpful and we'd probably try to stay there again when we need to.Tip: Don't miss the view from the 26th floor. Makes it all worth while."
166,1752,"Apr 6 2006 	Amaing Value!	This was my second time to stay with the Beekman Tower!, and again, it was excellent! I arrived late in the evening, but was given an upgrade to a HUGE Suite, that was not only spacious, but very nice, with great views of Midtown, and the East River(16th. floor). Everyone from the front desk(Michael, and the other front desk agents), to housekeeping, to the restaurant was really great and friendly. I love their staff!! I love this hotel, it's location, and THE FACT THAT IT IS LOCATED IN THE MOST AMAZING CITY ON EARTH, NYC, WHICH I WILL BE MOVING TO THIS FALL! I highly recommend this hotel!"
167,1752,"Mar 27 2006 	Good value a little out of the way	I stayed here several days on a business trip, paying about $180 thru Hotels. The room was huge and included a kitchenette which I used for breakfast and midnight snack. Housekeeping and reception was outstanding.One obvious drawback: the hotel is not especially well-located for a business trip, although except in rush hour the crosstown bus (stops less than 1 block from hotel) is quick. The nearest subway stop is several blocks, not something to do with luggage.One disappointment: the mattress was well past its prime."
168,1752,"Mar 18 2006	Not too bad	After hearing bad reviews on this site about another hotel we made reservations at, I decided to give this hotel a try. The reviews were good, but the main thing was the price. No, it's not the Waldorf, but for $165. a night, I was not complaining. The staff was very nice. There was this one bellman who was always extra nice to us. When I left they asked if everything was to my liking. It was nice to have someone be nice to you when it seems the whole city is either rude or very impatient (I had a street vendor in China Town call me &quot;stupid&quot; because I wanted to open up his t-shirts to see what they looked like). I know the city is fast paced, but when it seems like no one in New York cares, the Beekman's staff seemed to always smile when we walked into the doors. The housekeeping was great too. They even washed the dishes once for us. The room was very quiet! We were in the corner and I only heard the people next door to us once when they closed the door. Having a room quiet is very important for me. I booked our trip with a well known website and the pictures they showed us didn't look like the room we got. The kitchen was smaller, as was the bathroom. I liked having a kitchen because we bought cereal from a market around the corner and ate in our room every morning. For cost reasons, this is the way to go. The location was nice.....right next to the United Nations and it was mostly residental. I requested a high floor the day before we checked in and I got the 12th floor out of 26 floors. I also took the advice of a previous guest and told them that it was an anniversary and they left us a nice note and some chocolates and Pelligrino water. Nice gesture. Overall, I would recommend this nice hotel, and I am a picky person. Believe me, I don't recommend places often."
169,1752,"Mar 18 2006	BEEK-tacular! Superb stay at the Beekman Tower	I have to say, researching NYC hotels before booking on Expedia.ca really paid off. Because I read all the TripAdvisor Beekman reviews, there were no surprises. These reviews give you a really good idea of what to expect. My wife and I stayed for 4 nights/5 days, which worked out to about $200 Canadian per night. I'll try to summarize some highlights:1. We arrived at the hotel about 5 hours before check-in time, and yet they gave us a room right away. 2. Our room was quite large. Not as large as some of the other descriptions on this site, but it still exceeded our needs. 3. What a bonus to have a kitchen in your NY hotel suite! (see picture). The kitchen came equipped with a mini-fridge, oven, stove-top, dishwasher, plates/bowls, microwave oven, and knives/forks/spoons (among other things). It was nice to have a coffee-maker as well, which was stocked with ground coffee bean packets. There is even an ironing board and iron. 4. I did not expect to get a room safe free of charge. 5. The lobby makes a great first impression (see picture), and our room was nice and clean. 6. Hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating. Hats off to the door-men and desk-staff, who knew we had questions before we even asked them.7. I loved the location. The hotel is East of midtown, so you're quite close to many of the major NYC sights. Aside from the UN headquarters, you're close to the Chrysler building (see picture) and Grand Central Terminal (see picture). I don't quite understand other reviewers who say the Beekman is 'out of the way'. Grand Central is about a 10 minute walk away (or less), and no more than 15 minutes to Times Square. It would be even faster if there weren't so many red lights getting in the way. If you don't like lots of walking, then you should reconsider NY as your trip destination. I'm not sure how one could truly experience NY without exploring by foot.8. Our flight left in the evening, so we inquired about the check-out process. Front desk said they could add a couple of hours to our check-out time, which was nice - but we didn't need to do this. We just checked out early, and had the staff safely store our luggage in the lobby (something I had read about here). I can't really think of anything negative about the Beekman that sticks out in my mind. I will mention that food in the hotel is overpriced, but that's no surprise. They leave a room-service menu in your hotel room, and everything is abusrdly expensive (they add on different charges in addition to the cost of the food items). I should also mention that we were hardly in our room. Typically we left the hotel by 7:30AM, and would be back by 10PM. So if there were other problems, perhaps we weren't around long enough to discover them - but I doubt it. Other tips not relating directly to the Beekman: * There is a free walking tour of Grand Central Terminal every Wednesday at 12:30PM at the info kiosk - it's 1 1/2 hours long, and very thorough. * Go to the ticket kiosk at Duffy Square (which is in Times Square) to get big discounts on Broadway shows (mostly Off-Broadway shows) - we got 50% off Slava's SnowShow and 50% off the Altar Boyz - but you can only purchase for 'day-of' performances. * There are many cheap or free performances at Juilliard. * Try to visit the Empire State Building just before the sun sets - this way you can see Manhattan during the day and at night (the nighttime view is spectacular).* Don't waste your time or money with the CNN studio tour. It is a let-down, and you don't see much of anything (they mostly have you watch a bunch of videos).* If you want to save some money, and your flight is at LaGuardia, you can take public transit. Just look for the M60 bus - it costs $2 per person in change (they do not take bills). Once you're at 125th St., you can get off at Lexington Ave. - head southbound/downtown on the Lexington subway line (you have to pay another $2 each) and get off at 51st St. or Grand Central Terminal. Now you just have to walk East for about 10-15 minutes along 49th street before you arrive at the Beekman. Taking public transit may not be for you if you have a lot of luggage. Also, the transfer you make at 125th and Lexington did not feel like the safest place (it is Harlem afterall). I'm not sure you'd want to be there at night waiting for the bus or subway. And the M60 bus is quite full during rush hour."
170,1752,"Mar 10 2006 	Best Value in New York City	I used to have to travel to NYC on a regular basis and the Beekman quickly became my favorite place to stay. Spacious, affordable suites, great staff, good location and I love the Art deco style. For the business travler, you don't feel isolated as the suites are like aprtments. The staff is super helpful as I did a lot of interviewing and held meetings there.The also have a 13th floor which I found cool. The bar upstairs has amazing views of the river and Manhattan."
171,1752,"Mar 10 2006	convenient	There's nothing I can really rave about or complain about when it comes to the Beekman. I stayed over a 4 week period in Jan-Feb 2006 as I was in NY on long business trip. I needed an apartment-hotel and I got an apartment-hotel!The room I had on the 8th floor was huge. It was bigger than most apts I have seen in NY - huge living/dining room, lots closet space, etc. For the price ($199 USD - special government employee rate - I think!), it was well worth it. Having a full kitchen (stove, microwave, fridge, dishwasher, toaster, cutlery, dishes, etc.) was a definite plus. The old green carpet and classic old furniture was ok. Two television sets (one in bedroom, one in L.R.) with a good selection of channels was also pretty good. The service was not bad. I never received a newspaper in the morning but a Newsweek would appear in my room once a week. The cleaning service was done daily and impecably. I just wish they didn't shut the armoir holding the TV everyday - but I never said anything. The front desk service was also ok. The gym onthe 2nd floor was small (coverted hotel room!) but had the necessities. There weren't a lot of users so I was able to do my thing without too many hassles.What did I not like? I hated being in Midtown East Side. There is really nothing going on there... Except the for the sketchy Deli across the street with over a dozen security cameras (there were always a bunch of Asian guys in suits whispering in a corner of the store), there isn't much action in the UN diplomatic area of Manhattan. The restaurant on the top floor had great views but was too expensive for the quality and service. I ate there once! I had bad wireless internet service for a couple of days and the tech support was not of great help but that isn't really the hotel's fault... I guess that's all I can say other than it was worth the price but I think I would rather stay at better located and nicer hotels next time..."
172,1752,"Mar 10 2006	Great Hotel	Having read so many good revievs on this hotel on this site I was still impressed with the level of service provided by the staff at The Beekman Towers. we spent four nights there and while the first two were in a different suite on the bottom floor which was spacious but dark. I complained about a noise that woke me on the second night and as they explained to me that it was the heat and probably would happen again set us up in a slightly smaller (but more standard) room on the 15th floor. Beautiful view and very comfortable bed ( i was 7 1/2 mths pregnant) Pillows galore, they have several kinds to choose from. Very courteous doormen and wonderful cafe/deli across street that had great food at reasonable prices. The kitchenette was huge and we used it to heat leftovers from the night before when we were just too tired from seeing all the sights to go out again. What a life saver!! Pregnant as I am it was not that bad a walk to all the sights on times square and Rockefeller Center. All in all if and when we go back it will be to the beekman! Highly recommended! Not fancy but Comfortable!"
173,1752,"Mar 2 2006	Hidden Gem	I stayed at the Beekman Tower in Mid-February. When I'm in Manhattan I always try to stay at hotels on the East side of town, it tends to be a little quieter there.The Beekman is a great art deco building and I was able to get a mini-suite for two nights. The decor in the room is a little old. For instance, in the sitting room area, the carpet was a little worn as was the sofa-bed. However, everything was clean and fairly well-maintained. The staff is first-rate. They are prompt with their assistance and very friendly.I also had the advantage of a nice view of the East River from the 18th floor.The Beekman may be a little out of the way for some (1st Ave. a couple blocks up from the UN), but if you like a part of Manhattan that is less crowded and less hectic, the Beekman is the way to go."
174,1752,"Feb 22 2006	A Fantastic Friendly Hotel	We've just returned from 4 nights at the Beekman, and I can't sing it's praises enough!The hotel is in a great location near the United Nations. Our room had beautiful views over the East river, and there are plenty of amenities nearby - a handy little grocery store across the street, a broad range of lovely restaurants and delis a short walk away, and only 10 minutes stroll from Rockerfeller, 5th Ave and Grand Central Station. It's all really close, yet it's far enough away to feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle of NY.The hotel lobby is decorated in an art-deco style. Fresh flowers and chilled music really added to the ambience of the place, making it feel welcoming on arrival.We had a 2 bedroom suite for 4 people. Both bedrooms were a good size - one with a double bed and large bathroom, the second with a massive king size and slightly smaller bathroom. A well equipped kitchen area and good sized dining space, plus a good sized seating area and a very comfortable sofa bed in the lounge. There was also an additional small bathroom in the hallway. The beds were very comfortable and they offer a range of pillows for your comfort.The decor is more traditional than chic and modern, but tastefully done (if a tiny little bit worn around the edges on the sofa, for example). But the room was very clean and housekeeping excellent. Staff were very professional and nothing was too much trouble. Housekeeping was very good (toiletries very nice!), and they were happy to help with anything we asked and were friendly at all times. The complimentary wine and chocolates were also a lovely touch!Other reviewers have mentioned problems with windows and heating. We found the lounge area a little cold, but mainly because it was such a large space! The windows we found fine, although a little stiff, needing two of us to open them. But no problems with noise.The cocktail lounge at the top is lovely, especially in summer, I imagine. In winter though, with the windows closed, not as special as I'd hoped! The cocktails were good, but the menu limited (wine list good though) and at $14 a cocktail, we thought pricey but is apparently going rate in NY (we found drinking expensive wherever we went!).Overall, a great hotel, especially for a slightly longer stay, as the kitchen makes catering for yourselves a handy convenience."
175,1752,"Feb 17 2006	Tremendous Value	My wife and I stayed at the Beekman for 4 nights starting Feb 11th. We stayed in a 1 Bedroom suite on the 17th floor which was definately worth the 115 per night rate. The room was fantastic and clean with a huge sitting room, and a bedroom with a great corner view of 1st Ave/50th Street. The Kitchen was very useful and well stocked with appliances (Microwave, dishwasher, cooker etc). The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. As has been said it is a few blocks to the 51st Street/Lexington subway but it only takes about 10 minutes to walk there (if that). The UN building is a within easy walking distance of the hotel, which is why I guess lots of diplomats stay there. Diagonally opposite the hotel is a great diner which serves excellent breakfasts. There is also a small grocery store opposite the hotel. I also found a much larger grocery store on 2nd Avenue, only a two minute walk from the hotel. All in all an excellent hotel, a real bargain, in a quiet but upscale neighbourhood."
176,1752,"Jan 17 2006	Perfect place to stay in NY	I booked this hotel after reading reviews on various websites, including tripadvisor. It is a fantastic hotel, I can't think of a bad thing to say about it. The postition is fantastic. The subway is not really that far from the hotel, and we found we didn't use it much anyway as the hotel is walking distance from some of the main attractions. The room was HUGE by New York standards. The room was cleaned to perfection every day.... the cleaners even folded clothes that we had left out to dry!!! The room/hotel facilities are fantastic and the Top Of The Tower bar is a must. The view is superb as are the drinks. The hotel staff were amazing, always helpful, friendly. Everytime you would walk through the door they would ask how you were or wish you a nice day. I stayed there when the transport strike was on and they were so helpful with any information needed. I honestly can't say enought about how great this hotel is. I would recommend it to anyone!!"
177,1752,"Jan 4 2006	Needs an Update Good Service	We spent a night during Christmas week at the Beekman Towers. While we were impressed by the service, the rooms are dated and do not expect the most comfortable furnishings. In particular, our queen bed (which seemed a bit smaller than that) was extremely uncomfortable and provided for less than a restful night of sleep. The bedding was also not desirable - a thin blanket that you would see at a lesser property. Also, there was some street noise due to the age of the windows. On the plus side, although the bedroom was tiny, the separate living/dining room was great for the kids to spread out and enjoy. The service was quick and friendly. The kitchen was adequate.I don't think we would rush back to the Beekman. However, if you're looking for a large space at a good rate, you may want to consider it."
178,1752,"Dec 31 2005	Huge rooms great for a family!	We stayed at the Beekman Tower for two nights the week after Christmas. We found great room rates through Travelzoo and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the suite for under $200 a night. We had a 1 bedroom suite which was great since we were traveling with our 9 year old. You can grab a few food items from the small, but pricey, grocery accross the street and the suite has a nicely equipped kitchen. Also on the same street are numerous quaint resaurants, wine shops, and even a McDonalds and Starbucks (necessities for both the 9yo and the adults!)The location is a bit off the beaten path but after the crowds at Rockefeller Cntr. and Times Sq. it was a nice break. Do be warned that the building is old and the windows let in a lot of street noise ( maybe this would be less if you were on a higher floor). All in all a great place to stay, especially if you are traveling with family!"
179,1752,"Dec 25 2005	Typical Affinia hotel and that's good	Had a one-bedroom suite here for $159 per night via Expedia, which was an excellent value. Same accomodation was $309 through the hotel's own reservation desk. Shop around before you book. The hotel told me they could not match the Expedia price.Rooms were spacious and very clean. Large living/dining room with a work desk, dining table and four chairs, sofabed/couch, TV, and one chair that wasn't especially comfortable. Bedroom was small but fine, with a soft bed and a choice of pillow types. TV and remote in the bedroom, along with a clock radio. Bathroom was oddly configured but good, with excellent water pressure, adjustable shower head and usual amenities. Kitchen was fully equipped with stove, full-size refrigerator, microwave and dishwasher, as well as table settings and silverware for four, along with cooking utensils. Complimentary coffee and tea were supplied with coffeemaker and toaster. There were two large closets.Two cautions about this hotel -- it is a remote location in a mostly residential neighborhood. The 49th Street crosstown bus stops just across the street and it's very handy to navigate those long blocks running east and west. It's a hike to the nearest subway and to most of the midtown attractions. There's a small deli/grocery across the street with uniformly high prices on everything.Also, the windows are not well-insulated and a lot of street noise invades. You'll hear truck traffic and sirens during the night, so that might be a concern for light sleepers. I could never seem to get the climate control adjusted and the room was chilly.The staff is friendly and does its best to accomodate guests."
180,1752,Dec 14 2005	Very good hotel	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Beekman for 3 nights in November. The staff were very helpful and got us a room with a good view.The view from the top of the tower is also very good.The room was good with everything you'd expect and very clean and tidy.We got a great deal and would definitely return.
181,1752,"Dec 14 2005	Friendly Hotel.	My wife , 9yr old daughter and I , really enjoyed ourstay at this hotel.The accomodation was comfortableand tidy. Members of staff were extra helpful. Not too much trouble to make a call , with any enquiries youmight have , prior to visiting somewhere.We intend to visit this great city again. We will tryto make a reservation at Beekman Tower as first choice."
182,1752,"Dec 9 2005	Truly Wonderful	It was our first trip to the &quot;Big Apple&quot;. I researched quite a bit and came up with the Beekman Tower through justnewyorkhotels[-]. It averaged $270.00 per night (with taxes &amp; fees) for a 1 bdrm suite. The apartment was much larger than what I expected. Kitchen, livingroom, dining room, bedroom with nice bath. We were in the east wing, which has 2 apts. to each floor. Our own private entrance. It was like being a resident in this wonderful neighborhood for a week.The staff at the Beekman are absolutely &quot;The Best&quot;. I was in the hotel hospitality industry for many years and would hire any one of the employees in this organization. The location is also &quot;The Best&quot;. You have to walk a few blocks up to Park or 5th Ave, but taxi's are readily available outside of the hotel. This is a very established and exclusive area. There are a lot of diplomatic residences due to the United Nations a block away. At 1 Beekman Pl., is where Patrick Dennis's real &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; lived as well as many famous people. Walter Cronkite lives across the street at the United Nations Plaza. We would go for walks at night and never feel uncomfortable.The Nation's Cafe across the street is great, there are numerous restaurants on 2nd Ave.Please enjoy the Beekman, the neighborhood and NYC."
183,1752,"Nov 30 2005	An enjoyable stay	My wife and I stayed at the Beekman Tower for five nights and could not fault this hotel. Staff are helpful and friendly rooms are well furnished and clean. The Top of the Tower restaurant has an excellent view the menu is limited to four or five dishes and is quite expensive at $200 for a steak for me and a chicken dish for my wife. We also had starters, a sweet and a bottle of wine. It had been a long day shopping and we did'nt want to do any more walking. There is an excellent cafe opposite called the Nations and we had breakfast there every morning. Also across the street is a deli and a wine store. We found the Beekman an excellent base for shopping and site seeing and would use it again."
184,1752,"Nov 28 2005	Nice Place for the Price	This hotel is probably a three star hotel, but I gave it four stars based on the price I paid ($159 per night - Orbitz), and the friendly staff. We had a huge studio room in the eastern annex, because we wanted a foldout couch for the kids. We had no view, but we had a kitchen and lots of room. The staff was very nice. The room was clean. The bathroom was small. The location is a bit far from the action, but the neighborhood is quiet and safe. The subway is a six block walk."
185,1752,"Nov 26 2005	Well looked after	Spent 10 nights at the Beekman in Aug/September 05. Fantastic trip to new york, made even better by having this hotel as base. With this length of time we wanted space and the one bedroom suite here with separate bedroom and a kitchen was perfect. Also reasonable as got good deal going through Justnewyorkhotels.10 minute pleasant walk to grand central station. Always able to get cab though if wanted. The main thing to say I think was in respect of the service we got from the staff here who really looked after us from arrival through the ten days.The rooftop restaurant really is a must, (bit pricey for the food really) but frankly the setting is what you're paying for and it is fantastic.We were there during US Open tennis and some fairly big names were staying here, so clearly gets their approval as well. Hope to return."
186,1752,"Nov 21 2005	home from home!	This was our 2nd stay at the Beekman in 1 year. The first trip was OK but the &quot;suite&quot; we had was tiny for us and our 2 kids. This time it was just the 2 of us, but we were given a huuuuuuge suite. The hotel and rooms are in need of serious updating, but they are adequate &amp; comfortable with all the amenities you need. The concierge even recognized us from the last time. There were many familiar faces which was very comforting! The suite was clean, not spotless - but satisfactory. The Beekman is in a lovely, safe neighborhood - we love it and feel very at home there."
187,1752,"Nov 21 2005	Nice hotel nice staff will return	My wife and I recently stayed here on my 50th birthday. We live about 60 miles North of NYC, and I have been going to NYC for dining, concerts, sports, etc. regularly since I was a teenager. This was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. The front desk staff could not have been nicer, and the view from our 18th floor room was beautiful, only to be outdone by the wiew from the top floor lounge. Room was clean and comfortable, and the kitchen was spotless. The furniture was not your standard cookie-cutter hotel furniture, it was really nice.  If you feel you must have that &quot;Big Chain Hotel&quot; feel,with waterfalls and fountains in the lobby, this hotel is not for you. But if you appreciate the attentive staff of a smaller hotel, you will enjoy your stay. Very nice art deco styling, and reasonably priced too!"
188,1752,"Nov 5 2005	Great stay	This hotel was the perfect haven during our hectic week-long tourist break in New York. The rooms were quiet, spacious and clean. We had a studio suite with a double bed and our teenage children had a twin room. There was some confusion over the rooms when we arrived but this was quickly sorted by the excellent front desk staff.The location is ideal: it's in a pleasant, mainly residential neighbourhood but close enough to all the main attractions (although the nearest subway is not close if that's important to you). If you want a big, bold, brash hotel in the middle of New York then don't stay here. If you want somewhere comfortable and relaxing with bigger than average rooms then you can't go wrong here!"
189,1752,"Oct 13 2005	Great hotel good location	My family and I stayed at this hotel while celebrating our 10 year anniversary, I had emailed the staff and they gave us a complimentary box of choccis and bubbly. The staff were very friendly and when our case got lost in transit they were very helpful. the view from the top resturaunt was out of this world but not very child friendly menu so we had a couple of drinks as recommended by others and ate elsewhere. the location was next to one of the trolley tour stops so it was helpful for us to get around although a brisk walk took us to Central Terminal and Empire State. Fantastis city for couple singles and families we will return"
190,1752,"Sep 27 2005	Couldn't have asked for more....	Rooms were spotlessly clean. Staff were extrememly helpful in every way - they organised a taxi to the airport for us, stowed our luggage unitl we neded it, made us a glorious picnic basket, advised us where to eat - wonderful food in Angelo's !!Air conditioning was more than efficient if a little noisy. Location marvellous - near enough to most main attractions to walk but buses available nearby and the subway only a few blocks away. We paid 300 for 5 nights which is brilliant value and we had a junior suite for that price. Kitchen was very useful !!Top of the Tower has a fantastic view and the cocktails are very, very strong!! Food looked great although we didn't eat there. Would recommend to anyone who is on a budget but has high standards (if the two are compatible!!) Those snobs who would only stay at the Waldorf or the Intercontinental Barclay are unlikey to receive better service than we did here. Loved it!!"
191,1752,Sep 14 2005	What a location !	We stayed at the Beekman for 4 days at the end of July during New York's heat wave! Our room didn't get freezing cold but it did stay comfortable. I mean seriously when it is 105 outside how do you expect your room to stay at 70! The staff has to be THE friendliest I have ever dealt with! We had just gotten off of a cruise and decided to extend our vacation and I feel like I got better service from the Beekman than I did the cruise line. It was pretty much a 5 dollar cab ride to anywhere we wanted to go in New York and a reasonable walk to all the major attractions and shopping. I loved the Beekman and will definately stay again when I return in December! The room was large and although promised a King sized bed we received a queen. The room was very large and the kitchen was a great feature that I did use to store ice cream and take home food from the restaraunts. The Top of the World or tower? was delicious and had amazing views! The price was the best part of it all on top of the cleanliness of the room! Overall the best in New York for those on a budget!
192,1752,"Sep 7 2005	Grat experience!	My husband and I stayed at the Beekman over Labor Day weekend. We had a great experience...the staff was very pleasant and efficient and our suite was very nice. We were upgraded for free to a large suite on the 23rd floor (we had originally booked the smallest and least expensive room available). The hotel is in a nice, relatively quiet part of Manhattan. It's a bit of a walk to the theater district/42nd street area but to me that's an advantage...in my opinion it's better to stay in a quieter, less tourist frequented area. I would definitely recommend the Beekman and would stay there again."
193,1752,"Sep 2 2005	comfortable stay	My husband daughter [18] and myself spent 6 nights at the Beekman. We had a great time in New York. The Beekman Tower was ideal for us as our daughter had her own room. The staff are friendly and helpful [when we had a problem with the air conditioning help was prompt and efficient].We all loved the Radio City Music Hall Tour, and arranged prior to our visit a meeting with a Big Apple greeter which was informative, interesting and a good way to familiarise ourselves with the subway."
194,1752,"Aug 28 2005	great return stay	Returned to the beekman for the second time this year, same super service, got upgrade to super suite on 21 floor, staff super as ever nothing to much trouble, shop around there are some great rates around for this hotel so have look around."
195,1752,"Aug 14 2005	Good choice	We recently stayed a week at the Beekman Towers. We had a great time and would recommend this hotel. We arrived early, stored our luggage and went to a local street fair for a few hours. Upon our return we checked into a one bedroom suite on an upper floor. The rooms were large, more like an apartment than a NYC hotel. We had a separate bedroom with a tv in a large armoire, a full bath off the bedroom with bathtub and excellent water pressure, a living room with another tv and comfortable pull out sofa bed, and a full kitchen with full size refrigerator, range, microwave, toaster and all kitchen utensils. Our rooms were very clean, although a little beaten up (there was some peeling wallpaper on one of the walls and the edges of the sofa were a little ratty). Two minor concerns, neither of which affected our enjoyment of the room or the hotel,. A person sleeping in the living room on the sofa bed would need to go into the bedroom to use the bathroom. Also, there were no dressers or clothing storage areas in the living room except for a closet to hang clothes and that foldable rack to hold an open suitcase. Every day our rooms were spotlessly cleaned by the housecleaning staff. Although temps in the city were in the 90's, our rooms were always cool and comfortable. We never heard a sound from the street or any other rooms or in the hallway. All the staff we spoke with, as noted by others, were friendly and accommodating. We went online to the Affinia website, and found a promotional rate of $209 which included a daily continental breakfast in the Zephyr Grill and a welcoming cocktail at the Top of the Towers restaurant. The breakfast was appreciated. There was a decent selection of fresh fruit, juices, bagels, croissants, muffins, scones, yogurts, cereals, etc. The coffee was very strong. We generally had breakfast as a couple and brought a tray of food up to our sleeping teenager. We usually ate at the different areas we visited in the city, but locally can recommend the Nations Cafe across the street (which provides room service to the hotel) and Blockhead Burritos on Second Ave. Some have noted the location is not too convenient. We almost always took a city bus (with our unlimited MetroCards) downtown/crosstown. The buses we used were either right around the corner, or a block away on Second Avenue. We never waited more than five minutes for a bus, except for one evening coming home from Times Square. (Note, we did not travel by bus after about 10 p.m.) Although subways are quicker, we enjoyed &quot;sightseeing&quot; while on the city buses. Our bus drivers were generally courteous, helpful and almost always announced each stop. One morning a two year old with her nanny got on the bus. She sang the &quot;ABC&quot; song and the full bus burst in to spontanous applause after she finished. I don't know who was more surprised, us or the little girl. We found the NYC residents to be quite helpful to us tourists. One woman even went out of her way and ran after us to correct her earlier directions.  One suggestion - since checkout is at noon, we saved our tour of the United Nations until the last day. The tour is only about an hour, and the UN is only a block away. We woke up, ate, packed and then went on a 10 o'clock tour. We were able to get back to the hotel, freshen up, have a cool drink and check out before noon. We would definitely return to the Beekman Towers in the future."
196,1752,Aug 5 2005	Terrible	Air conditioner in room did not function properly. Staff was unresponsive to requests to fix the problem. Carpets in rooms were shabby and rooms were not cleaned properly
197,1752,"Aug 1 2005	First Class Hotel	Loved the Beekman.We stayed at the Beekman Tower Hotel at the end of June/beginning of July 2005 for 10 nights. Having read reviews from other Trip Advisor members, we had high expectations and were not disappointed.We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 4th floor overlooking first avenue, which was surprisingly quiet. We had a kitchen with cooker, microwave and fridgefreezer, a separate sitting area with sofa bed and a separate bedroom with double bed.The room was very clean and fresh towels and toiletries were provided on a daily basis. The door staff and ladies at reception were very courteous and friendly and after a long day sight seeing and shopping, it was nice to return to the comfort of the Beekman.Having stayed in New York previously, I cannot recommend the Beekman highly enough. This is an excellent hotel and I would definitely stay here again."
198,1752,"Jul 17 2005	We loved it!	My family and I stayed at the Beekman in June 2005 duting the heatwave. The hotel was cool throughout it all. The suite was very clean if not a little dated. The bed was extremely comfortable and they offer several pillow varieties from which to choose.Our suite was on the 22nd floor and we had a small patio area and could see the East River and the Empire State Bldg.. Staff was very accomodating and we liked the location. It was very safe and not too far from bus or cabs. (Although on a regular workday don't expect to get a cab between 4-8pm and if you do get a cab, don't expect to move very quickly). It just wasn't that far to Grand Central Terminal -- afterall, you are in New York City and you will be walking. There is a groc /deli across the street and the Nations Cafe across the street that we highly reccommend for breakfast. It is a better value than the continental breakfast at the hotel.We ate at the Top of the Tower and it was great food, but not family friendly. Our kids did not want the full selection included for the meal and they adjusted our bill accordingly.I would definately stay here again."
199,1752,"Jul 13 2005 	Old	Stayed here around graduation week as there was no other option. Room was old, smelly and with a dated kitchenette. Was a suite, but still small. Staff was very friendly and attentive, though. Restaurant looked interesting, but didn't try. Near UN and nothing else. Boring location."
200,1752,"Jul 12 2005	Beekman Towers: Very Nice Stay	My wife and I had a lovely Saturday - Sunday stay at the Beekman Towers, on the East Side, blocks from the UN. The nice folks at the front desk upgraded us to a suite, with a balcony looking down 1st Avenue. The suite was wonderful. the kitchenette clean and tidy and room service was on time and prepared correctly, but a tad steep.Good neighborhood, a huge grocery / salad bar across the street and other conveniences within a block or two. Plenty of cabs, as it is away from subway lines.Besides the hotel we enjoyed great jazz at Smoke on the Upper West Side, art at the Frick Museum on 5th Avenue and a nice Sunday service at St Bart's on Park and 50th.A great 24 hour refresher on things that make NYC wonderful."
201,1752,"Jul 3 2005	Trust Your Fellow Reviewers	Great place to stay in NYC. The only neg is that it is a little far from the subway( nearest station is Lex/51st), but with that comment out of the way, the rest of the story is quite positive. We had a small suite with a living room, kitchen and separate bedroom- and what a view! Staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Across the street, there is a great market that is open 24/7. Nice folks, but be quiet late at night- there's a baby sleeping upstairs! Lots of restaurants nearby- we ate at Lasagna Grill- chosen because it was overflowing with locals. Excellent food at reasonable prices and yes, they serve quite a bit more than the restaurant's namesake. We liked being in a neighborhood; felt we really had a feel for living in this great city!"
202,1752,"Jun 12 2005	Excellent choice.	This was our first trip to New York and we were a little apprehensive. However, this hotel really was excellent. The room was spotlessly clean and the hotel staff were very professional - nothing was too much trouble. They responded very quickly to any requests we had and were extremely helpful if we had any queries. The area surrounding the hotel was very pleasant and we were happy to be outside the centre of Manhattan. New York is such a hectic place that it was nice to return to the quieter area around the hotel in the nights after a busy day walking and sightseeing.I read all the reviews on this hotel before my trip and wondered if they were accurate, however, I can honestly say that this hotel lived up to all the positive comments I'd read. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and if I ever visit New York again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel."
203,1752,"May 9 2005	Clean rooms excellent professional service	Stayed at the Beekman for 6 days April/May 2005. Good welcoming by helpful staff, initially disappointed with low floor accommodation as had asked for high room but more than compensated by good facilities and an excellent sized room- more an apartment! Amazingly helpful staff when any small problem arose, nothing was too much trouble.Views were magnificent from the top of the tower bar, probably the best in Manhattan at night, although the cocktails and food were rather expensive.Situated in a safe area with all conveniences situated nearby. The subway really isn't that far (10mins walk) Also served by regular bus just outside hotel.I would certainly consider using this hotel again and commend the hotel management on a well run professional and courteous service."
204,1752,"May 5 2005 	Pretty Art Deco but a little out of the way	Nice hotel, small foyer but the rooms are more than comfortable. I had just a single room and a kitchen; I understand other rooms are larger having a sep living room. The cafe on 26 only served a fixed price menu the night I stayed which was quite pricey at $45 or $65 plus tax but very nice for a cocktail. As others have said, a bit of a walk to the nearest subway on Lexington and 51st but easy access to a good cross town bus on 50th and 2nd (or 49th and 2nd if you are heading towards Times Square)."
205,1752,"Apr 10 2005	Excellent if rooms are high	I experienced two rooms during my stay at beekman, because at first they put me in a 3rd floor room which was quite good, but views was not really exciting and a bit of noise pervade our room, so i asked to changed it. The receptionist, who called 1 second after we got into our room, asked if everithing was ok, so i asked for change. She replies some better room may be free the next day. So we waited and we received (with no extra ) an incredible 21st floor room with an excellent view, a king size bed, and lots of space around it! Excellent!"
206,1752,"Apr 9 2005	Excellent Hotel - Met our expectations	Stayed at the Beekman for 6 nights commencing on 28 March with our teenage daughters (17 &amp; 15) - a fairly late change of booking when we decided we'd like more space &amp; the reviews posted were all very encouraging.In many ways there is not much to add to what others have said, except to say that most of the comments are very representative. The staff are fantastic - nothing is too much trouble, the nearby Nations Cafe is good, and supermarkets across the road and 1 block west on 2nd Avenue are very convenient. The rooms are very comfortable and extremely spacious. We got an excellent rate via a UK travel agent but the hotel's own rates are pretty good.Don't be put off by comments about distance from the metro - it's only 10 minutes walk but the regular buses stop just across the road on the corner of 1st Avenue and 49th Street (you can use your metro card so no extra cost) and these will take you to and from 5th Avenue / Times Square in more than 10 minutes.Plenty of restaurants nearby and we always felt safe when we were out walking in the surrounding streets, even late at night.A great place to stay that provides lots of space and excellent value."
207,1752,"Apr 8 2005	Great deal on a suite	Got a great deal at Orbitz. At check-in, asked for and received free double upgrade. Great view from 25th floor, but is too close to kitchen noise, and would avoid this floor. Suite was huge, plenty of room for family of 4. Hotel clean and pretty with excellent service. Absolutely would stay again."
208,1752,"Apr 3 2005	Absolutely Satisfactory	The Beekman is a very comfortable good quality hotel. While not luxury by any standards (including the price), the hotel is clean and comfortable. The service cannot be faulted, and the kitchen is very convenient, particularly during freak snowstorms that make venturing outside very uncomfortable. The kitchen is a little dated (but fully functional), but the bathrooms are lovely and the water pressure in the shower is excellent. The hotel cannot be faulted, but is missing the oomph that would make it exceptional. All in all if you are looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable hotel with a fabulous view from the rooftop grill and a location in the heart of the East Side, the Beekman is for you."
209,1752,"Mar 21 2005 	Strongly recommend	Have stayed here twice in the last two months for long weekends and strongly recommend this hotel for business/ tourist travelors looking for low-frills professional service with excellent value. If you a comfortable, spacious environment without the in-your-face glamour of some bigger name hotels this is a very good choice. Each room has a full kitchen which is very nice and the rooms are certainly large by NYC standards. On my most recent trip, I was travelling with my fiancee's parents and we each booked our own rooms but upon arrival the desk upgraded us to a very comfortable two-bedroom suite. They are much less travel savvy than my fiancee or I and felt very comfortable at this hotel."
210,1752,"Mar 14 2005	Great art-deco hotel	We stayed at the Beekman Tower in March 2005 and were impressed with the professionalism and friendliness of the staff; the size and cleanliness of the rooms; and the lovely view of the city from the 26th floor restaurant/bar. Architecturally speaking, this hotel is an art-deco gem. I'd highly recommend it, though other reviews did comment that it's not close to subway stops. (We took cabs and walked.)"
211,1752,"Mar 8 2005	Suite Success	Booked a studio at a bargain price, yet were upgraded to an Art Deco suite! Lovely quiet (for NY) location close to the UN, a bit of a walk from the other Midtown highlights but crosstown buses run from nearby. Friendly and helpful staff added to the pleasure of our stay. Excellent diner just across 1st Ave for breakfast. Will stay there again next time we're in NY."
212,1752,"Mar 4 2005	Absolutely fabulous!	Just returned from 6 nights at the Beekman Tower. The suites are really great, just like having your own apartment. The location is really handy there's a general grocery shop and diner across the road. It's a few blocks to get to everything but the walking is easy and there's loads to see on the way. Taxis stop right outside without any effort. I loved this place, the staff were really nice, the room was spotless with excellent service and I would stay there agian tomorrow. Top tip! Use the hotels driver service to go back to the airport at the end of your stay. We travelled to JFK through really heavy traffic, a suited Lincoln collected us, 1 hours drive (with traffic) $ 55. inclusive. A great deal."
213,1752,"Feb 12 2005	great rooms with excellent views and staff	arrived 5th feb for a 4 nights break,room was excellent sorry no this was not a room it was an apartment with lounge and kitchenette with microwave ,oven ,fridge freezer etc ,etc and separate bedroom with excellent views from 19 th floor .clean bathroom and linen. staff were very friendly and accommodating stored our luggage and arranged taxi ride back to airport with very friendly driver. well placed for all major sights , good range of restaurants in area , and was surprisingly quiet after dark try restaurant at top of tower good views of manhattan.  this was booked on internet and would use again."
214,1752,"Feb 4 2005	Excellent value spacious and tidy rooms.	7 of us shared 4 one bedroom suites and all were delighted with the space and how clean they all were. Superb value, I have spent a lot more to stay in inferior accomodation. As someone who slept in the sofa bed I can confirm that it was as comfortable as a normal bed NOT one of those with a flimsy mattress!Having read the few negative reviews on here I can only assume they are talking about somewhere else- peeling paint and small rooms??Simply not the case.The only negative were the pricey drinks in the 'Top of the Tower' but you don't have to go there, it was just a handy place to meet up before a night out."
215,1752,"Jan 25 2005	very well located and friendly	Stayed there for 5 days from 31st December 2004.On 1st and 49th Streets and easy walking to the main shops and a short taxi ride to almost anywhere in Manhattan.The staff were very friendly; not what we expected in New York and our suite had a small kitchen with an endless supply of coffee bags for the machine supplied.Staff happy to help with directions to a bagle shop, how to order a NY pizza, laundry etc.I rate the staff as very highly trained and well above average.My son and his wife had a sofa bed in the main lounge room which wasn't very comfortable; they were better when they put the mattress on the floor.Noise was an issue even on the 18th floor..but I think this is normal for a place that never sleeps.A great New Year's Eve party on the 26th floor and open to guests in the reataurant..we did not dine but went along just prior to midnight and could dance and have a great time.An old building, comfortable and reasonably priced as we booked through the interrnet and got a price about half the rack rate."
216,1752,"Jan 21 2005	Got it right the first time!!!!!!!	Stayed 4 days &amp; 3 nights in May of 2004. Great hotel, great staff, great rooms, they really did &quot;get it right the first time&quot;. Found a great deal thru (---). If you get a chance you should use these guys, their great, in a city that does great as an afterthought, these guys stand-out.L.K.TN"
217,1752,"Jan 18 2005	Beyond great!	Stayed here for one quick overnight for shopping, eating and theatering. It is a beautiful Art Deco hotel in a perfect location. Suite was more than roomy, quiet and clean. The Top of the Tower is a perfect place for a late drink, with views to die for. The front desk and valets were very welcoming and helpful. They are a group of young people who really seem to enjoy their jobs, which comes from the top. They could not have been more helpful, offering to call a car, get a cab, etc. This type of service is not typical of a huge impersonal city such as NYC. They make you feel comfortable, safe and happy. They do it right! Kudos to the management of this hotel group!"
218,1752,"Jan 17 2005	What a great stay	Had a great 7 nights at the Beekman, the beds are a bit small, but fantastic having so much space. Rooms were cleaned everyday, showers are brilliant after a long day's walking.Couldn't fault anything about the hotel, a bit dated but most hotels in the city seem to be. Even got a bottle of champagne that we cheekily asked for!"
219,1752,"Jan 13 2005	Wonderful stay at a beautiful hotel	My wife and I arrived at the Beekman last Fridayand stayed for 5 nights.We were generously upgraded as it was my wife's 50th birthday. Although our original suite was far larger than most hotel accommodation and was spotlessly clean,our upgrade gave us superb views and even more space.The suites are in really good order and kept very clean and tidy by the housekeepers and the toiletries supplied are of good quality.The staff,especially Mr Laydon ,looked after us very well and were all friendly and helpful.The view from &quot;The Top of The Tower&quot; is breathtaking .Location-wise,the hotel is in a safe neighbourhood with lots of delis,restaurants and shops close by.We would unreservedly recommend this hotel and we would definitely go back ourselves"
220,1752,"Jan 9 2005	Great service but ...	We stayed over New Year, 28th Dec 04 - 2nd Jan 05The staff are very friendly and accommodating. However, our one bed suite was clearly in need of refurbishment. Public areas looked a little better. The suite accommodation did afford us a good degree of privacy as we travelled with our teenage son.The location, on 1st and 49th, means a short 15 minute walk to the Rockerfeller Center and shopping. We often hailed a cab, cheap at around 4 dollars. The Nations cafe, over the road, offers decent food- especially good for breakfast. There is a 24 hour mini market over the road too."
221,1752,Dec 8 2004	Affinia have it right	We stayed at The Beekman for 5 nights 16/11/04 -21/11/04. Very friendly staff. superb room and facilities. Great location.Well done Beekman.
222,1752,"Dec 7 2004	Nice hotel friendly staff huge rooms	Very nice hotel and spacious rooms. Nice to have a seperate living/kitchen area and 2 TV's!! The staff were very friendly and helpful, breakfasts were huge and the top of the tower is something else. The only downside to our stay was that we requested a non smoking room and we ended up with a smokers room but we were checked in round thanks giving and the hotel was fully booked. I wouldn't have any problems in coming back to this hotel again"
223,1752,"Nov 27 2004	Great rooms and friendly service	A friend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in October 2004. We were a little apprehensive because of the promotional rate (half off). However, we were very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the hotel and our suite. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was great having a separate living room and a kitchen, which we stocked with snacks, sodas and water from the market right across the street. The microwave came in handy for popcorn for late night TV. The bathroom was very clean and stocked with nice toilettries. Our room had a great view of the city (18E). The restaurant on the 26th floor is amazing--it has an enclosed terrace with gorgeous city and river views. An excellent place for cocktails before hitting the town.The ONLY downside is the hotel is a good 10-15 minute's walk to the nearest subway entrance on Lex (about 5 blocks). However, I would definately stay at this hotel again."
224,1752,"Oct 15 2004	liked it	beekman hotel is safe bet for any person visiting new york. the hotel is located on the corner of 1st and 49th. the real only downfall would be that the nearest train station is on lexington and 51st which is about 4 blocks away. there is a bus across the street on 49th number m27 or m50 that will take you crosstown which is really convenient. other than that, the hotel was nice. rooms are clean. service was great."
225,1752,"Sep 30 2004	I can't rate this hotel highly enough!	I almost booked a hotel based on website details when I found tripadvisor and discovered that the hotel I was about to book had terrible reviews. I booked at the Beekman based on the reviews on this site, and was not disappointed.The suites are huge for New York standards, with more than enough space to try on all of the clothes that I bought! We even had a dining table to eat our takeout chinese on, and a kitchenette if you want to cook!The staff were very friendly and helpful, and although the hotel is not located right in the centre, I found it to be perfect for accessing all the places I wanted to see, with lots of bars and restaurants nearby.The walk from Grand Central Station took only about 10 minutes.I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and definitely intend to stay here again in future.A great place to stay!"
226,1752,"Sep 20 2004	Great Hotel with fantastic service	Three mates and I stayed here over the weekend of 9/11 and found the hotel to be a very pleasant experience. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. The room was clean, tidy and spacious enough for all four of us to have separate beds with room to spare. One minor criticism is the lifts which do take a while to come when called, however it is my understanding that the hotel are installing new ones soon. The location is excellent with only a five-minute walk to midtown and the subway connections. There is a great supermarket opposite, which stocks most things you would ever need. I have stayed at many hotels now in New York and this hotel was the nicest I have stayed in yet. I would definitely use this hotel again and recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone thinking about taking a trip to New York!"
227,1752,"Jul 6 2004	try the Beekman first	Any time I come to NYC the beekman is the first choice. The staff is very accomodating, the rooms are spacious. The location is perfect. There is no better place to unwind, it is like living in your own Ny apt. Cable, small kithen, clean, priced competitively, .the more great reviews , the harder it is to get a reservation or upgrade. The staff really aims to please and takes care of the guests.bravo! I always try the Beekman first !"
228,1752,"Jun 27 2004	We 'Love' This Place!!!	My husband and I took our first NYC trip together in May 2004 to celebrate our anniversary, so expectations were high. It seemed we were playing &quot;musical rooms&quot; the first few days which put a damper on our plans, but were quickly accomodated by a very helpful staff. Our one bedroom suite was marvelous! Spacious, all amenities you could ask for, and a great view. The location was ideal, offering scenic walks and a quiet alternative to the more congested parts of Manhattan. One block west is Associated Supermarket which we found fulfilled our shopping needs. Can't forget the Zephyr Grill. Breakfast was fresh and delicious. Staying at the Beekman only sweetened our memorial occasion. We hope to return to New York soon and stay here once again."
229,1752,"Jun 24 2004	a great value	We stayed at the Beekman beginning of june, 2004 for 3 nights and really enjoyed it. The front desk staff were very helpful, friendly and efficient and we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite! Although they are in need of a little updating the suites are absolutely huge and you can pretend that you are living in Manhattan in your own flat. There is a good convenience store right across the street for stocking up your kitchen and plenty of restaurants nearby. (By the way, your next door neighbor is the UN! If you like Indian food try &quot;INDIGO&quot; (around the corner on 50th I believe)--it was truly the best I have ever had. it was Tony Awards weekend, so we got take out from a local deli buffet and cozied up in our living room !You will like this hotel--it is not luxury, but it is clean and very spacious. We love the walk (isn't that what NY is all about?) so we did not mind the location. Even if you dont eat at the restaurant, you must go see the view!Overall, a great value."
230,1752,"Jun 4 2004	A safe bet	The Beekman Tower is a safe bet for anyone despairing after reading hundreds of bad hotel reviews. The suite we had was clean, spacious and well-furnished and the main bed and sofa bed were comfortable. The kitchen was nice to have although we didn't use it much. The staff were mostly friendly and competent. Traffic noise on the 7th floor was minimal. After checking out, luggage could be stored and the hotel organised a car to the airport.The hotel is in a fairly quiet, safe area near the UN. There is no subway station nearby (10-15mins walk), but the buses 27 and 50 go across the town along 49th St, returning along 50th St. Weekly Metro Cards are a very good buy if you're staying four days or more. Taxis are quite inexpensive for short journeys that are awkward by subway and bus.We used the UN Plaza cafe/restaurant on the opposite corner for breakfast every morning, which we'd recommend."
231,1752,"Apr 4 2004	The Only Place I will Stay When In NYC	We travel to NYC about 4/year and after having stayed at numerous other hotels over the years - we decided to try the Beekman after hearing from a friend about the excellent food and accomodations. We're glad we did!. The suites were beautifully decorated, the staff courteous and welcoming and the food was scrumptious. We have dined at both the main level restaurant and at the skyline level - the view was breathtaking! The waitstaff was courteous and we even noted that the head chef came out and checked on the guests and their meals/evenings - what a pleasant and nice touch! Keep up the good work Beekman - We'll be back!"
232,1752,"Apr 4 2004	Bad start - great finish	My stay started very badly arriving at 21.00hrs and being told that the hotel had overbooked despite the fact that I had booked well in advance and my arrival time was known. The staff were very apologetic and they called a cab and took me to their sister hotel a block away but this was a huge disappointment. I said I would return the next day and expect a room and that an upgrade would be a goodwill gesture. I duly arrived and was given a marvellous suite with a balcony on one side that gave a great view of the 59th street bridge and on the other side the most amazing view of the Manhattan skyline, particularly at night. I was also given a complimentary dinner that night in the Zephyr Grill and the steak was absolutely fantastic. The location for me was fine as I love to walk and when I needed the subway then Lexington was only a few minutes away. So nice hotel, friendly staff, shame about the over booking but can highly recommend so long as you don't need to be in the centre of things."
233,1752,"Mar 23 2004	Excellent Excellent (didn't I say it was Excellent....)	We stayed 9 nights during March &amp; we found the Beekman to be an excellent hotel in every department. We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite for $158 a night, booked through the Affinia website, which for what we got was excellent valueI spent hours researching where to stay in NY, as we were wary about finding a stinker; we found the absoulute opposite!I could talk for ages about the qualities of the room / hotel, but a list will hopefully paint the picture. Superb sized room with separate lounge area, sofa, table, chairs, great size. Excellent separate kitchen with dishwasher, fridge-freezer, microwave, hob, toaster, cutlery, kettle etc. All rooms clean, with excellent maid service and all the good touches like iron, hairdryer, safe etc. Basically its a good quality flat, with excellent space. Good bedroom and excellent shower / bath.Helpful staff - we asked to be moved to the back of the hotel as there was a little road noise &amp; this was done efficiently; courtesy calls by the manager to make sure all is well, etc. For NY, the road noise is minimal but we are not used to that, so the back of the property was better. Express any preferences you have when you book.The downside; well the only one we could think of could be its location; 49th Street, 1st Avenue. This was not a problem for us; it is only 6/7 mins walk from the tube at Lexington Avenue and there is a bus stop close to the hotel. Its not too far from everything. However, if you must be close to say Times Square or Central Park, then this may not be the place for you.All in all, a cracking hotel. Well worth a stay."
234,1752,"Jan 20 2004	An Upstate review of the Beekman Towers	My favorite place to stay when in NYC. Pleasant, attentive hotel staff.Outstanding gourmet food served by waiters who knew the menu. I even met the head chef who took time to greet my guests and I . He wanted to be sure we enjoyed our food. We certainly did!! I'll be back!"
235,1752,"Jan 17 2004	Like Having You're own New York Apartment	Stayed at the Beekman summer 2003. Stayed on the 12th floor with great views of the UN Plaza and First Ave. Large, clean 1 bedroom suite. Bathroom had a view! Kitchen light never worked, despite frequent requests to the management for replacement. Top of the Tower is a real classy place. Great views of Midtown. Staying at the Beekman again summer 2004."
236,1752,"Jan 14 2004	The Beekman was worth it!	I spent about 3 days in NYC back in May '02. The Beekman Tower was recommended from clients of mine. I hadn't been to the city since a high school trip decades ago but wanted to vacation there to visit the sites. So, solo I flew up knowing only what I had read about in travel guides, I was anxious. As soon as I pulled up to the hotel I knew I was going to enjoy this trip. Very stylish and front reception polite, friendly. Cozy. I was given a one bedroom suite on the 17th floor overlooking First Ave. Great large (apartment) unit with lots of windows, livingroom, dining, desk, fax, kitchen, nicely appointed bedroom, smallish bath but with the best view from a toilet in the city!! B-fast in the Zephyr was superb and cocktails up in the Tower were excellent! Did not order room service. Felt pampered every day coming back to my &quot;place&quot; after long days out in the greatest city!! Location is good--a little &quot;too east&quot; but it all depends on what you want to do and see there. I will miss staying there this May as I am returning to NYC with friends but they want The Waldorf. Hope it lives up to &quot;my place&quot; at The Beekman."
237,1752,"Jan 10 2004	A Great Experience	The Beekman Towers is the perfect place for families. The suites are spacious and clean, the staff was friendly, enthusiastic, and very responsive to all our needs. It was a great value for the dollar. A perfect place to unwind at the end of the day!"

1,1756,"Okay to stay at this hotel.	Liked this hotel eventhough it is in a funny area. 24 hr auto shop across the street, stables for the Central Park Horse just up the street and high rise building construction on one side. It looks like it's in the middle of nowhere but it is in fact close to everything. Felt safe enough to go out for a smoke at night. Not the biggest rooms but clean and the staff was friendly and recommanded an excellent restaurant for dinner."
2,1756,"Nov 10 2009 	space-heater-heated cold smokey room with a alarm repeatedly sounding	The Best Western Convention Center Hotel has confirmed that they rented out not only my room but other rooms as well without working heating systems with overnight low temperatures of 42 degrees in New York City. The management said, &quot;We told them that it was simply unacceptable for our guests to stay in our hotel without heat.&quot; Unbelievably, the management then rented out these rooms with small space-heaters without any respect for their customers or their brand.I paid for a king-sized-bed room. Without any warning, I slept a twin-sized bed in the cold with a smokey space-heater that caused the smoke alarm to repeatedly wake me. My important trip was adversely impacted. The management says twin beds with space heaters with 42 degree outside temperatures are in keeping with Best Western's brand. Only a smokey room is slightly inconvenient. They offered a 10% discount.I have stayed in no-name extremely inexpensive hotels in the wintertime in mainland China who have a standard of quality that vastly exceeds Best Western's. In Manhattan there is no reason to ever willingly accept this situation.If you are forced to stay here check for two twin beds (each with their own set of sheets) deceptively hidden under a single king-sized bedspread. When I complained, the management called this their idea of a &quot;California King.&quot; This seems like a simply illegal bait and switch to me. Immediately check to make sure the heating and cooling system works. Immediately verify that your smoke alarm will not repeatedly sound during the night. Wait, I believe this is impossible, I advise staying in any of the plethora of other hotels that have heat and at least a modicum of concern for their guests and their reputation."
3,1756,"Nov 6 2009 	Central Convenient Location - Lovely Hotel	First time in NY and found this hotel. Very reasonably priced for the centre of NY. Everything really convenient - a couple of blocks from Times Square, Subway Station and bus centre. Rooms really clean and quite good size for me and my friend. Very reasonable breakfast included in the price (choices of cereals, toast, pastries etc). Not the most appealing outlook with a garage and building site beside, but no complaints on the noise. Very quiet location. Hotel service very good as staff sorted out everything we requested."
4,1756,"Oct 15 2009 	nice location	nice location at one block of Times Square, the hotel was ok, good just a week end... nice room but no curtains so hard to sleep with the BIG sign of the hotel in front of my window..."
5,1756,"Oct 14 2009 	If you need to be close to the Javits this place is just fine.	Completely adequate hotel. Rooms small but clean, Wifi works okay, TV doesn't have a zillion channels, but it has CNN and Weather. Continental breakfast is fine if you don't need sausage and eggs and pancakes. The location is what it is: if you need to be close to the Javits center, you can't get any closer. The street is totally industrial, but in fact is never empty since there's a 24-hour auto body shop across the street (catering to taxicabs). Didn't feel unsafe. Plenty of cabs on 10th Avenue any time. Also a 24-hour Dunkin Donuts (in a gas station) and a great little bar/restaurant, Hudson Yards, on 10th and 35th. Amazingly quiet hotel--but the street can be a bit noisy, so make sure you get a room in the back. In a couple of years, this area will be filled with high rises and will be very different, but for now, the hotel is definitely recommended if you need to be in that spot."
6,1756,"Oct 9 2009 	Not what I expected	The hotel is in a weird area, 2 or 3 blocks up it is ok to walk at night, in the hotel block is not at all! The room was small, even though the bed was big. The matress was old, so it would hurt my back everynight.. there wasnt lots of space to walk in the room. My room smells like cigarettes even if the hotel is 100% non-smoking. The breakfast is thw weirdest thing! All comes in plastic! And is not very tasty... There aren't many channels to choose from on TV, but there is wireless inet in the rooms. Bathroom was quite ok. Reception also."
7,1756,"Oct 8 2009 	Pros and Cons	I recently spent 3 nights at this hotel while attending a conference at the Javits Convention Center in midtown Manhattan. My experience:It's in a weird-but not scary-neighborhood. There's a big 24 hour taxi repair place right across the street, a building under construction on the right and a horse barn of some kind ('m not kidding!) on the left. But I walked around til 11 pm by myself every night I was there and didn't feel unsafe at all.It can be noisy. The noise isn't from the other rooms or from the hallways, but from the outside. But I'm a mountain girl, so maybe I'm a bit sensitive on this point. Anyway, I always travel with earplugs, so it wasn't a big deal.There's nothing fancy about it, but it's clean and has everything you need, plus a little more, like a pc and printer in the lobby for guest use.The staff was really nice and helpful, which is always a big plus in my book.They feed you a continental breakfast -nothing fancy, but you'll find something to hold you over - cereal, toast, muffins, jiuce, etc.The absolutely best thing was the location. Truly just a half a block from the 11th Avenue entrance of the Convention Center! It's also just 7-8 blocks to Times Square - maybe a 20 minute trek by foot.The in-room wifi was free and better than I've experienced in most hotels. The clientelle is average folks on a budget from all over the world and they all seemed happy to be there. It was half the price of other hotels in the area and I was not disappointed."
8,1756,"Oct 5 2009 	NYC: Expensive	One assumes that if there is a convention nearby, this is a great place to stay. For the casual visitor to New York City...not so much. The location is not great for transportation by train, but there are plenty of taxi's. It is across the street from what must be a 24 hour auto shop, which seems to like drilling in the night. There is also a train track next door and once a day the place shudders with the train going by. We were treated to on our first day no to no elevator and the second day, no hot water between 12-3 pm. Once inside, it not the largest room, but for the money you can surely find smaller. We actually had a great view. It did feel a little lonely out there on 10th Avenue and that may be its biggest drawback."
9,1756,"Sep 26 2009 	Good value for money 15 minuse walk form subway	I booked this hotel using the betting option at priceline.com. We got a room at the high season of September for 120$/night  good value for money for a hotel in Manhattan. Hotel is clean. Rooms are small, but good enough after walking all day. It is including continental breakfast. One disadvantage is the location. It is located at west 38th street. 15 minutes walking form a subway station. But it is safe to walk around at night.There is a train that passes near the hotel. Sometimes too noisy."
10,1756,"Aug 3 2009 	Clean and Comfortable....Great Bargain!	Having never been to NYC before, I wasn't expecting alot from this hotel for the price. I was pleasantly surprised! The location looked a little funky, but once inside, the front desk staff was courteous and friendly and the lobby was clean and cheerful. Once in our room, it was small, but clean with a comfortable bed. We felt very safe there and had a excellent experience! I would stay there again for sure!"
11,1756,"Jul 30 2009 	You Pay for Location	On 38th a block from Javits Ctr., able to park the company van between Javits and Hotel after unloading to exhibit. Was able to access it during my multiday stay w/o extra charge.Great to walk to Javits in the morning without finding a car or show shuttle. My associates were able to go back to the room during the show to take a break and make confidential phone calls. Walked to nearbly restaurants and got gifts in times square. Overall good, new foam style mattress, internet and cell coverage dependable. Had some difficulties with rates as we added and dropped reservations in weeks and days prior to the show. One $ 200 dollar room went up to approx. $ 500, ouch! Continental Breakfast ok."
12,1756,"Jun 22 2009 	Not bad at all	I searched high an low for a good affordable hotel which was not rat infested!!!! The Western is not bad at all. It is basically a travelodge. Clean small sized room. Nice power shower. Had a safe. 10-15 minute walk from times square and Maceys. Breakfast consists of cereal, doughnuts and bagels.The hotel is opposite a 24hr mechanic which can be noisy therefore you ideally want a room at the back of the hotel rather than the front otherwise ear plugs do the job just fine.They are building skyscareprs either side of the hotel but never heard a peep from there so dont worry when u get there that it will noise central!!! It really isnt.The area does not look all that great but in a week never experienced any probs and on occassion was walking back at 2-3am.Overall it is a great hotel for the price"
13,1756,"Jun 21 2009 	Decent hotel at affordable rates	The hotel is good value for money. It is located slightly away from times square and Broadway, the buzzing areas of NYC. Otherwise, the hotel has good amenities, very helpful staff."
14,1756,"May 9 2009 	Good enough!	It's a Best Western and knowing that NYC in this price range offers postage stamp-sized rooms, it worked out fine. I had some hesitation reading reviews here, but the staff was terrific, the rooms were fine, complimentary breakfast a huge convenience, and all in all was satisfied. Especially with the staff. I was one of the few Americans here, with Europeans making up the majority of guests. Breakfast was typical BW continental style. Remember that the rooms are very small (which is typical in NYC) and they could stand updating but free WiFi and breakfast with a relatively central location? You're good to go!"
15,1756,"Apr 17 2009 	Spend the Extra $ to stay somewhere else	My husband an I took Super Shuttle from the airport and were one of the last to get dropped off. We watched everyone go to these nice looking hotels and then drove through a not-very-nice looking part of time and voila, this was the Best Western. The help staff was very nice, however when we got to our floor, the entire floor smelled like smoke. And when we opened the door to the room it was almost as if the bed touched all four walls. I don't think our luggage would have even fit in the room with us. The place would be good for young travelers really trying to save some money, but for a married couple trying to have a nice stay in NYC it is not the place. We didn't stay the night and instead went to the Courtyard Marriott. Twice the price, but still a good deal for Manhattan and MUCH more comfortable."
16,1756,Mar 27 2009 	bit of the beaten track but good value	I ahve to admit the walk from Penn station a bit long about 15 mins and the area didn't look too good but overall the rooms were basic but it served a purpose and if you just want somewhere to get your head down it certainly does the job. Breakfast okay but it is free. Would possibly stay again if in New York.
17,1756,"Feb 17 2009 	Couldn't beat price at that location	I raved about it. For midtown Manhattan the price was great. In fact, it was so good I was wary until I got there and saw my room. Small, sure, but I couldn't see much difference with a Holiday Inn Express room. Breakfast was basic, but filling and included in the price. WiFi in the room worked well, which is important to me when I travel. In fact the only quibble I had was when I asked where I could find a plug adapter for my laptop. I'd forgotten mine. The guy at the desk told me to go all the way to 48th and 8th Ave, but I found one only two blocks away on 8th Ave between 37th &amp; 38th.I recommended it to everyone I met on the trip."
18,1756,"Jan 29 2009 	Great value!	I think that this was a great hotel for the money....via Priceline. The room was small but very clean and always pretty quiet. It is a little out of the way but you walk from Times Square, right near a firestation and then are there so it's not too bad plus there is always the taxi option."
19,1756,"Jan 21 2009 	Economical and Nice Location	I stayed for 4 days there and it was very pleasant. I walked everyday to Times Square and Broadway, which is about 10-15 mins. Room was small and clean, but the bedskirt was ripped. Continental Breakfast was pretty good. This Hotel is really good for the people who are in NYC for sightseeing and spend most of the time outside their room.Hotel has a security service which charges $1 per bag to hold."
20,1756,"Jan 4 2009	Worst Western	So, I obviously I stayed at a two star hotel, and Im not expecting the amenities of the Ritz Carton, but this place was a TOTAL dump. Where do I start? First of all we got a King size bed, which was actually two beds put side by side to make it look like a king. That wasnt that bad. But the room was SO small. The room had an armoire with hangers where you could hang up your clothes because there was no closet. But you couldnt open up the armoire all the way because the room was too small and it hit the bed. The hotels location is pretty crappy because its about a 15 minute walk from the closest subway station. Theres nothing around the hotel, and the neighborhood is a bit shady. (next to a gentlemans club) Our room was fairly clean minus the several pubic hairs I saw on our comforter, and on our counter in the bathroom. Gross!!! The thing that bugged me the most was that the major TV networks did not work on our TV. When I went to complain to the hotel, they said that there was nothing they could do because there was construction going on next door. I tried 2 times to talk to a manager about getting some sort of compensation, but the manager had not been on duty. I called the hotel and spoke with the manager and he said that because I had gotten a low rate through Priceline ($107 before taxes) that they couldnt compensate me anymore. They did offer to give me a discount the next time I stayed there, and I explained to the manager thank you, but I will never stay there again. This should be rated a 1 star hotel. I do not recommend!!"
21,1756,"Dec 3 2008 	Nice -you get what you pay for location is worst feature	Clean, functional room. Good for a short stay where you will not be in the room very much. The location is bad (didn't feel unsafe, just not appealling), in a desolate area with construction and train noise once the sun comes up. So if you just need a clean, cheap place to sleep, don't mind an &quot;ugly&quot; location and can get a cheap price, this may be worth a try. I booked on Hotwire so wasn't sure what hotel I would get until I paid. I've done better for about the same price in NYC."
22,1756,Nov 1 2008	Bed Bugs	I am pretty positive I brought home bed bugs from this hotel. They started infesting my apartment around the same time we got home from our vacation. They have made our lives a nightmare.
23,1756,"Sep 16 2008	Good hotle	We stayed in the hotel for 5 nights.Rooms are more than OK, not too small. it depens on what you seek. If you just seek a place to sleep this is a great hotel. Our room was always clean, fresh towells, fresh sheets etc etc.Breakfast was ok, no complains at all. Don't expect too much but it's goodThe neighbourhood is not unsafe, really we walked their at 2-3 AM, no probs at all. 10min walk from times square and subway.Fact is that they are working next to hotel so their is some noise very early but we never noticed it because we were so tired after a whole day of walking around the city :)If you want luxe you have to book the Hilton of the Plaza but you will also pay the prize.This is a very good for it's prize (if you compare with others) hotel with hard working people. Great for tourists"
24,1756,Sep 10 2008 	Thieves in the room	When we checked in I foolishly mentioned that we'd just been to Mexico City. We got to our room and the room safe was locked closed. We called the front desk to report it and they said they would take care of it that evening or the next day. We hid our passports in our clothes and went out to dinner. When we got back our passports were gone. The keys are of the card type and are renewed upon each check in.
25,1756,"Sep 3 2008 	First time in New York	If you are out and about you don't need a room at the Ritz, this hotel will serve your purpose. We stayed for 5 nights and returned each night to sleep and plan our next day. Rooms were clean but on the small side, the breakfast had a good selection and the walk to downtown was average distance. Made my way around to a play, the US open tennis and the David Letterman Show. Would love to return to Manhattan and would have no problem staying again at this location."
26,1756,"Aug 27 2008 	Very convenient for a tourist stay in NYC	I book a room for 4 people. Two adults and two teenagers.The hotel is well located and good price compared to other hotel of NYC. The staff is very kind and works very hard. The breakfast is good.Only drawbacks: the only lift is very slow and the rooms are not large but the beds are comfortable. 10 minutes to reach the subway. A recommendation is to use the taxi by night, it's cheap : 7US$ from time square to the hotel and it's more safe.By the small window, you can see the river. Wifi is for free in the hotel and there is a safety box."
27,1756,"Aug 24 2008 	A great hotel; Not the greatest location	I stayed at the Best Western Convention Center Hotel in New York City from August 15 - 22, 2008. I visit New York City almost every summer for about a week, and was a bit scared when I got this hotel through Priceline. The hotel itself is quite nice. The bed was comfortable, and the room wasn't too small. The best part about staying here was the free breakfast and free hi-speed internet. Internet is available at a terminal in the lobby, or you can borrow an ethernet cable to use with your laptop in your room. Breakfast was available between 7 and 10am, and consisted of various cereals, bagels, toast, danishes, muffins, apples and bananas, orange juice, apple juice and coffee. Simple, but just what you need to get you going in the morning.The location of the hotel was a bit of a downside. It took me almost half and hour to walk to one of the Broadway shows one evening just because there were so many people around. The hotel is located southwest of Times Square on 38th street at 10th Avenue. The neighbourhood isn't unsafe, but I'd avoid walking near the Port Authority. Lots of homeless people around there at night. I felt it was a bit far from many things. If you have problems walking, don't stay here. If you don't mind a good walk (I walked everywhere, from the hotel to the Guggenheim in the upper 80's, and to the southern tip of Manhattan Island), this hotel isn't so bad.There are many more centrally located hotels, but if you don't mind walking, this is an affordable alternative."
28,1756,"Aug 6 2008 	MIRROR FELL ON TOP OF HUSBAND AND IT WAS PUT ON THE BILL!	My husband was going to take a shower before retiring for the evening. There was no rubber bath mat nor was there a towel type mat in the bathroom. A set of towels for each of us was provided, with no extra towel. He looked at the bottom of the tub, and there were faint gray ovals on the bottom of the tub. He assumed that this meant that it was a non-slip surface by looking at it, especially since no mat was provided. He turned on the water, and then started to get into the shower. His foot slipped out from under him and he fell heavily to the floor, taking the shower curtain and its rings with him. He fell with such force that the mirror fell from the wall above the sink, broke against the edge of the sink, and then landed on top of him. (The mirror was attached to the wall with only two small flat clips.) Small pieces of the mirror cut his chest, legs, hands, and near his ear. These were all small cuts, nothing major, and I always pack band-aids just to be on the safe side. Luckily he was not badly hurt, especially when you are talking about a 61 year old man falling in the manner that he did. I called the front desk and told them what had happened. A gentleman came up and tried to clean up the shards from the mirror, but there were small pieces that he was unable to get up with the broom. I called the front desk while he was in the room and asked if we could move to another room since the bathroom floor wasnt safe to walk on without shoes, but I was told that no other room was available that evening. The man who came to help us got us a new shower curtain and brought up some ceiling tiles to put on the floor along with some extra towels. He couldnt find any shower curtain rings, so he brought me some pieces of string for me to use to put the shower curtain up. I had cleaned up the blood with the wash cloth and he told me to just put that in the trash can, which I did. The next morning I went down to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. I was told that he would not be in until Monday morning. Our phone number was taken down and I was given a card with the hotel information on it. I asked the man at the desk to please let housekeeping know that the floor really needed to be carefully mopped since there were still tiny pieces of mirror on the floor. This was done. No new shower curtain rings were put up; the mirror was not replaced. We were given a towel type bath mat.On Sunday morning we went to the front desk to check out and were told that a $130 charge for the mirror and a $10 charge for the curtain rings were added to our bill since we broke them. Once again I went through the entire account, and the young woman then removed the charges, but we were told that they might be put back on our bill on Monday. I reiterated that we wanted the manager to call us. Our daughter noticed that the notes that were sitting on the front desk had highlighted the statement that we broke the mirror, not that there was a fall and the mirror fell off the wall and broke on top of my husband.. This entire ordeal has left us extremely disappointed with Best Western Hotels. To begin with, this event never should have occurred. You either provide your guests with a bath mat of some sort, or your tubs have non-slip surfaces. You should also mount your mirrors with a stronger type of anchoring system than what was used. If and when an unfortunate event like this does occur, you do not bill your guests for damages that occurred through no fault of their own. We were upset that this happened to him to begin with, and billing us for the mirror and shower curtain rings made matters a hundred times worse. All that my husband wanted to do was take a shower safely. That certainly is not too much to ask of a hotel.The manager has yet to call us, and it is over a week since this happened. He told the Best Western people to say that he was sorry. They have also asked him repeatedly to call us. The charges were not added back on to the bill, and the owner did not make any other adjustment to our charges to compensate us for this. I can't imagine what would have happened if he had broken his hip when he fell."
29,1756,"Jul 27 2008	Misleading Best Western - Parking almost a mile away	This place was absolutely horrible! I read a few reviews, and thought I'd take a chance because I usually like the Best Western brand and enjoy earning points for my stays.However, I would not recommend this place. Just as the other reviewers stated, the hotel is in an isolated area of Manhattan. It's just 2 blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel exit, and I wouldn't recommend walking to/from the hotel at night. Parking was the worst part. You leave the keys with Central Parking, the official parking for this Best Western hotel, and you walk 2 schleps (which are 2x regular city blocks), plus another 2.5 blocks to get to this hotel. The sidewalks you have to use to get to the hotel are all blocked off, under construction, or have potholes in them (I know - strange for sidewalks to have holes in them!). It's a long walk, and the hotel staff 'forgot' to mention this. Instead, they said, &quot;Oh it's not far away at all.&quot;It was.Also, the nearest subway station is just about as far as the parking lot, and the station is next to a NYPD police station -- so you can imagine the riftraft hanging near there after being released. I would highly, highly recommend staying at another hotel, even if it's pricier, because the inconvenience and lack of service at this hotel is not worth its 'low' price. Oh - and parking is an additional $30 by the way, which is NOT included in your hotel rate/stay. The hotel staff didn't even know where the nearest cabs were, nor did they have names or phone numbers so that we could call a cab...totally useless staff."
30,1756,"Jul 20 2008 	Stay here only if you are DESPERATE	The All Star Game was being played in New York and every hotel room was taken, or so it seemed according to my travel agent. I was booked at this hotel. The people at the desk are nice and helpful. The problem is the room. It is essentially 12 feet by 12 feet.. no exaggeration. The bed, desk, lamps, chair and closet are all crowded into that little tiny. area. The hotel is located across from a 24/7 car repair shop that fixes New York cabs all night long so the tire machines and all the other related machinese are banging all night long. The Amtrak train track runs alonside the hotel so all the trains go up and down and you hear all that noise as well, in addition to New York's Finest Fireman racing to a fire and blaring their sirens as they go. The firehouse is only a block away. You don't have to go to Broadway for entertainment. You will get it live and in concert all night long.. I fully guarantee it."
31,1756,"Jul 17 2008 	Hated this hotel	This is the last time I will use Priceline. For $179 a night, I dont think its too much to expect a clean place. This is a dirty run down hotel with EXTREMELY cramped rooms and very worn everything. But worse is the location, in the middle of a block of buildings all at various stages of construction, and with trains, trucks etc. running all night and a very noisy mechanics place right opposite the entrance. There are no restaurants or shops nearby and one has to walk a couple of blocks even to find a taxi, which do not cruise past the hotel. Under no circumstances would I recommend staying here."
32,1756,"Jul 9 2008 	Good value cheerful staff and isolated location	The Best Western Convention Centre Hotel (BWCCH) is great value if you pay less than $200/night. I booked the BWCCH through Priceline and bid (and paid) $150/night. May sure you try even a lower bid, as others have paid less.Yes, as with other reviews, I was quite sad when I got the reply from Priceline that I got the BWCCH. Having lived in Manhattan and visited a number of times, I had no idea the BWCCH even existed. It really is in the middle of no where, except for being a block from the Jarvits Convention Centre. It's a very fast 12 minute walk to the A, C &amp; E subway line, which you can enter at 40th street and 8th avenue. I never felt unsafe walking back at 1 a.m. in the morning, but the area was quite deserted.I stayed in Room 1104 (top floor, 2 double beds). The room is actually quite a bit bigger than other Manhattan hotel rooms which I've stayed (in particular the minature-sized 30-30 Hotel). The bathroom is nice, clean and modern. The bed and mattress was very comfortable. I did notice that I got a few bites on my arms during my stay - not sure if it was bed bugs or something else I came into contact with during my stay in Manhattan.The free breakfast was okay. It consisted of: cereal, milk, juice, muffins, apples, bananas, doughnuts and bagels. It was not spectacular; rather, it did the trick until late lunch. I thought the coffee made in the hotel room tasted better than the free breakfast coffee.The location of the hotel is the main reason why I did not rate my experience as a 4 out of 5. Just being so deserted and isolated, made the walk back to the hotel very lonely and depressing. Be prepared for a walk if you stay here or paying a lot for taxis. The hotel and rooms are fine, clean and the staff is friendly. The cleaning staff even left me a 'thank-you' note when I left a small tip on the bed. The cleaning staff did a great job. Yes, for the right price and the right time of year (not winter or super hot summer months) I would stay here again."
33,1756,"Jul 9 2008 	Good hotel for short stay those who don't mind walking	My husband and I stayed over the 4th of July weekend. The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly upon check-in. The location is not too convenient unless you are using the convention center. Rooms are a reasonable size for a New York City hotel. Bathrooms are small, but very nice and clean. We loved the bed - it had a memory foam mattress and was extremely comfortable. The noise from the trains and the shop across the street did not bother us, but it probably helped that we always take a white noise machine with us to hotels.Neighborhood is industrial, but not unsafe. Some of the reviews have said the neighborhood is dangerous, but we did not feel that way. You can definitely smell the horses from the barn next door, but not for long as we didn't hang out outside the hotel and went on our way. On future visits, I would prefer to stay elsewhere, but mostly for location."
34,1756,"Jul 5 2008 	Exceeded expectations a bit like a ""boutique"" hotel	I wasn't so happy when I first got this hotel on Priceline. Web reviews were horrible and the neighborhood is full of car repair shops. No character there! However, I was more than pleasantly surprised and I would definitely stay there again. If you are at the Javits Center, it is only one-half block walk. The horse-drawn carriages are prepared out front so if you like horses you will be in heaven. The hotel is new, very clean, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the fourth floor room by the elevator was the quietest I have ever had in NYC. The included breakfast was great for a continental style, lots of choices including fresh croissants, fruit, cereal, juices, doughnuts etc. The room had coffeemaker, safe and iron and ironing board. It is a quick and easy walk to Macy's, Penn Station, Madison Square Garden area. The hotel was filled with European travelers, my last day I finally met a family from Kentucky. They also loved the small boutique feeling that this Best Western offers. The only downs were the small room (I shared with a friend, we had two twins pushed together like a king) and the view. I'll be back!"
35,1756,"Jun 18 2008 	Below average	Good points:1) Somewhat close to Penn Station, where I entered the city.2) Relatively clean, but nowhere near pristine. About what I expected at this price.Bad points:1) They claimed that they were giving me a queen sized bed, but in fact, they took a queen sized headboard and put two twin beds together. This alone was pretty unacceptable, but when we approached the front desk, they were unhelpful and just said that all of their queen beds are like that. Are you serious??2) Nothing of interest within 5 blocks of this place. About what I expected at this price.3) Continental breakfast was pretty lousy. Again, what I expected at this price.Other points:1) The hotel is kind of off the beaten trail, and there is major construction being done next to the hotel. It isn't terribly well-lit, but I never really felt unsafe walking back to the hotel at 3am. That said, if I were a female and alone, I would exercise a little bit of caution.2) Only one elevator for the entire hotel. It's a smaller hotel but it went out for a little while when we were leaving and we had to walk down 10 flights of stairs.3) If you could get a room for $100/night (taxes included), I would probably recommend this hotel. However, I don't really know if that's a feasible price point. They advertise for roughly $220/night plus taxes, which is outrageous. I would stay in 20 other hotels in the city before this one at ~$260/night.Summary:I don't think I would stay here again, if only because of the bed situation. It's pretty sleazy to advertise a queen bed and then let your guests find out that they just mashed two twin beds together. I'd rather spend my money to stay somewhere in a nicer area."
36,1756,"May 19 2008 	Would not stay here again! Bad neighborhood	The continental breakfast is not worth going down for. Although this is just a minor bit of why I wouldn't stay here again. If you are a tourist looking for a great place to stay, do not stay here. Too dangerous for tourists. If you are here for the convention, great location, but I rather stay at Travel Inn just a few streets down. Much better service and quality.I specifically called to make sure my guests name was on the reservation, which the operator confirmed. However, they did not update the hotel or it was not in the system. Therefore, my guest who arrived earlier then I did had a great problem checking in AND the front desk employees could not understand what we were explaining. But in the end, my guest pretended to be me, and then was able to check in. Which makes me weary because his ID was definitely not a girls name, but they still let him check in. What if he was a stranger. I am glad though, because otherwise since the operator made the mistake he might have been homeless. Since the operator didn't correctly update the reservation, an important package we had delivered to the hotel was refused and caused a great deal of stress to our business. My only other complaint is the noise level, which I didn't report because there was not much the hotel can do. The train is right outside our window and every time the train went by (which was early hours of the morning and throughout the day) it was very loud and we couldn't sleep. I loved the location although the surroundings were dangerous and smelly (due to the horses), but very close to the convention center. There is a strip club right next door which made me nervous to be outside alone and a 24 hour auto shop which made a lot of noise. Overall due to the miscommunication and surrounding neighborhood, I would not stay here again."
37,1756,"May 18 2008	very basic and clean	The BW Convention Center is a very basic hotel that is a few blocks away from Broadway and Macy's. It is in an industrial area, but only a couple of blocks from 9th avenue where there are some reasonable restaurants. We booked our room through hotwire. It was the least expensive hotel we could find in midtown that had a private bath. We drove to the hotel and were directed to park at a lot 3 blocks away at a &quot;discounted&quot; rate of $30 a night. The hotel is just a place to crash at night. Not somewhere you would want to relax in. It is right across the street from a 24 hour garage. Our room faced the street and it was a bit noisy. I would ask for a room on the other side next time. The room was clean but small with basic furnishings. I felt the hotel was secure and the area safe to walk around despite the industrial feel of the area. For those on a budget it is fine."
38,1756,"Apr 18 2008 	Nice hotel!	Got the hotel on Hotwire, so we actually not selected it ourselves.Paid 179 dollar + taxes for three persons (one weeks stay). Must be a good price on Manhattan. Stayed on the 11:th floor. It was rather small but very clean and neat. The Tempura mattresses was comfortable and it was nice to have a safe for money and tickets. The bathroom was very good.The breakfast was better than expected. There were fresh fruits, boiled eggs and cereals and lots of sweets like donuts and muffins (and people had it for breakfast!?)The staff didnt great you mornings and evenings, exept for the cleaningladies. A little bit rude I think.There where no protestors the week we stayed.We thought the neighborhood was safe.We are very pleased with our stay and had a wonderful week in New York!"
39,1756,"Mar 29 2008 	Terrible experience with the hotel never again.	I have booked the hotel from hotels.com for my family vacation. We paid for 220.00/night for two nights, plus 100 for an additional person. The room is so small, no space for the luggages.. We have to put the luggage on the top of the chair. There is train path close to the hotel, each night, we would be waked up few times by the passing train noises. For price over $300.00 for the condition in NYC, it is much over priced.Our terrible experience came to the day of check out. First of all, it was our mistake remembering wrong check out date. We thought the check out date was 28 but it actually was 27.We came back to hotel at around 8:00PM, and the room was locked out. We came to the front desk and were told that we already passed the check out time, and would be charged a full day rate for the day and let us leave immediately. I talked to the on site manager that it was a mistake we made, and If we charged the full day rate, we should have the room for the night. But the manager told me that all the rooms were sold out, I can not get any room. I thought that the person who booked our room had not checked in yet, if we move out at this time, we actually not cause any financial lose to the hotel, I asked for a discount/half day charge if we can not stay at the night. I get refused, too. I asked to speak to the senior manager, The on-site manager talked to the senior manager over the phone, and told me that the senior manager was angry and yelling at him, so the price increased from 299.00 to 375.00 due to my asking for talking to the senior manager. This is ridicules! The total charge is 428.65 include tax for the late check out and we even can not have the room for the night! We have tried to talked to the on site manager for the matter until 10:00PM, then we have to drive out to find the new hotel for us for the night, we get a room in Super 8 at around 1:30 AM, a night mere to us for the New York trip. I found a lot of negative reviews to this hotel after I back home, and very regret did not read the reviews before booking. My advise to travelers is that read the review, the negative review has its reason and verify the check out date very carefully. Best Western Convention Center Hotel got an extra $428.65 from me for my vacation (They have a good profit for the room, a total charge over $800.00 for both my penalty and the new book for a single day with a motel level room), but they will lose my business forever include all my relatives &amp; friends.Wish you have a nice trip!"
40,1756,"Mar 27 2008 	Nice	We were really concerned after reading recent reviews of this hotel, but we found it to be a nice, relatively inexpensive place to spend the weekend. We did not see any protestors. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful, and our requests for a room change (first room was right next to the elevator) and extra linens were quickly met. We thought the location was great. We walked everywhere, and never felt unsafe. There was a large event at the convention center that might have accounted for more foot traffic in the area, but buildings across the street were occupied at all hours. Our room was clean and comfortable, with a great mattress. It was smaller than average, but we didn't feel cramped, and had plenty of room for our things and ourselves.There is quite a bit of construction next door during the week, but it did not bother us at all, and our room was on the side of the building closest to the site. We could sometimes hear noise from the auto shop across the street, but on the 5th floor it was not enough to keep us awake. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay, and would recommend the hotel to others."
41,1756,"Mar 15 2008 	nice hotel- protestors a problem	i looked this hotel becuase the price was right at the time. Sor for the Pros:The room are nice and comfortable, but the rooms with the queens size bed is small- tight fit. Rooms were cleaned and bathrooms were also clean- no smells or problems with cleanliness. Room were stocked well everyday and cleaning ladies were nice but didnt know much english. Continestial breakfast was good and price per night were also well ranged. Cons:Arrived to hotel and the location was in the middle of other industrial buildings- all shopping areas, restuarants, attractions were a good walk away about 15 min walking. Scary to walk at night- would not recommend it- take a taxi if you can- you will be luck to even find a taxi going thru that street since its not a usual pick up place. you would have to walk to the main street. Also what may make you uneasy is a group of protestors outside that are screaming and bugging you as you walk in and out the hotel ( some workers compensation thing)- im all for rights- but it gets annoying... the door man is very helpfull in assisting you in and out constantly saying ignore them. Front desk attendents are not as friendly as you would expect- they really dont go out of thier way for you as a customer except for a young lady who was always very nice and helpful. Overall stay was not bad, however not to its potential- the price is good for a place to stay with comfortable rooms and if you can black out the minors things and walk the distance everyday.. do it!"
42,1756,"Mar 5 2008 	Excellent value	I paid about $115 including taxes for a night during the week. The room was very clean and the furnishings were new. It was very basic and a very small room but more than worth the price. Free breakfast (didn't eat it though), free newspaper, coffee maker in room, and in room safe.The only drawback with this hotel is that it is about 8 blocks from the subway. Some women might not feel comfortable walking alone at night in the neighborhood. There isn't much activity at night because the nearby business have shut down. There did appear to be some ongoing labor dispute against the hotel (signs up outside), and maybe that was the reason for the cheap rate. The quality of the service was fine (front desk and housekeeping).I would definitely stay here again."
43,1756,"Feb 20 2008 	Satisfied with experience	I got my two rooms from priceline and so I didn't actually select this hotel. I was wary about what to expect since I read the other reviews. However, the hotel was exactly what a 3-star hotel is: clean rooms (booked a single and also a double room), continental breakfast (toast, bagels, small muffins, juices/teas, donuts until 10am), competent and polite staff (they speak English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese apparently), and basic room amenities (small shampoo, lotion, soap, wet wipes). Some previous reviews talked about worker protests, but apparently no protesters on weekends or weekday evenings. The neighborhood is at the border or Hell's Kitchen and Chelsea. Its about 6 blocks to the two closest subway stations or a $5-$6 cab ride to Times Square or Central Park. Wouldn't recommend females to walk around neighborhood alone, but it's fine during the daytime."
44,1756,"Feb 6 2008 	enjoyed stay	Just got back from a long weekend stay here. We were greeted by the protester! but the nice doorman helped us with our luggage and kept him away. The protesters consist of 2 maybe 3 ex employees who were unhappy with their treatment by the management at the hotel, they say shame on u for staying here, and get your money back but thats it, just walk on in and they leave you alone and they were gone all weekend! Once inside the hotel was pretty basic, but it was clean. The room was fairley average but again cleaned with coffee machine, telephones, hairdryer, iron/ironing board and a safe. Fresh towels daily and the room cleaned and made up fresh. The staff were very helpfull, helped us book trips, recommended where to eat and what to see, even took time to point places out on maps and circle them to show us how to get there. Would stay here again.Great location 5 - 10min walk to times square and idealy located for you to see the sights of new york."
45,1756,"Jan 16 2008 	Depends	Location: Be OK in summer - 15 minutes walk to anywhere decent. In winter, when it's freezing and snowing, it seems to be a million miles away. The area is also quite grotty.Rooms: Tiny but modern and clean. If staying a few nights, should not be a problem.Service: Not the best. Wake up call two hours late - thank god my plane was delayed!!! Would I stay again: Probably not - only if it was summer and very cheap.Without a doubt better hotels for the price we paid."
46,1756,"Dec 16 2007	Shame on YOU!!!!	Let me start by saying I lived in NY for several years, and my husband and I decided to return for a visit. We booked our stay on priceline and ended up with this hotel. When we arrived we were greeted by a sole male protestor, who insulted me before I could get in the door. If you have thick skin this won't be a problem. Usually we found just one or two protestors would be in front everyday. They will yell &quot;shame on you!&quot; as you walk out the door. They have a giant inflatable rat outside too. We took a picture in front of it and they did not like it. Oh well. As for the hotel, it's comfortable, clean, and quiet. One of the bigger hotel rooms you will find in New York for the price. Yeah, it's a little bit of a walk to times sqaure, but it's a safe neighborhood. It really takes no more that 10 minutes to walk to the nearest subway. I recomend this place because it was very comfortable and low-key. I think the people who wrote the negative reviews are just used to higher-class hotels. For a two star hotel- it ain't bad!"
47,1756,"Nov 20 2007 	never again at the BW Convention Center	I can't believe I paid $300 for a night in this dump. The room was not unlike your standard motel room that you can get across the Country for $60/night, but this being crazy NYC I paid through my nose for paper-thin sheets, no wireless connection, and -hear this- a non-working telephone in the room. When I complained to the front desk a guy with clearly no hospitality management experience told me rudely to follow the instructions on the phone (like I can't read). When I called him again to let him know that the phone was just not working, he said: &quot;sorry, you will have to speak to the manager tomorrow &quot; and hung up on me.The next day I contacted the front desk again and they said they'd send someone to look at it shortly. Well, I didn't see anyone until I checked out an hour later. In short: never again, not at least for $300."
48,1756,"Nov 15 2007	not good at all	My spouse had booked the hotel online last minute. The price seemed good-but what a mistake. First of all, the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. The only other thing on the block is an auto repair and trucks. Oh, and people in a tent in front of the hotel. At first we thought it was some sort of bad joke, but everytime we'd come in we were heckled and harassed and yelled at by these people. The hotel employees didn't seem to care, and the elevator kept breaking. The hotel seemed dirty on top of everything else. Its one thing when things go wrong, but for such a short trip i still have a bad taste in my mouth. don't do it."

For what its worth this is a good hotel worth the price i would recommend this hotel to anyone , they were very accommodating with hints about the city and restaurants and tours.I would stay here again , also very close to jacob javits center for those convention goers and a short walk to times square and the empire state building .brian from iowa"
50,1756,"Nov 13 2007 	Not the best but not the worst	First, the good things. The staff was friendly and low key. I loved the internet access. The place is indeed new, if a bit small. The bed was firm, and the bathroom, clean. The bed won't kill you and they have continental breakfast if you like such food. I was ready for the neighborhood, in fact, I have been visiting New York every 2-3 years more than 30 years, and understand this is an industrial neighborhood, for tourists on a budget. There was plenty of parking on the street. I had no problem taking buses or the subway during my entire stay, and best of all I walked just one block to the convention center.The surroundings are drab to put it mildly. The term &quot;Industrial&quot; sugar-coats the fact that #1, there are no nearby restaurants until you walk to 9th ave, and #2, there are bags of trash waiting to be picked on the street. Sadly, the taxi driver will be able to locate the hotel faster if you tell him to look for a giant inflatable rat (the product of a labor dispute) in front of the building. Since the hotel sign is the tiniest I've ever seen on a Best Western, the rat makes a great landmark. At night, the lobby light provides the best illumination on W 38th street. Once inside the lobby, the flight of stairs right in front of you will prompt you to negotiate your luggage to the registration desk, without noticing an elevator to your right. Speaking of elevators, the hotel's only elevator broke during my stay, making me suddenly glad they had placed me on the sixth floor. It seems the company greedily crammed as many rooms as possible in the small frame of this hotel. The rooms are small. Don't expect a big lobby or anonymity. There isn't. The tiny breakfast area means you have to elbow your way to continental breakfast. I cannot complain about internet access. Their wi-fi was reliable and fast. I was there in November, and the cooling/heating system was clean and efficient, warming up the room almost instantly. For a hotel in this price range, the bed sheets, pillows (only 2) and cover were rough. The bed was firm if again, a bit small, it seemed like ours was a full instead of a queen size bed. The diminutive bathroom was clean, but there were mold spots in the tub's caulking in the two rooms I saw. In the 1st room the toilet sat strangely low for a person my size (5'4&quot;), in fact, my knees were higher than my rear end. The second room had a normal toilet. The best rooms are above the 8th floor, and look westward, since their biggest problem is noise. Not only is the hotel located right by some train tracks, I was awakened at 7:00 AM inside my north-facing room by construction sounds and the noise of the giant rat being inflated. There is a large construction site next to this lilliputian hotel.When I complained, the staff promptly found me another room one floor above. The second room was quieter because it faced south, and I was able to sleep in a bit.In short, if you're a small-framed business traveler who needs to be close to the Javitz, and if you need to be up before 7:00 AM to get to work, this is a good value. If you're a tourist, stay at The Pod. If you're a woman who plans to be out at night, this isn't a great choice."
51,1756,"Oct 30 2007 	Quite an unusual experience	The hotel itself was an oasis and quite nice. However, while it is close to Times Square, the walk is scary, especially at night. There is nothing else around it for at least two long city blocks except for a taxi repair shop, package shipping and bus storage. Everything else is torn down. I would not have wanted my wife to stay there by herself. Also, they were having ex-hotel workers protest all week when we were there. They had a big inflatable rat and approached us almost every time we entered or left the hotel--at least they were cordial."
52,1756,Oct 29 2007 	Don't stay Here	This place sucks! Giant rat in front people screaming at you everytime you go in or out. I know for New York this place is cheap but I paid $265.00 and others paid like $80.00. I got screwed big time. The place is not close to anything! What the hell where they thinking when they built it here. The staff seemed very uncomfortable about the whole thing. It's not thier fault! Will not ever stay there agian or close to it. The area is ok it's about eight blocks from anything! Not all that scary just industrial. Good luck to all that stay there and good luck to the people who work there.
53,1756,"Oct 24 2007 	Would not stay here again	The hotel is okay for the price but if my husband had not been with me I would not have stayed. The walk to it is iffy I was scared and weary of my surroundings even in the hotel itself. Then when we got there there was a protest because apparently the owners have mistreated some staff. I wish that was found somewhere before we booked there. I will never stay on the outskirts of manhatan again. And another thing I did not like was that after we checked in, we were outside our door when about 3 asian men came by and said our room number and we were like wha't sgoing on and it turns out they were changing the light bulbs and my husband was upset because who knows when or how many times they go into people's rooms to do maintenance. I'm sure that happens at other places as well but the way this happnened left too many things to the imagination. Well for the price it is OK but I will NEVER stay there again..."
54,1756,"Oct 23 2007 	On the fence	First the cons...the location isn't great -- you aren't really close to any sites and what you can see is pretty uninspiring (taxi garage, horse and buggies and lots of construction in the area) and the room was positively tiny yet seemed to cost a lot of money. You're also very close to the Lincoln Tunnel, so there's a lot of traffic during rush hours. On the positive side though, the rooms were fairly modern and very clean, the location was quiet and the staff, for the most part, was very friendly, informative and helpful. If you're just looking for a place to stay, and not overly concerned with the ambience, then you probably won't mind staying here."
55,1756,"Oct 15 2007 	Giant Inflatable Rat Says It All!	When we arrived, the hotel staff had all been fired and they were all protesting outside with a giant inflatable rat. The scene was very uncomfortable and I cancelled my reservation. The staff were all very impatient and didn't understand why we wouldn't want to stay. They were not accomodating in the least. The hotel is not in a good location, not very close to anything,and directly across the street from an auto garage and next to the horse stables for central park. Needless to say, we didn't stay there because of the horrible conditions and I don't recommend it to anyone."
56,1756,"Oct 8 2007 	good value	This was a busy holiday weekend in NYC and because we had made reservations relatively late, this hotel had a reasonable rate for this particular weekend. The rooms were a bit small, but certainly adequate and above all, clean. Everything was in good working order and the front desk staff were absolutely wonderful and very accommodating and helpful. I had no problems with the hotel itself although the street it is on is not pretty. There are repair garages for taxis and a trucking business and the train goes by at times. There are restaurants a short distance away and parking is in a big garage a block away and is reasonably priced if you go to the garage that the hotel recommends. I would go back to this hotel only because the staff were great!"
