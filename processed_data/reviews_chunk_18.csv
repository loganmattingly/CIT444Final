176,402,"Jul 16 2009	food police	Had to change rooms twice, each time waited 20 mins in line. Waited ten mins for a drink at the brew pub while staff chats to one and only customer about how good they look for their age ( happened at least two other bars in hotel) Pool bar charges $10 for two bottles of water. They check your room key at the pool gate which is good but they also check your bag . I thought this was also for security but found out they are looking for food , after buying two ice creams FROM THE HOTEL and taking them to the pool I was stopped and told I could not eat them by the pool. I stood there in 40 degree heat with ice cream running down my arms unable to reach my sister to tell her to come out to eat and unable to go in. I argued there are no signs anywere about this rule and. I then asked for the reasons, because it was not for hygiene because people are drinking creamy cocktails and rainbow ice drinks in the pool spilling them and leaving a nice foamy scum around the edge of the water for you to swim in, could the reason be they want you to buy the very expensive food and drink from the pool bar. Pool area was filthy ,put my bag on the floor and was covered in stains, clothes dirty from the beds ,swam twice in seven days because pool packed out with lots of people just standing in the pool waving drinks about, sun beds all reserved at 9am but no one around until lunch time . Sat and watched as people forced to eat quickly standing up or throw food away, even families with small children had to throw away snax bought from the hotel shop, one woman was turned away bacause she had an apple. The loud rock music started at 9AM and got louder through the day, The rooms and the hotel was shabby and scruffy and house keeping done as little as possible. Lots of what look like drunk teenagers running around screaming and shouting. Most of the staff were rude apart from the buffet staff. Paid alot of money for what is supposed to be an ok hotel , feel cheated and ruined my birthday trip"
177,402,"Jul 16 2009 	Friendly clean and a bargain	Despite the construction going on in and around the hotel, we really enjoyed our stay. It's not the swankiest of rooms (mainly the bed linens are okay, but not great), but when you're spending so little, what do you expect? It was very clean, and the casino is one of the less frenetic ones on the strip. There's plenty of space and light, and the dealers are nice. The casino also does not have a strong odor (neither of smoke nor cloying air fresheners). We were in Vegas to meet up with family. We checked in first. We were on a different floor from my parents and, after spending a night in our original room, we asked if we could move to their floor, which promptly happened.I would be happy to stay here on a return trip."
178,402,"Jul 16 2009 	Wanted to love it... but they didn't want my love!	Okay, I wanted to try staying at the Monte Carlo because it seemed to be a little more upscale than the NYNY next door, where I've stayed twice. I was hit with disappointment the second I arrived. The entire MC parking structure was CLOSED to guests! They were using it for construction workers for City Center! I had to park out on the hot sun and walk about 200 yards with my heavy bags, through lots of traffic on the side alley. Valet was very packed the whole time I was there, and I hate leaving my nice car with valets.Also, like the Mirage, they have this strange check-in area, where there is no single line, and you just stand in front of each desk clerk. I had several other people walk up and get their rooms while I waited.The elevator banks are close by though, and I had one that serviced just the upper rooms. The hallway to the room was very sparse, with no decoration or feel that you are at the Monte Carlo. The room was the same and it made the NYNY look like The Palms! Nothing special about the room at all. It had most of the normal amenities, but these days hotels in Vegas should be offering something beyond &quot;normal&quot;, especially for the higher rates I paid.Most of this average quality was to be found in other areas too. The pool area was packed every day of my 4 night stay, and I got the last chair each time I went. It would have been a nice pool area were it not for the loud music which made talking to your waitress almost impossible. The river they have is nice, but you need to get rid of half the people in order to have a nice swim not getting bumped into. I heard they are letting people from the NYNY use the MC's pool.Gambling, the buffet and coffee shop were also nothing special, though the service was above average. Diablo's, right out front, had great fajitas and a great view of the Strip. We ate at Andre's and had a 4 Star meal. Had the sea bass and it was worth every penny! But they would not let me open a bottle of expensive wine I'd brought. They didn't have corkage at all. The front desk clerk had given us a $25 off card to use, so once again, the service is great but some policies need to change. We ended up buying a pair of cheap wine glasses and drinking out on the steps right on the Strip!I also tried Brand, which is their steak place, but it is right off the side of the casino and open to it. Smelled lots of cigarette smoke throughout dinner. The burgers were good, but the servers are a little young for such high prices.The overall crowd at the MC was younger than I had expected and it proved that Vegas has lots of visitors. If I ran the Monte Carlo I would demand shuttles, buses or carpools for the construction workers, thus giving MC guests back their parking structure. I would also create a single check-in line, add special amenities to the rooms, lower the music at the pools, or have a separate area for adults who want more peace and quiet.Until then I'm not really able to recommend the MC."
179,402,"Jul 15 2009 	Very nice room at a very good price.	The service was excellent, location great, and check in was a breeze."
180,402,"Jul 14 2009 	I will be back	I travel to Vegas yearly, and I will have to say that the Monte Carlo is a very classy hotel at reasonable rates. I have stayed here the past two years and found the hotel to be clean, and staff to be very helpful. The rooms are not extravagant, but they are clean and very nice. Look forward to my next trip to Vegas, and the Monte Carlo!!!!"
181,402,"Jul 13 2009 	Stay Away	I had hear pretty good things about this hotel but, that was not the case at all. I don't find myself to be a picky traveler. The customer service was horrible. The front desk was not knowledgeable. They were rude and not helpful. I felt like they were doing me the favour by allowing me to stay there. I have been to Vegas many times and never had an experience quite like this one. This will be the last time that I stay at an MGM property."
182,402,"Jul 13 2009 	Really enjoyed our time at Monte Carlo	Just returned from a great stay at Monte Carlo. We try to get out to vegas once a year and was a little nervous after reading reviews. Previous trips we've stayed at Venetian, MGM, and Caesars. Monte Carlo sent us a deal that was too good to pass up and we really enjoyed our stay. We'd definitely stay here again. We loved the layout of the MC. It was very easy to get around. When you come down from the room, you have the main lobby, pool, casino, and food court all right there. The other hotels you have to walk a mile to get around. The room was average but we didn't care at all. We generally left the room at 9am and didn't go to bed until after 1am. We slept, showered, and changed at the room. I've seen some bad reviews on beds but ours was fine and comfortable. Our room was the last one on the 27th floor so noisy neighbors and construction wasn't an issue. Another good piece of advice we took from previous reviews was bringing tubes for the lazy river with us. I think my wife bought some for under $5 compared to renting or buying at the pool. only negative I had was you couldn't sit on the edge of the pool with a drink. This is the only hotel I've been too where i couldn't drink a beer sitting on side of pool. So instead of running up a $75 bar tab per day at the pool, i bought one beer in four days b/c I didn't want to drink it sitting in my chair. As I said, we'd definitely stay here again. It's not as nice as the other hotels we've stayed, but for the price it was great. We averaged $50/night (Wed-Sat night) and would stay at the MC all the time for that rate."
183,402,"Jul 13 2009 	hotel staff not friendly	Hotel is mediocre. Room is dark and not well ventilated. Mattress is way too soft. The hotel staff is not friendly at all. Called and asked for direction to the gym, got rude answer and hung up. Will not stay here again."
184,402,"Jul 13 2009 	Poor Service for a Strip Hotel	First review for us and it must be said that this service in the Casino is the worst I have ever seen in Las Vegas. We will not spend our money at this Casino tommorrow. The staff is rude and their is no atmosphere that makes playing fun. Spent nearly 30 minutes before we got service at the craps table for drinks. Video poker was even worse, the bartender spent his time NOT delivering drinks. The place is just dead and absolutely no fun! Isn't Vegas about fun? Do not stay or play here!!!Oh, the Diablo Cantina is a great place to eat and hang...that is it!!"
185,402,"Jul 7 2009 	amenities were ok customer service was horrible	I had booked my room ahead of time and prepaid and when I checked in they only had me down for 2 of my 3 reserved rooms. Fortunately I was able to pull up my confirmation emails on my phone and show them I had indeed booked 3 rooms. Once I arrived at my room, the shower was awfull. In addition, the maids did not clean the bathroom or room very well, I found garbage on the floor by the window and the shower had hair smeared on the tile side when I arrived. However, the maids did manage to lift an item of clothing from my room. When I filed a report about it I was treated rudely by the &quot;risk management&quot; staff and not compensated. I was told they sent me a letter of apology and when I said I hadn't received it I was rudely asked if I had &quot;checked my mail recently&quot;. To say the least I was not at all impressed with my stay and I will never go back. oh and you had to pay to use the hotel gym."
186,402,"Jul 7 2009 	good location 	The hotel was in a good location of the Strip. The room was a tad dated but very clean &amp; comfortable. The maid service was adequate also. The pool was overcrowded (being summer &amp; all, no surprise) but we managed to have a good time relaxing there &amp; ordering some decent poolside cocktails &amp; food. The beds were real comfortable..after an evening of walking the Strip, you want a comfy bed to go to."
187,402,"Jul 6 2009 	Great Stay- Pool makes it all worth it!	We were hesitant to book this hotel for a 3 night stay over the 4th of July weekend. I feel that this review is needed to balance the bad reviews. Our experience was great. Overall, the staff was very helpful and friendly, the hotel room (while fairly basic and small) was clean and had a nice view of the srip. We stayed in a deluxe high floor strip view room and it was quiet and the beds were fine. The pool was the best part! You do have to get there early to get a chair- if you do, you should have no problems finding chairs together.Pro's- Wave pool- while kind of small, it is lots of fun- The lazy river is swift and fun- You can bring your own raft to the pool. You can also rent one of their rafts, but it's cheaper to buy one at walgreens which is nearby. The pool attendants are also happy to blow it up for you- again, very good service- Pool drink service was fast and someone always came by. The food by the pool was also good.- There's a regular pool as well- mainly adults in this pool. We had a 6 year old with us, so we used the wave pool and lazy river mainly.- Pool area can get croweded, but don't let that deter you- it's fine- Pool hours are the same in most of the big hotels- this one closes at 7. Some others close at 6 (it's vegas, go figure)- Live DJ at the pool. The music is loud, but not terrible. Even with a hangover you should be ok.- There's a store in the lobby- has all your essentials you could need- Food court in the hotel (McDonalds, Starbucks, Rubios, etc)- great for a quick bite- Fast elevators- easy check-in and check-out- fast valet service- pretty good location on the strip- especially if traveling with kids- it's close to excalibur and M&amp;M world, etcCon's:- Room pretty small, but adequate- Halls could use some touching up- Room service trays left out for a few days- Food and service at their cafe was just ok- and prices pretty high- Casino was ok- I've been to better and worseAll in all, I would say that this was a very kid-friendly and nice hotel. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a hotel with a great pool and a clean room with a nice view. Don't worry about the bad reviews- I couldn't find anything really bad with this hotel- and I am a tough critic."
188,402,"Jul 5 2009 	Nothing to write home about but does the job	Really decent price for a hotel that is relatively close to some of the better casinos. Accommodations are pretty standard but much better than I expected for $40 a night! Bed was comfortable and room was clean, water pressure good. I didn't spend much time there anyway =)"
189,402,"Jul 3 2009 	Great Location - Ok Casino - Staff ""ok""	So my girlfriend and I stayed at the Monte Carlo in late June. We booked a Tues-Sat for $42 a night. Couldnt really beat it. My other family were staying at the Mandalay Bay and the Hard Rock. So we were in close proxemity to them all.So we arrived and checked it. We were glad to see the casino was easy to navigate. It's kinda just like a straight line, not crazy halls and turns everywhere. This was probably my fave part of the palce. Didnt have to look hard to find my family.We didnt really eat there, so i cant comment on the food.The rooms were pretty blah. Nothing special, but nothing wrong either. It wokred out. I dont know how I'd feel about paying more/night. But for what we paid we were very happy. Great location, ok service, and ok rooms."
190,402,Jul 1 2009 	Not all that	The location of this hotel is good. The rooms were small.The only poor service i would elaborate on was the hair dryer had stopped working and someone came to replace a new one on the wall (at a bad time). They were to come back and never did. So the remainder of the visit I had the dryer sittin on the counter. The room was plain as jane. The bathroom fixtures were old. There was nothing elaborate about the room. You had to pay for the internet and local calls. The money taken in of this place is spent in the casino and making it look appealing on the outside. I wouldn't stay here again.
191,402,"Jul 1 2009 	No Thanks!	The location of this hotel is great for most activities in Las Vegas.The hotel itself is however not good at all. Its old and worn. Cleaning was ok, as long as you dont look under the bed. ( I did..)If you like really bad tvreception, doorkeys that work perhaps every third time and plumbing that wakes up the whole floor then this is the perfect hotel for You. As an added bonus You get a boring casino and a not working players club. And ofcourse they lost my membership information for the players club and almost accused me of stealing a card.Internet access at $14.99 per 24h period is an insult even though it seemed quite fast. The only really good thing was the staff for check in/out and the poolarea."
192,402,"Jul 1 2009 	Monte Carlo - Good Enough	This review is long overdue.  We had a wonderful family reunion which included family members from Montreal, Toronto, LA and Santa Barbara. All fifteen of us stayed at the Monte Carlo. What got the ball rolling was the fact that my brother-in-law won a free five day trip to LV through work for his family, so we decided to join. Managed to get a fabulous rate of $59 for the first 3 nights, then $129 on the week-end. Having stayed at the Venetian two years aga ( first time in Vegas) , I was leary about such a stepdown. Here are my impressions: Firstly, the size of the hotel was a huge plus. It was wonderfully manageable. No walking for fifteen minutes just to reach the front desk. No big hustle and bustle in the lobby and common areas. This made sense since there is no big attraction here drawing the crowds. No theme. Just a nice marble lobby.Check in was a bit dicey upon arrival. My sister requested that we all be on the same floor. Instead, we ended up on different floors. Staff response was rather icey and not apologetic in the least. We decided not to move in the end. Too much hastle.Room: Clean. Decent enough furnishings. Came nowhere close to our suite at the Venezia Tower. Bathroom was fine. One big problem - the beds were awful (we had two Queens). I told everyone it felt like we were sleeping on water beds - filled halfway! Lumpy, soupy, lightweight. The blankets and sheets were no better. Thin linens; ugly brown woven blanket. No fluffy duvet nestled between two layers of crips sheets in this room. Honestly, I suffered with a lower backache for two months after those sleeps. Other than that, the room was adequate. We were on the fourth floor looking out at the NYNY rollercoaster. Screams and wheel grinding got going on the early side (it's a wonder why anyone would ride a rollercoaster at that hour). Oh yes, we also heard that beeping sound from garbage or construction trucks. Thank goodness for earplugs.I don't gamble, but the casino seemed decent enough. Food: Fast food choices fine for breakfast. Discovered hot oatmeal with a variety of fixings at Starbucks - yummy. Eggs were rather greasy at the breakfast stop. We had coupons for the buffet, so decided on breakfast one morning. Good selection. No complaints. Ate at one of the restaurants one night. Sorry, I've forgotten the name, but it's the casual diner type one. Overall, food was very fair and we definitely wouldn't go back. What really made us squirm was witnessing a crew (including some kind of security person or manager) totally disinfecting the table behind us, all in blue rubber gloves. They even threw out all cutlery and dishes on the table. We didn't go to the trouble of asking why all this was going on for fear of the answer. A plus for us was the location. We liked the fact that the hotel wasn't dead set in the middle of all the strip action, but rather closer to the south end where the scene wasn't so hectic. Also, made getting out of Vegas much easier, both navigation and timewise.Bottom line - would I stay at the MC again? Probably not unless we were guaranteed brand new pillow top beds and top quality duvets and linens. Did I mention that the bottom sheets weren't fitted causing them to slide off at somepoint during the night. It was totally gross waking up on the matress cover. What can I say? The Venezia spoiled us silly!"
193,402,"Jun 29 2009 	Enjoyed the hotel pool was disappointing	We stayed for 2 nites and were happy overall with the hotel. I really liked the layout - you did not have to walk for miles through the casino to get to your room. The elevators were right off the lobby as well as the 'fast food' type restaurants. The beds were very comfortable - which is a plus after long days walking the strip. We booked a special summer package which included several 2 for 1 coupons. When we got to the room, we realized they 'forgot' the coupons - however the front desk corrected the mistake later.The biggest disappointment was the pool area. We were only able to go to the pool one late afternoon. We found 4 chairs together (a plus), but I thought the pool water was very dirty. It was cloudy and had pieces of paper floating in it - probably because of all the people drinking and smoking IN the pool. The wave pool was not working this day, but the water here was much cleaner and no one was in the pool. Of course I expected the loud music but it was definitely LOUD - forget relaxing by the pool when the music was on. I might stay here again based on location of the hotel - and only in the colder weather - not when we wanted pool time."
194,402,"Jun 29 2009 	JUST SAY ""NO""	The only thing good about the hotel was the fact that it does not smell like smoke like other hotels. The room was outdated, the tub was not working, we had to stop in the middle of the shower to let the water go down so we can continue and it would not overflow, we called and they never showed up to fix it, and when we told them at checkout they said there was no mention of it at all, and we had to ask for a new hair dryer, since ours was throwing sparks out and we got one that was nasty dirty and it did the same thing the next day, and finally we called them again and they brought us a new one at 4:30am, when we asked for it at 2:30am....."
195,402,"Jun 28 2009 	Great view of the strip	The room was spacious, the beds were squeaky &amp; my back hurt for days after staying here. The chairs had stains, I hate that, I will not sit on anything that looks like that. The pool was nice, the food in the bar area was good. The buffet, for the price, was YUCK! We had a great view from our room. Find someplace else to stay."
196,402,"Jun 26 2009	Skip the Monte Carlo!	The best thing about our recent stay at the Monte Carlo Hotel &amp; Casino was that it was only 1 night. The room itself and the buffet were adequate but nothing special. The first problem was check-in, when the agent handling our check-in answered a phone call and kept us waiting close to 10 minutes while he handled a complaint from another guest wanting to change his room. When we got to our room, a quick check out the window revealed the ugliest view we've ever had - nothing but construction everywhere. However, we hadn't come for the view and figured that the construction wouldn't be a problem at night. Wrong! All night long, equipment delivered supplies, with crashing metal and equipment backup beeping dominating the night noise. We then understood why the guest had been trying to change his room when we checked in. The next problem was heading for breakfast. We heard the 1st emergency alarm while boarding the elevator. Alarms kept going off peridically for over half an hour and it wasn't until the 4th or 5th alarm that they bothered to announce that the alarms were only a test. Three days later we again passed through Las Vegas and spent 2 nights at Treasure Island in a great room for about the same price (around $75 night). What a difference!"
197,402,Jun 26 2009 	Definitely a keeper	The Monte Carlo is definitely on my list of favorites for Las Vegas. We arrived early (noon) and were able to check in right away. Check in was quick and easy. Our room (16th floor) was spacious and clean. Beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was all marble and very clean. The shower was great. We were not bothered by the construction at all. We did not use the pool but did walk out there and I agree that the music is very loud (as it is everywhere in Vegas) and it was very crowded. The food at the Cafe was excellent and reasonably priced by Vegas standards. The casino was large but easy to navigate. Don't plan on winning in Vegas right now. Things are wound up tighter than a drum. Do your gambling downtown at the Four Queens and be sure to stay for the laser light show.
198,402,"Jun 26 2009 	Twelve Years staying at the Monte Carlo - Never Again!	We arrived at the Monte after an 11-hour flight only to be told that our room wouldn't be ready till 5 pm. When we got there our expected Strip View was entirely blocked by a towering huge grey wall which turned out to be part of the new City Centre project. The beds were Ok but why don't they supply decent plump pillows instead of the dolls house variety? My wife and I have been staying at (and recommending) the Monte Carlo since it opened in 1996 and have seen a steady decline in just about every aspect of the Hotel. On our last visit 18 months ago we saw the start of the City Centre construction right next to the hotel -and the noise and dust that accompanied it. The once-fabulous pool area has been greatly reduced (the Lazy River wasn't working the day we arrived) and the whole environment is overshadowed by what appears to be the Backside of Benidorm. - and a huge grey warehouse-style abomination that completely ruins the view. Even the cooling waterfalls have gone. On arrival at the pool at 9am everyone had their bags searched (no, not for bombs) but - &quot;due to a change of policy we don't allow any food in the pool area&quot; we were told by an officious Border Guard and my wife had her bag of crisps promptly confiscated - as did a kid behind with a half-eaten bag of popcorn. When I asked why people were being allowed in with their coffee I was told: &quot;Coffee is OK but no food.&quot; &quot;So not even a Danish bought in the Hotel to accompany my Starubucks?&quot; I queried - only to be told that pastries were on the forbidden list! Safely past the sentries I went for some towels: &quot;Only two per guest&quot;! the girl barked when I took four. &quot;But I need 2 for my wife as well&quot; I protested and was sulkily supplied with another pair. But before we had time to settle on our longers the most ear-splitting noise (it could not be described as music) blasted our eardrums. Don't get me wrong I like music (Will Smith's my hero) but this was not the usual Monte soft rock -it was Gangsta Rap at full blast and went on mercilessly all morning. People were complaining all around the pool and one couple went into Reception to lodge their objections, then more people joined the queue. All to no avail. On the second morning (after our food search) &quot;Yo Momma! Yo momma!&quot; was belting out again -it was relentless - and more people complained but we were told that &quot;The music is streamed down from a satellite so we can't change it.&quot; (Yes you heard that correctly). I don't know if the Manager is a friend of Snoop Doggy Dog but despite the daily protests of his paying guests he refused to either play something which might be appreciated by the majority of his paying guests - or lower the volume. When I complained at Reception I was advised &quot;When you get home fill in a form on the Website.&quot; Brilliant. Instead I wrote a very a strong letter on Monte notepaper and handed it in - as we checked out in disgust! What contempt for their guests - no wonder the place is in terminal decline. Even Lance Burton went AWOL - his Theatre closed until further notice -he was apparently 'off sick' (why am I not surprised). Shopping in The Street of Dreams consisted of one lonely shop (the others were closed) and the hotel Hypermarket had disappeared to make space for the new Mexican-themed Diablo Cantina which was lively, fun, busy and totally out of character with the Hotel's 'classy' French Rivera theme. When we ventured outside the Hotel we constantly had pimps thrusting 'girls for hire' cards at us. I later counted thirteen (yes thirteen) pimps in a line so that holidaymakers had to run a gamut of sleaze before escaping to yet another line of pushers a few yards up the Strip. I cannot stress enough our disgust with the management of the Monte Carlo (and I repeat we've been regular guests for nearly thirteen years) and we certainly will neither be returning, nor recommending this pit to any more friends. We checked out and went to the Treasure Island Hotel after spotting a great offer on the Expedia website (one free night in five). See report on Treasure Island which we would highly recommend to those who don't want to spend their vacation with bleeding eardrums and pastry-less coffee."
199,402,"Jun 25 2009 	good value for money	Based on some of the reviews of this hotel, I was not looking forward to my say here but the building work round the pool was finished and it is a nice pleasent hotel. Room a bit disapointing and smelled of smoke and bath did not drain very well. If you want to laze by the pool get there early. I was vey shocked at how many people go to the pool at 9 am then leave their towels until much later in the day. This made getting a space very difficult and reminded me of Spain (also not a good place to be with a hangver as very load music played from opening to closing). Found staff to be helpful and friendly. The Brand steak house was amazing, if a bit pricey. Diablos was great, drinks, cocktails and food with brillant open view of strip. For the amount of money we paid for this trip it was great and whilst I would prefer to stay at another hotel on my next visit, I would not rule out staying here again."
200,402,"Jun 24 2009 	bathroom with no stopper	Upon our arrival on June 15 at 8:30 am, my daughter and I checked to see if rooms were available. We were told to check back and at about 2 pm, we did. My daughter had a room, but I didn't. Checking further the clerk found a room on another floor. When I arrived in the room, I immediately went to the bathroom to start my bath and discovered there was no stopper to hold the water in. I called from 2:10 to 3 pm, and finally I went down to talk to someone personally. I was told by a person at the front desk where Angela was the supervisor that none of the tubs have stoppers. At the moment she said that, my daughter stepped up and she had one in hers. I felt that it was a insult for her to say that no tubs had stoppers. I suggested that I could go to CVS and buy one and they could reimburse me. When I travel, baths are very important to me, and after arriving so early, I was ready to relax. Also, the stopper they put in allowed the water to seep out, so whenever I took a bath, the water would not stay at the level.I was in room 13-325, so if you're given that room, refuse it."
201,402,Jun 22 2009 	Completely average and don't expect to grab a spot by the pool	I found this hotel and this destination overrated and found it all average at best. The big drawback to me was the pool area of this hotel. You cannot possible relax when you are situation by the tram passing overhead which is where you will be unless you get to the pool early in the morning. The hotel in general was overcrowded. Liked the brewery though.
202,402,"Jun 18 2009 	A great Vegas experience	I have stayed here before during the early construction of City Center and now that the pounding is done, this is a great place again.It is nice with children that you can check in, go to your room and all of that without stepping into the casino. Not many places there can boast that, but it is appreciated.The hotel is a higher end casino and the rooms are appropriate. They are a standard room, in this case with two beds, but have are nicely decorated and appointed.The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also adequate. For the price I paid it was truly an exceptional deal. The wave pool and lazy river kept the kids busy while I was able to get some work done. We did not eat at the hotel, so cannot comment on the food, but it was a place I would not hesitate to stay in again.The only negative is the parking. With the main parking garage being taken with construction workers, it was challenging finding adequate parking."
203,402,"Jun 18 2009 	False Advertising	The Monte Carlo is offering a Summer Vegas promotion that includes 2 for 1 Lance Burton tickets. The problem - the show has been canceled through July 7th, yet they are still selling the promotion for the cancelled dates and not offering any type of compensation to those already booked on the promotion. I think ,at the very least, a rain check on the two for one tickets should be offered. A reservations clerk tells me not and points out that we also have the option of 2 for 1 Zumanity tickets. We don't want Zumanity tickets and would not have booked the promotion if not for Lance Burton. I am very disappointed with the hotel's lack of customer service ethic."
204,402,"Jun 17 2009 	Good value for the money but some shortcomings	The location is pretty good, but the pool was noisy and crowded, the casino was smoky, and the windows really filthy. The guy at the front desk told me that there were problems with the window washing equipment since last year's fire. Guess they thought no one would care about the thick layer of dirt caked on the windows.Very expensive poolside drinks too."
205,402,"Jun 17 2009 	Pleasantly Surprised	Since we visit Vegas once a year we have visited several hotels in the area. This was the first for Monte Carlo. It is centrally located. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Very clean and very well ventilated. I am not a smoker and sometimes the older casinos reek of old cigarette smoke. The Monte Carlo smelled very fresh. We stayed on an entirely non-smoking floor, very nice. Pools were great, very crowded on the weekend though so get a spot early. Great nachos at the pool pub. Pools for adults and kids. The spa was one of the nicer spas in the area. Smaller but still had all of the amenities I love. The hotel was spacious but not overly large like some hotels &amp; casinos, where it takes you half an hour just to get to your room after walking in the front door. The only thing I would have changed was to get a room strip side as opposed to pool side, music starts at 9am and due to some late nights I wasn't quite ready to get up that early. Otherwise the room was nice and quiet, I didn't hear the neighbors as I have in other hotels (Bally's, Luxor, etc). I would defintely recommend and stay again. Some colleagues even checked out of their hotel and checked into the Monte Carlo since theirs was sooo bad."
206,402,"Jun 17 2009 	Loved it!	We only stayed one night but we intend returning and staying longer. The room was spacious, very clean and everything worked. The check in was quick and easy and the staff very helpful. We did the 2 for 1 Martini's and let the bartender whip up his own favorites. The Hotel is well placed in the Strip with lots of great places to visit closeby. Parking is a problem as there are only a limited number of spaces, in the end we twigged that Valet was the answer as it's free apart from the gratuities."
207,402,"Jun 15 2009 	Stolen by housekeeping	I spent a week in Monte Carlo Hotel. When I went to the airport I forgot a bag in my room. I came back 40 minutes later and the housekping went inside my room, took away my value things and left the bag only with some magazines. The room was already dirty, she went there just to look for &quot;forgetable things&quot; and she found. The security found my nike sunglass in her car, but not the rest of things. The Monte Carlo is not a safety ple to stay!!"
208,402,Jun 15 2009 	Excellent Conference Facilities	I have attended a business conference at the Monte Carlo for the past four years. My wife comes along and we always stay at the hotel. She and I were both pleased with the Monaco Suite and the service we received as hotel guests. Equally impressive was the conference facilities and business center. All my business needs were met while attending the three day conference. The hotel was well prepared and nothing was overlooked for the convenience of the conference attendees. The Monte Carlo facilities continue to be the most impressive I have ever encountered.
209,402,Jun 14 2009 	Loud rock music everywhere 	We were awakened at 6 AM with construction noise. I realized that City Center was being built next door and asked for a higher floor room - we got the 29th Floor - great? No! They are renovating the 30th floor - lots of hammering. Ask for 23rd or 24th Floor to be away from most of the noise - we moved to 24th Fl. The casino played very loud hard rock music. We couldn't stay at the pool - the music was unbearable. We're both in our early 60's.We got great show tickets next door by MGM Grand &quot;Tix 4 tonight&quot;. The Jersey Boys was fabulous and we also enjoyed Louie Anderson. We drove to Mt. Charleston for breakfast at Mt. Charlestown Resort - beautiful ski area only 30 min from Las Vegas. We mistakingly ate at Andres at Mote Carlo Hotel. $45-$63 entrees. Dinner cost over $200 for both of us and the food was just okay. Had a great five days in Vegas but would not stay again at Monte Carlo because of the loud music. Also unexpected $20/per day charge for use of their Fitness Ctr.
210,402,"Jun 14 2009 	Another Great Stay	Each year in June my husband attends a conference at the Monte Carlo. I come along to relax and have some quiet time and we stay at the hotel because it is convenient. We usually get a King room on a high floor and ask for the side away from the City Center construction. This year we decided to get a Monaco suite and really stretch out. We were on the pool side, which is also on the construction side, but the only noise we heard was the blasting music that shook our windows coming from the pool during the day. At night, we didnt hear any sound from the construction and not a sound was heard during the early morning hours. We booked well in advance so the price was very reasonable.I love staying at the Monte Carlo because the hotel and casino are quiet and not crowded during the week. That also keeps the smoke at a minimum so Its easy to escape to fresh air and still play the machines or find a table where no one is smoking. We stay Wednesday through Saturday morning and the service is excellent, our room is cleaned whenever we ask so as not to disturb us and there are several choices for dining right inside the hotel. It is within walking distance to the other hotels and we usually walk to the Bellagio to watch the water show and stop in the other casinos on the way back.It still amazes me that people bring their kids because the card snappers still try to shove porno cards in your hand as you walk along the streets during the evening and most of the shows are for adults, but the Monte Carlo seems to be the mildest with few exposed body parts displayed around the hotel. Their pool is one of the best with a wave area, reversing current area and a floating river area that seems to be very popular with families. There are other hotels that are less expensive and some with a lot more glitz but the Monte Carlo will stay our number one choice as long as the conference continues to be held in Las Vegas."
211,402,"Jun 14 2009 	Good location would stay again	My husband and I just came back from our 5 night stay at the Monte Carlo (6/5-6/10/09). We almost didn't book this hotel because I was a bit concerned after reading some of the reviews about the noise level from the construction going on next door and the loud music at the pool. We were on the 12th floor, south side, and we had a view of the strip and although we could see the construction we couldn't hear it at all. As far as the pool was concerned, it was loud (on a Monday afternoon no less) but we didn't spend much time there. It was great being so close to ny, ny &amp; mgm and having the cvs next door for essentials. One of the big complaints that we had was the buffet- the food was good but we found that it really wasn't hot even after they had just put it out. We ended up eating food from the pasta station for dinner and omelette station for breakfast to get hot food. The room was a standard room with a king bed and the sheets and bedding was all clean although a bit ratty and really needs replacement soon. Also, please be aware that 2 of the restaurants in the hotel are closed for renovation right now and Lance Burton is not doing shows &quot;until further notice&quot; so we ended up leaving the hotel for our food/entertainment. Fortunately, we got a great deal on the hotel but I wouldn't spend more and may stay somewhere else next time for the same price."
212,402,"Jun 11 2009 	Wonderful Experience 	My husband and I booked five days in a spa suite at the Monte Carlo in May of 2009 for my 30th birthday. The lobby was breathtaking and smelled of roses, and check in was very quick! Our suite was on the 28th, floor, and was beyond anything we had imagined! The floor was quiet, and the room far exceeded our expectations! The bed was VERY comfortable, the spa tube was HUGE, the bathroom was very nice, and the room itself was VERY large. The suite was also very clean, and we had a nightly turn-down service that left chocolates on the bed. We had a FANTASTIC stay in this room, and, as far as we're concerned, the value just cannot be beaten! The hotel has a good location...right across the street from the NYNY (which is our favorite casino) and the MGM grand. I would stay in this hotel again in a HEARTBEAT...and have already recommended it to all of our friends!"
213,402,Jun 11 2009 	Rooms are great	I stayed in Monte Carlo for 2 nights.The room was wonderful and confortable.Best part is that the casino is in the same hotel so we dont have go out of the hotel for gambing.Only problem was that there were hardly any options in food for vegetarians.I would recommend anyone visiting Las Vegas to stay at Monte Carlo.
214,402,"Jun 8 2009 	Nice hotel and casino	Stayed 3 nights, hotel is in a great location across from mgm grand, good service and friendly casino and poker room. Only drawback is the construction next door that has almost wiped-out the pool area. My room was high enough that I was not bothered by the construction but the person I was traveling with was in a lower floor and was awaken early every morning buy the noise."
215,402,"Jun 8 2009 	I dug it	Monte Carlo is located on the Las Vegas Strip, just within walking distance to where all the action is. Regular double hotel room is relatively solid, if unassuming and fits the mold of a very traditional hotel. Clean, moderate space is good for travel and Monte Carlo really is the place to just sleep and do nothing more since you're in Vegas. Hotel offers friendly valet parking and the lobby itself is a gorgeous sight to see. Our room view was kind of ugly, given that there was a lot of construction occurring at the time and we were in the back of the hotel. Casino functions like a lot of other casinos would with all your available gambling and restaurants. Place is conveniently located next to a 24 hr. CVS so you can get all your needed foods or toiletries but also on the Strip so you're not far from the action."
216,402,"Jun 7 2009 	We'll be back...	We just spent 3 comped nights at Monte Carlo. We tend to stay at whichever hotel offers us the most and this time it was Treasure Island (2 free nights) and Monte Carlo. We've always enjoyed eating at the MC buffet and gambling in their casino, so wanted to try their rooms.Initially, after spending 2 nights at TI, the room at MC was a little bit of a letdown. TI has fluffy beds and a flat screen TV. The room at MC felt like I was staying in my grandma's guest room - a little dated and overly ornate. However, after spending some time in there, I also realized that the room was very clean, the bathroom very nice and it really was just a matter of a difference in taste.A plus with this casino is that the elevators are speedy (elevators are segregated by floors, so our bank of 6 elevators only serviced floors 23-32). Another plus is the food court for a quick snack. And the Starbucks is the most efficiently run Starbucks I've ever been to! The line might look intimidating, but the speed at which they get you through is amazing!I had asked for a room with a view and the front desk person accommodated - but I realized that due to City Center and the configuration of the hotel, that there really ISN'T a room with a view anymore. We had a room that faced the strip - but was angled so that mostly we saw the roof of one of the City Center buildings, complete with Porta Potties for the workers. However, we don't go to Vegas to look out our room window, so it wasn't an issue.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at MC. Their buffet is always one of our favorites because the food is good and the seating is comfortable and cozy. And we brought home some of the money we took, so the casino was friendly to us!"
217,402,"Jun 6 2009 	Overall an average hotel.	We stayed at the Monte Carlo recently because of a free room offer. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was pretty nice for an older casino on the strip. We had a spa suite and. although everything was a bit old and dated, it was clean with a nice whirlpool tub. The hotel pool was very nice, better than the larger casinos that we usually visit. We had a cabana, which was luxurious and relaxing. The spa was nothing special, however, so I went to Mandalay Bay for my usual spa day. I wasn't overly impressed with the restaurant staff, they were not attentive at all. The hotel staff was great, on the other hand. My only real complaint was that it was extremely noisy early in the morning due to construction on some new condos next door."
218,402,Jun 5 2009	Monte Carlo Hotel	The Monte Carlo is a good hotel value. The adjoining property construction was not a problem if you are staying on the southern end of the property. All the staff were helpful and courteous.
219,402,"Jun 5 2009 	Almost Less Than Average Hotel	A friend and I stayed at the Monte Carlo for four nights. I had read the reviews and they all seemed to have given the hotel an average review. I rate it average also, I suppose. The one thing that bothered me the most about this hotel was our room. It looked as if it hadn't been updated since it'd been built. It was not clean. There was hair all over the carpet. I don't think it had been vacuumed for a long time. The towels pilled pretty badly. I had to pick the individual pills off after I dried myself. The bed linens were in pretty bad shape. My blanket had cigarette burns on it. I hate to think what else was on the sheets. Yuck! The mattress was the worst I have ever slept on. My back was killing me the whole time I was there. I've slept in sleeping bags on a cot that were more comfortable.I had read the reviews about the pool area...about the loud music. It was very annoying. I could not understand the reasoning behind it. There were no college kids bumping and grinding to the music. Especially since the pool closed in the early evening. I had to turn my iPod on high to drown out the annoying pop/hip hop crap. However, the pool itself was nice. I really enjoyed the lazy river pool. There wasn't an excess amount of chlorine in the pools so my skin and eyes did not suffer.We tried the morning buffet. The food was average but it was the process of getting the table that was a pain. We were the only two people waiting to be seated at the time but it was this huge ordeal. The hostesses had walkie talkies, we could see the food/kitchen just a short ways down a hall but we could only walk a few paces where we were stopped then ushered a few paces further, then stopped and finally shown to our seats. We were the only ones in line! It was ridiculous! On other thing is the coffee. I don't think I've been to a place that doesn't have actual half and half cream for coffee. They had this imitation stuff. When I asked for the real thing they gave me a glass of milk. Weird! We found a nice place across the street with better food and prices and avoided the buffet after that experience.I know it seems like I'm giving the Monte Carlo a bad rap but it was only a place to lay our heads. I'm not a gambler so I don't know how the gambling is there. But the employees were very helpful. The lobby is very beautiful. I think they spent most of the maintenance money on the outward appearance of the hotel and the lobby, completely ignoring the rooms. The location is great. Right on the strip so we were able to walk to other hotels and sites. There is a bus also that goes up and down the strip that stops almost in front of the hotel. Would I go to the Monte Carlo again? Nope."
220,402,"Jun 2 2009 	Comfortable and pleasant stay	We ended up here by mistake but boy we really enjoyed our stay, clean rooms and friendly staff. The buffet is not 24 hours so we tried a restaurant right beside the buffet area and I have one word... AWESOME !! the staff is mostly spanish speaking, they are so funny and friendly ! we had a blast there, the food was awesome and the casino was very clean. Believe it or not I felt that the slot machines were looser than some other csinos I went to, but you know, luck is luck =)The pool was a hot spot, hot girls and cool guys, but seriously it was beautiful there, we spent almost 2 hours in the morning.I would love to stay again !"
221,402,"Jun 2 2009 	Your possessions will not be returned	May 2009. If you decide to stay at Monte Carlo please, please, please make sure you do not leave anything in your room. I am 53 years old; I work for the court system and I value myself as an honest person. I have no intention of ripping-off this establishment for a measly $100.00 worth of possessions. I contacted the Monte Carlo the day after I checked out to request the return of a bathing suit (hanging on a towel rack in the bathroom) and sweatshirt (hanging in the closet). After several days of leaving messages and speaking with their Security Department, I received a letter from Denise Chilipka-Oltay, Claim Rep for Monte Carlo who stated the Monte Carlo is not responsible for reported missing items, are unable to compensate the loss, and hope this incident will not deter my visiting Monte Carlo again. I again say pleaseif this hotel does not hire honest maids, how safe is your property in your room? I will NEVER stay there again and I will tell EVERYONE else the same thing."
222,402,Jun 2 2009 	Good Hotel	A good hotel centrally located on the strip. All the facilities you would want in a good location withing walking distance of most other hotels and shows .
223,402,Jun 2 2009	Amazing Experience	It was our first trip to the USA. We were spellbound with our experience. Las Vegas was great. Monte Carlo is a huge resort with a great casino. The rooms were very clean and hygienic. The casino was huge. We were given a lot of freebies on check in.Overall a great experience
224,402,"Jun 1 2009 	Nice place to stay and good price	I just stayed at the Monte Carlo with 3 girlfriends for a long weekend in Las Vegas. It was a really nice hotel. The staff was great. The Cafe restaurant is open 24 hours a day and the food was good(slightly overpriced as is everything in Las Vegas). The buffet was really good and it was relatively cheap. The Brew Pub also served the best buffalo wings. The casino wasn't overcrowed and the shopps were good. The pool while crowded was really clean and nice.The worst part was that our floor had several young drunk boys and loud girls, so I would probably move to a hotel that would be more out of their reach monetarily! Like the Bellagio or the Venetian. I think they had 6 to 8 people in each of their rooms. It was loud. ( I never called security because they were awful just annoying).I also had a spa treatment (Swedish Massage by Jose) and it was awesome. He was really great. Overall the hotel is clean, the staff is friendly and the surroundings were very good and I would return again."
225,402,"Jun 1 2009 	A hotel in Vegas that meets the sweet spot	I've stayed at both some of the lower priced hotels in and around Vegas and also some of the extravagant higher priced hotels, and the Monte Carlo falls right in the middle in terms of both price and comfort. Its perhaps the best of the middle tier hotels that arguably include: Treasure Island, Hotel Paris, MGM Grand and New York NY. For the past 7 years I've come here to attend March Madness festivities the rooms have been very clean, the beds very comfortable, and the hospitality staff is at your beck and call all through out the day (and night). I do agree with MJP2617 who complained about the pillows, but I usually remedy this by ordering more of them and I make it work. The pool is also very nice. They have a wave pool and a river type pool which wraps around a huge area for laying out and tanning. They have a great sports type bar on the ground floor located right next to the pool called the Monte Carlo Brew Pub. This pub features a huge television and several smaller ones spaced evenly through out the bar. This is a great place to hang out during NCAA March Madness as fans from almost every team in the tournament can be found rooting for their alma maters. Its a really fun atmosphere and the food is great. They also have the Brand Steakhouse which features a bar area plus couches placed right behind nice lcd tv's. Its almost like watching your favorite sporting event at home, but while eating a steak that you'd be hard pressed to match yourself. At night they have the Diablo Bar which we usually use as a pre-party destination but could easily be utilized as your main destination if you don't want to move around. For the money I'd highly recommend staying at the Monte Carlo if you don't want to spend the money at an upper tier hotel but don't want to take the chance of staying at a dump either."
226,402,"May 29 2009 	Monte Carlo is a great hotel for your money!	We loved our stay at Monte Carlo. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, the buffet was surprisingly good. The only negative thing was we ended up with the suite next to the elevator, but didnt make too much noise. Bring your own pillows, the pillows the hotel provide were very uncomfortable for us. Hopefully whatever other hotel we stay next time in las vegas is as great as monte carlo was."
227,402,"May 28 2009	Nice Hotel Great Value	My mother and I stayed at the Monte Carlo over Memorial Day weekend and had a great time! They allowed us to check in early (around 11am) and even gave us a strip view room because it was my mother's 60th birthday. The room was quite nice and clean. I wouldn't rate the room above average (maybe on par w/ a Hilton Garden Inn), but it was fine. The location of the hotel was perfect. Situated in between the Bellagio and the New York, New York and across from the MGM- it's perfect. As has been mentioned before, there is a whole bunch of construction going on, but it didn't bother us much at all. The pool area was very crowded (could be beacause it was Memorial Day Weekend) and the chairs are REALLY close together (ie: touching), but the lazy river and wave pool were awesome. I read in an earlier review to bring your own inner tube for the lazy river, so I did, and instead of each spending $12/day or whatever to rent them, I spent $3.99 each @ KMart before I left and just tossed them when we were done. Totally the way to go! We ate at the Cafe (great service, decent food), the buffet (decent) and the Brew Pub (Great service, great food). In short, a great value!"
228,402,"May 27 2009 	On the strip without the pompous attitude.	We were looking for a quick getaway over the memorial day weekend, and took a chance on the monte carlo. Very excited we did, a relaxing place. Clean rooms ( Allowed to check in at 9am), casino floor was easy 2 navigate, earned 3 free buffets which were above average. lIked the pool atmosphere( no drinking water, was a little loud but didnt ruin it 4 me.) Overall the best value we have found on the strip, Classy but not over the top."
229,402,"May 27 2009 	Best deal in town for the money	We recently stayed at the Monte Carlo while we were in Vegas for my son's college graduation. We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and it was $55 for Tuesday, $49 for Wednesday and $55 for Thursday. In additon, we received a &quot;summer party&quot; pack of coupons that were good for 2 for 1 at the buffet, spa, New York roller caoster, plus several other discounts. Great spa with wonderful equipment. While we were standing in line to check in ( at 10:30am) several groups jumped ahead of us to the open window and the manager came over to apologize and gave us a $50 comp meal in the cafe. The lower floor room that we had booked was not available at that time and so we were also upgraded to a higher floor room that was ready. Great customer service!! The meal was very good. The rooms were clean although a bit worn (peeling wall paper and a stain on the ceiling). We had stayed the previous 2 nights in a fountain view room at the Bellagio so it was hard to compare the quality of the room. Pool was very crowded but still very nice. Overall, this was a great deal--nice hotel and great location!"
230,402,"May 25 2009 	Ear-splitting mind-numbing hard rock ""music"" all day at the pool	Although this hotel was top-notch in terms of cleanliness, service, etc., our experience was totally ruined by the horrible , high-volume, head-banging music at the pool all day. There was no corner without speakers, and even though we wore earplugs, the volume was so nerve-wracking that we wound up with headaches after a short time. Repeated requests to lower the volume were ignored or explained away (&quot;Las Vegas is returning to its sin-city reputation&quot;). Part of the reason we came to Las Vegas was to experience wramth by a swimming pool, but we wound up in our room to escape the &quot;music.&quot; Other patrons requested that the volume be reduced as well and, like us, were ignored. If you're looking for relaxation, avoid the Monte Carlo!"
231,402,"May 24 2009 	We stay there every year great location but pool is overcrowded	We have been staying at Monte Carlo for the last 5-6 years, primarily for its price and location. It's usually one of the least expensive choices when we buy in a package deal (airfare from NYC + hotel). We like the location because there is a drugstore (I think CVS or Walgreens) right next door. We don't rent a car so it's very convenient for us to get snacks or bottled waters at the drugstore. At the hotel, they usually double or triple the price so it does save us money overall. You can walk to other hotels or take the bus. The hotel rooms are standard size and pretty nice and clean. The AC can be easily controlled. The bathroom is standard Vegas style - nice, clean, modern. There is cleaning service everyday like all other Vegas hotels. Most of the time we stayed there, the staff was accommodating and very nice. For instance, our power went out due to construction going on in the section of the hotel we were staying at for a few hours. My husband's medication (which has to be refrigerated) was affected. The staff was really nice and comped us. However, there have been a couple incidences where the staff was not accommodating and gave us grief but after talking to the managers, everything was smoothed out.The casino is pretty standard - slots and tables, as well as sports center where you can bet and watch your teams! Our fave game is blackjack and we have experienced good luck overall at this hotel. Another big plus is that they have one of the best fitness centers/gym in Vegas. Yes, we are &quot;those&quot; people who actually work out during our vacation!!! If you are too, this is your place! There is a charge - but I think you can get a 3-day deal for about $45. It's big and they have everything from cardio equipment to weight machines to free weights (heavy weights). One year, we were staying there during a Vegas event for body builders. We met a few contestants in the Monte Carlo gym. The only reason they were staying there was because Monte Carlo gym is known to have the best gym equipment. There are a few restaurants at this hotel but I don't think any of them are too memorable. They were overall pretty average (not horrible at all, just nothing special). Their buffet is standard and very average. I prefer the buffet at the Bellagio or Rio's Seafood Buffet. They do have a Starbucks at least! My husband and I usually love relaxing by the pool or going swimming... their pool area is very sunny...however, the Monte Carlo pool is overcrowded. They have three pools but they are all super crowded. The river pool is very shallow and not wide enough. If there are slow people in front of you, it's hard to pass them. You can sit in the other pools but you can't really go swimming because there are too many people. Every year, it seemed like it was getting more and more crowded. (However, I'm not sure if it'll still be crowded this year in 2009 since the economy is down). To summarize, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Great location, next to drugstore- Starbucks- Best gym on the strip- Hotel rooms are nice and clean- Staff is usually accommodatingCons:- Pool is overcrowded- Nothing special about the restaurants"
232,402,"May 23 2009 	Clean hotel good location loud pool	The pool area is nice with just enough shade, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the music is SO loud! It would be great is they saved that party atmosphere for the Fri/Sat/Sun crowd. Great casino floor, great location and GREAT smell when you walk int the door!"
233,402,"May 22 2009 	Monte Carlo proved really good value	My boyfriend and I had been to Vegas less than 9 months before our recent visit and we didn't remember even seeing the Monte Carlo - despite the fact we previously stayed in the MGM Grand practically opposite! We went back to Vegas for a wedding and, because we'd been before, we knew most of the hotels on the Strip are much of a muchness. We ended up picking the Monte Carlo because we found a great offer whereby we got about 20% off the room for booking a few months in advance. We spent about 200 in total for 5 nights and, once in the rooms, they were very similar to the MGM, not surprising as it's owned by the same group. As such, if the same deal ever came up again I'd jump at it. The casino is pretty big, and usually quite quiet, the buffet was good and the room was clean, spacious and comfortable.The only issue is that there's building works very close to the building (true of lots of hotels on the Strip at the moment). After the first night we requested to change rooms which was done within 5 minutes, no hassles and really, really pleasant staff. It's not the most obvious choice on the Strip but the Monte Carlo really did deliver for us, and at such a competitive rate I would go back again"
234,402,"May 21 2009 	Nice hotel pool has very very noisy music	The hotel was good enough &amp; the food was great value as we were given 2 for 1 buffet meal tickets, the pool area was nice BUT VERY VERY NOISY RAP MUSIC which was not there when we stayed 2 years ago &amp; it plays from 9 to 6.I complained at reception they don't like it either as they can hear it to &amp; they said the management are catering for the younger generation at the pool---great pity as w will not stay there again because of this."
235,402,"May 21 2009 	Decent clean accomodations but could use some updating	Check-in: Pleasantly greeted by Adrian and told our room would be ready in 45 minutes. It was only 10:00 a.m. when we checked in, which was great. We also were given a room away from the City Center construction, at our request. Room: Clean and average. Could use some updating, e.g, new bed spreads, furniture looked a little worn, but all-in-all, it was fine for our brief stay, and the price ($100 per night.) Food: Ate twice in the Cafe. Food was good but service was S-L-O-W. Ate at the buffet once and it was tasty -- lots of options. Upon check-in we got a $25 coupon off dinner at Andre's - the French restaurant onsite -- but we never used it. We enjoyed Happy Hour (3pm-6pm) and snacks at El Diablo. Fun, happening place that opens right on the strip.Casino: We're not big gamblers, but did play a few tables and slots. Never very crowded. Liked that they had $5 tables. Pool: Fair. Much of the area is overshadowed by the construction of City Center which butts up against the north end of the pool area near the wave pool. It even caused part of the lazy river to be closed. The music was WAY TOO LOUD. Also, I would have preferred a designated smoking area as there were people all about smoking which became bothersome. Much of the south area of the pool is shaded until at least noon, so at 9:00 a.m. people rush to the sunshine areas. Location: Next to NY, NY and across from the MGM, so there is plenty to see and do. I like that the main entrance is not facing the strip, and it was never crazy-crowded. I had no problem getting a taxi. Overall, this property definitely could use a spruce-up as it looks a little dated. But for a short stay, it was acceptable. When I'm in Vegas, I spend most of my time out of the room anyway, so it met my needs just fine."
236,402,"May 21 2009 	LOUD OBNOXIOUS DJ MUSIC 6 HOURS A DAY - TAKE YOUR EARPLUGS!!	This hotel is clean and classy on the inside but the pool area is another story. Once you step outside to the pool your ears are assaulted with the loud, pounding, beat of DJ music reverberating off the cement surfaces in every direction. There is no way to escape the noise and just relax by the pool. If you are between the ages of 16 (I swear many of the partiers were this age) and 29 and are looking for a drunk, pickup party....this is the place for you. If you are anybody else - forget it! There is no quiet area and the so-called music (which starts at noon) doesn't stop until the pool closes at 6:00 on the dot every day. We were told that the DJ is only there on Friday and Saturday which is a lie because we arrived on Thursday and the party was going strong!!It is too bad that this lovely hotel has decided to go this route. Yes, Vegas is Sin City, and yes, people go here to have a good time but not everyone is looking for Animal House. Many other hotels have &quot;adult&quot; pools separate from the regular pool so guests have a choice of where they want to be. At the Monte Carlo, there is no choice! The staff could have cared less about our complaints athough they did admit that lots of guests had complained about the noise. Hmmm, makes you wonder what the Monte Carlo marketing team is thinking. I will never return to this hotel and would tell anyone thinking of going to Vegas to avoid it. Definitely don't take kids anywhere near this place!!"
237,402,"May 20 2009 	Not memorable	I've stayed at 18 hotels in Las Vegas, and this one did not stand out in my mind at all.The room was just okay, the pool looked like a lot of concrete, the chandeliers in the casino were nice, the parking garage was being worked on, so parking was a major pain.Bottom line, there's nothing wrong with this place, but there's no reason to stay here, either."
238,402,"May 20 2009 	Just as we remembered!!	Stayed here about 10 years ago and the atmosphere hasn't changed. Friendly staff, great service, comfy beds, good selection of food choices, and an awesome pool area! This hotel is on one of the busiest corners on the Strip but not overcrowded like some others. A relaxing &quot;home&quot; to come back to after a long day in Vegas!"
239,402,"May 18 2009 	Staff was wonderful!	We stayed at the Monte Carlo the last week of April. The hotel staff couldn't have been nicer and we had a few perks while staying there including some free casino play, buy one get one free meal, etc. The rooms were okay ...nothing special but clean. We would have liked to have a refrigerator and a coffee maker but they were not in the room. All things considered, the location was great and we really enjoyed ourselves!"
240,402,"May 18 2009 	Just okay	My husband and I just got back from a few days in Vegas. The stay was ordinary and nothing special about the Monte Carlo. The had a few small pools, only one was heated. The others were a small wave pool and a small lazy river. The hotel does not provide rafts for the lazy river complimentary, instead you can rent one for $14 or buy one. I suggest purchasing one before you come and just putting in suit case and blowing it up here. The pool also doesn't open until 9am - there is always a line waiting to get in and closes at 6pm, WAY TOO EARLY! The music is good at the pool and there are some waitresses delivering drinks that are around $9 each for the frozen ones. The casino was pretty slow and small compared to the other hotels. There were only two shops a $10 for everything and a sunglass shop. The others were hotel gift shops, no boutiques like the other hotels. The buffet was great for breakfast and Diablo's Cantina is attached to the hotel on the Strip. They had a great Happy Hour that started at 3pm with $3.00 drinks. The drinks change every half hour. They do not provide complimentary drinks and salsa even though it is a Mexican restaurant. You have to pay $4.00 and it isn't endless chips and salsa either. To me guest would stay and drink a lot longer if they had chips to munch on. The rooms were clean, even though the housekeeper missed a shooter from a drink under the table in the room. But they did a great job cleaning everyday. The hotel is older and could use a room renovation but it was comfortable. The only thing I could complain about was the walls are super thin. I could hear my neighbor cough, sneeze and hear the TV like it was in my room. So if you are a light sleeper I don't suggest this hotel."
241,402,"May 17 2009 	Stay somewhere else!	There are too many better hotels and better deals than the Monte Carlo this year. We go to Las Vegas for a week once a year and try 2-3 nights at different hotels each trip. This time, May 10-16, we stayed at Paris, M.C. and Sam's Town. The Monte Carlo room was on the worst I have ever been seen or stayed in. It was a like cheap budget hotel room that needed updating. It was small, noisy and filthy. Someone had put gum on the night stand by the lamp. I moved the lamp and left a tip, so housekeeping would see the gum. They took the money but left the gum. The only thing worst than the room was the buffet. We could not finish one item on the breakfast buffet, not even the orange (?) juice. The buffet was comped with the room, otherwise I would have ask for my money back. In fairness, they do have a nice (but crowded) pool area and it is easy to find your way around the hotel/casino.  Bottom Line - MGM should cut their losses on the City Center and spend the money upgrading their properties."
242,402,"May 17 2009 	Why can't drunks stay home	This was the 2nd time I stayed at Monte Carlo. Very nice hotel, however, my party and I were on the 13th floor and unfortunately next to several rooms of partiers that shouted obscenities all night - drank, talked very loud - slammed doors and pretty much were very wild. I believe it was a fraternity or sorority group. I called to complain after 1 pm one night as I feel you can have a good time without waking up other guests, without shouting obscenities, etc. Our final night was awful as the same loud group came upstairs around 3am swearing and making loud noises. When we left our rooms around 4 am to catch our plane, we noticed the wall hangings on the walls were ripped down and broken on the ground. Maybe Monte Carlo needs to have better security to silence these folks that think Vegas is only about drinking and being rude.As for the rest - the buffet was very good - the Brand Steak house was good - but pricey. Nice DJ pool party - only the pool closed at 6pm - what's up with that?"
243,402,May 16 2009 	The pool is AWESOME!	We didn't stay here but we did enjoy the pool! Great scene! I will stay here the next time we are in Vegas!
244,402,"May 15 2009	Monte Carlo made it right!!	I haven't been to Vegas in almost 20 years. Wow has it changed!!! As a familly, we have had a very difficult past few months with the death of my Dad and other issues, and it was my birthday. My eldest son who flys with West Jet decided to take me on a bit of a jaunt to regroup and heal my soul. I researched and planned for two months before going. I originally planned to stay at the LUXOR but with all of the negative reviews here, decided to go with the Monte Carlo plus we hade a room rate promotion. We new it was an older property, so we were not expecting the Bellagio. After a very trying day of long flights and airport confusion, we arrived and were tired, in need of a coffee and a sit down. The check in was smooth, but when we arrived to our room it was not satisfactory. When we called down to the desk we were swiftly given another room, we trudged down with our luggage to get our new key, went to the second room and found that it was not cleaned very well. We called down again and the front desk manager ( Leroy?) was very apologetic. He had another room for us, but asked us to stay where we were until he had the housekeeping supervisor check it out and would get back to us in a few minutes. We stayed in that room and waited for about half an hour. When Leroy called back, he indicated that the supervisor had checked that room plus two others on that floor and they all had presented with &quot;issues&quot;. Again apologising, he upgraded us to a Diamond Suite, he had the bell man come up with a key and to move our luggage. When we entered the Diamond suite it was fantastic!! We had a marble counter with chairs, a fridge, living room with pullout queen, dining area, a seperate bedroom with a king size, &quot;to die for&quot; pillow top bed and a huge bathroom with a huge jacuzzi tub. Oh My!! Given our low expectations, a very trying day and the events of the past few months, this was just such a terrific act of courtesy on behalf of the hotel and management. This room can be seen online but you cant get a price for it. Normally, I could not afford to book a room of this calibre so it was a definate treat of luxory. The regular rooms are nothing too spectacular, but if cleaned, and they upgraded the linens especially the bedspreads and maintained the rooms properly, they would be sufficiant for those on a budget. As they are, I think the quality is a little on the shallow side, but for the promo rate of $52/night they would be fine. The regular rate is alot higher. The wave pool was nice, but the lazy river was amazing. Our upgraded room (26002) overlooked the pool area and faced the construction which was not a problem for noise at all, (we come from a city so are used to some noise). The restaurants were Ok, some confusion regarding the Brand kitchen hours so we missed out on a nice meal. But the location was good, and if you can walk, you can get to lots of the other venues in short order to site see. We rented a car from dollar which is right in the lobby, thier staff need to get better training as she had us run all over las vegas to get to a wallmart when there was one just by the airport. The car itself needed maintenance and the upgrade although nice also needed maintenance as the air conditioner didn't work well, pretty tough when you are in the desert.( Went to Hoover Dam and Primm both quite nice and amazing.) The casino itself was quite tight. We had great luck at the MGM and downtown at the Golden Nugget, buffets are priced alot higher than they use to be but come on its been twenty years since I was there!!! . Sign up for a club card and use it as the comps were really great!! The players club desk staff were very helpfull in explaining the program and offering comps. We ended up only paying for our first night. Overall, it was a really great trip but only because the Monte Carlo made it right, right from the beginning. The staff are courteous and really seemed to care that we were having our needs met. Expecially thanks to Leroy. He was terrific."
245,402,"May 15 2009 	Great Place	I just returned from the Monte Carlo and I had a wonderful time. The room was immaculate and the staff exceptional. I had a problem with the air conditioning and they corrected it within 20 minutes. This included putting a new motor in the unit! The elevators never had you waiting for more than five minutes maximum. The beds were comfortable and the linen clean and pressed. I never heard any of the construction. If you want another room, ask to be moved away from it. I made this request before I arrived and it was honored. Take advantage of the summer special and you cannot go wrong. It allows you to use both properties and the pass to the club Rok is worth it. We had a blast there. My daughter rode the roller coaster at NY NY twice. The restaurant two for one in NY NY was wonderful but bear in mind that juice was $5 and coffee $4 so you will still pay about $20 for breakfast. The two for one buffet dinner was reasonable and there was a great selection. The midnight to 6 am steak dinner was delicious. I do not know what other people are complaining about because I think this is the bargain of Las Vegas in terms of price, location, and comfort. Planning to go back again soon."
246,402,"May 15 2009 	Nice hotel building work all around pool too crowded and noisy	The hotel is in a nice position, I would have preferred being a bit further in the middle of the strip but it was ok. There is building work going on all around the hotel, and in certain places you are handed cards by Mexicans which advertise girls to go to your room. These cards are thrown on the floor making parts of the streed very untidy and tacky. They are happy giving the cards out so they should be made to sweep up the mess.The pool is a disaster, it only opens from 9 till 6 ??? make sure you start queing up from 8.15. The sunshine is best to the right of the pool bar as the other areas go quickly into the shade. They cram you in like sardines, i couldnt lay my bed down or else it would have encroached on someone elses. In the afternoon its just a posing area for all the Americans wearing their Prada, or Gucci sunglassses, because it was so hot they constantly walk about in the lazy river making a nice float round impossible. Ive never seen as much alchohol drunk around a pool. There is also a DJ in the afternoon making a nice snooze an impossibility, the music is so lound you can feel it vibrating in your chest. There is a happy hour id Diablos, they spin the wheel every half hour then whatever the arrow lands on you get for $3 till the next spin. We didnt know this at first and our 2 beers cost $16 which is expensive. Go into Dicks bar in Excalibur and they do pitchers for $14, we had a 62 oz pitcher for $19 which was great. I wouldnt stay here again unless something was done with the pool area. The rooms were ok but not as dust or crisp free as i would have liked (dont poke about round the floor areas too much)"
247,402,"May 13 2009 	Disapointing	Pretty from the outside but old and outdated rooms. Bedding, towels and bathroom in desperate need of refreshing. Early morning noise from &quot;City Center&quot; construction next door."
248,402,"May 12 2009 	I am the biggest neat freak and extremely particular -LOVE it here!!!	This has been my third visit to the Monte Carlo in the last 2 years. I cannot say enough about this place...the rooms are immaculate and are very nicely decorated. The facility has everything you need and the pool is fabulous. (We visited from May 9 - May 11).I am beyond a neat freak (scared of staying in hotels for fear of bugs), but feel completely at home here. For business I always have to stay at the Venetian (which is lovely), but honestly, the Monte Carlo has the right combination of everything that I need on vacation -and the quality of the facility is great -even to satisfy a very picky person like me. We can afford to stay at a higher placed hotel, but choose to come here time after time. You'd be crazy not to check this out.The cleaning staff is outstanding -and trust worthy. I accidentally left my wedding ring and money in the hotel and it was there when I came back -it was out in the open and I am writing the hotel to compliment them on this."
249,402,"May 12 2009 	Monte Carlo - TERRIFIC !!	Travelled with a group of 20+ for my husbands 40th birthday - and we had a fabulous time ! Hotel was great, this dictated by the fact that at the end of every &quot;outing&quot; we all migrated back to OUR casino at the Monte Carlo - it was home ! Enjoyed an amazing birthday celebration dinner at the BRAND restaurant as well - pricey but wonderful. Our room was great - experienced no construction noise at all. The pool was crazy crowded - and for us one of the best days was a reserved cabana around the pool - do it, it was fantastic ! At check in time we had some confusion on the exact room we booked, but once we got our strip view room on the 23rd floor it was amazing. Vegas was great - 100+ temperatures so be prepared, and don't expect to come home winning your fortune, but it's VEGAS !!!"
250,402,"May 11 2009 	Liked it very much...	Stayed 5 nights in a Monaco Suite with view of pool and City Center.A beautiful, clean, spacious, comfortable room, at a very attractive price.Great service from all the staff.Valet parking was very quick.Terrific room service.NOISE FROM CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER ROOMS WAS NOT A PROBLEM FOR US WHATSOEVER.The place was busy and seemed to be thriving.The Casino was fun and the Hotel may not like knowing we won a bit more than we put in.The location was terrific for access to the things we wanted to see in Vegas.The view of City Center was interesting, and as they finish it up, it will be an amazing view.We intend to stay there again!"
251,402,"May 10 2009	Tired Around the Edge	This hotel is showing it's age but is perfectly adequate for a Vegas stay. It is right on the strip, great for going out &amp; sightseeing. The pool area is very cramped &amp; often noisy with 'fun' activities during the day. Bedroom walls are too thin , you can hear EVERYTHING going on next door! You have been warned! But the bed is comfy &amp; bathroom OK, nothing more than that, thin towels &amp; cheap products. The Monte Carlo is no where near as smart as other Las Vegas hotels but then it is not as expensive either."
252,402,"May 9 2009 	Beautiful Hotel...LOUD Hotel!	This is a beautiful hotel. However, we were not told about the MAJOR construction going on just outside of our window at all hours of the night...during the day, there was no less noise with the DJ blasting BOOM BOOM BOOM music by the pool. When we spoke to the front desk, they couldn't have cared less. They even said they get complaints about it all of the time. Also, I would like to add, that if you haven't been to Las Vegas in a few years, and you have any level of morality...don't bother. We were disgusted by the soft core porn that was EVERYWHERE! If you must go, for heaven's sake...DON'T BRING THE KIDS!!!"
253,402,"May 8 2009 	Mostly good - inspect your room first	Negatives:When we first arrived, our room still had some trash in it that housekeeping missed. Worst of all, a wet, dirty washcloth was left in the tub. We promptly changed rooms. They supposedly &quot;upgraded&quot; us by putting us in a &quot;high floor&quot; room, but the view wasn't as good of the strip. However, the view to the mountains was great, so we stayed. The room had a very strong and distinct marijuana smoke smell when we first walked in. But we just dealt with it because we were ready to hit the casino. By the next day it was gone. We later discovered that the walls are PAPER thin and we not only heard the neighbors next to us very clearly, but during the day, since our room overlooked the pool, the pool music was very loud and crystal clear coming into the room. We felt the consierges could have been more knowledgable (eg: WE knew that Wynn golf was now open to the public, and they didn't) as well. The beds were a tad too firm and the bathroom is extremely small.Positives:Location, location, location - excellent location! All of the staff were very nice and did try hard to accomdate our needs and answer our questions. The rates were fantastic compared to other hotels on the strip and it's still a nice enough place where we didn't feel that we were settling (too much). Once we were moved, the room seemed very clean (except the smell, and I think the carpets could use a good shampooing). The breakfast buffet was AWESOME and totally worth the money. We didn't try lunch or dinner. The fast food court came in handy for quick cheap meals on the run. The water pressure in the shower ROCKED!All in all, we would stay there again and we had a good time."
254,402,"May 7 2009 	Excellent Excellent Excellent	After reading all the bad reviews I am telling you this I am a very picky person but the Monte Carlo is Excellent in every way. There were no surprizes for us. We had seven rooms booked for a trip to the Grand Canyon, a family of nineteen and we had teen agers a one year old and a three year old. You do not have to walk through the caniso to get to your rooms. and the pool area is great, they honored all of our request for seven non smoking rooms away from the construction sight., The linens were clean and the towels and wash cloths are of top quality. we travel a lot and I would say this is one of the best we have stayed at. Do not believe all the bad reviews. I am christian and I would not miss lead you. The Monte Carlo is a excellent choice. We were there from May 2 to May 5 and check in and out was fast. Great Hotel, give it a try and you will be on here writing a good review also. 10 stars for the Monte Carlo and the construction is almost done and the lobby was spotless we had the breakfast buffet and it is right up there with the one in Hawaii. Great choices and the food is terrific. and it was only 12.88 a person and with a lot of choices a nd we loved It. you can eat there cheaper than the mcdonalds and it is better for you health wise"
255,402,"May 5 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	We stayed for three nights April 26 - 29 and were pleasantly surprised. The check in and out was a breeze as we were able to use the &quot;invited guest check in&quot; due to a comp for our room. We were in a deluxe room which room was clean, somewhat updated and had a very comfortable bed (I was surprised). The first night we stayed in a room with 2 queens, although we requested a king. However they indicated we could move to a king room the next day. The only problem with this was trying to occupy our room which finally happened around 4:00 p.m. and after my husband stood in the invited guest line for at least 45 minutes. The line only had a couple people, however they kept calling people over from the other lines. Needless to say, my husband was very frustrated! I guess we shouldn't complain as we were getting the room for free. so to speak.The bathroom was bigger than, say, New York, New York, but not as big as TI and Mandalay Bay.We loved the food court, my husband had a large breakfast at Sbarro every morning, brought my coffee and hash browns up to the room for me, and enjoyed the guacamole and chips at Rubios.Even though we don't like buffets in general, we had the lunch buffet on our last day and the price was around $30 (?) total. I enjoyed a &quot;made to order&quot; Philly Cheese Steak and thought it was something different than the usual made to order pasta etc.The casino is a bit dated (we stayed there shortly after it opened), but easy to navigate and had large aisles.We went out to the pool one day and the only complaint I have is that none of the beverage servers made it over to our area. I went to the pool bar and bought a double rum &amp; coke and Malibu &amp; diet for $33. The cups were probably 12 oz. Weather was high 70's, lower 80's. The crowds weren't bad, a sign of the times.I must say that the staff was friendly and nice compared to the staff at New York, New York when we were there in Oct 2008.We didn't eat at any of the other hotel restaurants, so I cannot comment there."
256,402,"May 5 2009 	Worst Experience in Vegas EVER!!!	We go to Vegas about twice a year and have stayed a many of the MGM Mirage properties. We almost always go to the pool and have never had such a horrible experience. First of all REALLY loud music at the pool started around 9am, so sleeping late was not an option. When we arrived at the pool there were no open seats, and hardly any room to walk for the matter. After waiting in line for 20 minutes for expensive drinks (its vegas expensive drinks are to be expected) we found out that the tube we rented for our 12 year old son was stolen from him by an adult male, not another child. A while later when we tried to use the replacement tube, we were splashed mercilessly by a bachelor party until my $20 drink was filled with pool water. This all happens as the lifeguard watches and laughs. I asked him to stop them or replace my drinks, he says he is helpless and talk to a manager. I do and the manager is also helpless and has to go get the General Manager of the pool. I never complain, but people were way out of hand touching other people and their belongings. while i am waiting in the wave pool for the GM to come talk to me a drunk man from a bachelor party jumps on my tube and tries to take it from me. I wrestle the tube away and yell at him and the man tries to punch me in the face. I am a woman by the way. Security comes, huge scene, nothing is done. They stand there staring at me and let him get away. Everyone on the whole property is helpless. The only thing i received after all of this were the free drinks i requested. Our child and parents were traumatized and the day ruined. No other comps were given even after further complaining about the out of control nature at the pool. We come to vegas a lot and go to some of the rowdier pools including club rehab at the hard rock and mandalay bay which is VERY busy. Nothing like this has EVER happend to us before. No one has ever even bothered us...even at CLUB REHAB- the wildest party on the strip! Never stay at the Monte Carlo unless you are just going to be in the casino the whole time, that was the only good part. We were woken up again sunday morning by a loud speaker making announcements for a wedding party at 8am. Stay at the Mirage, Mandalay Bay, the Paris instead- this was one of the worst guest service experiences of my life. I used to work in guest services...I don't complain unless something is very wrong and I NEVER write these reviews, the experience was just THAT bad."
257,402,"May 5 2009 	Pretty darn good place to stay	First time at this hotel, apprehensive considering the many poor reviews. The good: fast checkin and out, friendly staff, no construction noise, clean large room and bath, good convenient location, fast valet service, good food at the cafe, lively casino area. The bad?: tired room decor, some noise from neighboring rooms, slow shower drain, awful buffet, ridiculous internet access fees and poor tv station options.Overall for the price and location, a very good value (except for Sat nite stay which was over priced due to the Championship fight in town).The worst buffet prime rib ever. Nearly the worst bbq ribs, inedible. No wonder no lines on a friday nite. Should've gone to Brand the streakhouse.Overall, definitely will consider for our next stay."
258,402,"May 4 2009 	Don't waste your money or time	With all the hype about Las Vegas - we thought we were in for a great little 4 day get away! Boy, were we disappointed! I don't think we will ever plan another trip there and if we do, we sure won't stay at the Monte Carlo. We spent a lot of money there and the comps are terrible. We ended up getting 2 buffets a piece and we ate at the dinner buffet once while we were there and it was comparable to a Luby's, but twice the price. Taking advantage of our comped buffets when we checked out almost took an act of congress. The people at the players club are very inexperienced and every time you want to know about your comps they have to get on the phone to some secretive &quot;marketing&quot; person. The front desk is just as bad - they can't tell you anything about your comps. Therefore everyone is sending you running around from desk to desk.The rooms are okay, but don't expect fresh towels daily and don't expect coffee in the morning when you wake up. Unless you pay the outrageous price for room service coffee or go downstairs and purchase coffee from McDonald's or Starbucks. Another thing - bring your own sodas or water with you to the room because there are no complimentary bottles of water left in your room and the soda machine on at least 2 floors that we checked was taped up and out of order! After going to two floors looking for a soda machine that worked, we just gave up and went back to our room.They did not have wifi internet access. You had to plug into an ethernet port and then that did not even work. You could access the internet by PAYING a $5 minimum at a little public kiosk in their lobby. If you want to print your boarding passes from there they charge you another $1 per page!!!!The slots were so tight that we did not see anyone winning anything. We spent a lot of money and playtime in their casino and it was crap.My advice: don't go. If you want to go to an excellent hotel/casino that knows how to treat their patrons and don't want to travel to Las Vegas, try L'auberge du lac in Lake Charles, LA. It is a gorgeous hotel and casino, great staff, friendly people, wonderful food, and complimentary beverage bars in the casino for sodas, water, and coffee."
259,402,"May 4 2009 	Not Great	First, I'm a huge fan of MGM Mirage properties. Having said that...Room needs a major update and a good cleaning. Bedding is at Holiday Inn-levels, which is surprising.Bathroom is pretty bad. Not clean, amenities are not what they should be, towels are worn out and bath is unappetizing. The shower lever barely works.Pool is crammed with lounge chairs because of the construction right next to it, so probably not the best experience.PROS: Not a huge hotel to walk through and elevators are right off the lobby. Lobby area looks nice. Great mid-Strip location."
260,402,"May 3 2009 	Fine but for the pool.	While I acknowledge that enjoying a quiet moment reading by the pool isn't the first thing most people look forward to when planning a trip to Vegas, it can provide a welcome respite from clanging slot machines. Just not at the Monte Carlo. There is not a single square yard of the sizable pool area that is not assaulted by loudspeakers pumping in hip hop music at a high volume. Reading or relaxing poolside is utterly impossible as MC tries to create some sort of &quot;party atmosphere&quot; at all hours--even before noon. I've got no problem with hip hop nor with nurturing a &quot;pool party&quot; atmosphere for the guests who love that stuff, but surely MC could set aside a section of its pool area for guests who value a little peace and quiet for a while and who do not address one another as &quot;dude&quot;."
261,402,"May 2 2009 	Never again...	this hotel has so much potential, but fails miserably.my first complaint was the pool! on of the deciding factors for staying here was the incredible pool. my wife and i managed to hang out for all of 15 minutes! the DJs were probably the worst i have EVER heard! its not that i dislike techno, i dont...but just because you have software that will match two beats together, this does not make you a good DJ!!!this crap started around 9am and went until 6pm.the construction eyesore SUCKED! it true vegas style, someone decided to build8, yes count them 8, structures on the same site...right next door to the hotel! work was going 24/7, with the real noise starting at 6am!the restaurants suck royally. i think that the only place open aside from the fast food joints was that brew pub, and the insanely over priced steakhouse. and speaking of the fast food, who ever would have thought that any Subway restaurant ANYWHERE would actually charge 12$ for a sandwich.the casino drinks were watered down and almost non alcoholic, tonic water was always substituted with flat club soda/sour mix. when you actually ordered a drink from the bar it was 9$.i was pretty much blown away by what they try to charge for stuff here. i expect hotel convenience stores to be a bit over priced, and having been to vegas probably 10 times prior, i expect 'vegas pricing'. however, on this trip i was truly dumbfounded at how ridiculous las vegas businesses have gotten in charging their customers the insulting prices they actually get away with.and so with this trip i bid farewell to las vegas forever. let the coked up yuppies from LA have it."
262,402,"May 1 2009 	Best deal on the strip	Room was very nice and comfortable. Bathroom was large and accommodating. Very clean. Staff was courteous and helpful. Pool was fun even for adults, we loved the lazy river with its self propelling current. It was almost as good as being at the beach. We enjoyed the poolside bar and drinks were allowed in the lazy river. We got awesome pictures to take home with us. We left our personal belongings at our lounge chairs without any problems. Thanks you Monte Carlo for a &quot;Girls Weekend&quot; we will never forget. Love your deals for rooms on a budget while still getting all the value of a full-priced stay."
263,402,"May 1 2009 	Lovely hotel - great base for stay in Las Vegas	I'm a little surprised by some of the reviews for the Monte Carlo having just stayed there. Having said that we did not go to Vegas to sit by a pool all day - it was our first visit and we're out and about each day. If you are going to relax then yes it's probably not ideal - from the little I saw of the pool area it did seem cramped and there is a buidling site looming over. However it was purely a base for us.We had a great view of the strip. Our room was very clean and comfortable with two big beds and a great shower. The rest of the hotel was very clean with the usual casino, food court, restaurant and buffet places. We liked the fact that although it had all this - as it was not particularly a themed hotel it was better and a bit more of an escape from the others.The staff were very helpful and very well organised - especially in the buffet section - almost military! We only ate in the buffet for breakfast and once for dinner and it was excellent food and value.The building site next door did take the wow factor off the strip a bit and it would be unfortunate if you were looking out onto it.We thought the hotel was good value, comfortable and good location as it sits pretty much in the middle of the main hotels. Las Vegas itself is amazing although very tiring and if you are going to site see rather than relax - although the hotels are themed differently they are all pretty much the same format. If you like loads of gambling and shopping then Vegas is for you!"
264,402,"May 1 2009 	Very nice stay	Stayed in Vegas frm 4/27-4/30 &amp; got a great rate of $47.06/night!! How can you pass that up in this economic time! First time at this location &amp; thought it was very nice. The room is clean, the bed comfortable. It's shows a little wear but that's fine. Update w/flat screens, and a plug for cellphone by the desk would help but there is a laptop wire/jack available. Check in/desk service was pleasant &amp; courteous, housekeeping was very good. Food court w/Starbucks, Sbarro, some chinese place is there and the Cafe is open 24hrs, is very good. (Food court at the Venetian is better.) Did not eat at Diablos or the French restaurant or swim in the pool. The gambling tables were fine, there's a lot of penny &amp; nickel slots which was fun.I recommend getting the bus passto get around town on the &quot;Deuce&quot;. The 24 hr pass is $7 or a 3 day pass @ $15 &amp; can be purchased right on the bus. Unlimited rides during the time frame!! Well worth the price since one bus ride is $3. And since the buses on &quot;the Strip&quot; are double decker, go up the stairs to get a view of the night life. The bus stops right in front of the hotel when coming fromthe Fremont (north) direction but to head back that way, you have to get to the front of the MGM to catch the bus.They say Vegas is not doing so well since conventions/conventioneers are down &amp; the economy is bad, but there sure seemed to be a lot of people!! It felt like the same Vegas to me!Also, allow extra time for your shuttle pick up to the airport. Allowed an extra 1/2 hour but since there were so many hotel stops, it got late. What ever they tell you when you place your call for pickup, add 30 mins.Overall, this is a 3.5 rating."
265,402,"Apr 29 2009 	A good time despite construction work	I agree with previous comments regarding construction work which very much impacted on an otherwise good hotel. The pool area is indeed 'packed like sardines' and the level of music noise is at times disturbing to say the least., particularly if you want a rest after a night gambling and drinking which is a part of a vegas holiday for us. Also because of building work there is a limit to the sunshine at the pool which is again very nice but people are therefore struggling to find sunbeds and it felt more like being in the med with attempts to reserve beds in the better areas. The dust from the construction site was indeed a pest and overall we were disappointed with the sunshine element of this holiday. The hotel areas - rooms, buffet and casino are nice; very clean, with excellent service but could perhaps do with a lick of paint and updating. All this said we did have a good holiday. However I would be cautious for the future regarding the pool and limits to the sun."
266,402,"Apr 29 2009 	Great Hotel for a cheap price	This hotel to me was kind of a hidden gem. I thought it was very elegant on the inside but very affordable. The rooms were nice and we never had a problem with noise or house keeping. There was a lot of construction going on next door so there was quite a bit of dust in the air but the noise was never a problem. The pools were packed with kids but still very nice. They have a small wave pool and lazy river which was really nice. We had no problems finding chairs and the adult pool is separate from the kids area. We managed to find a little kiddy pool tucked into a hidden area that was great for laying out in. Not many people came in and the water was shallow enough to sit in but still get sun. This hotel is in a great location, right next to New York, New York and across the street from Planet Hollywood. The restaurants are nothing special so I'd recommend going somewhere else to eat but they did have a nice little food court with a subway, starbucks, mcdonalds, sbarro's and some kind of chinese food. The only problem is that it closed early and if you were out looking for a late night snack after coming in from the bars you were out of luck. Occasionally the sbarro's would stay open late but the pizza was very limited and it was only open till 2:00.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. My friends and I loved it and would deinitely go back."
267,402,"Apr 29 2009 	A Poem on the Monte Carlo	My review of this hotel was that it was just so soBut it's not necessarily a bad place to go.What was nice was that there wasn't a casino that you need to walk through,but instead is a simple lobby and a few stores too.It's just a basic hotel if you need a place to crash,and you don't have to worry about spending a lot of cash.The pool was big and there was this lazy river to ride,but it was filled with people's suntan lotion as you rode the tide.The location was fine and not really out of the way,and it's a basic place-what more can I say."
268,402,"Apr 28 2009 	Don't do it... words can't describe how they've ruined a great hotel	This was my fourth stay at the Monte Carlo over the past five years or so and I was really looking forward to it. It's always been good value, it's a great location and while it can't offer good bars and restaurants like other strip hotels it has a solid quality to it that has always appealed. And my wife and I loved relaxing out by the excellent pool..... until now.As we neared the colossal building site loomed into view, engulfing the hotel on three sides in noise, dust and site traffic. But not to worry, that's not really the hotel's fault. Our room was decent enough and we were checked in early. The windows were caked in dust from the site, rendering the extra paid for a view a little wasteful, but you don't go to Vegas to sit in your room, do you. We still weren't going to let such things bother us.But the gross mismanagement of this hotel became clear when we decided to hit the pool, which is an essential part of a Vegas stay. Much of the pool side terraces have been sold off to the building project and the remaining area sees sunbathers packed in like sardines between the various pools. But fortunately the management at the Monte Carlo have found a way to limit the number of people competing for space in the sun.The music around the pool is so loud and so awful that it destroys any notion of a relaxing lie out by the pool, reading or drinking. It is so loud it will literally make you feel sick. I wish I was joking.I'm no stranger to outdoor music festivals and rock concerts but have never heard a noise like it. I imagine they are trying to drown out the noise of the building site, but even still, it makes the pool totally off-limits. My wife and I like to gamble and have a fair few drinks of an evening and then crash out by the pool to recover. it's the only way to be in Vegas. But not so at the Monte Carlo, not any more it would seem.Worse still, not to sound too geriatric about this, but the music sounds like the creation of the manager's son who has begged his dad to let him play some of his mixes by the pool. It's truly appalling. The sort of thing you'd expect to hear if you bought a tone deaf nephew a set of decks for Christmas, played at a volume rivaled only by a Boeing 747 taking off.However... and this is a nice touch. If you looked to escape into to the Brew Pub for a bite of lunch, not only does it look like a canteen for the monstrous building site, covered in dust and littered with hard hats and high-visibility jackets, they also had a fire alarm which went off every 15 minutes for the duration of our stay. This was explained away as &quot;it's nothing to worry about&quot;... well, it is pretty annoying. Much like the way the Monte Carlo is now run.The accommodation and staff were pleasant and despite the MASSIVE building site, the location of the Monte Carlo remains outstanding. However, some basic but important failings mean this is a hotel I could never return to, even in a couple of years when the building work may finally be complete.We went on to the Luxor instead. Not ideal but in comparison it is sooo much better. However, if it wasn't for conferences filling many of the better hotels we would have gone for Caesars Palace which now is uncontested as my favourite Vegas hotel, where previously the Monte Carlo was snapping at its heels."
269,402,Apr 24 2009 	Can't wait until the surrounding construction is over...	I like the Monte Carlo quite a bit. They've comped me rooms several times. Some of the downsides at the moment is all the City Center construction going on. Plus Internet access is $14.99/day! That's pretty pricey. It's not even WiFi. They WiFi in your room is hit and miss (mostly miss) but it DOES work out by the pool area if you stay close to the building. They got rid of all the Wheel of Fortune slots that I liked so I'm going to have to look elsewhere. I do like the Brew Pub and it was great to see all the different playoff games going on while you ate.
270,402,"Apr 23 2009 	FANTASTIC VALUE	Have stayed @ both Monte &amp; MGM --- prefer Monte. MGM entails TONS of walking (we stayed in a regular double the 1st year &amp; JUST to go down &amp; pickup your morning coffee; was a 'trek'!) Monte has had better rates, too (3 years in a row)....and, after Monte's Concierge Floor has it 'hands down' over MGM's &quot;Signature&quot; (food-wise AND service-wise)Great location - you're right there @ NY NY, Excaliabur, &amp; Trop., M&amp;M World &amp; the 1/2-price Tix Booth are right across the street, you have a CVS &amp; a Walgreen just STEPS away...to pick up incidentals, Luxor &amp; Mandalay are a short tram-ride, &amp; you have MGM and the Monorail - to go down to the other end of the strip."
271,402,"Apr 22 2009 	ok but rooms are average	the price was what we could afford and we enjoyed our vacation staying at the monte carlos, the buffet is good just close to early Me and my husband was going on vacation but really didn't. Have money for the high end hotels so staying at the monte carlos was ok and affordable"
272,402,"Apr 19 2009 	Very nice hotel	The hotel in the south of the strip near the City Center area. The room was OK and very clean and the service I received was very good, The Buffat was very good with the best dessrts. Very important to mentione that they have parking area with no charge but there is limites space and it is not easy to find a spot."
273,402,"Apr 19 2009 	Okay but not the best I've had at the MC	We have stayed at the MC many times. This time we stayed in the Spa suite, because it was an excellent price. The room itself was decent and large. It was very clean, except for the stained carpets. The spot lights over the bed and the jacuzzi didn't work. The curtain by the jacuzzi only came up half way. So, for what we paid it was fine, but if I would have to pay what they normally ask, it would not be worth it. Our room faced the construction, but I didn't feel the noise was that bad at all. It's actually improved since some of our prior stays. (They are working more inside the buildings now).You could occassionally hear the beeping of the trucks when they were backing up. The bathroom was large. It was nice to have a fridge in the room also. The check in/out went quickly. The valet staff was AWESOME!! You never had to wait for your car long and they were friendly and asked if you needed directions. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat they have a food court with many options. We didn't use the food court, but ate at Brand, which was good and in the Pub. We didn't spend a day at the pool, because it was shaded over, by the CC. The MC sent us an e-mail to sign up for text messaging to hear about the specials and activities that would be going on while you were staying with them. Don't even bother trying to sign up. tried it before we left and while we were down there. We never received one message from them.We didn't have a terrible stay, but with each stay I feel the MC is getting a little out dated. I would stay at the MC again, but I am thinking about staying somewhereelse next time. We usually stay in the Monaco Suite &amp; this time the Spa Suite. To upgrade to those categories or room, I could be staying at the Bellagio, Palazzo or Wynn in a regular room that is just as nice for the same price. (IMO)If you want something that's clean and nothing too exciting it is worth a stay. If you something a little more, I wouldn't recommend it."
274,402,"Apr 18 2009 	Excellent Service - Great Hotel	I highly recommend this hotel. I've stayed in many in Vegas and this is now my favorite. Best value for the price in Vegas. Very high end and high quality. Staff is the best around Vegas. Hotel and casino are great. Very comfortable hotel to stay. Suitable for couples or families. I travelled with my teen daughter at spring break. We shopped and relaxed at the pools. The pool area is great for families. They have lazy river, wave pools, jacuzzi and regular pool. Very relaxing and good music playing at pool area. Located in great area and you can walk around the strip easily from this hotel. They have a foodcourt with lots of good places like Starbucks, Sbarro Italian, Hagan Daz ice cream, Mcdonalds. The market cafe restaurant we ate in served excellent meals and lots of choices for everyone. We went to the Lance Burton magic show which was also excellent. It's for families and suitable for children, teens and adults. Every person we encountered who worked at this hotel provided excellent service. The room was very nice and quiet. We slept well in this hotel. We moved from the Flamingo (which was horrible) and the front desk let us check in early. The gift shop has nice things for souvenirs. The casino is comfortable and fun to play in. The fitness room is great. Valet parking the best in Vegas with short waits to get your car. I highly recommend this hotel!!!"
275,402,Apr 15 2009 	great guys on concerige desk very helpfull	rooms clean and comfortable very friendly staff see jay or mike at concerige desk for the best help and advice on things to see and do
276,402,"Apr 15 2009 	The place to stay for elegant style great service in Vegas!	We chose to stay at the Monte Carlo out of all Vegas hotels, since we got a great deal and it was in a decent location on the strip. The hotel was very clean with an elegant decor. Overall the casino floor was much quieter than some of the overcrowded ones at Bellagio and Caesars. We came to appreciate this quietness after seeing the hustle and bustle that is Vegas.There is a very convenient food court right near the hotel rooms area, consisting of: Starbucks, Subway, McD's, Manchu Wok, and Rubios. Great for a quick bite or snack.We stayed in the Monaco Suite, which was just lovely. Our room faced the side of the hotel (toward Excalibur) so we were away from the construction noise that is currently going on with the development of the City Center complex on the other side. Be sure to request a room away from the construction, unless you want to be woken up at 6am every day. The room was spotless and had a very modern appeal with dark furniture, a king bed, a suede couch, a floor-length mirror, 2 bathrooms, flat panel tv, and calming blue-gray walls. No complaints about the room at all - it was great!The location of the hotel is not as center strip as one would imagine. It's right next to New York, New York and somewhat diagonal from Planet Hollywood, but the blocks are SO HUGE in Vegas that it takes forever to walk anywhere. I would probably stay north of Planet Hollywood next time, because that's where I spent most of my time (Bellagio, Caesars, Venetian, etc). Don't get me wrong though, Monte Carlo is a beautiful hotel that I think is sometimes overlooked. They offer some great pricing, so definitely worth staying at if you're on a budget!"
277,402,"Apr 12 2009 	Poor Average Mediocre.................	Checked in 29th March for 2 weeks. Check in fine. Asked for room high up away from construction. Had to pay extra $10 per night for room on 25th floor. Room looked over strip but was in very poor condition. Furniture chipped marks on carpets, sheets and blankets very tired. Bed spread very worn!! Bathroom ok though shower head was too low and I'm onlt 5'9&quot;!!! So if you are taller bend for the shower. Bed side light flickered every time you went near the cabinet.  The last time we stayed at the Stratosphere but this time we thought we were paying more cash for a better Hotel. How wrong we were. This hotel needs a complete makeover the only thing I can say was the beds were very comfortable although the pillows were so thin even laying on 3 of them you hit the matress. Had room service and at $77 you would have expected it to be hot!! like everything else average."
278,402,"Apr 12 2009 	Average Hotel OK if you get a good deal.	I have stayed in 8 different hotels over 6 visits to Vegas. Monte Carlo is average at best. If I had payed full price I would have been very disappointed. If you can get a great deal, and are looking for an average room, consider the Monte Carlo. The building looks very dated inside. The staff has a neutral attitude; not rude but not enthusiastic either. The casino was quiet as was the pool; some people bay find that appealing. The pool area is nice except that the City Center construction looms over it.Our package included a bunch of &quot;extras&quot; that were pretty much useless. The free slots $$ offered is what anyone gets if they join the players club. The food court coupons were a bunch of buy item one get item 2 half off coupons. The 2 free buffets were good and the free spa passes would have been OK if we had used them.The &quot;2 drinks at Diablo's&quot; coupon was useless because Diablo's is a joke. No staff, terrible service and a hostess that is perpetually talking on her cell phone.We did not have a room on the City Center construction side, so I cannot comment on the construction noise.The location is OK but the hotels on the other side of the strip are more convenient because that is the side the monorail is on.We ate at the Dragon Noodle restaurant and enjoyed it very much. Good food, friendly staff, reasonable prices and good selection. I would recommend it.Overall, Monte Carlo was kind of a let down but for the price we paid, it was OK. For a few $$ more, say $40.00 - $60.00 / night you can stay at much better hotels like MGM.If you are looking for a quiet, average hotel on the strip, you can stay at Monte Carlo for around $45.00 / night right now."
279,402,"Apr 12 2009 	Decent place location for the value nothing too fancy.	We stayed April 9-11 and we thought overall the hotel was decent. We had the basic delux room. I thought the room was just fine, again nothing fancy, but it was clean and comfortable which is all I wanted. The furnishings were updated nicely. The only complaint we had was the water pressure in the shower wasn't great, and the faucet was dripping. We called the next morning to tell them about it and a guy came up to fix it and walked right in when we were still in bed partially naked. :O( But it wasn't traumatic! He was nice and apologized and came back later to fix everything to normal. They gave us 2 free buffet comps though which was nice to have for dinner. They are also building the new City Center next door, and I was woken up around 6am to beeping noises from trucks reversing and other construction noises. My husband slept through it though. I brought ear plugs from reading the other reviews and those helped ALOT! We stayed in room 236 on the 11th floor and it was the nearest to the construction. Overall it was tolerable for two people living in the Oregon country. I think their amenities are ok. Compared to hotels like Planet Hollywood, MGM, Paris, etc... I think it is on the lower end. Their pool is a pool, but the others outdo it. We did like their Brand lounge, which they offered 2 for 1 drink deals. The buffet wasn't that great. The food was ok selection wise, and the flavors were ok. I am glad we didn't pay $18 pp for it.I think the hotel is fine for the location and deals you can get there. I would have rathered stay at a hotel like PH, or Paris because of the location and amenities. It's nice to have shops closer."
280,402,Apr 12 2009 	Nickled and Dimed	Another MGM property where they try to soak you for every penny they can. Extra costs: internet $14.99 per computer; no coffee or tea in room; $2.00 per page to print boarding passes.
281,402,"Apr 11 2009 	Nice place to stay	Took this hotel as part of a USAir pkg. Hotel was clean right on the strip. Has several fast food and sit down restaurants on site so it's easy to make a choice without having to leave the property. Make sure to tell the desk clerk that you do not want a room on the north side facing the construction of the new city centre. Talked to one person who made them change their rooms because of the noise.If you're a senior, ask for a senior discount on coffee at McDonald's which opens at 6:00 AM. Can also get free refills. Great for early risers from the east."
282,402,"Apr 7 2009 	Just OK.	I stayed at the Monte Carlo for 3 days recently with my mother and 2 adolescent daughters. The lobby of the hotel is relatively impressive, and check-in was fairly painless. The room was not all that impressive. It was kind of small and a little dingy, though the bathroom was really nice. The beds were comfortable, except for the non-fitted sheets which did not want to stay on the mattress. I asked for a room away from the construction noise, and did not hear any of the construction noise while in my room, or elsewhere on the premises. I did hear noise from the adjoining rooms, and was awakened once around 4:00 a.m. by a couple of lovebirds in the room next door.The pool area is nice, though it was a bit too chilly for us to swim while there. I didn't spend a lot of time in the casino, so can't really comment on it. The food court was very handy considering we had kids with us. We had the buffet once, and it was very good, especially the desserts. Much better than the Excalibur's, which is the only other Vegas buffet I've tried. The biggest gripe I had is with the internet service. They advertise high speed internet for $14.99 a night. What I didn't learn until I got there was that that price is PER laptop (we had 3) and you can only use 1 laptop at a time, because it is not wireless. I ended up going with a service called Traveler's Wi-Fi, which was much cheaper, but I had a crappy connection the entire time I was there. There were probably better alternatives, but of course, I couldn't research them without an internet connection to begin with. I guess you don't go to Vegas to stay on the internet, but if that's something that's important to you, you might want to research it before you go. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but definitely nothing to write home about."
283,402,"Apr 6 2009 	Much better than expected.......	My husband and I plus four other couples recently stayed (March 28th through April 1st)at the Monte Carlo. I was really worried when I read some of the reviews because I had done the booking for our whole group. All 10 of us agreed that we would stay there on our next visit to Las Vegas.Our room was on the 27th floor and facing away from the construction. It was quiet, comfortable and clean. We upgraded so we could have a king-sized bed because there weren't any left at our price level. We paid $10 extra a night; however, it was comped when we checked out. I thought that it would be worth asking for. The casino host notonly comped the room but also the meals that were charged to our room.Every service person we had contact with was helpful and courteous. We especially enjoyed the staff (Karen specifically) in the coffee shop.The casino was quieter and smaller than a lot of the other casinos. It was easy to findour way around. We also liked having the food court close to the elevators."
284,402,"Apr 6 2009 	Wish we had stayed at Ceasars Palace	We stayed at this hotel 7 years ago and, apart from the lobby, the rooms have got very tired looking. We, like others on here asked for a room away from the construction but with a view of the strip. Well, the first room was on the 9th floor (?) and had a view over the roof of the multi-story car park and about an inch view of the MGM opposite! The next day we were moved to the 21st floor and although a better view it was still a very tired looking room and very dark. Do not order food in Sbarros on the casino floor as it was stone cold, over cooked and rubbery. Nothing good or spectacular stood out for us in this hotel and woud therefore never go back there. The next time we go we will stay at Ceasars Palace for its location, shopping and friendlier atmosphere."
285,402,"Apr 6 2009 	Good value 3.5 star Strip hotel if you stay on the quiet side	We booked a block of rooms at Monte Carlo for a trade show. My third business stay at MC...Rooms are clean, spacious and well furnished, if starting to show some wear. I would give MC a 3.5 star, solid 4 star if rooms were refurbished.Unbelievably low weekday rate $49 per night (during a trade show!) Ripoff internet at $14.99/day and SLOOOOOOOOOW.Great Strip location near New York and MGM Grand. Close to airport, not walkable to LVCC (Taxi is best option). Nicely decorated and several good restaurants and food court. Friendly and efficient staff. &quot;Cafe&quot; is very good and a decent value for breakfast (starting $9.99). Casino is relatively small but I was not there to gamble. Pool looks nice but I did not swim either. As others have noted, stay on the &quot;non construction&quot; side on upper floor away from City Center construction, due for completion December 2009 if they don't run out of money. Most CC heavy construction (demolition, pile driving etc.) is winding down, but is still noisy on City Center side of Monte Carlo. Avoid frontage road behind CC, construction access. Parking could be an issue but new garage looks due to open soon."
286,402,"Apr 5 2009 	I've been to hundreds of hotels and this one was the worst	In March, my fiancee and I spent 3 nights at the Monte Carlo Hotel &amp; Casino. Upon check in, we let the clerk know that all we wanted was a quiet room away from the City Center construction, on a high floor facing I-15 and with a clean king bed. The room as it turned out was absolutely disgusting. The shower had hair on the wall, the floor was dirty with bottle caps from the previous occupant and you could hear water running through the walls quite often. The room had no queen so we complained to the front desk and they said they had no more and to check the next day. We checked the next day and they put us in a king bed on a different wing of the hotel. At about 4 am, we started to hear banging noises (metal) and discovered that they had placed us right on top of the construction area. I asked to speak with management and all they could offer were excuses about the noise both in and out of the hotel. We stayed in three different rooms in three nights and all were equally appaling in terms of cleanliness. We immediately removed the bed cover and tossed it on the floor as there was no telling what lived on it. I have stayed at hundreds of hotels in numerous countries in my lifetime and this was the absolute worst. New York New York next door is nicer and I've heard the Venetian is nice too."
287,402,"Apr 5 2009 	Bed Bug Infestation!	To add to the noise in the hallways, my significant other woke up complaining that something was biting him. We found bugs in the bed. We reported this to the hotel staff and they did confirm there was a bed bug infestation in our room. We were told to go to the doctor and have our luggage deconaminated. They would consider reimbursing us. The person we dealt with never once volunteered to comp our stay which was only $59.95 per night, so I asked. She said she'd have to think about it. We will not stay at the Monte Carlo again."
288,402,"Apr 3 2009 	Great value in the strip	We stayed in the Monte Carlo for two nights in March 2009. We booked a pkg in their website, with a very good price and some extras, like two buffets, two drinks, etc. First time in Vegas for both of us, and we stayed in three hotels, and I have to say the Monte Carlo is as good as the others. I was a little afraid because some of the reviews here werent great, but our experience was good. Check in took five minutes in total, and while we were in line the bell approach us, and took care of our luggage in a second in a great mood. I asked for a room away from the construction work, and it was honored without a problem, and even they gave me alternatives to choose from. The room was big, maybe the only problem was that it was a little dark, but it had to be because the orientation. However, any of the other hotels had a main light in the ceiling anyway... The bathroom had enough room, wasnt huge, but bigger than the average house bathroom. I understand when people say that the furniture is a little old, because it is true, but nothing extreme, it is not run down. We went to the pool, and tried the lazy river, and it was extremely fun! The pool area is close to the construction site, but I didnt notice at all. We tried the buffet and the casino, and loved both of them.When we went for our complimentary drinks at Diablos, the girl said to us to dont even bother to charge them to the room, that we were fine, so it was a very nice gesture from her, because in other places made us to show all kind of proof to redeem them.We had foos in the food court late at night once, and it was great to have some cheap, late night option just there.The location was good for me, everything in Vegas is so huge that you have to walk anyway! In addition, the casino and public areas are not very crowded, like in other popular hotels.I think this is a perfect option for good location, good quality and an affordable price in the strip."
289,402,"Apr 2 2009	awsome	We went to Vegas in February, The location of the hotel is very good. The rooms were clean and ready at 10 AM. Which was very good because we got there in the morning at 9 am. The stuff was friendly. I recomend to buy the double decker pass its 15$ for 3 days, and you can get on and off everytime you want it goes every 15 minuts. The Strip is long. The hotels are beutifull but they are owned byt 2 owners so its not worth to spend hundreds of dollars on the hotel rooms, the rooms are the same only diffrence is the Lobby Then Venetian lobby is very beautiful but the rooms are the same what we had in Monte Carlo. and anyways you dont go to vegas to hang around in the room =)=) The all you can Eat buffe is 20$ for 1 and its very good, but next door at Excalibur have 2 for 1 so you pay 20$ for 2. from 2to6 pm. Overall we loved our trip and the hotel and the fly. We flew with sunwing so we had a complimentary dinner drink and massage hehehe :D"
290,402,"Apr 1 2009 	OK but not exactly what expected	Nice hotel, great location on the strip if you want to see other casinos/hotels. Major construction makes parking more than a nightmare. Hotel not crowded, yet they still didn't have the room we reserved and wanted us to pay for the upgrade to get what we reserved. Queen sized beds are more like doubles."
291,402,"Mar 31 2009	Stay somewhere else!	A beautiful hotel, great location and large rooms are the pluses for this hotel, but if you're willing to pay for a less than clean, noisy room, dim lighting, $15.00 a day internet connection, and no coffee pot for those who 'gotta have it!', then do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!"
292,402,"Mar 31 2009 	Great location good prices	We stayed March 16-19th at the Monte Carlo. Asked for and were given a room with a view at no extra charge. Room had a great view of the MGM Grand and the Polo Towers. Construction noise was minimal. The room walls seemed thin, with pipe noise and toilet flushing next door very loud. Showers were the best I have experienced in a hotel. My only issue was that the room had no fan in the bathroom, and no fan came on in the room when you adjusted the temperature, so you had no way to drown out any outside noises when trying to sleep. I could hear the music coming from Diablo's bar out by the street unitl all hours. Comps seemed generous, with $50 food credit in the cafe for us, even though we wouldn't consider ourselves big gamblers. Would stay again. One thing though, the brew pub doesn't do any brewing since the change of ownership."
293,402,"Mar 30 2009 	Pretty good for the price but I wish some things were different.	The room wasn't horrible. BUT the walls were thin every time the person next to us flushed their toilet we could hear it. There are no rules about people in the halls being loud...I was woken up at 530 by drunk people taking a picture outside my door. The construction next door as beautiful as it will be is a 24/7 project so the noise is always there. (btw when they are done...not too much sun will be on the pool....its already being blocked out and its not even finished). Staff was pretty nice to us. The buffet I thought was over priced even for Vegas and it wasnt that good to begin with, THANK GOODNESS FOR ROOM COMPS!WARNING: if you have sensitive skin, request hypoallergenic sheets and towels....i broke out in hives due to the sheets and towels (which are very rough)."
294,402,"Mar 28 2009 	Good Value for your money.	I just spent five days at Monte Carlo, and it was a great stay. When I booked my vacation I requested a regular non-smoking room but since it was on a first come, first serve basis they ran of rooms before at 9:00 pm. How-ever they gave me a free upgrade to the 28th floor. It was a nice room, aside from a lamp that flickered everytime I touched the desk. The room faced the pool and construction site, but as I was awake before 6:00 am it never really bothered me. If the noise bothers you, they have a CVS pharmacy open 24 hrs and you can buy ear plugs. The bed was very comfortable, and the room was more spacious than what I thought it was going to be (I'm from NY so I am used to cramped rooms). The casino floor was well lit and easy to find what you are looking for be it a resturant or your favorite slot machine. The food was fantastic, I love thier breakfast buffet, and the graveyard special on steak and eggs is a great value. The casino and hotel is located on the strip next to some of the other more well-known casinos like New York New York, and MGM Grand. But what made my stay there the best was the staff. Very friendly, helpful, and courtious, I will deffinately go back there again."
295,402,"Mar 28 2009 	noisy pool noisy construction otherwise OK	My husband and I stayed here on 17-20th March. The rooms are fine and the location, in the middle of the south end of the strip, is good. Also the whole place isn't large by Vegas standards, so its not too far to walk to anywhere and is not too disorientating for a first-time traveller to Vegas. However right now the new CityCenter project is being constructed right next door and the construction goes on all night. It is extremely noisy and we were woken repeatedly. I would not recommend staying here until the CityCenter project is complete, unless you are deaf. The other problem was the pool - all Vega hotel pools pump music through speakers into their pool areas (without leaving even one little quiet corner) but the music at the Monte Carlo was blaring. It was more like a club. No way we could read a book or listen to an MP3 player while lying by the pool - we just gave up after about an hour. On the up side, we only ate once at the buffet (for breakfast) but would definitely recommend the breakfast buffet - it's in a nice room, well managed, with tasty and quality food, a bargain for the price."
296,402,"Mar 24 2009 	Very Nice Hotel!	My husband and I just returned from a long weekend at the Monte Carlo. We were lucky enough to have them comp our room for the entire stay, but I'd have no problem paying the $70 a night the Monte Carlo usually charges as the hotel/casino/rooms were all very nice. Check in was a breeze and they were very willing to give us a room with a view for no extra charge. The room was very comfortable and clean with great beds, nice bathrooms, a safe in the closet and great travel sized shampoos, lotions, etc. We spent a lot of time in the casino and for the most part, the dealers were friendly and easy going. We did run into one very grunpy shoe shiner and one rude dealer, but overall, great staff! The casino was lovely and the cocktail waitresses were FAST! They'll bring you anything you want, so don't forget to order top shelf! The location was nice - easy to walk to other casinos and the construction noise was not a problem. We didn't get a chance to swim, but the pool area looked nice. I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas and would rate the Monte Carlo as my new favorite!"
297,402,"Mar 24 2009 	Beep beep beep beep...	We were awoken at 7:00 am on Saturday morning to the sounds of construction vehicles backing up(beep, beep) saws and hammering etc. The City Centre Complex is being built right next to the MC. We were able to change rooms and it was somewhat quieter on Sunday morning. However, by Monday construction was back in full swing and though it was somewhat quieter, we were still awoken early by the sounds of construction. Bring earplugs or stay a hotel away from City Centre."
298,402,Mar 22 2009 	pretty upscale for an inexpensive hotel off the strip	Room clean. Liked having a food court. Free parking for guests. Not too far off the strip and much nicer than I expeced for the money.
299,402,"Mar 19 2009 	not bad not great	We stayed march 15-18th. The best part of the hotel is the casino and location. it was clean, not crowded and not too big. However, we play $15-$20 blackjack hands and they didn't even want your card unless you play at least $25 each hand. Other properties happily took our cards. the drink service was top notch 3 of the 4 days we were there and the dealers were all nice. the food court in the casino was also a plus. the weather was great which meant you had to be out early to get a chair. the pool area is TINY and there are not enough chairs and a lot of the area is shaded. the drink service at the pool was good. check in and out was very speedy. we asked to be away from the construction and that was honored. the room is just ok. we don't spend a lot of time there so that usually isn't an issue. the pillows they provide are the worst ones i have ever slept on by far. if they would provide better pillows, i would stay again if the price was really good."
300,402,"Mar 18 2009 	Very comfortable.	Overall this is a great place to stay. Check in was a breeze. We arrived at noon and they had several rooms available immediately. We had a choice of pool view, strip view or mountain view. We opted for the pool view, but once we got into the room you could hear the noise of construction so we changed to a much quieter mountain view. You should ask about construction noise when checking in. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. I was nervious after reading a review aobut bed bugs. After careful inspection and 3 nights later, there were no signs of any bed bugs or any other bugs.We booked a stay and play package, good value but probably would have been better off taking the AAA rate. They offered $20.00 in food court coupons. Keep in mind these are not vouchers. You order something and you get a free pop or free tortia chips. Not much of a savings and you won't use all the coupons. It also came with 2 buffet vouchers. This is worth between $20 &amp; $40 depending on the meal. The buffet was okay but you felt obligated to use them when there are so many other choices in Vegas.The food court was nice &amp; reasonable. McDonalds, Pizza, Mexican, Chinese, Starbucks and Hagendaz. There is also a reasonably priced Pub and mexican restaurant Diablo's. Diablo's was always busy with $3.00 drink specials from 3-7p.m. Temperatures didn't allow us to enjoy the pool. We did take a walk to the pool. It is a very nice area with one main pool, a lazy river and a wave pool. We did enjoy the casino's. We don't spend a lot of money gambeling but we did enjoy the monopoly game. This casino seemed to have the best payouts. We couldn't win anything any where else. The main pool water was very chilly....not heated. Location was good. Walking distance to many of the main hotels, casino's and shows. Across the street was a 1/2 off ticket booth for shows. This had the shortest lines of the 3 boots. Don't go to the one next to the M&amp;M store or Bills. Those lines were very long. I did learn that you don't get your &quot;real&quot; tickets here. Once you pay for your show you are directed to the venue where the show is to pick up your &quot;real&quot; tickets with seat assignment. This hotel isn't as plush as the Bellagio and the rooms aren't as big, but it is a very good value. If you are looking for the basic ammenities and not the most expensive restaurants and shops this is a great place to stay."
301,402,"Mar 17 2009 	Not worth it	Stayed at the Monte Carlo recently. Check in went smooth, they had a gentleman directling traffic which helped expedite the process. We got to our room (22-231) and we were greatly dissappointed. My travel companion had stayed there before and swore she remembered a much nicer room. The room was generally worn out and in poor shape. The bathroom floor had something sticky on it and the bathtub drained slowly. No extras such as coffee maker, refridgerator, and the TV was circa 1995. Cigarette burns in the carpet, a hole in my sheet, and a whole 2 tiny drinking glasses to toast our surroundings. I felt really dissappointed considering other places I had stayed for a similar cost or less had much more to offer. I will compliment the casino floor for being not so busy and for availability of games. Drink service was fair. I receommend to all to order a beer. Mixed drinks were super weak. Although, we kept commenting on a smell that reminded us kitty litter on the gaming floor. Never did figure that smell out."
302,402,"Mar 15 2009 	Monte Carlo does not disappoint	My brother and I just got back from a quick weekend in Las Vegas. We have stayed at the Monte Carlo before and decided to stay there again. I have stayed at several properties in Las Vegas and I continue to like the Monte Carlo. The resort is very clean and comfortable. It may not be a pristine as it once was, but it is definitely not run down in any way. The rooms are large and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. All in all, it is a very nice property.I tried to take a shower one day at around 4pm and the shower was not working. I called maintenance and they said that they had a pipe burst and it would be fixed in 15 minutes. In 15 minutes it was in perfect working order. My only complaint would be that I decided to print up our boarding passes and used their business center. They charged me $4 for the 2 minutes on their computer. I felt like that was a little bit of a &quot;nickel and dime&quot; thing, but other then that I cannot say enough good things about this resort overall.It may not be the most &quot;upscale&quot; property on the strip, but I would not hesitate to stay here. I'm not sure I would select it as a place to take my significant other if I was really trying to impress her, but other then that caveat, I would be back in a heartbeat."
303,402,"Mar 14 2009 	Average	The staff was generally okay. A few gems, and no one was outwardly rude. Rooms were less than average, and even though we asked to be placed away from the City Center construction, we had a front row seat. The noise wasn't as bad as we had heard, but the walls were way too thin. Every time someone in the hall opened or closed a door we jumped.The standard rooms were getting a little old and tired. The beds, pillows and bed coverings were not up to standard. Furnishings were worn. The bathroom was nothing special, but adequate.I would normally say the location was good, you had to navigate City Center construction. When it's over, I'm sure it will be fine.One item that bothered us was the how early the restaurants closed. At a quarter of ten, all were closed with the exception of the Cafe (which offered a VERY limited menu) and the food court. Only one restuarant even acknowledged us.The one restaurant we visited, Dragon Noodle, was very poor. That is another review, but trust me, stay away from it.The casino was well laid out. The games were a bit dated, but they had a good variety.Overall, I think you can do much better, expecially in this economy. And until the City Center project if completed, I would stay away."
304,402,"Mar 11 2009	Darn good value	Two couples (over 50, but hip) spent a week in Vegas in February. We have stayed at the Monte Carlo before and were confident in doing so again. We were not disappointed since it proved to be the same value as in years past. The rooms were clean and while not the Ritz Carlton, they were just fine. The lobby is very pretty and we got some great deals on stuff at the gift shop. Look for the 50% off shelves. Our only gripe was the construction noise. There is a HUGE project going on at the rear of the hotel and those guys start really early. On check-in, be sure to ask for a room on the east side of the hotel. Be specific about wanting to be away from the noise. We felt that odd numbered rooms on any floor would not be directly adjacent to the racket. All in all, we had a great time and would stay there again."
305,402,"Mar 10 2009 	Great Time at the Monte Carlo	We stayed at the Monte Carlo for four nights and enjoyed every minute of it! From the roomss to the staff everything was great. We did not encounter one person during our stay that was not friendly and helpful. We had a room on the 18th floor facing the strip and the construction from the City Center did not bother us at all. We did have the buffet for dinner one night and it was very nice, we also ate at Cafe and at the Brew Pub and did not have one bad meal. We will stay at this hotel again without a doubt,"
306,402,"Mar 9 2009 	Nothing Fancy But Good For The Price / 3.5 out of 5	In reading recent reviews I made sure to ask for a room not located facing all the construction and trust me you will want to do this to as the rooms are defintley not sound proof as we could hear the construction Thursday and Friday morning . We also could hear the sounds of the strip coming into the room as well such as the music from Diablo's bar downstairs on their patio and the people screaming on the Roller Coaster at New York New York.Overall though the room was very clean , nicely sized, big bathroom and friendly staff and service. Check in and check out were both very quick and efficent and the location on the strip is nice, not central but not total opposite end.If you get a good deal and really don't care about a themed looked to your hotel like say Luxor , then The Monte Carlo is not a bad option at all but next time I think I'll look for a fancier hotel. Just a personal preference ."
307,402,"Mar 6 2009 	Not perfect but great value	My wife and I booked a trip to vegas from columbus ohio for 3 nights at the monte carlo. The price was incredible compared to other hotels in the same location, we got air and 3 nights for less than $700. I read the reviews and knew what to expect-construction next door, thin walls etc. We actually loved it and thought above all the place was CLEAN. don't listen to what you hear about people saying it is not kept up well, just not true. For this price, you have to be willing to put up with the imperfections and enjoy yourself. We didn't do any expensive meals, but the fee buffet was fine and the cafe was really very good for the money any time of day."
308,402,"Mar 4 2009 	Great value!	Took advantage of the email rate and we were comped 3 of the 4 nights we stayed. Room was large with large bathroom. Very clean with good maid service. Check-in was quick and the lady checking us in was extremely helpful. Despite comments to the contrary, we found this place quiet (much more so than the Mirage). Machines were tight, but the casino is large and easy to get around. Will not eat at the Cafe again. We went for a late lunch and I ordered a simple salad and my wife ordered a sandwich. It took nearly 45 minutes, despite the fact few people were there. No apology even after asking the waitress where our food was. Food was no better than a salad at McDonalds. We needed a cab to get our rental car. bellhop said that this was a new cabbie, but he told him to just drive down Las Vegas Blvd. the the Fox car rental. When he turned right onto Tropicana Blvd, I asked why. he said that the freeway was quicker. Since it was 9 a.m. and the was no traffic, and only 3 traffic lights to go through, I questioned why. Well after getting off the freeway, he drove right past the rental place and then wanted to drive even further to turn around. He then drove us up to the entrance and expected us to get out and walk across the parking lot to the office. His credentials were not displayed on the dash as required. We were WAY overcharged. This was the trip from hell! The Monte Carlo should not be dealing with thiefs like this. I would absolutely stay at the Monte Carlo again, but would refuse to take another cabbie who is new. Incidentally, this was the only Mid-eastern cabbie we met out of about 6 cab rides."
309,402,"Mar 3 2009 	What a waste of money	I was very disappointed with the Monte Carlo. We were told it was a four star...far from it. The reason we chose it was because of the pool, but the pool was closed and they didn't tell you unless you asked. They informed us we could use the Bellagio (which they made seem like it's right next door) but it's over half a mile away. The walls were sooo shallow, we heard people's TV's above us, below us, and next to us plus everyone in the halls. The beds were uncomfortable, shower head very low, and the handle to the sink came off when I put it on!"
310,402,"Mar 3 2009 	Fun Hotel with One Exception	I stayed at the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino on March 2, 2009, with my wife, my brother and his wife. We were in town to see The Beatles Love at the Mirage. Overall I would give the Monte Carlo very positive reviews. I like the Monte Carlo because the casino is fairly small by strip standards and not so hard to find people or lengthy walks to get places. The casino was very nice, clean and very good drink service. The rooms were nice and clean. Diablos Cantina was a lot of fun during Happy Hour with crazy drink specials with the female bartender pouring wild shots while standing on the bar. My only complaint involved an incident at the Cafe and involves something that would have never happened in Vegas 15 years ago before the whole town went corporate. After we returned from the show at the Mirage we went for a quick bite to eat the Cafe before going to bed. While we were in the process of being seated the hostess had a fight with three servers right in front of our table over who was going to be our server. We waited for about 10 minutes and no one even brought water to our table or took our drink orders. If the cafe had been busy I would have understood, but it was close to 90% empty. I called over the hostess to ask if there was a problem and she said someone would be with us shortly. We waited a few more minutes and still no one came to our table to even bring us water, let along take our food order. I then complained rather sternly to the manager about what the problem was with the service. She informed me that if I did not calm down she was going to call security and have me removed. This despite the fact that we had been waiting for 15 minutes with no assurance we would get water let alone dinner. I told her this level of service was not acceptable and she told me that she would not speak to me until I calmed down. I saved her the trouble and our party just left the cafe. 15 years ago that would never have happened in Vegas and is now one of the reasons I go to Laughlin now rather than Vegas. 15 years ago that manager would have go to the kitchen themselves to get the water and probably comped our meals. But in these modern times where these corporate casinos have to squeeze every dime out of every possible source of cash in the hotels customer service has to take a hit. So instead of taking care of us, the manager was complete rude and disrepectful to me and probably cost her resturant $100 that night. In the grand scheme of things that doesn't matter to the Monte Carlo, but it demonstrates how much Las Vegas has changed and not for the better."
311,402,"Mar 3 2009 	Much better than expected	We stayed here for the Valentine's weekend. It was much better than expected after reading some of these reviews and we would stay here again forsure! We got the deal from Westjet with 2 free buffets (AMAZING!), 2 drinks and 2 spa passes. We only used the buffet. We also got $10 slot money with the package on top of the $10 for signing up for the MGM card. (The casinos in Old Vegas only give free cards or entry forms for signing up.) The fast food places were ok, but a little expensive. The room was very nice (especially compared to Stratosphere), the service was great, and the casino had very loose slots. It was the only casino I won in. I also won the free trip to Cancun that the casino in Old Vegas draws each night, but the trip was not free. It would cost over $300 in taxes and fees. We asked for a room away from the construction and we got a room on the 27th floor. We did not hear a thing, and the beds were very comfy. We saw the V-Show after getting a cheap ticket from a timeshare promo. It was good for $10 but not worth a full price ticket. If you are going to see a show, but the tix for half price on the street. Just get in line early in the morning. We also went fishing in Lake Mead with a guide and it was AMAZING! We caught 23 fish in 5 hours. It is only 30min away from the strip. The wax museum was ok, but not really worth the price of the ticket and the aquarium at Mandalay Bay was not cheap but very good.We will definately stay at the Monte Carlo again. Our stay was great! Thanks!!"
312,402,"Mar 2 2009 	Nice but could be noisy	3 Night stay at a great price.Asked for a room away from construction which they obliged by putting us away from the major City Centre construction.However we still heard construction early from building works near New York New York so ask for a high room.Room was fine,beds comfortable but the walls are very thin and if you have a neighbour with a noisy child like us and you have jet lag it can be a problem.Loved the Brew Pub downstairs- nice atmosphere and good cheap specials.Casino had a nice atmosphere.Diablo restaurant out front was a little like a conveyor belt with the staff constantly rushing you through to serve the next eaters.The construction work next door also hinders walking up and down the strip as the sidewalk was closed at times causing much crossing over the busy road and extra steps.Also what is it with the people giving out the porn cards on the street .All in I would stay again but would probably wait a while until the construction is finished."
313,402,Mar 1 2009	Great location low-key hotel in middle of action	The Monte Carlo is a great value in a great location. It is safe and clean with nice amenities. It is not as &quot;over-the-top&quot; decor-wise as other Vegas properties. The pool is lovely and suitable for both adults and children. The restaurants provide quality foods appealing to a variety of tastes. The casino is bright and cheerful with a nice range of slots and tables.
314,402,"Feb 28 2009 	Hotel Going Down Hill	Third visit to Monte Carlo in 3 years.25th Floor view of Strip.

Cons:+ Paper thin walls offering loud, various sounds from neighboring rooms and noisy water pipes.+ Dried blood stain on linen + Smell of cigarette smoke in room was strong.

315,402,"Feb 28 2009 	Spa Suite Worth the Upgrade	My husband and I traveled to Vegas recently for a few days away. Upon our arrival we were booked in a standard room. We had requested a King but none were available so we ended up with two double beds. At that time we also upgraded to a Spa Suite for the next two nights. The upgrade was given at a very reasonable price. It was well worth it. The suite was located on the 21st floor. It had a two person jackuzi in the room that was right by the window and overlooking the strip. The bathroom was very large as well. The only negative was we requested a late check-out and was not granted this request although we were told it wouldn't be a problem at check-in. The location of the Monte Carlo is good. It was a little farther down that we would have liked, but still within walking distant to almost everything."
316,402,"Feb 27 2009 	Great deal	Spent 2 days of rest and relaxation at the MC. Got a great special that included drinks, fitness center, and buffet all included. Room was fine nothing special. I will say that construction starts early in the morning. Really wasn't that bad I had asked a room away from the construction. I will say that I did have a good time in the casino, the cocktail remember my drink each night which is like old Vegas! Table games were not over priced even on Friday night, played Let it Ride for $5. Check out was great no wait did via TV. I would highly suggest the MC for a quick stay!"
317,402,"Feb 27 2009 	Eh - average	Stayed at the MC because rooms were comped. I would not stay otherwise. The bedding was flimsy (no comforter, just a thin scratchy blanket with some sheets (like a motel). This is my main gripe. I really like their casino (not too big, not too small), but their rooms are really not up to par with other places.I'll probably stay at other hotels in the future."
318,402,"Feb 26 2009 	Decent hotel but north end of strip is much nicer	We hadn't been to Vegas in 5 years. Went to see what was new &amp; exciting. Truth is - not much. Chose the Monte Carlo because they were offering a good Winter Special - decent weekend room rate and a few perks - free buffet, drinks at el Diablo and some other incentives. The hotel was fine - nothing special - but the construction going on around it (the Aria) was ridiculous. Trucks and banging starting at 4 a.m. Noisy!! No TV remote in our room and ill-fitting sheets, hard pillows, soft mattresses. Decent food court with a Starbucks, but the smell of smoke makes it impossible to sit and eat. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet - great selection. Worst part - their location at the south end of the strip is a dump. Vendors on every street corner and people handing out what literally is porn - cards with naked women advertising strip clubs all over the city. Glad we left the kids at home! If you're going to Vegas, stay at the Bellagio or anywhere north of it. The Wynn looked lovely."
319,402,"Feb 25 2009 	marvellous hotel	After reading some of the revues on this hotel,we were a bit concerned. But on arrival the staff were marvellous, the reception was really nice.The check in was very quick, before we knew it we were on our way to our rooms. We were on the 24th floor with views over the Strip.The rooms were quite big and nice and clean.The hotel was very central, plenty of places to eat.Lovely casino and shops. Couldn't ask for anything else.The only downfall was the building work going on next door,it didn't bother us but we found the hotel staff worked really hard to keep the place clean.Would definately stay at this hotel again.The only thing is the City Centre that they are building next door hides a lot of the view of the Strip, it is a shame really as it is a lovely hotel,but how long do you stay in your rooms in Vegas."
320,402,"Feb 25 2009 	Great time!	Went for a long weekend and had a wonderful time. Great rates and location. Right next to New York New York, so was able to go to the Irish pub and have a great time!"
321,402,"Feb 20 2009 	Great Comps	We spent a long Valentine's weekend and were very happy with the hotel and it's services. Checked in around noon and got a room immediately. Room was clean and bed comfortable. I am a smoker and did find there wasn't much ventilation to get rid of the smoke. Window opened about 6&quot; but that didn't help much and no exhaust fan in the bathroom. Also thought the bedspreads and carpet were outdated but I didn't expect (or pay the price of) the Wynn. We had a corner room and could still hear hall noise but never heard any construction noise. Shower was amazing. The location is convenient with MGM and New York, New York within close walking distance. Also nice to have Walgreen's and CVS within a block for those forgotten items. Food at the Cafe and the Buffet were both very good. We found casino staff to be very friendly and comps from their Players Club were amazing. All of our food charges were comped ($150+) which was a surprise since we are not big gamblers. We will definitely stay at Monte Carlo again."
322,402,"Feb 16 2009 	Perfect Getaway	My boyfriend and I stayed at the MC for the long weekend and we enjoyed it. Check in was a breeze and they gave us a room on a high floor. Not too many people checking in earlier in the afternoon was nice. The room was nice, it was a room with a connecting door but we hardly noticed. Only on one of the three nights we were there did we hear neighbors. View out the windows wasn't the greatest- it was on the construction, but we saw gorgeous sunsets all three nights. No fitted sheets on the beds, but I think that is common in most hotels on the strip. Location was perfect, we walked everywhere we went, never even thought to use the car. Casino didn't have as much traffic as the others so that was nice. Buffet brunch in the morning was great, had a lot of food and great selections. Free margaritas at Diablo's were welcomed and tasty, but when we wanted to eat at 10:30pm on a Sunday night, there kitchen was already closed so we had to go next door to the NYNY. No complaints about the room or anything like that, it was a great location, price, and room for the romantic getaway we were looking for!"
323,402,"Feb 16 2009 	Monte Carlo Just Fine (if you aren't picky and expecting the Wynn or Bellagio)	We (boyfriend &amp; I) stayed at the Monte Carlo Feb 12-15th for a Valentine's getaway. Check-in was quick, we asked to be located away from the construction going on next door and they happily obliged. The room was standard and fine for us - clean and nice enough. Noise - We did hear construction the first night (a few bangs like they were moving steel) at about 4 am so it probably was very loud if you were on the construction side of the hotel but that was all we heard in 3 nights. We heard our neighbors once but then they were either quiet or never in their room...if you had noisy ones I suppose that could have been a problem but we were lucky. Casino - The casino is a little smokier than others but also a little quieter which was okay with me (we just went to the other hotels... we don't gamble much, maybe 2 hours total the whole trip).Food - We ate at the food court for breakfast the first morning and it was standard Starbucks (yes the prices are a little higher but what do you expect, if you want the cheaper prices you have to leave the hotel and go across the street to that food court - we were willing to pay a couple bucks more for the convenience). The second morning we went to the cafe...the &quot;Ultimate Oatmeal&quot; is good and huge enough for 2 people to easily share (maybe even 3 people) so we both ate for under $12. We had a free buffet and used it for dinner...not impressed with that. The food wasn't BAD but it also wasn't great or exciting (kind of like a college cafeteria level of food instead of a resort buffet level). If you had to pay for it, it wouldn't be worth it...go elsewhere. The pool was closed until March but they told us we can go next door to the Bellagio and use their pool/hot tub (for free). Check out was easy. Housekeeping was nice and I thought they did a fine job. Location is excellent (I was bummed that the tram to the Bellagio is gone because now you have to walk past all the construction to get there but it's still a good location) . Don't expect the Mirage, Bellagio or Wynn - type luxury here, I certainly wouldn't call it Motel 6...it's more a Holiday Inn/Doubletree level hotel. We thought it was a reasonable price, in a good location and a decent hotel."
324,402,"Feb 16 2009 	This place is a dump!!!!!!!!	Sink clogged, wallpaper falling off, bathroom filthy, floors dirty, Sheets dirty. What more can I say. This place sucks now. I stayed here a few years ago and it was ok. Now its way worse that a $39 old town hotel."
325,402,Feb 15 2009 	Dirty Room	First day at the hotel - had to asked for the sheets to be change - sheets was dirty. The wornout mattress - was very uncomfortable to sleep on. Had to asked for the floors to be clean. Deluxe Double Rooms &amp; bath is a standard Motel 6 decor. I felt the rooms was overpriced because no extravagant decors - standard 2 star hotel decor.
326,402,Feb 14 2009 	Great Location - Low end hotel	The Montecarlo is in a great location but the hotel is so-so. Beds do not have fitted sheets so you end up sleeping directly on the mattress which is not really hygienic.
327,402,"Feb 14 2009 	It was fine for the very discounted rate	We got a &quot;Monaco Suite&quot; package for only $89 per night and we got our money's worth, but I wouldn't pay over $100.00 for the suite.Check-in was rather slow. I counted 15 people in line and only 2 stations open. No indication of where to line up, everyone just sort of bunches up and tries to figure it out.The room was HUGE, and had 2 bathrooms. The very small closet was as far from the main bathroom as it could be. There was a jetted tub that had a shower head above it, but not so much as a single grab bar to hold as I crawled in and out over the high sides of the tub. And I am not short. Huge toilet closet which was a waste of space and easily could have accomodated a shower.Soap dish was not cleaned out while we were there. The first day our towels smelled very scorched, but the 2nd day were replaced with better smelling ones. Toiletries were simple and nice.Old bananas in the refrigerator and a call to housekeeping resulted in only an empty promise to remove them. We tossed them out into the hallway 7 hours after calling (didn't want to stink up our room) when we wanted to use the fridge and someone did manage to pick them up by morning.The bed was comfortable and the construction noise did not bother us at all, but we are very sound sleepers. We did hear the phone ringing next door a few times.Internet service is wired only and costs $15 per day. Very strange, but the connection is by the television and quite far away from the desk. No informational magazines anywhere to be found in the room. That was a first for Vegas.The casino was nice, the dealers were great, but we could not get water from the waitresses. Food at the buffet was very good. Diablos was a fun place and the food above average. The free margarita was &quot;ok&quot; but hey, it was free.I'd stay there again if it was cheap. Location is good, it was easy to walk everywhere we wanted to go and CVS pharmacy is right outside for anything forgotten."
328,402,"Feb 11 2009 	Nice Time at the Monte Carlo!	Stayed at the Monte Carlo from Feb 6 to Feb 10, 2009. Nothing but praise for the hotel staff who seem to go out of there way to greet you and make sure everything is okay. Before we left home we asked our rep at WestJet vacations to put a note on our file requesting an upper level room away from the construction next door and we got just that - room 30310 with a lovely view of mountains. Make sure you are not on the construction side of the hotel or you WILL be disturbed by the noise.Our room was a nice size, clean and the maid accomodating - asked for a feather pillow and got it right away - our towels were fluffy and clean and plentiful - the bathroom spotless.Tried the buffet for breakfast and dinner - really good quality food - execellent service - chefs and wait staff very friendly.Casino area smells nice and they try to eliminate the smoke - better than a lot of the other casinos. The music was loud at times in some areas. Waitresses always nearby and happy to serve you. Had some good luck on the Monopoly game and then some bad luck....&lt;smile&gt;.The food court offers some of your favourites, Subway, Starbucks, McDonalds, Sbarro, etc. but for value - you can't beat the buffet.Yes, the Monte Carlo is dated, and there is noisy construction zone next door, but for sheer value you can't beat it. So don't be afraid to give the old girl a try.(Be advised that the Lance Burton Magic show and the Micro Brewery Pub are both closed on Sundays and Mondays.)"
329,402,"Feb 10 2009 	Wonderful stay at the Monte Carlo	I took my husband to Las Vegas for his 40th Birthday. Since it was his first time to Vegas (my 3rd visit to Vegas, but never stayed at the Monte Carlo) I wanted everything to be perfect. I was very worried after reading the reviews and I had already booked and payed for our stay (with not enough time to change our accommodations). We stayed at the Monte Carlo Feb. 5th-9th 2009 in room 9103 and everything was wonderful! We did ask for a room away from the construction going on next to the MC. The rooms are simple and very clean. No coffee in the room, but there is a Starbucks in the MC. The food court in the MC is very convenient for breakfast, lunch on the go, or late night snack . Checking in and out was fast. The location is great. All of the staff were very nice and never rude. We enjoyed our stay so much at the MC, we will be returning this summer."
330,402,"Feb 4 2009 	very nice hotel	I am staying at the monte carlo as we speak and I am quite pleased. My only advise would be to ask for a room on the south side to avoid the construction noise. There is a large hotel going up right next door. There was still some residual noise and the only way to avoid it would be to stay at the luxor or Mandalay Bay which are much further south. Nice clean hotel though, no complaints..."
331,402,"Feb 3 2009 	Exceeded My Expectations	Due to numerous negative posts about the Monte Carlo I had set my expectations fairly low. However, I was very pleasantly surprised at my stay. The check-in was quick, friendly and accurate, and all the perks of the package I reserved were noted and offered.The room was very, very nice and the bathroom was roomy. Everything was clean and fresh in appearance and smell. The housekeeping staff restocked and refreshed the room very well each day.Yes, there is construction next door and they do work 24 hours a day. But I was never bothered by any noise whatsoever. Occassional banging or a horn were insignificant and would never prevent me from sleeping comfortably. I've got to assume it was more quiet and less bright than the flash of the Strip, had my room faced that direction.I will admit the walls are very thin and a noisy neighbor &quot;could&quot; be a problem very easily. I was fortunate that my neighbors were quiet so no problem there.The food was good at the restaurants and buffet, and even the food court would be great for someone who just wants to spend a couple bucks on food or a soda (even the McDonalds had a few items for $1).Didn't do terribly well on the slots at Monte Carlo, compared to other casinos, but that's Lady Luck, not the establishment so much.Checkout was efficient and accurate.All in all, I would definitely stay at Monte Carlo again. Previous negative reports are helpful but remember that some people only see the bad side of everything. There is definitely very little &quot;bad&quot; about the Monte Carlo so don't be afraid at all."
1,404,Nov 5 2008 	Drug needles under the bed!!!!!!!!	This motel is absolutely terrible. There was a Drug syringe left under the bed and all they could say about that was that it was a &quot;budget&quot; motel what did we expect?. We switched rooms and the new room had a dirty toilet. All this and they charge you extra for WIFI Bad customer service and no cleanliness makes this one of the worst rooms we've ever had the misfortune to visit. Avoid at all costs. (seriously stay in your car if you have to).
2,404,"Mar 26 2007 	This place stinks - literally!!!	We requested a non-smoking room. What a joke, the room was labeled non-smoking, there were ash trays in it and it stank so badly I had a raw throat and stuffy nose by early morning. If there had been another choice I would gladly have paid for another room elsewhere. It was filthy. The lady in the office was very pleasant and helpful but I didn't complain about the room so I don't know if complaining would have changed her attitude or not. I would definitely never stay there again nor would I recommend this place to my worst enemy."
3,404,"Feb 7 2007 	Rather Sleep In A Cardboard Box	My wife and I were going to stay here for the night, on our way to my brother's house. It took the rude woman at the desk several minutes to notice us, and looked like she had NO IDEA WHATSOEVER what she was doing. We got to our room, and it felt, sounded, and smelled like a thousand rats were living in the walls and floor. The sheets were stained with bodily waste and cigarette burns, and whether you believe me or not, I even found a pistol under the bed. VERY SEEDY! Due to the horrible state of the bed, (bedbugs and loose springs), I was up until midnight, so I looked out the window, and while I am not sure, I could have sworn I saw people making drug deals in the parking lot! Like I said, VERY SEEDY. Give it a miss."
4,404,"Aug 20 2006	Yuck! Double Yuck!	If you like feeling like you're sleeping in an ashtray (in what was supposed to be a non-smoking room), being bitten by bed bugs, and wondering if you're going to wake up with your belongings and self unharmed, then this is the place for you, otherwise, stay clear. BY FAR THE WORST HOTEL/MOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED IN! My husband says we would have been better off sleeping in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd. than this joint."
5,404,"Jun 1 2006	The WORST place you may ever stay.	The Motel 6 on Boulder Hwy. in Las vegas, NV is absolutely horrible!I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. It was filthy... the bed sheats did not appear to be clean, they had stains and cigarette burns in them. The showers had mold in them.The building was run-down and looked like the 2nd floor was about to colapse to the ground. The staff is exceptionally rude, I found a bug in the bed which I am assuming was a BED BUG and the staff member on duty did not offer an apology or even a solution--nothing, except for an attitude.Most of the people occupying rooms were suspicious and loud at all times of the night.DO NOT GO TO MOTEL 6It is definitely worth the extra cash to stay in a higher end hotel and I don't recommend going unless you can. Because the low-end experience of Vegas is no way to go and Vegas' low is extremely low in comparison to other cities."
6,404,"Apr 20 2004	Flea pit!!!!	As a UK visitor I can easily say - quite simply the worst hotel - rooms, staff even 'free' coffee and donuts - all absolutley awful. We had the misfortune to be staying during NASCAR, so all Vegas hotels were $200 plus. We paid $90 for a 'kitchenette' - it stank, it was filthy, unsecure (dodgy locks) and the staff couldn't be bothered, they just said it was due to NASCAR! It was our last night and really left a bad taste (and smell) DON'T USE THIS PLACE, their pricing policy stinks as much as the rooms!!"
1,407,Great Stay at Ny NY	From check in to check out we had a fab time at Ny Ny - the location is not as central as some of the hotels we've stayed at but we new this before we booked. We had a great room (newly refurbished) on a relatively low floor but the view was unimportant and the casino and bars were all great fun. There is a lovely little coffee shop which we used for bagel and coffees for breakfast just round past starbucks and the piano bar. The place is buzzing 24hours and we know as we didn't sleep the 4 days of our visit.
2,407,"Great casino with great people - but don't stay at the hotel	I arrived Thanksgiving day from San Diego, needed a family getaway (or should I say get away from family :-) I booked on priceline and put in $90 for a four star or better hotel, so I didn't have a lot of choice on which hotel, when the price came back as NY NY. I had read the previous reviews online, but wanted to come here with an open mind, prepare for the worst and hope for the best! Arriving at the hotel, the front desk was extremely nice. There wasn't a long line and it was relatively painless. Because I had read previous reviews on the rooms, I opted to upgrade to a nicer room for only $10 per night which was said to be remodeled. When I entered the room, I was like, there is no way this is a 4star hotel and thank goodness I upgraded. However, the room was very noisy, every thirty seconds I thought I was hearing the roller coaster. Imagine hearing the coaster at Space Mountain pulling in, that is the exact sound. So I called down to the front desk and asked them what time the roller coaster stops running and they told me at 11pm. So I was fine with it because I wasn't planning on being in the room during the day, just wanted to make sure I would be able to sleep. However, while I was on the phone, my bags arrived from the bellman and he informed me that was not the roller coaster I was hearing, it was the elevator shaft. So I asked to be moved. They were very accomodating. The room I am not in (at this very moment as I write this). The room is quieter, but you can still hear the elevator shaft. In speaking with people that work at the hotel, they tell me they wouldn't stay in one of the rooms either and &quot;what were they thinking when they designed the hotel and the rooms&quot;. As for the aestetecs (sp?), they did attempt to remodel or better stated, update the rooms. For a four star hotel on the Las Vegas strip - they missed the boat. With all the new hotels going up, getting completely revamped, I am afraid the NY NY rooms look and feel about as old as the Statue of Liberty. Popcorn ceilings, parquet paneled armoire (really, who would have thought?) and hideous bedspreads that look very worn.Sorry for the long write-up on the room, just want to let you know what to expect if you do stay here. If you can live with the forementioned, you will be in good shape.The staff is very very friendly throughout the hotel, casino and restaurants. Absolutely would recommend gambling hear if you want to play craps or blackjack. The table limits in the morning are $5 and by 11am move to $10, depending on how busy they are. Compared to many of the other 4 star hotels, this is great if you want to play low limits. The other hotel minimums I experienced were $15 and not as friendly. Huge shout out to Calvin at the Craps table, he never missed a bet and chatted everyone up.The nightclub is ok, no line. I think this is more an indication of the economy and the location. The club at the Encore is the hot spot in Vegas at this time. And the NY NY hotel is at the end of the strip, down by Excalibur, which is not an ideal location for me.And, I can't forget, LOVE LOVE LOVE the Dueling Piano Bar. Went there all three nights and always had fun! Always met fun people and really enjoyed the variety of music.BTW- I'm not a huge roller coaster fan, but got talked into going on it. It is SOOOOO much fun. However, everyone in lined agreed that it wasn't worth the $14 per person. Which if you are traveling with a family, can add up quickly.In summary, recommend coming down to NyNy for a little gambling and the Dueling Piano bars. But, with so many GREAT deals on the strip, stay at another hotel if you want a peaceful night sleep."
3,407,"Great place to stay.	Nice location on the strip, many nearby attractions. Hotel was clean, nicely decorated, and had many things to do."
4,407,"Great location okay price no in-room coffee maker	We stayed at NYNY, Las Vegas on Halloween and 3 nights following. We were very excited to be on the 25th floor and the view did not diappoint. The room itself was clean and very modern, however the beds were very uncomfortable.The air conditing and heat were very quick to adjust to your comfort level but the worst part of the room and probabaly the only reason I will not stay here when I return to Vegas is there was no in room coffee maker. I called to request one and was told they were not available. (of course I could have purchased a pot of coffee through room service for $9 plus a $3 service fee). Pool and hot tub area was clean as was the entire casino. Lots of amenities on site and the italian restaurant in the hotel was excellent!!"
5,407,"Nov 21 2009 	An OK hotel at a good price	We stayed at NY, NY as part of a package deal with Allegiant Air. For the price we paid, it was a satisfactory place to stay. Check-in was quick and friendly at 2 pm on a Sunday. Our first room was on the 7th floor and the rollercoaster plus other strange noises kept us awake. The next day we were moved to a room on the 26th floor with a great view of the mountains at no extra charge. It was very quiet and fairly spacious. Things I didn't like about this hotel included the extremely noisy lobby and the fact that there was no coffee maker in the room. Also, we were charged $3.00 per day for the telephone, even though we never used it. The restaurants were ok, but pricey. Fish and chops at the Irish pub was exorbitantly priced at $20-later found we could have had about the same meal from one of the small village restaurants for much less. We ate one breakfast and one dinner at the Italian restaurant and one dinner at the Mexican place and enjoyed them all. The location was a little farther south than I would have liked. If we return to Vegas, we would probably choose a slightly quieter place more towards the middle of the strip."
6,407,"Nov 19 2009 	Average we stayed there to take advantage of the 2 for $99 Zumanity coupon.	First-time visit to Vegas, so we didn't know what to expect other than the photo on the hotel site. We were in a 28th floor Park Avenue room that had lovely distant views of the mountains near the city. Being so high up gave us a grandiose view of the western part of Vegas and the roller coaster far below us. It also kept the city noises down.Check in was quick and friendly and the room was clean and roomy. Location on the strip is convenient.My beefs:No free wi-fi internet. Unacceptable.No coffee machine in the room. Unacceptable.Noise: poor sound insulation between the room and hallway. Unacceptable.Il Fornaio restaurant: We ate there twice, once at dinner and one breakfast. The dinner seafood pasta dish is so-so, bland and over priced. On the other hand, the granola in the breakfast menu was outstanding and made up for weak coffee. Service was very average and nowhere as good as the service we got on the second morning at the breakfast buffet at Chin-Chin. That really surprised me.Gambling: Way too smoky, if you're a non-smoker prepare to be inconvenienced by the smoke in the casino area in the mid-afternoons into the late night. Gross. *cough, cough*. Improved ventilation would be appreciated, or seperate smoking/non smoking areas. Better yet, make it non smoking all over. I actually gambled LESS because of the smoke. Hey, saved me some bucks!Would I stay there again? Probably not...we went there to save money on the Zumanity show (good fun, btw) with a 2 for $99 special. Next time, we'd go elsewhere."
7,407,"Nov 18 2009 	Fun Casino but don't stay at New York New York	This was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen in a luxury hotel. It's like a Microtel motel! What's worse is that we had an &quot;upgraded&quot; Park Avenue room (I even verified this with two people on the phone). Are there smaller rooms?? To be fair however, this is a hotel with a very unusual design because of the spectacular facade. I guess not all the rooms are like this. We had a king too so the rooms with two beds have to be larger. BUT MUCH WORSE: YOU CAN HEAR THE ROLLER COASTER IN YOUR ROOM! We were on the 14th fl but at regular intervals heard the coaster--really annoying. This is a fun casino but you might want to stay elsewhere."
8,407,"Nov 17 2009 	Would rather have been in New York City!!	yes it had all the glitz and somewhat glamour, but overall would rather have been on a sunny beach in the FRESH air!! Hotel was ok, smokey with the casino as all the hotels were we went thru, rooms were good but could hear the roller coaster which was very annoying, but at least it stopped at 11:00pm, however the airport noise was non-stop! Ate at three of the restaurants, all were expensive and food was fair.... &quot;the bar at times square&quot; was our highlight as the dualling pianos were excellent, very talented and alot of fun. Coyote Ugly definitley for the younger, ready to get drunk crowd, also very small inside!! Would I go back to this hotel? Only for the dualling pianos but probably won't go back to Vegas anyways! MGM &quot;Emirl's&quot; has excellent food, expensive but worth it!"
9,407,"Nov 17 2009 	annoying hotel which charges you for everything	I've stayed in Vegas a few times and stayed at the NYNY hotel before. I picked this hotel because it was the cheaper than many others and is conveniently located. The hotel is just the same as the big hotels on the strip. While it is okay it has some really annoying things which infuriated me. In fact, I was totally fed up with it to be honest. First, while there is free parking, to get to your room is an arduous task with suitcases. You park in the self park area; then you lug your cases out of your car; then you get the elevator to the walkway; then you walk the walkway; then you get the esculator; then you fight through the floor of slot machines and poker tables; then you get in line for check in; then you lug your cases back through the casino and get one of the elevators up to the floors of your room (anything from 20+; then you walk corridor after corridor to get to your room. Then you find there are no coffee making facilities; I am addicted to coffee; I find it outrageous that you can check into a Best Western motel and have microwaves; coffee machines; fridges etc and pay a reasonable rate yet in this much more expensive hotel you don't get a coffee maker forcing you to have to leave your room, back down the elevator; through the casino to one of the coffee shops for which a medium coffee can cost about $5 - ridiculous. i noticed that at Wallgreens across the strip they were selling coffee makers for $18 - if I would have found that the first day I would have just bought a coffee maker. Then, no free wi-fi. Instead you have to pay $15 for 24hours. Again, in comparison with Best Western this stinks. Hey, the hotel has a roller coaster which is great. But, $14 for one ride is simply outrageous. It's ridiculous. What makes it worse is that as a guest at the hotel you don't get any sort of discount for it. I hate the money grabbing 'trap' that you fall into when on the strip.I won't stay here again or, if I do, I'll make sure I get the best value by insisting on better facilities (and I'll get them)."
10,407,Nov 16 2009 	New York New York	The hotel is beautiful. We really enjoyed everything from the roller coaster to the dining...Gallagher's Steakhouse was incredible!! We would definitely stay at this hotel again.
11,407,"Nov 14 2009 	Didn't like the hidden resort fees.	When you register when first arriving at New York, New York, they make you sign a paper so they can charge you a $10.00 &quot;resort fee&quot;. What a rip off. When I tried to refuse it, they said all the other casinos are charging it. That still doesn't make it o.k. They also said it was mentioned on line where I booked..but it is hidden. They said the fee is for ammenities that would not otherwise be available. Why not give me that choice. It gives you a couple free drinks, a newspaper, 20% off ice cream, ability to print boarding pass, and maybe a couple other miner things. And the gambling machines are too tight."
12,407,Nov 14 2009 	Great hotel and even greater with a players club card!!!	I have been to Vegas many times and this time I took my wife. We checked in around midnight so check in was fast. They didn't have the room we requested at the time of check in but i called down in the morning and we were upgraded that afternoon to a room on the 21st floor. It faced the MGM and was great. We heard nothing at all even with the people next door living it up!! so I am not to sure what people are saying abou the thin walls. This was the 5th time I have stayed at the NYNY as with the players club card that give me great rates weekdays and weekends. The one thing I am dissapointed about is no buffett BUT a short walk over to the monte carlo and the buffett there is GREAT!!! I have stayed at many a hotel buy NYNY has earned my loyalty. The pool was not to bad but when we went down around 1-2 it was pretty busy but hey it is a 2-3000 room hotel so it was expected.
13,407,"Nov 13 2009 	New years day stay	Awesome hotel. Affordable. Really cool layut of shops, restaurants and casino"
14,407,"Nov 13 2009 	Great place to stay - forget the casino floor.	We came in for an overnight stay before continuing on to the next location on our trip.Pulled up into main entry and a bell person met us straight away and managed to pile all our bags on his cart. Check in was easy and then we grabbed a bite to eat and headed out for the night tour of the strip and Fremont Street. We booked a couples package here (on promotion at the time of the trip) and got quite a few things at 2 for 1 in a coupon book. We had breakfast at Il Fornaio restaurant. Great place to eat first thing in the morning!!! Retail area is kind of the same ole same ole. It is also very dark in the lobby area which takes away from the uniqueness of the look of the lobby.Room was nice, we got the Park Avenue Deluxe room as part of the upgrade. Bell service was very helpful in all their duties. Baggage delivery was very prompt even at 11pm at night. The one bellman in the morning helped us weigh or bags at the business center and then get them out to the bus shuttle stop location. Drapes really block out the light and the noise from the street and airport.Forget using the PC's there as they are really expensive. You are charged $3 for the phone connection even if you don't use it. Internet access is extra on top of that.Book this hotel direct and not via priceline if you want to get some good deals."
15,407,"Nov 12 2009 	great hotel- nice experience	the new york,new york is very nice - the registration woman was very pleasant - there was no wait ( we arrived on a Tuesday at 2p)--we had reserved a basic room and when we arrived we upgraded for $10/night extra - we had a view of the main street/the room was nice /very clean - big bathroom- we were very pleased with it --will definitely stay here again-----we ate at the Irish Pub downstairs one nite - food was very good-----and if you get a chance to see the Jersey Boys ,it is a great show"
16,407,"Nov 12 2009 	Fantastic hotel for the younger crowd	Stayed here for a week at the end of June (24th-01st July) with my girlfriend. it was my 4th trip to vegas and her first so wanted to make sure she had a hotel that would be a great base and with alright location.The room was thouroughly cleaned daily, and was a good size. we stayed in a park avenue deluxe room and had a view of MGM grand, the rollercoaster, and Tropicana. We were on the 17th floor and rarely struggled to get an elevator/lift quickly. Another nice thing about the room was the Bose Ipod dock. would have liked a flat screen TV but not really fussed since we spent very little time in there. It's true the decor could be better but its hardly outdated/run down. Bed was comfy and never noticed noise coming from any of the rooms near us (contrary to peoples comments about thing walls). Shower pressure was great. Other thing to note on the room was that we never heard the lift or rollercoaster - probably because we were on such a high floor and at the opposite end of the hotel to the lifts so not really in a position to comment on peoples complaints about them.Check in was very fast (wednesday afternoon at 2pm) and the woman was very helpful and friendly. The staff in general in the hotel were excellent and more than willing to help you out if you need anythingthe casino was great and a nice way to finish the night off after a night out. the slots were fairly generous (i won $150 of a $1 bet!). the cocktail waitresses come round very often ifyou tip them a dollar a drink and even faster if you tip more (generally i tipped $5 for two drinks). me and my partner are by no means high rollers but we did get a $75 room service bill comped from the players club even though we didnt really gamble much money. You can spend hours in the casino on $20 drinking as much as you like. the trick for us was to stick to the low end slots and bet minumum. we never expected to win anything so to walk away with more than you put in was always an unexpected (and very welcome) bonus.mixed feelings about the poor. on the good side it has an atmosphere, good bar, nice jacuzzi, and lots of sun loungers. on the down side, it doesnt get any sun till about 11 and by which time it gets very busy. also the music they play is a bit repetitve. overall i liked it because i was able to plug in the Ipod, sip on a cocktail, close my eyes, and recover from the constant hangovers in peace.Food at the hotel is a mixed bag too. the steak house (gallaghers) is truly excellent and good value. never ate at ESPN as its not my kinda place. the village eateries are great too - especially the Deli and the 50's style diner burger place (near the rollercoaster) and they are a cheap and easy quick fill if you dont want to bother with a restaurant. I must be the only person who thought the pizza place was overrated since it always had a huge queue. also, avoid the buffet place in the morning as it just reminded me of left over chinese food.Nightlife at the hotel is among the best in Vegas. Cayotes is great, and Nine Fine Irishmen is my favourate bar in Vegas.The live band they have there are very entertaining (listen out for them playing 'seven drunken nights', or find the clips on youtube). didnt bother with the bar at times square so cant offer an opinion on that, and the same applies for Rok nightclub. the 24 hour bar overlooking the casino has a great view but watch out for the drinks prices!Overall, i love this hotel. it always has an atmosphere and its perfect for younger couples, lads, and girls holidays. if you want a quiet place in vegas, stay elsewhere as this place is full of life. the location isnt great but its opposite MGM grand which has a monorail stop for easy access to the rest of the strip."
17,407,"Nov 10 2009 	Themed Hotel right in the action in Las Vegas	I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the years and it is a great base for exploring the Las Vegas strip. If you go between Sunday - Thursday you can get some great deals (keep away from the weekend when the Angilinos arrive!!). I paid about $60/night for a strip view room Sunday to Thursday inc. The hotel is much like all the othe Strip hotels, excellent facilities but a bit clinical, although the check in girl was very pleasant. No breakfast included, the hotel restaurants are a bit expensive, but we ate at either Einstiens Bagels, or Denny's over the road.Rooms are a good size and very clean. The hotel is situated right on the best part of the Strip, so a good location."
18,407,"Nov 8 2009 	Nice hotel average pool	We stayed for four nights in a skyline room. The hotel is huge and the room was nice and clean. We didn't like the pool, however, because there is only limited shadow (almost no sun anymore after 4pm) and the pool closes at 6pm. So if spending time at the pool is an important part of your stay, don't stay here! Furthermore the casino, restaurants and hotel are good! The hotel provides free parking in their own garage."
19,407,"Nov 7 2009 	Amazing value on the Strip	Some friends recommended NY NY as being a good hotel on the Strip, and this certainly rang true for us. On researching for a hotel to stay at in Vegas we wanted something comfortable in a good location so we could see as much of Vegas as possible in the short 2 night stopover we had. We booked on their own website and discovered that their &quot;Couples Package&quot; was the same price as their cheapest room (Skyline I think), but included a free upgrade to a Strip View room, 2 free drinks, 2 for 1 breakfasts at one of the cafes, 2 for 1 rollercoaster voucher (which is a pretty good rollercoaster that goes around the hotel and costs $14 per person normally), $25 retail credit to use and a 2 for 1 Spa voucher (that we didn't get time to use). It also promoted a cheap price on a tour of Vegas sights but we didn't really see the need and it is definitely not essential to use to get this deal.Looking at the map the hotel may appear to be at one end and thus away from the most concentrated spots on the Strip, but we found it was definitely close enough to be in walking distance of most attractions.On check-in the guy was great - he was very polite and professional, went through each of the vouchers we had included and how we were to use them, and gave us detailed directions on how to get to our hotel room which was essential with 4 towers and slot machines everywhere blocking any signs they may have. A great first impression.Whilst it may not be the flashiest of hotels in Vegas the rooms are fine as are the casino, bars and dining. When you consider it was half the price of most other hotels around NY NY is definitely worth considering next time you go to Vegas."
20,407,"Nov 5 2009 	Right on the strip nice big rooms	Good hotel right on the strip, everything you could wish for on your doorstep, all the hotels are massive and this is no exception. I suppose this one has the added benefit of having a roller coaster running through and around it (on in vegas eh), Personal highlights for me was the pool with its bar serving alcoholic slushes, be prepared for brain freeze....oh and another thing, if youre going to get married in vegas, do it for the right reasons!, this review might have been better if it wasnt for the fact Vegas holds some strange memories for me!!!"
21,407,"Nov 4 2009 	Breathe Oxygen Bar a Scam	Please beware of the oxygen bars in Vegas, they really are only trying to sell you a massager that they will not return your money on if you try to take it back even the same day! I was not told of the return policy until I purchased the unit then they said no returns and they don't even sell anything else to get with store credit. You will be stuck witt a stupid little hand held massager that does not work!"
22,407,"Oct 30 2009 	Loved this hotel-one of the easiest to navigate on the strip	We had a short 2 night stay which usually isn't long enough to even find your way around the mega hotels on the strip but New York, New York was designed in a way that all of the room elevators were in the casino so you weren't winding down long, unending hallways to find the casino like others have been. All of staff was very nice and helpful. Machines were a little tight but it seemed to be like that all over the strip. It was obvious that the economy has affected the hotels on the strip. Not nearly as much traffic as usual and almost every hotel had a broken escalator. Room was very comfortable and spacious. TV lineup was a little short but who goes to Vegas to watch TV anyway??HIghly recommend the Zumanity show! I made my reservations online with a buy one, get the next for $25 and thought that was a great deal but hotel guests get 2 for $99 so before ordering tickets to any show, I would call hotels directly to see if there might be a better rate. I asked them for difference but they said I had already purchased them at a discount so they wouldn't do anything- it was only about $15 difference but still a little annoying."
23,407,Oct 27 2009 	I had an awesome time! :)	My stay at this hotel was awesome!! Great hotel to stay and play! The room was average but the bathroom and most important the VIEW made of for it! Our view faced the MGM. Surrounded by other hotels and lots of billboards which reminded me of times square in NYC! The staff was great and very accomodating. The casino was fun and the machines were kind to me and my girlfriends :) The restaurants were good eateries depending on preference. The location was also great and convenient to all casinos on the strip. All in all NY NY was a great choice made and will definitely stay again and highly recommend it to all!
24,407,"Oct 24 2009 	Loved NYNY	Needed a break from my work so I took off for a few days during the week to NYNY. This is the smallest of the MGM/Mirage properties and you can tell. I never hit any real crowd. No waiting to check in at 11:30 AM and checking out was done over the TV and dropping the &quot;keys&quot; into a drop box. I had reserved a Spa Suite and it was wonderful. Lots of room to move about and everything was in great shape. No smoke residue, no cigarette burns, room was very clean and the view was great. I ran into no problems whatsoever. Everyday the room was picked up and stocks were replenished. Did not spend any time at the pool since I heard that it is so small. I did venture down and it is really small so I didn't spend time there.The gaming situation was fine. Although the dealers were very cold to me, the slots were very generous. Choices for dining were good as well. I loved the fish &amp; chips for about $10. The food in the food court was very good and reasonably priced.My only real regret is that there was no coffeemaker in the room, but most of the other hotels do not have them either. All in all, this is a very good hotel. If you're looking for affordable, but not cheap, close to the action, but not overwhelmed in it, something clean but not dated, you should be happy with this hotel. I liked it so much, I have booked the same room for December 22 - 25."
25,407,"Oct 22 2009	Great stay at New York New York	Our last visit to Vegas was very nice. It was the first visit for us to stay at New York New York. We found the hotel very comfortable. These were 2 free nights. Check-in was very smooth &amp; fast &amp; the employees were very friendly &amp; helpful. The room was a typical hotel room, nothing fancy but comfortable &amp; all that we needed. The only thing we would have liked to have was a coffee maker so we did'nt have to go out or order in for our usual cup of morning coffee. Would definitely stay again."
26,407,"Oct 22 2009 	It's no Venetian	Well... when you go from staying at the Venetian for two nights to the NYNY you are bound to be disappointed but we got a GREAT deal on a room so we switched hotels for the remainder of our stay. We were upgraded to a 'suite' but I'm not sure why it was called that. The room was tiny but the bed was comfortable. We were on the 32nd floor and could still hear the roller coaster, airplanes, and traffic noise (not impressed). The room was dated. But we loved all the restaurants the NY had to offer."
27,407,Oct 20 2009 	Loved the hotel!	We got a free upgrade to the Spa Suite and it was amazing. Everything was very clean and well kept. This hotel is right across the street from MGM and Excalibur and there are pedestrian bridges linking NY NY to these hotels. This makes it easy for walking to and from the different hotels. this is definitely worth the money...we stayed at Excalibur for one night and it was definitely subpar for the price. Definitely recommend this hotel and will not stay at anything less in Vegas anymore! Only downfall was that internet costs $14/day.
28,407,"Oct 18 2009 	The Best Hotel in Las Vegas!	What can i say, this hotel, just like most of Las Vegas is simply amazing. Stayed for 4 nights with freinds, this was my first time in Las Vegas. The room to start was huge, all 800 square feet of it, it was worth paying for it. Spotlessly clean, couldn't fault it. I couldn't get over how big the hotel was. Check-in in was easy, quick and hassle-free, not too busy this time of month either. There were a few things that i found dissapointing though...The rollercoaster on the roof - not worth the $14 for one go. Ask for a high floor - we were on the fifth with no view what so ever, only the sight of the rollercoaster going past the window 2 minutes! The ONE swimming pool was too small for the grand size of the hotel. The price of the breakfast room service - it was quite outrageous to be honest - $8 for a coffee!!!!! Overall though i'd give it 8/10."
29,407,"Oct 18 2009 	Great Stay Pool Broke	We had a great stay here the room was clean, the atmosphere was good. The only complaint is the pool was brok the whole time of our stay. We enjoyed this hotel and will go again."
30,407,"Oct 17 2009 	A nice place to stay and play	This hotel was actually much better than I expected. The room was clean, the walls were thick, and the bathroom was maintained. What I like about this hotel is the convenience of check in/out and the fact that the elevators are fast and efficient. They move a lot of people up and down and get you to where you're going quickly. The pool looked nice enough but was not nearly as large as some other Vegas pools. The interior of the hotel is quite interesting as it was made to replicate New York City: you can walk through what look to be alleyways, and narrow streets. The location of the hotel speaks for itself: across the street is MGM Grand, to the South is Excalibur, and to the North is Monte Carlo. I find the casino very accessible and lively. It's layout is pretty good in my opinion. The cocktail waitresses are plenty and are really quick at getting you what you order. I would definitely stay here again, because of my comfortable stay, and because of the location."
31,407,"Oct 17 2009 	Nice atmosphere about this hotel	We stayed in NYNY for our third visit - this time in a hot tub suite, and enjoyed every minute of our stay.Nice atmosphere, especially in the 'streets' around where the duelling pianos are."
32,407,"Oct 15 2009 	Great!!	We loved it, they have everything you could want right there in the hotel!!"
33,407,"Oct 14 2009 	good value	Check-in went smoothly - we had reserved a &quot;playcation&quot; room package, which was $69 per night and included a park ave strip view room and some coupons. We checked in at around 11 a.m. and our room was ready. We had a room on the 27th floor with a king-sized bed. I've stayed at almost every hotel on the Strip, including the Wynn, Bellagio, Paris, MGM, Flamingo, Circus Circus, Mirage, Treasure Island, etc. Obviously this wasn't as nice or big as the higher-end hotels, but the room looked recently remodeled, and was clean, quiet and comfortable. We rented a car, and getting in and out of the parking garage was very easy. Also, the hotel is close to the freeway so its very easy to get in and out. We didn't think we would use the coupons, but we ended up using the welcome cocktail coupons, the 2-for-1 breakfast at Il Fornaio, and the 20% off Nathans coupon. Added bonus!"
34,407,"Oct 14 2009 	Great Place	We stayed at the NYNY in Las Vegas for a &quot;girls weekend&quot;. It was clean and comfortable. The location was was more towards the end of the strip but it was not difficult getting around. Rooms are smaller than others, but for the price it could not be beat. Great gaming tables. The dueling pianos are worth seeing. Great entertainment."
35,407,"Oct 12 2009 	Awesome!	We had a better view from our room than any of the other couples who traveled with us and stayed in other hotels. We also payed a lot less. Location is wonderful, shops/ restaurants were great, and the casino was fabulous! We will be staying there if and when we go back out there!"
36,407,"Oct 11 2009 	Beyond our expectations	I have to say, I was nervous about this hotel. Having never been to Vegas I wasn't quite sure what to expect but when we walked into the room I was pleansantly surprised. It was quite large, great view of the strip and was very clean. Nice decor and while it didn't have a flat screen TV or anything particularly fancy, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was a good size for a hotel (with marble flooring). The hotels New York theme was kinda neat, the roller coaster was fun to ride (though ridiculously overpriced, but as I found out, most things in Vegas are) but I think next time I'd stay more center strip as it is quite a walk from &quot;the action&quot;. Try and stay in a room above the 10th floor as apparently there is quite a bit of noise from the roller coaster below that. What was totally ridiculous and I'm sure is standard at other hotels in Vegas also is the $3/day charge for the phone. We didn't even USE the phone and were charged. Also, there is no free internet here, it's $15 per 24 hrs. which I think in this day is absurd. But really, this is a fine hotel to stay in, so long as you aren't looking for luxury. If not for the location, I'd stay here again for sure. Pj"
37,407,"Oct 11 2009 	I would stay here again!	My mom and I stayed at New York New York for 3 nights. The room was small, but clean and comfortable. We loved the atmosphere-it was more laid back than other hotel/casinos, but had plenty to do. The pool was closed on our last day due to a water problem, but they arranged for us to be able to use the pools at 3 nearby casinos. Our wake-up call was late-luckily we were already up. The rooms were super quiet-we had a strip view with the roller coaster outside our window and we hardly heard the noise."
38,407,"Oct 11 2009 	Beautiful hotel and great casino!	I had a fabulous time staying in the New York New York Hotel and Casino. The rooms were beautiful as was the view from our windows. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was plenty of entertainment and good restaurants located right inside the hotel. It is also located right on the strip so you have easy access to a ton of other casinos, restaurants, and fabulous shopping. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and I will definitely be staying there again!"
39,407,Oct 11 2009 	Perfect Location on the Strip	Stayed at New York New York for 3 nights in July 2009. Could not have asked for a more convenient location on the strip.
40,407,"Oct 10 2009 	This hotel/casino has a wide variety of entertainment and eating venues.	New York New York was a great experience. It is located near the monorail (in the MGM Grand), and has a lot of choices for dining, entertainment, and relaxation. The service was good, and we particularly loved Il Fornao - a wonderful Italian restaurant centrally located in the hotel."
41,407,"Oct 10 2009 	Loads of fun!	This was a really fun hotel to stay at. Our room was very and quiet at night. We liked the big selection of places to eat at, and all the neat places to shop. The New York theme was really neat, I've never been there but sort of know what it must be like in New York! My husband liked the roller coaster, it was expensive but he thought it was worth it. We can't wait to come back some day!"
42,407,"Oct 9 2009 	great stay!	this place was fantastic, i had a room in the century tower over looking the 4 corners, what a veiw! staff was freindly room was clean very nice, and houekeeping will leave u lots of goodies if u leave a small tip! me $2 sign up or their email deals, which includes alll mgm, mirage properties, and you will get great email deals. i paid $29 per night !"
43,407,Oct 9 2009 	Great Rooms With Great Value	The hotel was close to everything. The rooms were great for the price. We had a view of the MGM Grand and could see the sun rise in the morning.
44,407,"Oct 8 2009 	Fun place with lots to do!	I took a trip here with some friends for a friend's 40th birthday bash. We had a great time! This was our 2nd time here, and we were not disappointed. Room was very nice, with a great view of the strip. The only drawback was it was a bit of a hike from the elevator. Very nice casino, and some great restaurants and bars in house. Coyote Ugly was a blast!! It was a great choice for a &quot;homebase&quot; for our Las Vegas stay."
45,407,"Oct 8 2009 	Great Place	This is the second time I've stayed at the NYNY and have been pleased both times. The hotel was full because of the fight at the MGM that weekend, but it was still an enjoyable stay and the staff quickly took care of everything."
46,407,"Oct 8 2009	NewYork NewYork Hotel	We spent 3 nights at this hotel in Las Vegas in June with 9 other friends. The service there was outstanding and we ate at several restaurants/food stands in the hotel and had great food every time... from the fancy restaurants all the way to the Nathan's mini corn dogs! We didn't win any money in the casino there, but sure had a lot of fun. It was a great location too. The only downside was the freeway ran rather close to the pool and it got a bit noisy and stinky at certain times. Otherwise we really liked the pool atmosphere :)"
47,407,"Oct 8 2009 	Faultless.	Could not find fault with NYNY, last time we stayed in the MGM Grand and suffice to say we felt NYNY was a far better hotel. We were in the Century building and the rooms were spotless, beds very comfortable and all appliances etc in working order (including the very handy ipod docking station).We had a breathtaking view of the south Strip, the pool was small but once you found a space it was very nice indeed. NYNY hads tons of on site dining options, all you could ever need for a good stay and overall it's a very moderately priced hotel with a great location and atmosphere.Excellent!"
48,407,"Oct 8 2009 	The room were really big!	We booked the &quot;couples package&quot; at the New York - New York for Sept. 27 - Sept. 30. Our room was upgraded to a Park Ave. room. Both the room and bathroom were very large. It was also very quiet. Booking through the &quot;couples package&quot;, we received a coupon book good for 2 free drinks, 2 for 1 breakfast, and a 2 for 1 roller coaster ride. We would definitely stay here again."
49,407,"Oct 8 2009 	Great view. Room was okay...	HOTEL ROOM: We stayed at the NY, NY hotel on the strip. We reserved a 2 night stay for $109/night. Check in was smooth with no problem except that our room was not ready. It was an early check-in so it wasn't their fault. However, they still offered us a free upgrade to a bigger room on the 34th floor with a view. The room had a long hallway before getting into the sleeping area which they justified as more square footage. Though the hallway was georgous, it had no function. The actual location of the sleeping area and sitting area was quite small. The TV was &lt;26&quot; and was located way across from the bed. So watching TV from bed was difficult. The bathroom was a good size with a walk-in shower, no tub. The showerhead was an older type and didn't spray out so well. There was what looked like a fridge under the sink area. It was actually just an ice maker. It didn't make any ice but made a loud humming sound every 10 minutes. The best thing about the room was the view. Their were 4 large windows facing West. There was a backdrop of a mountain range, the Orleans casino and what seems like a residential community. During the day it wasn't much but the sunset and night view was well worth it. FITNESS CENTER: The fitness area was one the other side of the property on the 3rd floor. It cost $25 to get in. The provided free bottled water, fruit and towels. The lounge area was clean and nicely decorated. Had about 6 treamills, 2 ellipticles and 2 stationary bikes. All with individual TV monitors. Also, had Olympic freeweights. Staff at the fitness center was friendly and helpful. FOOD AND BARS: Many of restaraunts at the hotel. Food was good. &quot;The America Grill&quot; charged your for every little item. Can you believe... $1.50 for a side of ranch? Otherwise food was good. The bar at the &quot;Dueling Pianos&quot; is a major rip off. Charged us $9 for a domestic draft beer in a plastic cup. Better place to drink is back at the &quot;America Grill&quot;.BEST THING: Best thing I liked about NY, NY was the location on the strip. You are across MGM, Tropicana and Excaliber. All connected via a pedestrian bridge. WORST THING: The thing I hated about the hotel was the front desk reps. You always get a different answer from them. We were trying to stay an extra night. The night before, a rep said it would be the same rate as we paid for the previous nights ($109). Then when we came down to book the extra night, a differenct rep said it would be $149 and wouldn't budge. Then that night, we decided to take the $149 and they said it was gone. So we figured we were SOL. That morning another rep said, &quot;Oh, no problem you can stay another night for $79.&quot; So frustrating. No one could get their stories straight. Bottom line... Don't try to modify your reservation. They'll just get confused."
50,407,"Oct 8 2009 	New York New York Las Vegas	Great trip to Las Vegas but was disappointed with New York New York. We liked the location, food okay, small pool, gambling okay and over all we did enjoy the trip.We probably will not stay at NYNY again, to many really other hotels that are bigger and nicer."
51,407,"Oct 8 2009 	Wonderful hotel and friendly staff!	My boyfriend and I were coming through Vegas for the day and booked a Park Avenue room with a view of the Strip. We had really high hopes for NYNY because we had a bad experience at the Stratosphere earlier in our trip. Upon our arrival, we were informed that the room was not available. We stated that we would take the 2 Queen beds once we were told all King beds were taken for the Park Avenue rooms. We didn't get angry and just went along with it. I don't know if it was our calm demeanor, but the desk attendant decided to upgrade us to the Ziggurat Suite!! We were so excited. The room was amazing and were able to have our King bed after all. It just shows that being courteous when things don't go as planned can go a long way!! Thanks NYNY!!"
52,407,"Oct 8 2009 	Used to be good	Dirtier than average. Charges for internet use approx $18 per 24 hr. Even airports have wireless access nowadays. The offer coupons for breakfast, betting, spa, etc which are difficult to cash in. We ended up eating at the MGM which is next to it."
53,407,Oct 5 2009 	Not a bad place to stay!	Stayed at NYNY in late August in the Chrysler wing. My room was facing the mountains and above the rollercoaster (thank goodness!). The room was kinda lack-luster....but clean! No flat-screen tv &amp; a no-frills bathroom.Great food &amp; a great location!I'd rank this hotel a 3.5.
54,407,"Oct 4 2009 	Fun hotel amongst the Vegas glitz	This was my second trip to Las Vegas and I chose the New York New York for its mid price range and fun facade. I was very happy with my choice - the four nights I spent there were very comfortable and entertaining.I have seen a few reviews that complain about long check-in lines - since I arrived at 1:30AM I didn't have this trouble. I think the receptionist could tell I was very jet-lagged and ready to drop so he just quickly confirmed everything, showed me a map of the hotel (my hotel needs its own MAP?!) and pointed me in the direction of the correct elevator. My room was on the fifteenth floor of the New Yorker tower and had a view over the roller coaster to the Monte Carlo and some parking lots behind. With two queen beds and a whole lot of extra space it was very comfortable. The air conditioner was a bit noisy but I ended up turning it off - the room kept its cool quite well overnight if the air con was run during the day. I did hear a little &quot;noise&quot; from the room next door one morning but it was faint and I say good luck to them. ;-)The marble bathroom was really nice, with a good bath and shower. I was a little bemused though that despite all the signs asking for the conservation of water through reusing towels, the maid changed my towels every day no matter where I hung them. As someone from a dry climate I was really trying to be environmentally friendly but the maid service wasn't cooperating.Perhaps it was because I went in the late afternoon or perhaps it was because it was outside main holiday season, but I didn't think the pool was small and crowded like some other reviewers. I would have liked it to have a deep section (it is 3 feet for most of the pool and 4 in one small area) and perhaps to be a bit cooler given the hot outside temperatures but it was lovely to be able to kick back with a margarita in the pool or on a sun lounge in the late afternoon. I didn't go to Vegas to sit beside a hotel pool all day!Perhaps my one criticism would be of a hot dog place I tried late one evening - it had to be the most pathetic and revolting hot dog I have ever had, coupled with burned fries and a &quot;root beer&quot; that tasted like cough medicine. My bad for going down to the lobby half asleep and choosing the first hot dog stand I saw - I think the better one may have been near the bar! I also tried to get room service breakfast on my final morning but on my first two attempts got no answer at all and on the third attempt gave up after waiting on hold for 5 minutes.New York New York is a fun hotel to stay in. It's convenient to the rest of the Strip (although not central - if you don't want to walk, catch the bus or monorail), the casino section is reasonable but not so enormous you get lost and it has great facilities. You could stay there a week and eat at a different outlet/restaurant every night and still not cover them all I suspect."
55,407,Oct 3 2009 	Honeymoon in vegas	We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon and it was our first time in Las Vegas. The location of the hotel is great. Our corner room was very spacious and had the most amazing views of the strip and the mountains. Nothing luxurious about the room but nothing to complain. We did hear the roller coaster but only if you really listened for it. We ate at many restaurants. Nine Fine Irishmen was my favorite. Nice atmosphere and great food. Chin Chin Caf was overpriced and nothing more than you could get from an everyday takeout restaurant. Il Fornaio was good but not a great value. America had large portions so we split the food since we did not have a fridge in our room. One thing we soon discovered about Las Vegas is there isn't much open before 8am. Being from the East Coast we were up and ready at 6 or 7am Vegas time and had to walk across the street to McDonalds. We went to Zoomanity and had a wonderful time. Beware if you intend to sit in the first few rows and aren't interested in being interactive. We visited many of the other hotels and shows. Plan on walking a lot and keep traffic in mind when taxiing to a show at another hotel. Great trip. Will likely try other hotels for future trips as there are so many to choose from.
56,407,"Oct 2 2009 	Nice Hotel Very Expensive Phone Charges	Great hotel to stay in, rooms dark. We made a ten minute call to Las Angeles, and the phone bill came out more expensive than the room cost. Don't use their phones at all. Pool only has limited hours. No fridge in room's. Close to all the fun and activity of Vegas, and well worth the stay."
57,407,"Sep 29 2009 	AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME	Stayed here for 6 days and still could have stayed longer ! Fab place, Neat and tidy well equimpt rooms. Excellent room service and cleaning. If you get the chance to treat yourself at &quot;the Spa&quot; I would highly recomend. Staff super friendly . the casino down stairs has several top class restaurants, and a fab little french cafe for great fresh fruit breakfasts. Nightlife is excellent with the piano bar and &quot;the Rok&quot; nightclub. The roller coaster is a must, cause where else in the world can you &quot;coast &quot; around your hotel ! Really you don't even need to leave this hotel to get the best of vegas !! Cant wait to go again"
58,407,"Sep 29 2009 	One SLEEPLESS night because of a FIREBRAT	Out of a 4 night stay, we had ONE SLEEPLESS night. We arrived Tuesday evening, checked out Saturday afternoon. Check-in was uneventful and quick. Our room was on the 32nd floor of the Chrysler building overlooking the strip, the bridge and the roller coaster. GREAT VIEW and pretty quiet even though we could hear the roller coaster going until about 1am. Because we are from NY and accustomed to some noise, it did not affect our stay. It seemed clean enough. The hotel lobby provides several good places to eat: pizza- SIrrico's, sandwiches- Goldberg's Deli, italian - Il Fornaio. Gallagher's offers aged beef but very pricey - one aged steak, one order of mashed potatoes, one baby spinach salad, one new england clam chowder and three glasses of wine = $99.00 not including tip. I had lost my appetite Friday night and so didn't really eat, I only picked from my husband's meal. The hotel is one of the &quot;four corners&quot; shared with MGM, Luxor and Tropicana. The walkways connect the four hotels and allow you to cross the strip above traffic. The hotel lobby is kept pretty cold so I had to have a shawl with me when we hung out at the lobby. The hotel is not as big and overwhelming as MGM and you can get through it fairly quickly and easily. The pool is small when compared to the amount of rooms and guests staying. Finding a lounge chair is difficult and you can end up with a towel on the hard concrete surrounding the pool. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our stay until Friday night when we were AWAKENED from a pre-dinner nap by a BUG in the bed! We caught the critter in one of the glasses they provide, called the front desk, they sent management up. We insisted that they find out what that thing was as we did NOT want to take anything back home with us. They offered to move us to another room, which did not make any sense to me since we didn't know that a) we weren't taking any with us to another room and b) that there weren't any in another room. So, we requested that they clean the room, vacuum and replace the linen. We were leaving the next morning anyway and were so tired and freaked out that we just wanted to know what that thing was. When their &quot;eco&quot; people came about 1:00 am, they informed us it was a &quot;FIREBRAT,&quot; and not a bedbug. While we were relieved, we did not sleep well that last night. Our only compensation was that they allowed us to check out past 11:00am. Up to that point we were very impressed by the cleanliness of the room. We have stayed a various hotels ranging from the upscale at the Napili Kai in Maui to the low low Danvers Days Inn in Massachussetts and have NEVER come across a bug in the bed. Disappointed not only at the possibility that bugs are a possibility in even upscale hotels, but that NYNY didn't even offer to discount the sleepless night at all. SUGGESTION: ALWAYS check for critters BEFORE unpacking and settling into a room. Remove all bed linen and check the mattresses and bedframe before settling-in for your stay. This way if you find anything you can remedy the situation before they charge you and before you expose any of your clothing or belongings."
59,407,"Sep 29 2009 	Good value on the strip	Had to cut my trip short, but what I saw was pretty good. Hotel was decent, Nine fine Irishmen had good food quality. Didnt gamble all that much but comped half of our final bill including food and hotel. Staff were friendly, would stay here again although i am going to try a downtown hotel next trip."
60,407,"Sep 28 2009 	DISAPPOINTING	The trip was disappointing. I'm from Michigan and have 20 casinos to pick from here,and they do pay off better than Las Vegas. This was our third year of going out to Vegas and our last. We are better off staying home. Each one of us came home with the flu. Our room was nice at the NYNY and so was our service except we had to fight to get our $25 freeplay. The payoffs are terrible. Didn't win anything until we left the strip."
61,407,"Sep 26 2009 	Great Hotel would definately return!	We stayed here for a week in September, and the hotel was absolutely fantastic with plenty to offer. Our favourite bar was the one at Times Square, definitely recommended!We had a Park Avenue Deluxe room which had either 2 queen size beds or a king. They were very well equipped, spacious and cleaned every day. The only thing that could be missed by some is tea and coffee making facilities. Our room also looked out towards the roller coaster - the noise really isn't that bad!! and it also seemed to finish running at around 11pm everynight. The location of the hotel was great for us. Directly opposite was the MGM Grand which has its own monorail station. This was handy because for approx $13 you could ride unlimited times for 24hours and this takes you all the way up the strip, the last stop being close to the Stratosphere.During our stay we used the pool numerous times, generally the sun didn't get to the pool until midday but staff at the New York did advise you can use the pool at the Monte Carlo hotel also.Over all I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return again."
62,407,"Sep 26 2009 	Nice Hotel	I am posting this review almost two years having stayed at this hotel, so a lot could have changed in that time. I am new to this site and wanted to share my experience of staying at the New York, New York. For what we payed at the time of our stay, this hotel was worth the money. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Those are the two things that we were looking for in our stay (most people visiting Vegas don't spend a lot of time in their room). The location was nice and we pretty much walked down the strip during the day. I loved all the food options in the different parts of New York in the hotel. One of the few negative things I could say about this hotel was the fact that our room was pretty much at the opposite side of the hotel and it took a few minutes to walk to our room. I'm not sure if that happens in a lot of other hotels but you pretty much needed to make sure you had everything when you left the hotel room for the day. The pool was also closed when we went (last week of February) and opened the day we left. There was only one pool and it was pretty small, too. I have seen other hotels that have several pools that are open for most of the year. We had problems checking in (the computer said we didn't have a reservation upon check-in), but I don't blame the hotel, that was the fault of the travel site we booked our trip through. The front desk and manager promptly and politely helped us figure things out. I would probably stay somewhere else on our next trip to Vegas, but only because we want to see what the other hotels are like on the strip. This is a good hotel for families with children - big arcade/games and a fun roller coaster. We ended up getting a room that overlooked the roller coaster but there wasn't much noise since the roller coaster closed at 11 p.m. This hotel is great for anyone who wants to stay on the South end of the strip. We found the staff great and never had any problems. The casino was really nice, too and there was lots of room to walk around."
63,407,"Sep 24 2009 	fabulous las vegas has something for everyone	Had a great time in vegas this was our second visit to vegas and 2nd stay at the new york new york hotel on the strip. The hotel is very well situated to the strip , airport,monorail and much more. The hotel has several eating area's that are of various price range and several bars and of course huge casino hall. Our favourite bar is time square were they have 2 piano players who whip the croud into a frenzy with their sing offs, banter and interaction great place for fun,The hotel has lovely rooms with either 2 queen size beds or a king, and they are well equiped and spacious and were cleaned every day.The new york new york has been doing some work over the last 2 years in the main casino area, with some new trendy bars etc. Although the New york new york is not the most glamourous compared to the Bellagio and Ceasers palace it is definatley a lot more fun and laid back with plent y of choice and lots to do for everyone. The hotel is based on New york and has a relpica of the manhatten bridge,statue of liberty and several other references to new york. I love this hotel and would recomend it to everyone. Vegas itself is under a mammoth construction on the strip which will be amazing by the opening early 2010.Vegas has so much to offer and we loved it even although we are not really into gambling it's worth playing a few machines/tables as you never you may win and it's a bit of fun, besides when playing the machines etc the waitress brings your drinks which helps to keep the cost down as they only require tips.Weather in vegas was very hot and there is plenty of opportunity to lie back and enjoy the sun by the pool and some cafe/restaurants or to avoid the heat all the hotels, shops etc are all airconditioned which was a welcome relief.When in vegas i recomend the helicopter ride over the grand canyon which was just fabulous and breathtaking as well as fun, also you should check out the free light/fountain show that are on at many hotels as they are well worth a visit. If you ever wanted to try gospel, vegas is the place to do it you should try it out at the Gospel brunch in the house of blues in the mandalay bay hotel it is fantastic, great fun, a little pricey at $50 each for a buffet and drinks which was amazing with a huge selection of foods from waffle station, fruit and pastries to carved meet, and much more and mimosa( champagen &amp; orange juice) and bloody mary's lined up on the bar, perfect for a sunday morning.Whilst in vegas do pick up the free guides as they are very useful with info on whats going on,maps and promotions ( we got a few vouchers and were able to use it at the goepel brunch) these are available in most hotels, monorails, taxi etc. After leaving the brunch we stumbled upon a bar(also manadalay bay) called minus 5 which was great, very cold but a fun experience were they kit you ready to go and party, where everything is made of ice including you rglass, tables etc, well wortha visit, $25 stay as long as you can and have a cocktail or beer of your entrance fee(only disappointment was couldnt take camera in as they dont allow but i guess it very cold, you have to but their own which is a bit of a con but well worth a visit). There is quite a cool collection of vintage,classic cars at the imperial palace that my husband really enjoyed ( good to get of the strip in the middle of the day).When purchasing any tickets for and shows etc chect out the cheap ticket booths on the strip where you get good deals on shows, exabitions,and restaurant deals, we got a voucher for $4 dollars each for Harrahs restaurant flavour which offered an extensive buffet choice at a really good price. Its worth checking out the prices at the hotel as we purchased tickets at the booths only to discover could have got cheaper at hotel ( although we still got a good deal would been betterif we had waited,the only thing is depending what the availablity is on the day. We checked out Love in the Mirage which was brilliant,worth a vist if yo want to be amazed with the acrobats,music and story.Although we had a really good time there were a few niggles: Tax on everything was a pain, and the guys on the street handing out cards for call girls, and the fact that we were id lots even though we are mid 30's and early 40's but other than that great. It is a bit pricey drinking on the strip but there are several bars and hotels do promotions and you will find it cheaper if you go off the strip a little.Head downtown to freemont st for the freemont experience which is a laser light show which is good and have a visit to the golden nugget and queens hotels as these are some of the original vegas, golden nugget has a really good asian resturant(ishis ?)and a very new modern bar and its cheaper, head downtown to a piano bar called Don't tell mama where they have a couple of singers who take requests and encourage the crowd to join in, bit more professional than a karaoke and the girls behind the bar are very warm and friendly and great singers.Looking forward to our next trip to vegas."
64,407,"Sep 24 2009 	Good value for money at New York New York	We had a Park Avenue Deluxe room on the 27th floor which was spacious and cleaned daily. I wouldn't describe this hotel as a 5 star as stated on some web sites but it was comfortable and more than adequate if you don't spend much time in your room like us! There are plenty of places to eat and drink within the hotel, but we preferred to venture out to eat the majority of the time.Nothing is a short walk away in Vegas as everything is so huge but the location is excellent with all the best hotels on The Strip within a reasonable walking distance so I would recommend this hotel for location.The best thing about this hotel is the location and price, the worst is if you want to stay in a &quot;grand&quot; hotel this isn't as impressive as some of the others on The Strip - depends what you like to spend your money on!!"
65,407,"Sep 24 2009 	Ok but not amazing	We stayed at New York New York for 7 nights in Sept 2009. Check in - Possibly the slowest check in I've experienced ever! We arrived about lunch time to a check in queue of about 10 couples and it took 20 mins, simply as they only had 2 receptionists on! Customer service not particularly good, they were definitely just going through the motions. We were asked if we wanted a room with a view for $15 a night more, which we declined as we had not come to vegas to look out the window! When we got to the room we had the best view ever, which made us think we were going to get that room anyway - sneaky!Room - We stayed in room 2480 in the Century Tower on the 24th floor, with a view straight onto the strip facing MGM Grand across the road - amazing view! Bed was very comfortable and very big. Room was a decent size, clean, with a decent bathroom too. The only issue we had with the room is that it has an inter-connecting door with the room next door. This means you can hear everything from the room next door through the door frame! Our first night involved hearing a screaming match between two women for 30 mins at 2.30am! Called security who promptly came up and told them to keep it down. Luckily they left 2 days after and we got a quiet couple next door!Location - New York New York is south strip and a little out of all the action. We constantly used The Deuce buses (stops across the road and outside Monte Carlo next door). Everything looks close, but believe me it isn't! It's just everything is so big! Plus it was 100 degrees constantly, so not good for lots of walking. When I go back to Vegas I will be staying mid strip around Bellagio/ Paris.Pool - It is tiny in relation to the size of the hotel and it was dirty! Loads of bits floating in it, including birds feathers! I didn't even see a single bird in Vegas! Needless to say we only used it once!Restaurants - There is lots of places to eat at New York New York but no buffet restaurant. We ate in America and El Fornaio - both meals fine, but again not fantastic. However the bakery does amazing chocolate croissants!There is plenty of bars at this hotel and places for snacks - there is a frozen daquiri bar that do fab daquiris!Tip - The check out queue was always very long, so I would reccomend express check out through your TV!Vegas was absolutley fantastic, but New York New York was just... ok! Nothing special - I would only go back there if I got a really cheap deal there."
66,407,"Sep 22 2009 	Comfortable and Fun	Clean, no problems with maid service, comfortable pillows and mattress, updated furnishings. We were on the 29th floor, good view, quiet. Room was given to us at checkin 1pm thursday no wait. Restaurants at hotel with comfort food, pizza, hot dogs, coffee, no frills, just average. Average Gambling, payout below average.Easy access to MGM Grand, Excalibur, Tropicana. Try MGM Grand Buffet, wide variety of food. Excalibur Buffet NO. Try Deuce all day pass to all other mid strip casinos.Don't miss Freemont Street Experience. Take Monorail to Sahara then take a bus or a cab to Freemont Street, it won't dissapoint, alot of fun for all. Prime Rib 9.99 buy one get one free at Four Queens Casino, plenty of cocktails. Don't Miss this place.Do not go to Coyote Ugly at NYNY if you are over 23 years old or sober. It is a sardine packed room. There is luxourious pools, hotel rooms and casinos in Vegas. Great Restaurants and celebrated chefs in Vegas. If this is what your looking for, this is not the hotel/casino for you ...do not stay here. Fun and young at heart, go for it, you won't be disappointed."
67,407,"Sep 21 2009 	Not all its made out to be.	We made our way to this hotel having book approx 9 months earlier, on arrivals we were given our room which was based on the 25th floor a good way from the escalators, on first looks the room was clean and tidy, like most people you fancy a cup of coffee/ tea either late at night or like us early morning but I am afraid this was not possible as there was no coffee maker/ kettle in the room.This is only a minor point but the other is not so, this is that the Noise which was coming from not only the roller coaster which runs around the outside of the hotel, this did at least stop running around 22:00 hrs, but the other rumblings which seems to occur every 6 to 7 minutes this was put down to the monorail which operates from the Excalibur hotel across the road, somehow this monorail manages to transmit its noise across the road and up to the 25 floor of this hotel and i must admit it did cause me to have at least 2 nights poor sleep, (not going to bed until the early hours of the morning did help a little on the other nights) Otherwise the hotel was average the staff were all friendly and helpful. Another small gripe you did not get free wireless internet it cost 14dollars per 24 hours even at some of the cheaper hotels in which we stopped during our trip wireless internet was free."
68,407,"Sep 21 2009 	Book another Hotel not the New York New York.	We booked this over the INTERNET direct with New York New-York for five days and printed all the Information out about the room,strip view, offers given etc etc.On arrival was given a room at low level over looking the car park and the roller coaster.We went back to check in to be told we have got what we had booked.I tried to explain but it was like talking to a brick wall ,not helpful at all.After showing the print out of the booking we finally was given a strip view room.So from arrival it took three visits back to check in, and still didn't get the room we had booked also the offers booklet given were out of date.We complained on their Web site and still waiting for a reply."
69,407,"Sep 20 2009 	Great trip but a few issues	Stayed for four nights in a Park Avenue Deluxe room on the 19th floor of the Century Tower. First the good points:Fairly good location - We could walk across the pedestrian bridges to MGM Grand and Excalibur. The MGM Grand is a Monorail location while there is a tram at the Excalibur to get to Luxor and Mandalay Bay.Cheap eats - First time eating a Nathan's hot dog. Very good pizza place in the Village as well.Nicely appointed room - Very comfortable room and stylishly decorated.Now for the not so good points:Paper thin walls - We thought someone was trying to open our door. Come to find out it was our neighbors just opening their doors. Could also hear the roller coaster till about 1 am.25 cent machines - After visiting other hotels on the strip, we were least satisfied by the NYNY's selection of 25 cent slot machines. It seemed to cater more towards dollar machines and pennies.We would very likely stay here again, but would probably gamble in the nearby hotels. Had luck at Excalibur and Bellagio."
70,407,"Sep 19 2009 	Great Stay	Check in was ok, upgraded room. Room was very clean and quiet and had strip view. Casino was slow but friendly. Lots of options for food but no buffet. Food was good and reasonably priced. Good location. Would return in future."
71,407,"Sep 17 2009 	I absolutely Loved this place! couldn't have chosen better!	Being the Vegas virgins that we were I found the choice of hotels very daunting when i booked this trip. My husband is a theme park fanatic and said he'd only take me to Vegas if I booked a hotel with decent attractions! I origionally booked the Strat but was put off when they didn't reply to any of my e-mails and when I got a letter from my tour company saying that some of the facilities were closed at the strat and the area is a bit run-down. I chose NYNY as my friends were in Vegas at the same time on their honeymoon in the MGM Grand and I wanted something that was sligtly more up-market than the Strat but not as prices as the MGM. The upgrade I was charged was the best 100 - odd, that I've ever spent! We spent the week going in and out of most of the hotels on the strip and I actually felt a bit smug as we kept saying that we preferred nearly every aspect of our hotel than the others and we were glad we didn't splash the cash on the MGM as it was very, very, crowded and far too big for us although lovely just to visit for a few hours. (Having said that, had a great night in the West Wing Bar there) We had a Park Avenue Deluxe Room and even though it was a smoking room it was still big, comfortable and well equipt. Didn't expect I-pod dock! &amp; we had a great side strip View of the Monte Carlo and even with the Rollercoaster going past all the time, we couln't hear it at all.All the hotel facilities were great and good value too. We hired a cabana on one day and found it to be great value for money. We were also given a list of promotions on at the NYNY &amp; Monte Carlo that helped a lot money-wise with Discount on the Restaurants and bars and also show tickets &amp; Rides etc.There are some great places to eat and drink at NYNY too which was part of the attraction for us. and we ate at the America restaurant on a few ocassions as the food was excellent quality and value in great surroundings ($17.95 for a 2 course steak dinner and a beer in a strip hotel is a bargain!)I also can't fault the service in any of the establishments, the staff in America, The front desk and by the pool were efficient, smart, knowledgeable and attentive, there was one exception to that on the casino floor, but he was just my bad luck charm and a cue to stop gambling away my holiday spends!I loved Vegas, and i will be back when I can afford it and would reccomend NYNY to anyone, we are glad we splashed out but decided that when we go again and the budget might not stretch that far, we liked the south side of the strip and would also consider Excalibur and Tropicana as cheaper options."
72,407,"Sep 15 2009 	Hotel good would probably stay elsewhere next time	My partner and I were in Las Vegas to get married. I emailed hotel in advance to find out if there was a possibility of complimentary or reduced rate upgrades given that we were celebrating a special occassion. I was told that they would make a note on the system but they could not guarantee upgrades. I asked at check in and the girl who was working was very rude. She barely looked at us and said no free upgrades, it would be $40 per night during week and more at weekend. Americans checking in at the desk next to us were offered the same upgrades for $10 per night! Not good start. Park Avenue Room was small but nice. We had view of back of side of MGM and rollercoster. Rest of hotel was fun. Food places were good. We ate at America, Sirroccos and Chin Chin. Drinks were expensive in hotel and bar staff rude yet they expect a tip. If you are looking for cheaper drinks then Casino Royal further up the strip has $1 beers and cocktails. Casino was airier than most and was nice. Pool was ok. Overall the hotel was good although I would probably stay somewhere closer to the centre of the strip next time."
73,407,Sep 15 2009 	Viva Las Vegas!	Nice hotel but I think probably like most of the Hotels in Vegas noisy and busy all the time. The only peace we got was in our room which is where you need it but saying that you don't go to Vegas for a rest. It is a must see quite amazing with all the different people and VERY hot in August. Only problem with this hotel was the the small swimming pool and I did not see any showers so you can imagine the water by the end of the day!
74,407,"Sep 14 2009 	it did the job for our stay. but not luxury	very pleasant check in staff. although we enquired about upgrading our room were told there was no rooms available even though we were going to be paying for an upgrade. we had an 8th floor room in the new yorker tower with an &quot;excellent&quot; view of a roof and the end of the rollercoaster. Only good thing was we never heard the coaster from our room. the room was nicely decorated and very clean with a very good housekeeping service. would have liked some coffee making facilities in the room but starbucks was just outside the entrance to our tower. Dined in Gallaghers and the Italian restaurant both were really good. The pool area was really busy and very cramped with NO space between loungers. Most of the pool area is shaded until at least 12 noon. But once the sun hits there is no sun brolleys for shade. Good waitress service for food and drink at the pool. Another good thing is that if the pool loungers are unattended for more than 30mins the lifeguards remove the towels and allow others to use,So it stops people &quot;reserving beds early in the morning and not showing up till lunchtime&quot; All in all this hotel is ok for a few nights stay but if you are expecting 5 star luxury go somewhere else. Oh also the spa is great for a bit of pampering I recommend the hot stone massage and pedicure. Look out for coupons in the rooms we got a good deal for the spa and also got 2 tickets for zumanity show for 100bucks we thought for the price we would get rubbish seats but we got 2nd row front."
75,407,"Sep 14 2009 	I loved every minute of my hoiday and to stay in this hotel was superb!

Would recommend anyone this hotel!!! xxxx"
76,407,"Sep 13 2009 	Good Location 	This was my first time staying at the NY NY but have visted this casino on several occasions. Typically we stay at the Golden Nugget b/c we enjoy the atmosphere there much better. But, the NY NY was running a Summer Special that we could not pass up. SUMMER BREAK ESCAPE : $65 per night Tues-Thurs - 35% off Zumanity tickets at NYNY- 2-for-1 Drinks at BRAND Steakhouse at Monte Carlo- 2-for-1 Roller Coaster passes at NYNY- 2-for-1 Buffet at Monte Carlo- 2-for-1 ROK Vegas Nightclub Admission at NYNY- 2-for-1 II Fornaio Breakfast at NYNY- 2-for-1 Lance Burton tickets at Monte Carlo- 2-for-1 Spa admission at Monte CarloService: The hotel service was okay. The staff was friendly but not overly friendly. I was offered an upgrade to a suite for an extra $90/night. Ummm, no thanks! Room: The room was a decent size. We were located in the New Yorker Tower and had some strange noise throughout the entire stay. At first I thought it was the roller coaster but when the noice belted out I ran to the window to see if the coaster was rolling by but no such luck. It wasn't too annoying but did wake me up several times throughout the night. Places to Eat: There are several choices for food at this hotel. We ate at Chin Chin ($12-15pp) which was good, fresh Chinese cuisine. We also grabbed a couple of slices of pizza at Sirraros ($4 slice $15 whole pie). Gonzalez y Gonzalez was pretty good and quite resonably priced ($10-$15pp). There are several other places to eat such as ESPN Zone, and tons of places to snack... Ben n Jerry's, Starbucks... Location: The location of the hotel is great for strolling the south end of the Las Vegas Strip. Some of the close hotels are the Luxor, MGM, Monte Carlo (We ate their buffett as part of the 2-1 deal and it was GREAT. Loved the made to order Philly Cheesesteak sandwich.) Overall we had a positive experience. But given the choice, we will stay downtown at the Golden Nuggett. If you want to experience the Strip, this would be a good choice given the right deal."
77,407,"Sep 11 2009 	I enjoyed this place	We had stayed from Aug.29 to Sept.4.09. We booked the Summer Escape package that got us a Park Avenue Room with a few extras (2 for 1 on many coupons). Upon arrival, we were greeted by a warm front desk attendant Jessica. She had upgraded us to the Broadway Room on the 17th floor in the New Yorker Tower. There are many towers to the hotel, as it's designed like NY Skyscrapers. Broadway Room: The room was very spacious and had a great view of MGM, and the hotels around it (Hooters, Excalibur, Luxor, Tropican, Mandalay) and the roller coaster. Bed was firm and the sheets were alright. I think I found a cigarette burn, but I didn't pay too much attention to it (Noticed it on the last day). The bathroom was marbled floor and counter with a sliding shower door. An Armoire with coat hangers. My complaint was with the 25&quot; tv approx 15-20 ft from the bed on an angle. Nothing major, since we didn't go to Vegas to spend time in our hotel room :). The room is about 450sq.ft about a bit bigger than the base room at MGM (Grand Tower).Food: We ate at the following places in NYNY Hotel.Il Fornaio (Breakfast) - Service was fairly fast. Had the Corned Beef Hash with poached eggs, while my gf had a veggie omelet. Both were excellent and very fresh. This was part of our deal and we got it at 2/1 deal.Sirrocos (Snack) - Typical pizza place, nothing special. Loaded pizza with toppings, wasn't as thin/crispy as I would like it to be. Ate here twice, was fairly satisfied.Greenbergs Deli - Rueben with Matzoh Ball Soup. Both meals were a great way to end my trip and left me mighty full for the day.America's - If you order the turkey burger here, please ensure it is fully cooked. I had to return mine once as it was still a bit red inside. However, the waitress was more than accommodating and offered us a bowl of Chicken Noodle Soup (very filling). If you are there and looking to eat on the cheap, take advantage of their cheap eats (AYCE Pancakes, 11.99 16oz Ribeye, 14.95 Ribeye/crab legs). I had the Ribeye and it was one of the better steaks I've had. The nachos as well are filling and loaded with your typical toppings.Casino: Always a machine available, casino seemed to be quite slow at times. A fair bit of tables ranging from $10 and up including a rapid roulette table that takes your credit card. Daily slot/blackjack tournaments if you are a players card member (Free to sign up). Drink service is fairly decent for a casino of that size (I've seen worse at MGM or Mandalay) and there's a cigarette lady walking around as well.Nightlife: Bar at Time's Square has dueling pianos which they take requests (for a tip) and will play your favourite songs. LOTS of fun and a group can have a great time. Did not check out the clubs as that's not my scene. Also if you are a beer lover, check out Pour 24. An amazing selection of beers from all over America. My favs are Alaskan Amber Ale and Black Butte. From what we were told, Zumanity is an &quot;Erotic&quot; show, so if this is not your type, look into Love or Ka or O. All of which you can get for a good deal at Tix At Half, located by Planet Hollywood.Overall I did enjoy my stay here at the hotel, more than I did at MGM. A lot less walking, more style and appeal to it for me.Pictures will be up soon, if you have any further questions, shoot me a line."
78,407,"Sep 10 2009 	Very Nice Hotel. Great Price.	I enjoyed my stay at the New York, New York Hotel. My first night I was booked at the Imperial Palace and decided to transfer to the New York, New York. I stayed a total of 4 nights at the New York, New York hotel and would consider staying there again. I would certainly highly recommend it to friends and family. The room was large enough, great view of the strip on the 25th floor (I got a free upgrade), The price for the rooms were very reasonable for a nice quality hotel. The room was clean and everything was brand new. I slept well on the bed and it was quiet. At first, I was concerned with the roller coaster nearby, but it really did not bother me and it's close during the night. For someone who travels frequently on business and pleasure and very picky with hotels this hotel is an excellent place to stay. It's also closer to the airport if you have an earlier flight (the planes did not bother me in the room -- barely heard them). The casiono is nice and big and well maintained. The selection of restaurants are great (i would recommend Gallagher's if you like steak). Not much for shopping, but they have a few stores for souvineers. They also gave me a $100 coupon book and I got restaurant and food discounts, plus free welcome drinks.My only caveat is that it is all the way at the other end of the strip and if you do not like to walk it might be a bit inconvenient. Otherwise, it really is not a bad walk down the strip and besides its nicer to walk and see the sights. I would not recommend that you take the monorail across the street at the MGM Grand unless you're going to the northern part of the strip. It's better to walk to the other casinos and hotels/"
79,407,"Sep 10 2009 	This is not a ""Four Star Hotel""	This is not a &quot;Four Star Hotel and these are the facts:1. During registration the attendant failed to welcome us to the hotel, never addressed me as Sir or Mr., and did not take the time to answer my concerns or questions. Requested a single bed room when reservation was made, got a double bed.2. Room: Room was spacious, with good storage. Mattress was comfortable, however, the bedspread on both beds had large cigarrette burns (in a non smoking room). Called housekeeping to have them replaced and it took two phone calls and over two hours to send an attendant. Desk chair seat had a soiled spot. All the furniture in the room looked old and scratched. The room did not smell clean. Carpet looked and felt dirty.3. Bathroom: Found towels with holes. The towels were not neatly displayed or organized like you normally see in hotel rooms upon arrival.4. Computer / Telephone Charges: Internet access $14.99 daily. Telephone charge $3.00 daily. Use of the computer at the business center to print boarding pass $5.00 minimum charge. Late check out $50.00 charge. No check out line available in the afternoon--I was sent to the back of the check-in line with about 20 people waiting to check-in. 5. Common areas (hallways and elevators): The up keep of the common areas was below average. Hallways were not vaccumed &amp; full of debris, ashtrays not clean or empty by the elevators, and elevators were not clean. 6. Hotel Staff: The hotel staff was rude and unprofessional. They go to great lengths to make excuses instead of finding or offering solutions to the problems. This hotel is overrated and not a good value for the money. Other than good location, there is little to commend this hotel. I will not return to this hotel on my next trip."
80,407,"Sep 9 2009 	Not bad - better than expected	Traveled over the Labor Day weekend- LOTS of people, but hotel was nice. Invited Casino Guest Check in which went very quickly. Friendly Staff. Room was on the 34th floor - if your scared of heights, I suggest not so high - kind of an uneasy feeling being so high in the air, but great view of the mountains.Room as nice, clean - larger than expected but bathroom was very small in comparison to the room. Could not sit on the toilet and close the door. Shower pressure was good and bathroom was clean.Bed was so-so, more on the harder side - windows were clean and the room was generally clean. Maid service did a nice job every day.Woud stay again."
81,407,"Sep 8 2009 	Nice Place but ventilaiton needs improvement	First off, I should mention that the NYNY, Las Vegas is one of the nicer MGM Grand properties. The design and layout of the facility is much more convenient than the massive hotels like The Venetian where we stayed on our last trip. We arrived on Saturday evening of Labor Day weekend and upon check in were told that the non-smoking Park Avenue Deluxe room was unavailable, however they would upgrade us to a Broadway room - but would have to take smoking. This normally doesn't bug me too much, so agreed. However, the room really smelled bad, as did the whole casino. It was kind of a dank ashtray odor that permeated everything. Someone might say: &quot;this is a casino, and you had a smoking room - what do you expect&quot;. My response would be that NYNY was a bit over the top. This is the first time I can remember being so affected by residual smoke, and ended up having sinus congestion, coughing, and other minor respiratory issues while trying to sleep. These issues would clear up as soon as I walked out of the building. The engineering department needs to work on the ventilation.I can't end this review without mentioning some of the nice positive things. The breakfast buffet at Chin-Chins was really good. The Chinese style eggs, fruits, meats, etc. were excellent. I also loved the foot long hotdogs, and authentic pastrami on rye at the Greenburgs Deli - just like it was made in New York City. I also should mention that the staff of the hotel were very helpful, courteous, and went out of their way to treat the customers with a personal touch."
82,407,"Sep 7 2009 	I Love This Hotel!!!	This hotel is located right in the heart of all of the happening hotels. Check in was very quick. Bed was very comfy and we had a view of the srip with no noise from the roller coaster. This was our second trip to Vegas and once again we had a blast. The first time we came to get married and party and we did just that. This time around we came for our one year anniversary and we got a great deal on our room. The room was on a very quiet floor with a ice maker in the room and the room was very clean. We got 20% off at four of the great restaurants inside the hotel and 25 dollars of free slot play. I especially love this hotel because it's not so big to where you get lost when you walk around. Pool is small, but you can go next door to the Monte Carlo where there is four pools including a lazy river. At check out use your T.V. instead of standing in line, it's fast and easy! As long as this hotel treat my husband and I like a King &amp; Queen, we'll be back everytime!"
83,407,"Sep 7 2009 	New York New York Hotel and Casino	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our first year anniversary from Aug 30- Sept 4. It was our first time in Las Vegas so we didn't know what to expect. As with all our trips, we checked trip advisor for reviews. There were more good than bad so we decided on the NYNY hotel. We had the time of our lives (so far). The hotels lobby was really nice! We were greeted by a many many slot machines!!! We arrived at 11am which is b4 check in (3pm) so they allowed us to check our bags in a holding area and the receptionist gave us a confirmation number and telephone number to call to see if our room was ready. Our room was ready by 1pm so we picked up our keys and baggage and went to our room.The Room: The Broadway Deluxe room was nice and spacious. We loved the fact that we had a great view of the MGM Grand, the roller coaster, the Excalibur, and more! The only thing that I hated was the TV. The TV was sooooo small.... I mean...ARE THEY SERIOUS!?!?!? The bed was at LEAST 10 feet away from the bed and they had this little (what seemed to be 19&quot;) TV that didnt ALMOST fill the space it was sitting in! My husband and I laughed soooo hard when we got in the bed and turned the TV on... We were gonna buy some binoculars just so that we can see the darn thing! The bathroom was huge and really nice! The water pressure, though, was really low. The bed was really comfortable and thats a plus! The roller coaster was directly outside our room, but it never bothered us one bit!!!The Pool:The pool and hot tub area was nice. The deepest part of the pool was only 4 feet so I didnt like that too much! But it wasn't too crowded. The Rollercoaster:My husband and I checked out the rollercoaster because everyone seemed as if it was soooo much fun! It was more of a headache ride for me personally. It wasn't smooth at all...I mean rollercoasters aren't &quot;smooth&quot; but it was bumpy and caused me to have a headache after it was over... but its something to do!We really didn't spend too much time in our hotel. We were going around to the other hotel around the strip mostly. Though I liked the NYNY and I would probably stay here again, I probably would check out another hotel on my next visit to Vegas. Just to see what else it out there! :) As another traveler wrote, this hotel gave NOTHING free!!! Even the rollercoaster was regular price to hotel guest! I thought that was a little selfish!!!!"
84,407,"Sep 7 2009 	Mixed feelings	This hotel is really average, there is nothing to be highly enthousiastic about. I have stayed in the Stratosphere before and this is pretty much like it. The rooms are fine, but make sure you book a park avenue room and not a skyline room since the skyline rooms were last remodeled in the iron age. We had a spacious room with a giant bathroom, but (although lovely decorated) very uncomfortable bed, the matress was way too firm.The pool is (as said before) too small, another downside is that is located between buildings what makes it impossible to get a little breeze. Being European, I dont really like big portions and lots of meat, but the restaurants in the nyny only provide food like that. To get some decent healthy food you will have to go to the MGM on the other side of the road. At checking in, the woman at the desk will probably ask you to provide a second credit card, but make sure to provide only 1. I made the mistake to give her 2 and a couple of days later i found out that they were both charged to the max. The hotel charged it back but i really didn't appreciate this 'measure against fraud' as the hotel calls it. People should stop complaining about the rollercoaster:it only runs from 10.00am till 00.00am and who goes to sleep before 00.00am in Las Vegas?! And you don't even here the coaster. But to be honest: it's better to spend a little more money and stay in a much better hotel like MGM/Bellagio or the Mirage. You will not regret this!"
85,407,"Sep 6 2009 	OK Place	We came to this hotel as a first-time experience, and we were a bit disappointed. You get a cheap room rate, but nothing is free: you have no mini fridge in a basic room; there are charges to use internet and the gym. The pool is rediculous. It's extremely small, looks like it was added last minute between the parking garage and the hotel. There are minimal lounge chairs, and most of them are reserved as part of the cabanas or special loungers for those who want to pay a fee. Plus, there was a smell of sewage that stuck around the pool.I wouldn't stay at this hotel unless you intend on gambling all the time. There is no way to relax here, and the hotel does everything possible to get you to spend money...If you want a nicer spot that allows you to relax,"
86,407,"Sep 4 2009 	Great Place Great Time Good value!	Pros: Clean room, comfortable beds, easy access to the strip, great staffCons: Long walk to room, Long walk to the monorail.We went to New York New York after spending a night in Downtown at the Plaza. We arrived, checked in, and was immediately asked if we needed anything else. My friend and I wanted to see the Lion King at Mandalay Bay. We asked the front desk about it, and they found us seats at a great price and got us all setup. The walk to the elevators was pretty short as we used the Century ones to get to our room. We were on the 19th floor. The room was on the far end of the building, so the walk was a little far. When we got to the room (Park Ave Premium View), we were amazed. Nice amount of space, great view of MGM Grand, Tropicana, Planet Hollywood, and the coaster. The bathroom was nice, great space, marble flooring. We had 2 queen beds (very comfortable), a desk, 2 chairs, and a nice wall unit for a dresser and tv cabinet. Contrary to other reviews i've read, we didn't really hear the coaster much. could barely head people screaming when it was running. We didn't eat onsite except to grab a cinnamon pretzle from a kiosk near the sky bridges to MGM and Excalibur. It was great. My friend did fairly well on the slots. Checkout was a breeze. I did it on the TV. No issues at all. The roller coaster was amazingly fun, just be warned that you have to go through a long arcade to get to it."
87,407,"Sep 3 2009 	Great hotel great price great location	The NY NY hotel is very nice. Rooms are very clean, modern and stylish. As it was our honeymoon we asked for a nice room and got on in the &quot;Empire State Building&quot; overlooking the Strip which was amazing. The furnitures were very comfortable, the bathroom small but modern and clean. We had a TV, a fridge, air-condition. Internet access was available but you have to pay for it. They also chare your 3$ per day for the phone even if you dont use it. The shampoos, body lotion, soaps of the hotel were very nice and the towels clean and nice. Great things were: the location: you are in the middle of the Strip but you dont hear the noise at night in your hotel room.There is a nice restaurant area in the hotel where you can find all sort of restaurants in a nice Greenwich village atmosphere. Fish at the fish and chips shop was just great and so fresh... :-) Prices are ok, you can eat cheap or very expensive it is up to you.There is a pool but it looks pretty small, didnt go there.Staff at the hotel was very nice and we felt welcomed. Next time we will stay there again."
88,407,"Sep 3 2009 	Great Hotel with Great Rooms	This hotel is in a wonderful location. It is next to other casinos and shopping. It is an vibrant location. We go to Las Vegas about 3 times per year. It is an great escape. We decided to get married during this trip to Las Vegas. The hotel was accommodating with our special requests (see info below). It has wonderful food choices. The ESPN Zone has good food and plenty of TV to watch your favorite teams or ESPN shows. There is a starbucks on the 1st level. The italian food restaruant is tasty and resonably priced (by Vegas standards). The rooms are clean and tasteful. The furnishings are modern and comfortable. We had a Park Avenue Deluxe room. The bathroom is small, but functional. The rollercoaster was outside my beadroom window, but the noise was minimal. it did not cause me to loose any nap time. The casino is loud and fun. Drink service was outstanding. Most of the time i couldn't keep up with our waitress. I would not be anywhere near finished when my next drink arrived. The casino has a good feel to it. It is one of my favorite places to gamble.The staff was friendly and helpful. We left welcome gifts for our wedding guests at the front desk. They were all delivered correctly. We asked for an early check-in so we could go get our marriage license. They were happy to get us a room before 10am.All in all, this is a great hotel. I would recommend it to friends and family."
89,407,"Sep 1 2009 	Honeymoon	This place is really nice... And for the money it was great.. We took our parents with us and it was really affordable. Make sure you check for discounts. Can't wait to go back again... The only thing is we told them it was our honeymoon and they didn't have anything in our room like champagne or some candy, flowers. Just something!!!! But over all it was a wonderful trip for all of us. None of us won any money but we had a great time... Love the Zumanity Show. Great time..."
90,407,"Sep 1 2009 	Great Place to stay!!!	We stayed at New York New York Hotel and Casino on August 20-24/09. We arrived in Las Vegas at 9 am local time, and we were unable to check in until 3 pm. We left our luggage at the Bell Hop Desk, and it was perfect. We toured around Las Vegas for a few hours, and when we returned we checked in with ease, and picked up our luggage in minutes.The Hotel was nice, millions spent on the interior to make it resemble New York. The night club ROK was ok alot of younger people, but that is to be expected i guess. They were running a promotion while we were there, that gave us free entry to the night club and free drinks for the ladies. I think the guys had to pay a $25.00 cover charge to get in.We only ate one meal in the hotel itself, and it was extremely disappointing. We ordered burgers from the &quot;American Diner&quot; in the hotel and it was disgusting!!!!It was very obvious that they did not make it fresh to order, as it was so dry and you could barely choke it down. We demanded a refund, and they reluctantly gave it to us.Only big complaint about the hotel is that there is no buffet.A number of different restaurants, but no buffet.So we only ate one meal there.Our room was clean and comfortable. We had an ice maker right in our room, no coffee maker though. I suppose it is because they want you to go downstairs to star bucks and pay $5.00 for a coffee. A coffee and a muffin was almost $9.00. Casino is huge, we didn't check out the pool at all, as there were too many things to see, in such a short time. Our room was cleaned everyday.FYI, don't leave your change on the night stand, the cleaning lady might think it is a tip!!!I left about $10.00 in change on the night stand, and the cleaning lady took it. It was no big deal. Just a little surprising. LOLCheck out was smooth, and again we left our luggage with the Concierge, as we had to check out at 1 pm and our flight wasn't leaving until 6.A tip for you, you can get a late check out for free.......check out is 11 and just for asking they gave us a late check out at 1 pm."
91,407,"Aug 30 2009 	Tight Slots but good service 	Hi, We just came back from Las Vegas, our stay was at NYNY, had rental car so we were able to drive to all the different hotels and play there too. Everything was great at NYNY, however we were disappointed with the choices of slot machines. Our favorite is Wheel of Fortune, which we found at other hotels. Slots at NYNY we found were very tight, not to many of our favorites there, like the quarter Top Dollar, they had dollars which is 3.00 a pull, some spin and win, really didn't find any favorite to play. MGM has the wheel of Gold, which is like WOF. It would be great if they brought the Wheel of Fortune back, I'm sure it hurts them. In the other hotels you have to wait for people to get off, they are the most popular slot.Restaurants were great! Accomodations were great!"
92,407,"Aug 30 2009 	Fab hotel!	Stayed here for two nights on the 28th floor of the &quot;Century&quot; block. Biggest room of whole holiday (there were 5 of us), clean and fantastic views from our double aspect room. Location of New York, New York was great and the Boys enjoyed the roller coaster ride on the outside of the building (this was half price to residents between 11am and 12pm.) Only negative comment is that there was no information book for visitors in the room with details of where to eat or which floor the pool was on etc"
93,407,Aug 29 2009 	Celebrated My Husband's 30th at NY NY	The NY NY is a very neat hotel. I really liked how it was set up like NYC. There are tons of places to eat in this hotel. The only thing I didn't care for was the pool. If you are looking for a hotel with a nice pool this hotel is not for you.
94,407,"Aug 27 2009 	Excellent value for money	A very friendly front desk attendant upgraded us to a beautiful room with an extremely spacious bathroom on a high floor, which gave us fantastic views over Las Vegas. Having spent the next night at the much more expensive Venetian Hotel, I can honestly affirm that what you get at the New York New York is excellent value for money, no big difference with higher class hotels that cost three times as much. Would definitely stay there again!"
95,407,"Aug 25 2009	Good Budget Fun Place to stay in Las Vegas	My niece &amp; I stayed her for three nights about 2 weeks ago. We were on the 10th floor in the New Yorker tower and as we had booked this trip through United Airlines Vacations we were upgraded to a Park Avenue room. The room was very clean &amp; spacious with two double beds, room safe, TV, MP3 player plug-in and a view overlooking the MGM Grand and part of The Strip. The bathroom had a bath with shower attachment and solid sliding shower doors on the bath - pressure to the shower was very good and all the usual toiletries were provided as well as ample towels &amp; face cloth. There was a vending macine and ice point on our floor and an ice bucket was provided in our room. Wi-fi and hard wired internet was available although you didi have t o pay for this. No complaints about the room at all - we were very comfortable during our stay although we did not spend too much time in it - just showering between various tourist visits and for sleeping. The rest of the hotel was a real WOW factor for us - being our first time in Las Vegas we were absolutely gobsmacked with the entrance, the casino and the decor throughout. We really felt as if we were part of the gambling capital of the world and it exceeded all our expectations. The choice of dining within was very good - posh or fast food - make your choice and the prices were very reasonable. The Italian restaurant IL FORNAIO was so good that we ate there for two evenings - the second time after we had been through the Excelsior and Luxor looking for something to eat but nothing appealed. The food and service was exceptional and although there was a queue on both nights to get in - this moved very fast.The pool area was well kept and big enough. The casino had a good variety of slots and other gambling available and was very lively.Our check-in went very smoothly and we did not have to wait long at all (it was a Monday that we checked-in) and the reception staff were always very helpful when we asked any questions.We used the ground transport service (SHOWTIME) which you will see as soon as you go out of the arrivals door onto the airport concourse - there are several ground transport companies there. We booked a return ticket with them as it was slightly cheaper to do so - you call them back when you check in to your hotel to arrange your return pick-up time; we had trouble getting through to them because they had a fault on their phones but eventually we did get through and the chap I spoke to was very curtious and booked our return with no problems at all. I beleive that if there are more than 2 of you travelling it is cheaper to get a taxi - we paid about USD 15 each for our return fare.I cannot think of anything negative to say about New York New York - the location is very good, rooms are clean and staff very friendly."
96,407,"Aug 24 2009 	Nice Hotel 	We stayed at New York New York - and were pretty much impressed by everything. Unfortunately, they couldn't accommodate our entire stay - which forced us to move across the street to The Excalibur (which is about as opposite from New York New York as you can get - see our review).- The check in queue, while long, went reasonably quick.- Our room was spacious, clean, modern, and quite honestly more than we expected. We overlooked the pool area and the roller coaster.- The hotel is a smoking establishment (like all the casinos on the strip). So, if you have sensitivities to the smell of smoke, Las Vegas might not be a place you should consider.- The pool was spacious, clean, and guarded. Plus, you get access to the Monte Carlo pool as well (must be owned by the same group).- The restaurants, pubs, bars, and other eating establishments in the hotel are a bit pricey (but it's that way it is in any of the hotels).- Parking was ample, covered, and free with quick access to the hotel.- It was reasonably central - next to The Monte Carlo, across the street from MGM Grand, and The Excalibur.- The roller coaster is pretty crazy. And, as a guest of the hotel, you can get a 2 for 1 ride (which saves you about $15).Overall, I'd recommend New York New York as a fine place to stay on the Las Vegas Strip."
97,407,"Aug 24 2009 	Do not stay here. Go elsewhere	I stayed two nights previously at the Bellagio for business, and extended my stay to see Zumanity which is why we stayed at New York New York. Checkout at NYNY is 11AM. Our flight was at 2. We inquired at checkin about checking out 1 hour late and told it shouldn't be an issue to call the day of. We were also offered an upgrade for $55 of a room with a hot tub. The room was OK. Since we had just been at Bellagio, it was a let down, but that was to be expected. When we called down the next morning to request a 1 hour late checkout we were told no. I went to the front desk to checkout at 11am and was told by Deanna, the manager that, &quot;I obviously didn't understand her housekeeping issues.&quot; She further explained that they had an expected arrival for the next guest of 12PM and the room would not be ready for them. I asked what check-in time was for the hotel and she stated 3PM. Bottom line is the priority was to get the next guest in before the check in time rather than giving me a late check out. I have traveled quite a bit and often request a late check out. I have never been denied a late checkout when it was requested for a single hour. Additionally, the elevators are painfully slow and the food is not great."
98,407,"Aug 22 2009 	NYNY is a great place to stay!	The only thing lacking here is the food choices...I think they could improve on that...otherwise, the casino floor improvements are great, the rooms are nice and the view has always pleased us...love the location, the atmosphere and the fact that MGM is a short walk away."
99,407,Aug 20 2009 	Very good memories	Spent a nice moment in this hotel. The pool is a bit small compared to Mandalay Bay; but we were completely swallowed by NY mood.
100,407,"Aug 19 2009 	Does what it says on the tin.	Arrived after a trans Atlantic flight - check in really smooth and fast (Saturday evening). Hotel fulfilled our expectations of a Las Vegas resort - although no tea or coffee making facilities in the room was rather dissapointing (especially as the coffee we could get in the hotel was poor). Did have a fantastic Turkey Club Sandwich from Greenburgs (?) Deli. Room on the third floor round the corner from the lift - no issues with noise at any time.Got to the pool early, so no issue with loungers - pool was in shade for a good two hours (which is nice when it is roasting)Didn't gamble (I know, strange!) so couldn't comment on the tables."
101,407,"Aug 19 2009 	Honeymoon in Vegas	Stayed 2 weeks in Vegas which was no where near long enough. People said we were mad for going for so long but already in process of returning in 2010. 1st 5 nights was at stratosphere, the last 8 nights were at NYNY.Can not find any faults with this place. The room was nice with a strip/rollercoaster view. Staff were friendly rooms well serviced. Toilet was blocked when we arrived at the room but was fixed within minutes of calling the front desk.Awesome location in relation to the strip.Loved Coyote Ugly and the Piano bar, and sampled some of the food.Had breakfast a few times at (name escapes me) the place with the giant map on the roof. Awesom food and service.Thank you to staff at NYNY for assisting in a great stay on our Honeymoon and first trip out of Australia. Willl deffinatly be back"
102,407,"Aug 17 2009 	First time - not last	People, people, why in the world would anyone take small children to LV??? Please look at the faces of these small creatures at 1am while you are dragging them thru a casino. If they look bored, then you should have taken them to Disneyworld. Save LV for an adult weekend and leave the kids with grandma.Traveled midweek with 5 others. first time at NYNY - wonderful room - don't remember the tower. view of a roof and roller coaster. roller coaster sounded like thunder at night or maybe an airplane taking off from airport - no big problem. halls quiet and no noise from other rooms. elevator wait was minimal. tables were wonderful - won big on 2 different ones. all dealers were friendly and helpful. drink service was good - after you tip $5 the first time, they come back often for another big tip. tip $1 then another 5 - still cheaper than buying the bar drinks. Rooms cleaned very well each day, leaving $10 tip for maid.i sunburn easily, so i don't do pools. ate at nine fine irishmen - wonderful food all around. tried itilian/french - too foo foo for me but others enjoyed it. chin chin buffet - very good, great price but limited selection. Charged food to room and was comped. They dont comp the tip on your tabs, so that was charged to credit card. They also dont comp gift shop purchases. Ask first if youre not sure.stay away from the criss angel show at luxor at any cost. we had free tickets and they still weren't worth it. cheesy at best.easy access to MGM and Excalibur. both casinos good and you can find $5 tables at almost all the casinos on the strip early or very late. It is a far walk to any other casinos, but it doesnt matter where you stay, its just a far walk especially in 105 degree heat.Timeshare people only approach couples, if you see them, separate and they will leave you alone.Wonderful first stay and definitely will be back."
103,407,"Aug 16 2009 	Best Vegas Hotel	My husband and I spent our 6th wedding anniversary at the New York New York Hotel and Casino and had a GREAT time. The staff was very friendly and the restaurants were AMAZING. As a matter of fact Chin Chin (chinese restaurant) was by far the BEST chinese food I have ever eaten. The gambling was pretty high ($10 minimum at the let it ride table) but that is expected at the larger hotels. Our room was on the 21st floor and had a view of the pool and the roller coaster just outside our window and although the coaster ran quite a bit through the night, we didnt hear a thing. I have stayed at other hotels where you can hear what the people in the next room are watching on TV and I have to say I heard NOTHING through the walls. I actually thought we were the only ones staying on that floor until we passed the neighbors in the hall one night. Because we do stay out late in Vegas, having a quite hotel room is extremely important to me and the NYNY hotel definately gave us peace. My only complaint was that there are not enough lounge chairs by the pool and if you want to rent the reserved chairs it costs $60 a day, but other than that I have nothing bad to report about this hotel. I highly suggest staying there and the price was affordable. I know I will stay there when I go back."
104,407,Aug 16 2009 	Best Casino in Vegas!	Loved this hotel. Very quiet upstairs but so much going on downstairs!
105,407,"Aug 16 2009 	Not as bad as previous reviews but not great	They seriously need to recruit some check-in staff. Huge queues to check in and when we got there and eventhough we booked a non smoking room 4 months ago and it was a Monday, there was apparently not a no smoking room available in the whole hotel! In the end we got a smoking room which didnt actually smell of smoke, but bad impression made. Rest of stay uneventful. Needless to say, we used the TV online check out to get out. Good 2 for 1 on the rollercoaster for guests. Pool OK."
106,407,"Aug 14 2009	Amazing hotel	the hotel was amazing the rooms were very clean , you have a great variety of food from all over the world , didnt hear the casino in the room , very clean lift's ect , very helpful staff , good value for money ."
107,407,"Aug 11 2009 	Lovely hotel with a perfect location value for money!	My husband and I decided to go for a 5 night break to Las Vegas and wasn't sure where to stay as this was the first time we were visitng sin city. I definetly made the right decision in choosing this hotel and bagged a bargain booking directly with the hotel. When we arrived we were welcomed with smiles at reception and as it was our anniversary the hotel kindly gave us a room that was spacious and on level 26 giving us views to admire of Las Vegas. Our rooms were cleaned daily by the maid and beds were made up to, the only thing that lacked in the Broadway Room was there were no Tea/Coffee Facilities or a Mini Bar to get a quick drink or snack to eat. The bathroom was nice and clean and also had a powerful hairdryer that I didnt need to take with me. Also you can use the room telephone to ring local numbers and will not be charged any extra as you already pay $3.00 per night compulsory.The food at the hotel was awesome, one of the nights we had an italian and I have not tasted anything like it before, we also ate at a burger place and enjoyed the amazing food - if you want something cheap and cheerful then there is a place within the hotel that is open till 3am it does the biggest, freshest and cheapest pizza's ever. So thumbs up to the food in the hotel too.The location was perfect for my husand and I as we were at the top end of the main Strip and had the MGM Grand Hotel, The Excalibur, Luxor and Mandaly Bay around us and then each evening we use to walk down the strip to get to Ceasers Palace, Bellagio, Venetian Hotels and many more. The New York New York Hotel is breathtaking itself as it has tall buildings and so much to do just inside as well as outside, the casino is really big inside and they have several bars, shops, and clubs. The pool is fairly busy but in July its too hot to sunbathe so many people do find themselves under some shade or in the pool.We both enjoyed the roller coaster at the hotel so make sure you definetly do this during your stay and visit the Ben and Jerrys own store to enjoy a lovely ice cream.I would advise to take light clothing in July, plenty of Suncream and sunglasses, it is very hot, the tempertaures were around 46 degrees each day.Also you can make Las Vegas as cheap as you want or expensive as you want so just spend with your means and you will still have a fatastic time.You won't make a mistake booking this hotel as my husband and I enjoyed our stay and would definetly go back."
108,407,"Aug 9 2009 	Perfect Location!	My boyfriend and I stayed at NYNY for 4 days and really enjoyed it. This hotel was literally 2 minutes outside of the airport which was a bonus!!! We loved the building structure outside with the lovely colours, statue of liberty was breathtaking, and the roller coaster that surrounded the hotel is massive. We flew in on a Thursday so check in at the front desk was a breeze as weekends tend to be busier. We were given a coupon book with many savings discounts that included 2 for 1 roller coaster ride, 2 welcome cocktail drinks etc.We had a really nice park avenue room on the 18th floor with the view of the parking lot which we didnt mind as we werent going to be in our room as much. The size of the room was pretty adequate. The king size bed was comfortable, room and washroom was super clean. Elevators was far from our room so we couldnt hear people coming and leaving from all hours of the night however there was a little bit of noise from the roller coaster tracks which was not an issue.The casino had a great atmosphere with high ceilings that allowed the smokey air to travel. It was bright and huge. The music keeps you grooving. The pool was refreshing for hot afternoons. It wasnt as big as I thought it would be. There were a lot of sun chairs to sit in and was never too crowded. You dont have to worry about bringing your own towels as they have some available for you.There was a variety of cafes and restaurants in the hotel. We tired the Italian and Spanish restaurants -both were amazing. We went to Excalibur one day for the all day all you can eat buffet for $25 dollars. It was okay. We tired the buffet in the Bellagio which we found to be a bit pricey. There were so many places to dine  make sure to try everything!!!!Transportation was not a problem at all. You can hop on a double decker bus that runs along the strip for $3.50 one away or $7 - 24 hr all day pass. The monorail is accessible behind the mgm grand and runs a 7 station route for $13 one day pass or $5 single ride. We saw cirque du soliels zumanity. It was very erotic and worth every penny. The shark reef in Mandalay bay was very interesting there were lots of exotic fish and sharks. The Paris Eiffel tower is a must see. The view from up there is very memorable. We didnt go to any clubs. Most places were charging $30 per person to enter not including drinks.Check out is at 11 am but you have the option of leaving your bags in the storage room if you have a later flight. There is no extra cost for this. Just make sure to tip the storage keeper. There is a standard fee of $3 per night for local calls. This will automatically go on your bill whether you use the phone of not. The weather in July was unbearable. It was stifling hot during the day, dry and humid at night. Pack a bottle of water everywhere you go. Bring lots of sunscreen and walking shoes. This hotel is on the south end of the strip. It is perfect as you can start from where you are and walk up towards the middle and back to other side of the strip. Perfect location!!! Overall it was a fabulous experience. I would definitely return. 4 days is not enough. Las Vegas is truly fun. Lots to see and lots to do."
109,407,"Aug 9 2009 	15 Year Anniversary Celebration	NEW YORK NEW YORK was a fun place to stay. The location was good if you plan on walking the strip. The set up is lively with plenty of restuarants &amp; gift shops. Downside was the pool closing at 7:00pm. Guess they prefer you spend your time in the casino. This was disappointing since even tho we live in Tampa, Fl with a beach 10 miles away, we wanted to enjoy the pool in the evening &amp; just relax with some drinks &amp; no worries. Checking in was nerve-racking due to the fact that we arrived at 11:00pm, there were about 20 people in line to check in &amp; only 2 people at the front desk! Our reservation was made a month in advance but we ended up in a room with 2 queen beds instead of 1 king. The room was very cramped. We finally got a different room the next day, which was a little better. Our stay was good once we got settled. We had a view of the strip, which was quite a beautiful sight at night. Overall, we enjoyed our 4 day stay, renewing our vows, celebrating 15 yrs.of marriage."
110,407,"Aug 9 2009 	Nonexistent customer service at check in/front desk Nightshift	Arrived at 1am, 1 desk clerk working, she was busy &quot;texting&quot; behind the counter....after being given an occupied room, opted to stay at MGM even with my room paid for at NY NY. Manager stated no rooms available at NY NY with the exception of the occupied one...no thanks. MGM was great, hated to drop the extra $100, but had to sleep.Summary, had reservation and confirmation #, yet still ended up with no room.Had to drop an extra $100 at MGM to sleep there...Once back at NY NY the following day, had great service and decent room thanks to dayshift front desk clerk named &quot;MARY&quot; she is the only reason we even stayed."
111,407,"Aug 9 2009 	Above average is expected	The New York New York in my opinion is an average hotel in Vegas. I've stayed at quite a few of them and it doesn't really merit writing an exceptional review. We were on a lengthy road trip, extremely tired, and in the mood for cheap food. We got our room for $99/night, and slept for 17 hours when we first arrived. We spent two nights here, the hotel in general is typical in my opinion. Nothing stands out. I would suggest staying here for the cheap(er) food &amp; having a roller coaster outside isn't all that bad either."
112,407,"Aug 7 2009 	A fun place to stay.... so Las Vegas	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in September of 08. The place was what one expects from Vegas; fun, lively, entertaining. If I was paying it probably would have been a little expensive but luckily I was there on business. The hotel is great for pretty much anyone but more oriented towards familities. The pool is a little small for Vegas standards and the bar scene wasn't great. Also as is typicaly for a casino the pool and fitness rooms close early (around 6pm I think).The casino floor is great and there are lots of cute little shops and fun things to do inside of the casino (like a roller coaster=$15/ride). But this hotel is a little far up the strip - close to the Excalibur and MGM Grande also a but of a hike from the closest train stop as well. If I was going back I'd probably try to go for one of the other casinos like the Palms or even Caesars as they have better shopping, are mid-strip, and have cooler bars."
113,407,"Aug 4 2009 	Fun Hotel	Had a good time at this hotel.There are plenty of eateries in the casino area. The hotel itself is at the end of the strip, but still within walking distance of everything.My room was in the New Yorker tower with a view of the back and the start of the roller coaster"
114,407,"Jul 31 2009 	A fun hotel and casino with great food options.""	My wife and I stayed at NYNY and I really enjoyed it. I'd previously stayed at MGM Grand and TI (Treasure Island), and NYNY was equal to or better than those two (and I have nothing bad to say about either one!).We came for a wedding of 2 friends, and many of their other friends also stayed at NYNY, and this is how it really shined. It's many restaurants and bars offered us ample meeting places.ESPNZone became our de facto headquarters, and I enjoyed great food and drink at Nine Fine Irishmen. 24 Pour offered a good beer selection 24 hours a day, and the Bar at Times Square was a fun piano bar to hang out at.. Even the pizza we grabbed from a stand on the casino floor was excellent and we enjoyed a great late-night meal at &quot;America&quot;, its 24-hour restaurant. (I highly recommend the Mac &amp; Cheese)The casino staff seemed very friendly, particularly at the sports book, where they took the time to explain to us how the odds worked and to bet against the spread.Our room was attractive but unspectacular, but was comfortable and very clean. We had a view of the roller coaster and worried about noise. It was not an issue for us, though I speculate it may have been noisy for patrons further down our floor.The casino has a very nice fitness center attached to its spa. It's $20/day to use, comparable to or cheaper than the gyms at the other Vegas hotels I've been to. Discounted multi-day passes are available, and I believe it's included if you purchase spa treatments. Selection of fitness/weightlifting equipment was very good and the treadmill I used was nice. Temperature of the fitness center was a bit high for my personal comfort level.NY NY's only real drawback, in my opinion, is its location near far south end of the Strip. If you plan to spend most of your time at NY NY, Excalibur, MGM Grand, Luxor, Monte Carlo, and Mandalay Bay, it's perfect. Be prepared to hike or take cabs or the monorail from MGM if you prefer things in the middle or north end of the strip.Overall, we had a great experience with this hotel and casino, and I would definately consider it for future Vegas trips, especially if going as part of a larger group."
115,407,"Jul 30 2009 	Nice but at a price	Stayed here about 5 nights. Hard to fault it really - it has similar weaknesses to other resorts on the Strip I think.The room was well furnished with quality furniture and a nice comfy yet contemporary theme to it. The bathroom was decorated nicely. Housekeeping did a good job keeping the room clean.I did order room service a few times. The pricing is a little steep (no suprise there) but I guess my complaint would be the portions were too large. I'd have been happier if they charged me less and got less as a result.The two things I really didn't like though:Long queues at reception to either check in or out (although from what I hear this is common at most resorts on the Strip).No self-service laundry on siteNo good coffee to go (Starbucks is not good enough even with double shots of espresso!)The staff at the counter and the porters were professional - some more friendly than others. I regret not giving a bigger tip to the bellhop who helped me, had I known he was the exception. Sorry!"
116,407,"Jul 29 2009 	Loved it!	Stayed at New York New York with a friend and loved it. The rooms are very big. modern and exceptionally clean. Towels, sheets and amenities were all replaced daily. There are plenty of places to eat in the hotel but it's always best to venture out and try other hotels. Location wise, it is toward to south end of the strip but within easy walking distance of everything. The monorail also goes from MGM which is across the road.Can't wait to go back for another trip soon...."
117,407,"Jul 28 2009 	Great theming good room over crowded public areas of hotel	Decided to stay at the New York New York due to the interesting architecture, ambiance of the casino, and theme of the hotel. Further it was a reasonable price for the room (mid-pricing level for the strip). We stayed for 7 nights so I our experience was a bit longer than most. So first the good:Whoever said the walk from the parking deck was long must have been 90 and carrying an oxygen bottle. It was EXACTLY 100 paces from the vestibule of the parking deck (entrance to ENCLOSED walkway is on 3rd floor of parking deck) to the actual hotel and another 30 paces to the escalator which drops you right next to the registration desk. Registration was quick (Friday afternoon, approx. 3PM PST) and effortless. They had all the right information, including the rate and gave us a room on the 20th floor of the Century Tower (closest tower to the registration desk, I might add). Room 2077 was a bit far from the elevators, but they'd asked us what we wanted and I chose to be farther away from the noise of the elevators. And it was QUIET! The room (Park Avenue room) was no better/bigger than you would get at a Courtyard, but we also didn't pay more than you would at a Courtyard. Room was clean, smoke free (requested), appointments were appropriate and comfortable, and maid service was EXCELLENT! Despite not getting enough shampoo towards the end of my stay, they were quick, polite, and very courteous. We called for a 2nd blanket the first day and it was delivered within 10 minutes. I'd say that the &quot;hotel&quot; part of the property is fabulous! As for two restaurants worth mentioning, Greenberg's deli was great for lunch and Scirraco's pizza was awesome (even for a Chicagoan who loves his deep dish!).Dueling Pianos at Times Square was fun! Rollicking good time! I'd suggest paying the extra $$ to get preferred seating if you plan on being there a long time. Now for the bad:The other restaurants are overrated and have very odd hours (can't get a donut at Stadium Snacks until after 11AM??!?!?). Hotdog stand not open late to get a quick dog, nachos, or pretzel. The breakfast buffet at Chin Chin's was very VERY disappointing! Very small selections, no omelet bar, pastries were VERY stale; not a deal at $16 per. Il Fornaio (shop, not restaurant) was okay for something quick (bagel, croissant) but not great. ESPN Zone was terrible. No other way to describe it (if I wanted a microwaved hamburger, I'd have done it myself!). Chin Chin's (dinner) was a glorified (and expensive) Panda Express, and the waiter could have cared less whether we were there or not. America is adequate for breakfast, but pass for all other meals (soup was COLD!).The pool is SMALL!!! I MEAN SMALL!!! DID I MENTION THE POOL IS VERY SMALL???Other than the hottub, no other amenities at the pool except for a volleyball net spanning the middle, making it difficult for anyone to do laps. It's also mostly shaded, not much sun hitting the pool area. Note that they post that no outside food/beverages will be allowed, however I brought (4) small bottles of water in with us and nobody gave me any grief.The casino has nice atmosphere (open, high ceilings so you don't feel claustrophobic) and unique design. Sports TV's over each table is nice touch. Cocktail waitresses come by often when playing at the tables (not so much at the machines). Dealers, however, were quite rude, not caring whether you were there or not. Not fun (Excalibur Blackjack dealer-Jimmy....HE was fun!!!). Didn't tip too often (despite playing Pai Gow for about 6 hours one night).Shopping stinks unless you want Harley gear or cheap Vegas souvineirsOne word sums up the NYNY, however: CROWDED! &quot;Streets&quot;/aisles are too narrow to get around without bumping into EVERYONE! By day 5, couldn't take it anymore. (Why would you put a post for the roller coaster right in the middle of two popular food stands and on the way to the main bathrooms?!!??) Way too many people crowding into that place. Need to figure out some crowd control/traffic control.Overall: Hotel good. Casino: Overcrowded Restaurants: Poor"
118,407,"Jul 28 2009 	Nice Hotel - thin walls	Having stayed here once before, we figured we would do it again. The first time, we had a Park Ave room and this time we got a Broadway Deluxe room which is supposedly nicer than the other. One issue was the bedding. The bed was not as comfy as the one in the Park Ave room nor was the bedding. I just expected more but I guess because we paid a lower rate, we got a non-renovated room. Second issue was that we were about a 5 minute walk from the elevator...but that happens in Vegas sometimes. My biggest issue is the THIN walls. Some people next to us were having some sort of party - from what they were saying it was possibly an orgy. We couldn't believe what we were hearing. Then it got quiet so we went back to sleep. At 3:00 am it started back up and then got quiet again. Third time - 5:00 am - I finally called the desk and they sent someone up. It's not the hotel's fault that this goes on but it seems that the walls shouldn't be so thin as to hear EVERY word someone is saying in another room. I thought we were getting a better room than the Park Ave. We never had that sort of experience in the Park Ave. room so IF we ever stay here again, we will not ask for the B'Way Deluxe. I would probably still recommend the hotel but only in certain areas of the hotel. Other than the room the casino is great - we love it there - and Sirocco's Pizza is fabulous. They have all sorts of little eateries downstairs that won't break the bank and they have the easiest self-park of any other Vegas hotel I've stayed at. Plus they are at the end of the strip so you won't sit through too much traffic to get there."
119,407,"Jul 26 2009 	Hotel in good location on strip with Great Rooms and facilities	We had a whole group of people stay here in April 09. While we did not get rooms near each other and some were on different floors. We soon organised a central meeting place for when we were hanging out together. The rooms are fantastic!! Large, with everything you need. Every room seems to have a different view. We used the Deuce bus a lot for getting down the strip. While it was slow, we found that was sometimes helpful as we got talking with people and they gave us tips on what they liked and did not.Recommend - Sunset helicopter flight over Grand Canyon. Quicky Wedding Ceremony under Las Vegas sign. (was quick and painless)"
120,407,Jul 24 2009 	Fabulous	Fab hotel - must go on the roller coaster.central hotel on the main stripvisit the piano bar inside the hotel.Pay 1 dollar and the guy will play anything you want to listen to( drinks can be expensive but they do great cocktails).The apple bar is a great bar to visit inside the hotel with a live band playing..
121,407,"Jul 24 2009 	new york new york hotel las vegas	Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights and initially disappointed with the quietness down the bottom end of the strip, however, the hotel itself was full of fun loving happy people who were there to have a good time! Four of us travelled to Vegas and stayed in one room, which was big enough for all four girlies to get ready! The American Bar/Diner serves good food and is pretty cheap for beer compared to other places and has a happy hour. The Irish Bar inside was very quiet, expensive and even though most of the tables were empty we were told we couldn't sit down and had to stand at the bar with our drink! Apparently the tables are for diners only!! We went to the Grand Canyon for one night and then came back to Vegas and had 3 nights in the Bellagio, which I must say was in an excellent position in the middle of the strip but it lacked the fun of the New York New York and we all wished that we had stayed there!!!! Vegas is a must do trip but it's all hotel based and can get tedious walking from each of them. The roller coaster ride at the New York New York is expensive both you have to do it."
122,407,"Jul 23 2009 	Mixed Reviews. Casino Atmosphere A+  Rooms Subpar	Stayed at this Hotel twice. Both times they offered from upgrade to Park Avenue room. For some reason I always wound up with SMALLEST room on floor. Due to the shape of the facade on the outside the hotel has a weird shape inside. Also of note is that some rooms have a pink covering over the windows to distort your view. This to make the exterior look nice but not from the inside. Had to change my room twice because of issues. Overcharged my credit card and could not refund my money. Had to wait nearly a week before charge came off. Very small rooms.On the plus side the casino is very nice. Has a nice atmosphere and usally the play is very good. Nice places to eat such as Gonzalez Y Gonzalez and Nine Fine Irishman. You will be HARRASSED by Consolidated Resorts trying to sell you a time share at Tahiti Village. There freebies are bogus and they are relentless. They are all over NYNY, Monte Carlo and Tropicana. DO NOT GET SUCKERED in. I made that unfortunate error on my first visit to Vegas."
123,407,"Jul 22 2009 	Good Hotel	This was my first time at this hotel and I had a pleasant stay. I chose the Park Avenue room which is the level above the regular room. The room was spacious, clean, and the personnel was kind and helpful. It is a good value only if the price is below $100/night because better deal at better hotels are available if the price is above that level."
124,407,Jul 21 2009	worst hotel ever never stay here	Hi I just thought everyone should know never to stay at this hotel. It was the worst service I have ever experienced. We booked 3 rooms total. The first thing that happened was the quote that we booked this hotel at was wrong and it took forever to figure out so the first hour of our trip was spent at the front desk. When we finally got the keys the room that one of us went to was in the basement! All the windows were blacked out and it felt like a prison. So we went back up to trade rooms they gave us another room but when we got there it was dirty! So we went back down and they said that they would clean it but that it would take 2 hours. So we waited 2 hours and when we went back up it was still dirty! They did upgrade the room but we basically wasted a good amount of time dealing with this. The second thing that happened was in our room. We had gone to bed late but were awakened at 8am by drilling and hammering above our room. We tried to sleep through it but it was ridiculous so I called the front desk to ask them to stop because we were sleeping she told us she would take care of it. It stops and then starts again after 5 minutes. They didn't even give us a call to let us know what was happening! Long story short we got compensated one day and moved rooms. This would've been good but when we went down to pay for the rooms they charged us more for the rooms then they quoted like $30 more per day per room because they average the room rates. Also the third room we got did not lock properly and we also passed people in the hall whose room keys did not work and had to go down to front desk to have it fixed.If you want a comfortable relaxing vacation DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
125,407,"Jul 17 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location	I stayed at the New York New York for 3 nights and I was very impressed with the service and the room. We were given an upgrade (even though they 'don't give complimentary upgrades') because one of my friends was celebrating her new singlehood and the room was great. I was not pleased, however, with the lack of a coffee maker in the room. I have never heard of a hotel room without a coffee maker, but I guess the hotel wanted us to shell out $3 for a cup of coffee in the casino food court area. The location was perfect, and the club in the casino (Rok) put us on the list and gave us wrist bands for free drinks until 12:30 because we were celebrating. The hotel and its employees were not pretentious and overall we had a great time. However, the drink service in the casion was awful. We had to wave down a waitress every time, and they only came over to us 1 out of 5 times. One round of drinnks was great, but the second time our gin and tonics were pure tonic and were not worth the $4 tip we gave our waitress."
126,407,"Jul 13 2009	New York was great for us!	My daughter and I spent three nights at New York New York. We had a Park Avenue room on the 31st floor of the Century Tower. Our room was clean and bathroom was spotless. Each day our room was cleaned perfectly...they even arranged the shoes I had left on the floor in a nice row. We could hear the rollercoaster in the distance, but it stopped at midnight. It never bothered us at all. We ate Il Fornaio for breakfast two mornings...once at the restaurant and once at the take out. Both were great experiences. The coffee was strong and delicious. The service was excellent. We found the location to be handy. The Deuce bus stopped very nearby, and we used it quite a bit. We would certainly stay here again."
127,407,"Jul 12 2009 	Will Not stay again	My wife and I stayed there on our first ever trip to Las Vegas. Our room was $114.00 a night for small room and small/UNCLEAN bathroom. The towels were like sand paper. We had to pay a $3.00 a day phone charge for a phone I did not use one time I was there. So, for $114.00 a night we got a room and all there &quot;accomodations&quot;. Accomodations being this, a small pool, only 4 feet deep, just in the middle where there was a Volleyball game going on all the time so you could not get to it. So I had to swim in the 3 feet deep part of the pool. The pool and hot tubs were dirty. There were leaves in all of the hot tubs. The pool is only open from 9a.m. to 7 p.m. in June and July, only open to 7pm. Other accommodations, a work out room that you had to pay $25.00 a day to use or go with out. A casino, I would not call that accommodation. A Roller Coaster that is $14.00 a person for one 3 min ride. $14.00 a day to use the high speed internet in your room or go with out. There are no accommodations at the New York New York. You pay $114 a night for a small dirty room and a small dirty pool. We had drinks at the over priest casino bar, the bar stuff was very rude. They were not the only people of stuff there that were rude. I will never stay there again. There are so many nicer hotels on the strip to stay at in Vegas."
128,407,Jul 9 2009 	Good Hotel In Excellent Location	We stayed here in June 09 and stayed for 4 nights. We were upgraded to a suite as it was our Wedding Anniversary.We found the staff very helpful and the rooms were very good although a little dated when comparing with the newer hotels.Overall we would probably stay here again.
129,407,"Jul 9 2009 	Great hotel prices average accomodations	I can honestly say that this hotel is average. I would mirror the room accomodations as ones that you'd get at a Holiday Inn. The bath towels were like sandpaper; the shower products were cheap, the shower/bathtub needs to be updated (we had water squirting on the ceiling from the head). Check-in consisted of at least 1 person working the desk and at best 3 people...it took longer than your average hotel check-in. We stayed in the Park Avenue Stripview room (and upgrade from the Skyline). Our view was of the roller coaster, Tropicana, and Excalibur. The last time we visited we stayed at the MGM Grand so I think that set the bar pretty high. The tenders at the bar on the floor of the casino were rude; I can't come up with a justification for them being that way...they weren't really busy. Dining this time was like eating at McDonalds versus The Ivy....spend the extra money....when it comes to food cheaper isn't always better. The next time we come we won't stay here; it's not our style."
130,407,Jul 8 2009 	Would Definitely Stay Here Again!	My family and I just returned from a 2 week long road trip vacation to California from Alberta. Our first stop was Pocatello and our next stay was New York New York in Las Vegas. We got a great deal on this hotel and didnt have to pay extra person charges for our daughters which was a real bonus. Our check in was quick and easy and our room was very good. It was quite large in that we could lay out all our stuff and still move around comfortably. Liked the theme and feel of the casino and the look of it especially as we had our daughters (17 and 14) with us. We have no complaints and would definitely stay there again-especially if they continue to waive the extra person fees
131,407,"Jul 7 2009 	Not a hotel I'd stay at again!	Last year we went to the NY NY hotel casino for a week. This was strictly for leisure and fun. The good part about the hotel is the location is on the strip. The bad part is you have a noisy roller coaster going for hours and hours. Let me walk you through our stay... we arrive and ask for a nice room. We are given one but the walls are so thin that I hear the squeaking of the elevator all night. We ask to be moved and I still hear an elevator in another room. Then, I try to upgrade and get a better room hoping the room problem will be solved....nope! The guy at the front desk tells us no need to go look at the room that we will like it. WELL, nice enough he gives us a room RIGHT next to the roller coaster and the lights to light up the hotel are outside our window. So, we spent a bunch of extra money to see a concrete slab and bright lights. I spent the next half hour crying. I've been to Vegas 3 times and this was the worst experience I've ever had. On my other trips I was easily given a wonderful view of the strip at both Treasure Island and Mandalay bay. Also, the room smelled like Eucalyptus or something. I started having major allergy issues that week and after reading another review on here about the carpet stuff they use that caused that person allergy issues, well, I'm not sure I'll ever set foot in that hotel ever again. I laid sick all week in the hotel listening to a roller coaster and people screaming on it. Annoyingly enough, one of the doors that leads to and from the strip have solicitors trying to sell you things. We had a couples massage, but the lady had to lead me in a robe through the workout area, which I didn't care for. Also, there should be a no cell phone policy in the spa. As soon as I started to relax another client walked in and started talking on her cell phone so loud she could have woke the dead. Not my idea of a great stay! In the future I hope that when they tell someone at the front desk that they will like the room....they won't be lying! This was the worst view he could have given us, but we were tired of changing rooms and being unhappy. I try to erase this stay in Vegas from my memory."
132,407,"Jul 7 2009 	good location exciting for young adults good value	Had a pleasant stay, young adults in the family loved the hotel theme and its location. Plenty of food to choose from on site, easy walking to MGM, LUXOR,. Had Booked 2 rooms, requiring one room to have 2 doubles. This was not available at check in, and we were checking in an hour or 2 early and they gave us a free upgrade for this room. It was huge. Good value and location. Pleasant staff at check in. Kayc63"
133,407,"Jul 4 2009 	Very nice would stay again	Our room was very nice with 2 queen beds, plenty of closet and dresser space. The bathroom was clean and roomy. Maid service came in every day and restocked the bathroom, made beds and cleaned. The roller coaster was not overly loud. Check in took a little while because computers were down, check out was smooth, valet wonderful! We stayed for 5 nights and would stay again."
134,407,"Jul 4 2009	Plenty to eat drink and Gamble on but No Poker room	My wife and I, along with my youngest son (24) stayed at NY NY between 17th June - 1st July 2009. We asked if we could have a free upgrade and was told it would cost $15 dollars a day, no joy there then. Asking for a quiet room we got room 603 in the New Yorker Tower. This room was at the back of the hotel, and when I say at the back, I mean at the back. Clean tidy, with a safe but no fridge and views of the Roller Coaster and Car Park. The walk from the Lifts to the room was a seemingly endless slalom through the winding corridor, I read about the Roller Coaster before we booked, people said it was reasonably quiet ... they lied, or were not in or near our room. The Pool area seemed to be in the shade when we wanted to be there, however they have a reciprical agreement with the Monte Carlo and we spent our Pool time there. I wanted to play Poker and could not believe I had booked into a Hotel with no live Poker Room. so once again the benefit was to the Monte Carlo , or across the Skywalk to the MGM Grand. Food was good and varied, didn't gamble much as we found we did that elsewhere after playing Poker. Only for the reasons of no Poker room, and the Roller Coaster I feel I could not wholeheartedly recommend this hotel."
135,407,"Jul 4 2009 	Value not worth the dirt	Our experience started off at this hotel at check in. The line was winding, and their computer system was down. The wait to check in was 45 minutes.The room was on the small side.Entering the small bathroom we found a dried up lime on the floor from whoever stayed prior to us.The floor was dirty, visable dirt in all the corners. Some of the grout on the tiled floor was white, while most was black with dirt.One day the maid left her pink duster on our bed. Was that a hint for us to clean.The temperature in the room was hard to regulate, it was either to hot or to cold.The pool is small and shaded by the buidling, making the pool very cool in the morning. The whirlpools were nice, except they were not working all the time.For the first two days of our stay, there were still having problems with their computer system.So if you just happened to get lucky and win on a slot, the ticket cahs out machines were not working.You had to take the ticket to the cashier, whom complained she had to take care of these.Would we stay here again, NO."
136,407,"Jul 4 2009 	Amazing hotel but could be better	This was my third trip to Las Vegas and I wanted something a little different from the same old, same old hotel, mainly because I was taking a friend who had never been to Vegas before. So, of all the hotel/casino's on the strip, the only one that really stands out is NY-NY!Check in was relatively painless, but then I had already booked one of the best rooms in advanced. The room was fantastic, with a large LCD TV, two huge queen sized beds, a large bathroom with shower, safe and limited cupboard space. The room was attractively decorated in neutral colours and the beds comfortable.The hotel/casino it self is amazing, with a cut down version of New York, with loads of fast food outlets, a few bars (Time Sq is probably the best) and restaurants. However, as the ceiling is painted black, the lighting low and with crazy coloured carpet, it can feel a bit depressing and will make you want to get out and go to another casino after a short time.As NY-NY is at the southern edge of the strip, it is a bit of a walk to get to places such as the Bellagio, but fairly easy at the right time of year.All in all it's not a bad hotel, would recommend it, but don't ask the desk to do anything more than just checking in or checking out, especially if you lose something."
137,407,"Jul 3 2009	My money was stolen!	My husband and I booked a room at NY NY in Las Vegas and decided to change rooms. The room was tiny and we heard the roller coaster constantly. We called the front desk and were given another room. When we left, we forgot our items (jewlery, camera and $600) in the room safe. We remembered 5 minutes after we left and notified the front desk. They told us we had to go down and get a temporary key since our keys would no longer work. My husband went down and they kept him waiting for 30 minutes. They finally told him that they had already checked out the room to someone else and we could not enter the room without the new occupants permission. (no one was answering in the old room). I finally asked to speak to a manager and she told me security would meet me at the room to open the safe. When I got to the room, a desk clerk came running to tell me that security had already opened the safe and my items were at security. When I went to claim them they told me there was no cash, only jewlery and my camera. I complained to everybody but no one listened. I told them security should not have opened the safe without me present, but they said another security person was present. They would not give me any names or explain anything to me. They treated me like a liar and told me they had no liability. They never returned my money. I will never go to this horrible hotel again. The only ones that could have accessed the safe was security since no one else knew the code I had put. Their customer service is awful!"
138,407,Jul 2 2009 	great if your under 30	i am over 30 and found the hotel casino alittle loud the mgm is more my speed if your young and like to party this could be a fun place for you but if your over 30 and looking for a quiet time you might want to look else where
139,407,"Jul 2 2009 	I had a great time!	Arrived at NYNY in the evening. Check in was very straight forward, we were upgraded without asking and at no extra cost which was a nice surprise. Our room had a view of the MGM with the mountains in the background - lovely. The TV was very old, and the selection of channels limited however we weren't there to watch TV so this was a minor comment. The bathroom was clean, large, the shower was ideal (not the pathetic trickle I've experienced in some hotels), and there was plenty of shelf space to store our toiletries.The service at the hotel was great. We had difficulty operating the safe (those who had vacated the room before us had not left it unlocked). We called reception and within 10 minutes someone was up to fix it, including joking with us that we could split the contents (there was nothing in it though!). My bag was delayed and I received a voice message (as I was out of the room at the time of the call) to say that my bag had arrived. I called the baggage desk and again within 10 minutes my bag was delivered to the room. Room service was another pleasant experience (although the charges added were very high - as is the case with most places in fairness). Food was lovely, large portions, and was delivered within 40 minutes (we were advised of this when we ordered).One thing to note is that the hotel is the $21 phone charge that was applied ($3 per day for a 7 day stay). I used the phone three times (to check up on my bag), and obviously there would be a charge for that but it appears this charge applies regardless. $21 is not a big deal, however when you are in Vegas you may have gambled all your money away before checkout!The location of this hotel is not perfect, but its not awful either. There is a bit of walking involved if you want to go to the Mirgage/Ceasers etc (about 30 minutes, but the heat is impactful). There are plenty of air conditioned casinos along the way that you can pop into to cool down. Overall I think this hotel is great, although I would be tempted to stay further down the strip next time.For tourists please note: I looked online into buying tickets for a few shows and the prices were very high. There are numerous &quot;Tickets for Less&quot; booths along the strip that offer great deals. Of the two shows we attended we had great seats."
140,407,"Jul 1 2009 	Turn back time	I usually don't write Trip Advisor reviews for chain or generally well-known hotels since I doubt I can contribute much that hasn't been said, but am reviewing the NY NY in order to note that it appears to have gone slightly downhill in the last few years. I stayed in the NY NY once in 2003 and it was great - exactly on par with the Paris - one of Vegas's really fun &quot;theme&quot; hotel/casinos. I stayed again in 2009 only to find best part of the casino area had been completely ripped out (the Central Park themed bridge and trees) and replaced with abstract gaudy neon swirls and a pit of slot machines. The New York theme was pretty much lost as a result (though once you venture out of the casino area into the restaurant section, the theme becomes evident again with the tenement style buildings, delis, pizzarias, etc.). The rooms are spotless but haven't been updated (e.g., projection TVs). However, the price did reflect this decline (at $79, the room was about $40 cheaper per night than the Paris).As an aside, it seems like Vegas, generally, is moving away from theme hotels/casinos like the NY NY, Paris, Venetian, etc. to just super-luxury (the Wynn, etc) and the action is moving further north on the Strip.The bottom line is the NY NY was a great value (very clean with good location and fair pricing), but it's a bit disappointing to see it starting to decline, even if the price has been adjusted accordingly. By all means, stay there for the value and gamble elsewhere in a more fun/luxurious environment."
141,407,"Jun 30 2009 	Nice but not awesome	Having stayed at 8 or 9 mega casinos over the past couple years I'd have to say NY NY was middle of the pack. Overall clean and comfortable but nothing special. I didn't wait long to check in or out, the people were all reasonbly nice, the casino and bars were fine (though Coyote Ugly was obnoxiously loud and crowded. The free pass to get in was nice.) There just wasn't anything to make me say wow I need to go back. I thought Ghallagars steakhouse was going to be it but it too was just OK. Not terrible but nowhere near Delmonicos at Alladin. The pool is small and noisy with the roller coaster but the wait staff there are nice and prompt. I just wish something made me say WOW!!"
142,407,"Jun 29 2009 	No complaints good value	Our stay at NYNY was very pleasant. We booked through MGM Vacations which included a complementary upgrade to a Park Avenue room (didn't try the $20 trick - from reviews I read online they haven't accepted it in 2009). We were offered to upgrade to a Spa Suite for $50/night extra but declined. The room was sufficient but on the smaller side... can't imagine what their &quot;basic&quot; room is like! I will say the bathroom was amazing. The shower had PERFECT water pressure and a huge sink to spread out all our &quot;stuff&quot;. That was probably the best part of the room! We did mention on our reservation that we were celebrating our 1-year anniversary and without asking received a beautiful south-looking strip view.... basically looking out over the statue of liberty's head. That was a very nice gift from the hotel!We did use the pool one afternoon and had a great time. It's smaller, but not as &quot;basic&quot; as some reviewers make it out to be. I've stayed at the Flamingo two other times, so I can say this is not the best pool, but we were able to get chairs (we went out about 2:30pm...after we'd lost our money for the day!) and were even talked into a game of pool volleyball. Drinks are expensive, but as to be expected (we brought waterbottles of our own mixes, but those ran out before we left). We didn't try the Monte Carlo pool, but overall the area at NYNY exceeded my expectations. We ate three times at the hotel - Americana for breakfast which had good food but was a bit too expensive for our taste (about $40 for two pancakes and two coffees), the Hot Dog shop which was quick and tasty, and the pizza joint, Sirrico's Pizza. This was the BEST value! $17 for a large, doughy pizza which served as dinner one night and breakfast the next (hey! we're young). OH- we also had ice cream scoops at Ben &amp; Jerry's which were huge and a nice splurge to end our vacation.The location of NYNY was just &quot;ok&quot; for us. We spent some time at MGM and Planet Hollywood, which are a quick walk, but the majority of our visit we were farther north (Bellagio, Ceasers, Venetian) and up to Fremont St. Next time we'll stay higher up the strip so we're not spending 40 min walking every time we leave the hotel!"
143,407,"Jun 29 2009 	You've GOT to be kidding!!!!!	Hotel room was hot when we arrived, but it was nice. However when we went down to gamble, I won a $50 jackpot and it took me over two hours to collect my winnings!!! There system was down and they had ONE person paying out winnings with no rhyme or reason or line or method. It was completely ridiculous!!! The casino knew there was a computer problem in the middle of the day, but at 11:30 when I first won they had not made any plans for the circumstances!!! I will never stay again!!!"
144,407,"Jun 28 2009 	great hotel casino	before we went read some bad reviews about thishotel casino,my wife and myself andfreinds thought it was great,staff were freindly rooms clean,every thing you needed wasthere if you did leave the casino afoot bridge took you to the mandalay bay excalibur luxorcasinos,some people must be very hard to please we loved it and would recommend."
145,407,"Jun 26 2009 	We were disappointed!	We stayed at the NY-NY Hotel after receiving an internet offer for an upgraded room at a rate lower than the rates offered at our favorite hotels (Paris, Plazzo, and The Hard Rock). Check-in took about 30 minutes due to only one counter being open. There were approx. 20 people in line when we arrived at 2:00pm, but when the line increased to about 40 people they opened 6 more counters. The room on the 25th floor overlooking the pool was clean, the bed was very comfortable and had a partial view of the Las Vegas Strip. The room could only be described as average, however, being very small with a small bathroom. We could observe the roller coaster from our window, passing by every few minutes, but could not hear it so it was not a problem at night. We also didn't hear any noise from the adjoining rooms that previous reviewers had complained about. We did have a problem both nights with the DRUNKS in the hallways returning to their rooms around 3:00am yelling, laughing, singing, trying to open our door with their cardkeys, slamming doors, and anything else they could do to make sure everyone was awake.  Our major complaint about the hotel was the casino. This hotel, as well as several others seems to have removed the traditional types of slot machines (with bars, cherries, jackpots, etc.) and replaced them with newer video game types of machines. Even if we could figure out how to play these new video machines they require larger bets, so instead of losing 1-3 credits each time, you now can lose 15-375 credits each time. (The casinos switched over their slot machines a few years ago to accepting only currency and not accepting coins).  Our second complaint was the old style television in the room. Also the selection of channels was very limited. (We didn't go to Las Vegas to watch TV, but it would have been nice to have FOX News, and HBO/Showtime movie channels like the hotels provide).  All these changes in the casino caused us to do our gambling at other casinos, thereby causing the NY-NY to lose our business at their restaurants, souvenier shops, shows, etc. We highly recommend the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant at the Paris Hotel. The prices are very reasonable by Las Vegas standards, the food is great, and if you request a table outside on the patio (go after dark, because of the summer heat) you get a great view of the water fountain show across the street at the Bellagio Hotel). One major improvement at the NY-NY (as well as the Paris and the Rio) was that they seem to have gotten rid of the annoying &quot;Time Share&quot; sales people that endlessly harrassed the hotel guests and visitors. We keep hearing how the bad economy is hurting Las Vegas, but the crowds on the sidewalks at night are still there (even during mid-week). Maybe the visitors are staying outside enjoying the free sights, rathering than venturing inside the casinos to try and figure out the new confusing slot machines."
146,407,"Jun 25 2009 	Great stay at the NYNY	We stayed at the NYNY for 4 days and had a great time. Check-in was efficient and the staff was very friendly. We had a Park Avenue room on the 26th floor of the New Yorker tower and it was very clean and quiet. The towels were a bit old, but they were clean. We didn't spend a lot of time gambling in the casino - the space was small compared to some of the others on the strip. The location on the strip is not optimal - you have to walk through a construction zone and past some small seedy strip malls to get to the action in the middle of the strip. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the Times square food court area. We ate at Fornaio and Gonzalez Y Gonzalez - both were good. The Chin Chin breakfast buffet was not bad, but could have had more choices (and the coffee was awful compared to the Fornaio). We checked out the pool one morning - unfortunately it doesn't get the sun until later in the day so we didn't stay there long. There was also a strange sewer smell sometimes (maybe it's near their garbage?), but we seemed to be the only people bothered by this so maybe it depends on which pool chairs you pick. We didn't check out the nightlife there as we tended to be out in the evenings, but the piano bar seemed to be very popular. All-in-all it was a nice hotel and we would probably stay there again."
147,407,"Jun 22 2009 	Enjoyed NYNY but not entirely convinced to come back.	We stayed at Luxor in February and on that trip checked out NYNY and liked its atmosphere so much that we decided to stay there instead of Luxor again in June.

148,407,"Jun 21 2009 	[Relatively] Good Las Vegas Location For Teenagers	Kinda hard to say any Vegas location is &quot;good&quot; for kids, but given the other options, teenagers will have more fun here than anywhere else except maybe the Stratosphere. The roller coaster (pricey, but a good coaster!), amusement area and TImes Square Food Court were good for the kids. Check-in, check-out process was efficient, and rooms were clean and well-appointed.The only down-side we observed was that the hotel room was noiser than necessary. Roller coaster outside room ran till 1:00 AM. Be aware. Free parking garage had plenty of space and a close walk to registration.Price paid - $170 for 2 nights including fees and expenses. Watch out for extra guest fee (beyond 2 people), but this is definitely negotiable! Our extra guest fee would have been $120 ($30 per person per night) had we not negotiated!"
149,407,"Jun 21 2009 	Not bad...fun time	This hotel was fine for the price. Check-in process was average. Room was clean. We had a smoking room...and it definitely smelled like it. No windows for ventilation but being a smoker, we would have to accept that. Used the room only to sleep so didnt need extravagance - it served its purpose. Check out was super easy. Only bad thing i hated was that the doors are loud! you can hear other people's door closing and opening. EVen the bathroom door was loud.The hotel had lost of restaurants and amentities. Pool was small but its Vegas - i did not expect sprawling beaches or huge pool. It was crowded but we never had a problem finding a couple of lounge chairs -just had to look and drag one to the other. Food was good. Again, its vegas so dont expect anything cheap.Casino is FABULOUS. Its the whole reason of going to vegas right? I liked it better than MGM. overall, great time.TIP: get players card if you plan on gambling. You can get good comps like a free meal, free cigarettes, etc. But you have to ask."

151,407,"Jun 18 2009 	Penthouse Suite	Stayed here, with my wife, the first week of January. We had booked this, about 11 months in advance. We reserved one of the Penthouse Suites (NOT the Ziggurat Suites). We stayed on the 33rd floor. Our penthouse unit, was in the shape, of, an upside down &quot;U&quot;. Upon entering the foyer, there is a guest bathroom, off to the right (simply a toilet, and sink). Continuing forward, there is a bar/kitchenette area, and, a sofa to the right. Making a left turn, there is the living room/dining room. Nothing spectacular. Proceeding through a door, and to the left, is the bedroom. In the bedroom, is a jacuzzi tub. Then, there is the master bathroom, which is actually divided into 2 rooms. The shower is amazing. The water pressure on that high a floor, is usually like turning on a kitchen faucet. This shower had NO trouble. Then, there are his/her sinks. Finally, in it's own little separate room, is the toilet and bidet.One of the bonuses to staying in a Penthouse Suite, is the VIP check-in &amp; lounge. Seeing as it was our honeymoon, and, first time to Vegas, the concierges in that lounge were very helpful in getting us limos, tickets to all the Cirque shows, helicopter tours, etc. Plus, since our &quot;VIP Host&quot; made the reservations, we were always allowed on the &quot;VIP&quot; lines, at the other hotels.You can read about the casino in all the other reviews.I'd probably stay here again, but, I doubt I could get another Penthouse Suite (they seem to have withdrawn them, as an option on the reservation site)."
152,407,"Jun 18 2009 	Amazing!	I had been hesitant to stay at this hotel because I thought because of the reasonable prices they may cut back on accomadations. I was so wrong! It was a wonderful experience from check-in, to accommadations, restaurants, entertainment and the rooms. The pricing was great, customer service was excellent, the bars (Nine Fine Irishman highly recommended!) was great. We are going back again in two weeks and have booked with them again!"
153,407,"Jun 18 2009 	Casino with Addictive Atmosphere Great Hotel	Stayed here for 5 nights and although we visited all the other hotels in Las Vegas, we came back here every night to play the roulette table as the casino atmosphere was the best!! The dealers were friendly, chatty and very lucky!! The hotel room was clean and comfortable. We eat in ESPN bar and really enjoyed the food and the cocktails. The location isnt the most central but it is walking distance from all the &quot;top&quot; hotels. It has direct access to the MGM via the footbridge and to the monorail to Mandalay Bay.The pool area was nice, clean and lots of sunloungers. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.We loved Las Vegas and it doesnt matter where you stay as you visit of the other hotels attractions and casinos. Can't wait to go back!!!!!"
154,407,"Jun 17 2009 	What a fun hotel!	This hotel was really great! The casino has a really fun atmosphere. There are tons of cute little shops, and resturants that are built around a New York neighborhood theme, I am a very visual person, and this was just candy to my eyes, all the little nooks and crannies, and things to look at. They also have an arcade upstairs that was really fun. Our room was right by the rollercoaster and we did not have any problem what so ever with the noise. I believe it stops around midnight anyway, and we weren't really in our room before that. The room was nice, we got a complimentary upgrade. It was really big, and the bed was king size. Everything was very clean. The staff was great. I really don't have anything negative to say about the hotel. It is not as big as some of the others (MGM, Ceasars), but it was just right. I never once felt lost. Once you get the layout of the casino, you are good. Now, I have been to Vegas before and stayed at the Mandalay Bay (that hotel was awesome too), but for this price this hotel is one of my favorites. The location on the strip was pretty good too. I would definitely stay here again!!"
155,407,"Jun 14 2009 	Nice hotel	It's not the best hotel in Las Vegas, but it's got a huge charm. Some of the rooms look oldy, but I switched the room after first night into better one...Casino is not the huge one, but it's nice and you can have fun pretty much. Bakeries and bars are just fine...We liked our stay there very much. But, if you are looking for some kind of luxury and have a good deal there, go to Wynn or Encore... Roller coaster, pretzels and cinnemon rolls are great..."
156,407,"Jun 11 2009 	Best BDAY PLACE	I booked two rooms for 2 nights at the NY NY hotel and casino. It was the perfect place to celebrate my 25 bday. The front desk was very nice, we had to wait for the rooms to be cleaned - but they offered us drink vouchers and upgraded our rooms. The best part was that we didnt need to leave the casino - we were 8 of us - and everybody wanted different things/bars/clubs/slot machines - all located under the same roof. NYNY is the perfect place for Las Vegas style partying!"
157,407,"Jun 9 2009 	Awesome!	So I stayed at NY NY May 31st to June 4 and I have to say that this place was awesome. Customer Service was OK, Ive had better. Check- In took about 10min and the front desk clerk was very helpful and efficiant. She gave us a map and told us where everything was. This was my 3rd trip to Las Vegas and I have stayed at Bellagio and Ceasars Palace so I know luxury. I stayed in a Park Avenue Deluxe Strip View room and It was just like the pictures. Very updated and just enough space. We did have a mini fridge in the bathroom and that is one thing that most people said this hotel did not have. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. The casino area is very large and there is so much to see and it can get a bit confusing. But if you follow the signs you will always find what you need. The few places that we did eat were very good. Drinks come very slow when your gambling, I was only asked if I wanted a drink about 3 times my entire stay. The pool is small but there was an abundance of lounge chairs, and if you get out there early enough and try and get a spot on the side of pool opposite of the bar you get great sun around 11am while many other areas get little to no sun. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel. Im planning on staying here again in the next few months. It was completly worth the money that I spent. I hope this is helpful to anybody looking for a cheap, but nice and fun place to stay."
158,407,"Jun 7 2009	Dirty and terrible customer service	Little customer service. Check in lines were huge with people on the desk having no care at all. Handed our room key and the woman quickly spat out directions on where to go. Lobby and casino area particularly dark and unappealing, with a very 'desperate' and 'sleazy' vibe, moreso than the other casino's we visited.Hotel was rundown and halls were dirty and felt unsafe. The carpet behind the 'desk' in the room was filthy and after room service was completed, it felt like beds were made and nothing else was really attended to. Also, walls were extremely thin in the 'New Yorker Tower'....Room came with no hotel map or information... we never even found the pool. Couldn't find any friendly worker to help us.Would not stay here ever again and certainly would not recommend."
159,407,"Jun 6 2009 	what a pathetic place	This was our girl /Birthday's 2nd stay at the hotel, the 1st time we stayed there we got a update room to die for, it was huge! All we asked for was a update and we got it. This time a whole different story, the cleark told us that half the floors were closed due to the economy yet she still would't update us to a nicer room go figure you would think they would be doing whatever it took to keep their guest happy so we would return! She put us in a room so far away from the elevators it took 5 mins to get to your room!! We will never stay there again."
160,407,"Jun 4 2009 	Well we're booked to stay again in 2 weeks...	This hotel is very nice. Last year when we were there, they had a little bit of construction going on but it was really no bother. The ground floor was rockin the sound of those one arm bandit armies but the rooms were extra quiet. The steak house at NYNY is AMAZING! If you eat there, they will offer to take your picture (self, significant other, family, friends, whatever) - they probably charged us an arm &amp; a leg for the picture but it was and is the one purchase from that trip I wouldn't take back for anything. I don't know if it's still there but Nathan's Hot Dogs was there by the arcade - we went every night. The arcade is cool if you've reached your $ limit but still can't sleep. Good slots 2!"
161,407,"May 31 2009 	What a dump!	Halls were dirty, furnishings and carpet need to be replaced. No coffeemaker in the room. Tray from room service sat in the hall for over 24 hours before being picked up. The blanket on the bed needed to be replaced or at least cleaned-it gave me the creeps. Bathroom was fine but towels were thin. The casino was the most unappealing of all we went into and we visited many. Would never stay here again and do not recommend."
162,407,"May 31 2009 	It's a Casino...with a hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during a mid-week business trip in early May. I'm not going to get into reviewing the casino aspect of the hotel because I'm sure most people are familiar with Vegas and all that casino's have to offer.Upon entering the hotel for the first time I was somewhat confused where the check-in was as all I could see were slot machines. After wandering around for a few minutes, I found it. The check-in staff was quick and friendly and gave me a map of the casino/hotel and pointed me in the direction of the elevators. There are several towers in this hotel so it was a little confusing at first which set of elevators to take.The room was pretty standard, but at the mid-week rate of $79 it was a steal. No coffee maker in the room, but other than that I had no complaints. It was clean and the shower had excellent water pressure.The hotel offers wireless internet for $14.99 per day which I had to use for my business. The meeting room area was very nice and wi-fi did work in the rooms, which was nice. I've stayed in some hotels before where the hotel wi-fi does not work in the meeting rooms Depending on what tower you are staying in, the meeting rooms can be a hike to get to. During 15 minute breaks you have to move quickly if you want to get to your room and back. Although this is nothing new as my experience staying in the Rio was similar.Overall, the hotel was great, the casino offered a ton of different restaurants to choose from and staff was helpful."
163,407,May 29 2009 	Overall not a bad stay...	Normally when visiting Vegas I stay at The Signature at MGM but this time it was booked so I tried NYNY because we got a good deal on the hotel...Overall it wasn't a bad stay - I just don't know if I would stay there again unless I was there strictly to party (ex. bachlorette party)The Good:1) Check-in was very quick and the staff was friendly.2) The rooms were very clean and the cleaning staff was very nice.3) Great Location4) Hotel has a very upbeat feel to it.5) Rooms were a nice size6) Variety of restaurants/bars in the hotel7) Check out was fast The not-so-good:1) From our room you could hear the Roller Coaster going day and night.2) The long-long walk from the elevator to the room!3) No coffee maker in rooms4) I have never stayed at a hotel that doesn't at least have one movie channel (ex. HBO) - not that you go to Vegas to watch TV but sometime during &quot;down time&quot; it's nice. Their TV service is a bunch of channels advertising the ammenities of the hotel etc...5) A fridge in the room would have been nice...6) Pool is kinda small and getting a chair is nearly impossible7) No airport shuttle8) $15 a day for internet - NO THANK YOU!! (Thank goodness for Blackberry!)
164,407,"May 28 2009 	Great stay convenient location would stay again	Got a great rate on the hotel through my Players Club card. Check in was a breeze. Rooms: Upside: Great View. Stayed in a Park Ave Room. We overlooked MGM, Excalibur, Tropicana and the airport no extra charge. Room was very comfortable. The bed was nice and the room was clean. It was a handicap room, so there wasn't a bath tub but the shower was nice and newly renovated. Close to the elevator.Downsides: I had asked for a smoking room and got a non smoking one. My boyfriend, the smoker, said he didn't care because of the great view. In the bathroom the marble floors got a little slick when wet though and the grout lines were deep and hurt a little to stand on. The safe was locked when we checked into the room so we needed to call maintenance to open it up. That took at most 10 minutes and the man was very pleasant. You could hear the hallway noise but it was not overly loud or disturbing. Actually reminded me of hotels in &quot;real&quot; NY.Casino: NYNY had a nice fun atmosphere. The casino wasn't too big or too small. The dealers were friendly and the minimums were reasonable even on the weekends. Slots seemed to be paying off. We didn't win much but we saw quite a few hit when we were going around.Pool: The pool was on the small side and didn't get sun until around noon. During the week it was fairly empty. But all in all it was nice enough. 3 hot tubs were nice as well. Could have gone to Monte Carlo to use their pool as they are partnering up for the summer, but didn't make it over there.Food and Drink: We ate at America and Nine Fine Irishmen. America was average but the service was friendly. I would compare it to any casual dining restaurant. Nine Fine Irishment was a cute pub and the burgers were good. We also went to the dueling piano bar to watch the game and then stuck around for the entertainment. Drinks were regular Vegas prices. Pizza place was good for a late bite to eat as well. Next time we definitely want to try Gallaghers.Location: One of the best locations I've stayed at. The walkway connects with MGM where you can take the monorail to the North end of the strip. The other walkway connects to Excalibur and you can take the tram down to Mandalay Bay.Definitely would stay here again. Ride the Roller Coaster. Get a coupon online for a discount."
165,407,"May 27 2009 	Endless Fun!	Arriving at the NY NY is an experience in itself, the outside of the hotel is incredible with all of the realistic New York buildings, especially with the roller coaster (which was one of the main reasons I chose to stay there) winding itself through the faux skyscrapers! My stay was outstanding, I printed off some coupons off of www.destinationcoupons.com for the roller coaster, and got $4.00 off my ticket. That wasn't enough for me though, so I printed off another coupon for 4 passes and 2 photos for only $56.00. The service was great, there is non-stop action all around, and for so little money! Through that same website, I found a promotional offer and ended up staying for around $ 85.00 a night! Not to mention the impressive, gigantic casino! I would reccommend this hotel to anyone, I'd definitely even say that it's family friendly."
166,407,"May 26 2009	VEGAS BABY!!!!!	Vegas speaks for itself! We have gone during the week and also during the weekends. We stayed at the Stratosphere and New York New York. I HIGHLY recommend New York New York. Its a very nice hotel, very central to everything, and it has some really great restaurants and the pub &quot;Nine Fine Irishmen&quot; is outstanding!I would recommend visiting during the middle or early week. The weekend brings a ton of visitors, and it becomes more difficult to enjoy many of the attractions Vegas has to offer, not to mention gambling minimums go up. Look for deals on food and entertainment. They're out there, you just have to look. You may want to ask the hotel you are staying at if they have anything. One little tid-bit is for a really good deal, go to the pool at the Hard Rock Hotel. You don't have to be a guest to use it, just pay the $25 and you can stay there all day! Its a really nice place. Also a great place to gamble."
167,407,"May 25 2009 	Fun and convenient location. Good value for the money.	We got a good price on an airfare/hotel package for our second trip to Las Vegas. The check-in line was short on a Thursday night. Our first room was noisy due to being near an elevator. The next day we moved to a quieter room on a higher floor with no problems or additional charge. Both rooms were clean and comfortable. My wife enjoyed using the spa. We both enjoyed the roller coaster ride. Neither of us checked out the pool.Food and service were great at Il Fornaio. Service was slow at Pour 24 and the Players Club desk. There were two Starbucks plus a counter that sold Krispy Kreme donuts. There were many other counter service and sit-down restaurants that we didn't have a chance to try. All of the bars seemed busy Thursday through Saturday nights.The location is great with walkways across the street to MGM Grand and Excalibur.The NYNY was a fun hotel with clean, comfortable rooms, and we would consider staying there again."
168,407,"May 25 2009 	Restful and Relaxing	Hotel was great - we stayed in the New Yorker Tower, Skyline Rm, 26th Floor (in terms of proximity to roller coaster, we were at the beginning of the climb!). Front desk wrote our room number down wrong, but it only took moments to find out where we were supposed to be. My sister and I shared a room and for the most part it was clean, pretty spacious and modern. Would like them to replace bedspread as mine had seen better days, but then again, I don't use them knowing that they don't wash them that often! Bathroom was spacious and water pressure great. We were very close to the elevator, but never heard any 'outside the room' noise. Much better than the Excaliber hotel, which I stayed in on a previous trip. Location in terms of shopping, other hotels and airport, very good."
169,407,"May 23 2009 	Not staying here again...	Nor will I be staying at any other associated property. It took them 5 hours to clean up feces (you read that right) from just outside of my room. I had to call the front desk twice to deal with the issue, as the first time housekeeping couldn't find it, so they just sprayed air freshener. I had to find the source of the odor myself and tell them where it was. And joy of joys, it was on a trash can next to the pool elevator. While waiting for them to finally get rid of it, a homeless man came in, stole food from my neighbor's room service cart, and then proceeded to attack the ice machine. I had to call security 2 times, and had to wait 10 hours to be moved to another room. Bonus here, they still didn't catch the guy. After I told them I didn't want to stay another night, they offered me a $20 credit. I'm glad that my personal security and smelling someone's feces for 5 hours is only worth $20 to them.For the minor stuff, the shower head was broken, I called maintenance and they completely replaced it. There was white crap all over the floor, which housekeeping took care of well after I had checked in, and only because the maintenance guy called them. Do yourself a favor, and find something cheaper. Preferably someone who cleans up feces immediately."
170,407,"May 22 2009 	Overall Average coffee in the room would've been nice...read on...	We were not in our room long enough to really criticize it. But I do have 2 disappointing things to say about it. If you wake up early like myself and enjoy a morning coffee  you have 2 choices.you can either go to the star bucks downstairs and pay $4.00 a coffee for a small, or you can walk 2 blocks to McDonalds and get a coffee. Having no coffee maker in your room in my opinion is bad. Even budget hotels have mini coffee makers in the room. Is the hotel that hard up for money that they cant give their customers a small perk like that? My other beef was no fridge in the room. As hot as it is in Vegas, getting back to your room to have a cold bottle of water or beer is nice. We bought a case of beer for the room, and had to put it on ice every day. Good thing we brought a soft cooler. We used it at the pool every day. The pool, good luck getting a chair. If your lucky, and get one, good for you. We filled the cooler with booze every day (no glass aloud), and made our own drinks at the pool. On our 4th day there, we were told we were not suppose to do that as it took business away from the pool bar (8 beers in a bucket of ice was 30 bucks.come on, I can buy 2 cases of beer for that price). I said we had been doing this for 4 days and youre just telling us now that we cant bring our own booze down to the pool. Needless to say, we finished what was in our cooler, and left. They told me it was a min of one drink per person at a time for personal booze to be brought down to the pool. Like Im going to go up to my room on the 30th floor just to refill my cupNOT!We did eat at a couple of great restaurants while in Vegas. Wolf Gang Pucks in the MGM Grande.  5 ***** starsThe Buffett at Planet Hollywood on weekends has a great buffet, all you can eat seafood (including Alaskan king crab legs) get them steamed for you as they are cold. The Monte Carlos buffet was poor. ?The ESPN restaurant in NY NY is great. Try the smokehouse burger. I swear it is worth every penny for it. My husband ate 3 of them during the 4 days were stayed. Wear your running shoes a lot for just walking the strip. Your feet will thank you.If you are staying more than 2 days, get a bus pass. It will cost you 15 dollars for 3 days worth. This way you can go downtown to Fremont Street, or go to the outlet mall, or just take the bus  way down the strip and walk back to your hotel. (or 7 dollars for 24hour pass)We saw BELIEVE ~ Chris Angel ~It was great. This plays at the luxor hotel. He is hot in person. !!!Other than that, enjoy your trip to Vegas, The city that never sleeps ?Oh, I forgot to mention, our room was so far from the elevator, I would suggest asking for a room somewhat close.youll be sorry if your stuck at least a 5 minute walk from your room to it. Our friends couldnt believe how far away our room was. The hotel is deceiving"
171,407,May 21 2009 	Only Had One Night	We only had one night in Vegas and we stayed at the New York New York. We had a room near the the top of the Chrysler Tower. $200 for a Saturday night. It was very nice. We were very happy with the location on the strip and the hotel was very accommodating to us. It's just a fun place to be. We will definitely stay here again.
172,407,"May 21 2009 	Some things are perfect and some things got renovated	We went during a time that they were renovating the casino. I was a little sad about that since the reason I keep coming back to stay there is the NY city theme. The old casino used to have central park trees and times square lights. Now they have removed all this to give way to the new modern flair. While the gaming is still excellent and the restaurants and bars still have the same great feel, I can't help but miss that roulette in central park."
173,407,"May 21 2009 	Ok for first visit	Used Showtime Shuttle from airport - good service and value for money. Very quick check-in and was given complimentary upgrade to park avenue room. Stayed room 1880 (18th floor). Long way from lift but this suited me. Good size with king bed. Would have loved tea/coffee maker and fridge. Good view over looking the MGM. Airport/mountains could be seen behind this and you had fantastic sunrises every morning. Fair choice of eateries, a little pricey and felt a bit rushed in the American restaurant to pay bill - let me finish eating guys. Preferred buffet in Excaliber, purely because I can control the portions!!. Don't bother with MGM buffet(overpriced and more choice elsewhere). Fair location, plenty around to amuse. Use the Deuce bus for excellent value. Found casino very dark and smokey and was disappointed you couldn't use coins to play. Non smoking areas should be available but weren't. Couldn't get round the pool as were hogged by the invisible people brigade. This should be banned. Throw the towels in the pool!!! Went to see &quot;Zumanity&quot; no discount for guests. Show saucy and didn't personally think it was related to the &quot;Cirque&quot; family at all - wasn't that impressed and would prefer something else. Booked two trips with Casino tours. Both were well run and had a good day both to Hoover Dam/Lake Mead and to West Rim Canyon. Fell in love with the fountains at the Bellagio. If I came again I would have to stay there. Didn't appreciate being thrusted cards of semi-naked girls on every corner. If there is a mayor of Las Vegas - tidy up the sleeze and rubbish. Doesn't make for a pretty site. Overall New York is a fair starting point for a visit to Las Vegas. Remember: You get what you pay for."
174,407,"May 20 2009 	Decent Place to Stay 	Visited 5-14-09 thru 5-18-09; girl's weekend to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday. I have been to Las Vegas 3 times in the past 8 years and this was the first time I stayed at the NY NY. A family member had recommeded it.I booked three rooms back in February for this weekend. I had signed up on their website to receive email specials and booked at a very good rate. Our rooms ranged from $65 on Thursday to $149 for Saturday. Of course you always pay more on the weekends. We checked in around 7:30pm; had to wait about 25minutes. Not sure why they didn't have more staff on hand but it wasn't too bad. The staff were quick and friendly. We had a Park Avenue room, a step up from their standard Skyline room. The room was non-smoking with 2 queen beds which were very comfortable. Plenty of room for two people. The bathroom was also large, all marble with a shower and tub. The vanity is in the bathroom. My only complaint about the bathroom is that the tub did not have a safety bar, the tub was a bit high and slippery. I would recommend if you travel with an elder, you ask for a tub mat.I agree with other reviews, all the rooms should have a coffee pot. I did request a room away from the elevator and roller coaster. We were on the back side of the building, two small windows overlooked the parking garage. It was quite a walk to and from the elevator but pretty quiet. I never heard the roller coaster at all. It is only supposed to run from 11am to 11pm.The rooms were clean and maid service prompt. No complaints there.In other reviews, I noticed people stating how big this hotel/casino is. As far as Vegas hotels go, this one is average. I think the casino floor is smaller than many others.The atmosphere is very cute. The shops &amp; restaurants do resemble the streets of NY.Greenberg's Deli is a must if you like good ole fashion sandwiches. I prefer the hot corn beef on rye. For $8.00 you get a huge sandwich and they have a great potato salad.Plenty of food for two to split. The French bakery is to die for. Wonderful pasteries and sandwiches &amp; soups. And of course, there is a Starbucks on the &quot;street&quot; corner.We ate the American a few times. $3.50 for a coffe was a bit much, but the food was very good as well as the service. Breakfasts run around $10.00. From the outside it looks small, but the restaurant opens up and is very large. A must see is the US map on the ceiling.Another must is the dualing piano bar. There is a cover charge and drinks are bit pricey also but alot of fun. If you call ahead and reserve a table, the cover charge is $25.00pp, but for special occasions it is woth it. Of course, be prepared; they will only honor your song request if it is attached to a $20 or better..! Several of the bars do have happy hour specials. Be sure to check those out at the NY Ny.We actually visited the Mandalay Bay hotel and went to the Rum Jungle for a happy hour. Their jungle juice was very tasty..!!The Monte Carlo Brew House Pub has a good happy hour also. You can choose from a list of $5 beverages and appetizers. We ordered all five appetizers and fed 5 people. Very good food and portions. I had 4 sky vodka cosmos and for $20.00..!! This bar has several big screen tvs to kick back and watch the games. A good place to visit.The pool is not one of top rated in Vegas. Be prepared, it is on the back side of the hotel and at this time of year, the sun hit the pool area around 11:00am. But to get a chair, you must be down there at 9:00 when they open. The Monte Carlo is an affilate with NY NY, and your room key will work in their pool also. The Monte Carlo is across the street and does have 3 pools, not real big ones, but a bigger area. Again, get there right when the pool opens for a chair.The NY NY is a good place to stay. I would recommend it. The staff was pleasant, the rooms clean and had alot of fun ammendities. I would stay here again only if the price was right. I agree with other reviews, it is at the south end of the strip."
175,407,"May 20 2009 	What a Great Hotel	Stayed in the New York New York for six nights in the middle of May 2009.Managed to get an upgrade for the Hotel Room. 28th floor overlooking the Strip, which was a good size and kept very clean.The Art Deco look was excellent throughout.Casino are was one of the best out of all the ones seen mainly due to the very high ceilings allowing the Air Conditioning to work correctly not directly in your face.Pool was ok if not a little crowded causing a lack of sun loungers.All restaurants were good.Avoid ROK nightclub - Rip off on entry and very disappointing once inside.Bar at Times Square is a must with dueling Piano's great entertainment.Nine Fine Irishmen pub is good if not a little repetitive on the fiddly dee music. Careful on prices for drinks especialy Vodka and Red Bull.Coyote Ugly is ok but you will only need to visit the once.Manhatton Express Rollercoaster is a must.Overall would not hesitate to recommend and would re-book on a return to the mad world of Vegas....."
176,407,"May 19 2009 	Average stay in a huge hotel	The hotel is located right on the famed Las Vegas strip and it takes just around 7-8 mins from the airport. Each way taxi would cost around $ 10 excluding tips. The hotel is located at the southern part of the strip and is just across MGM Grand hotel. The hotel is a huge structure in itself and the facade is a replica of New York Skyline right with the Statue of Liberty in front! Being right on the strip, transportation is not an issue at all. The Deuce Shuttle stop is just in front of the hotel and the monorail stop is just a short distance walk on the backside of MGM Grand hotel. The area around the hotel is quite safe and is teeming with people even late into the night. Centre of the strip hotels like Bellagio and Ballys are around .75 miles. The rooms are very average in size (I would say smaller than all the other hotels I have stayed in the US) and are functional in nature with all the basic amenities. However I was quite surprised to find that inspite of booking a deluxe room, there was no refrigerator/ mini bar or coffee machine in the room. The lobby of the hotel comprises of a huge casino with some 2400 slot machines besides a huge array of table game. A section of the lobby is designed to look like a typical NY street and has a large number of restaurants and food joints including a Starbucks outlet. One of the key attractions of the hotel is the roller coaster which goes all around the hotel. The Cirque du Soleil production &quot;Zumanity&quot; is one of the more popular shows in the strip though I was quite surprised to find that the hotel did not offer any special discounts/ schemes to in-house guests. Next time I would probably go for a hotel which is towards the centre of the strip. Overall its a magnificent hotel with all the associated glamour but wanting as far as warmth of stay is concerned."
177,407,"May 19 2009 	NY NY I'll be back next year!!!	Hiya All,Stayed in NY NY Las Vegas April/May. My third trip to Vegas having stayed at Golden Nugget and TI before. I had a Park Avenue room and asked for a strip view for which I was happy to pay the extra $15 a day (but was never charged!). The room was fine.. clean and quiet and with a view of MGM and rollercoaster below. Room was a bit smaller than TI room I had last year. The best thing about NY NY is its a resort in its own right. There is so much to do and the atmosphere in the casino, bars and restaurants is great fun. I also found the gaming and slots to be better payouts than some of the others (won $500 on wheel of fortune slot). I just love Vegas and my stay at this hotel made me want to book again as soon as I got back. Any criticisms? not really the breakfast buffet was Ok on quality but lacking in choice (no bread or toast, just basic hot buffet and pastries) and the Breakfast at Il Fornaio was pricey ($24 for eggs, bacon coffee and juice) but not much else to gripe about. A great place to stay, it would be OK for singles, couples or families a special mention goes to Gallaghers Steak house  fantastic dry aged steaks, and also a mention for the Crazy Horse Paris show (Wow!...better than Zumanity) and KA both at MGM across the way, KA just blew me away Overall a great stay and a great hotel cant wait for next year!!"
178,407,May 19 2009 	SO BAD DON'T STAY HERE CAN'T GET A FREE DRINK	So bad. Gambled for 6 hours on our first night and couldn't even get a drink - no service even if we wanted to pay! Noisy due to renovation and just seemed so unclassy. Disgusting atmosphere. Also no in a good location - long walk down to centre of strip. Switched to Paris Hotel which was THE BEST. was also ripped of by hairdresser who charge $100US for the worst blowwave I have ever had.
179,407,"May 16 2009 	Didn't stay here-- thouroughly enjoyed the apmsosphere-- Breakfast buffet was delicious!	We walked over from the Flamingo looking for a different buffet to try. We stumbled across the breakfast buffet here at a Chinese themed restaurant (not sure of the name), it was $15 which seemed a bit pricey. I am not rating this buffet on it's size and variety, but how amazing everything tasted. The small amount of food options assisted me in not over-eating but, to really ENJOY eveything I put on my plate. Don't expect to get an omlette or have your eggs cooked how you like them.Do expect a variety of items you wouldn't ordinarally (no spell check--lol) eat for breakfast, such as fried rice with extra scrambled eggs-- a little odd, but delicious!! Our waiter was really cool too!"
180,407,"May 16 2009 	Ok Hotel	After researching for a few months I chose this hotel. NYNY is a neat place, I just wouldn't stay here again. It's not a bad hotel but I would rather stay a little further in the middle of the strip. We stayed Monday - Thursday and on Wednesday we hopped over to the Monte Carlo pool (which NYNY guest can be admitted to for free). The NYNY pool is small but it's fun. I would definitely suggest going to Monte Carlo pool, it's REALLY fun and it has a regular pool, wave pool and lazy river- it's a much younger crowd! We hit the piano bar-which is fun and we went to Coyote Ugly- it's ok but one night is enough. Also, the roller coaster is 2 for 1 from 11a-noon, if you tell ppl that you stayed here they always ask if you rode it- just go ahead and ride, it's only $14. Don't be discouraged if you have already booked here, it's a good place!"
181,407,May 14 2009 	Rooms need updating...!	Good location. Easy access from all directions; very close to airport and freeways.Rooms need updating. A little dated. VERY small TV; no refrigerator or coffee maker in room. Plenty of drawer/closet space. In-room safe convenient and easy to use. (free)Lots of free parking...easy to access. Long walk from garage to registration area.Pool hours are terrible! Only open until 6:00pm!?!?!?Get a room away from the roller coaster otherwise you will hear screaming every night until midnite! (Expensive to ride: $14)
182,407,"May 10 2009 	This place is awesome!	Stayed in the Broadway Suite...the room was spacious and had a great view of the strip!Didn't play any table games, but the slots were great!"
183,407,"May 8 2009 	Not as good as the Signature at MGM!	We stayed at the Signature at mgm in Aug 2007 cos we got married in Vegas but seemed to spend most of our time in The Newyork Newyork hotel because it had great slots, great atmosphere and good food so we decided to stay here this time and regretted it big time...luxury its not! and we went everywher except here this time??Basic it is and there was renovations going on that just seemed to ruin the atmosphere..the slots were rubbish too?Luckily I got lucky elsewhere and managed to win enough to pay for the hotel bill which was fantastic since I dont go on any machine over a $!Tried out the world famous rollercoaster which gave me a major migraine cos head got bashed about abit!!No coffee making facilities in room which was a real pain cos cant do anything till had that coffee!!Trying the Excalibur this year"
184,407,"May 8 2009 	Nice but showing some signs of age	Parking and check in were great. Usually I have a hard time getting multiple rooms taken care of, but not here. Front desk was very friendly, much better than what I usually get in Vegas. You will get nickel and dimed however - $3 for unlimited local calls? Don't people have mobile phones for this? But not too bad as far as additional charges go in Vegas. Also paid a whopping $30 for a roll away bed. Most of the rooms were upgraded a no charge because there were no more &quot;standard&quot; rooms. Views were terrible. Mine was of a strut on the roller coaster and the parking garage. Still had hair in the shower when I went into my room, also the art in the elevators were ripped off, and the wood veneer on my door was falling apart. Not too bad, good safe location."
185,407,"May 2 2009 	A good value and reliable	If you're looking to stay in 5-star luxury, this isn't it. But I say NYNY is the Las Vegas equivalent of a Honda Accord. Not too stylish, nothing too fancy, but a few perks, some nice features, and very reliable and worth the value.I have only stayed here once compared to many other times at similar value-style resorts in Vegas, but I was impressed with the overall cleanliness of the property. The rooms are in good shape, have everything in order, and nothing in my room was breaking. The furniture is decent, offers a few clever features for storing clothes and making your life easy when coming in late at night, and the TV was a decent one.The bathroom is well kept, decent size for this type of property, and has everything you need. The housekeeping service was prompt and attentive; the front desk was packed as usual and not too helpful. The good news is that once you figure out the lobby, it's an easy hotel to navigate, unlike some of the monsters in town.NYNY may not have the best location, but if you're looking for relatively nice places without wasting money, you're still right across the pedestrian walk from MGM Grand, and next door to MGM Grand. Excalibur is the other direction for good value, so there are places to go to get out.The vibe at NYNY is changing, so it may not be your type of place now, but if you just want a place to sleep but don't want to be grossed out or surprised, this is a reliable hotel."
186,407,"May 1 2009 	Good Location nothing special	We stayed in the New Yorker Tower, Park Avenue Room type on the 12 floor. Great view of sunset of the mountains; our room did not face the strip. Nice large window overlooking the pool at the back side of the hotel, but we didn't mind. After staying 4 nights, toileteries were only replenished one time. Don't expect personal items to be returned; we found some socks under the bed! There is only one set of elevators and our room was quite a walk from them. There are lots of places to eat near this hotel, such as Chin/Chin breakfast buffet, Fornaio, America, and Gonzalez gonzalez --we got sick eating here. This is just an average hotel, nothing to brag about."
187,407,"Apr 28 2009 	Totally blah - wouldn't stay here again	We stayed here at the recommendation of my friend - we were arriving Vegas mid-evening, planned to have dinner and hang on the strip, then one friend flew out early the next a.m. and two of us wanted to hang by a pool before our evening flights.We had a Park Avenue deluxe room - which was large, but definitely felt old and used. I was really disappointed in complete lack of amenities for a deluxe room - no water bottles in the room to purchase, no fridge, nothing. The rooms were also VERY loud with hallway noise, and even though we were supposed to be a non-smoking floor, the entire casino had a pervasive smoke smell.Check-in was horribly slow. The pool area seemed an afterthought - crowded, loud music blaring all day, and a rollercoaster flying overhead. I guess it does have the noise and bustle of New York!"
188,407,"Apr 27 2009 	Enjoyed our time in New York New York!!	Hotel, like everything in Las Vegas is enormous. We had a deluxe Broadway room which was an excellent size and easily accommodated 5 of us. Not many hotels in Vegas would take 5 of us without making us book 2 rooms. Had a view of the rollercoaster but the noise was not a problem at all. We were barely in bed before it closed each night. Pool is lovely. Plenty of places to eat within the hotel and in all the hotels nearby. Location is good. It feels like the best end of the strip. A bus runs continually up and down the strip and you can get a 24hr pass. Definately worth doing if you are going right to the other end as it is quite a walk. Hotel is not far from the airport so for 5 of us it was better value taking a taxi than a shuttle. Overall we were pleased with this choice of hotel."
189,407,"Apr 24 2009 	Bit Of A Let Down	We were very much looking forward to staying here as we had heard/read good things about it. When we turned up after an 8 hour drive from Reno we were a bit tired and probably our tolerance was running low but we had to wait about twenty minutes at reception despite seeing alot of staff behind the counter talking to each other, when we did get served the lady was very rude no smile or anything, anyway we got our keys and headed to our room which was difficult to find as there are many wings and different lifts.When we got to our room I was a bit repulsed to see a hairball(quite large) on the floor but too tired to worry about it, as our room was being serviced I thought we will just leave it there for the cleaners to vacuum up the next day-no still there when we got back from a day of activity. Finally I went downstairs to tell a man on reception who was quite nice but pretty blase about it. Now I know it's just a hairball and we could've just picked it up and put it in the bin but for the price you pay to stay here the cleaniness should be better. Anyway I feel this was an over-priced hotel and wouldn't stay here again."
190,407,"Apr 22 2009 	Ok if you like poorly lit rooms dirty furniture and a small pool	Booked this hotel for business as it was comparable with others (Monte Carlo, Excalibur) in the same price range. Would have preferred Bellagio/Caesar's but they were all over $300 a night. This location was just ok. Rooms and hallways were dark, the furniture in my room was stained and dirty, and the bathrooms were outdated - when was the last time you stayed in a hotel/resort with a sliding shower door? On one visit to the pool found it to be uninviting and crowded. Basically, a slab of concrete filled with water. There were no open chairs, and no easy access to the pool as all the chairs surrounded the edges. Talk to anyone in the know, this is one of the worst pools in Vegas. I would not recommend this location to anyone, there are much better options on the strip."
191,407,"Apr 21 2009 	Decent hotel nothing special.	Typical vegas, strip hotel. Nothing special, but it was nice. Great location, very few $5 tables (like most big hotels) so if you're cheap like me when you gamble you'll have to go somewhere else. Only ate at one restaurant, it was the breakfast buffet and it was pretty good and a reasonable price."
192,407,"Apr 20 2009 	Nice Vacation	Stayed at the NY NY for 7 nights and had a blast. Check-in was a little slow due to computer problems, but the desk clerk was very professional and accomodated our room request. I tippped him a $20 for his profficiency. For the second time in 15 years we came home with more gambling money than we went with. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone staying on the strip in Vegas. The hotel staff were very friendly and accomodating."
193,407,"Apr 18 2009 	Good Value Easy Location	Our family of 5 stayed here April 14-17 in 2 rooms 1 was a suite (for the me and the wife) and standard room (for the 3 boys). We booked a USAirways vaction at a great deal so basically we paid for the flight and these rooms were free.The location was very easy to get to from the airport and also easy to get around if you plan on driving around. The room had some water damage along the window and we had a lower floor room so no view. The Irish pub was great and they sat us in almost a private room on the 2nd floor. The dueling piano bar was fun also. We also ate at America was good.In the middle of our trip we took an overnight trip to the Grand Canyon, we stayed checked in to NY NY and just took overnight bags (We got our rooms for free so no sense in checking out)I would stay here again especially for the location and value."
194,407,"Apr 18 2009 	Good value option on the strip	We stayed one night in Vegas as part of a 10 day trip in the US, and picked this hotel for value, location, and for being New York! We were not disappointed.We booked a Park Avenue Deluxe room with strip view as a upgrade from a skyline room for $15 extra, which seemed excellent value. Room was spacious and spotless, on the 30th floor with a nice view over the MGM Grand and airport.We also dined in the Hotel/Casino at Il Fornaio which was lovely and good value. Suspend belief for a while and you could think you were genuinely in a NY Italian restaurant! The 'Il Fornaio Panetteria' is a great option for a breakfast pastry also."
195,407,"Apr 17 2009 	Nice. Great Value for the Money.	This is not the nicest place on the strip, but it is top 5. For the price, I highly recommend it. The rooms were clean, the people friendly. It is awfully crowded, though. Still, the Nine Fine Irishmen is the best place to grab a brew on the strip. I and my group had a couple of beers on the patio overlooking the strip (get there early and camp, or that space will be gone). Also, there is an In-N- Out Burger behind NY NY, which is great for curing hangovers."
196,407,"Apr 17 2009 	New York New York gets it right!	We stayed here for 4 nights in April, comped for 2 nights twice with a four-day gap in between. Both visits were great. Friendly service, fun slots and good places to eat. We were booked into a nonsmoking King Park Avenue Room without a problem. Room was clean and featured a flat-screen TV albeit on the small side, extremely comfortable bed and marble bathroom. The room also was quite spacious compared to some others we have stayed at on the Strip. Both times we were next to the roller coaster, which seemed to run all night long (!) Once you got used to the rumbling noise, however, it was reasonably tolerable. That was a minor downside to a nice stay. As for restaurant choices, we tried Broadway Burger for lunch; not too impressed; by the time we got our food - a 20-minute wait for a &quot;fast&quot; food joint - the fries and burger were cold. The Philly cheesesteak sandwich was delicious and still hot. We also tried Jodi Maroni's, a sausage in a bun place, which was good but not as spicy as we would have liked. We ate at America one morning for breakfast - check out that MAP!! It is really cool!The food was pretty good, not great. The best place was Sirrico's pizza. We ordered pizza to be made, at $16.50 for a large - and took it up to the room to eat. It was one of the best pizzas we have had - ever! We wanted to eat at ESPN Zone as we have gone there before and it was really good food, and we had our own private screen to watch the hockey game. Unfortunately, we couldn't get in while we were there at prime time. The casino was fun and drinks were brought very quickly, even though it was very busy. Check out both times was a bit slow but efficient nonetheless. We were charged $3.00 per day for a &quot;resort fee&quot;, which was really the use of the phone. You get charged even if you don't use it. We really enjoyed our stay at New York New York. It is also a walkway away from MGM Grand and a 2-minute walk to Monte Carlo, where you can save some dough and get McDonald's for breakfast! We saw Zumanity and it was okay (we were given 2 for 1 tickets with our room). We have seen Mystere and Ka and liked those much better."
197,407,"Apr 16 2009 	reasonable strip hotel.....	First time in Vegas and stayed here - good price and room was spacious. Hotel looks dated and tired in sections - everything needs a update. (some rooms had been updated)Room had view over coaster which even though could be heard was not an issue as the screams made us laugh. Room was not up to our expectations and not cleanest we had stayed in. This did not bother us as only slept very little in there. The restaurants in the hotel were terrible - mexican was basic and the Il Forniao was far too expensive for the quality of food and service (the food was tasteless). Better off in the MGM or Mandalay Bay if you want decent food. (PF changs and the Outback are also good food and you can get view across down the strip.) Belagio buffet is the best! The bars were OK, Nine fine Irishmen had a freindly atmosphere and the Time square was great fun. Casino was great and unlike some hotels the waitress service was always around when you wanted a drink. We would probably not go back to the NYNY, as we would like to stay somewhere else, but there is nothing major wrong with the hotel, for the right price!"
198,407,"Apr 15 2009 	great place to stay on a budget	Great themed hotel and generally good for people who want a nice place for a decent price. We booked a skyline room and were upgraded to a better room (Park Avenue I believe). Standard room, very spacious. The only bad thing was that it was a smoking room when we are non-smokers. There are many restaurants at the hotel, something for everyone. Tip: the Excalibur is next door and has an all day, all you can eat buffet with in and out privileges for $25. The nightclub at NY, NY is Rok, if you look around during the day/night you can find someone handing out passes to skip the line or for reduced cover. The show is Zumanity. Be sure to get tickets early. Coyote Ugly is also at NY, NY. No cover before 10:30. Initially it seems pretty weak and almost embaressing, but if you stick around the show is entertaining (dancing like in the movie). There is a large arcade at the top level with a fun rollercoaster. $14 for one ride. The pool isn't huge, but it's cute and good enough for the trip.The casino itself is a fair size. As long as you're gambling (doesn't matter how much) they serve you free beverages. NY, NY is on the south side of the strip so a far walk to the Wynn, Fashion Show Mall, Venetian, etc - but definitely doable. The hotel is also attached to the MGM Hotel through and an over the street walkway .There is apparently a mandatory $3/night phone charge which gives you local calls free using the phone in your room. This was advertised in our travel voucher and posted at registration but we were never charged for this."
199,407,"Apr 14 2009 	Good all around stay	We stayed ay NY NY in a Park Ave room. It was nice and clean, but pretty small. We had a view of the Excalibur and the roller coaster. Check in was a little slow, but overall the service was good. The pool area is small and nothing special. The food court area was nice, especially the pizza place. It was open late, so we usually grabbed a piece of pizza before heading to bed. The piano bar was fun and the whole casino had a good vibe. The casino is small enough to learn your way around which is good when it's 3 am and you can't think straight. The MGM across the street is huge on the other hand. Easy to get turned around in there, even when you are sober. Vallet service was good, and employees of the hotel were friendly and eager to help. It is located pretty far south on the strip, but there are several casinos and shopping areas close by. Overall we had a good stay and would recommend NY NY."
200,407,"Apr 13 2009 	Average Hotel	My husband I and just returned from a long weekend in Vegas, we booked at New York because of the price through Southwest Vacations..We did upgrade to a Marquis suite and this room was large and clean, however it was old appearing..We have been to Vegas several times and usually the rooms are new looking or refurbished..this room like I said was clean, but the bedspread , the carpet, the bathroom let alot to be desired...We did enjoy the large jetted tub, felt good on the legs after walking all day...The rest of the hotel and casino were fine, not too smoking and we ate the pizza place, (good but way greasy) and we ate at the American restaurant because the were open 24 hours..the meals here were very good, ..The casino was small enough I learned my way around the first night.. All in all we had a great stay..Would I go back to New York--probably not..I like a more modern room...But the people who worked here were super nice...and this is a big plus.. Oh we also went to Anthony Cools at Paris, I don't think I have ever laughed so hard..I recommed this show.. The Serendipity restaurant was also very good with huge portions and too die for mojito's ...and I love the twisted sister drink at Diablo's yum yum.."
201,407,"Apr 12 2009 	Perfect stay - free upgrade	My wife &amp; I went to Vegas because Southwest had 50% off flight specials and she had never been. I did a lot of research of trying to find the best place to stay for us. I have been to Vegas 3x before and have stayed at NY, NY once. I kept that in mind when I was looking, but open to other options. The bottom line though was through the NY, NY website they had a free room upgrade offer which would allow us to overlook the strip. I couldn't pass on this, for the price and the location of the hotel along the strip. The MGM Grand is across the street, as is a place to buy cheaper day off show tickets, which we took advantage off our final night there. We saw Beatles LOVE, Elton John &amp; Blue Man Group in 3 days in Vegas. All tremendous shows. We did alot of walking, but the 3rd day there took advantage of the bus. The roller coaster at NY, NY was not running most of the time we were there due to the high winds. But, overall, we had a great stay at NY, NY and will stay there again."
202,407,"Apr 11 2009 	good location enjoyable stay	We stayed at this hotel from 3/4-8/4/09. Check in didnt take too long - booked a broadway ave deluxe room - room was spacious (think this block had recently been refurbished) and clean, as was the bathroom, with a good, powerful shower. The view was the brick wall of the next tower - i called to reception about an upgrade to a room with a view but this would have been at least $15 per night so we decided not to as would be out on the strip for most of the stay - it just meant that the room was quite dark with no natural sunlight, so it was always nice to get outside! We stayed on the 6th floor, and only comment would be that you constantly hear the lift going up and down, even though we were not that close.Ordered room service one night, reasonable prices and you get lots for your money! The rollercoaster is worth doing, we also did the rides at the stratosphere which were brilliant, and you see some great views from the tower there.The hotel was in a good location, opposite the MGM and the facilities within the hotel were very good with lots to see and do. We went to see Zumanity, the Cirque de Soleil show based at our hotel (guests of NYNY get 2 for 1), and that was excellent. We also made use of the Deuce bus to get up and down the strip, but most of the big hotels are within walking distance (tip - take comfy shoes and a refreshing foot spray - i could have done with this after a long day walking up and down!).Would definately go back, although might also try another hotel just for some different scenery - the MGM, Mirage and the Venetian were my favourite."
203,407,"Apr 10 2009 	Don't use their website to book room	Booked hotel after recommendation only to find out I could have booked same room thru discount site for $40 a night cheaper, it even linked me to new york's own reservations page. Rang the hotel to find out if the room I had booked (with a view) could be guaranteed (e-mail confirmation of booking pointed out that my room with a view might not be available, even though I had booked it four months in advance) as it was a birthday gift for my wife, only to be told that my room might not be available on the day I check in. I cancelled my room there and then, why pay the extra $40 for a room you might not even get . I e-mailed the hotel in the hope that I might get an answer as to why if I was willing to pay the extra $200 for my weeks stay could they not guarantee my room with a view. Guess what still waiting, so folks spend your money elsewhere because if they are that stupid as to give up $200 (lady on phone told me to book discounted room) God knows what the hotel service is like. My big tip is book thru discount websites as they all link you to hotels own reservation pages and there are some greats deals to be had."
204,407,"Apr 9 2009 	Worth every penny we lost on the slots!	I booked this hotel because of what we saw on our past trips to Vegas. It just had a real nice ambiance and decor. The Bar at Times Square was a blast but of course there is a cost to that. It is Vegas after all. We ate breakfast at Il Fornaio on our last day and while it fine we preferred the breakfast at America more. We ate at ASPN Zone and watched the Canucks game which was a good time. The chicken ceasar wrap was great.We spent a lot of time on the slots and even won some on Deal or no Deal. The gentleman at the sports betting was quite helpful. Never tried the tables here.On arrival we had no line up. They put us in a room with two double beds. We had asked for a king. We called down and were told that they were full and to try again the next day. We had a strip view and could see the roller coaster. Yes we could hear it but it stops around midnite so who cares. When I go to Vegas I don't plan on getting to bed early. The next day we called around 5 pm and they happily moved us to a new room with an even better view. The move was as easy as packing our things and walking to the new room. No issues at all for it to happen. Was a little disappointed with the pool. It is not that big and can be hard to find chairs to lay down on. Not a big issue for us as we always have lots to do. Besides if I wanted a great pool area I would go to Mandalay Bay or Tropicana.The only truly negative thing I can say it the $3 per night phone charge. Frankly I do not need a phone so paying an extra fee for it is rather frustrating. I know others do it as well (Excalibur) but they were less. Some still include the phone. I guess it the way of the future but I still don't like it.All in all I enjoyed the NYNY. It was very nice and elegant. When you enter the casino area you go down an elevater which allows you to see the majority of the casino floor. It helps to look around quickly so you can see where things are and how to get to them.Make sure you hit Margaritaville in the Flamingo, Freemont St, and Coke World for different floavors from around the world. Beware of the flavor from......"
205,407,"Apr 9 2009 	Stay was nearly flawless	Stayed three nights on a busy weekend (Spring Break / CMA Awards / Final Four) in a Broadway Deluxe room. Second trip to Vegas (last time was Monte Carlo). The room was large and had two enormous banks of windows. Great views to the east/south - MGM Grand and Excalibur. Also, the coaster was right outside the window - some noise but never a problem. We loved the view day and night. The room was significantly larger than a friends Parkway Deluxe (which had 1 small window).We ate at America (L and B), Gallagher's (D), and Il Fornaio (B) inside the hotel. All were very good with great service. Avoid Coyote Ugly unless you like cattle conditions - crowded, no chairs, very loud music. The dueling piano bar is great - always packed. We did not try Rok Vegas, ESPN Zone, or the Irish Bar. The pool complex is good. Hot tubs are very good, but sporadic drink service. The gift shop/convenience store was great - reasonable prices on champaigne, etc. to take up to your room. The only small issue we had was checkin - lines were long (10 minute wait) and our room was not ready until about 3:30pm. The casino is good - above many. Hard to find $5 tables anytime on weekends - but I was told that completely depends on the crowds - you might on slow weekends.The spa is small but nice.The overall resort is very large, but they pack so much into every space that it gets very crowded - like all of the resoirts strip. After a while I was pretty tired of dodging people everywhere you try to walk. But, that is the nature of the Vegas beast unless you find a slow weekend or mid-week trip."
206,407,Apr 5 2009 	Clean Tidy and well located	Stayed here for 3 nights in July '08. Would recommend. It was clean tidy and very safe. The room was of a very high quality. Perhaps not the most expensive hotel on the strip but we weren't looking for that and we got more in the room then we were expecting. The staff were extremely helpful especially the front desk who provided us with anything we need.
207,407,"Apr 4 2009 	NY NY Las Vegas is a good fit for us	My wife, son (age 17), and I stayed 3/31 to 4/03. This was our second stay at NY NY in 6 months. Don't be afraid to ask the desk for your needs. There is an attendant posted at the far right side of the registration desk who helped us with hotel information and even printed out map blast directions to a local business for us. My wife and I used our MGM players cards at the tables and slot machines. We have had good gaming luck at NY NY. The black jack tables have $10 minimums. We ate at the Asian buffet, the patio restaurant, and the fish and chips stand. All are good. Many reviews have mentioned the comfortable beds. Ours were fine as they were last visit. The nightlife is fun. Grab a drink and have a walk from bar front to bar front and enjoy the variety. There are a few nearby hotels which offer slightly better rates. We have stayed at these and found they are not worth it. We plan on returning this Summer on a midweek special."
208,407,"Apr 3 2009 	Great but no wow	Just returned from our usa trip. New York New York Hotel Las Vegas, Great hotel.Check in was very quick, no lines. We had a Park Ave, deluxe room. The room was spacious and clean, as was the bathroom. Our view was of the Monte Carlo Hotel and the swimming pool. We could also see the roller coaster, but could not hear it, which was good. Only 2 negatives, of this hotel was that the walls are PAPER THIN we could hear everything. And I mean everything that the couple next door were up to....................................Our 2nd negative was that there was not enough people serving in the food areas which caused long lines, but apart from that everything else was good,"
209,407,"Apr 3 2009 	Average	Valet service was quick and professional, the check in was painless and went quickly. The hotel room was nice, nothing that blew me away. What little time we spent in the room, the only complaint would be the reception on the TV was terrible. Spent some time in the Casino and at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel/casino, everything was pretty nice. Little pricey for food and drinks especially for Vegas. Over all no real complaints and I would stay here again."
210,407,Apr 2 2009 	Great Room good fun had fun!	We were able to check in at about noon and we upgraded to a marquis suite which was well worth the extra $55 per night. Couple of huge positives about this room: 1. It had a hot tub that could fit three people in it if you wanted which was almost a must after long days of walking all over the strip. 2. It was on the 32nd floor with a great view and the top floors had their own elevator which skipped the first 20 to 25 floors which was awesome! The room was very clean and they did a nice job fixing the room everyday while we were out. There was a great Bose sound system with a DVD played that I wish we would would have known about because it would have been cool to watch a movie on that system. We also had a fridge that we stocked with pop and water from the CVS down the street. Wireless internet was available for 14.99 per day which was a bit steep.
211,407,"Apr 1 2009	Great stay for the money	I've played at NY NY many times but never stayed there so when I got a discounted room I figured I'd give it a shot. While overall I don't like the facility as much as MGM, it was certainly a good hotel.Check in was very quick and we were given our room upon check in at 11am. We asked for a room at the end of a corridor to keep noise to a minimum and this was accomodated. The room itself was decent, not over the top luxurious by any means, but quite comfortable and certainly very clean. It was also the quietest Vegas room I've ever stayed in. I heard no outside noise (helicopters, sirens etc.) and very little inside noise---nothing more than you get at any hotel.I did find the bartenders, dealers, waiters etc. etc. to be VERY accomodating. NY NY like most places lately has had layoffs so the folks who are left are those who have seniority and are good at their jobs. I found the service everywhere excellent.while here we ate at America twice. One dinner and one lunch. Both meals were excellent. We also tried 9 fine irishman for lunch and that was good also but not as stand out as America. If you're going here for the pool scene, don't. It's that simple. One of the smaller hotel pools on the Strip. Certainly acceptable for a quick dip or to lay in the sun but don't expect much if any action here."
212,407,"Mar 29 2009 	Park Ave Deluxe room not so deluxe.	Stayed at NY,NY March 25th-28th and had booked an air and hotel package through Airtran Vacations. The package included the Park Ave Deluxe room, but it did not meet our expectations from the website description. It said it was 400 sq ft, but the bathroom door almost hit the toilet and you could barely walk between the bed and the combination entertainment center/wardrobe (there was no closet). We were on the 15th floor and had a view of the parking garage, a roof and the pool of you pressed your face against the window all the way to the left. Good view of the people in the roller coaster as they went whizzing by though. It was very clean and the furniture was nice, but I shudder to think what size the standard Skyline room was. Also, they did not ask if I would be interested in an upgrade, or ask our preferences, except for smoking or not, when we checked in.Also, the booking included 20% discounts at a couple of the bars and the NIne Five Irishmen Restaurant and $20 Free Play, but they couldn't find this info with my reservation. Luckily I had my itinerary and managed to get the Free Play, and they said when I charged the food and beverages to my room the discount would reflect on my final bill...nope. Had a hassle over that too. They were very nice and helpful in working it out, but I didn't expect all this time wasted on my trip.Also, I know it's Vegas, but food and drink is expensive. There aren't any deals for restaurants in NY,NY. Your best bet is to go next door to Excalibur and have the buffet. (You can buy an all day pass for $25.) Drinks cost $6 for a bottle of beer and $7 for a Bloody Mary. Went to Coyote Ugly and it was Happy Hour, 2 beers and 2 shots of Jack came to $20!!! It's legal to drink on the sidewalk, so we went down about 3 blocks to the mini mart and bought 24 oz cans for $3 each and walked the strip. (If we had a mini fridge in our room we would have stocked up.) When we were hanging out at NY, NY we played the penny machines and took every advantage of the free cocktails. We're not poor or cheap and understand the cost of living in other cities, but the prices in casinos are outrageous. We got married there 5 years ago and they were nothing like this."
213,407,"Mar 29 2009 	A superb stay	This was our first visit to Las Vegas, so we wanted a hotel on &quot;The Strip&quot; that be comfortable but without breaking the Bank. After a long flight from LGW we got a taxi straight from the airport to the hotel. On arrival someone took our baggage and said that they would send them up to or room once we had checked in. The Check in desk was busy but it did not take long for us to get checked in, Check in staff were very friendly and helpful.Our room was a &quot;Broadway Room&quot; on the 25th Floor with a superb view of the southern end of The Strip. The room was large with two comfortable double beds and plenty of space. The bathroom, although not large was well equiped with soap, shampoo etc. The room was very clean and tidy. Internet access was availalble either by Wi-Fi or cable but there is a charge.The hotel has everything you could want, the Casino, shops and plenty of places to eat and drink. We used the Casino most evenings and although it was busy we never had any problems in finding something that suited us. We ate in the Irish Bar and also in the ESPN Zone bar on several occasions and the food was very good.The hotel is a short walk to the bus stop on The Strip and the &quot;Deuce&quot; service will take you anywhere along The Strip for $3 or $7 buys you an all day ticket.In summary, we had a relaxing stay in this superb hotel complex."
214,407,"Mar 27 2009 	Excellent Hotel with Good Vibe in the Casino	Stayed here for 5 nights in March 2009. We were upgraded tot he Park Avenue Room which was roomy and the bed comfortable. We were in the Century Tower on the 21st Floor but lifts were very quick and efficient. We ate in Gallaghers Steakhouse in the Hotel which is one of several. Quite simply the best Fillet Steak I have ever tasted. Used the pool and it was excellent especially when the weather was warm, 3 spa pools, waitress service, DJ playing music. The Casino although not the biggest on the Strip has a great atmosphere and is always buzzing from Coyote Ugly, ESPN Zone, Village Street, Rok Las Vegas and the New Center Bar. Stay here you will not be dissapointed"
215,407,"Mar 27 2009 	Reasonably priced great location for seeing the sights	I stayed here for New Year's Eve with a group of friends. We booked the room online and took advantage of an extra night promotion advertised on their website. The rates were reasonable for a week's stay, considering it was New Year's Eve. The actual nightly rate for New Year's Eve was very steep (as pwere all the hotels in Las Vegas) but the free night promotion and the other night's rates averaged it out.There were four of us sharing our room. We opted for a Broadway Suite which was the 4th largest out of 7 rooms. The room was ok but pretty small for 4 people. We requested a rollaway bed for one of our party, twice before arriving. We then asked upon check in and they still did not bring it up until we called Reception yet again to remind them.The room was clean and basic, we did not spend a lot of time there so this was all we needed. Breakfast was not included but you can eat fantastic all-you-can eat buffets at most of the hotels in Vegas (we had a great champagne brunch buffet at the Flamingo and the best buffet in town, without a doubt was at the Rio....we'd never before seen so many varieties of food available!) There are plenty of restaurants, cages and fast food chains within the hotel itself. It's easy to pop downstairs for a quick bite to eat, an ice cream or even for a drink in one of the many bars.The hotel has loads to see and do. In Vegas each hotel is like a resort in itself. New York New York is really well themed and there are so many little details which really add to the feel of being in New York at the same time. The interior of the hotel is really well designed and replicates streets and monuments in New York. Each building which is part of the hotel is a replica of a famous building...the Chrysler Building, Statue of Liberty, Empire State, and so on. Having visited most of the main hotels in Vegas, I thought that theming-wise, New York New York was one of the most effective along with Paris and The Venetian.New York New York is a great base for sightseeing and has everything you could need to explore the Strip. It's within walking distance of the Mandalay Bay, Luxor and Excalibur at one end of the Strip (and even the famous Vegas Sign nearby) and then in the other direction is in walking distance of many more hotels including Paris, the Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, Caesars Palace, and more. The MGM Grand, directly opposite to New York New York, is linked by a walkway andcontains a monorail stop within the hotel. So it is very easy to get around from the hotel.I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel that is quite centrally located on the Strip. Great place to explore Vegas."
216,407,"Mar 26 2009 	Great Hotel!	I had called ahead of time to let them know an extra person was staying in the room, but once we arrived they had not prepared the room for that person. Once I called housekeeping, they were very friendly and quick to give us towels etc. There are some good restaurants at the bottom of the hotel, with a few open 24 hours, which is great when you are coming back late from a night out and you have the munchies! The bars are fun expecially when there were live bands playing. Convenient coffee shops, souvenir stores etc. The location is a little a way from the centre of the strip, but is still surrounded by other fun hotels with lots to do. Jumping in a taxi was the best way to get around as the buses were extremely slow. Overall, a great and very comfy stay!"
217,407,"Mar 25 2009 	Our room had been renovated	Stayed last night at New York, New York. Wanted to stay at Venetian or Mandolay Bay but read on Trip Advisor about the smell. We walked over to those two hotels and the reviewers were correct, it made me sick from the pumped in smell. It is to hide the cigarette smoke I think. How can people stay there? We were on the 26th floor of New York, New York and our room had new carpet, bedspreads and very nice sheets. The bathroom was nice. The room was very dark. Forget about reading in your room. It is like a cave due to only a couple of lights with energy saving bulbs. They do not want you in your room anyway, you are supposed to be gambling. The pool was open and it was fine. Plenty of room for everyone. I checked out on the TV in my room--two seconds. Why are people standing in line checking out?? There was one person in line in front of me during check-in. I will stay there again. PLEASE give us Wi-Fi in our rooms for Free. In the year 2009--to have to pay for that connection is absurd."
218,407,"Mar 25 2009 	I Loved the Hotel	The hotel was amazing. Our first room didn't have any sort of view (parking lot) and they moved us to a great room the next day. Would have moved us right away but we wanted to stay on same floor as our friends. Staff were wonderful - especially front desk. When I asked about hours for a pharmacy , front desk person called them to determine their hours. 100% for me."
219,407,"Mar 24 2009 	Would recommend this hotel	Stayed at NYNY for 9 nights (second trip to Vegas) mid March 2009 and found the hotel to be great. Check in was a breeze and we had booked a Broadway Deluxe room with a strip view. The room was quite large and the bed very comfortable. Bathroom was nice but for some reason no exhast fan so mirrors were always fogged up. Maid service was sufficient and room always smelt fresh. As some other reviewers mentioned the walls are thin but over the 9 nights we only had rowdy neighbours for 1 night - hardly a major inconveniance. The hotel has lots of choices to eat and some great shops. Casino itself was large enough not to get lost in and always found a slot machine or position at roulette table. Dealers were friendly and made the gambling experience fun even if you lost. Drink service while gambling was sometimes slow but if you tip well they would keep them coming. Overall I would recommend NYNY - it is at the end of the strip but is close to many other hotels (MGM, Excalibur, Luxor, Monte Carlo and Tropicana) regardless of where you stay you will have to walk or navigate down the strip at some stage. The major tip I would give people if you plan to gamble at NYNY and their partner hotels (Bellagio, MGM, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Luxor and many others) is to sign up for a players card straight away - we were only told about it by a roulette dealer on our third last day and during those three days of table and slot play were able to receive 2 nights out of our nine for free, a $50 voucher at America restaurant and $20 of free slot play. If we had of signed up on our first day I am positive most of our accommodation cost would have been comped. Check out was a breeze and Bell Service quick and friendly."
220,407,"Mar 22 2009 	Just OK.	The outside of the hotel is gorgeous, with the NYC skyline, and it continues its looks on the inside. We travelled during March Break, which might have been part of the problems we had. Our room (which they upgraded since they ran out of the one we booked), was right next to a bunch of college guys and they were annoying! Granted, I can't blame the hotel for my nrighbours, however the walls were so thin. Not only could we hear their conversations, but we could hear their phone ringing. Also, we were annoyed to realise the mornig we were checking out, that hotel guests got 10% off meals at a couple of the restaurants inside the hotel. We ate at those restaurants 3 times, at it was neevr mentioned! Overall, its a nice hotel, but I didn't like the service we received, or the really thin walls. However, I will give credit where credit is due, and the interior at the back of the hotel is amazing! Its like they rebuilt NYC inside the hotel with all the little shops and stores. That blew me away!"
221,407,"Mar 18 2009 	Staying further down the strip next time	This was the first time in Vegas for me and I was completely amazed! The NY,NY is almost to the end of the strip, it's a lot of walking but right across the street is the MGM and they havea monorail stop (ride it, trust me). The hotel itself was huge as is most of the other hotels but as a small town girl, I was a little overwhelmed. The room was nice sized but I do believe it was decorated either in the dark or by a blind person. Not to sound picky or anything but it was loud! But then again, it's Vegas and who spends that much time in the room? We had an awesome view of the mountains. You have to pay extra for a strip view but really, like I said, who spends that much time in the room? The check in was brief, didn't take long at all. People in the casino are nice it is so busy though, if you order a drink, be prepared to wait a LONG time to get it! We went to the America restaurant one night, not the best but was a decent meal, and we went at 11pm so... The layout of the hotel is pretty easy to negoitiate after a little bit of time! it is on the corner w/ Excalibur on one side and MGM on the other. Overall, we had a good time. Would I stay here again? Yes but want to experience further down the strip first. TIP: when you are in Vegas go see Blue Man Group at the Venetian...well worth it!"
222,407,"Mar 18 2009 	Great hotel Comfy beds Great Service!	We just got back from our Trip to Vegas March 9-13th. My boyfriend and I had never been to Vegas so we weren't really sure where to stay. We booked our vacation with WestJet vacations and they did a great job of giving us lots of different hotel options for a great price. We chose the New York New York because it looked hip, fun, and was decently priced. We arrived in Vegas at 10:00pm and had about a 10 minute wait at check-in. The check-in lady was VERY nice and got us checked in promptly. She even upgraded us to a Park Avenue Deluxe room for free. (We had booked a Skyline room) We got just what we had asked for-a non-smoking room with a King size bed. We stayed in the NyNy Tower room 1110 and the view was amazing. If you are older or have kids I wouldn't suggest asking how far of a walk the room is from the elevator, because my boyfriend and I are both physically able to walk perfectly fine and found it to be a very long walk to the elevator from our room.Our room was great. VERY clean, shower worked well (good pressure) and the bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. I haven't slept that well in a while. The mandatory $3 a night fee for the telephone came in handy because we made many phone calls to get show tickets/times/reservations. When we couldn't find any extra pillows we called down to housekeeping and they brought us up some extra ones along with extra towels within 5 minutes of me making the call. GREAT service!There were only two things we didn't like about the room. 1. The shower doesn't drain very well. It wasn't until we got back to Ottawa that we realized that they actually do this on purpose to try to get you to conserve the water. (You end up soaking your feet while you're showering basically)2. Our room was overlooking the rollercoaster so you would hear a lot of rattling from the metal and some yelling from the riders. It wasn't unbareable by any means, but it may be a nuisance for some people. The hotel itself has lots of great food options and they really try to keep with the NY theme. Casinos are all really smokey and the hotel always seemed really busy.The night before we checked out we called down to the desk to see if a late check-out would be a possibility. They allowed us to check-out at twelve noon even though check-out was supposed to be at 11am. Our flight only left at 11:30pm that night so we had a long day and wanted to check out as late as possible. Upon check out, we had some luggage we needed to put aside so we brought it to the Bell Desk and they dealt with it very quickly and stored it away safely. It was fast and friendly.Upon check-out we only waited about 3 minutes and the lady at the check-out counter simply asked for our names and then told us we could keep the key as a souvenir, and thanked us for staying there. That was it. Simple and fast.My boyfriend and I are not fussy travelers and we are satisfied if our bed is comfortable enough to fall asleep in, the room is clean and that we feel safe throughout our stay. We were very pleased with our stay at the New York New York"
223,407,"Mar 17 2009 	Great location and value. Rooms are questionable.	We stayed in the spa suite. The bed was very uncomfortable and we could hear everything going on around us. The huge tub with surrounding mirrors was great, but that was the ONLY highlight."
224,407,"Mar 17 2009 	Dissapointed	We went to the NYNY in October last year (2008), and were very dissapointed. When we walked into the casino, the centre of it was cordoned off as they were doing some construction work, and we could hear loud hammering noises. We went to Vegas to experience all the casinos, and on a previous visit had really liked NYNY but we feel that we should have been told about this when booking (we rang to book).We were two couples, and had rang to book to request rooms close to each other. On arrival and after a very long check in, we were told that the rooms were in the same tower but on different floors, this was OK although not what we requested. Our room was dated although had everything we needed. Compared to rooms at the Luxor and Treasure Island, where we had previously stayed for similar prices, the rooms were nowhere near as good. Unfortunately, our friends room had a strong smell of smoke, when they rang down to say that they had a smoking room and wanted a non smoking room, they were told that they didn't have to smoke. Their room was changed the following day to a non smoking room.The bars and restaurants were OK, but felt a bit rubbish as we could hear the construction work, and this also blocked our view of the whole casino. The pool area was small and not as good as others on the strip.Location wise, its OK, although in future I would stay nearer to the Bellagio."
225,407,"Mar 13 2009 	Outdated Rooms	We went to Vegas last June and stayed at MGM. This trip we decided we wanted to stay somewhere different, and went with New York New York because it was the best rate we received. I didn't expect New York New York to be as nice as MGM, yet we were still disappointed in general. Check-in was long and drawn out, it seemed as if the person helping us had no clue what she was doing. We were upgraded to a Park Avenue with a &quot;deluxe strip view,&quot; and I am so grateful we were, because based on our &quot;upgrade,&quot; I NEVER would have wanted to see a Skyline Room. The Park Avenue was set up in a very strange manner. The armoire seemed way too big for the room and was oddly placed. Also, there was no closet. The bathroom was tiny. The beds were incredibly uncomfortable, and the linens were something you might expect to find in a rundown motel. I don't understand what was done when the rooms were renovated because it seemed very outdated. My biggest complaint was the fact that housekeeping did not show up until around 3pm each day. Everyone in my party is an early-riser, so our room was always vacated early, yet we would come back around 3pm to find housekeeping just coming in to fix the room. I am just glad that it wasn't warm enough to sit by the pool because the pool area looked very disappointing, especially when compared to others on the strip. There were some positives about the hotel - the 24 hour essentials shop was a great place to get everything you need. The hotel overall was incredibly clean and well-maintained, and the restaurant Chin Chin was very good. Basically, if you have kids I would recommend the hotel for the family friendly vibe, but if you are looking for a decent hotel at a good price, I would definitely suggest going to MGM instead."
226,407,"Mar 11 2009 	NOT a 4 Star Hotel	Cleanliness: AverageService: I give this an average review due to one issue. I received free Zumanity tickets with my room, but I was then charged for them. I had to wait in line to have the charge removed, even though they were supposed to be comped automatically. I had the feeling that the &quot;automatically&quot; never happened and that the whole thing was kind of a scam. Otherwise, everyone was helpful and friendly. Also, the $3 per day phone charge was a joke.Location: Not bad...it's kind of at the end of the strip.Value: Average.Rooms: This was my biggest complaint. The decor was very dated. There was no fan in the bathroom, and there was no vanity outside the room. My iron and the makeup mirror lights did not work. The bedspreads were visibly worn and threadbare. The pillows and bedding in general were of a very low quality. Also, while being near the elevator was nice, I could hear it all night long.The restaurants and casino overall are pretty good. It is a fun place to hang out, but I would not stay there again."
227,407,"Mar 10 2009 	Big Changes at New York New York	We always seemed to end up at the New York New York when going to Vegas in the evenings because of the atmosphere, Live bands in the Big Apple pumping out Rock and Roll, The look of walking down thru Central park and a fun place to party. We started staying at the hotel when going to Vegas. Big shock in Novenber of 2008 for my wifes birthday, The Big Apple was gone, The Central Park was gone and replaced by machines and what was booming out all over the casino in the evening- full blown rap music from a new club that had just opened. We will be staying some place else from now on."
228,407,Mar 8 2009	Follow up to	A very nice rep from New York New York read my review and took the time to find me. I received a email so I called. She was very sorry this happened and said she would make sure that the clerk and Manager would be address and this would be brought up in meeting to work on Customer Service. She offered a comp room for my next trip and asked that it be offer to a guess at random. I just wanted to be heard.Thank you.
229,407,"Mar 5 2009 	Would not choose this hotel again because of service	The rooms were okay. Housekeeping does an excellent job. However the desk does not understand the word service. I took my Dad down -his first trip. We had booked a room with two beds, smoking. When we arrived at midnight I was told that there were no rooms available with two beds but they had upgraded me to a room with a king bed, non smoking and a strip view. When I stated that one bed would not work they said they would give me a cot. I do not consider a cot an upgrade! Besides which I had to phone an hour later to ask where the cot was. No one apologized. Being in the business I know what happened! I was told they would move us between 9 am and 11 am the next day. When I called the next morning at 10 am the desk told me that they didn't do room moves until between 1pm and 3 pm! Slight lack of communication or the desk person at night didn't want to deal with me anymore. I was put through to a manager and guess what -there was a room available immediately. Why do guests have to get really upset and go to managers before anything happens. Just a quick note- the strip view is not worth it-window very small and you had to climb around furniture to see anything. Our standard room had floor to ceiling windows with a decent view. We had a buffet breakfast in the small restaurant the first morning and I would definitely not recommend it. The selection was limited and the price high. I would absolutely recommend the America restaurant. Service was amazing and the food excellent. The casino was small, crowded and noisy due to the night clubs. Tables were very quiet.I asked for a late check out and was willing to pay for it but was told to come back the day before we were due to depart. I was told it would cost between $50 and $65. Went back the day before departure and was told &quot;no we don't do that until the day of departure&quot;! Oh and the rate would be some place between $60 and $119. Guess what on day of departure I was told sorry ( at least I got the apology) no late check outs! Again a total lack of communication and no service. Quite frankly, while the rooms are a high quality, Circus Circus, 4 Queens, the Venetian and the Stratosphere all have better service. Next time will stay at a different hotel."
230,407,"Mar 4 2009 	Good for its location and restaurant choices	Rooms are OK. Staff are reasonably friendly. Travellers should be aware of the room rates as they change daily. You might have booked it more expensively than what it is when you arrive. I find this kind of pricing policy annoying, to say the least. How about introducing a lowest rate guarantee?? The casino was OK, but most dealers were not exceedingly friendly. You might do better elsewhere, e.g. at the Bellagio, etc.The reason I chose this hotel was for its access to the Cirque du Soleil shows (i.e. Ka, Zoomanity), which you can easily reach on foot or take the bus to the Bellagio (for O).There are also lots of eateries downstairs and at the other hotels nearby. My favourite was the Mexican place 'Gonzales Gonzales' for the food, not for the service however.Another plus point for this hotel is the relatively clean air. Some hotels, such as the Venitian or Mandalay Bay, seem to have the idea that an attack of chemical smells throughout their premises will increase guest comfort or make them spend more at the games. Sorry to the psychologists who thought this up, but it just induces feelings of nausea and puts people through an olfactory stress test. In summary, this is a good place to base yourself for visiting the major attractions this town has to offer. Definitely go and see the shows! They are world class."
231,407,Mar 3 2009 	No coffee pots in the rooms!	The hotel and casino are darker than most of the others with everything crowded together. We were told upon check in that the pool was closed only to discover as we checked out that it was open. The rooms were small to average in size and dimly lit. The water pressure in the shower was great but I bruised and almost cut my leg on the shower slide getting in. Beds were comfortable but linens were well worn. Housekeeping was wonderful and always had our room ready regardless of what time we left or came back. The restaurants that we ate in were average in quality but not price. My number one complaint was there was no coffee pot in our room and I had to go down 24 flights and stand in line each morning for about 10 to 15 minutes to get a cup or call and wait for a little longer for room service to deliver. I didn't ask about the coffee por because it has been years since I have stayed in a hotel regardless of how nice it was that it did not provide a coffee pot in the room. The casino was small and low payouts on their slots - we didn't try any of their tables. It took about 30 to 45 minutes to walk to the middle of the strip. Would not stay here again.
232,407,"Mar 2 2009 	NYNY is good but not great	It is not a bad hotel at all and since you try to spend as little time in the room as possible its OK. I got annoyed at them the 1st day when we got to the room the safe was locked so I called house keeping and they said 15-20 minutes. 30 minutes laster I called again, he was on his way. 10 more minutes I call again and was told he knocked but no one answered. BS unless he knocked with a feather. Annoyed but not pissed. CheckinNo problem and fast around 430pm on a Thursday. I asked and we were upgraded to Broadway room becasue it was my birthday.BedsWe had a Broadway room with 2 double beds. They were OK.TVSmall. Why do you have a &quot;newer&quot; room with a 19&quot; TV? (We did get free porn)SafeThey had a small wall safe in the room and it worked just fine.BathroomVery clean. It annoyed me that they replaced all the soap each day. What a waste. No problem with the hot water in the morning, afternoon or evening.Internet Was $15 a day I think. I didnt get it.FoodThere are a lot of choices in the hotel which is nice. The prices are really $10+ for lunch and up from there for dinner. Even a hot dog, fries and a pepsi costs $8. But that is to be expected in all hotels on the strip.CasinoI like the casino and it always seems to be lively. Like everywhere else its a maze. I think this place gets me more confused then most.CheckoutNo problem ad quick at 1030 on Sunday. I really expected a long line but there wasn't anyone. Overall its not a bad place. it is on the far end of the strip. I'd be happy to stay here again if I get a killer rate like I did this last time with player club."
233,407,"Mar 1 2009 	New York - New York Hotel and Casino	We stayed here for 3 nights (Fri., Sat., Sun.,) over Valentine's Day weekend in 2009.We waited about 5 minutes in line to check in. It took us a while to find the check in counter. We had taken on of the mini-buses from the airport that drops off people at any casino and they had dropped us off at a weird deserted entrance. We looked for signs to the check in counter, but there were none, we ended up having to ask twice to find it.We had room 777. We thought that they would have said something being a lucky number, but nothing was mentioned. The room was a standard hotel room with a king size bed. The view from the window was of wall. There was nothing to be seen. The bathroom was average size and the water pressure was strong.We put our our &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; and did not have maid service during our stay. We saw the housekeeper every day on our way out, and she always asked if we wanted service or not, as well, we had our sign out.There is a small restaurant that has a breakfast buffet in the morning, but the buffet is extremely small with very few choices - you are better off walking next door to the Excalibur or Luxor for a &quot;real&quot; Las Vegas buffet. There were several other restaurants and bars within the New York -New York, including numerous quick food choices. We did not eat at any of these.There is an outside walk way/ bridge from the New York -New York to the Excalibur hotel/casino, and then the Excalibur has inside walking to the Luxor and then inside walking from the Luxor to the Mandalay Bay. There is also an above the street level walkway to cross Las Vegas Blvd to the MGM from the New York -New York.The casino floor in the New York -New York is small compared to other casinos on the strip. There were lots of slot machines crammed closely together and not as many table games as other casinos.Upstairs there is a large area with games for kids and access to the roller coaster. We didn't ride it because we thought it was too expensive (it was either $12-14 a piece).The show at the New York -New York is Zumanity, which is an adult cirque soleil. We saw the 7:30 show. Get there when the doors open, as there is entertainment from the moment you walk in. We sat in the balcony. The theater is relatively small, so I don't think there are any bad seats. I wouldn't sit on the couches in the front row, unless you want to be part of the show. Overall, it was a great show!We took a cab to the airport when we left - the cab ride was $10.50 before tip."
234,407,"Feb 26 2009 	It was OK	This was a family trip with spouse and two adult daughters. We have all been to Las Vegas many times but this was first time staying at New York New York. Lady at check-in was wonderful and speedy. She upgraded us a little, and we had two rooms with nice view. Rooms were good and very clean. No complaits in the room department and price was very good. None of cared for any of the restaurants we ate at. Coffee shop for breakfast was blah. Mexican food was not great. Food was very expensive ($3.60 for a cup of coffee). Because our daughters were with us we elected to stay on the strip, but in the future we would prefer the area by Ceasar's Palace, Bellagio, Flamingo &amp; Bally's, if staying on the strip. When it's just my husband and I, we prefer staying at Sam's Town and visiting the strip on their shuttle. I doubt the any of us will stay at New York New York again."
235,407,"Feb 25 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	We booked online through their website and got a upgraded room with a strip view for the same price as a regular room. The room was clean and in good shape. We were on the 18th floor acording to the elevator, did not seem that high. The view was nice, we were able to see the sun rise over the mountains. The roller coaster could be heard. It was not an obnoxious noise, more like a loud ocean sound. the room was close to the elevator. Other rooms are a long walk from it as there is only one set of elevators and they were at the one end. We only stayed there 1 night and went to the Paris Las Vegas for the rest of our stay. I think the comfort was the same at both places. I was expecting more from Paris and they didn't deliver. I would definately stay at NY, NY again."
236,407,"Feb 25 2009 	Great Bang for the Buck	My husband and I decided to travel to Las Vegas for a last minute getaway to meet up with a group of friends. They were staying at the MGM so we wanted to be close to them without paying the MGM pricetag. As soon as we arrived we were able to check in very quickly (although, we arrived late at night and I noticed during the day long lines). They gave us a room with a great view of the strip. It was decorated very nicely, it really looked like a hotel you would stay in New York City. The bed was good, not great. The 1st night we ate at the Italian Restuarant, Il Fornaio and we weren't impressed. Although the next day we had italian speciality sandwhiches at the cafe and they were very delicious. We used the gym, while a little on the small side we were able to get in a good workout. I got a polish change on my fingers/toes and it was VERY pricey. One thing that really annoyed me was that I recieved 10 VIP bracelets for the club ROK so our group decided to go there so we wouldn't have to pay a cover charge. Well, they don't tell you that it only applies before 10 pm and we arrived later so we ended up having to pay $25 each and it wasn't a great club. There are so many great clubs in Vegas I wouldn't reccomend this one. All in all, we had a great trip and would def. stay at the NYNY again."
237,407,"Feb 25 2009 	Smaller and cozy awesome rooms	Ok, It is a very nice hotel. It is very suitable for crowds between 21-50. There are many places to go out in there and its not so &quot;Overwhelming&quot; that you just give up. It is has a very good location. You can see the MGM, Excalibur, Luxor and the Monte Carlo. The pizza is cheap and good. Everything is so expensive in Vegas. I loved our room. We were on the 26th floor. The maid came everyday and cleaned great. Very clean and had a reasonable price. I heard the rollar coaster was awesome. Our trip was so rushed. Plan on having at least 3 full days in Vegas to get the full effect. Its so romantic.."
238,407,"Feb 24 2009 	Atmosphere Lacking - Some Nice Rooms	Business trip with colleagues to NY NY as the hotel prices were very competitive for the location, amenities, and meetings. Staff was very cordial and welcoming. Rooms are refurbished but not to my liking due to being somewhat dated - low ceilings, pretty typical Vegas hotel type rooms. The Park Avenue Deluxe was very clean but dark with poor reading light . The bathroom was also dimly lit which was annoying. I requested a new room with better light for my second night stay and was accommodated on the third try. They really don't want you changing rooms without a good reason. My final room was a Broadway Deluxe and well worth a bit extra per night. Beds were comfortable in each room.Food was good at 9 Fine Irishmen, Il Fornaio, and Gallagher's. Business meetings had catered food and it was great. Great room service also."
239,407,"Feb 21 2009 	Just OK	We traveled during Valentines Day weekend. We have made several trips to Vegas so have other hotels for comparasion.Service: Poor drink service had to wait forever unless you were playing at a table. Check in was smooth and lady was very kind.Restaurants: Mexican restaurant was great and that was about it. Italian restaurant was a rip off. Poor service and way overpriced.Room: Very average, especially for the cost. We stayed in a Park Avenue Room that was tiny. Not the square footage that is advertised.Casino: Not a lot of variety. Pretty small in size. We pretty much left our hotel whenever we wanted to gamble.Shopping: Terrible. Come on this is Vegas. All hotels have a mall! Well except for this one.Bars: Only went to the Times Square Bar which was really fun except for a rip off in that you had to pay extra to sit down. That is crazy considering it isn't a night club it is a piano bar. The guys working there were fantastic.Overall I would give this hotel just an average rating. Nothing great or special. I wouldn't chose to stay here again. It wasn't that anything was terrible, but when you go to Vegas you expect more than this."
240,407,"Feb 21 2009 	Oh my god..	This place is fantastic.. an adults play ground. The hotel was great a bit blackpoolie with the carpets but oh my god how big is the hotel.. The food amazing a piece of pizza for 2 and is huge and so yummy. Am Irish piano bar that is packed every night and the americana restaurant that is open all night if you get the munchies at 4am!!There are loads of shops inside including two Hagen-Dazs, A Houdini shop, Coyote Ugly bar and nightclub upstairs, various clothes shops and of course about 1,000 slot machines, poker &amp; roulette tables. Not forgetting the awsome roller coaster ride that goes from inside the hotel out of about the 7th floor (I think) and loop the loops all around the outside. We where here as we got married in the Tropicana Hotel across the road, what a day they where great and it was well worth the money. This hotel is in a prime loaction on the strip and a little walk will take you to all the other well known hotels, all of which will blow you away. I could quite easily say we are addicted to Las Vegas and could easliy go back every year.We also did the Grand Canyon with Maverick helicopters booked before we went out. It is a little expensive but if you do the Sunset or sunrise is amazing."
241,407,"Feb 18 2009 	enjoyed the hotel	Stayed down the other end of the strip this time, Think we'll head back to the middle. Got to check into our room even though we arrived before 11 am. No smoke smell, but cost us $10 extra for a strip view, more like an airport view. Lots to do in the hotel and ate, at America, the pastry shop for coffee and muffins in the morning, Gonzolez &amp; Gonzolez, and 9 fine irishmen. Very busy told 96% booked. Nice having a car rental agency in the lobby. Rooms well appointed and cleaned properly each day. no noise from hallways or roller coaster."
242,407,"Feb 17 2009 	Worst hotel I have stayed at yet.	I have stayed at numerous hotels from New York to Europe to San Francisco to Disney world as well as many other locations. Up until this stay I have been happy with all the hotels I have stayed at except this one. Our room seemed like a closet that they threw a king bed and some furniture into. It was so tight if you opened the armoire door you couldnt get pass the bed until you closed it. The luggage bench or ottoman was stained with God only knows what (needless to say we didn't place anything on it or even touch it). The shower had horrible pressure as well as those stupid sliding doors. I have never seen a four star (make me laugh) hotel with sliding doors on their tubs. The room couldn't seem to stay at one temperature too hot, Lower the unit, whoa look out now to cold, guess what ? Thats right raise the unit. We must have played with that thermostat a minimum of 4 times a day over a 4 day stay. The way I figure it with my wife agreeing &quot;We must have gotten the hooker 1 night special room&quot;. As far as the casino if thats all you care about then no problems there. The restaurants were good."
243,407,"Feb 16 2009 	Bad Hotel not much to offer	1. The pool is shaded by the building for all but aut 3 hours out of the day. Because of this people start to save seats and crowd the pool early, but unless you're interested in getting up early an laying in the shade it is NOT fun. The pool is also very small and was overrun by kids.2. It is a pretty good walk away from most everything else. This is fine during the day, but after a nice dinner or going to clubs you will not want to make the walk back. And YES you will have to leave NYNY to find a good place to eat, or a good club. Most of the food is pizza, sandwhiches, or hot dogs. There is a good piano bar but because it is really the only decent bar it also gets very crowded very early.3. It was too much money, the rooms at MGM were the same price and lower for a MUCH better hotel. It was also very loud with the rollercoaster going by the rooms."
244,407,"Feb 11 2009 	Great Place with a few reservations.	My sig/other and I stayed at NYNY for 4 nights, and enjoyed our stay with a few caveats: 1) Though we enjoyed ourselves (we are a 50-something couple), the atmosphere really is geared toward the 20-30 year old crowd. Though I loved that it wasn't so big that we got lost but large enough to be an experience, I was not aware of the party attitude of the place and wasn't looking for it., but our room in the Century tower was quiet and that was all that mattered to us. 2) The sales reps! I did ask the desk clerk to perhaps mention it to the manager and will also follow up with a email (not that it will probably do any good). They are the ones selling time shares, and got quite aggressive with us--even hostile when we tried to ignore them. One has to run the gauntlet in most of the hotels we visited, so it's not just NYNY, but there I had to put up with one of the sales guys sticking a card in my (then) winning slot, only for it to go south almost as soon as he did. Bummer! I got real sick of them real fast, and don't know why the hotels are allowing them on-property. Other than that, our check-in was around 11 p.m. and went relatively quick--no last minute surprises. Our check-out for us was at 6 a.m. in order to catch a flight, and went even faster. The room we were given was slightly upgraded from the one I booked, for whatever reason--but we aren't complaining! We ended with a Park Avenue room. It was very nice, and came with the hair dryer. Room service was attentive and the room well taken care of.As a matter of fact, the entire hotel was cleaner than one would think given the amount of foot traffic going through. We went across the walk-way to Excalibur and was dismayed at the mess. Of all the places we visited, I did like NYNY best for cleanliness and friendlier atmosphere. We didn't eat at the restaurants there, but did enjoy the non-Starbucks coffee shop in the food court.I recommend NYNY for those who don't mind being on the south end of the strip and those who don't mind mingling with the younger crowds.We were there from Friday evening until Tuesday morning, and weren't bothered by prostitutes, though my sig/other was hit up for a smoke (he doesn't smoke) by a snakey looking character. But that was the extend of that. NYNY is convenient to Excalibur, Luxor, Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand."
245,407,"Feb 7 2009 	Good hotel with great atmosphere	This was my sixth trip to Las Vegas and stayed at New York New York. The following review will give you a good idea if this is the place to lose your money!!Location on Strip (7 out of 10)Not a bad location just not great. The location is good because it is connected to MGM which has a lot of action, gambling and otherwise but with Ceasars, Bellagio, Paris and Venitien located more north on the strip, your walks could get very tiresome. BUT this is very minor.Show (2 out of 10)Zumanity is the show that is at New York New York. Not a good show at all!!! Very amateurish and a waste of money. Spend the extra dough and go see Love at Mirage or KA.Gambling ( 7 out of 10)If you are a poker player, this is not the place for you. There is no poker room. But the MGM has a good room and the hotels are very close so not a big deal. The other aspects of the gambling floor were good.Restaurants (8 out of 10)Good food at good price.Atmosphere (10 out of 10)This is where New York New York excels. There always seems to be an upbeat, party atmosphere at any hour of the day or night. You will have people singing in the Piano bars, through the streets of &quot;soho&quot; and people yelling from the roller Coaster (which is a great ride)Overall (8 out of 10)If you avoid Zumanity, this is a great hotel that provides great value. I would recommend it for your bank withdrawal trip."
246,407,"Feb 4 2009 	Wonderful hotel great location	We stayed at the New York New York for 2 nights at the end of our USA trip. We had stayed in Vegas at the beginning of our journey, at the Luxor, but we wanted a better location.The NY NY is located within easy walking distance to the middle of the Strip. It is right accross from the MGM and from M&amp;M's world and the Coca-Cola store. We arrived by car and parked at the free hotel parking located at the back of the main building. It was just 5 minutes from parking the car to checkin.We were offered a 15$ upgrade to a better room (from a Skyline room to a Chrysler room) and accepted it as we would be on the 34th floor with a Strip view.The hotel is made of about 5 or 6 different towers, each with its own elevator from the casino.Our room was wonderful. It was large, extremely clean, with plenty of storage. The furniture was in excellent condition and the decoration was beautiful. As we were on the 34th floor we had an impressive view of the Strip and the airport. The bed was comfortable and I slept like a baby (I normally never sleep well away from my own bed).We had breakfast at the Italian-American restaurant in the casino and the service was impeccable and swift, and the food was good.We didnt try any of the other hotel services but all staff we were in contact with were very courteous.Our fare was very good too : about 70$/night/room .. unbeatable for what we received. I am looking forward to coming back to the NY NY and show it to my partner in October when I come back."
247,407,"Feb 4 2009 	Stayed there many times	We have been to Vegas many times and stayed at Mandalay, Luxor, Excalibur, Aladdin (now Planet Hollywood) . At NYNY we stayed 3 times and it was always great .I have to say that we always had a Marquis Suite so I don't know how it is with a standard bedroom. To book a Marquis Suite you have to call the hotel because you can't do it via their website (anyway once we were able to book it via expedia). The Marquis is a very nice room with Jacuzzi in the corner of the bedroom. You have a sitting area with couch, two chairs then a round table with other chairs. You have the safe, and then what my husband and I think is great is the Bose Wave stereo. The suite is very quiet you never hear noise from the outsite. We didn't hear the rollercoaster even if we could see it from our windows.The view from the marquis suite is not so great because if you have the strip view you will see the rollercoaster and also the windows are small at NYNY. Not floor to ceiling windows as you have at Mandalay or Planet Hollywood.The pool is very small and we never went there.The casino is cute but we used to go to Excalibur or MGM casinos.The Fornaio Backery is great to breakfast or also to eat some Panini (sandwich) during the day. We tried the Caprese Panino (Mozzarella, Tomatos and Oregano).There are also 2 Starbucks inside the NYNY.Next time we go to Vegas we will stay at another hotel just because we like to change but it's sure we will go to NYNY again someday.Check my pics .. I uploaded 2 different Marquis from 2 different trips. :-) one is on the 10th floor the other one is on the 36th floor"
248,407,"Feb 3 2009 	Stayed twice now 	I can't think of anything bad to say about this hotel - we've stayed twice and both times haven't had a thing to complain about. Looking at some of the reviews, maybe we were just lucky - but next time we go to Vegas, I'll be on-line booking this hotel again."
249,407,Feb 2 2009 	False advertising on their website	Website stated Strip View room which I booked. At check in we were told great Strip View room. Once we got into our room we found out it had no Strip view but a view of the freeway which was just under our room and the airport. We complained and were given another room with basically the same view. When calling the front desk the clerk told me there were No Strip View rooms and that all rooms faced the same direction. We checked out and went down the Strip where we did find a nice Strip view room for less money. False advertising on the part of hotel
250,407,Feb 1 2009 	NY NY Vegas	Great Rooms ! Casino crowded.. They offer free rooms to me all the time. I like the rooms but you can hear every noise in the hallway. Im not a fan of the casino.. Never been ot the pools. None the less its a nice hotel but i opt for other places if i have free offers
251,407,"Jan 31 2009 	There are alot better hotels in Vegas to stay at than NYNY	Booked NYNY on their website and received a followup email stating the tariff was going to be more that double what my printed confirmation was for a strip view room. I challenged them and they agreed we had the right to the room at the price I received from the online booking, however when we got to our room our &quot;view&quot; was totally obscured by a large advertisement on the outside glass. When our room wasnt made up 1 day &amp; I rang housekeeping, the female I spoke to rudely told me we left our Do Not Distrub sign on - which we hadnt! And to top everything off we received a phone call at 12.30 while we were asleep from the front desk saying someone was there to see me. I didnt go downstairs but investigated with the manager the next morning only to be told that they had no record &amp; someone was probably trying to scam us! As a mother travelling with her children this DID not make me feel very happy with the hotel as the phone caller had addressed me by name &amp; the hotel itself were the only people in town who knew we were staying there - I hadnt completed anything in Vegas that gave my hotel details. not happy at all that it happened but less still with the attitude of management"
252,407,"Jan 30 2009 	Nice for the price!!!	This is the 2nd time my husband &amp; I have stayed at the NY-NY. The 1st time was approx. 4-5 years ago. Loved it then and was surprised to see how different the casino was from a few years ago. I guess it was recently remodeled and looks fabulous!!! I know this hotel is popular with the young crowd, but there's a great mix of all ages here.  We checked in early Monday morning about 10am and our room was available then. The time it took to check in was minimal. However, the time it took to sign up for a players card was ridiculous! They have 2 older gentleman working behind the counter who can't type faster than 2 words per minute. Extremely slow.  Most all of the staff we encountered were friendly. The workers who work for &quot;Tahiti Village&quot; timeshare were quite annoying. They're the ones constantly bugging you with free tickets to shows or dinner. After the expierence we had from taking the so called tour, I'd like to advise everyone who's not truly interested in buying a 50K 1 week timeshare to by pass this 3 hour tour. I can see how people get pressured into buying something they cannot afford.  Our room was clean and quiet. Never heard any noises from the room next door. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were awful!!! They were small, thin and hard. We had a spa room that was very nice. We used the safe in the room. Wish they had a coffee maker in the room.  We ate at Gallaghers Steak House. They keep it very dark, so dark I could not read the menu. The food was good although very pricey. I ordered the surf and turf- $85.00. That's all you get, everything is ala carte. A glass of Merlot-$8.00. A shrimp cocktail in which you get 3 large shrimp- $16.00. Had we not had a gift certificate to eat there, we probably would not have just because of the cost. Each restaraunt has a menu posted outside so you can easily view the items they have along with the prices. We did eat at the America, good food, decent prices. One evening I had the steak and crab legs for $15.00 that included a salad, potato and steamed veggies!!! It was delicious and a great value. Had the breakfast buffet at Chin-Chins, very good.  The casino slots were very tight. Didn't see anyone hitting anything of substance. The tables weren't busy. We participated in the black jack tourney (1st time for both in a tourney) and took 2nd and 3rd place. That was fun for only a $20 entry fee.  The best and funnest bar at NY NY is the Bar at Times Square!!! What a blast. It's the sing along with the dueling piano guys. If you get there early enough, you won't have to pay the $10 cover. You can still watch the fun and hear the great music from outside of the bar, but the atmosphere inside and participating with everyone is by far one of the best times we had. A must do."
253,407,"Jan 29 2009 	Rooms as expected hotel better than average!	Stayed at NYNY January 18th-22nd with my boyfriend and his father. We tipped the front desk attendant and were upgraded one room category and had a nice corner room with a view of the roller coaster and strip. Having been to Vegas before and through a number of different properties, I was immediately impressed by the selection of restaurants in this hotel. Most places only seem to have a few options and most shut down late at night, but NYNY did not disappoint. In addition, it had a wide range of choices for any budget instead of all pricey options. Even the room service prices were incredibly reasonable by Vegas standards.Location on the strip was good and being able to easily walk to Luxor and MGM Grand was nice. We rented a car during this trip and found the self parking here was MUCH better than several other hotels we parked at (Planet Hollywood, Palazzo).Perhaps the best part about NYNY is the great club scene. Rok was a fun club and Studio 54 and LAX are a short walk too. If you don't want to dance all night there's also a piano bar that was packed every night and looked like a good time. On the flip side, don't bother shopping here.... head to Miracle Mile, Caesars or Fashion Show Mall instead as the shops at NYNY are minimal.Overall rating is a 4, although value for the price is wonderful at this hotel."
254,407,"Jan 27 2009 	Fantastic Views	We stayed at the New York New York for the last few days of our honeymoon and really enjoyed.The check in was very long even though we arrived very late at night, and each time we passed the front desk it was always very busy. But the hotel is very close to the airport so very easy to get back and fro.I e mailed in advance and requested a room at the top of the Empire State Building (The location of our engagement), a request they managed to make for us. We were on the 42nd floor and the views of the strip were amazing! Customer service was good enough as it was our first trip to Vegas, they gave us maps and helped with any requests.There are plenty of places to eat in the NY NY, we enjoyed the Italian and the Irish Pub, large meals, good value for money. The best entertainment had to be the dualing piano player. Hours of entertainment!It is well located on the strip, you can walk to most main hotels (avoid the people touting strippers like the plague, they are all over the strip and have no consideration for women or children), the monorail station is in the MGM Grand opposite.We enjoyed the NY NY and would stay here agin."
255,407,"Jan 26 2009 	Las Vegas amazing ... Loved New York New York.	Las Vegas has to be among the 'must go' destinations in the world and how the New York, New York lived up to expectations.My girlfriend and I stayed in a Jacuzzi room and I would recommend this upgrade for sure. The room was huge (like everything in Vegas !) and the hotel and Casino is set out in a village theme, with loads of eating / drinking opportunities for all ages/nationalities.The pool was amazing and chilled with music playing, though the drinks were slightly pricey there, they were big and worth it ! We are giving a review here about Vegas in general, a few pointers to pick the right location and things not to miss. Get on the right hand side of the plane from the UK when checking in, the window view coming through the desert into Vegas with the Canyon on you're right is amazing for those of you, like us, scared of taking a helicopter at a later stage of the holiday !The *New York New York * is opposite the MGM Grand and a perfect place to start off your journey down the famous strip !We went into every Hotel/Casino - Hooters is off the strip but close enough to walk to, it's one for the lads - say no more !A short cab ride to the Hard Rock - worth a visit.The Luxor, Excalibur and Mandalay Bay were behind us and to be honest a little too far out for our liking and not as good as the *New York New York.*Heading up the strip the Harley Davidson Cafe is a place you've gotta go to, the food is out of this world and if you like motorbikes and the rock n roll years it's the place for you.The Water Show outside Bellagio's is an experience to die for, incredible isn't the word. Caesars Palace is huge, and has a nightclub (Pure) and a fantastic bar (Pussycat Room) with world class barmen doing tricks galore. Along with the Venetian (Probably in our opinion the best hotel in the strip) and Mirage, these hotels are exceptional, bang in the the middle and in a great location to save on cab fares !We watched three shows, the Phantom of the Opera in the Venetian has to be the pick, truly sensational, get in the first ten rows for an amazing experience. Shoot &quot;Downtown &quot; about a 20 dollar cab ride, but catch the Stratosphere on the way, at the very end of the strip it's a great Hotel/Casino. If you are a Poker Player in Vegas for the first time, the tables are welcoming and you feel comfortable playing against the best. The Imperial Palace, centre of the strip, is also a good poker choice for the novice.The Stratosphere has a revolving restaurant (Top of the World) go there at night time the view is mind blowing - Vegas Lights from one end of the strip to the other. For the nut-jobs it has a ride that shoots you off the very top of the hotel at it's peak, 900 feet above everything in Vegas !Downtown has cheaper game play than the strip, the Golden Nugget and Four Queens are the best Casino's. The must go show to go to is &quot;Defending the Caveman&quot; in the Nugget. Either if you are in a relationship going nowhere, or like us one forever, you will find it funny and true to every couple's everyday life, it is also famed for sorting out sexual troubles, it will save you from those councelling sessions for sure !The light show &quot; Downtown&quot; was one of the highlights of our stay, Music and lights, won't spoil it for you - just go !For first time slot players, play &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; be warned you will get hooked !We saw the &quot;O&quot; by Cirque du Soleil in Bellagio's, not really for us, but can understand the enjoyment in some people's faces and work put into the whole show - so professional.The Cabs have a free Vegas guide, make sure you pick one up.Keep to the main streets, tip the waitresses a dollar when playing in the casino's and your drinks will be plenty and will keep on coming !As for shopping, &quot;Las Vegas Premium Outlets&quot; is the place to go, damn hot ( touching 100 !) but the prices are cheap for designer gear ! Bit further along from the Stratosphere - again a cab ride from the strip.As *New York New York *goes, for atmosphere, customer service, rooms, food and the Vegas experience it's a fantastic choice. A truly wonderful hotel and casino. The American breakfast bar/diner is fab.&quot;Mon Ami Gabi &quot;close to the Paris hotel is a fantastic Parisian - style restaurant.Next time we go ( one five day trip to Vegas isn't enough !) we are looking at a more Central Location, like the Mirage or the beautiful Venetian, but in the *New York New York * we will one day return !"
256,407,"Jan 24 2009 	Awful experience...	the location is awesome. The room was not clean, and there was an awful smell coming out of the bathroom. We called the front desk and 2 hours later somebody showed up to clean..."
257,407,"Jan 24 2009 	Place to party...	For all young couples who want to get away and let it all go! My g/f and I go to Vegas once a year and stay at the NY NY every time. We love being around the younger crowd and enjoy the ROK and Coyote Ugly bars. This location is great, on the further south end, yet close to most places. The rooms were plenty big and service was outstanding. We slept later into the day and when we would leave the room I would just call and our room would be clean with in the afternoon. Go if you are young and want to kick it."
258,407,"Jan 22 2009 	Nice hotel nicer slots	My GF and I decided to get married in Vegas and we decided that we would stay at New York New York. The reason for this was that we wanted to stay in one of 'Mega Resorts' and it was a hip place for two 24 year olds.The room was nice, comfy bed, nice bathroom and a safe. The only bad thing was the view, the chain lift of the roller coaster and the Project City Centre building site. The view wasn't really a problem as we would rather be on the strip than looking at it from our room.When we arrived we decided to have our bags taken by the bell hops to our room once we had checked in. This was the best thing as it took us 25 minutes to find the registration desk. Once we finally got there, the staff were friendly. Not being a huge gambler, I stuck to the penny slots (won 174 dollars) and $5 black jack. If you are a novice like me I would suggest watching a few hands and try to find a nice dealer.The hotel has lots of bars and food places all which looked nice. The only places we tried was the ESPN sports bar (get there early when NFL is on otherwise you wont get a seat) and small bar near the escalators which go down to the csino. Although a bit pricey, it was still good.All in all I would stay at NYNY agin as it has a great location in reffrence to the airport and other hotels including the monorail station at MGM."
259,407,"Jan 17 2009 	New Year's Eve 	We checked into the NYNY on Dec. 28 and Checked out on Jan. 1, 2009.The purpose of our visit was to get married on the 31st and bring in the New Year at the Bridge Bash, located on the Brooklyn Bridge at the NYNY.We booked two rooms Park Ave. with strip view, and many of our guests stayed at the NYNY. Check in was fast, we requested our bags to be brought up to our room; it took about an hour for the bags to arrive, which I thought was quite reasonable for the amount of people checking in. The Hotel left us a message to apologize for the delay and reduced our first night rate by 25.00 for the inconvenience. Both rooms were clean and seemed to have been recently updated. All the staff was polite and helpful. Overall our expectations were exceeded at the NYNY. Would highly recommend this hotel anyone."
260,407,"Jan 17 2009 	NYNY Is Great!	I booked on the hotel website 8 months in advance, and checked again 10 days before leaving the UK and noticed there was a much better offer available. I cancelled the original booking for no charge, and re-booked for the better offer which saved us $250 over 5 nights.We arrived at about 4pm on New Years Eve, and check in took less than 10 minutes. We stayed in the New Yorker tower, in a Park Avenue room overlooking the roller coaster and facing the strip. I was concerned about noise from the roller coaster, but apart from the occasional scream, I didnt really hear it. It stops at 11pm, except at the weekend when it stays open until midnight. I was very surprised that hotel guests still have to pay $14 for 1 ride  at that price I didnt think it was worth it.We were disappointed that the room did not have any tea or coffee making facilities  we really thought a 4 star hotel should offer this, but we were told to call room service instead (obviously for a charge)!The room was a good size, although starting to show its age. The carpet had some stains by the window, and if you pulled the curtains back you could see the wallpaper was peeling away and the plaster was crumbling. The safe is built into the wall, and is very small. You could not put a laptop or SLR camera inside. We had just enough space for our passports, wallets and mobile phones. The room had a large CRT telly with about 30 channels. The beds were very comfortable.There was a good all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet at one of the casino restaurants, and the America restaurant had an all-day breakfast menu with most items $8 to $12. There is no buffet for an evening meal, but you can easily walk to the MGM Grand or Luxor, which both have an evening buffet.This was my first trip to Vegas and overall I was very impressed. Although the NY NY is at the bottom end of the strip, there is a bus that stops outside the MGM Grand, and goes all the way to the other end. It is only $5 for a 24 hour pass. My only other disappointment was that the pool was closed for the winter period, and there was no inside pool, but apparently no Vegas hotel does."
261,407,"Jan 13 2009	Don't let the bad reviews keep you from staying here!	Went to Vegas for the NFR and cowgirl daughter's 21rst birthday. Was skeptical after reading negative reviews, but got a decent rate and decided to go for it. We haven't anything bad to say about our hotel experience. The staff were super friendly, actually exceptional considering the amount of people they deal with and check-in was a breeze. We asked for adjoining rooms or as close as possible and staff worked with us, we were one room away from each other! I couldn't believe it! Hotel elevators and casino were easy to navigate. We stayed three days in Park Ave view rooms (view is really the roof of casino and roller coaster which wasn't operating) Room was tastefully decorated, clean and roomy especially the incredible bathroom. As far as the casino, I had not been to Vegas for years and was shocked at the prices of everything from a beer to a Nathan's dog. Cocktail service was sketchy at best at the slots. Slots were not loose and tables are $$$. We watched the Steelers win at the ESPN zone which was fun but again overly expensive. Had it not been raining/snowing I think we would have went elsewhere for our gambling and dining, especially since NYNY is centrally located. We were also disppointed with the removal of the &quot;Central Park&quot; trees and the bizarre construction of the middle of the casino floor, very very tacky looking."
262,407,"Jan 12 2009 	Good for families	This was a good hotel for families, room were adequate, not huge, food choice great and plenty for the kids to do. Its huge bur good value for LV."
263,407,"Jan 10 2009 	Awesome Hotel!	We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and it was fantastic!The rooms are very clean, the service was amazing and the location is perfect.The casino area is smaller then the MGM but still enough casino to have loads of fun.We loved the NY-NY!"
264,407,"Jan 9 2009 	Great casino nice rooms	Stayed 4 nights (arrived Saturday) at New York-New York, Las Vegas, with my husband, also had 2 friends staying at same hotel (all under 30). Good sized rooms, nice bathrooms, comfortable bed but noisy air-conditioner. The casino was really cool, lots of places to eat &amp; drink. Nothing fabulous about view from our room on the 32nd floor. Will stay at Treasure Island next time if the price is similar, looked really fun &amp; centrally located. However, will stay at New York's again if cheaper than TI. Don't waste your money on the train to get around the strip, the buses are much quicker, cheaper &amp; you won't be walking as much. Suggest you plan your trip to be here on the weekend no matter what the cost, this town can get pretty quiet on weekdays out of peak season."
265,407,"Jan 6 2009 	Dream (Match) Come to Life	I love Manny Pacquiao and saw him fight live two times in '08. Here was my opportunity to see him for a third time since he was showing up in Vegas again to fight Oscar De La Hoya. Although tickets were sold out the day they were released, I was fortunate enough to get them less than a week before the actual fight. Prior to deciding to get the tickets I had to find a place to stay for my girl and myself. After weeks and weeks of research, I decided NY NY was the best deal in town. Since the fight was at the MGM Grand, the location was close enough to walk (a bridge length) and at the same time save some money compared to the surrounding hotels on the strip and the MGM itself. My girl and I stayed for 2 days in the Skyline room accommodation and were very pleased to say the least. Our room had nice views including the roller coaster facing MGM. The bed, pillows and sheets were pretty comfortable. Good size room with ample space in the bathroom is all we could ask for. However, the casino itself in my opinion is not my favorite. I'm not a big gambler so I don't really care, but what stood out in my mind was the relatively small size of the layout of the casino and especially all the smoking going on which irritated me greatly. I'm fortunate and grateful that NY NY had affordable rooms available during this exciting weekend event. Had they not, I probably would not have been motivated to locate fight tickets and been able to attend and witness the beat down of De La Hoya by my main man and idol, Manny &quot;Pac-Man&quot; Pacquiao! Yee!"
266,407,"Jan 3 2009 	A disappointing stay at NYNY Hotel	My husband and I decided to take advantage of Travelocity's Vegas packages and spend 2 nights at New York - New York. We've stayed in Vegas before, at Excalibur. In the past, we walked through NYNY's casino and were impressed with the air filtration, but not this time. We booked a Park Avenue room, and upon check in, we easily upgraded a non-smoking Spa Suite room. The upgrade cost was $55 for the weeknight (Thurs, 1/1) and $90 for the weekend night (Fri, 1/2). Our room was in the New Yorker tower. We were surprised there was not a staff member asking to see your room key like Excalibur has before accessing the elevators. Our room was tastefully decorated with a clean spa tub. However, a significant amount of the grout in the shower was black with mildew and in a few spots appeared to be damaged due improper repair or so badly damaged from mildew and mold it appeared to be rotten. It made me wish I brought flip flops to wear in the shower. There were knobs missing from the chest of drawers and the picture quality from the satellite TV was poor. What is the point of a large flat screen TV if the picture quality or reception is bad. The casino's air quality was poor. We ended up gambling in Excalibur, Luxor, and Mandalay Bay instead. Our dinner at Nine Fine Irishmen was great. We've never been disappointed with Nine Fine Irishmen's food or service. On both mornings around 8:00 am, we were awakened by groups on people shouting in the hallways. Upon checking out, we reported the mildew and received a $20 dollar credit for each night. In the future, we'll stay at Mandalay and only visit NYNY for dinner at Nine Fine Irishmen."
267,407,"Jan 2 2009 	Once again we love NYNY	This was our 6th trip to Las Vegas and our 4th stay at NYNY. As a point of reference we have also stayed at the Mirage and the Aladdin (now Planet Holleywood). New York New York still remains our favorite. As a sidenote, we had a free hotel room offered to us at Hooters Casino. Two days prior to the trip we decided not to chance a new hotel that was not directly on the strip and paid to stay at NYNY. What a great choice! We checked out the room we would have had at Hooters (ok but not what we would want on a trip to Vegas).Check in was easy. We had an offer through the Players Club which gave us great rates and a Park Avenue Deluxe room. I asked for a room with a good strip view and we got it. We were at the corner of the hotel with a view of the strip, the airport, and the mountains in the distance. Loved it. Our room was just as I remembered, comfortable, fairly contemporary, and clean. That's all we need in Vegas.We played mostly at NYNY because we really like the vibe there. Everything seems to be laid back. Our drinks were comped everytime we sat down at a table or machine. And service was fast. (We are tippers-so this might account for the fast and attentive service-we usually tip a dollar a drink) I mention this because we had a bad experience at the Mirage-we found the Mirage to be impressive but not our style. I can't describe it other than we sit at 10 dollar tables and play 25 cent machines. We are not high rollers and were treated as such. On the other hand we always feel comfortable and taken care of at NYNY.We ate at both ESPN Zone, Americana, and Gonzales y Gonzales. All of our meals were good. My husband is a big sports bettor so ESPN Zone works out GREAT for watching the games. The food is good, not great, but its a sports bar what can you expect. Americana is a great choice for breakfast. Once again food was good and service was excellent. Gonzales y Gonzales was really good and the margaritas were GREAT. Our favorite new touch to the hotel is the circular bar in the middle of the casino. The bartenders were great and there was always a seat available for video poker.I think this casino/hotel is great if you want a laid back, fun, young environment. If you want the wow factor, this is not the casino for you. My parent are travelling to Vegas this month, we booked them at the Wynn (thats more there style). As for us, NYNY is perfect for a relaxing fun trip."
268,407,"Jan 2 2009 	A really nice hotel. I would definitely stay here again.	We stayed in an upgraded room which was quite large. My only complaint was that the bed was covered with an old fashioned bedspread that had probably been used again and again. Other than that, the room was very clean, the mattress, very comfortable. The bathroom was modern and large. The problem for some guests might be that the room overlooked the rollercoaster. The noise of the rollercoaster was not the problem but the screams of the riders could be heard. The rollercoaster did not stop running until 12:00 p.m. so if you are a light sleeper, it might be a problem. It was not for us."
269,407,"Dec 30 2008 	Okay	First stay at this hotel (usually room at MGM, Mirage or the Venetian), but received a 3-night stay at NYNY just before the Christmas holidays. The room was a Park Avenue Deluxe on a corner of the hotel with wrap around windows. A nice touch, but the room was small compared to other hotels on the Strip, and felt crowded even with a couple of bags. Linens fading with wear, the room is getting old and is in need of a reno.Hotel staff was friendly, but the restaurant food was below what you would expect (unenjoyable really) and over-priced. Nightlife is always fun in NYNY, but on this trip a couple of the bars/pubs were closed until 2009. Definitely a good enough hotel to get some sleep since it is in a good location and easy to catch a taxi, but would not recommend if you are looking for a hotel to call home on your trip. You wouldn't stay here for the gaming, eating or entertainment.Also - the pool looked incredibly small. Would not want to stay here when the pools are open in Vegas. You'd be very disappointed. If you enjoy wasting a better part of your afternoon by the pool, stay at MGM, Venetian, Casears, etc."
270,407,"Dec 28 2008 	Decent but much better options. Very rude staff uncomfortable astmosphere.	We stayed a couple nights at the New York, New York after I recieved a promotion from being a member of the playersclub. We usually stay at other MGM properties, but figured we would give the New York, New York a shot as the casino and hotel do have a funky young feel to it. However, there are very clear warnings that go along with this hotel that did sour the experience;First; Check-in/out. The front desk in this hotel is woefully under-staffed and very inefficient. There were long lines when we checked in and out. The hotel check-in is also visible from the casino and it did not seem that our experience was any different than most peoples (even at odd times of the day!). The most glaring example was a very large line at 7am one morning. Staff: I was quite shocked by the rudeness of the staff in the hotel and the casino. Maybe they take the New York theme a bit too far? there is no reason to be overtly rude to people. Some examples were being completely ignored for drink service (one time we actually asked for drinks and were dismissed by the waitress with I'll get around to you' - she never did come back after several hours.. Other examples were people getting chewed out at the front desk and playersclub for legit errors (from what I observed waiting in the obscenely long lines). Food: There are several food options in the Hotel, All of them incredibly over-priced (even with the 20% off coupons that they dish out!). None of them very appetizing. Avoid the ESPN Zone, completely smoke and mirrors place - it was one of the worst restaurants I have ever had the displeasure of eating in. Frozen burgers, really? Thats just lazy, cheap and stupid (esp for $15!).Rooms: Decent and well decorated rooms, but not terribly clean.. mold rampant in the bathroom. Looked as if it was a very cheap build, grout falling out, mouldy silicon interface of the tub. Sink counter-tops not installed properly. We had to request a new room after the first night as they put us directly beside the elevator shaft - don't bother accepting this room if you can help it, you won't sleep. They didn't really question us too hard when we asked for a new room, a few others in line were asking for the same reason. I guess the desk staff is used to it.Value: Well, unless they give you the room extremely cheap or for free I would suggest staying elsewhere. We don't vacation to feel uncomfortable. The Monte Carlo is a much better option and usually a comparable price.. although an older and more subdued crowd there."
271,407,"Dec 27 2008	Loved the New York New York	Daughter wanted to see Las Vegas for her 21st birthday, so I did alot of research before choosing the New York, New York. I was glad I made the right decision. Getting to the hotel from the airport was easy - a five minute taxi ride. We arrived at 10:30 AM Pacific Time so I was a little concerned about not being able to check in for a few hours, but no sooner did we get out of the cab that a bellman came over, tagged our luggage, and held it for us until our room was ready and we could call to bring it up. Checking in at that hour, there wasn't anyone at the registration desk so we checked in right away. I asked for a roll a way bed as we had three people in the room and the queen size beds weren't going to big enough for three people. Since we booked our plane and hotel reservations through US Airways, there was no charge for the rollaway and the registration clerk ordered it for us. We did not have to wait for our room to be ready and after we grabbed a quick bite to eat at the American Restaurant, we checked out our room and by then the rollaway had already arrived. After placing the call for our luggage it took no more than 5 minutes for it to arrive at our room. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The ambience of the hotel was overwhelming. The American Restaurant wasn't so great so we ate there just once. We at twice at the Chin, Chin Cafe, like their chinese food and their prices were reasonable. We also ate there for breakfast. The night of my daughter's birthday we splurged at Gallagher's. Although the food was excellent, it was very pricey. The village eateries, which had an array of eaterys (Starbucks, Ben &amp; Jerry's, fish place, dessert eatery, Nathan's hotdogs) was picturesque with tables set up all throughout which made it appear that you were eating at outdoor cafes. You couldn't hear the noise from the casino, so it was a good place to escape the noise, smoke and music if you wanted to. The roller coaster was OK, not the best ride I ever had, very bumpy. The shoulder harness should be replaced with over the head/chest harness like other roller coasters and the headrest was not cushioned. My shoulder's and neck hurt for three days after I rode the ride. I wouldn't ride it again. Alot of archade games for the kids on the second for those kids who under 21 - something to keep them busy. Hotel is across the street from the MGM Grand where you can catch the monorail. This hotel is conveniently located."
272,407,"Dec 24 2008 	Incredible Views Excellent Service	Check in was a breeze. We got there about 7 at night, and we waited like 3 minutes in line. Even though the rate I booked was under the &quot;Room Upgrades through 2009 Free&quot; program, I tried the $20 trick to make sure we got a better room. The person checking us in declined the tip, and gave us the upgrade. And boy what an upgrade! Yeah, it was just to the next room size, 400 sq feet total, but the view was incredible - we had a corner room, 20th floor, with a view of the strip and the airport - and the sunrise, when we cared to get up that early (or stayed up that late!). The bed was as comfortable as the Temperpedic we have at home.Yeah, we had to tip multiple times for baggage service - once to the person taking bags from the car, and once to the person bringing them up to the room. But hey, that's Vegas. Just about everyone we talked to there was knowledgeable. When we accidentally kept the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign on the room one night, there was a message on our phone when we got back late offering to get us fresh towels, which was also excellent. While the Casino is as big as most of the others in Vegas hotels, it was easy to navigate. Never got lost, and it was easy to find the restaurants within.And the rate was less than the Motel 6 down the road. An excellent deal in our book!"
273,407,"Dec 23 2008 	Loved it...would recommend to anyone under 40....	Great stay. NY NY has something for everyone. Good food, great bars and helpful staff...I would definately recommend the Bar at Times Square - drinks are expensive but worth every penny for the atmosphere..."
274,407,"Dec 23 2008 	Still like it but loved the old design	The construction is finally done at this hotel. And my first impression---big disappointment. I loved the old hotel because it reminded me of parts of NYC when I was in the lobby. Now its all neon and weird spacing. Its like they forgot their theme was New York City. Im also not impressed with the new Central bar. It looks like something new and modern and stark. That is so not New York City. Basically the hotel lost its personality in trying to match newer Vegas hotels. On the plus side, the 24 bar next to Coyote Ugly rocks with super friendly bartenders and Gallaghers still cooks a mean steak. I also suggest going to Il Fornaio in the lobby for a quick casual bitesandwiches, salads, pastaI dont think Ive ever had anything bad there. Simply fantastic food and you wouldnt know by passing it. Club---The nightclub ROK is also finally open. We, as women will lol, got in free and they had free champagne all night. But let me help you---buy a drink. Cheap champagne = nasty! The club itself, while on the small side, was fun and service was fast. The bathrooms are unisex so be ready when you walk in. The crowd leans toward fun, drunk and ready to party vs. posers ala Pure nightclub so we liked it. Hotel roomIve stayed here enough to know to stay in the Broadway rooms. They are older but much bigger than the new rooms. And theyre still clean and very decent so the age isnt showing badly at all. I hate paying for internet but whatever. Would I stay here again? Sure, because the fun 30-ish people stay here, lol. But it's going to take me a second to forgive them for going neon tacky."
275,407,"Dec 17 2008 	NYNY left something to be desired	Before we arrived at the hotel, the players club informed us as long as we played, they would comp our food and drink. My husband and I brought what we could afford budget wise due to the economy and played blackjack the entire time. The last day, my husband went to the players club and was informed we would not be comped anything. As it turns out, they do not start to comp you until you have spent $1000 gambling. Not only had we spent most of our time in the hotels when the card was applicable, but we made sure to eat there as well - for no reason! So the deal is that if you have money and don't need the comps, that is when you get reimbursed. It is very disappointing to see a business run like that. Most of the dealers that we had in the hotel were rude and rarely smiled despite us trying to get them to joke with us. One actually made me feel downright uncomfortable so we left the table. The gaming area was incredibly small compared to all the other hotels. The good things I can say the room we had was nice, though our friends' was run down. Gallegher's is a very good restuarant and the bartenders at The Bar at Times Square were excellent. That being said, we will not be going back to that hotel again."
276,407,"Dec 14 2008 	great stay	We got a great deal when we booked it through the hotel's website. We were upgraded to a Park Ave Deluxe room with 2 free drink vouchers, 2-for-1 rollercoaster ride and other offers. The room had two queen beds that were very comfortable. The bathroom had a small fridge with ice maker hidden under the sink. The shower's water pressure was the best! Both the room and bathroom were very clean. The service was magnificent. The pool area wasn't big enough. We weren't able to use our drink vouchers at the poolside bar, even though we were told that we were able to. We went on the rollercoaster late at night. It was a great experience. The food/restaurants there are great. Overall, I had a great stay."
277,407,"Dec 13 2008 	Cool hotel	There was a good buzz about the hotel, loved the walkways connecting it to the MGM and the Excalibur, made exploring easier! Stayed in one of the players suites, huge room, only had a view of the carpark, but we didnt spend much time looking out the window! The hotel is slightly old, but it wouldn't put me off this place. The food court was great, the pizza slices are to die for! The best thing about the hotel however was the dueling pianos at the bar at time square. this was one of the highlights of our stay, i cant express just how much fun it was! Those guys are so talented and great entertainers! just be prepared to bring some cash if you want to get your song played!! And dont let the $15 charge to sit down put u off - stand for free, makes dancing easier!!"
278,407,"Dec 12 2008 	Had a great time!	Stayed here Nov 30 to Dec 3rd and loved every minute of it. We arrived quite early in the morning, around 10am, and a room was ready and prepared for us. The room was clean, quiet and had a nice view of the Rollercoaster, which was kind of fun. The bathroom was pretty big and the shower was great and the bed was super comfortable.We got a good deal on the room and loved the location, and could catch a bus on the other side of the pedestrian bridge by the MGM. The casino/gambling isn't top notch but there are so many casinos to gamble at, that it more than sufficed. I was looking to play some poker, and just walked across the street to the MGM and played in their poker room, as it's nice to switch it up from Casino to Casino anyway.Check out was easy, the &quot;food court&quot; area downstairs had plenty to offer at all hours of the day and overall the experience was great. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for good place to stay in Vegas that is close to everything you need."
279,407,"Dec 11 2008	Will try another hotel next time	Location: Excellent. On the south end of the strip which was close to most of the casinos/activities we wanted to see/do. The main shopping area is mid-strip though, so would not stay here if your intention is only to shop (only a 30-40 minute walk to the shopping area though). Or you can take a tram.Room: We stayed in the Park Avenue Deluxe. Nicely decorated, quite clean. We requested a non-smoking room with a king bed and we received a non-smoking room with two queen beds which was fine. My main complaint was the noise. I booked this hotel fearing I would get a room close to the coaster. It was not as bad as some others have described it, but it depends where your room is and how high up it is. I could not hear the coaster with the TV on, and it stops running before midnight, so not a huge deal, but just something to be aware of because the constant rumbling is there. The walls are paper thin and I could hear every conversation going on next door even if they were talking normally. Drove me crazy since they were up until the wee hours of the morning talking. I also found the mattresses and pillows to be extremely uncomfortable.Overall: Because of the noise from the coaster/hotel neighbors, and the extremely uncomfortable beds, I would not stay here again. I only paid about $100 US a night though so I had a pretty good experience based on what I paid. If I had paid more though I would not have thought it was worth it. What I did like was the location (and the elevators up to the room were very fast) but will try the MGM Grand next time."
280,407,"Dec 9 2008	Okay I guess	Stayed at the hotel from Dec 4 - 7 2008. When we got in, right away we smelled the smokiness inside..blah. Check in wasn't a problem. Our room was okay but our bathroom was small. Our 1st I checked out our hotel....that was it as I mainly went out on the Las Vegas Strip. It was a busy since there was the Rodeo event plus the De la Hoya - Pacquiao fight at MGM Grand (next door to NY NY Hotel). The walls were &quot;paper thin&quot; as we can hear our neighbors. Plus also some people was so loud out on the hallway waking us up at 3am in the morning, but hey it's Vegas! Overall we may go back to NY NY for the price...but prefer to find a better hotel."
281,407,"Dec 8 2008 	NY NY - Take It Or Leave It	My husband and I stayed at NY NY from November 26th thru Novemebr 29th. Check-In was a breeze....our plane landed us a bit before 11:00am and we were at the hotel by 12:00. They did have a room ready for us...standard/king. I asked for a strip view and they wanted to charge me $15 per day. I told the clerk that the mountains are just fine for me to look at...who goes to LV for a view, anyways. The room was nice...nothing too special. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The only problem, there was no happy medium to the temperature...it was either cold or hot. One morning, we could hear our neighbors very clearly, I thought they were in our room, but we were leaving to go onto the strip, so it was not too bothersome...but be advised, walls are thin. I was a bit disappointed with the casino itself. The table games were great...friendly dealers, good minimums, etc. However, I enjoy playing the slots as well and their slots were not special. No fun games...I like Elvis, Wheel of Fortune, Top Dollar, etc. It all seemed the same and nothing to WOW me. Other casinos, however, had the same table games and better slots, so I went elsewhere the majority of the time...Monte Carlo had $5 table limits and better slots.As for the little restaurants in NY NY, nothing to write home about. The pizza shop was disgusting...the bottom of my supreme slice was so greasy that my pizza was actually soggy. Left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least. Nathans was much better for that quick bite to eat. DO NOT eat at the pretzel shop upstairs for a snack unless you have a taste for cardboard. We were disappointed on Thanksgiving...no buffet or good specials at NY NY. We walked over to MC and ate at CAFE for a great turkey dinner. I cashed in some points for a free dinner. The food there was yummy!!!! When are stay was over, check-out was simple. I requested a later check-out and they granted me a noon check-out instead of 11:00am. All in all, NY NY was okay...I have stayed better, I have stayed worse. I think that NY NY is losing their pizazz from the very beginning of their opening...they are going downhill. I hope they can pick it back up because I used to enjoy it!"
282,407,Dec 3 2008 	New York New York 1st anniversary in Vegas	I was very skeptical about staying at this hotel because the reviews were so random. I must say that it was a nice experience. There was nothing extra special or extra horrible. The room that we had was the Park Ave Deluxe room and they said they upgraded us to a better view. I must say that the room was a lot smaller then I was use to but we made due. We had a really nice view of the MGM and the roller coaster. The staff was rather pleasant and I loved the pizza shop in the hotel. The roller coaster ride was AWESOME! As a native New Yorker I thought it was a cute rendition of the city. Vegas was wonderful and the hotel was just cool nothing to write home about. The room was clean the bed was not hard and room service was rather quick.
283,407,Dec 2 2008	Sept trip to Las Vegas	Stayed the middle of Sept for two nights at New York New York. Unfortunately the lobby construction did create a high noise factor which detracted from the gambling experience. The staff was polite when there was a misunderstanding about our on-line booking and we were granted our Strip View Room. The roller coaster did not disturb our sleep. Also spent one night on Treasure Island. The beds were wonderful. Great View. Ana from New York checked us in. I had read a bad review about her attitude but she was very courteous to us. Great experience at Treasure Island. We enjoyed their casino the most. TI breakfast buffet was delicious.
284,407,"Dec 2 2008	Decent at best.	I stayed at NYNY Nov 24-26. I booked my flght and hotel with NWA.com, and paid $305 for flight and hotel, so I got a great deal. On my previous trips I always liked going to NYNY and wanted to stay there. Unfortunately they have changed the coolest part of the place. The casino used to be themed after Central Park, with trees and green park-like structures over the playing tables. The trees are gone and the structures have been replaced and are now topped with weird neon lights. Upon check in I asked for a room away from the roller coaster, the front desk person said no problem. I was put in room 2101, a Park Avenue room. Getting up the to 21st floor the room just happened to be on the far end of the hallway, so there was a long walk from the elevators. The room itself was nothing special, a little on the small side. It appeared the decor had recently been redone, but TV was still the old tube style. The bathroom was tiny. The last time I went to Vegas I stayed at Planet Hollywood and their bathrooms were almost 3 times the size of NYNY's. Not only that but the towels seemed to be quite old, as they had lost the softness to them. They seemed like towels you would get at a Holiday Inn Express. The shower was also a combo with the tub, I prefer them seperate but thats not a big deal, it had good water pressure. The bed was decently comfortable, a little firm for me, but I guess that is personal preference. Of course I looked out of my window, which was overlooking the pool, and there is the &quot;drop&quot; in the roller coaster. The noise wasn't too bad from it but you could hear it, especially if people were on it and screaming.Getting out of the room, went down to the casino. Being that Vegas's tourism is way down, the limits were the lowest I have seen them at NYNY, at almost anytime you could get a $5 blackjack table. Granted most of the them were usually with the auto-shufflers. The sports/racebook sucks. It is small with some individual monitors for race bettors. With ESPNZone next to it, it seems that this is their way around giving drinks out to bettors, since ESPN's dinning room, looks like most other sportbooks. I went down to Bellagio to watch the Saints-Packers MNF game and put down $50 on the Saints. I was given free drinks (Jameson/Cokes, and Vodka/Redbulls.) then entire length of the game, without the server even caring if I put down a bet or not.I only ate two places at NYNY, one was great the other was not. One of the best reasons to visit NYNY is the pizza place. Great pizza and not too expensive. I was able to get a regular slice of peppironi and a beer for $8. The other place I ate was ESPNZone. This was not that good and was quite expensive. I had asked for a cheeseburger and got some sort of mayo on it. Most places I usually go do not have mayo on it, that aside the burger just wasn't very good. Which is sad since the night before I was able to get a great burger at Kahunaville, at NYNY's sister hotel Treasure Island. I went out to the hot tub on tuesday morning, mostly to soak the feet after a day and night of walking around, and was planning on going back later, but it was closing at 4pm. I found this odd, I would have figured pools in Vegas would be open almost 24 hours, well at least the hot tubs, but whatever, maybe this is their way of getting you to upgrade to a suite.Overall I was not impressed with NYNY. I think the only way I would stay there again is if I was going to a fight at MGM, as it is right across the street. Other than that I would stay farther north on the strip."
285,407,"Dec 1 2008 	Lower end hotel	This is hotel 3 of 4 for the week. We stayed at 3 others just so we could see the whole strip and experience different things through the week.We arrived early here, and after the long walk to the hotel from the parkade we were able to check in earlier. Upon check in the desk staff pushed to spend the extra 20 a night for the bigger room, it was definitely not worth it. The room was almost too big, and not worth the money. The whole floor smelled bad, and just didn't appear to be even dusted. The beds were good enough to sleep on, and the shower was quite tiny, just don't look at the vent in the shower, as ours was really disgusting as it was packed and I mean literally packed with dust. The shower didn't drain all that well, neither did the sink. The food was horribly over priced here, and wasn't all that good. We ended up walking to the Luxor and the Excalibur, and for all being owned by the same company. The other 2 hotels were amazing, the Excalibur had a great food court, so did the Luxor. The shopping was better in the other 2 hotels, and for some reason as pushy as the time share people are down there, they seemed to be even worse at the new york new york. It's a good location but I would never stay there again, I would stay at the Excalibur as it's not that much more. The location was ok, we walked across to the MGM grand to catch the monorail, which is a great value by the way. And we did the strip that way it's much easier and felt safer too. We got off and walked to the Bellagio and watched the fountains, and began the half an hour walk back to the new york new york, it really didn't look that far!Gambling there was a waste of time, 3 of us lost over 60 bucks in 15 minutes, ON PENNY MACHINES. We had much more fun at the Luxor, or even Caesars palace. All in all, this hotel was not worth the money. It was old, It was dirty, and just plain boring. There was not a lot to do at this hotel, there wasn't as much shopping as there was in the Excalibur or the Luxor. The only thing I can recommend is if you stay here, walk across to the MGM and look at the lions, they are amazing."
286,407,"Nov 30 2008 	New York New York - Nice But No ""Vibe""	My wife and I recently returned from a four-night stay at New York New York Hotel to celebrate my birthday. We stayed from November 17th to November 21st and although this was our tenth trip to Vegas, this was our first stay at NYNY. From worst to best, the other hotels we've stayed at have been - Circus Circus, Bally's, Planet Hollywood, Treasure Island, Mirage, and Venetian. Among those hotels, I would have to place NYNY between Bally's and Planet Hollywood. The look of NYNY was quite impressive, but I found the over-all vibe somewhat lacking. More on that later. The hotel is designed with a mixture of 1920's art deco and modern New York style, but the combination works. The valet area where the taxi dropped us off looked like the grand entrance to a 1920's hotel. The front desk is located only a short walk from the valet entrance and the front desk personnel, as well as the valet, were very friendly. We booked the 5th Avenue Deluxe package that gave us a free upgrade from a standard Skyline room to a Park Avenue Deluxe room and believe me, the room looked just as nice as it did on the website. The hotel rooms are divided among four towers - the Century tower, the Empire tower, the Chrysler tower, and the New Yorker tower which is where we stayed. Each tower has it's own bank of elevators with about ten elevators in each bank serving certain floors. The result is a very short wait for elevators going up, or coming down. The halls to the rooms look as if you are in an apartment building. The smaller the last two digits of your room number are, the further you are from the elevator. We were in room 1408 so we were pretty far. The room itself, although kind of small, was very nice and cozy. It felt more like an apartment than a hotel room. The room had a king-size bed, two cushioned chairs, an ottoman, a marble table, two bedside tables with lamps, an iHome radio with iPod dock (The radio won't work with the iPhone), a writing desk and chair with a large mirror and lamp, an additional lamp in the corner, and a large armoire with closet space on each side which holds the iron and ironing board and three large drawers. The armoire also holds a 32&quot; T.V., but it's not a flat screen like many other hotels are upgrading to. The bathroom is all marble with a shower/tub combo with sliding glass frosted doors. The bathroom wasn't that big, and the water pressure left something to be desired, but it was nice all the same. Some rooms have foyers like ours did and some don't. We had a free safe on the wall in our foyer. You punch in a four-digit code and you can use it as much as you want. The safe won't fit anything big, but it works for small valuables. The room we were in had a wall of windows on the south side facing Flamingo Ave, and on the east side facing Las Vegas Blvd. The armoire was in front of the east windows though, but that was okay we still had nice views and lots of sunlight in the morning and lots of neon light at night. We also had a direct view of the roller coaster a couple hundred yards away, but the noise level was barely a whisper. As nice as the room was, we did encounter a few problems. The comforter on our bed had some questionable stains and hair on the underside. We called housekeeping and not only did they change the comforter, but they changed all the sheets as well. The housekeeper told us that they change the sheets after each guest, but not the comforter, but they will if the new guest requests it. We also had a burned-out light in our armoire, and our iron didn't work. Both problems, along with the comforter situation, were handled quickly and very professionally. The comfort of the bed was okay, not bad - not great. It felt like a regular bed, nothing like the bed at TI which is the best bed I ever slept in. Our package, along with the free upgrade, also included two free drinks redeemable at Nine Fine Irishmen pub, or Pour 24, the 24-hour bar on the mezzanine level, a 2 for 1 ticket for the roller coaster, discounted spa treatment, and a 2 for 1 breakfast on the patio of the Italian restaurant Il Fornaio. The coupon is for your entree only. Not for sides or beverages. We ordered French toast and it was delicious. They do great coffee, eggs, and bacon as well. They are definitely worth a try. Although we didn't swim, we visited the pool which is open until early December. The pool is very small and under the shadow and noise of the roller coaster. Not relaxing at all without much sun. When I said earlier that NYNY lacks a &quot;vibe&quot;, I meant that there's not much to keep you there. It's nice walking through the recreation of the neighborhoods, but they've taken out most of Central Park to replace it with a casino bar which, as of this writing, is still under construction. Their shopping is virtually non-existent consisting of a few souvenir shops, a watch shop and one &quot;upscale&quot; clothing store that looks just like another souvenir shop, and you can find equal or better food choices at other hotels. There is no buffet although the Asian themed Chin Chin has a daily breakfast buffet. The bars like Nine Fine Irishmen and the dueling piano bar have live music, but you have to buy two drinks in the afternoon, and at night they become just another pretentious spot with doormen and a cover. The Coney Island arcade is cool, but if you're not a kid or if video games and cheap prizes for tickets aren't your thing then you won't care. The casino is not well organized, and the sports book is tiny. They also have time-share and rental property sellers at practically each entrance - inside the hotel. We've all seen them by other hotels, but to have them inside the hotel jumping you coming and going is very annoying. One thing I can say though, is that during the time we were there the weather was amazing (sunny and warm every day - cooler at night) and the crowds were incredibly thin with hardly any kids around. The lines for the clubs were so short that your chances of getting in were very good. In fact, they were practically begging for people to come in. Check-out was very quick, in fact, you can check out through your t.v. and drop your key off at the key deposit by the elevators, but only if you haven't incurred any in room charges. Check-out is normally 11:00 a.m., but if you need an extra hour you can call the front desk and request a 12 noon check-out for no extra charge. Like I said earlier, NYNY is a very nice hotel and you should try it, for the right price, but aside from the fact that my wife and I don't like to visit the same hotel too many times anyway, I can't really see returning to NYNY when there are other more exciting hotel choices. By the way, if you are looking for some entertainment and food choices, you can't go wrong with these - For burgers In N Out Burger is the only way to go. They have the best burgers I ever tasted and I visit them every time I visit Vegas. They are far less expensive than the over-rated Fatburger but many,many times better. Also , you may not believe this but although Circus Circus is hardly one of the best hotels in Vegas, they have the absolute best steakhouse. The steakhouse in Circus Circus has been voted the best many times and when you eat there you will see why. They have the best atmosphere, the best service, and the best food. Many steakhouses are a la carte meaning you have to purchase your entree, salad, potato, and vegetable separately, but here you get all that, including bread, with the purchase of your steak. I can't begin to describe how delicious every morsel of food was, but if you love steak try the Steakhouse at Circus Circus. Also if you are a fan of magic you would do well to check out the Steve Wyrick show at Planet Hollywood. I've seen Lance Burton four times and I've loved it each time. Lance has an endearing, engaging, fun personality and fast paced show perfectly suited to his classic magic and illusions. I've also seen David Copperfield, and for all his amazing tricks, I found his show slow, dull, and his personality felt as if he was phoning it in. Steve Wyrick is a mixture of the two. He combined Lance's personality with David Copperfield's amazing illusions. Steve's tricks, though, I felt were better than both of them. His theater is so intimate that every seat was a good seat and even though his show was hardly filled to capacity, he acted as if he were playing to a full house. Simply put, he was amazing. Check him out. I hope you enjoyed my review, I tried to be as thorough as possible, but as with any review just use it as a guideline but you can never really know until you experience it yourself. Enjoy!"
287,407,"Nov 29 2008 	New York New York city that never sleeps!	My boyfriend and I decided to get away for a Thanksgiving holiday. We both really enjoyed our 3 night stay here. We upgraded to the Broadway room for only $20 extra per night. Our room was in the NY Tower with 6 gigantic windows that lined the whole side of our room. Wonderful view! Plenty of options if you want to grab a quick bite-NY Pretzel, Nathans, Pizza (yummy, stick to the thin crust), 2 Starbucks (one is open 24 hrs), Mexican and Irish fare, and much more. We ate dinner at the famous Gallaghers (since 1927 in NYC). It was delicious! You wouldn't even of thought you were in a casino.  Do not miss the Times Square Bar with the dueling pianos...I've been to places like this before (Pat O'briens) and they don't hold a candle to the excitement here. True professionals! I would definitely stay here again!"
288,407,"Nov 28 2008 	Good service room middle of the road	Stayed 10/23 and 10/24. Park Avenue RoomService was good, from valet staff to front desk staff to others we encountered.Likes- The room was clean- iPod dock clock radio- Comfortable bedLiked less:- Room was not near the elevator, as with most of these large resorts. However, because of the design of the hotel I felt like I kept walking around corners until eventually I found my room. It was a bit disorienting- 18 floors up and the view out the right side of my window was another part of the hotel. Not much to see- Bathroom - little bit dated and worn, but still clean- No hotel buffet, only in one of the restaurants - food was good but small selection for the price by Vegas strip standardsWould stay here again if the price is right. Did find that since most of what we like to do is further up the strip, we ended up walking a lot just to go back to the hotel room for a rest..."
289,407,"Nov 28 2008 	I've Stayed Here Many Times But This Most Recent Visit Is Probably My Last	I have stayed at New York New York many times in the past few years, and I've always enjoyed it. My last stay before this most recent one was a year ago, and things have definitely changed there at the hotel. I was there from November 23rd to the 25th, 2008. I was very disappointed to discover that they are in the midst of redecorating and retheming their casino. Gone are the many artificial trees that made it seem like one was in Central Park. They even ripped out the stream and its bridge, and now it's all been covered with flooring and carpet! Instead of the many graceful trees, they have added these garish, modernisitic sculptures over the gaming tables and throughout the casino. They have strips of lights on top that change colors. They look very tacky and non-descript, and they are ugly. I talked to one of the game operators, and he said that they are trying to go for a more modern, sleek, hi-tech look in their casino. They are also building a circular bar in the center of the casino that will feature many, many flat screens TV and blaring rock music to add to that sleek, hip, modern feel. This bar will be called &quot;Rok Vegas.&quot; The previous bar that was there was, I believe, called &quot;The Big Apple.&quot; The rooms are still decorated the same. Mine was in good condition. I was on the 30th and had a great view of the Strip (which I requested when I made the online reservation a month ago). I always enjoy eating at the restaurant there called &quot;Nine Fine Irishmen&quot;. The food has always been delicious. The prices are a bit on the high side, but it's worth it. When I ate there a couple days ago, they had live entertainment downstairs playing Irish-type music with singing. It was fun! There is NO buffet at New York New York, so I recommend going to the Planet Hollywood Hotel's buffet which is called &quot;The Spice Market Buffet&quot;. For $30 for dinner, you get food from around the world! They have a Mexican, Italian, Mid-Eastern, Chinese, Japanese, American, and dessert section. The food is incredible! Very high-end and very delicious.I am really disappointed that New York New York's casino is in the process of being totally re-designed and rethemed to look &quot;modern&quot;. I thought the Central Park theming was really unique and made it one-of-a-kind. Now it looks very ugly and plain. It lost all of its charm, in my opinion. I don't think I will be staying there again due to the drastic theme change in the casino.Also, I got charged twice for in-room Internet access. I caught that billing error upon checkout. They fixed it immediately.Still a fun place to stay (ride the roller-coaster!), but the casino is undergoing major changes that I think really detract from the overall experience. Like I said, I will probably begin staying elsewhere when I visit Las Vegas."
290,407,"Nov 27 2008	I HOPE TO SEE EVERYTHING NEX TIME	We couldn't pick a better place to stay in Vegas; there is so much to see and enjoy at New York New York...from our window we watched the sunrise above the montains just before crashing after partying all night. I am sure every room has a great view. The Zumanity Show was awesome too!! The only little thing I have to share that perhaps it's not so good, is the fact that the only restricted floor is the 36th. floor; all other floors can be accessed by anyone and being Vegas, that was a surprise to me. I am sure they have great security but, in the mean time, who knows what could happen to any drunk person trying to make it to the hotel room...may be I'm not so used to be away from L.A. huh?Anyways, it is a great place and I look forward to staying there the next time I visit Vegas...."
291,407,"Nov 26 2008	Good Hotel in a Good Location	Very nice hotel. We were part of a group celebrating a 40th birthday party and 10 couples attended and stayed at this hotel. Overall the hotel was clean, no need to nit pick as you dont spend much time in the room anyways. The staff was friendly, not out-going, but friendly and the options for dining and entertainment were fulfilling. The dueling pianos were fun, while the ESPN Sportszone was always happening with the college and NFL games going. The gaming area I would say, could use a pick me up (Blah). Not much excitement, with the exception of the sports book and its location next to the Zone. Club Rok, none of us ever made it in, but we heard it was nice and a place to see/be for late hours. We did however enjoy a nice meal @ Galaghers and further enjoyed sitting outside on the patio @ the Nine Fine Irishmen Pub/Snug. You wouldn't even know there is an outside patio.Previously we seen Zumanity, very cool and sassy show.The location of the hotel is about 15-30 minutes from other casinos and attractions. We made it a point to stop @ Harrahs Carnival court and O'Sheas. Both offer different levels of entertainment, while O'Sheas is more of a bar / casino and Carnvial Court is an outdoor area with shops / bar / stage / bands etc.In closing, New York - New York is nice, not elaborate(Venitian), but adequate for a fun stay in Las Vegas and I would definitely stay here again."
292,407,"Nov 23 2008 	Always something going on	Stayed for two nights 11/20-11/21 and had a great time....my wife and I play alot so we built up a lot of table comps quickly...make sure you use them before you leave....they expire when you leave. We ate at Gallaghers Steak House and liked it and then tried the ESPN Zone for lunch and it was so-so, the wait for food to come out was too long and the wings were raw....but again it was paid for with comps so I didn't get too mad. The location is great for seeing the rest of the strip....all in all a good couple of nights"
293,407,"Nov 20 2008 	Great Value for the money	NYNY is a very good value for your money, to sum it up. Read more:I actually booked the price for $130 a night, bur a day before I was supposed to check-in, I went online and saw that the price was showing $100. I called them and asked if they would honor the new price and they did, which is great.We checked in Satday afternoon, and the only minus i saw was that out of 15 check-in counters, 5 were open which is ridiculous. The wait was about 20 minutes, but that's ok.The rooms are very neat, very contemporary and spacious. We got a Park Avenue Strip View and it was awesome. Linens were clean and comfortable, and there is nothing to complain about the room.Only minus I felt was there was no Internet access in the room. In this day and age, you'd kind of expect this to be free. There's no place in the hotel to take printouts for free, atleast to take printouts of tickets etc.Other than that, great stay, and very good value for money !!!"
294,407,"Nov 17 2008 	some frustrations	My husband and I spent four nights at the New York New York to celebrate our 20th anniversary, and in all honesty we would probably not return. Six weeks prior to our visit I had phoned and requested a king bed in a room that was not a long walk from the elevator. I explained that this was due to health reasons which sometimes make it difficult for me to walk long distances. We checked in at about 10pm, and finally got to our room at about 10:30. We could not have been further away! I phoned immediately and was told that was all they had but that they would move us in the morning. Upon receiving our new room, we noticed it was the exact same suite number, just ten floors higher! Again, I explained. This was the third time now. Their solution? I could take the elevator at the far end of the casino, then I wouldn't have such a far walk to my room. Hmmm. That makes sense.(!?)Other than the room issue, the restaurants were good. The room was ok. The lighting in the bathroom is pathetic. The casino was fairly quiet, which was fine for us. In hindsight, I would have prefered to be further down the strip and more central. We took cabs everywhere (because of the walking issue) and were impressed with the gentlemen working the cab desk outside...lots of good tips and suggestions. One last annoyance was the time share people working in the hotel. Steer clear!"
295,407,"Nov 17 2008 	Some good points some bad points	We stayed at the NY NY as part of our honeymoon in late October 2008. Having been to Vegas before we picked the NY NY as we knew it was central on the strip and from walking through had numerous options for dining etc. Plus we wanted to see Zumanity, so we figured this was a good place to stay. The positives - its central to all on the strip. The theatre has Zumanity which is an interesting and quite funny Cirque Du Soleil show. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable. The bed was huge which you need after a day walking the strip.The negatives - the hotel staff were really disinterested when serving us. alot of the little food places downstairs never seemed to be open and the staff in them where fairly rude. The famous bar with dueling pianos was somehting we really wanted to do, but there was a $10US cover charge, just to sit in the bar - I think they would make enough from drinks etc that they wouldnt need to charge that. When we checked out we explicitly told the front desk person that we were checking out but going back to our room to get our bags. When we went back upstairs our keycard wouldnt work and we were told that we would have to call security. After another couple of &quot;where are you?&quot; phone calls we were finally let back into the room by a very ubrupt and rude security person and we felt like we had troubled them even though it was there mistake. This also caused us to miss our shuttle bus to the airport.Overall, the hotel is in a good spot and does have some very good points. But the staff were a very big let down and really spoilt the experience."
296,407,Nov 16 2008 	Good value	Stayed here for 2 nights to get the &quot; Las Vegas experience&quot;. Hated Las Vegas but were glad we went to see for ourselves. Hotel very comfortable. Good sized room and bathroom (although we had better elsewhere for the money) but it was clean. No fridge in room - presumably they want you to buy your drinks downstairs!! Iron and ironing board in room. We had an upgrade to Park Avenue deluxe room which had a view of the strip and the airport. This hotel is at one end of the strip so it is a long way to the other end if you want to see the Freemont area.We ate dinners and breakfasts in the hotel restaurants. Food fine but very busy on our second night (a Monday) and we had some difficulty getting a table. Several fast food outlets if you want that sort of thing. Valet parking efficient.Overall a good option if you don't want to go over the top with price to stay at the Bellagio.
297,407,"Nov 12 2008 	Don't waste your money	Wouldn'r recommend this hotel..to many other nice hotels at the same price. When we arrived and were told prior to arriving to check in at VIP, when attemping to check in I was told sorry VIP is closed..basically go wait with everyone else....ok no problem. Then they didn't have the rooms we booked available. Finally got settled in and went to play on the tables, the asian dealer asked my son for ID which he provided then she threw it back at him and landed on the carpet....totally rude so we didn't gamble at the hotel for the 7 days that we were thier. Good luck trying to find a chair at the pool if u don't get their by 8:00 am..they have this massive hotel with one tiny pool and a roller coaster zipping around over your head. I called management to express my concerns regarding are stay considering it wasn't a cheap holiday. I spoke with the director of the hotel and she basically told me she would address my concerns with staff...no offer of come back and we will try to get are act together....I thought we might get a comp dinner or show to take the sour taste out of are mouths, but nothing. I understand things go wrong but... when you save and only have one holiday a year and it's not cheap u except it to be better...special in Vegas.So in turn I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.Cheers,"
298,407,"Nov 12 2008 	Short Stay at NYNY	Since I don't gamble, I am not really a Las Vegas person. However, my wife was attending a brief sorority reunion at the New York New York in Las Vegas, and basically demanded that I come along.New York New York seems to be fairly typical of the huge Strip hotels - thousands of rooms, numerous restaurants and shops, and a casino. Las Vegas appears to be hurting financially right now (Fall 08). We were upgraded to a 2nd tier room for the basic price and given some free and 2-for-1 coupons. Several locals said business is way down the last 6 months, so hotels may be hurting for business with all those rooms to fill.The room was nice enough, with a comfortable bed. There were a few chintzy touches - the shower doors didn't work properly and the television receives surprisingly few channels, but there were no major problems. Staying at the NYNY is probably similar to staying at any of the other big Strip hotels, so shop around."
299,407,"Nov 12 2008	New York New York: Good Room Weak Casino	While the room was clean and more spacious than most hotel rooms, the casino itself lacks luster."
300,407,"Nov 11 2008	Could have been better	My husband and I stayed there for our honeymoon. Like some previous reviews have mentioned, the basic room is super small. We were upgraded because on our first morning there we were woken up by some construction. That's right...some of the other more recent reviews have mentioned construction. Well it looks like a year later they're still at it. They still required hotel guests to leave a credit card number to use their internet. I can't believe a huge casino still charges for internet use. Get with the program. Needless to say we did not hang out at our casino for very long. We ventured out and about more than we were in the room. Oh yeah...steer clear of their roller coaster. The shoulder rests left indentions and popped some veins in my husband's shoulders that were bright red for a week after he rode the thing."
301,407,"Nov 11 2008	Good Choice	We stayed at NYNY 3 nights mid Oct, in a double queen bed room for 2 couples. Arrived in early afternoon, and we had booked a non smoking, but they only had a smoking room, so we took it, rather than wait. Thankfully, the room didn't smell, as I am really sensitive to smoke!! Room size was great, with good sized beds and bathroom. However, by this stage, for the money we were spending in 4-5 star hotels, I was getting a little tired of showers over baths, and this is something I would research a little better for next trip. These configurations, especially when old, are terrible - they have very limited adjustments(pressure/temp) and the spray type can sometimes be uncomfortable...not good when your paying top dollar. This was the 3rd leg of our trip, from LA, SAN FRAN. We were booked in to get married at Stratosphere on the last day, and this turned out to be a great experience for an informal type ceremony. The hotel is located at the southern end of strip, which makes for some lengthy walking if you want to explore the 'newer' looking casino's. Not to say NYNY looks overly old itself. However, be prepared for the imposing, rude and extremely annoying sidewalk antics of people attempting to hand out 'escort /prostitute services literature. I found this really awkward, walking up and down the strip with my fiance/wife, and my friends. On the 1st night, when walking back to our hotel, one of these guys said something in Spanish, of course, to my partners sister. I couldn't help myself and swore at him. He heard me, and we almost got into a fight, when the lights changed, he kicked me and ran off. I would have been hesitant to retaliate, with so many of them there. This left a foul taste in my mouth about Vegas generally, and that confirmed to me I would never come back. However, next day upon a cancelled trip to the canyon, because of a mix up, I used the Hotel gym - for an additional 18USD!!!, (GREAT GYM THOUGH) and had a mini bucks night out - blackjack at Caesars Palace with pussycat doll dancers! I don't gamble - first time player, and I won 130 BUCKS - I was very happy!!! The girls went to Cirque show and absolutely loved it! That evening we all ate togethr inside Venetian. This was fantastic - beautiful interior - my favourite, and a variety of 'normal' priced restaurants. I found it very hard, walking through other casino's, to find a well priced eatery. The Venetian however, was at the opposite end of the strip to NYNY, and thus I would aim to stay here, if I went back. America,good priced eatery in NYNY, as was Rainforest in MGM across the road. There was even an Australian I think 'Outback' restaurant which was open late down the strip which was good. Ate lunch at Stratosphere Top of the world before wedding and it was really nice, and great value...you'd pay similar anywhere on the strip and here you are on a revolving restaurant high in the sky - brilliant! After the ceremony etc I booked us in at PANEVINO near the airport, with a great view of the strip. For a lovely meal, treat yourself to this place, an excellent, after wedding dinner!! The Mirage was pretty cool on the inside, and would like to see their wildlife habitats if we returned. If only the local authorities stepped in and got rid of those annoying literature/ticket dispensers!!! Oh, my partner and friend went on the roller coaster on the last night and said it was a buzz! Gym at cost of 18 dollars is a bit cheeky, would be good to know that up front, and also internet minimum of 5 dollars too. Overall, a nice establishment, but I preffered the other end of the strip and thus would either stay at that end, or look into the Marriott properties, which the cab driver told us are great, off the strip."
302,407,"Nov 5 2008 	Loved New York New York	What an experience! I will definately stay there again next year. The hotel staff was top notch. Even the housekeeping employees were so polite and friendly. There was plenty to do and lots of restaurants to choose from. If you do end up staying there, you have got to eat at Gallager's steakhouse. DELICIOUS! It was my first time in Las Vegas and I am so happy to be fortunate enough to stay at New York New York!"
303,407,"Nov 5 2008 	Nice hotel on the strip	The hotel was allright - nothing fancy. It is right on the strip, the room was big enough, but it could use a better cleaning. Service staff was good. After all I would say it is a little bit too much money for what you get..."
304,407,Nov 3 2008 	No problems but nothing special either.	I booked 3 nights in July for my birthday. The girlfriend was along for this trip. We checked in in about 20 minutes. They were working on some construction in the lobby which maybe finished by now. Our room was clean if not the biggest. They wanted extra for internet access which I have not seen in several years now. In the evenings the Casino lobby area gets crowded. People every where. Sometimes it is hard to walk through. Be careful not to get separated from your party. Most of the clientele looked like they were from NY. T-shirts gold chains tattoos. Not a classy crowd.The first evening we walked around the Casino. The food and drinks are very pricey - like NY. The next day we ventured out onto the strip.We soon discovered some gems. Reasonable beer food etc. Bills Gambling Hall. Much classy places like Caesars and the Venetian.Vegas has plenty. Next trip we're staying in old downtown Vegas.
305,407,Oct 30 2008 	Fun at New York New York	We booked our room through vegas.com for 3 nights for a rate we considered good value. The room was a decent size and the amenities nice (although a fridge would have been useful). The location of the hotel is convenient for accessing the Strip. The restaurants in the hotel/casino are pricey and the quality varies from venue to venue. The roller coaster was great fun!Staff were friendly and helpful.Overall a fun place to stay in Vegas.
306,407,"Oct 30 2008 	Nice hotel nice upgrade!	Stayed at the NY NY in May 2008. It was very nice - the casino is great - but I still preferred the MGM across the street. The first night we stayed in the basic room - and it was soooooooo small! I wasn't very happy, but they would not upgrade us at all. The second night, we used our points to upgrade to the Ziggarat Suite. This suite was bigger than some apartments I have been in! The windows were tinted green, which was different - but kinda cool. The bed was amazing! The jacuzzi was a 4 person tub and came with bath beads - so great! We got slippers and bathrobes - and chocolate cherries at turndown service time. The restaurants in the casino were okay - a little pricey - but thats not uncommon in Vegas. We ate at the pizza place and the ESPN Zone - both were pretty good. But, if you want a great buffet - go next door to the Exalibur - it was great and a decent price. We also got a free breakfast at the MGM which was awesome as well!I would definitely go back to Vegas - but I think I would stay at the MGM over the NY NY. I really would like to try out the Venetian, Mirage or the Wynn. Those are mid-strip and close to all the action. The NYNY &amp; MGM are about a 5-10 min walk to the middle of the strip which isn't bad at all!"
307,407,"Oct 29 2008 	Yes I was surprised that...	....I was surprised that I actually enjoyed my stay. After reading a few not so great reviews, I was pleasantly surprised with our visit to NY NY. We stayed on the 6th floor in the New Yorker Tower (which is a great location by the way!) Awesome view of the air conditioners (LOL). The room was dark, but tastefully decorated. Not as old as I thought it would be. No stains, no dings in the wall, no shower mildew. Pretty nice. We had dinner at Gallagers and Il Fornaio (sp) and had lunch at America. All were decent. There is some construction going on right in the center of the casino, not a big space, but, it does make you walk around. Hopefully they are adding a nice sit down lounge area. Most of the changes that they have made to the resort/casino are good. However there really is no place just to lounge, sit back and relax. Not a lot of energy in the place!Overall a great stay - easy access to all that there is on the South Strip!"
308,407,"Oct 27 2008 	We had a brilliant time	Had looked at all the reviews on Trip Advisor for Vegas prior to booking, We were not disappointed - had contacted the hotel regarding upgrading - special occasion - all dealt with. Checking-in very swift and very customer focused. Got a room with a strip view - clean, good size, suited us well. OK the television didn't have many channels , and there is no tea/ coffee facilities in the room - but who is going to stay in their room when there is so much to see and do. We booked Mama Mia , and Barry Manilow - great evenings, but the highlight was the Grand Canyon trip with Sundance helicopter company. Picked up from the hotel in a limo - smooth ride in the chopper, right mix of commentary and chat by the pilot - and then a picnic on the canyon floor - and if that wasn't enough -the final flight back along the strip. Some quick tips. Use the deuce bus system - great value - and you see all the sights on $5 for 24 hours Must go and see the Fremont Street experience Buffets at the Monty Carlo great value"
309,407,"Oct 17 2008 	NYNY ROX!	We arrived on Thursday, Oct 9th, my friend had VIP check in through the frosted glass, we had to wait awhile but we were served drinks and they had selection of nuts and candies, fruit and coffee, tea, water, very nice. After a few min, there was a mishap with my friend, so we actually had another friend give us her keys, it was a PARK AVENUE room in the NEW YORK TOWER, the elevator bank was just across from Galaghers. We had room 3850 or 3950 ( cant remember ) but it was a corner room and right around the corner of the elevators! The room was big, 2 queen beds, 2 chairs and a small table , a comfy bench by the curtains, the entertainment center had 2 clostes, and the TV was not updated, just a standard tube TV. The view was amazing, we had MGM on one sideand Monte Carlo on another, since it was a corner room we had all around view. The bathroom was small, the shower/tub was all in one, with marble, VERY SLIPPERY, make sure to put some towles on the floor!  There was a desk in between the beds, with a phone and a small desk lamp, my aunt really enjoyed the 15x magnifying make up mirror in the bathroom. The only thing negative is that they leave messages everyday, to tell you about sales in the gift shop. I left housekeeping a note with tip each day and they left us our chocolates on the made up bed and extra towels and toiletries! I would come back and stay here most definately! They had construction going on in the casino ,but it wasnt annoying and the music from the club lasted all night while we were playing in the casino."
310,407,"Oct 15 2008 	Fun place to stay	This was our first trip to Vegas, and my friend came in from France for the trip. I booked this through a travel agent and really had no idea what to expect, but was told that this a good value for the money -- not the absolute cream of the crop, but decent. I would have to agree. Our room in the New York Tower was average -- not great, but clean and warm. Just a little bit worn and not new. I was surprised there wasn't a mini-bar in it. The view was great, we overlooked the strip. The people of the hotel were top-notch, everyone was friendly, smiling and helpful. This included the staff during check-in and check-out, the people at the Zumanity box office, and the casino people who were quick to help when a machine malfunctioned and didn't give me my $9 winnings. :) The location was great. One complaint is that we were given a 2 for 1 coupon at Il Fornaio restaurant for patio breakfast before 10:30am. It turns out there are TWO Il Fornaio's in the hotel. We stood in line at the wrong one for a time, and when we got the the RIGHT one at 10:33, the man said it was too late for breakfast and wouldn't serve us. He was actually quite rude, the only person we encountered like that during our trip. The live music at the Times Square Bar was a gas, and there was a 24-hr restaurant which we made use of a couple of times, All in all, I'd definitely stay there again."
311,407,"Oct 12 2008 	Great Time	My husband, My Godmother, Mother and I stayed at NYNY from October 6th to October 10th. The hotel was great my husband and I had a spa suite for the first three nights and the Park Avenue room with premium view for the last night. The Spa suite was great it was spacious and had a great view of the strip we really enjoyed the Jacuzzi in the room it was very nice to relax after walking the strip all day long. The Park Avenue room was okay it also had a nice view but it was a little small and the TV wasnt great. Checking in was very easy and smooth we stayed in the Century tower and it was a great location. We ordered room service a few times and we all thought it was very good even with the high prices. We didnt really eat that much but the ESPN Zone was pretty cool the baseball games on Friday night. They were very fast and the food was okit was a little pricey. We also tried the America restaurant this was a great restaurant the food wasnt that expensive and they give you huge portions and they have a huge variety to chose from. The casino was very nice it was a little on the small side with the construction going on but it wasnt too crowded and the staff was very friendly. Rok night club was really cool and we didnt go to the Times Square bar but every time we walked by seemed like everyone was having a blast. We went to check out the roller coaster and it was 16.00 bucks to ride it kind of pricey if you ask me and just beware if you are in some of the rooms you can hear the roller coaster and the people yelling on the roller coaster late at night. I would say the only downfall for this hotel was the pool area it was way to small and you had to get out there really close to 10am when they opened or you wouldnt get a seat and the sun doesnt come over the pool until about noon. Check out was great and our flight didnt leave until 1130pm so they held our bags for us and got them within seconds when we had to leave to get to the airport. Oh and one last thing I wouldnt suggest taking the bus it was terrible. If you have any questions please feel free to email me at [-]."
312,407,"Oct 11 2008 	Loved our stay at New York New york	We have just stayed here for 10days on the 15th sept 08 and loved every second.There were 4 of us aged between 22 and 28 and there was plenty for all of us to do.Check in was quick and although there is some construction in the main entrance this didn't matter at all.All the staff were polite and helpful.Our rooms were on the 4th floor and were both very clean, maid service was excellent, clean towels every dayThis was our first time in Vegas and to be honest i think this hotel is in one of the better locations along the strip. You have the MGM opposite as well as the Bellagio up the street and a 24hour pharmacy(which to us from England is a 24hour supermarket)next door. The only problem is picking where to eat in the evenings as there are so many to choose from in all the hotels and if you are anything like me and my partner you don't want to feel uncomfortable in a posh restaurant. i would recommend the American Diner near reception in NYNY as they have so many different dishes you can never have the same thing twice.Will be coming back here again on our next Holiday to Vegas!!"
313,407,"Oct 9 2008 	I guess it was just OK	I'll start out by saying were are in the wrong age group to enjoy this hotel. We saw very few other 50 year olds here. I would imagine it would be a fun place to party but our party days are long over.We were offered a free three night stay. The room was to be newly refurbished.........which it certainly was not. The room itself was OK. Very dark and not too special in any way, but OK. They tried to sell us an upgrade, but we didn't care to. The food court is cool, and the food rather tasty. I just didn't find anything I could get excited about. Everything was just...............OK.I need to say the pool area was small and far form OK. It seemed dirty to me.We were spoiled by staying at the treasure island hotel last time. I much prefer the Monte Carlo to New York ."
314,407,"Oct 7 2008	Rooms not comfortable	Ok, you come in and there's construction in the main lobby; makes it difficult to get around. Not a major deal. Line to check in was fast. we upgraded to a spa room. They would not give us the web rate for the upgrade. Our first room was ventilated with smoke from the steakhouse 18 floors below. it was clean, but the tv did not work, the bed was very uncomfortable such that both of us woke up numerous times in the night just to turn over. THERE ARE NO COFFEE MAKERS IN ANY ROOMS. Also, you get charged $14 day for internet access. Apparently the hotel wants you out of your room as much as possible, and in the casino. When I complained, they put us in a wheelchair accessible room. It was ok. The bed was more comfortable, the tv worked. Still no coffee maker. Had I known, I would have brought my own. I did not go to the fancy restaurants or the shows or the nightclub. I looked over the Arcade, and heaven help any adults who have to go there. Much like Chuckie Cheese, you play games for tickets which can be used to buy prizes. The America restaurant was pretty good. Price not bad and food was good. the food court area was about what you would expect - pricey and not that good. The shops were average. We had fun with the digital photo booth which puts your face on other people's bodies -- Marilyn Monroe, show girls and others. The pool was nice, but crowded. We did not make it next door to the topless pool. :)While it is very close to the airport, it is over $20 to get to Freemont street one way. Next time, I will look for a place closer in. With a coffee maker in the room."
315,407,"Oct 7 2008 	Loved it!!!!	We have just got back from a weeks stay at this hotel. We had the best time ever! I went with my partner, we are 25 &amp; 29 and it was a perfect hotel for our age. The entertainment was great. We like a drink so this hotel was the place to be. The rooms were basic but contempory and perfect for what we needed it for.I only have one complaint about this hotel and that is the pool area. For a hotel with 2000 rooms the pool area is very small and because of the where the sun rose the pool did not get sunshine until 12noon and then it was lost again by 4pm. Obviously there is so much to do other than sunbathe but as a sun worshipper myself i would have preffered to be able to sunbathe for longer.Apart from that we had the best time ever!"
316,407,"Oct 7 2008 	You get what you pay for.	I stayed at New York New York Casino for 6 nights when travelling to the USA for business and had an enjoyable stay. Check-in was pretty swift, but we did arrive on Sunday afternoon. I noticed that during peak times (Thurs/Fri) the arrivals line was pretty long.I stayed in rm 2963 in the New Yorker Towers. The room was spacious, with two queen sized beds, a sitting area/desk and the bathroom was also quite spacious. When I arrived the room was clean and tidy. The view from my window was of the Monte Carlo and traffic, but it was a quiet at night. The only negative to this room is that no tea/coffee facilities are provided in the room, you have to purchase this from one of the various cafe's/restaurants in the casino.The casino has a variety of eateries so you will never be without food! The only negative is that smoking is allowed in all casinos, so for a non-smoker it did at times get a little overbearing, particularly when over populated.The location of this hotel is really what you pay for. Conveniently located at the good end of the strip, you are close to MGM, Paris, PH Casino, Bellagio etc. There is a Walgreens a short walk away and the &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; building where you can purchase half price tickets for many of the shows."
317,407,Oct 6 2008 	Not Bad	Spent the night before my wedding day here as well as our wedding night. Room I stayed in for the day before the wedding was not bad. Not a great view but I did get to see the people on the roller coasters funny faces as they flew by.My husband and I got a marquis spa suite (I think that was what it was called) for the night of the wedding.Wasn't that impressed to be honest with you. The whirlpool tub was awesome but the air conditioner didn't even work. We got to our room at about 11:00 p.m. and dropped off some of our things and headed to the casino. We returned at about 3:00 a.m. before we noticed the A/C wasn't working. It was a HOT night and not due to our first night as man and wife either. Room was huge but seemed rather empty and the couch was a rather dingy. Not worth the money my parents forked out to give us a spa suite.I loved the times square area of this hotel was pretty neat and had many different little restaurants to visit.All in all our stay was about a 3.5
318,407,"Oct 6 2008	Average	Our first stay in Vegas, we were expecting razzle-dazzle and a fantastic room. But, you get what you pay for and at $89 per night it wasn't that bad deal in hindsight.There was a problem was with check-in which took 1.5 hours of sitting around in an un-serviced room calling the front desk/housekeeping to figure out.The bed was clean and comfortable and once housekeeping figured out that the room was occupied there was no problem with room-servicing. The room was really dark, and although the view wasn't bad (on to the MGM Grand/Excalibur corner) there was some noise from outside - not as we expected from the roller coaster, but from the Excalibur and (possibly) the ads running on the walkway to the MGM Grand and traffic. It wasn't a huge problem - earplugs help - but this was on the 15th floor and we weren't expecting it!The cafes and bars within the hotel were okay though Gallaghers and Il Fornaio were pricey. Chin-Chin deserves special mention - we ate dinner and breakfast here and were impressed with both. The casino was a disappointment. There was some construction work going on in the middle of it which was boarded off, so it was perhaps smaller than usual, but if you want poker and a little more atmosphere out of your casino, try the MGM Grand over the walkway. We rarely used the casino at NYNY.On the whole it was a fun stay, because Vegas is fun. But we weren't blown away by New York New York and wouldn't rush to stay there again."
319,407,"Oct 4 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	Stayed one night. Booked special rate via email from MGM properties and included upgraded from Park Ave to Century room,breakfast discount and arrival cocktails. The Century tower room was clean, nice furnishings and great view of the strip. Room 3342 was end of hall, but not too far from elevator and had perfect view on Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana Blvd. Elevators were fast as they were exclusive to higher floors. Compares to the Mirage (stayed there about one yr ago) but less expensive."
320,407,"Oct 3 2008 	NY-NY what a wonder town!	This was our first experience at NYNY and we heard a few comments that were less then flattering. So, we arrived saturday about 1PM. Check in was quick, efficient and friendly.We were extremley pleased with our room (which we didn't upgrade). It had new fixtures, nice furniture, very clean and the king size bed and pillows were great!Now the room wasn't real big, but it was just fine for us. The house keeping department was really good. Every morning, our room was prepared earlier and everything was very clean!We ate at several restaurants, Gallighers, American Cafe, Pizza shop (I forget the name), Starbucks and all were quick, friendly and high quality. We hung out at the pool two days and loved it. It did get crowded on Sunday, but on Tuesday it had a moderate crowd. The only issue with the pool was with three drunk fellows, that security quickly removed from the pool! Nice Work! Check out was just as smooth as check in. We even liked the gaming! Needless to say, I give this place 5 stars! We can't wait to go back next year!"
321,407,"Oct 3 2008 	Very average	We stayed here because it was central to most things on the strip and the rooms looked basic on the website which we didn't mind as we presumed we wouldn't be in the room much anyway. The room was clean and sizeable and generally speaking the hotel is ok. The only gripes would be that we had a 30-minute wait to check in and that the pool area no-where nearly accommodated the amount of guests staying at this hotel. Also, when we booked, there was no mention of the works that were going on right in the middle of the ground floor casino. All-in-all this hotel is just very average but cost effective for what you get and well situated."
322,407,"Oct 3 2008 	New York New York is Great Fun	New York New York is great fun. We arrived around five and checked in with no problems. Although we passed check in at three another day and the queue seemed really long. We were offered an upgrade on the day and the room was really good. There was a jacuzzi in the room!! We could hear the roller coaster but this wasn't too bad.The casino itself is nice, far friendlier than a lot of other casinos and the Nine Fine Irishmen is a good spot as is Times Square. Dualling Piano's are hilarious. The pool area is nice, but can get a bit shaded early on and towards the evening - mid afternoon is the best time to go!"
323,407,"Oct 2 2008 	Insulted in Elevator of NYNY Hotel	Stayed at NYNY Hotel because for the price it is a decent hotel. I go to Las Vegas occasionally without my husband to play poker while he goes on business trips back east. Because there is NO poker room at NYNY hotel, I had to cross over the bridge to MGM to play poker. On my way back up to my room around 10:00 p.m. I was solicited for sex in the NYNY elevator. I was quite shocked since I am 51 years old and DO NOT look like a prostitute. I did not know whether to be disgusted or complimented--the idea that anyone would solicit a grandmother of 7 was weird, to say the least. I would never stay there again, just because of this incident."
324,407,"Oct 2 2008 	Loved New York New York	Great atmosphere, friendly staff, many options for eating, good pool, helpful staff. Would recommend and stay again."
325,407,"Oct 2 2008 	average hotel..	stayed in Ny,Ny for 3nights. Booked a park avenue room which was dark,dusty &amp; not really nice! Upgraded to a spa room ($90 extra p/n) and this was much better :)...There was building work in the middle of the casino when i was there but to be honest you would not notice it...Location was ok.....Not bad but would much prefer the venetian or bellagio.."
326,407,"Oct 1 2008 	Smashing	Stayed here for 5 nights in early September. Arrived about 9 at night after a long flight from the UK, and was able to walk straight up to check-in, which was a surprise given it was a Saturday night. Had really good room on 28th floor, near to lift. View was of the car park, but who cares - you don't come to Vegas to spend time (except for sleeping) in your room.Noise in casino could be off-putting, but didn't spend time in there during the day as sightseeing. During the evening, no construction work. Only noise is from &quot;Nine Fine Irishmen&quot;, &quot;Times Square&quot;, and people generally enjoying themselves.Saw Carrott Top at Luxor, and Zumanity at NYNY. Both top shows - well recommended. Nine Fine Irishmen really good too. Live Irish music every night, a bit corny for a mainstream Brit, but still enjoyable.Would it recommend it yes. Would I stay here again - most definitely. Already saving my pennies for next year. One tip, bring plenty of money, and leave anybody under 21 at home. This is an adults playground."
327,407,"Sep 30 2008 	Enjoyed our stay at the NYNY	Stayed here from 9/24 -/9/29. This was the fourth hotel we stayed it during a 12 day Las Vegas/LA/Las Vegas trip and we were not disappointed. We received an email offer and got a super rate of $49/night for weekday and $79/weekend which is unheard of for a Strip hotel.Check in on 9/24 was a breeze and we received the exact king non smoking room we requested. We stayed on the 27th floor of the Century tower. The noise of the roller coaster was not really an issue since we were well above it, but I could see where it might be loud if you had a lower floor. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. One thing we really noticed about the NYNY that is different from all other LV hotels was how quiet the room is. The hallways are not a straight linelike in most hotels. There are twists and turns that follow the unique shape of the building and this tends to makes sounds in the hallway not travel so far. Also, I noticed that the doors to the rooms don't slam like in other hotels which was nice.We visited the pool a couple of times and it was ok, but nothing spectacular. We don't like sitting in the sun, so were actually happy that the pool is shaded for a lot of the time. Call us crazy. I could see where the pool would get very crowded at other times of the year though. There is not a lot of room for chairs and it does look like it would be cramped.We like the location of the NYNY on the Strip because it is easy to walk over the bridges to MGM, Excalibur or Tropicana.There is still work being done in the casino. They have torn out the old replica Cnetral Park that used to be in the center of the casino floor and are still working on it. We didn't really care too much about this since we don't tend to stay in any one casino very long anyway.Checkout was a breeze and without incident. Overall, I would stay at the NYNY again, especially if we received such a great room deal."
328,407,"Sep 29 2008 	Super	We went there for 3 nights.Rooms were big and comfortable. Very clean...Beds matras was soft.Only internet was payable, disappointing for this kind of hotel.Casino was fun and the new nightclub ROK was fun, fun fun!!!Breakfast was not what we expected. No buffet service what we were told."
329,407,"Sep 29 2008 	Great Stay	Stayed at the hotel for 4 nights from 11 September. We arrived to find our room was not ready but were told to return at 3.00 when it would be. When we returned at the designated time the room was ready. Had a Broadway Deluxe room overlooking the MGM on 12th floor. Had no problem with any noise from outside or other guests. The room was spacious, clean with enough storage space and a huge tv - which we did not use as there were better things to do. Only had breakfast in the hotel - Il Fornio where the coffee and toasted sandwiches were fantastic. The hotel does not have a large shopping malls as others further along the strip have but this to me was an advantage as it reduced the number of people visiting the hotel. The customer services guy we spoke to was always willing to help us plan our days with advice on the best way to get to off strip locations. One tip if you are into Pinball then you must visit the Pinball Museum where you will find lots of different machines of different ages which you can still play! Did not play the tables here as for an amateur the minimum bet on the table was too high but would recommend the TI where the mins are lower. Also as there was no queue at check in in the evening I would recommend settling your account the night before you leave to avoid the queues in the morining. For a reasonable hotel in a great location this is the place to stay"
330,407,"Sep 28 2008 	Great Hotel	It has taken me awhile to write this review but here it is. To start with, the short cab ride to the hotel was quick and easy. There was a lengthy line at 1 PM on saturday to check in but after 20 minutes our room was ready early. Perfect. The rooms were your average hotel room. Nothing special, but clean, quiet and comfortable. Our room looked out over the pool and you could see the mountains in the distance, which was a decent view. The beds were comfortable and our rooms were made up perfect everyday, and believe me we made a mess day in and day out. We were on the 12 floor and the elevators were very quick and almost always available. The casino was great some construction but the atmosphere was lively. Typical strip minimums on the tables and tight slots, at least i thought but still had a great time. Location is the south end of the strip and right across from MGM Grand and a short walk to excalibur and from there you can take the free train to luxor and mandelay bay. Hotel amenities are great and gallaghers steak house was amazing. I had the prime rib and it very good. The food court also had good choices as did nine fine irishmen. Entertainment was great i liked the piano bar and ESPN Zone. All in all it was a great hotel and a great trip. For the reasonable price i would say you get your moneys worth."
331,407,"Sep 27 2008 	new york new year	We stayed here for New Year after several other visits to New York, Room was comparable to other places we had paid less for at other times of year. I think other places have better lower bet tables early in the evening without such high mins, particularly TI if you are on he strip. Las Vegas though just you don't love it ! We went to the palms on NYE would thoroughly recommend it both drinks package, view and experience."
332,407,"Sep 25 2008 	Would Stay Again	Even though its almost been a year since I've been there. I have to say I really enjoyed New York-New York. I still talk about it today. I would love to go again. Everyone was so nice and willing to go out of their way to help us. The only down of the hotel was we all wanted our rooms together, but our room was at the VERY end of the hall way and our other friends were on a flower below us at the other end of the hallway..not together. But still had a great time!"
333,407,"Sep 24 2008 	good for the price!	We stayed for 6 days, 5 nights in September and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. While it's not a luxury hotel like the Bellagio or Caesar's, it's definitely a good deal! The location is great, right across from the MGM Grand and it's facade is beautiful, with a replica of the Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty and the New York City skyline. The roller coaster was fun although a bit of a rocky ride. We booked through vegas.com and got upgraded to a nicer room with a bunch of coupons (e.g. 2 for 1 breakfast at Il Fornaio, 2 for 1 roller coaster rides, 2 free cocktails, etc.). The rooms were clean and fairly spacious, with a beautiful marble bathroom, comfortable beds and plenty of down pillows. The only complaint about the room was that there was no fan in the bathroom, so the mirror always fogged up after a shower. We were also missing basic amenities (shampoo, soap, etc.) when we checked in, but a quick call to housekeeping solved the problem, and it never happened again during our stay. We also got fresh towels every day, even though we didn't request it. Although I appreciated this touch, I was slightly bothered by the fact that my attempt to be environmental was ignored by the staff; perhaps the daily tip made him/her want to go the extra mile?The casino was small in comparison to some of the other hotels and there was still a lot of construction noise as they were finishing up Rok nightclub at the start of our visit, but that quickly cleared up halfway through our trip. The restaurants were interesting enough although the pizza place was very disorganized (it took 40 minutes for us to get a pizza), but the Chinese breakfast buffet was good value for the cost. There was a great margarita bar upstairs with plenty of different flavours to choose from but the shopping was very limited, as was expected from a relatively small-scale hotel like NYNY.It's connected to the MGM via walkway, so it's location is quite convenient, as you can catch the Monorail from the MGM to take you to most points of interest along the strip. Since we booked our trip with airfare plus hotel, it's hard to say how much the hotel itself cost, but it felt like a pretty good deal, in comparison to some other hotels we were looking at. Especially given it's location, it's definitely a good deal, as you can pay less to stay there but still be nearby to the other big name hotels. We would definitely stay there again!"
334,407,"Sep 24 2008 	Great time. Worth a visit.	This was our first trip to Vegas and had high hopes. We weren't disappointed.NYNY is pretty spectacular, especially from the outside. Its a replica of NY City, with skyscrapers, a mini Brooklyn Bridge and their very own Statue of Liberty.Inside is a large casino and a food court replicating the streets of NY City. There's plenty to eat if you like fast food (i.e. pizzas, bagels, burgers etc). The food was very good, especially the pastrami bagels from the deli.There are some restaurants in the hotel. We tried the Italian (nothing special) and Gallagher's steak house. Be warned, the steaks here are HUGE!!!! There were six of us. None of us were able to eat a whole rib-eye ($35 each). Do the sensible thing, share one.We visted other hotels on the strip - Venitian, Paris, Mirage, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay - and discovered that their malls, casinos and food courts were bigger and, probably, better. But there was something very comforting and relaxing about NYNY. The room we had (Park Avenue) was bigger than we expected and very clean. It had everything we needed.NYNY is at the south end of the strip. Its quite a walk to the hotels and sights further up the strip, especially in the 100 degree heat we experienced. If you need to travel north, we recommend using the Deuce, the 24-hour bus service that runs the length of the strip. Its only $5 for a 24-hour unlimited pass.Sights to take in when you're in Vegas - the Grand Canyon (a must), the Bellagio fountains, the baby lions and dolphin at the Mirage, the light shown at Fremont Street (Downtown).All in all, you'll hopefully find NYNY a great place to stay."
1,415,Nov 12 2009 	Loved It	Stayed at Polo towers 1 week. Got strip view on 16th floor which had a balcony. Loved the view and enjoyed the closeness to the strip. A &quot;tix for tonight&quot; booth is right in front on the strip which made getting discount show tickets a breeze. The house keeping cleaned our room everyday which is hard to find in a time share. For light sleepers you can hear Karaoke on the street till 3 am so be warned. Polo towers has one of the best locations on the strip and our stay was great.
2,415,"Oct 25 2009 	Location location location	We had a Studio at the Polo Towers, the room is small but well appointed, it has everything you need. I was affraid of the Murphy bed but the bed was very comfortable. Rooms are very clean. We had fresh towels every single day of our stay. The location of this hotel is great, you can walk to MGM, Planet Hollywood, NY NY etc.,I have been reading bad reviews about this hotel and I can only say one thing, if you are looking for luxury you need to stay at the Bellagio, Encore, Wynn, pay the price and don't complaint. This is a very comfortable and clean hotel.I will stay at the Polo Towes again."
3,415,"Oct 24 2009 	Just average...really really average	First of all, we had a lock off room with a kitchenette and that's never a good idea. Second, we own at the Marriott Grand Chateau next door which is WORLD's better, but wasn't quite finished when we made this trip and our week was a free comp from Marriott for our timeshare purchase. The room was very average and small, but that's because it was the lock off room. It is in a good location, just right off the strip and we only rarely drove or used a cab to get to anything. Service was average at best. Whenever we asked for something it took a while and often, multiple calls, to get what we wanted or needed. You need to know that with most timeshares, check out is 10am and since we didn't get in until 4am the morning we were supposed to check out, we negotiated an additional 2 or 3 hours for an extra $45. We needed the sleep and check out at noon or 1pm was a much better idea. Alas, the front desk called at 9am to verify that we were going to be checking out late. And woke us up. And yes, I was not very pleasant. Then, just as we drifted back off...housekeeping started cleaning the connected room very loudly and then knocked on our door repeatedly and then tried to get in. By the time I pulled the door open, the cleaning lady was running down the hallway, because she realized she'd made a mistake. Not her fault. She wasn't told not to clean our room, but should've been told. I wanted to argue about the $45, but my wife wisely suggested I go get the car and find my peace and she checked us out. Better to write off the money and enjoy the rest of the day. So...my experience was sub-par, but I'd say overall the Polo Towers is a very average hotel and I feel for anyone who buys here with something as nice as the Grand Chateau next door. Oh, and even if you don't stay here (which you shouldn't), check out the three horse sculpture in the lobby. There's something really wrong about it and I think all three horses that posed for the sculpture are going to need some counseling. I'm just saying, it looks...well, it looks wrong. That's all."
4,415,Oct 9 2009 	Perfect Las Vegas Location	This condo style hotel was absolutely perfect. It is located in the heart of the strip. Will stay there on our next visit.
