57,157,"Oct 12 2007 	Great Value and Location!	This hotel needs some adjustments but the location was awesome (1 block away from the blue line station and to get to HOOTERS you just need to pass hotel's parking lot :) The room was clean and quite big. Breakfast was OK - standard continetal breakfast (cereal, jelly, cream cheese, bread, muffins etc...) There were two things that I didn't like - the Internet wasn't free and there was no fan in the bathroom. Other than that it wah clean, the staff was nice and helpful and we didn't have to wait for the shuttle more than 20 minutes. Good Value for cheap price. If I visit Chiago again I'll stay there for sure."
58,157,"Oct 11 2007 	Good hotel for the price	I booked and paid for this hotel before I read the reviews. I have to admit, I was expecting the worse and was very pleasantly surprised with the hotel. Granted it is a bit worn down but at $100 per night, I was not expecting the Ritz Carleton. I was in town with my daughter to watch a family member run the Chicago marathon. Other family members stayed down on Michigan Ave where hotels were gouging their patrons. This hotel was very close to a train stop and the hotel shuttle dropped us off and picked us up with no problem. The staff at the hotel were all pleasant. Upon leaving the hotel, I realized that I had left my briefcase. Within minutes of calling the hotel, the briefcase was found, boxed up and sent next day air. Given the price and convenience, I would stay at this hotel again."
59,157,"Aug 28 2007 	Disgusting	Worst hotel stay ever. Dirty and run down. Halls had holes in the walls (they called it remodeling - appeared to be general disrepair). Room we booked was &quot;not available&quot;. The room we were given had two beds - both unmade and slept in. The second room was dirty, run down and the mattress had a sunken hole in the center. Front desk staff was indifferent. Phone number we were given to call for airport pick up was printed incorrectly on the card and there was no answer. Shuttle that was to run every 30 mins came once in 1.5 hours. Shuttle door did not work and we had to climb over front seats and passengers to sit in the back. Even if the price is right, would highly recommend staying somewhere else."
60,157,Aug 22 2007 	Great location and staff	We choose this hotel because they said it was close to the train. We were taking our family to the cubs game. When we arrived the staff was extremly helpful and friendly. They answered all our questions. The train is so close to go to downtown. My wife was surprised to see how clean the hotel was. We would diffenetly return
61,157,"Aug 22 2007 	Great Hotel Location 	I Got a Great rate through Expedia which was Only the beginning. This Hotel is at a Great Locatioon, So close to O'Hare Airport &amp; just seconds from the train station b/c I had to go downtown everyday. The Free breakfast buffet is Great &amp; the Internet was Free &amp; fast. Definitely coming back here Again &amp; Again. i recommend it to All."
62,157,"Apr 16 2007 	It's a toss up to stay here	My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights to see the Quilt show. It was convenient to the convention center and the CTA trains, assuming you could get the hotel to get you there and back. We took the shuttle 5 times and 2 of them were horrible. We waited for almost 50 minutes for a pickup at 10:30 PM from the airport upon arriving on a flight and another 50 minutes when we got back from down town, despite calling when we were still on the train 15 minutes from the station. The other 3 attempts all went off without a hitch.Our room, unlike some other members reported, was clean, right near the front desk and was apparently one of the ones re-done. Bed was comfortable, but shower was not designed well, so leaked water on the floor. Maybe we sleep harder than others, but our room was right by the parking lot and we didn't hear any outside noise. (maybe this was part of re-doing the room?)Buffet was also very so-so. Food not hot, barely warm. Only scrambled eggs, eggs with peppers and onions, bacon, sausage and soggy french toast. They had some cold cereals available, pastries, bagels, and coffee and tea. We each got 1 free buffet after complaining about the long waits for the shuttle. I can't say people at the hotel didn't care, but there was some OBVIOUS lack of communications between the number you call and the drivers.For outside food, there is a Hooters right next door as well as a fabulous Thai restaurant 2 short blocks from the hotel. We ate there the second night and it made the shuttle problems melt away."
63,157,"Apr 15 2007 	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!RUN LIKE SPEEDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	The front desk help was excellent! The service they offered us was quite impeccable. However, I requested a smoking room yet to receive a non-smoking room. the air conditioner did not work, the bathrrom was dirty and there were only two towels in the bathroom. Furthermore, there urine stains on the toilet and the floor was covered with hair.The room was way too small for the price we paid. We demanded a transfer to a cleaner, larger room. And upgrade to what? This is an understatement. From what? A motel 6? The location The location is accessible to the freeway but due to construction work you will have to travel atleast 1 hur just ot make it through the nightmare of getting to the downtown area.I do not recomend my mother-in-law to stay here! Be like Speedy Gonzalez, yelling at the top of your lungs and run like hell!"
64,157,"Apr 14 2007 	This is Not A Wyndham Hotel Stop Selling this as a Wyndham	I just went to the hotel las Saturday to get a room. The show me room 147, the boxspring had wires sticking out no cover what so ever the carpet was so dirty the hotel it's just nasty. The hallways are filthy and who ever did the &quot;renovation&quot; on those stair need to be fired. After seen the fiith in this property I did not take the room. After that I call Wyndham and the hotel does not show up on the computer they got kick out by wyndham But they still deceiving the customers by telling them they are a Wyndham property. Please Do not SELL THIS HOTEL AS A WYNDHAM they have no name...."
65,157,"Mar 16 2007 	Stay Elsewhere	I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip. Outside of a meager buffet breakfast, the food I had in the dining room was overpriced and poor. The &quot;renovation&quot; other reviewers have talked about for months has made little progress. The printer for the public computer was out of order. The room was so close to I-90 and the train that it was very hard to sleep at all. To top it off, in the middle of one night the hotel staff were trying to break down the door of the next room for a guest because their key did not let them back in. The clerk at the desk just laughed when contacted."
66,157,"Feb 8 2007 	Cold rooms cold water	I was staying at the hotel for three nights and actually cut my trip short to two nights. The rooms did have nice beds but, thats about all.My room was very cold and the heat would not work. I turned the heat on at 5am and waited until 7am and my room was still cold. I called the front desk and they said they would have some one come up to the room. No one came to the room and i had to leave for a show.I got baack six hours later the room was still cold so I called back down to the front desk and was told that &quot;the building is old and when it gets cold and windy the top floor is hard to heat&quot;. I then asked for the desk manager who told me some one would be up, never happend.Not only was the room cold but the water for the bath was cold as well. I could not get hot water for the shower or the bath so, I had to heat up water with my in room coffe pot!"

1,172,"Great Time Beautiful Location	My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon. We wanted a comfortable luxury hotel that was close to the Mag. Mile. We were able to get a Corner King on the 21st floor. It was a great view. The pluses-Amazing bed-The shower was very lavish-Hotel staff were very helpful-Breakfast (free if you make your reservations online) was delicious and very filling-Location (near Mag Mile with a Whole Foods around the corner for easy snacks)-MP3 docking station was a nice add on-The gym was sufficient for a quick workout-The Spa was helpful and my massage felt wonderful after alot of walking around Chicago and my wife enjoyed her manicure and facial. Minuses -The second floor entrance was a slight problem but nothing that you can't handle-The ceilings were much to look at-The Spa prices were higher than we were used to but seemed to be inline with downtown Chicago. So as you can see I don't have alot of negative things to say about Dana. The service was great, the view was wonderful and the amenities were lavish. I would recommend this hotel to young couples or hip familes visiting Chicago for leisure"
2,172,Very Nice	The Dana was an excellent hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. Ultra modern styling with a personalized and friendly staff.
3,172,"Nov 22 2009 	Great deal	We booked through travelocity and paid $130 a night including breakfast. The rooms are small and modern. Bed very comfortable. Close to everything. Bar on top floor, restaurant in lobby, both good. Staff very friendly."
4,172,"Oct 20 2009 	Perfect place to relax in the middle of the city!	We were in Chicago for the marathon so wanted a hotel that we could have a comfortable sleep at the night before the race, and then a nice central place to enjoy after the marathon for a few days of sightseeing in the wonderful city of Chicago...the Dana fit the bill. Service was outstanding from the moment we arrived..the front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. The room (cozy king) was TINY- but...we expected that for the rate we paid. It had everything we needed. Was worried about not having a tub to soak my weary muscles after the run- but the water pressure in the shower was amazing! Really decent prices in the minibar....which never makes sense to me when a hotel quadruples the regular price for a bottle of water or beer. I'll just get it elsewhere! Breakfast was excellent. Very busy on the Monday morning of Columbus Day...but fine after that. Only downside was that the rooms could have better soundproofing- or any for that matter. I sleep through anything so no problem- but my husband was up half one night due to a party next door. Security did come up- but it started up again. Overall- highly recommend the Dana. Location is amazing- bars/food all around you- Whole foods/Trader Joe's both within blocks (treat for us- no TJ's in Canada) for snacks/liquor, right between 2 subway stops on red line- walking (or hobbling if you ran a marathon) distance to most of the sights....a great stay-thanks Dana!"
5,172,"Oct 20 2009 	Fantastic Experience and First Class Staff	After checking Trip Advisor and seeing the pictures of the Dana Hotel, we booked a room knowing it would be close to the Magnificent Mile and friends who were also visting Chicago. You could not have asked for a better experience! The rate was great and it included a wonderful breakfast. The location was ideal to everything we wanted to do. The spacious and hip room was on the 18th floor with a terrific view. The see-through shower into the bedroom and for all the world to see was a cool addition and a good talker with our friends who visited us. (We amde sure to take pictures but they can't be posted here.) The bed and plllows were extremely comfortable and simply the best we've ever had in a hotel. The room was also very quiet which provided for a great night's sleep.We went up to the Vertigo Bar and Club on the top floor and that was fun. It's one of the hottest night spots in town. The entire hotel is very contemporary and very pleasing to the eye. Very well designed and it added to our whole experience in Chicago. And that brings us to the staff. They couldn't have been more helpful. Jeff, Romeo and Lindsey offered us some of the best suggestions on places to eat and visit. Our first night, we wanted romance and Jeff made reservations for us at nearby &quot;Devon.&quot; We arrived to a posh restaurant and were given a private room overlooking the rest of the restaurant and tables. The food and service was incredible and it didn't take a huge chuck out of my wallet. All the other helpful suggestions from the Dana staff were right on. On our last night we wanted to hear some jazz.. Jeff recommended the Green Mill, an old nightclub that Al Capone used to frequent. To my surprise, one of my favorite jazz artists was performing that night. We went to see Patricia Barber and had the table right in front of her piano. Talk about an incredible last night in Chicago. There are many hotels in Chicago to choose from and experience. But our time at the Dana was so much fun, when we go back to Chicago, we're staying there again. Highly recommended."
6,172,"Oct 16 2009 	Great hotel Excellent location 	We stayed at the Dana in Sept, on our way home to NZ after 5 weeks of travelling around Canada. It was the perfect place to unwind for 3 days. Very helpful staff, lots of good restaurants nearby and within walking distance of the magnificent mile.We were on the 19th floor with a balcony with great views over the city. The room was a good size with a fantastic shower, and very clean. Even the ongoing noise from the police, fire engines and ambulances drifting up from the street was'nt too bad.Also very impressed with Quartino, a Italian restaurant, one block away, recommended by the concierge. She also gave us some discount coupons to use there. Very good food.The breakfast downstains was also very good."
7,172,"Oct 15 2009 	Nice Rooms Great Views...and Good Food - comes slowley	The hotel is centrally located. That's been said. And yes, there is some street noise, although I didn't get much hallway noise. But I haven't been to a hotel yet, in a big city, that didn't have some noise. That said; check-in was efficient and easy. The bags were taken to our room while we went into the bar to pay for a very overpriced drink. I mean, we ordered an Irish coffee and got charged $5.00 for the cup of coffee and then $6.00 for the shot...anyway...it is a hotel bar. Up to the room, nicely appointed. The bathroom is large with a beautiful shower (we were in a double queen room - our shower had only one head, our friends were in a Comfort King room - they had like water coming from every direction) - nice comfy robes to wear too. The hair-dryer was feeble...but eventually did the job. The biggest problem with the hotel is the inconsistency. The first night the maid turned down the beds and pulled the shades, but neglected to pull the blackout shades; an important feature when you are in an east facing room...and we didn't know to do it ourselves. The second night, they were pulled, but the maid threw the pillows on the chair next to them so there was a nice crack for that sun to peek through, right into my friends eyes. A nice touch is that they give you coupons for a made to order breakfast in their downstairs restaurant - valued at $15.00. So in the morning we went downstairs for breakfast...it was busy...we waited...once we sat...we waited...and waited...can someone PLEASE bring us some coffee???? Oh, sure...we waited...and waited...can we say, the service was slow? Yes, yes we can. The food was mostly good; again a couple of missteps and inconstancies; I assume the kitchen makes their poached eggs in advance, using the method of putting the egg into an ice bath to hold it until service and then putting it into hot water to warm and finish cooking; it's an important step, that putting it back into hot water; when it's not done, the egg is a cold as ice. As was the eggs on my friend's Eggs Benedict. However, the poached eggs on my other friends plate were hot. The second morning was no better than the first on service...it was slow, and worse, it's like they are ignoring you. They don't even make eye contact. That morning I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy...let me say this...clearly...DON'T...it's not Biscuits and Gravy, it's a biscuit in some white stuff with some slices of sausage and mushrooms...that's just not right. I do want to give a shout out to TJ and the guy with the Tats, (sorry can't remember your name) you guys were great!LindySez: It's a nice place to stay, central to many sites, comfortable, and the food is good...just don't expect it any time soon."
8,172,"Oct 15 2009 	Home away from home - fantastic!	I was in Chicago to run the marathon and needed a place that offered a peaceful, relaxing room to help calm my marathon nerves and the Dana was perfect. I had a corner room with two walls of floor to ceiling windows and often times I would get lost just looking out into the city. Other times, I melted into the oh-so-comfy bed and let the stress flow away from me. The modern, urban decor of the hotel actally allowed me to forget I was in hotel and it was more like a home away from home. I'm not such a great writer so all the postiive things other reviewers have said....I'll just ditto those comments. The staff was great. My check-in took all of 90 seconds. My check-out less. The concierge was quick with restaurant suggestions that were perfect. The hotel was even kind enough to have coffee, bottled water, bananas, bagels, etc. for guest marathoners on race morning. What a nice, unexpected, very thoughtful treat. Suffice to say, I'll be back at the Dana anytime I return to Chicago - and that's as often as I can. Great city. Fantastic hotel. Couldn't have asked for better."
9,172,"Oct 12 2009 	The Dana experience was worth it!!	My wife and I came into Chicago on a late Thursday evening for the Chicago marathon. The staff was very friendly and helpful in getting us settled. The location of the hotel in Chicago left us only several blocks off Michigan Ave. and the shopping district which we truly enjoyed. The front desk staff. waiters, and doormen were very cordial and helpful with any of our questions. The room was clean, and comfortable. It was nice to come in from a day out in Chicago to a turned down bed and a quiet room. This hotels location to the Navy Pier, the lake shore park, numerous restaurants, and shopping made our visit a great one."
10,172,"Oct 12 2009 	Perfect -- they did everything right	Attended a small conference at the hotel and stayed there for three nights (extended for long weekend of sightseeing after the conference). My colleague and I were in total agreement that this was a stellar hotel experience -- on the flight home we tried as hard as we could to find something to criticize and couldn't come up with a single thing! The modern design of the building was wonderful (new construction) and the interior design very contemporary but classy -- just the style we both like. My room was a huge suite with great decor, a huge bathroom with gigantic walk-in double shower and two balconies. The make or break with any hotel room really is the bed and this one was fantastically comfortable with beautiful fine linens. You know, so many hotels have a trendy design aesthetic and decent beds, but what really made this experience supreme was the staff -- they were all young but on their game. Everyone from the clerks at check-in to the room service attendee, to the waiters in the restaurant, to the concierge, to the doormen, to the manicurist, they all just had that special something: a friendly quiet confidence in their manner that made you feel comfortable and taken care of. Bravo to them and the manager who knows how to hire for keepers. Bravo to all! I would stay here again without a moment of hesitation."
11,172,"Oct 11 2009 	Argh elevators of doom!	Pros:Great location - very central.Our corner room had 2 walls of floor to ceiling windows and an unpainted concrete ceiling. We really loved the modern decor and it felt very spacious, but maybe that was because of the corner location.We were very happy with the amenities in the room - fantastically comfortable bed, wonderful (huge) shower, coffee maker, safe.The inclusion of a Zeppelin mp3 player is impressive, even if we didn't use it. Our deal included $15 breakfast vouchers. We enjoyed the breakfasts, but without those vouchers, we probably would have taken breakfast elsewhere, as it's a bit pricey.The check-in machines located in the lobby enabled us to print out our boarding passes for the flight home. Awesome. Very impressed with these!Cons:The elevators. I know this sounds ridiculous, but they are the single worst thing about this hotel. The elevators shot past our floor on a regular basis, as we weren't fast enough on the trigger with our key cards. What's the point of every guest having to insert their card to select their floor when, if they were really intent on causing mayhem on a floor where they don't belong, they could just walk up or down the stair shaft to another floor anyway?! Hotel management seriously need to ditch the card system - it's infuriating. We met a disabled guest with a walking aid, riding up and down the elevator for ages, trying in vain to reach his floor. Finding a way to enter the rooftop bar was rather a quest, as you cannot go there directly from the guest elevators. You have to go via security, even to be allowed in to the special elevator up to the bar. In any other hotel with a rooftop bar, I'd have been up there several times, maybe even in the daytime, checking out the view. Not a chance with this one. When we did finally make it up there, all the areas near the windows were sectioned off for private parties anyway. It felt like they're actively trying to discourage guests from drinking in the rooftop bar.There was no information in the room re. the location of the spa. All of this creates a general feeling of &quot;We're too cool to tell you where anything is&quot;, which is a bit tiresome."
12,172,"Oct 11 2009 	There is no better than the Dana Hotel	My partner and I had the pleasure of staying at the Dana Hotel and Spa for five nights from October 1st to October 6th. It is quite possibly the best hotel stay I have ever had in the entire world (and we have traveled extensively). The check in could not have gone easier. We were even allowed to check in a bit early... which is a no-no at many hotels. The room itself is absolutey gorgeous. We stayed in a king room. Most rooms face State Street except for the ones with a balcony. The room is absolutely gorgeous! The floors were beautiful. The bed was extremely comfortable. We absolutely loved the decor. We actually liked the exposed unfinished concrete ceilings. The bathroom is a work of art in itself. The mirror's border lit up from the inside. The shower's glass wall faced the room (of course there was a curtain). The rain showerhead in the bathroom was a beautiful touch. The mini-bar's prices were reasonable. We absolutely loved the iPod docking station and the free WI-FI and ethernet connection in the room. I liked the extra touch of turn down service in the evening. Overall, the Dana is a hotel that I am looking forward to visiting again when we return to Chicago. I would also like to send a special &quot;thank you&quot; to Tim Anderson, the concierge manager who delivered a bottle of champagne to my room because he knew that I was there celebrating my 40th birthday."
13,172,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Hotel	My husband and I traveled to Chicago for the first time. There are so many hotels to choose from, so I didnt know where to begin. I looked at the W Hotel, but the rates were very high. I saw the Dana Hotel and decided to give it a try. I was very pleased with this hotel. It is very trendy and modern. The location is very good--short walking distance to Michigan Avenue. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I think this is a great hotel. The rates seemed to be very reasonable for a hotel in Chicago in a great location. We will definitely stay here again."
14,172,"Oct 8 2009	Had a great weekend there with my sister!	LOVE the setup of the room. The shower is pretty cool as well. The ipod doc with speakers was AMAZING! And the TV, and bed were FABULOUS!The crappy thing is that they didn't have a pool/ hot tub and the club upstairs ONLY played Alternative music- NO pop or hip-hop and R&amp;B- which really sucked :(Anywho, it was a fun labor day weekend with my sister :) Hotel staff was REALLY NICE!Parking was expensive- the lot across the street was cheaper but still expensive at 29.00 per night."
15,172,"Oct 8 2009 	Trendy comfortable hotel with good food and rooftop bar.	I stayed here for my brother's wedding weekend in August and was very pleased with the accomodations. The price was great for the Loop and the room was really nice - very comfortable beds and great shower. Note: the shower is visible from the bedroom, though there is a curtain to block the view. Just kind of weird. The restaurant had good food, though the service was really slow. And the rooftop bar had friendly staff and a great band. Would definitely stay here again!"
16,172,"Oct 4 2009 	My new favorite hotel in Chicago	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Dana for 3 nights in late September. From the moment we got there, the service was fantastic. Doormen were welcoming and friendly, and Tim the concierge manager was amazing. We had a Corner King room and even though it wasn't huge, it was extremely comfortable and stylish. Breakfast was included in our room rate and instead of the usual, lame continental breakfast, it was a $15pp credit at the restaurant. Needless to say, each day started off with a fantastic breakfast. The rooftop lounge was pretty cool, not too busy when we were there and ideal for late afternoon drinks. We just loved this hotel because of location, service and everything else. This was my fourth time in Chicago, each time at a different hotel, and this was definitely my favorite. Will be staying there from now on."
17,172,"Oct 1 2009 	Loved the Dana!	I stayed for 3 nights at the Dana with my friend and we absolutely loved it.Location - Close to the subway/transit but easy enough to walk pretty much anywhere if you have the time and energy to do it. We purchased 72 hour transit passes for $14 and they were well worth it.Rooms - We had a Comfy King, so it was a bit small, but this did not in any way negatively impact our stay. We had a small balcony overlooking State Street , which was great and the entire balcony consisted of huge windows. The decor was ultra-modern, which is very much our style. If you don't like modern you won't like this room. The room had a large flat screen TV, a great sound system and a single serve coffee maker which made great coffee. There was a well stocked honour bar which I thought was quite reasonably priced. Bedding and linens were top-notch. The glass walled shower (which can be visible to the sleeping area if you want - we always had the curtain drawn) and vanity area were beautiful. Turn down service was provided and on 2 of the three nights, chocolate covered fortune cookies were left on the bed. Thick robes and slippers are provided for your use. Staff - Staff were wonderful - particularly the doormen who were always ready to help out. When you check in your luggage is taken and delivered to your room as the actual check in desk is on the second floor. The bellman offered some great tips on Chicago . All the staff were extremely helpful and courteous.Dining - We only ate breakfast at the hotel. $15 vouchers are provided for each morning of your stay, for each person. I found the prices to be very reasonable and between the 2 of us, we never exceeded the $30. Free coffee was available at the lobby bar so that helped lessen the breakfast bill. I usually had a coffee (or 2) in my room as soon as I woke up. As one other poster mentioned, the pancakes are too large, but they made for a great picture. I had the grilled PB&amp;J, which was very nice, and a fresh fruit smoothie and toast. I always found it to be more than enough food. My friend usually had some type of egg dish and was always happy with her meal.Facilities - We didn't use the spa, but checked out the gym. It is on the small side, but had several cardio machines and free weights.I would definitely stay here again. And I also noticed there were several young families staying at the hotel. I also wouldn't hesitate to bring the rest of my family here. I found the best price booking directly with the hotel."
18,172,"Sep 30 2009 	Awesome Place!!	I came to Chicago for a girls weekend, and was pleasantly surprised by the Dana. From the moment we walked up to the hotel all of the staff was more than helpfull! The rooms are kinda of small but the atmosphere more than makes up for it. If you have any problems finding your way around Chicago, or just want an opinion on where to eat, ask TJ he is one of the doorman there. He may have been the friendliest and most helpful one of them all. I will not stay at another hotel in Chicago from now on!!! The beds were AMAZING!"
19,172,"Sep 26 2009 	Hotel staff amazing 	It was our 20th anniversary treat and first visit to Chicago. I phoned for direct reservation and Laura made sure we were treated well from the start. We had a great rate due to a promotion. The staff all knew us by name and were most attentive, from the doormen to the front desk and particularly the concierge - Tim! He went the extra mile in whatever queries we had. Tiffany and Romeo were also top notch! I agree with the already mentioned positive comments of other reviewers.The only dispute I have with one of the reviews is that their restaurant's breakfast portions were NOT too large at all. Sadly the service could be vastly improved, the waitresses over the four days were consistently inattentive and forgetful with our requests. Such a contrast from the amazing hotel staff. That would be my only negative comment. Inspite of that, I would definitely make Dana my preferred hotel to return to. Definitely a young crowd but vitality is infectious! Even old married couples are welcomed!"
20,172,"Sep 24 2009 	Fantastic Location	The Dana Hotel is a very trendy, well located hotel. Located only a few blocks away from the mag mile and only 2 blocks from the train!The front entrance is very plain and you need to take an elevator up to the very small lobby. The staff was fantastic! They were very polite and very accomodating. The doormen were awesome and very friendly!There were a few issues - when we booked our hotel it said it included a free continental breakfast. The first morning we asked about breakfast and were directed to the Aja restaurant. We were given a regular menu and paid for our breakfast. The next morning we asked again about the continental breakfast and were told that they had &quot;discontinued&quot; the continental breakfast but should have been given vouchers at the front desk for those who had booked with the free breakfast option. She gave us a voucher for breakfast that morning and compted us for the breakfast we had paid for the day before. All in all, huge points for excellent customer service.The breakfast at the hotel was okay. I found it quite heavy and greasy- and don't order the pancakes - they are the size of the table - as we noticed some other hotel guests had ordered and could barely eat half of it.The rooms were small but well appointed. there were robes and slippers - nice touch. And they have a real hairdryer that is not attached to the wall - huge bonus! Our room did not have a window but rather a small balcony. Cute. The noise from the hallway can be heard into the bedroom so we ended up stuffing a towel under the door every night.The Vertigo Lounge on the rooftop was nice. Busy on the Saturday night -had some pretty nice views of the city.Overall, it was a great experience!"
21,172,"Sep 24 2009 	Welcome back	I've stayed at this hotel approximately 4 times for a combination of business and personal and had a very positive experience from my very first stay which is why I chose to return whenever I am in Chicago. I am a diamond member at Hyatt and equivalent levels at other chain hotels. I travel approximately 2-3 months a year on business. I used to stay at the Hyatt Regency exclusively whenever in town but their treatment of frequent guests is spotty at best. Reason I bring this up is that the Dana treats me better than the other guys and they do take care of their returning guests. Ijust wish more of my business travels brings me back to my home city.Yes, my home city! For those of you who like sweeping city views and want an experience of city living at least for a short while, this is the place for you. I just happen to like a balcony over looking the bustling city streets and people watch while having a glass of wine to think about the day's events but that's just my preference. The technology in the room is great and the location is perfect just off of Mag Mile, tucked away amongst the many high rise condos which adds visual interest.The rooms are definitely interesting but if you like the plain and mundane and like the roudy convention crowds of large chain hotels, this is not the place for you. I can't comment on the restaurant or in room dining because I've never dined in the hotel (I hit my old haunts) but the mini bar is actually quite reasonable but heck, there's a 7-eleven aross th street.Ok, the rooms admittedly are a bit smallish. If you're traveling with someone or need a work space, definitely get the suite. But I've also traveled there by myself and stayed in a cozy king and like the namesake, it is quite cozy, just not quite big enough for two people but nevertheless I've enjoyed my stay in that room type. Bed and linens and linens...amazing. What keeps me coming back is that they remember their returning guests and the last two times the doorman greeting me by name getting out of the cab from the airport. It is a chic hotel, but it doesn't mean you have to be a snob to stay there. Say hello to the people who work there, they are human afterall. I find them to be a friendly bunch.Like we teach our children, treat others as you want to be treated and if that doesn't work, then definitely bring it up with management. I acknowledge that people do have bad experiences in hotels but in reading the reviews on this site, I think that just needs to be said.Just reporting my experience and opinion at this hotel. I just wish that the corporation that runs this hotel had more places in the areas I travel frequently to. They make me feel like I've come home."
22,172,"Sep 22 2009 	Needs Improvement	We picked the Dana Hotel for an overnight Sunday stay because we wanted to be closer to the shopping areas, and support a boutique hotel. We foresake our typical choice of staying at the Stellar Burnham Hotel, for Dana. We found our stay disappointing. Perhaps it's the economy or the staff was too tired from the weekend revellers and didn't give much attention to those staying there on a Sunday night. We're not fussy travellers and don't need much apart from courteous, competent service. We didn't have that experience at the Dana. I'll highlight some of the good and bad points we experienced.-- Positives:Awesome bed.Comfortable room: we have an asian inspired, cotemporary waterfront condo and were pleased with the decor.--Negatives:Check-in staff seemed like they were trying to replicate a cool, youthful, aloof urban energy. It came off as apathetic. One got the feeling that they were doing this job until they went to their &quot;real jobs&quot; later on.Does this place really have a spa? Every time I have ever checked into a hotel that has a spa ... they at least tell you a little about it. This is true whether I have stayed at destination spa locations, or hotels where the spa is an amenity for a predominantly business clientele.-- Aja Steak: was pleased with the subbtle Hawaiian flair in the menu. Fish was good quality. I think we got left-over rice on our maki, because it was terrible. Service was lower than average. Perhaps we got the Sunday, C level staff. They were poorly trained ....and I almost felt like piping up &quot; ummmm ...are there any adults running this place?&quot;We have travelled internationally and stayed at numerous hotels. My basic rule is that if a place has an expensive, diverse selection of sakis and wines with limited descriptors; they should have someone on staff to discuss the selections. They didn't that night. Worse still, we had a flaky waitress who did not even seem to understand the qualitative distinctions between the food &amp; drink selections on the menu. In an effort to be friendly/knowledgeable she tried to pipe in how did not know much about sakes ... but she loved the junmai daiginjo sakes. Her comment would have been acceptable if she knew what she was talking about (we are avid sake drinkers); but it's like someone who knows nothing about the varied construction &amp; mechanisms in watches saying how they love the quality and mastery of how Cartier watches are built.Next time, we'll stick to the Burnham Hotel. Kimpton just gets how to do boutique hotels, and they have shown that prowess nationally and internationally. Besides, they are in the same price range as the Dana."
23,172,"Aug 25 2009 	Loved the experience.. few things to improve on.	I stayed at the Dana Hotel while on a business trip and was pleased with the stay. Hotel dcor is very modern. Some may like it, some wont. I loved it. My room (23rd FL Serene King) was very comfortable, clean and I truly felt at home. What I liked: Detail, details, details. They definitely get kudos for keeping the needs of a traveler in mind. The bed, bedding, pillows and sheets were very soft and relaxing. I loved the hardwood floor. The bathroom shower has a glass wall that looks out to the room and has a rainfall showerhead. They have a real hair dryer in the bathroom, not the cheap ones attached to the wall of many hotels. (Ladies, you know what I mean.) Very nice spa quality toiletries, cotton balls, Q-tips, bath robes, slippers and extra towels. Mini bar is stocked very nicely along with a good selection of condiments: dried fruits, snacks, etc. My room also had an MP3 connection so I listened to my ipod in the room. Flat screen TV, coffee maker and a large desk allowing me much needed work space.I had dinner at the hotel restaurant ajasteak and was very pleased with the quality of food and service. Their prime beef carpaccio is one of the best Ive had and the maki roll portions are very generous. After dinner, when I went back to my room, they had provided a turn-down service and left a couple of their chocolate dipped fortune cookies on the bed. Yum. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to check out vertigo sky lounge, but heard it was great .Areas needing improvements:For all the right they did, there were two things that I found very frustrating. First is the temperature of the room. I had the thermostat set to 60 in hopes of keeping the room cool! (I generally like the room temp in the low 70s.) Despite lowering it, the room still got very warm at times. It almost felt like the AC had a mind of its own and worked great at times then stop working all together. Second, I was very excited to see the self check-in machines by the front desk thinking I can check-in with my airline and print the boarding pass early. Well, it recognized my flight itineraries but wouldnt print the boarding pass. Oh well.Overall, a great hotel with friendly staff. I would recommend this hotel and will stay here again in the future."
24,172,Aug 24 2009 	great place to stay	Excellent hotel. Good location. Very good rooms and friendly staff. Breakfast was great too.
25,172,"Aug 19 2009 	Magnificient hotel with breathtaking views on the City	I stayed in the Dana Hotel for 5 nights in June 2009, and really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed the contemporary architecture and was really pleased with the comfort of my room.It was well equipped : large bed, large TV, large bathroom and a wonderful sound system for my Ipod (Zeppelin from Bower &amp; Wilkins).Breakfast was a bit disappointing, but the restaurant was fabulous...anyway, due to a central location in the Loop, it 's not difficult to find a good restaurant in the neighborhood...To conclude, I spent an excellent stay in this hotel and feel sure to return there ASAP..."
26,172,"Aug 17 2009 	Eye candy sexy night for a couple	The interior design from the lobby to the room is really classy and modern. Front Desk staff was very friendly. Room was super clean and if you're looking for a sexy place to stay with your significant other, this is it. The bathroom shower shared a common wall with the bedroom...except it was glass, not a wall. There's a curtain you can pull if you want to but, who wants to? I wouldn't necessarily say that the view outside was too appetizing, as you can see straight across into the condos, so no good view of the city really."
27,172,"Aug 12 2009 	Excellent hotel 	Stayed in the Dana for five nights to explore Chicago. Got upgraded from a Serene King to a Corner King. This means, I had two of the four walls with windows from floor to ceiling. Location is excellent as I could walk everywhere (approx. 25 minutes to Millenium Park, 10 min. to John Hancock Building - all along Michigan Avenue). Facilities of the hotel are excellent, the room is fully equipped with all mod-cons. The best was the view from the room - all around to the street below and the neighbouring buildings. Service was conscientious and always very friendly. There was no complimentary continental breakfast anymore, but I got USD 15.-- vouchers for breakfast - so I could chose what I liked. Wheater permitting, I could sit outside. There is some traffic noise from the streets below, which is normal in the midst of a big city. I can recommend the hotel if you want to stay in an unstuffy, friendly, modern and well-serviced place."
28,172,"Aug 10 2009 	Great value but far from perfect	Enjoyed three nights at Dana from August 1 - 4. The hotel is very modern, perfectly located, clean and well priced. We managed to get it at $105 Cdn per night. Problems we encountered: The room was very small and dark. We were on the backside of the hotel and the window was only a patio door. Made the room depressing, but we did not spend much time in the room during the day. Room was also not well positioned. The TV was facing the side of the bed, rather than at the foot. As there was no sitting area, watching TV was difficult. Finally, the Dana advertised that a continental breakfast was included in the price. They cancelled the breakfast starting August 3rd but failed to tell anyone. Very misleading.The good part: The staff is very friendly. The concierge (Aleksandra) was extremely helpful and spot on with her restaurant recommendations. She even tried to make up for the cancelled breakfast by offering a complimentary bottle of wine from the room. By the way, the bar fridge selection in the room is good and well priced. Excellent Ipod speakers in the room. At this price, I would stay again, but get a room in the front of the building."
29,172,"Aug 5 2009 	Anniversary trip in Chicago	My husband and I stayed at the Dana Hotel for our anniversary weekend. It is a very hip hotel. It is set up for a younger crowd. I would not recommend staying here if you are older and have children. The location is perfect. It is close to Michigan Avenue but just enough away from it too. The staff was very accomodating and friendly. We stayed on the 25th floor which I would not recommend if you want to sleep. The club on the 26th floor plays loud music until early in the morning and you can hear it. My husband and I used the spa too. The massage therapists were wonderful! Recommend the couples harmony massages. The relaxation room needs more tranquility and comfortable chairs. The locker rooms were very nice with all the amenties that you need. The elevators were my only real complaint. They are slow and you have to use your room card to get it to work, which does not work most of the time."
30,172,"Aug 4 2009 	Nice place trying a little too hard?	We stayed for the weekend for purposes of doing a running race in Grant Park on Sunday, but wanted to also enjoy the city for dining, etc. as we typically do once a year. The location is great (though the construction on the opposite corner very early on Monday morning would have been maddening, had we not been awake on Eastern time) and central to walk to many restaurants and shops. Check-in was fine, and they obliged us with late check-out, as well. Overall hotel service was good, but the waitstaff working the complimentary continental breakfast was incompetent and rude. Valet parking was $38/night (cha-ching), and we were glad upon leaving that we didn't have to take the car in and out over the weekend, as we waited for almost 15 minutes for our car and were the only people standing there.Our room was one of the corner rooms with floor to ceiling windows, and generally decorated in good (modern) taste. We did not have a safe in the room, which we did not discover until having unpacked, and the front desk's only suggestion was to move us to another room. ugh. We didn't really get the whole &quot;zen&quot; thing they market. I had a spa treatment after the race on Sunday, and thoroughly enjoyed the massage--the therapist was great--but it was overpriced and the rest of the spa staff was fairly inept. They put me in a relaxation room to wait for my therapist, did not offer refreshments, and just didn't seem to know how to handle themselves. Some of the finishes seemed a bit shoddy or too quickly done. My biggest gripe was really that the whole placing was trying too hard to be hip and ultra-trendy, possibly at the expense of what could have been elegant and chic (house music constantly playing in the common areas of the hotel, a staff with purposefully wild hair-do's, etc etc etc). We were pleasantly surprised at the &quot;honor bar&quot; prices and really enjoyed our 1/2 bottle of Veuve for only $32 as a nice way to start the weekend. We only paid $125/night on a promo on a non-hotel affiliated website, and so were fine with the value we received, but would likely not return."
31,172,"Jul 31 2009 	Generally nice but lacks good service	Small, overcrowded reception area, snappy hostess upon reception telling us to go upstairs to check in (as if we were stupid not to know that), two separate very busy elevators needed to get to room, luggage was very late finding its way to the room (2 calls needed to hunt it down), internet that didn't work for 1 1/2 of our 3 days there, but worst of all was the very, very bad service at the restaurant: we got the feeling we were putting them out (way out!) by showing up and asking for our continental breakfast. For that alone, I won't be back."
32,172,"Jul 29 2009 	Awesome Weekend	My wife and I stayed at the Dana for our honeymoon, and it was, in her words &quot;urban decadence&quot;. We loved the hotel itself, the food was incredible and the location is great for anyone visiting Chicago. We only wish we had more time there."
33,172,"Jul 27 2009 	Outstanding! Had our annual client meeting here....terrific!	We had 50 of our clients attend a two day meeting at the Dana Hotel. Most were from out of town so they booked a room. We had 100% positive client feedback! The meeting room was perfect, the food was wonderful and the service was impecable! We will book all client meetings at the Dana."
34,172,"Jul 23 2009 	Stay here at your own risk...	Do NOT choose the Dana Hotel if you value honest staff! I recently visited here for a business event. Since parking in downtown Chicago is always a pricey hassle, I was happy to learn guests of the event would have free valet parking for their one night stay (as advertised by event organizers and promised by hotel staff upon our arrival.) At the hotel, I double-checked about complimentary parking to ensure I wouldn't have any surprise charges popping up. I was assured by the hotel bellman &quot;Yes, parking is complimentary,&quot; so we decided to go valet. But, sure enough at the end of my stay, I was smacked with valet parking fees! What?! The hotel manager only offered me (and the couple dozen other hotel guests who were also promised free parking) a deficient &quot;Sorry, you'll have to pay for parking.&quot; Needless to say I was furious, not because I had to pay for parking, but because we were LIED TO by hotel staff and dismissed by a manager who would not step up to right a glaring &quot;wrong.&quot; I would not visit the Dana again or recommend this hotel to anyone - friend or foe."
35,172,"Jul 16 2009 	Modern straight forward boutique	Some people may find the rooms austere. I liked it - concrete ceilings, all glass exterior wall, dark furniture... The hotel offered a great list of features, iPod dock, large flatscreen, free internet, great office chairs, rain shower with another handheld wand, free continental breakfast for two (which was great because my colleague was staying at another hotel and the Dana let him join me for breakfast everyday).This is my new hotel of choice for a quick trip to Chi-town."
36,172,"Jul 10 2009 	Dana is DANG good...	If you like whole foods, friendly people, attentive staff, and comfy beds then this hotel is for you...First off, as a Naturalist I loved that Whole Foods, and Trader Joes are right around the corner from this place. I loved that it took all of 3 minutes to walk to the magnificent mile. I loved that so many great restaurants (including the Tempo Cafe and the West Egg) were right close and so yummy.Second, the rooms are so rad! The beds are so comfy here. The glass shower open to the room (if you want it to be) was so sensual and fun. My husband and I came on a trip to Chicago to visit the taste of Chicago and this hotel was the perfect stay for it. FYI - there are very few hotels downtown that offer FREE wi-fi in your room AND continental breakfast. Try to find it, you'll be hard-pressed. This hotel is only a couple years old and very well build. The rooms are small but comfy and ours had a little balcony which my husband proceeded to enjoy spitting off of. The ipod dock was sick! It had such good bass and really came in handy for us. The shower was heavenly and it made you linger in it along time. The only complaint we had was that our rooms air was not working properly but when we called maintenance they were there in a flash and fixed it right away and even offered us a free breakfast (besides the continental) for our trouble! The bed envelopes you and carries you off into sleepy town...that is of course if you don't have a room by the elevator which I would recommend not having since you can hear it alot. But it was great anyway, we slept well, especially with soothing music playing on my ipod through the dock station while we slept. I loved the bamboo toiletries and the Kuirig Coffee Maker (oh my gosh) I have to have one!!!!! The hotel must have known I was coming too, because they had Green Mountain Organic Fair Trade Coffee too!!! My Favorite! As you can see they won me over, and they will you too! A few tips:Make sure and sit down in the lobby if you expect the continental breakfast, otherwise there is just yogurt for you to take to the room. They will offer you a roll or a danish if you sit down. Also, try the fitness center, it is great! I love the free-motion equipment. And ask for a room away from elevators and visit they concierge for lots of coupons for surrounding activities and restaurants. Don't be afraid to ask for anything - this hotel is very accomodating!"
37,172,"Jul 10 2009 	Absolutely fantastic!	loved the super soft bed. The view was spectacular, the staff was great. They have a complimentary continental breakfast that is a bowl of fresh fruit, youghurt, and croissants or scones, coffee in big saucer cups and juices. Free high speed wifi was an added bonus!"
38,172,"Jul 6 2009 	Could've been great ... too bad it wasn't.	My wife, who just so happens to be named Dana, spent our first weekend alone since our first child was born eight weeks ago. I researched downtown Chicago hotels for weeks and finally decided on The Dana after reading so many wonderful reviews.I called the hotel about a week ahead of our arrival and asked them for three small requests.1. We wanted a king bed. This certainly didnt seem like much to ask. It was just my wife and I, so that makes plenty of sense anyway.2. We need a room with a refrigerator. Since my wife is breast feeding, she needed to keep the milk chilled for the weekend.3. If possible, an upper level room with a view.Upon arriving at the Dana, we were greeted very pleasantly by the door staff and escorted to the front desk on the second floor. After a very short wait, we were quickly given our room card and headed up to our room. The room was the complete opposite of what we requested: Two double beds, no refrigerator and a 12th floor view of the side of a building. I immediately went back down to the desk and let them know we needed a new room and their response was basically Were booked, too bad. When we explained we needed a refrigerator and we were already told by phone it wouldnt be a problem, their response was again Your room doesnt come with a refrigerator, too bad. Ive never experienced a front desk that was so unhelpful. It wasnt exactly the way I wanted to start our weekend.Fortunately, the check-in was the lowlight of the trip. Despite the fact my wife and I slept in separate beds, had to make God knows how many trips to the ice machine (which is hidden in a closet on the fifth floor) and gazed out of our window into an office building, I slowly warmed up to The Dana and eventually left the hotel with a feeling that I might, just maybe, stay there once again.POSITIVES1. Location. You cant beat staying right in the heart of downtown Chicago within walking distance of everything that makes this city so wonderful. Dining, shopping, beach, nightlife  You are right in the middle of all of it.2. Vertigo. The hotel has one of the best rooftop lounges in Chicago. It was packed both nights we were there and the views from 27 stories above were fantastic. The drinks were great. The staff was helpful. Good crowd. Great place.3. Shower. Its a one-of-a-kind with a rain head spout from the ceiling and glass on both sides separating the bedroom and the bathroom. Its about as nice of a hotel bathroom as youre going to find.4. Complimentary breakfast. It was so nice to be able to walk downstairs and sit down and be served a perfectly, light meal. They brought a really good fruit bowl with the choice of pastry and quality coffee and juices. It was very simple and very good.5. Door staff. The guys at the front door go out of their way to make you feel special. Any request was quickly answered and, unlike the front desk staff, they were very pleasant and genuine.NEGATIVES1. Front desk. Ive already covered it all with them. You would think a hotel would employ its most helpful workers for this position, not the opposite. The front desk staff was a joke. Completely clueless and just flat out insulting.2. Elevator. This might sound like Im being picky, but I cant tell you how many times I was in the elevator and another person was mumbling expletives as they battled with the elevator. In order to push the button of your floor, you have to very quickly insert your room card and then make your choice. This is much easier said than done because every single person on the elevator has to do it in order to select your floor. Its almost like trying to feed a crumbled dollar bill into a vending machine under pressure. Its incredibly annoying and if you dont do it quickly, you miss your floor and have to ride the elevator down to the lobby again. I appreciate the security, but I truly believe this is the hotels way of trying to be hip and in turn just pissing a lot of people off.3. Thin walls. I had the stereo playing at low volume and within minutes the hotel security was knocking. If you need to sleep, this isnt the hotel for you.4. Trying too hard. This hotel desperately wants to be young and hip. Its not young by any means and its not really all that hip. This place is loaded with middle-agers (40-50 crowd) and all of their attempts at being cool kind of fall short. Example: To get into the rooftop club, you have to briefly stand behind a velvet rope even if the damn place is empty. I could probably give you 10 examples of stuff like that. The ceilings in the room are unfinished cement. Trendy or an eye sore? I definitely thought the latter.5. Ice machine. Call and ask guest services where the ice machine is located. They will tell you its on the fifth floor. If you can find it in less than 10 minutes, Ill be impressed. There are a lot of things at this hotel where you just scratch your head and think, what the @#$% were they thinking?"
39,172,"Jun 25 2009 	An oasis in the heart of the city	It was a very nice hotel, the beds were great, and I loved the chocolate dipped fortune cookies that came with the turn-down service. Service staff was professional and courteous without being ingratiating. The continental breakfast was very good."
40,172,"Jun 15 2009 	Cool hotel I'd stay there again	Didn't know much about this place until we got there, nice bar in the lobby and another on the rooftop, swanky atmosphere all around, but comfortable. Rooftop bar got packed at night with a nice looking crowd, there was a model show while we were there, lucky timing on our part. Staff was excellent and extremely helpful with a couple reservation hiccups, I booked through a third party name your price site and it got a little screwy, but since I had my confirmation numbers everything was sorted out quickly. Definitely more of a place for couples but we were there for a bachelor party and no one seemed to mind either way. Good location, and price, I'd recommend it to anyone."
41,172,"Jun 12 2009 	Clean trendy Hotel in a great location....	My wife and I wanted to get into Chicago for 1 night, since the kids school year just came to a halt. 24 hours to do whatever we wanted and not worry about the clock or deadlines. The hotel is in a very cool neighborhood in the city with lots of shopping, cool restaurants and Lake Michigan and the Chicago River within walking distance. The rooms were soooo cool with a see through shower, wood floors, cool artwork, comfortable bedding, clean, clean, clean....and awesome views out our windows. THey also have a rooftop club called Vertigo which was awesome with views of the city, a firepit , trendy music and good drinks. THe restaurant is awesome and they give give compliemtary continental breakfast in the a.,m......fresh fruit , cinnamon rolls, homemade OJ , and grapefruit juice....We went to a theater a few blocks away, went to dinner at the restaurant and the nite club. It's a hotel for couples....not for kids....but there is nothing wrong with that !!"
42,172,"Jun 8 2009 	New fresh and good location	very modern with reasonable pricing! PLUS, you get a cont. breakfast with Julius Meinl coffee, free wireless,...all very nice. The gym is small but nice..the locker rooms have steam showers which are clean.Front desk and concierge were friendly! All in all, great experience.. rooms are not huge (but the tv was!)...so, good for couples or singles unless you upgrade to a suite...FYI - the see through shower is cool, but I would NOT stay in a room with just a friend or my parent..there is a curtain that you can pull, but it is a bit odd.VERY nice bath, though"
43,172,"Jun 5 2009 	Trendy upscale and new. Great downtown location	The hotel seems to be very new, probably opened in 2008. The design of the hotel, the rooms, and the attached restuarant and bar is very reminiscent of the W Hotels. Quite trendy, but very nice. The rooms featured partial hardwood floors and very nice furniture/fixtures/TV, etc. Floor to cieling windows with black-out shades. Would highly recommend. Free computers with internet access were very usefull."
44,172,"Jun 3 2009 	Very nice	I stayed here with my husband and children at the end of May for a weekend sightseeing trip. The location is pretty good, just a couple of blocks from the Mag Mile. We walked to the Sears Tower and Navy Pier and Millennium Park, but it was a pretty long walk.We had a Tranquil Suite which was very nice. Housekeeping was excellent and everything was very clean. Checking in was a breeze. The continental breakfast was very high quality and service was very good.Overall, I could find no faults with this hotel other than it may be a little farther walk to sightseeing destinations than others. It was a nice place and I would stay here again."
45,172,"Jun 1 2009 	Cool modern hotel	Had a great long weekend stay here. The rooms are modern and spacious, complete with hardwood floorsa nice alternative to grungy hotel carpet. But beware, theyre a bit slippery! And I wish theyd done the entire room in hardwoods; theres carpet surrounding the bed. Speaking of the bed, its quite possibly the most comfortable that Ive ever slept in. Theres also FREE wi-fi in the room, which is a big plus in my book. Didnt partake of the mini-bar but was pleasantly surprised to see how reasonable the prices were.Noise was a bit of an issue; our room was on the 8th floor, corner of Erie and State, and we heard quite a bit of street noise especially at night (or the occasional 3:30 a.m. brawl). The only other complaint is the annoying elevator security system which was slightly tempermental. Our stay included a free continental breakfast which was pretty typical  bagels, croissants, scones, cereal, fruit and yogurt. Loads of Starbucks nearby, too.Checked out the Vertigo Sky Lounge on the Friday night that we were there, before heading elsewhere. The view is great  perfect for a nice spring/summer night. Its a bit to scene-y for my taste, especially with the silly velvet rope at the entrance. Dont think thats necessary although there was a line to get in around 11 p.m. Drinks are pretty reasonably-priced, though, in my opinion.Location really cant be beat for checking out the city."
46,172,"May 22 2009 	Beautiful hotel with vapid inattentive staff	Beautiful hotel coupled with unprofessional and inattentive staff equals pretty vacant experience. We stayed in the standard room which still afforded ceiling to floor glass windows, beautiful glass showers, and city views in this newer high rise hotel in downtown Chicago. Really the only negative was the unprofessional staff. Several times during the stay there was no hot water. Apparently they were having a hot water problem and the engineering staff had no clue what they were doing. He came into the room, tested out the shower and said, &quot;you're right there is no hot water and I have no idea why but it should be fixed in a few hours.&quot; The manager who sounded like he was in his 20s, very inarticulate and unhelpful promised a discount for a future stay which never came into fruition. A frustrating experience not having hot water, not being able to shower at your convenience, showering in different hotel rooms and empty promises from unprofessional, incompetent, juvenile staff put a damper on what could have been a perfect experience. Additionally, skip the mediocre over-priced food in their restaurant and room service."
47,172,"May 20 2009 	Interesting but not for everyone	Dana Hotel and Spa is very new and is oriented to tech-savvy people who like industrial chic design. The service is great. A good continental breakfast of fresh food is provided. As for the room, the flat screen TV, iPod dock, showerhead on the ceiling and especially the floor-to-ceiling windows are fun. The bed was a bit soft and I didn't like the exposed concrete walls and minimal lighting but these are matters of taste. Also there was traffic noise (on the 17th floor) and from the elevator which our room was near. A glass wall with just a curtain separates the bathroom/shower and the room. The staff leaves the curtain open and also raises the window shades when they make up the room so you have to remember to pull it closed when you return and use the bathroom. We stayed 4 days and I never figured out the TV menu or the elevator security system. Also, oddly, the free wireless internet had some problem with Yahoo - I was never able to check my email although most other websites worked fine. The location was great, I like the rooftop bar, and the 4th night free deal made it a good value since we were staying 4 nights. But I probably will choose more conventional lodging if I'm back in Chicago."
48,172,"May 19 2009 	Great Value off the Mag Mile!	The location is right off the mag mile where there are lots of restaurants and bars for night life. The valet met us as the cab pulled up. The staff was all friendly-particularly the bellhops. We had a corner room and it rocked!! Very clean and the housekeeping was easily accessible for extra towels, etc. The consierge desk was extra helpful as we were trying to find a bar to play the Brewers/Cardinals game (not hard in Cubs town!). The only downfall was slow service at the bar. Breakfast service was prompt and friendly and it was nice to have a complimentary breakfast included in the stay. We didn't get room service but used the in room fridge and it was more than reasonable compared to other hotels in Chicago. We booked the 3 nights so we saved 25%. We have stayed at the Drake and Hard Rock (worst hotel stay in the city I've had) in the past, and while the view of the Drake over Lake Michigan was spectacular, the room at the Dana was much cleaner and newer and the valet staff had much more urgency at the Dana. This is an ideal hotel also if you are using public transportation around the city. Only 2 blocks from the redline which gets you all over the main stops in the city-or to jump onto other lines to get into the neighborhoods. We will for sure visit the Dana again soon."
49,172,"May 13 2009 	Modern and stylish hotel in a great location but perhaps too modern for some.	We stayed at the Dana Hotel and Spa for 4 nights and had a great time. It's location is perfect for travel from the airport via the subway/El, and we walked to shopping, restaurants, bars, and tourist spots from there. The rooms are very modern and stylish, with a few design issues that might make some people uncomfortable. Our room had great ceiling to floor windows with sun shade panels and blackout panels behind those. Because each shade is a panel, you do have some space between each one, which allowed light to come through. If you need a completely dark room to sleep, you might have an issue. We heard some noise on Saturday night, and our room was right in front of the elevators, so we sometimes heard people getting on and off, but nothing was too disturbing. As far as the &quot;famous&quot; glass shower window, there is plenty of privacy with the curtain drawn. However, if someone uses the bathroom in the middle of the night, the light illuminates the rest of the bedroom. Perhaps a blackout shade there would be more appropriate. The shower enclosure only has small a glass wall, and the bathroom floor can get a bit wet as a result. The bed was very comfy. We really enjoyed the mini-bar selections and wine selections, and all had reasonable prices.We went up to the Vertigo Lounge for a little bit, and while we aren't clubby people, it had a good vibe and was very busy. The view is awesome, and there is a nice outdoor area.We enjoyed our stay and would certainly return to this hotel."
50,172,"May 4 2009 	Fun Hotel in a Perfect Location	A friend and I just finished a stay at the Dana and loved it! The location on State Street was ideal --- easy walk to Michigan Avenue, Lincoln Park, Gold Coast area, etc. Tons of restaurants, shopping, and bars within minutes on foot. Decor is sleek and contemporary, loved the fun shower that looks into the room (with a curtain), beds were incredibly comfortable with great sheets, wireless internet was reliable, and everything was pretty tasteful. The hotel's club has fantastic views, even if the staff's outfits were pretty trashy, and overall service was great. I'd say the staff is relatively young and inexperienced by Four Seasons standards, but they were efficient and helpful when needed. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but it was gorgeous.The only downsides for us were the poor sound insulation between rooms and the hallway, room a/c that never seemed to get cold enough, and having to take the elevator + stairs or 2 separate elevators each time you go from the room to street level (lobby is on the second floor).Overall I thought it was a fun, stylish, well-located property and an excellent value. We'd stay again without hesitation."
51,172,"Apr 28 2009 	The Dana Hotel and Spa should be your ONLY choice!	We just finished a 2 night stay at the Dana in their Corner King room. From the second we walked in to the time we left, this hotel exceeded all of our expectations. The staff is fantastic and friendly, the hotel is swanky yet comfortable, and the location is second to none. We can't say enough good things about this hotel and our experience here during our 1st Wedding Anniversary. We even called within the first few hours and recommended it to our friends who are planning their trip to Chicago. The choice to stay at the Dana was somewhat by luck, but the next time it will be due to the experience."
52,172,"Apr 27 2009 	Amazing...perfect Chicago hotel!!!	This place is breathtaking. We paid $119 plus tax a night and stayed for 5 nights, and it was a great experience. Our room was gorgeous and spacy. We stayed on the 19th floor and had a no balcony king. The layout was so unique and modern. The bathroom and shower was AMAZING, I could have stayed in there for hours!Customer service was 10/10. They helped with directions, we had leftover pizza and room service heated it up for u (ofcourse we tipped them). Rooms were clean and beautiful. There was a wierd celing design which makes it look dingy, but we realized this was the plan. This is THE MOST comfortable bed I have slept in in my LIFE! The only one minor complaint I had was that the AC only cooled so much and it could get a tad warm after showering.. We are people who like the room freezing cold, but it was still comfortable. Breakfast was decent. No eggs, waffles, but they had these delicious scones! The location is as good as it gets! Right near great restaruants, subway, the mag mile, and the Amtrak station.I would give this hotel a 10+/10. LOVED IT and hoped we get to come back real soon. if the rates are decent, this is the only hotel we would ever stay at in Chicago from now oN!"
53,172,"Apr 20 2009 	Loved it.	I stayed at the Dana as a part of a group. One of the best chic hotels I have stayed at in a long time. The room was a little small but the layout makes up for it. Being a business traveller, I like having desk space and a sitting area and this room had both. the bed was very comfortable and I loved the linens. Made for a good nights sleep. The sirens outside and traffic noise doesn't normally bother me but having walked the downtown areas of Chicago, this would be a problem no matter where you stay. Folks.... check out the shower. I will return just for that. No regular hotel showers here. The pressure was perfect and the rainfall effect was amazing. The bathroom was big and made getting ready in the morning that much easier. The IPOD docking station was great. I have an Ipod touch and I could actually watch my videos on the TV. Easy to use and made my stay even better. Staff were good although some of my group complained that they were a little rude. I didn't experience that at all. The bar on the roof was a little upscale. the servers acted as if you were bothering them but it seemed like this was the atmosphere they want up there. If I go back to Chicago on business, I will go back, that's for sure"
54,172,Apr 16 2009 	Fabulous boutique hotel-perfect location	Stayed at the Dana for the second time this past weekend and again had a wonderful time. The floor to ceiling windows are amazing overlooking the city. The staff is very friendly and very attentive. Had an initial problem with the wireless but they moved me a different (and better!) room and it was fine. Room service is great as are the beds and amenities. Highly recommend if you're planning a trip to the windy city!
55,172,"Apr 13 2009 	Great stay at the Dana Hotel and Spa	Last week, I stayed at the Dana Hotel for 5 nights and was absolutely delighted by the hotel, staff and surroundings.Lets start with the location which is 2-3 blocks from Michigan Ave and the heart of major shopping. On the other side of the spectrum, the hotel also has a Trader Joes, Whole Foods and Walgreens within one block of the hotel which is great for snacks, meals on the go and anything else you may have left behind. My room was extremely spacious and had a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was huge with great amenities (larger than usual shampoo, conditioner etc.). Big fluffy towels too. It took me a couple of days to realize that my room was handicapped accessible  which explained why there was no dividing ledge between the bathroom and shower, and a pull down bar next to the toilet. It also explained why the closet armoire was very low to the ground. However the room still appeared cozy and chic which is different from many handicap accessible rooms where Ive stayed in the past. The hotel offered nightly turndown service with chocolate covered fortune cookies. The service included pulling down the shades and room darkeners which is key because there is a apartment building directly across with a direct view into your room. Be careful getting dressed because I could see everything that the apartment dwellers were doing, so Im guessing that they could see me as well. My only complaint with the hotel is that the walls were extremely thin. I had a toddler and baby in the room next to me for my entire stay and believe me when I say that I heard every cry. Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely return for a return visit. Free wireless internet and continental breakfast rocked! The staff went out of its way to please. Special kudos to TJ, at the bell desk, who always had a great attitude, even when it was freezing outside."
56,172,"Apr 10 2009 	Perfect Boutique Hotel. When Can We Go Back?!	My husband and I had an amazing weekend stay in Chicago (my first time visiting) thanks in generous part to the Dana Hotel. After booking online, I called a couple of days before our arrival date to confirm the reservation. For some reason they had us booked into a wheelchair-accessible room (I neither needed one or requested one), but that was easily changed with my phone call. We stayed in a Serene King on the upper floor I had requested. Great view--the room had a wall of nothing but floor-to-ceiling windows--and super clean. The chocolate minibar items available were unique and delicious, though expectedly pricey ($4 bag of double chocolate coated malted milk balls, for example). And if you are really into hotel bathrooms like I am, believe me, the Dana Hotel's shower MUST be experienced. The entire staff--from the valet guys to the front desk personnel to the housekeeping ladies to the servers in the exceptional Ajasteak restaurant downstairs--was polite and accommodating, but a special shout-out must go to the concierge staff--Tim and Aleksandra. Both of them took the time to ask us questions and discover our tastes before making recommendations on what to do and where to eat. Thanks to them I felt like we were experiencing a local's Chicago rather than a tourist's Chicago. Very much appreciated. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and stay at the Dana again."
57,172,"Apr 7 2009 	Early problems resolved	This was my second visit to the Dana having booked a room in the first few months of its opening. Any new hotel needs a few months to iron out early problems and they seem to have worked hard to achieve this. My room was immaculate, clean and well designed. Service was much better as was the food. The sky bar is very much the 'in' place. This was the first time I have stayed in the same Chicago Hotel and I am glad I did. Would be more than happy to stay there again."
58,172,"Apr 3 2009 	Super Cool Boutique	My wife and I stayed here for one night and also used the spa services.I got a deep tissue massage which was awesome, my wife got a facial. The place was very clean and the staff was pleasant and accommodating.The hotel itself is very hip, it has a real club feel. The first floor bar and second floor lobby have a good layout, great decoration and in the evening they are comfortably crowded with a nice atmosphere.The rooms are unique but very comfortable. Great view out the floor to ceiling window and you can tell that everything is new. Quick note on the shower  it shares a wall/glass window with the room. The glass is covered with a curtain, but if you want to you can open the curtain from the room to have a full view of the shower in use.pretty fun.Overall, this place is awesome and a great place for Chicago."
59,172,"Apr 3 2009 	A Diamond in a sea of coal....	Stayed at Dana on the recommendation of a Chicago native and totally enjoyed the location, the staff and the hotel. I travel to Chicago several times a year and been trying to find a place this is not a huge faceless chain but not so small to miss good amenities in the area I need to be. In short, the Dana is the place. The staff is very attentive and pleasant and the modern dcor is nice to look at without sacrificing the needs of the business traveler. I had great views from the 18th floor with the balcony. A previous reviewer mentioned the small size of the balcony but I thought it was great place to just step outside, get some fresh air, enjoy the view and listen to the sounds of the church bells/song a few blocks away. The wine chiller/mini bar is great! The selection was good and the rates were reasonable for a full bottle of wine in your room. It was nice to be able to open and drink half and save the other half for the next night. As for the shower with the full glass into the bed area, it was a bit unnerving at first but I got over it when I realized there was both a hand-held shower head AND a rain shower above. The effective use of space and dual use of the bathroom/closet door was a great design element. Not to mention the great B&amp;W stereo with the iPod/Phone dock. I did not realize until the second day you can get the television to play through the cool stereo for better sound. I was out of the hotel too early most days to enjoy the breakfast but my travel mate said it was very good and a bit above the usual continental breakfast fare. The only issue I had was rude and inconsiderate neighbors across the hall. The doors are solid but with a big gap at the bottom of the door that allowed the screaming/laughing/crying of the women across the hall to filter into the room. Understand, they felt the need to shout at each other when one was standing in their doorway on several occasions. I ended up stuffing the big fluffy bath mat into the gap and all was well. Not sure what their deal was but thankfully they left after a day or so and the rest of my stay was quiet. In the area there are plenty of big chain boring assembly line hotels to stay at greater cost than the Dana. If you want to be one of a thousand, by all means stay there. If you want a personal experience that is about more than just your big chain hotel points, then check out the Dana!All in all, the Dana was a great place to stay with dcor, staff and amenities I would expect at much pricier places without half the style of this great find. I will definitely be making the Dana my new place to stay in Chicago!HINT: The doors to rooms ending in &quot;-08&quot; and &quot;-10&quot; are directly across from the elevators. If absolute quiet is essential to you, might want to request not being right across from elevators."
60,172,"Apr 2 2009 	A great Chicago Choice-Different and Fun	Just finished 5 days at the Dana Hotel and Spa. It is has the current pseudo-Asian feel that is still popular. Rooms are excellent; lights of view and light with a unique design. The beds were a big rave among everyone; you did not want to get up. The room decor has some fun quirks that make it interesting. Work space and internet were outstanding. Great for business or a romantic city visit.Service was outstanding in many ways. Housekeeping was strong. Maintenace was prompt and friendly and corrected a problem in minutes (Scott?). Extra service from the management was appreciated (James). Concierge was fun and informative and passionate about Chicago (Alexandra). Would work on the brunch and food/beverage service; they looked fantastic but service ws cold and slowish. Not a big problem; there are lots of great restaurants walking distance. It was wierd to stand with my luggage and have the front desk chilling in chairs, but hey.....different is good, too. Wierd reception concept; time will tell.Overall, it was a truly great comfortable experience. I appreciate the risk they are taking in changing set concepts. If you look at the other reviews, it is paying off. Thank you for a good time."
61,172,"Mar 26 2009 	It's My New Favorite Spot - You will Love the Dana	My friend and I frequent Chicago often and we have stayed all over downtown for work and play. I love the Dana Hotel! The view was amazing from my room (2102). We had floor to ceiling windows from the doorway to the bed. We witnessed the most amazing sunrise from bed. (We pulled the blinds the first night.) We went to the Vertigo Sky Lounge for drinks Saturday night. It was a awesome for dancing and cuddling by the fire pit. The staff wanted to make us happy, feel welcome, and exceed our expectations of a quality stay. I must say that I will be making reservations at the Dana from now on."
62,172,"Mar 20 2009 	Better than the Chicago megahotels!	Slightly pretentious, not all reception staff were friendly and outgoing; as I checked out the guy on reception was fingering his finger ring all nonchalant like and uninterested.Our room was very clean, however the heating/ cooling was noisy and sensitive. Set to 21c it was constantly turning on and off nosily through the night. Just a niggle, enough to annoy but not enough to push anyone into one of the older hotels in town!Breakfast a great touch, again some staff were friendly, others looked down their nose at their customers. &quot;Free internet&quot; throughout the hotel shouldn't be exceptional but in Chicago it is and the Dana is to be complimented on this too.Never used the Spa, couldn't be bothered - it's prohibitively expensive compared to other hotel spa facilities and some really good day spas in town.If I had to go back to Chicago I'd stay there but only because I already know how mundane the alternative is..."
63,172,"Mar 12 2009 	Good location very modern design but I had a dark room with a small balcony	Stayed for two nights for business. I usually stay at a starwood hotel but all the hotels like the westin and the sheraton were booked. As well, this hotel was recommended by a friend in Chicago. The rate was incredible. It was half the cost of a comparable hotel.The good:Location was good as it was near many major restaurant. Off Michigan Ave, but close enough for a short walk.Rooms were comfortable and modern. Bed and bedding was comfortable. I recall free internet, and large LCD TV with sound system. Large modern washroom, but the wall between the shower and room is clear glass. Did not bother me.Service was friendly, and the general crowd was young and hip.The Bad:The room I was given had a small glass patio door. That was the only window so the room felt dark. The rooom was pretty small, but it was the darkness that was a bit of a problem. The floors are concrete, so you have to have slippers, which they provide.If I was given a better room, I would recommend. But that dark room turned me off. I would recommend if you got a different room.Had dinner one night at hotel. Restaurant was quite good. They also had a free continental breakfast which was decent.The rate was incredible. I think I paid less than $100 per night. Which is a steal for Chicago when I was there. I think it was a promotional rate.Anyhow, I have mixed feelings about the hotel. But would probably recommend if you like a trendy, modern hotel."
64,172,"Mar 3 2009 	Fabulous place especially for the cost!	I've stayed here twice now, and it has become my favorite Chicago hotel over The W and even The Peninsula. Now, if you're looking for true 5-star accomodations like The Peninsula or The Ritz, then don't stay here; it's not that kind of place. It's totally unpretentious, hip, minimalist, modern and definitely a 4-star establishment. The Staff are equally unpretentious and friendly. For Chicago, the room rates, spa prices, and the room's &quot;mini-bar/wines/snacks&quot; prices cannot be beat! If you want the best experience, get a corner room; do not get a Cozy King or any standard room with the balcony."
65,172,"Mar 2 2009 	Sheek romantic boutique hotel with breathtaking loft rooms	The best part of this hotel is the room. You walk in and you are immediately met with floor to ceiling window's for all exterior walls - looking out over the city. The room itself is all dark hardwood floors, the shower is fantastic, and the flatscreens are nice too. The rest of the hotel is nice and not too pretentious... there is a steakhouse/sushi-bar in the main level and a club at the top floor with a rooftop deck. My wife loved the spa too."
66,172,"Feb 28 2009 	Different Hotel	My friend and I stayed at this hotel prior to seeing an Oprah taping. We arrived at the lobby and was ushered up to the check out desk. Uneventful checking in.We get to our room and were a little taken back. This is a very unique hotel. Ceiling to wall windows overlooking State Street was cool.However if i have one minor complaint it would be the bathroom. The set up is rather odd- the shower overlooks the room. Yes, overlooks the room. It's like they didn't want to build a solid wall, but a glass. For what purpose? So people across the street in glass buildings can watch you take a shower if you have your ceiling to floor windows opened? It was rather odd. The ceiling appeard unfinished- just a block of concrete. I was told this was on purpose for the design.The floors are hardwood, except where the bed is located. If you use their slippers caution- mighty slippery on the hardwood floors.The breakfast in the morning was good- fresh fruit, yogurt, coffee, pastries. Excellent breakfast.The door man the next morning hailed a taxi for us. When we him where we were going he was very excited for us.Valet parking was nice. Due to our show taping later in the day, we checked out early, and they kept our luggage without question. Would I return- possibly. Just need to think outside the box of this hotel."
67,172,Feb 25 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location But Minor Flaws....	My wife and I stayed here for 4 days and enjoyed the hotel very much. We had a corner suite which was absolutely awesome. The room had 2 balconies which were small but it was 17 degrees so that didn't bother us much. The bathroom was amazing with a large walk in shower with two rain style shower heads. The bed was also extremely comfortable. The rooms were spotless and room service was spot on. The hotel is in a prime location. It's near everything. All the shopping is in walking distance as well as some great restaurants. The Chicago Art Institute (fantastic) is an $8 cab ride away as well. The Field Museum is also in the same area but we didn't care for it. The one issue with the hotel is the services provided. I don't blame the Dana necessarily as it this problem is fairly common with boutique style hotels. The gym is small however the hotel was fairly empty at the time so this wasn't an issue. Room service is severely limited. Two nights we came back to the hotel late after a few pints and its slim pickins on the menu. After 11 the only options are chips and dip and edaname. We called to see if they could make a burger or something but they couldn't. Not a total loss but a little inconvenient. My wife got a message and I told her to book before we left because of some reviews I read of people not being able to get an appointment. Well she called 3 days prior to the weekend and was only able to get something at 7pm on a Sunday and therapies were limited because the guy who was performing the message wasn't able to do what she wanted. Again...nature of the beast with a boutique hotel.Overall...it's a great hotel and would definitely recommend. These types of hotels are not for everyone though. It's a bit trendy and young.
68,172,"Feb 19 2009 	Amazing view service and lounge!!!! Read below for realistic hotel review	The arrival was a bit tricky, its VALET service, and you just need to park in front of the Hotel. BUT both the Bell Man and Concierge came out to greet us. They took our bags and immediately asked both of our names and how long we would be with them. It was very personal and comforting. The Concierge proceeded to take us to the check out on the second floor, which we were again greeted with a warm smile and friendly attitude.As we were leaving the Concierge asked where we were having dinner, and called to be sure we got &quot;primium seating&quot; as we were standing there. He then asked about lunch and again, called and made sure we received first service and premium seating. The room was AMAZING!!!! We had a corner room so that the 2 walls exposed to the City were ALL Glass WINDOWS ! Amazing view of State Street and the wonderful Church, I could even hears the bells ring that evening. As the night fell the views became more breathtaking. The bathroom was fun, and creative. Floors of the room were wood and remarkably warm for a Chicago February. The Lounge on the top floor is something you will never forget, and would have a hard time walking away from after a couple cocktails. The outside patio with exposed air to the City and again, Glass walls was something I have never experienced in Chicago.Breakfast the next morning was either Continental or we could order off a menu. I had an omlet that was to die for! I have stayed all over Chicago; The Drake, The W, The Congress (old Chicago Charm), BUT not ONE of those places could stand next to the Dana Hotel and Spa. I will stay here every single time I go to Chicago. It was amazing!!!"
69,172,"Feb 18 2009 	Pay close attention to your bill!	My sister and I were celebrating our 10th wedding anniversaries. We found the dana hotel. I thought it was a bit pricey, but my sister thought that to stay in a great downtown location we might have to pay to play. So she booked two rooms online, one for her and her hubby and one for my hubby and I. Our stay was on a Friday through Sunday. We also, booked a couples massage. After making the reservation, my sister called the next day to make sure the hotel got the resevation and to see about the spa accomadations. Well, to our surprise, the spa did not have any openings for our stay. Although the computer excepted our reservations for spa services. We asked the staff to try to fix that situation. We told the concierge that we were all celebrating our anniversary and we would like to know if the hotel did anything special for special occasions. The hotel assured us that they would do something special. Well, to make a long story short. The hotel did nothing special. We had to remind the front desk on Saturday evening that whatever the hotel was planning, that our check out was the next day. My sister told the front desk clerk that she did not drink champange and if the hotel was going to give that out, do not send that. An hour later, my sister called me in my room and told me that room service just sent them champagne and strawberries and wanted to know if we got any. Well, we did not. I called the concierge desk, and no one answered. I left a message. In the morning there was a letter along with our bill. In short the hotel appolgized that they forgot about our anniversary and gave us free breakfast in bed. They also comp one nights stay. Wow, was my reaction. I was pretty happy about that. Well, the story is not over. The next day, while I was at work my husband called me and asked what was going on with our money. He wanted me to check our bank account. I checked it and to my surprise, not only was the monies taken out for our stay but an additional $600.00 dollars was taken out. Because of that, it caused my account to be overdrawn. I of course was in shock. I called the hotel and asked to explain the charges. They could not. They said they do not have charges taken out for the $600. Over and over the Dana claimed that there could not be any such charges. I made a copy of my account and faxed it to the hotel. I had to call my bank on Monday and had them to cancel the charges. My bank did, fortunately. However,the Dana still did not own the costly mistake. When I called to talk to managment, no one was hardly ever available to talk to me about what had happened. Moreover, the bed was wonderful, the view was spectacular but the only breakfast they offered was roomservice or continental. The dinner was overpriced and not that great. The housekeeping was also a bit lousy."
70,172,"Feb 18 2009 	Great Hotel - Highly recommend to all couples!!!	We thought it was strange that no one we asked knew the name of the Dana Hotel and Spa-must be b/c it's new but we'd like to start spreading the word about how great it is. It was a fabulous hotel-very romantic and the staff was great &amp; very friendly! We enjoyed every second of our 3 night hotel stay last weekend and highly recommend it to all 30 something couples. It is very modern and trendy. The price, location and views were incredible. We'd recommend staying in the floor to ceiling rooms and ditching the balcony room b/c the panoramic view is breathtaking. The king bed and sheets were extremely comfy along with the nice large open shower. I highly recommend this hotel and will be staying again in the future."
71,172,"Feb 17 2009 	Great times and Great rates!	If you are looking for a trendy hotel that's clean and has a great location this is your place. The staff was great, the gym was workable and the lobby was fun.Great deal!"
72,172,"Feb 16 2009 	Not Worth The Hype	We came here for my birthday, and the room was tiny, with no window (just a tiny balcony off to the side) and no amenities or extras to brag about. I know they're going for minimalist design, but the room was depressing and the basics were missing. For example, we called down for aspirin when we had a headache and they &quot;didn't have any&quot;. To me that's just unacceptable- I would expect that a Motel 6 would have some aspirin for us! Some of the staff were nice, but some were a little surly. This place is not worth the price."
73,172,"Feb 15 2009	Great location. Oh so many problems.	First my wife and I booked this room through Expedia for Valentines Day and it will be the last time we use Expedia for future vacation plans. We requested a king bed but apparently our reservation could not be guaranteed and upon arrival found that the only availability were two doubles.The hotel arrangement overall is poorly executed and the elevator situation is awful. The hotel could use another 4-5 elevators. We waited on average of 3 minutes for an elevator and at one point had a 10 minute wait before deciding to take the stairs. And to use the elevator (even going down to the lobby from your room) you had to swipe your key card before pressing the button. I'm all about hotel security, but this is just overkill.At night when the hotel restaurant is in full force there is an unpleasant fish odor throughout the hotel lobby and ground level areas.As for the rooms, they are small even for Chicago standards. The bathrooms offer little in the way of privacy. I will admit having glass walls in the showers provides opportunities for &quot;fun&quot; times, but the sliding door (that never stays closed) and exterior shower curtain don't provide the proper privacy for actually USING the bathroom.To whomever designed the rooms, exposed concrete ceilings and pillars are not attractive especially when there are water/rust stains. Overall I don't recommend this hotel unless you are on a business trip alone and don't plan on staying in your room for very much time. The location is great, the hotel staff is extremely friendly, but the room quality is sub-par."
74,172,"Feb 9 2009 	Good Potential Poor Execution	We choose to stay at the Dana Hotel because of its fantastic location and my wife wanted to try their spa.First, the Spa was average to slightly above average, however pricing was higher than average. Very friendly staff, however they did not have the appropriate equipment (for example, massage for my wife was pre natal, however they did not have a pre natal table, no massage chair for pedi, etc.) If you are expecting a Canyon Ranch experience, keep looking. Second, the hotel room was OK. Nice furniture (comfortable couch and desk), and good amenities (nice bedding, reasonable wine and snacks). Housekeeping left a lot to be desired (dried toothpaste on vanity top, green mystery substance on mirror, and hair on floor and walls in bathroom). Also, you can hear every step (or other... &quot;movements&quot;) your upstairs neighbor takes. A major point of annoyance was the fact that housekeeping came at 9:05 am on the day we were checking out. We were not even awake yet! After almost falling back to sleep, there was another knock at the door, this time to restock the mini bar. Check out time is at noon! We just wanted to sleep in a bit, but it seems that the hotel staff had no intention of granting us this guilty pleasure.With so many other outstanding hotels in Chicago at this price point, we probably would not make Dana our choice again."
75,172,Feb 7 2009 	New Chicago Find!	Great new Boutique Hotel. Even with a couple startup bumps- everything was address in the approrpriate manner and overall experience far exceeded expectations!This was the perfect trip to end all business trips after a full month of traveling; am already planning a pleasure trip back. Location is excellent- great restaurants in walking distance and the concierge is outstanding and exceptionally knowledgable. Room amentities to bring the grumpiest of travelers a very big smile; room was consistently cleaned each and every day! Greeted with and welcomed back with the warmest of welcomes even on the coldest of days!! An absolute pleasure!
76,172,"Jan 29 2009 	Good Potential but not there yet...	The hotel had very nice ammenities with modern styling but was suffering startup pains. I checked in on Sunday night to find the room temperature at 46F, the thermostat was set at 72F so I called down for assistance. An engineer came up quite fast and told me that the hotel has only been open 6 months and that they have been having so many problems with the heat pumps that they don't want to fix them anymore and want the manufacturer to replace them. While he worked on the furnace I turned on the TV - the picture was un-watchable there was so much static - the engineer called the IT guy who came up quite quickly and fixed it at about the same time the engineer got the heater working. Great, minor mishap, understandable for a new hotel.I woke up at 4:30am, the room was 55F. I put on a hat and kept sleeping then got up, got ready for my conference (a conference on heating and ventilation - the irony) and called down to the front desk to request a new room as this furnace was not going to get fixed; they sent up an engineer. The engineer told me it was a building problem but I insisted that I want a new room so I packed my bags, waited for the bellhop and then moved to a higher floor room directly above the one I was in; this room was 55F too! I left for my conference and told the front desk that the second room was cold too and the heat was not working. The response was that there was a problem with the building heating and that they were working on it - ok.I came back at 6:30pm and the room was still 55F. I called down and they sent an engineer (the same guy from before). This guy was helpfull, appologized and said &quot;lets get you a different room, on the other side of the building&quot;. I packed my bags again and moved to the new room. This final room was great, the heat worked fine. I checked out the next day expecting an apology and possibly even a rebate for spending a night in a room with no heat during a bitter Chicago winter and then having to pack my bags two times to move rooms (I like my shirts crisp and re-ironed them each time I folded them up into my bag). I didn't even get asked how my stay was.Will I stay here again? Maybe in summer if the rate is low or if they can give me a money back guarantee that the HVAC will operate otherwise no."
77,172,"Jan 5 2009 	One of Chicago's best!	I recently stayed at the Dana on a business trip for a week. I was impressed with the entire experience. The general manager sent me a courtesy email after my stay . Here's exactly what I wrote back to her, which probably makes a good review:****************************Lisa-I don't often return feedback. But, your staff and the hotel was exceptional last week, far exceeding my expectations for a great experience and value.Especially good were your concierge staff. I really wish I could remember their names, but the gentleman on the AM shift and young woman on the evening shift could not have been better hosts. I've already emphatically recommended your hotel to many colleagues, and I'm looking forward to your hospitality in the future.*****************The manager sent a wonderful reply (and reminded me that the concierge staff names were Tim and Cameron!). This correspondence is indicative of the personalized service I received and I would recommend this hotel emphatically."
78,172,"Jan 1 2009 	Fabulous in every way!	We celebrated New Year's Eve at the Dana this year and it was fabulous! The suites are well appointed and the floor to ceiling windows have a fabulous view of the city. Each and every detail of the rooms is fantastic, including the shower and bath fixtures, hardwood flooring in the room, and the iPod stereo in each room.Vertigo's party in the evening had a great crowd and the shots of vodka that flowed from the &quot;V&quot; shaped ice sculptures on the heated patio overlooking the city were wonderful.Each and every staff member we came into contact with was friendly and helpful and everyone said hello to us and made us feel welcome. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of many amenities, including shopping, bars and much more.The Dana is highly recommended!"
79,172,"Dec 31 2008 	Hotel exceeded expectations spa not so much!	From the beginning of our stay, the hotel staff was very accomodating. We arrived in the pouring, cold rain and they were quick to help us unload and valet. Most staff would greet us by name when we were leaving/returning to the hotel. We were treated as though we were the only guests at the hotel. The room was very modern and hip and we had a tremendous view from our room (a panoramic view of state street). The bathroom was spa-like and the shower was wonderful (a bit of water did flow out onto the floor, but we just laid out towels). My complaint about the room: I did not find the bed/pillows to be as comfortable as other reviews had claimed. Also, we found it to be a challenge to find a comfortable temperature for the room- because of the floor to ceiling windows, there was a bit of a chill in the room, but when the heat was turned on, it instantly became HOT and very dry. (note- we did not address this with the staff, but we did notice this to be a theme among other reviews). The continental breakfast was average, very typical, which was fine with us. My biggest complaint was with the spa- which I found to be small and not as 'posh' as I had expected. Luckily, my husband and I received massages at another spa (which was terrific- exhale spa on state st). I did have a pedicure at the dana spa-- a $70 pedicure!! The woman doing my pedicure asked if I'd like additional services without telling me that there would be an extra fee, so I did not know that I was being charged an extra $30 until I went to pay. And, the pedicure was mediocre to say the least. I sat on a bench instead of a spa chair, did not receive a leg or foot massage, they do not have a foot spa, etc.We found the hotel location to be very nice- an easy walk to the mag mile and down to the state st/rush st. area."
80,172,"Dec 31 2008 	We can't wait to go back	We had the absolute pleasure of staying at the Dana Hotel on our way through Chicago. We had actually chosen this hotel based on the reviews and comments on Trip Advisor. We were impressed with every aspect of the hotel, from the booking, through to the conclusion. I had called in a few times with questions before we arrived and the people were most helpful and pleasant.When we arrived, we found it easy to get to the check in floor. The staff were excellent, very accomodating and obviously proud of the hotel. They were friendly and helpful.The room itself was just gorgeous. We have stayed in many four and five star hotels. This ranked up there as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. The bed was amazing. The bathroom made us want to redecorate ours. The shower was just fabulous. I think I took two showers the first night just to have showers! The amenties were very well thought out. It was a bit disconcerting to have the floor to ceiling windows at first. We certainly got used to it. I found the view amazing. We could see the &quot;Chicago&quot;sign out the window. I have to mention the food from Aja Steak. Oh My God. The best steak I have ever had! We had room service the first night and just wanted to chill out. The food was just to die for.The continenal breakfast the next morning was very nice. Lots of fresh fruit, bagels or muffins. It was more than just a &quot;throw in&quot; breakfast.I have to mention Tim the main conceierge. He was just so wonderful. So helpful with suggestions. Part of the way through the day after buying out most of Hawkshop (and seeing Bill Murray there) we had too many bags to carry around with us. I called Tim and asked about delivery service. He came over in a cab and collected our bags and took them back to the hotel. As well, unfortunately my 10 year old son lost his camera in the back of a cab. Tim and the front desk staff helped us in trying to locate it. Tim was just fantastic. He was able to get our camera back to us in Canada. The best conceierge we have ever seen.We were just so sad to leave. We cant wait to go back. There is no other place we would consider staying in Chicago."
81,172,"Dec 25 2008 	extremely noisie room heater	The design of this hotel is very modern with huge windows replacing all the walls. Unfortunately, those huge glass windows are not good for installation . The room equipped with individual heater that is extremely noise which kept me awake through the entire night. It may be good to stay in this hotel when weather is nice but not for the winter time!"
82,172,"Dec 14 2008 	Great little hotel	I have been to Chicago a few times and new the area i wanted to stay it. I cam across the Dana Hotel on tripadvisor - checked it on a number of other sites and got a GREAT price on in - so i decided to try it.What a fantastic find.the location is fantastic, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was great. I had a balcony room - because i am a smoker. It wasnt a large but more than sufficient. The stand out is the shower.the bar on the top floor is great fro late 20's/early 30's.breakfast is continental - which is a bit thin, and i did have some food from the restaurant, which was very goodoverall - a really great place - definitely somewhere i will return to"
83,172,"Dec 9 2008 	Not quite 100% yet	A new hotel, billing itself as &quot;cool, small boutique&quot; which about sums it up. Maybe too cool in terms of the visitors who come for the restaurant and bar, but the staff were incredibly friendly. I was in a corner room - with floor to celing windows on two sides the room tended to be cold (the concrete, noncarpted floor excruciatingly so) and it took some time to close all of the blinds in order to change (to be fair, the staff will do this as part of turn down service at night). Very comfortable bed, reasonable workout facility (1 eliptical, 1 bike, 1 treadmill and one lateral motion trainer) as well as some free weights and a new-ish Italian machine designed for core strength building. Small, but perfectly adequate and not well used when I was there. Plus, having a tv on each piece of cardio is always a nice plus. When i was there, they had not yet sorted out cable service to the rooms - so there were no movies on demand and only a handful of channels. I'm sure by now that's sorted. Nice enough amenities and a full suite of them. Steam room available in the fitness/spa floor locker rooms. Nice complimentary breakfast - more than the usual US contintental scheme. Overall tends to be quite a good value and in a very practical part of town for business as well as vacationing."
84,172,"Dec 7 2008 	Modern Luxury at the Dana	My boyfriend and I stayed here on a Friday night. We requested an upper level room and were promptly placed in a corner room on the 20th floor. Our room had two walls of windows and a spectacular view. The view alone justifies the price. In addition to the view, however, the Dana room contained the single most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in--imported linens, king-sized bed, fluffy down comforter, a mountain of pillows. It is strange entering the hotel through the bottom floor restaurant, but a friendly host quickly directed us upstairs to the lobby. We also checked out Vertigo, the lounge on the top floor, but it was packed at 11:30 on a Friday night, so we opted for the quiet of our room instead. The shower is big enough for several adults and the water pressure is great. The set-up is a little strange--with just one night there, we weren't able to master showering without soaking the rest of the bathroom, as the shower does not have a door that closes, but it's still quite nice. There is only a curtain over a glass wall blocking the view of the shower/bathroom from the rest of the room, but it wasn't an issue for us. The continental breakfast Saturday morning was impressive, as far as continental breakfasts go. There was a large room service menu available at all times of day, but we did not try it. We took breakfast back to our room and made mimosas. Overall, the staff was friendly and competent, the ambiance was great, the furnishings were modern but comfortable, and all of that, in such a prime location, close to so much activity downtown, simply can't be beat."
85,172,"Dec 1 2008 	Nice Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Dana for a Friday and Saturday night in November. We traveled to Chicago for a long weekend get away, and were looking forward to relaxation. We'll start by saying that we enjoyed many aspects of the hotel, though had a few minor issues. We checked in on Friday and requested an upper level room, hoping for nice views. We were placed on the 24th (of 26) floor, in a nicely appointed room. The bed was quite comfortable, had a plush down comforter and down pillows. The i-pod speaker system was very convenient, and definitely was a nice addition. The shower was big enough for two adults, and the bathroom as a whole was very nice. Friday night, both my husband and I were quite tired after a long work week, and wanted to rest and go to bed early. At approximately 9 pm, we began hearing rather loud, thumping bass music. We waited several hours, attempting to determine where the sound was coming from?! At 11 pm, the bass continued to be quite loud and slightly disrupting when attempting to fall asleep. My husband called down to the front desk reporting the noise and was advised they would further investigate. At 11:30, the same music continued, and we called down to the front desk again. Finally, at 12:15, my husband went in search of where the sound was coming from. At that point, he realized there was a night club on the 26th (top) floor, with music that could be heard several floors down. He requested a room transfer, and we moved (at 1 am) to the 12th floor, where it was thankfully quiet. The hotel did give us a complimentary bottle of wine, which was a nice compensation. Saturday night, many night club patrons were also in the hotel elevators, and the music was again noted to be loud on the upper floors. So, a suggestion may be to avoid the upper level rooms if you are a light sleeper, or want a quiet room atmosphere. Overall, we enjoyed the room, but personally felt like old-fogeys (we are in our early 30's?), in the trendy, chic atmosphere of the hotel."
86,172,"Nov 16 2008 	Lovely Boutique hotel	The hotel is quietly tucked on a corner in a great location. Cab drivers had a hard time finding it, you won't find a lit marquee or a porte-cochere but a doorman will happily hold the door for you and make sure your bags get to your room. the restaurant is on the ground floor and depending on how you go up one floor you may be a litte confused. The reception desk is just a desk wih a couple of monitors and phones on it. It is different but it works.  We had a corner room, 2 walls were floor to ceiling windows, there were black out shades and sheer shades available. In the bathroom, the level of privacy is entirely up to the person left in the room....the shower stall has a glass wall that looks into the bedroom and on to the toilet....there is a curtain but it is on the room side. Enough said.The room had a large plasma tv and speaker system for the ipod as well as free internet. the bedding was very comfortable, down pillows overall very nice.The continental breakfast offered bagels, cereal, coffee, juice and fresh fruit. Only drawback were the sirens, there is a firehouse or hospital nearby and they were very active through the night when we were there. I do believe we would go back again."
87,172,"Nov 9 2008 	A great experience	I had a wonderful stay at the Dana Hotel. I can't speak to the size of the standard rooms because I received a complimentary upgrade to a suite upon our arrival. However, I think I would have enjoyed the hotel (almost) as much if I hadn't. The location of the hotel was excellent. Additionally, as a wine lover, the selections offered in the mini bar were the best that I have ever experienced. The staff was very nice and friendly and the complementary breakfast was a great extra."
88,172,Nov 6 2008 	Loved the Dana!	We stayed at the Dana for 3 nights Oct. 24th - 27th and found it to be an excellent location as well as a fun and friendly place to stay. We booked the Fall Dining Package for 1 night and it was a great deal. Dinner in AjaSteak was very good and we enjoyed the atmosphere. It also included &quot;breakfast in bed&quot; which was very enjoyable. We also had the opportunity to see 3 different rooms and must admit - they were all great. The corner room with 2 &quot;walls&quot; of ceiling to floor windows was amazing although we did not stay in it. We had a suite with one of the best showers (for 2) that we have seen in a hotel in this price range. The room was very comfortable and we loved it. The other nice advantage is that the wines (full bottles) and snacks in the room are very reasonably priced which is a nice switch from other hotels. We also loved the contemporary look of the hotel while still having a warm and inviting feel. We had drinks upstairs at Vertigo the rooftop bar. Our experience on a Sat. night was that they had a seperate entrance outside for non-guests and people were lined up to get in but they did not come inside the hotel to get there. When we returned to the hotel in the evening there was someone standing by the elevators checking to make sure we were hotel guests before we could go in so we did not have any issues going back to our room.All the employees were very pleasant and we have already recommended this hotel to others.
89,172,"Nov 3 2008 	What a pleasant surprise...	I was looking for a place to do interviews in downtown Chicago and stumbled upon the Dana on the internet. I booked it because of the price, location, and thought that it might be more interesting than the major chains where I usually stay. I was right. My avg. per night price was approx. $210.It's a boutique hotel, very hip, with a friendly staff who was there to help but was not intrusive or overly cheery. My room was on the 22nd floor on the corner, with a great view down State St. and the Chicago theater. The living room part had two walls of floor to ceiling windows, a flat screen tv in the corner, and a fully stocked wine/beverage fridge. As a lover of wine I really appreciated this! They also had teas, coffees and some terrific little snacks, all at reasonable prices.The bedroom was separated from the living space by sliding Japanese type doors. The bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom was wonderful. One wall of the shower is glass so if you are there with your honey you could have some fun :-). The rain shower head was amazing after a long flight to the city, and the toiletries were top notch.If you can, try the restaurant. I had the lettuce wedge salad and sea bass entree. Both were great. And the bistro across the street is handy and has terrific ambiance and food.All in all would recommend to anyone except those turned off by ultra-modern decor. I'll definitely stay again when in the area!"
90,172,"Oct 30 2008	Good concept that does not work	Fist let me say what is great about the Dana Hotel-its location. It is a block from Starbucks, Trader Joes, Dues Pizza, movie theaters, and just about everything else. The neighborhood is called Northbridge and it is jumping! One great place a block away is a Champaign Bar which is the epitome of chic!! I wanted to go there because I like Champaign but it was always packed. One night I spotted an empty seat at the bar and landed it. They have a large selection of Champaign by the glass ranging in price from $18-$22. I had two glasses and it was great. I highly recommend this place. There is also an upscale frozen yogurt place directly across the street from the hotel selling avant-garde frozen yogurt where a large one will cost you $10. This place is open until 2am on weekends. And immediately across the street from the Dana is an upscale restaurant which serves dinner until 4am. I tested this out and it is true- I went in at 3 am and got a great fillet minion dinner and the place was packed. People were still coming in at 3:30 am!Now the downside of the hotel. It is a new hotel and they advertise that the rooms have one wall which is literally floor to ceiling glass and great views of the city. Well my room (which was rather small) had the wall of glass directly across a narrow street from a building of condominiums. So the view I had from my glass wall was directly into the living quarters of about 20 people, and vice versa. It was so bad that at night I would walk around my room with the lights off in my nighties and when someone across the street turned on their kitchen light it would light up my room and I would have to grab a sheet and cover myself up. For any privacy you practically have to put the shades down when you are in the room and that makes it just another very small dark room. Another problem I found with the Dana is that they have a bar on the roof and the access to it is through the same elevators that go to the rooms. I came home one evening and the hotel had a hawker on the street in front of hotel promoting the bar and drawing crowds from the street the hotel. It became quite crowded on the first floor and I had to wait in line to get to the elevator and then went up it with people pulled off the street. It was not a pleasant experience. When looking for a hotel in Chicago the Dana was the lowest priced 4 star hotel at $172 while competing hotels were in the $300 range. I would say that for the price the Dana is a deal and worth choosing. At a higher price I would think twice about staying there."
91,172,"Oct 28 2008 	Perfect Hotel in Chicago!	What a great property. It's my new favorite hotel in Chicago. Very hip and modern without being pretencious. The staff is just plain nice - and not robot nice - really nice. When we arrived the doorman welcomed us, asked the name of the reservation, and when we arrived at the &quot;front desk&quot; about 2 minutes later we were welcomed by name!!!My fomer favorite was the Sofitel just a couple of blocks away - . This is just as nice, staff even nicer and much less expensive. There is a very cool &quot;lobby&quot; bar with a huge fireplace - great for a chilly Chicago night. Great location on N. State Street in the Gold Coast neighborhood. As a Chicgao native - this hotel represents the real Chicago - young, hip. nice, and affordable!"
92,172,"Oct 28 2008 	I will return to the DANA HOTEL and SPA!	My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Dana Hotel. It was recommended to me by a colleague's friend who lives in Chicago and it was my first time to Chicago. From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left we were treated as if we were the only guests staying there. It's obvious they pride themselves in customer service and anything we needed (like toothpaste!!) was taken care of quickly. The door men, bell hops, and even the hotess for the restaurant downstairs would hold conversations with us opon entering and exiting the building. They were very knowledgeable of the area and recommended great places to eat, sight see, and go out at night. The hotel is located very close to Mag Mile... We walked there and back, I think it's only 4 blocks? It's also located in a great area near alot of restaurants and places to go out. We stayed in a &quot;Serene King&quot; and it was amazing. We had a corner room with floor to ceiling windows and the view was great. We never felt like we were staying in a hotel, but rather a really nice upscale condo. Everything in the room was modern including the shower which you can view from the bed or pull the curtain for privacy. My favorite part was the shower head that was literally above my head... very relaxing! The bed was very comfortable with an overstuffed comforter. The room was very romantic without trying too hard.  Both nights we stayed at the Dana we went to their &quot;Vertigo Lounge&quot; either before we went out or to close out the evening. The music was very chill and relaxing, but put you in the dancing mood and the seating was pretty comfortable. More like you were sitting in a nice living room with a great view, and very dim lights. We didn't go out onto the &quot;outside patio&quot; because it was just a little too cold outside. We walked down and checked out the Spa... it looks really nice. We didn't have anything done, but we promised that when we return we definitely will! They also had a nice workout area with equipment I've never seen lol! We also didn't get a chance to eat at their restaurant, but both nights they seemed pretty busy. All and all, my boyfriend and I LOVED the Dana Hotel and enjoyed our stay. We recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. We plan on returning early 2009. I hope this helps your future traveling to Chicago! :)"
93,172,"Oct 21 2008 	Best hotel in town	Excellent hidden hotel especially for couples, best comfortable bedding with lots ofpillows, very modern room, the best shower in the whole world.Very clean room and bathroom"
94,172,"Oct 15 2008 	Quirky Hotel	The Dana was very quirky. Mostly in a good way, but in some bad. Some background: my friend and I are college-aged and stayed there for some interviews. We never really felt like the staff recognized us as guests--nobody was ever opening the front door for us and one night they almost didn't let us upstairs (a weekend night) because we both didn't have room keys.Upon arrival, you have to take an elevator to the lobby from the ground floor. It got to be a bit annoying walking up/down the stairs every time, but that's just me and nothing worth complaining about, but something of note. The check-in was pretty seamless, and we got our room (a cozy king), which was the perfect size for us. The room was very nice--nice bed, nice tv, beautiful bathroom, balcony. It was smaller than most 4-star rooms, but didn't have an exorbitant price to match, and had a perfect location nearby the magnificent mile and trains (though nearby food left something to be desired). Be careful though--the wood floors can be slippery! Turn down service was chocolate covered fortune cookies--very nice!All in all, I would stay at this hotel again. It seems bizarre that this is a pretty hip hotel that didn't really cater to that crowd, but more to the businessman/retired couple category."
95,172,"Oct 9 2008 	First-time Boutique Hotel stay	We were in Chicago for a friend's 60th birthday and had selected the Dana for its location (it also was part of the air/hotel package through Expedia). Have to say that we had never stayed at a &quot;Boutique Hotel&quot; before and found the whole experience wonderful! The staff was excellent and very attentive in a sincere way. When we got to our room, the Heating/Cooling register did not work properly. A quick phone call downstairs and the register was adjusted from a remote location. The hotel is located on the Red line of the CTA. It is two blocks from the Mag Mile. We loved the location. We did not eat at the restaurant (AjaSteak) but had a very nice continental breakfast one of our mornings there (included fresh fruit, cereals, coffee, fruit juices, oatmeal, yogurt, bagels and pastry) all for free.The staff remembered our names and would great us personally in the lobby when we saw them. Overall an excellent experience."
96,172,"Sep 24 2008 	2 Thumbs up from a seasoned (and cynical) traveller!	I stayed at the Dana on business, Sept. 17 through 19. I travel quite a lot for business (1-2 trips per month) - and have become resigned to having low expectations - no bed bugs and no mold seem like 4 star luxury.But I have to say that I was so blown away by the service, the room, the comfort at the Dana. Sure, it is a new hotel, and they are still working on the kinks...I had my &quot;new&quot; bedside tables delivered after my first night. But, that all is trivial. The bed was so comfortable, the room was fantastic. I also have to add, that I got a courtesy upgrade to a nirvana suite - what a pleasant surprise and a beautiful room. But for me, the staff and comfort made my stay. And the continental breakfast in the lounge was a pleasant (and tasty) surprise. Very european - not what you usually find in the US.I'm surprised by the reviews that list the staff as rude or unfriendly. That certainly was not my experience at all....all were very pleasant, kind and attentive to me - from check-in, room service, concierge, housekeeping and doorman. I interacted with them all and they all made me feel welcome and at home.The Dana is now the only place I'll stay in Chicago. And that's a first for me. Usually, I'll take the cheapest good enough thing I can find on priceline. But the Dana - it will be worth the extra costs, as I'm sure when this gem gets discovered, it will get pricier!So - If you are a traveller that knows how to travel (be polite, have reasonable expectations) - then you will adore this place. Remember -it just opened, so expect some kinks."
97,172,"Sep 22 2008 	Great hotel Great Locationl	My overall experience was great! The staff was more than helpful. We stayed in a Serene King room. The rooms were average size for a king hotel room. The beds were excellent. The bathroom was on the small size but the shower was larger than a hotel shower and very unique. The bathroom was open to the bedroom but there was a nice curtain to cover the window. The view was of an office building but there were large floor to celing windows that I really liked. We only had a drink in the bar-on the first floor (kinda weird you walk into the restarurant) it was OK. The Dana is in walking distance from many great bars and resturants. I booked online and got a &quot;weekend package&quot; which included parking which is usually $40+ a night and a $50 dollar fuel card, which paid for all of my gas to get to chicago and back. The room only came out to being $303. If I could get a deal like this again I will be back! It was a great experience"
98,172,"Sep 19 2008 	completely ridiculous!	Stayed in a serenity suite this time around at a lower price due to a poor experience previously at the Dana. I wanted to give them one last shot before I wrote them off completely. Can I just say, putting someone in a handicap accessible suite when the guests are so obviously not handicapped is ridiculous. Secondly, the pictures are 800% doctored on their website to look more glorious than the rooms actually look. The website shows stone seating in the shower area. Our bathroom did not include this luxury. The website also shows a privacy curtain up on the window dividing bedroom and living area. The room did not have this curtain. What our room DID have was a lot of broken lighting fixtures, PAINTERS TAPE EVERYWHERE, yes we're talking bright blue tape on various walls throughout the room. Also included at no cost was the abandoned LUNCH COOLER on our balcony outside. This room would normally cost upward of $500 a night. Do you not AT LEAST do a run thru before putting guests in the room? Professional this place is not. When we called down to the front desk to discuss the issues, we were greeted with blatant rudeness. &quot;Well, I see you had a problem with your stay last time, what is it THIS time?.. If you would like we can downgrade you into a normal room.&quot;My friend and I have never been talked to SO condescendingly. Surely we will not be coming back. Ever. I'm sure the Trump would provide a higher level of service without the obvious snobbery and carelessness. On a positive note, there is a complimentary breakfast downstairs on the main floor and it was a pretty nice spread. Delicious granola, fruit, bagels, etc. But I didn't pay hundreds of dollars for bagels, did I?"
99,172,Sep 15 2008 	Blah Blah DANA	Far from the best. Ok here's our feel the room layout was poor leaving the rooms with a corporate feel. The unpainted ceilings didn't fit. The showers are nice unless you've already got a nice one at home. The there is the poor lighting in the entire room. Sheets and bedding far from a W type quality end all we won't be back and urge you to head down the street elswhere.
100,172,"Sep 15 2008 	Great stay at the Dana	My wife &amp; I recently stayed at the Dana Hotel &amp; Spa on 9-12 thru 9-14 and had a fantastic experience. I was in Chicago for a convention and it was also our anniversary. We were able to check in early on Friday so I could go to the convention and my wife could go shopping. We were upgraded to a Serenity suite and it was fantastic. Corner room with a balcony off the living room and off the bedroom. Beautiful wood floors, 2 37&quot; flat panels t.v's and the biggest 2 person shower I have ever seen. Bed was very comfortable with glass wall separating living room from bedroom. Sleek &amp; modern, but very cozy. Wine cooler, snacks, robes, slippers, etc. Had drinks and sushi at AJASteak.Very cool. Tried other restaurants in Chicago for dinner. Complimentary continental breakfast each morning. Service was impeccable!! Very genuine and caring without &quot;having there palm out&quot; all the time. Can't wait to go back and try the spa and Vertigo lounge when it opens. We have traveled all over the country and it definetly makes our top 5. Go to the Dana."
101,172,"Sep 2 2008 	Super Chic	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel over Labor Day weekend for 3 nights and had a absolutely wonderful stay. We stayed in one of the serene king rooms with all the windows and lucked out by getting a corner room! We had two full walls of windows with a fabulous view of downtown and Trump Tower. The bed and linens were super comfortable and we definitely were a little sluggish to get out of bed in the morning. There was complimentary breakfast downstairs in the morning, which from my research on Chicago hotels was a rareity. I really can't say enough good things. I wish the rooftop bar had been open, but it was still under construction and won't open for another 2 weeks.We had dinner at Aja one night which was not inexpensive but definitely delicious. Our server was fabulous, like every other staff person at the hotel. We just took our time while we sat on the patio and enjoyed the ambiance. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I am sure we will be staying there again on our next trip!"
102,172,"Aug 30 2008 	Shhh! It's still a secret	Be sure that small and ultra modern is your taste. If it is, go directly here. We stayed in room 1015 which is a called a &quot;cozy king&quot;. This was a corner room. It had both windows and a tiny balcony, king bed, desk area, two low stools and a table, mini bar, closet and bath. Yes, the drapes to the waterfall shower are controlled on the room side...didn't bother me. Nice TV, phones and sound system. Very clean and tranquil. No noise at all when we stayed. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. The Dana it is located in a nice and convenient area. I booked directly with the hotel because they had the best deals about 6 days before our stay. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago. We didn't have our kids (8 and 9) with us, but they would have been comfortable here in a larger room.One of the few criticisms I have is that you must walk into the restaurant on the ground floor to get to your room. Though there is an elevator behind the restaurant reception area and stairs directly inside from the street entrace, there should be a separate entrance to the second floor hotel lobby. I really liked this hotel and wish I could have stayed longer than two days."
103,172,"Aug 29 2008 	wonderful hotel!!	My husband and I stayed here after reading some positive reivews online and we were not disappointed. The staff without exception was fabulous--friendly and helpful. The room from the bedding to the view to the beverages and snacks offered were unusally good. Wonderful comfy robes were in the room with slippers and the bottles of wine offered in the room (for a reasonable price!) were really good--and we are fairly fussy too. The room was quiet and decorated like the W Hotel and our view was great. It did remind me of the W Hotel, but more of a smaller boutique hotel. The location can't be beat either. we will definitely go back!"
104,172,"Aug 19 2008 	loved the dana	o.k, where do i start?? This hotel is grand. I am a world traveller-mostly for work. and i have to say, that this hotel surpasses my expectation. i had a great stay. The staff was amaaaziiing.You have to see for yourself.You have to ask to meet Kennedy. The most profesional and charming guy, i have ever met. The dana definitely made the best choice hiring that guy.His just simply 5 star. did i also mention, his style! My family cant stop talking about their experience there. Try the spa.its luxury. I promised my family we could stay there every year. Great Job guys."
105,172,"Aug 12 2008 	Great stay at the Dana	My husband and I stayed at the Dana for four nights. We loved our time in Chicago and most of the things about our stay at the Dana.The location is AWESOME. You are 3 blocks from the Mag Mile, 3 blocks from the North River gallery district, 20 minute walk to Milennium Park and the Art Institute, 10 minutes from the Merchandise Mart, 1 minute from Whole Foods, lots of public transit options.The rooms are modern and nicely furnished, though on the small side. The beds are fantastic - large and comfortable with great linens. The shower is also amazing with great showerheads (i want to get one for my house!) but it is also VERY close to the bed, with a glass wall and a curtain controlled by the person outside of the bathroom. I found this strange, particulary since you can see the whole bathroom through that wall. (I dont know about you, but I like to do my business in private)The staff is very friendly, and if we needed anything they were very accomodating. However, I like to go in and out kinda quietly and I found their inquires a tad much - I think we got asked how our stay was going at least 7 times the first day. Which isnt a bad thing necessarily, just depends on your preference.One last complaint - the hotel was noisy. I dont mind the city noise or the traffic, but the noise inside the hotel was grating. Perhaps it was poor luck that we stayed next to a couple of yahoos who loved to play their loud bass music at 1am and go in and out of their rooms 18 times an hour, but something about the hotel doesnt seem to cushion the noise well. You can hear a door closing from down the hall (those doors are [--] loud!).I dont want to end on a bad note because I really did have a good time. They leave you cookies each night. The bathrobes and slippers are very nice. The coffee (Green Mountain) is free and good quality and is ready in about 3 minutes. It's a good place to stay, but I wouldnt spend $300 a night to stay there. (Here is a tip: I found a good rate on travelocity but then called the hotel and they gave me their best rate guarantee discount of 10%, so we ended up staying for $170 a night which was well worth it)."
106,172,"Jul 31 2008 	A Terrific Experience	Our stay at the Dana was wonderful. We spent the night to celebrate our anniversary this summer. Living in the Chicago, suburbs, we are familiar with downtown and watched the progress of the Dana this spring. The service was excellent ... friendly, professional, accomodating. The room was gorgeous ... very modern with cement ceilings and great furnishings and linens. The location is perfect (in our opinion) ... a few blocks away from the chaos of shopping on the Magnificent Mile, but close enough to walk over any time that we wanted; close to excellent resaurants and bars. We've stayed at all of the four/five star properties in the city and would recommend this hotel with those ... at a fraction of the price. We will definitely book this property again. (Note: I wish that they had pictures of the rooms on the website. They are worth seeing.)"
107,172,"Jul 25 2008 	5 stars for the Dana Hotel 	I spent last weekend at the Dana Hotel &amp; Spa with my mom and sisters for a glorious birthday weekend. The rooms were immaculate and the staff was impeccable. Being that it was a new hotel, I wasn't sure if they would have everything in tip top shape but I have to say, I was incredibly impressed. We used many amenities at the hotel including the work out room, spa and restaurant. The spa was a last minute decision because it was raining out and we opted to stay in. We had facials and massages and all were absolutely luxurious. We felt like we were staying at a five star hotel. If you stay there, make sure to try the Mr. Kites candy that they keep in the room in case you are hungry. MMMMM delicious and NOT overpriced for minibar food! Oh and the pillows were so soft and fluffy!! Look out, you may not want to leave your bed!! We can't wait to come back for birthday weekend again next year!"
108,172,"Jul 21 2008 	New Chicago Hot Spot	We live in Chicago, but wanted to stay downtown for our 5-year anniversary. My wife found this hotel while searching online. I walked over at lunch and received a full tour of the rooms and spa from the Sales Manager. This is a brand new hotel that opened a month ago, and is still in the midst of being finished. It is very modern and has some neat amenities in the room. It is a great location for the out of towners who are looking to shop and do the touristy activities.From the moment we arrived through the time we left, we were treated like king and queen. Patrick the bellhop took care of us the second we walked out of the car. We needed to leave the car downstairs as we checked in (no problem). We were give a corner room, number 812 that had a balcony facing north and ceiling to floor windows. The rooms have a modern feel and from what I understand our built form recycled material, including wood floors etc... There is a shower that get this, actually has great water pressure and a window that allows you to watch TV :). The bed was super comfy and the blackout shades allowed us to sleep in!We did not have a chance to visit the bar or restaurant as we had other plans, but it was hopping when we came back at midnight. My guess is that the locals are going to start making this a hot spot. We also did not go to the spa, although it looked pretty nice when I toured it (a lot of tile and things made form recycled materials).For $250, the value was supreme and the service was impeccable. I would highly recommend this to anyone coming to town, even for business!"
109,172,"Jul 19 2008 	Great rooms - but paint fumes a dealbreaker	3.0 rating reflects very mixed experience - some aspects qualify for a 5.0, but paint fumes in fact made it a 1.0.Pros: Great location; extremely helpful and friendly staff; free wi-fi; rooms beautifully appointed with exciting design details and amazing picture window views (some with balconies); good coffee maker in room with complimentary coffee and tea; great bath products.Cons: Some of the exciting design details tried too hard and didn't work that well in practice; poor sound-proofing both to hallway and street. Biggest problem at the time of our visit was that the hotel is so spanking new (about 1 month old) that the chemical fumes from paint, carpets, furniture etc. were overwhelming and caused us to check out prematurely after just the first night. Expect the fumes problem will be solved in time, although with A/C as only source of air circulation, it may take a while. Once the air clears, this hotel should be a great choice if you're looking for modern, chic cool."

2,176,Nov 13 2009 	Awesome view and location	Moms and Daughters weekend...city view is great! 4 out of the 6 of us had never been to Chicago and they loved the view. A few blocks from the Magnificent Mile and great restaurants all around. Was able to leave our car in the garage until 3pm of the day we checked out which was a great help in not having to repark and pay a daily parking rate. You can't beat the breakfast!
3,176,"Nov 11 2009 	Good Downtown Location/Friendly Staff	This is a great hotel if you are going to be in the downtown area and don't mind walking a bit. You can always take a cab, but Chicago is a great walking city if you are able to do so. The hotel is also in walking distance to Michigan Ave. shopping and restaurants. The Red Line is a couple of blocks away which makes it ideal to ride the train up to Lincoln Park and Wrigleyville. The room was quite nice and spacious. Upon moving to Chicago from Texas, I stayed in this particular hotel for a week before moving into an apartment. The hotel staff were very helpful in giving me directions and suggestions. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. The rooms are much bigger than most hotels in the area, and the price is pretty reasonable. Further, free breakfast and happy hour are great bonuses."
4,176,Nov 3 2009 	Very nice hotel with a fantastic free breakfast buffet.	This was a very nice hotel. It has a separate bedroom area and a microwave and coffee maker. It had free drinks and snacks in the evening and a fantastic breakfast buffet in the morning. This hotel is well situated to the attractions of the city. We were very happy with our stay there.
5,176,"Oct 26 2009 	What a let down!	My family and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for a long weekend. It was located within a mile of michigan ave. so great for shopping but we would definately look to stay somewhere else the next time we go to Chicago.The managers reception was really disappointing. Spinach dip and stale pita bread.The breakfast in the morning was a real bummer as well. The eggs were cold and the french toast soggy. The pull out bed was broken. I called to the front desk 2 different times, after a half hour wait I finally got fed up and went down to the front desk. They gave us a different room. Nothing like having to move all your stuff at 11:00 at night. The pull out bed in the new room worked but you could feel the springs in the mattress. My daughter woke up with a sore back the next morning. Overall, a very disappointing stay. We will definately be looking to stay somewhere else the next time we visit the windy city!!"
6,176,"Oct 24 2009 	Clean comfortable and easy access to places.	I love the suite because you get the additional room. TVs in both the living room and bedroom, not that we used them so much, but nice to have. The complimentary buffet makes the morning so easy. The food was good and there was a good variety. The doorman and concierge were great help!"
7,176,"Oct 14 2009 	A Great Friendly Hotel	I arrived at the Embassy Suites just in time for the 4th of July festivities. My daughter (spoiled due to excess hotel stays) was actually impressed with the layout and cleanliness of the hotel. We were invited to the Manager's reception each evening for free cocktails and snacks. A nice touch!! The concierge was also exceptional. We were constantly asking questions and he was always friendly and helpful. We checked out and stayed at the Hyatt Regency for the last two days of our trip. My daughter said, although it was luxurious, it was super busy and impersonal. Next time I stay in Chicago, I'm staying at the Embassy Suites."
8,176,"Oct 8 2009 	A greatlocation with convenient amenities	Wve've stayed here several times because of the value, convenience, and wonderful breakfast. You can walk everywhere. Great restaurants are right around the corner. The rooms are a bit dated, but the extra space to spread out is appreciated after a long day. The Managers cocktail reception in the evening is also an added bonus. Can's say enough about it..."
9,176,"Oct 6 2009 	Great Hotel will go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	My hubby and i stayed at hotel wed 9/30-10/4/9. We absolutely enjoyed a=our stay. my hubby had a business meeting, I went to shop and sight see. I don't know where to start. The room was great no complaints great comfy bed ( to be a hotel). Granite countertops in bathroom they tried to make it feel like home I guess you could say. Hubby say meeting rooms adaquate. Business center was great especially if you did not buy the internet in your room (which we did which is 9.95 plus they tax that) The front desk staff was very nice with smiling faces everytime you went down always willing to help.The conciege, Phillip is the best. He told me everything I wanted to know. Go on the Chicago Trolley for a tour one day or three. I went three. It was awsome. You hop on and off as you wish. You just have to get back on by 5pm or you can take a taxi which can get really expensive. Did not take the el which is the train or any buses. Paid for a taxi so we could get there. Hold on the taxi people drive fast. You will also hear a lot of horn blowing. I met Richard once, hes's nice too. Navy pier does a fre trolley to the pier on Fri, sat, and sun. Don't really drink but they had free drinks from 530-730pm. they made me a sex in the beach and it tasted like koolaid. Also they give you snacks to like pretzals, spinach dip and crackers,and cheese. Don't look for this to get you full it's a nice evening snack. I read previous reviews and i think people were trying to get full and that not what it's for. There is a great hotdog place called Portillos one block over. THIS IS A MUST. There is a rain forest cafe, hard rock cafe, Mcdonalds, ESPN, all one block over. Overall the hotel is great. The next time I go to Chicago will differnlt stay here. Mag mile as the call it (magnifient mile) is 3 blocks. You can walk, have plenty of money to shop. No complaints."
10,176,"Oct 5 2009 	Good Hotel Value?? Parking??	I usually stay at the Hilton by Grant Park. This hotel is more expensive, north of the river, a few blocks off of Michigan Avenue. Plenty of eating options in the area. I usually pay $40 less to stay at the Hilton, and the parking is $40 at either place. Rooms are clean and quiet. Free breakfeast is a plus."
11,176,"Oct 1 2009 	Enjoyable Stay	I stayed at the Embassy Suites for 3 nights and found the Hotel excellent. The Rooms or Suites clean and a good size. The bathroom was on the average size and there wasn't an extractor fan, which was needed.The service was friendly and the concierge was first class.An Ideal location to view and explore Chicago.Included in your stay is a fine breakfast, you can have an omelette freshly made and other food available. Then in the evening between 5:30- 7pm a free bar I hope one day to return to Chicago and would be more than happy to stay here."
12,176,"Sep 26 2009 	great choice for a central place to stay	We spent a week at this hotel while on a sightseeing trip to Chicago from the west coast. It was the perfect spot. The staff was helpful from the beginning. Richard, the concierge, gave us tips of things to see and directions for how to get around. He helped us get tickets to the House of Blues Sunday brunch- a super experience! Three senior citizens who travel together frequently couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. Thank you Embassy Suites. Barb from Seattle"
13,176,"Sep 24 2009 	Decent - but not WOWSA!	I stayed here earlier this week for business. We got a great group rate - otherwise I would not have paid close to $300 for a hotel per night. That's just me.ALL of my telephone conversations with the hotel were FANTASTIC. I called a couple of days prior to make some special requests, including an early check in. When I got to the front desk - early - they indicated the room they had reserved for me was not yet available, but he found one that was and offered to have my special requests (extra pillows) brought up to the room. I hadn't been in the room 5 minutes before they arrived. FANTASTIC.I left shortly therafter, stopping at the concierge to ask about going to the aquarium. Yeah, he was a little too busy to deal with me and did not give me any advice other than to say take the bus. I opted for a cab - and the cabbie REALLY didn't want to deal with traffic from the football game - and told me that it would probably take 45 mintues to get to the aquarium that day. Would have been nice if the concierge had filled me in on that tidbit. So I took a $6 cab ride to the Navy Pier (which I could have gotten a shuttle for free - about a block away from the hotel).When I got back to the hotel, I walked around a couple of blocks. A single woman on a Sunday late afternoon, I felt safe. The hotel is right in the thick of things, so there was plenty to catch my attention. I ate dinner and headed back to the hotel, exhausted from flying and the time difference.I grabbed a glass of wine at the reception. I'm not a huge drinker, so this was not a deal breaker for me. As others have said, it's nice, but the nibbles were ptretzels and maybe honeydew melon? Most all of it was gone when I got there (about 6:30 p.m.). Back to the room which was nice and clean. The couch in the sitting room wasn't all that great, so I opted to watch TV on the bed. That's when the flat screen would have been nicer in the bedroom (it was in the LR). The remotes were worn, so there were some buttons I couldn't see what they did. I could never get the sleep timer to work, but again, not a deal breaker for me. I never called the front desk to ask them to switch it or tell me how. I fell asleep early!The alarm woke me up the next morning, so I was relieved it worked. Went downstairs and had a HEAVENLY breakfast. Spinach, bacon and cheese omlette with a toasted bagel. I'm a bacon snob, and I've been on a diet (which I decided to blow for this trip) and had bacon strips. Oh, they were good. I truly could have eaten a pound of it, if I thought no one was looking! My only complaint is I woudl have liked bigger glasses for the soft drinks. Yeah, I drink a diet drink in the morning, not coffee.Off to my meeting. Came back and talked to a new concierge about getting a shuttle to the airport. This gentleman on Monday was MUCH nicer than the one on Sunday. He wasn't overly effusive, but he managed to get the job done and correctly! My shuttle was to arrive at 6:30 A.M. the next morning, so it was off to dinner with friends and some more walking around.At 6:25 a.m., the only hotel personnel that I saw was a housekeeper sweeping out front. She was friendly, but it would have been nice to see a bellman, or a front desk person. My shuttle arrived, about 6:40 a.m., so I was off.A whirlwind visit, but a hotel I would stay in again, just not for $300 a night. I liked my group rate, thank you very much!"
14,176,"Sep 21 2009 	Good but could be better	We stayed at this hotel for 5 days from 7 Sept. Things we loved about the room - spacious with separate bedroom, clean and beds were comfortable. Things we loved about the hotel facilities - free breakfast with lots of variety, pool and jacuzzi, manager's reception in the evenings.Things that could have been better - friendliness of front of house staff, availability of concierge and pool was quite green and doesn't appear to have been cleaned regularly. Even though it's a great idea for the manager's reception and great to have free drinks and nibbles but expected better quality nibbles (I guess may be too much to ask since its free??). Overall it was excellent value for the rates we paid and location was great."
15,176,"Sep 14 2009 	This hotel is awesome....stay here!	From the moment we walked in the door....no, from the moment we approached the parking entrance and a passing employee stopped to offer instruction for parking and good wishes for our stay, the service in this hotel was first rate.I admit it....I'm a bit of a hotel pig. This hotel did NOT leave me wanting. From the fabulous free breakfast featuring an omelet maker to needing to get a duplicate valet ticket because I lost mine, EACH and EVERY member of the staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome and to be helpful. The purpose of our trip was our daughter's Sweet 16 birthday. We took her and 3 of her friends for a shopping weekend and they all absolutely loved it.I tip well generally because I think it's the right thing to do, but I don't mind telling you to bring extra cash because you'll tip more than usual!After the service, the location of the hotel is great for walking to Water Tower Place/Hancock center and, if you really like to walk, to Navy Pier. Cab rides of about 15 blocks or so ran around $10 plus tip, so not too bad. I would not hesitate to stay in this hotel again. Oh, and one more thing. My stay was FREE as I was using HHonors reward points, and IT DIDN&quot;T MATTER....the service was the same."
16,176,"Aug 19 2009 	nice location but is it really worth the money???	if you're loaded and looking to spend your cash on a hotel, this would be the place to go. don't get me wrong, the hotel is beautiful and located on State Street in downtown Chicago, but honestly, $300 a night is a bit too much for me. And parking within the hotel is an additional $44 per day. The lobby and atrium are gorgeous, as to be expected for this area but the rooms, well i guess it's location, location, location. Around the corner is the Hard Rock Cafe, Rainforest Cafe, Red Head Piano Bar and other various attractions. The Embassy offers a full breakfast which honestly wasn't the best i've ever had. As for the room, we had a living room with flat screen tv and work table, mini fridge and microwave, decent sized bathroom, make-up mirror with sink - separate from the bathroom, and king sized bed. The a/c didn't seem to work very well if at all, the toilet acted close to overflowing, outside window only opens a few inches with the opening blocked by the heavy curtains. Alarm clock in the room does have the option to plug in your ipod/mp3 player but the volume didn't seem to work either. This is a non-smoking hotel so you have to go out to the front in order to do so. There is a restaurant/bar located inside the Embassy also."
17,176,"Aug 4 2009 	Outstanding location service and facilities...	This hotel is one well oiled machine. While we were there, the place seemed to be at 100% occupancy. There was a large family reunion, a large wedding in the ballroom and party afterwards in the atrium. All the while, in another area, cranking out cocktails effortlessly for the usual manager's reception. The staff was courteous yet unobtrusive and quick to respond to your needs. Our rollway popped a rivet which caused it not to close. No problem. A phone call and maintenance is there in five minutes. Rooms are kept in tip top shape. Excellent concierge service.The location can't be beat. One block to the Red Line CTA. Three blocks to Michigan Avenue and the bus lines. Surrounded by good restaurants, chains and indigenous ones alike. The breakfast buffet is icing on the cake, especially for a family. Excellent omelets and lots of other items to choose from.I am a usually pretty harsh judge, but can't think of a more suitable hotel in Chicago for a family vacation."
18,176,"Aug 2 2009 	Good and not so good experiences	My kids and I stayed here for a weekend getaway. I called a few days before arriving, and requested early check in if possible. I was told that a room should be ready for us between 11am and noon. We arrived at 12:15pm on a Friday, waited about 10 minutes for a front desk person to be available to help me, and were told, &quot;Unfortunately, your room won't be available until 3pm.&quot; Okay...I know eary check in isn't guaranteed, but that was disappointing. We left our luggage with in the bellman's closet, and went to get some lunch and do some window shopping. We got back to the hotel at 3:10pm to find a longggggg line of guests waiting to check in. We got in line, and it was finally our turn at 4:15pm. Not a great way to start our weekend, to say the least. Nellie at the front desk needs to learn to put a smile on her face and to speak to the hotel's customers. She was utterly silent while looking up my reservation, generating our keys, etc.By comparison, Hector the bellman is fabulous! Such a wonderful attitude, helpful and a wonderful ambassador for the hotel. Richard, one of the concierges, was great with his help in our obtaining advance tickets for the Shedd Aquarium, and we were able to walk right in instead of waiting in a very, very long line.The floorplan of the room is great for families. The bathroom, however, had issues. There was hair...dark hair (we're all light haired) on the bathroom floor and in the bathtub....YUCK!! I turned the shower massager band to get a different flow from the spout, and the band came off in my hand. We requested a maintenance person come address the shower, and no one ever came. Yes, it was a very busy weekend for the hotel, but that was disappointing as well.We come to Chicago once or twice a year; we usually stay in a burb because the hotels are a fraction of the cost of the hotels in downtown Chicago. We decided to stay downtown this time and see if the higher cost made the experience better for us. Sadly, it didn't; back to the burbs for us from now on."
19,176,"Jul 16 2009 	Great Chicago stay	This Embassy Suites appeared to be better than other Embassy Suites hotels that we have stayed at. Upon arrival at about 10:30 AM, the room was ready. Front desk staff was helpful. The room was spacious, the sink in the bedroom was very convenient with 4 people. The pool was a great plus in a large city. It was a great refresher. The fitness center was much larger and better than other Embassy Suites hotels that we have stayed at. The concierge (Phillip) was very helpful with all of our needs.The only downside to this hotel was the GIGANTIC breakfast line. In other Embassy Suites hotels, the line is much shorter. Overall, this hotel has great rooms, a great location, and great amenities."
20,176,"Jul 8 2009 	Great hotel staff service and location	I've stayed at this Embassy more than once and have never had a bad experience. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. No problems with the accomodations and the rooms are surprisingly quiet on the State St. side, considering the volume of traffic. The hotel is very close to just about everything downtown including great restaurants, entertainment, museums, night clubs etc. Oh, and only 3 blocks from Michigan Ave. The concierge's are quite knowledgeable and anxious to help. Be sure to make use of them for help with your trip and take advantage of the free breakfast and Managers happy hour."
21,176,"Jul 6 2009 	Perfect Location for Tourists But Know about the Extra Charges	My husband and I stayed here for 8 nights for a trade show. The hotel met my expectations--location is great; everything was clean; breakfast was the typical Embassy buffet;the nightly manager's reception was better than most. The hotel was generally crowded with lots of families but not excessively so. Wedding receptions can be noisy here so ask for a room on the upper floors. The pool is small, but that wasn't a concern to me.  I would definitely stay again. I would suggest that you review is the list of charges when deciding where to stay. Parking was expensive at $44 per night, but that's true of all Chicago hotels (see below). The surprising extra charge was the $9.95 Internet charge per day--per computer, which adds up over a week when you have 2 computers for business. My husband and I both need to work from the computer so we each take a laptop. When he was gone with his computer during the day for business, I had to pay to connect with my laptop. The system recognizes the different computers and charges for each. Many chains provide free wi-fi and don't charge for multiple computers so I was surprised. However, this is probably a concern for only a small fraction of people. You can use the computers in the business center for free (including printing) but you can't work from there all day, obviously.The Italian restaurant at the hotel (Osteria on State) is excellent. We had late night pizza twice and had a fixed price multi-course dinner another night. Dinner began with small plates, then a salad, then pasta, then the meat and potatoes. Also in walking distance was the Chicago Chop House, Rainforest Cafe, the famous McDonalds, Volare's, Weber's and many more.You can walk to most of the desired shopping (Magnificent Mile and State Street) areas. The neighborhood seemed safe and was very active. For parking discounts, use one of the public lots within two blocks.I got a much better rate by using GTAhotels.com (no, I don't work for/with them) than I could get with the hotel or my Hilton Honors. ES wouldn't match their rate even though I asked."
22,176,"Jul 5 2009 	Good location for family trip	This property is a good choice if you are traveling with children. We were able to walk to the subway, the bus, shopping, dining, sightseeing. The staff was very helpful (especially Roberto who helped us with our luggage) and the suites were well appointed, with plenty of room and privacy for parents and kids. The bathroom was a bit narrow, as is often the case in Embassy Suites, but the extra sink in the bedroom helps with the traffic flow when your whole family is trying to get ready at the same time! There is no view to speak of, and it sometimes got a bit noisy, but overall this did not bother me. One surprise is that the complementary manager's reception serves a full bar, not just beer and wine. The breakfast got ridiculously crowded, though, and the location of the breakfast buffet in relation to the elevators makes it worse. Another complaint is that the parking is very very expensive, but I am sure that is competitive with other properties in the area. Overall, not perfect, but a good deal."
23,176,Jul 4 2009 	Awesome!	This is a fantastic place to stay! They are very helpful and the breakfast is awesome! The concierge was very helpful. I would highly recommend a stay here!
24,176,"Jun 30 2009 	Great hotel great location!	Our family of 5 just returned from a short vacation (2 days) to the Windy City. I have stayed in a couple of downtown Chicago hotels, and this hotel by far had the best staff and service of any of them. From the parking attendant to the bellhop, the front desk clerk to the concierge...everyone was wonderful. The location was close to Michigan Avenue as well as to the Navy Pier trolley. This hotel is also close to ESPN Zone, Rainforest Cafe, Rock N Roll McDonalds, Portillos and many other great places to eat. A taxi ride to the Shedd was only $11. I thought the complimentary breakfast was fantastic! Yes-it was a little busy...but the lines moved fast and luckily, our 3 little ones waited very patiently! The pool was busy and a little crowded but our kids didn't seem to mind. I didn't feel that the hotel was noisy at all. We were up on the 9th floor which may have helped. (We also came prepared with a noisemaker to help drown out the noise) Our view was that of a parking garage but that was ok...we weren't in our room much. If you are on the fence about where to stay, jump over to this hotel. You won't regret it."
25,176,"Jun 29 2009 	Definite Recommend for Families with Children	My husband and I booked the Embassy Suites for a long vacation weekend with our 20 month old son. This was our first trip with our son, so we were very concerned about how he would sleep in a new environment. The hotel was very accommodating, especially with regard to our need for a crib. They originally gave us a Pak&amp;Play, but send housekeeping up immediately with a 'real' crib when we called the front desk. The last night was a Saturday and there were older kids from dance teams yelling and playing in the Atrium as late as 10:45 pm, keeping our baby awake. My husband had to call the front desk twice to complain, but ultimately the manager on duty resolved the problem and gave us that night free. Despite the noise issue that night, we were very impressed with how the hotel handled customer service issues, and with the general 'can do' attitude of everyone from the front desk staff to valets to maids and doormen.The hotel is brimming with families with children, and the free breakfast buffet is a particular family mob scene. Understandable, because the suite arrangement and perfect location downtown make it the ideal place to stay with children. If I were in town without kids or on business, however, I would run screaming in the other direction. In other words, it's a great place to stay with kids, but if you don't have kids, there are way too many kids!Location is perfect. Just a couple blocks off Michigan, near the Grand train stop, walking distance to Navy Pier, and short drive to Lincoln Park. In and out parking privileges made travel around town a breeze.Biggest pluses were LOCATION, customer service, friendly doormen, great maid service, fun atrium atmosphere, and breakfast. Oh, AND the workout room is great. Not big, but just right for the relative few guests that seem to use it and the cardio equipment is the best I've used in a long time, having visited lots of gyms. Biggest minuses: Chaotic lobby, always packed swimming pool, and crazy loud kids (other than mine, of course)."
26,176,"Jun 23 2009 	Excellent Embassy Suites in Perfect Location	I too think this Embassy Suites should be in top ten of Chicago Hotels. It is in the most perfect location being usually within 3-5 blocks of excellent restaurants and shopping.We loved employee Michael and Phillip was excellent with all of our many questions.The breakfast was typical Embassy Suites and done well and efficiently.The manager's reception was better than most with a hot item each day.The rooms were not luxurious by all means, but clean and well appointed.We stayed here for 6 nights and were very happy the entire time."
27,176,Jun 16 2009 	Great time in Chicago!	Stayed several nights in Chicago to take in the sights and attend a MN Twins/Cubs game at Wrigley field. The location of the hotel was awesome. We walked nearly everywhere and is only a couple of blocks from the Red Line/CTA so getting to Wrigley was a snap. Room was clean and staff was super helpful. Breakfast was perfect for my husband and myself but nothing crazy. Only compliant is Chicago is a noisy city to try and sleep in - sirens go off all night so bring earplugs if light sleeper. Price was on the high end but was expected from location and Embassy Suites. When we bring the kids we would consider staying closer to the Navy Pier but perfect for a couple. We had an appetizer and pizza at their restaurant which was good. The pool only reaches 4 feet which would make it nice for families with small children - hot tub/fitness area are tiny. We were super happy with our stay.
28,176,May 14 2009 	Great Breakfast and wonderful staff!	The staff at the Embassy Suites are amazing especially the breakfast staff! The girls who clear the tables are so friendly and very helpful. The omelets are to die for and to top it off the young manager even helps clear the tables with the girls and still has time to fill up coffee for everyone and seemed so genuine when he made his rounds. Simply wonderful wonderful wonderful!
29,176,"Apr 30 2009 	Not the ""elite"" hotel it claims it is	I stayed in room 538, a handicapped room. I'm 5'10. The shower was not only too short, but the sliding pole the shower head is attached to was broken. I had a meeting at 7am Wednesday morning. My hairdryer started smoking after 5 minutes of use, putting me behind. The front desk kindly sent maintenence up to give me another one. However, when I came back to my room that night after it had been cleaned, I found the old smokey one still attached to the wall and the new one just sitting there on the sink!??? We're not talking regualr handheld hair dryers. These are the dryers with a large base that is supposed to be attached to the wall.To top it off, I went to make coffee preparations for the morning and discovered housekeeping didn't bother to refill the coffee or creamer/sugar. It's close to midnight and instead of going to sleep like I wanted to a half hour ago, I'm sitting here waiting for housekeeping to refill the coffee service. I wouldn't suggest this hotel for business travelers. They need better oversight.."
30,176,"Apr 15 2009 	Enjoy your stay but with some caution	I stay at a lot of Hilton properties in Chicago-- good value for th $$ and most hotels are well reviewed. Hilton owns quite a few properties in Chicago and while I normally stay at either the Homewood Suites or Hilton Garden, this Embassy Suites had a better price and an extra bedroom. Check in was a breeze. Frontline staff very personal and helpful, even our valet parking assistant was great. Our room was ready and it appeared clean in the surface. All's well so far. Out the front door and on to the shopping! Hotels in this area are perfectly located. We returned well into the evening after a great meal believe or not at the California Pizza Kitchen down the road (PF Changs also around the corner). We took stocked of our plans and decided to extend our stay by a day. Again, front staff handled our request with precision and a smile. Went to bed and slept well.Breakfast time!!! I am not at a 5star and don't expect it to be but, why can't the Embassy Suites do something different with their breakfast bar? Don't offer it if you cannot get it right. Worse food I have had in a long time! The place was packed with little ones carrying their dolls (so cute) so it was a bit noisy but that 's okay. They were fun to watch. The omlet was not good. The buffet had cold eggs and bacon and I refused to let my elderly mother eat their cold eggs for fear of bacteria. Coffee cups held maybe a half a cup. Cereal was stale. Thank goodness my mini muffin &amp; fruit were edible.Let's go back to my room for a minute. While I said it was clean, I suggest to Hilton that it is time to change the furniture. The armchair and couch in 622 are badly worn. Isn't this just a cost of doing business, to recover or replace worn furniture? This is the bad. Now for the ugly.Day one I used the main restroom outside of the pool. Filthy! Toilets dirty. Floor had not been mopped in a couple of days or so it seemed. Just get me out and back to the room. Day two, certainly the staff has had time to catch up after a busy Easter weekend full of messy children. I watch the cleaning staff come out of the bathroom with hope. No such luck. Just as bad. Not sure anything had been done! This is the Embassy Suite for crying out loud, not Motel sick! I did register my comments as I am not afraid to speak out for the good and the bad. Come on managment. Don't worry so much about the front fountain and look at what the cleaning team is not up to. And then go eat breakfast in your kitchen. I'll bet you make some quick changes. Sure I will be back because as I said it's good value for $$$. I just wish someone way way up in Embassy Suites would take note and change the food. In my business we either do it right, don't do it, or change the way it's done so it is right."
31,176,Apr 14 2009 	Great hotel with perfect service and amenities!	With a 5 and 8 year old; on a quick spring break. What a delightful hotel! An awesome breakfast every morning and cocktails and snacks every evening in the atrium are included in the price of your room! The rooms are clean and large; the staff was wonderful; great location for downtown Chicago! And fantastic restaurant! This is a great place for business or families! Thanks to everyone at Embassy Suites!
32,176,"Apr 14 2009 	The positive reviews are right this place is great!	Great location within walking distance to most area attractions. Clean, spacious rooms, comfy beds, and the best service! From the nice woman who made fresh coffee for me even though they were almost ready to close down breakfast, the friendly bar staff at reception hour, the great service at the concierge desk (Phillip tried hard to get Oprah tickets - when unsuccessful he made good on his promise to find other fun things for us to do) and so much more. My kids loved the greeting each time we returned to the hotel-&quot;we're so glad you're back&quot;. They felt like little celebrities. We will return to this hotel each time we're in town."
33,176,"Apr 8 2009 	Very Pleased!!	We were in Chicago for a few days as a Spring Break getaway - after reading all of the positive reviews here we were excited to see the hotel. Everything was as described - clean, friendly staff, excellent service. I am notoriously picky about hotels (my poor husband dreads taking me out of town!!) but this hotel met my high expectations. When we return to Chicago, we will be staying here again! Thanks!"
34,176,"Apr 7 2009 	Great Miracle Mile Location/Great Restaurant	Whenever I'm in Chicago, I try to stay at this location. The staff is very friendly. The breakfast is always fresh and hot. The location is convenient to the best shopping and restaurants. Traveling alone as a female, I always feel safe walking in the area at night. The rooms are typical for Embassy Suites - 2 rooms, nice bedding and bathrooms with plenty of light. My favorite thing about staying here is the restaurant that is attached to the hotel - Osterio via Stratta. Awesome food, great service at the bar - Micki is a great bartender/server and always remembers me! The hotel has packages for the American Girl store also. Even when I can get into more upscale boutique hotels, this is a trusted can't go wrong option."
35,176,"Mar 28 2009 	Such a beautiful hotel inside and out	We stayed here with my sister and niece during the Gospel Music Channel's &quot;Gospel Dream&quot; auditions. I was actually trying out. We had a blast. The hotel was so beautiful. It was like walking through a garden, yet you were inside. From the fountains to the lit up trees to the walk ways and bridges you have built inside this hotel...its so beautiful! Our room was very nice! We were happy with the little living and dining room area and our beds were comfy! We loved our view of downtown Chicago! The breakfast was AMAZING for a hotel! Cooked up omelets or whatever you wanted! Overall, great place! Staff was friendly and everything about this place was just wonderful!"
36,176,"Feb 23 2009 	OPRAH FANS - this is the place to stay!!!!	If you are, like me, a huge OPRAH fan, this is the hotel for you!!! We had excellent service from the hotel even before checking in!!! I reviewed the hotel on this site and saw so many wonderful comments, so my girlfriend and I booked a room here. I contacted the Concierge in advance of arrival about possibly getting tickets to Oprah since I was unable to get them in advance of the trip. The Concierge actually returned my call saying there is no guarantee, but that they would surely try to get us tickets once we arrived. That blew me away - I've left messages for Concierges before in other hotels/cities and never received a call back!!! My girlfriend and I arrived at the hotel by taxi and were greeted by Mike, the Bellman. We had lots of bags and were very tired so he was a site for sore eyes! And what a friendly guy! We checked in easily (if you prepay the room, you get a WONDERFUL price so look into that for a steal of a deal!) and received exactly as we requested - upper floor away from the elevator. The hotel has 11 floors and we were put on the 10th floor! The hotel is ATRIUM styled with fountain in the lobby so sound does carry up. It has an open-air feeling to it. Lots of greenery makes it really beautiful! The elevators are fast and there are 4!!!! (I've been in hotels of the same size that had only 2 very slow elevators so this was a real bonus to me!)The Embassy Rooms are so large and roomy compared to other hotels! The flat-screened TV in the living room totally impressed me. But there is also a large TV in the bedroom as well. The beds are VERY comfy! The room was immaculate and having a refrigerator and microwave in the room is nice and convenient.I went to the Concierge desk and talked to Richard, who is so very professional and kind. I asked about Oprah tickets and he explained what their process is. He left a note for the morning Concierge to call the show and request tickets on our behalf. There are no promises but they do make a great effort which is should be acknowledged. The FREE breakfast is amazing! Hot, made to order omelets, pancakes, hash browns, cold cereals, bagels/toast/muffins, fresh fruit, juice, coffee - it's all there. And the cold items are cold as they should be as well as the hot items are hot! The staff clears the tables quickly - leave a little tip on the table for them cause they are very helpful and efficient. When we returned to the hotel in the afternoon, Philip, another Concierge, had left a message saying they requested the tickets from Oprah and would let us know if they heard from them. Philip had gotten the note from Richard and actually FOLLOWED THROUGH! Another WOW!After returning from shopping, Richard was back at the Concierge desk so we stopped to find out if he had heard from Oprah staff yet and he said no. We took the elevator up and by time we got in our room Richard had called and said that the Oprah staff called as soon as we walked away from the desk! We were put on Standby for the next days early morning taping. We were elated! In one hour we were told that we were upgraded to CONFIRMED! Richard even re-confirmed the time we were supposed to be there - then called us back with specific instructions for when to arrive, when we needed to leave the hotel by, and other necessary guidelines we needed to follow.This was totally a dream come true for me - to be able to see a taping of the Oprah Show! We gave Richard a BIG tip for his help! And also tipped Philip for his help too!During the remaining part of our stay, Richard was also very helpful in guiding us for meals. And Philip gave us info about Late Nite Catechism, which was playing at the Royal George Theater. What a hilarious show this is! Catch it if you can - only $30 at the door. Front desk staff was also very cordial. This hotel rates as FIVE STAR service! It is so very convenient to Magnificent Mile. There is a great grocery store across the street and, of course, a Starbucks on the corner. We did not dine in the restaurant or take advantage of the evening reception but both looked very popular with other guests. Overall this hotel rated 5 stars out of 5 on my survey card!!! Primo indeed! I also find it awesome that the management team acknowledges the reviews on this website with their thanks. How spectacular!"
37,176,Feb 16 2009 	Chicago's Best	From the time we stepped on to the curb in front of the Embassy Suites on State street we were treated like Royalty. The doorman opened our taxi doors and carried our bags inside to the desk. He was very funny and carryed a politeness that is not normally seen in a city the size of Chicago. The staff was very polite and helpful. Our room was immaculate!!! The free happy hour every night was exceleent as weel as the daily free breakfast. The Concierge was very informative and helpful. He made recommendations to dinner the first night and gave us passes to a very good night spot. The second night he helped us with reservations to a very nice restaurant. All in all this was a great time and experince at an awesome hotel.
38,176,"Feb 15 2009 	Great Option In Downtown Chicago	This hotel is the best option for a family visit to downtown Chicago. I have stayed in Chicago for business and pleasure, and this is my favorite place to stay for both.The staff here are great, from the front desk to the housekeepers, they are all wonderful. The rooms are clean, standard Embassy rooms. The breakfast is great, and I've never had to wait an extraordinary amount of time.The best of this hotel is it's location. You are a block from the Red Line CTA train and three to four blocks from Michigan Avenue. There is a Rainforest Cafe a block away which is one of the stops for the Double Decker trolley. For a nominal fee, this will take you on a tour of the entire downtown, including the museum campus, Millenium Park, Sears Tower, Navy Pier, etc.Stay here and you won't be disappointed."
39,176,"Feb 15 2009 	hotel was fine restaurant put it over the top!!!	The hotel was fine - a nice, typical Embassy Suites. The italian restaurant was killer good, and I ate there all three nights. I've put this on my 'must stay' list for Chicago, particularly when I am traveling alone, and don't want to walk alone at night for dinner. The restaurant is no compromise, I promise you."
40,176,"Feb 11 2009 	Loved the Embassy Suites -Downtown	My family stayed here for 2 nights in Dec. We booked this hotel after reading reviews and lot of research. Since we wanted to celebrate our Anniversary in Chicago, we were looking for an elegant hotel and this hotel lived upto our expectations. It is a great hotel for families. Rooms are big and clean. It is good for family of 4-5.I liked their complementary breakfast and managers reception. They would serve all those items when we think of break fast. You just name a dish and it is there for B/FIt was wintertime. We could walk down to Magnificent Mile and near by restaurants.We all would definitely stay there next time"
41,176,"Feb 2 2009 	Love the Downtown Embassy	Stayed for New Year's Eve at this Embassy as well as 2-3 other times over the last two years. I can honestly say this is the hotel my family ALWAYS requests. Reasons:- Location is great (as are other hotels in area I know)- Bathroon is BETWEEN bedroom and Livng room with sofabed (may seem insignificant but this is important to parents in that compared with Homewood or other hotels with suites that have the bathroom IN the bedroom area)- Have never encountered one rude service staff member (whatever their position they are ALWAYS pleasant)-The breakfast can be made to order as you wish and is INCLUDED in the price (omelettes and other brakfast items aren't rocket science and for a family of four this service alone adds $40-50 to any breakfast in the city).I must say I really am surprised this hotel is ranked #50. I have stayed at half of the top 20 &quot;most popular&quot; hotels in Chicago and although Sofitel, Park Hyatt, etc. are nicer (best for couples only IMO) , the $2-300.00 price difference doesn't justify the expense. I think this hotel should at least be in the top 15 for value, convienience, cleanliness, and service."
42,176,Jan 27 2009 	great location	Accompanied spouse on a business trip. The location was terrific as it was close to attractions and restaurants/entertainment. The rooms are very spacious. The breakfast was included but was just standard fare. A short wine/cheese offering is included around 5 pm.
43,176,"Dec 31 2008	Loved it	This was our second time staying at the Embassy Suites, the first time being three months ago.Positives:LOCATION!!!Large, clean roomsComfortable bedsComplimentary breakfast (lots of choices)Grocery store across the streetOne block from the subway lineAttractive atriumConnected to a wonderful bar/restaurantNegatives:The hallways/atrium was pretty noisy. Kids were running around, yelling to each other, and generally acting like they were OUTSIDE instead of inside. The noise is greatly amplified because of the atruim design. Fortunately, the bedroom is at the back of the suite so the hallway noise is only a problem in the front 'living room' part. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Embassy Suites very much!"
44,176,"Dec 22 2008 	Girl's Getaway	This was our first time staying at this hotel in Chicago. We have stayed at many other hotels in Chicago and this was our favorite.The location is great! I booked this hotel as it looked to be close to the theater district and the magnificent mile. The location did not disappoint! It is very close to the highway which made it very easy to arrive and leave. In the past we would stay on Michigan Avenue and got trying the get through the road traffic added an extra 30 minutes to the commute.When we arrived the doorman made us feel so welcome. He told us immediately &quot;Welcome Home, we've been expecting you!&quot;The happy hour was good. They had fajitas and a pretzel mix. It saved us money by not having to purchase dinner. The morning breakfast buffet was wonderful. Everything from made to order omlettes to pastries to bacon to fruit. It was very satisfying.The room was very spacious. The beds were comfortable however I didn't care for the pillows. It was nice to have 3 different sinks in the room, this made getting ready in the morning much easier with all the women in the room!I will look into this hotel again when we stay in Chicago!"
45,176,"Dec 15 2008 	Absolutely wonderful	I often stay in Hilton chain hotels in Chicago but had never stayed at this one so thought I would give it a try.Can honestly say it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in anywhere.From the moment at check-in to checking out 4 days later there was not one problem. All the staff were friendly and helpful, the conciege desk was brilliant, the rooms were spacious and cleaned well daily and the wifi actually worked!The managers reception was quite busy so we only went one day, but the breakfasts (cooked to order omlettes - pick you time carefully when you go) were superb.The location is perfect for shopping, just one block from the Mag Mile.Will definitely stay there again."
46,176,"Dec 14 2008 	Magnificent	A magnificent hotel in structure, location and service.The door man at the time of our stay (Michael) was the greatest assistant/tour advisor/watchful eye for my friends and I when we would get seperated and wander in and out from our shopping frenzy.The happy hour was great fun, the front desk were brilliant however their cleaning/room service staff were desperately lacking in English completely which made requests (such as where the laundrette was and whether they could come back later to service the room) very difficult.Hard Rock cafe is not far around the corner and I highly recommend it!The mini convenience store inside the hotel is a rip off - avoid if possible."
47,176,Nov 22 2008 	great family hotel	we have just returned from a trip to chicago staying at the embassy suites 600 north state street. from the moment of arrival we were treated magnificently. the door men were so friendly and helpful. we were travelling with 4 small children and the rooms were ideal for us. they were spacious with very comfortable beds. the breakfast was great . the omlettes were mouthwatering. i would recommend this hotel to anyone. it is especially good for families with small children
48,176,"Nov 18 2008 	Good location but a little noisy	This hotel is located close to Michigan Ave and the many other downtown attractions. You can hop on the free trolley close to the hotel and get to the further destinations for free. The breakfast is excellent though you best get there before 8:30-9am. Lines can be long. My only complaint is the overall noise of the place. The walls seem to have no insulation and I can hear the rooms around me. Also since I went with my family, I slept on the sleeper sofa. I can heard the outside waterfall and people walking the hallways all night. I was tempted to give it only a three star but I guess you can't control your room neighbors."
49,176,"Oct 23 2008 	Front Desk Needs Training	Overall not a terrible place to stay. Great location. Friendly Doorman. However, this hotel is in desperate need of some Customer Service training. The Front Desk staff has turned to apathy rather than their training in dealing with their customer's needs. The breakfast was delicous and hot. Unfortunately the silverware and plates needed some attention. Normally I would stay here 2-3 times per year. I'm not so sure anymore."
50,176,"Oct 21 2008 	Wouldn't recommend for Extended Stay	I stayed here for two weeks for business training. The hotel was in a convienent location near the Magnificent Mile and bus/train stops. The hotel was nice looking. The beds were comfortable. The manager's reception (happy hour) with alcoholic drinks and a few snacks was good when I remembered it. The hot breakfast everyday was great, but don't be fooled by the cooked to order. That only means omlets and nothing else cooked to order. The concierge was very helpful getting reservations and giving directions, but there was only one for all guests so be prepared to wait until the person in front of you has been handled. My complaints: The price for internet daily is 10 dollars or you could use there business center which only has three computers and are always busy. The walls are paper thin in the rooms and you can hear those right outside your door if they are talking in a normal voices. I was almost able to hear full conversations through the vents from the guests near me. You can hear when the guests next door have the water running because the pipes are loud. The noise from the atrium will filter up to the rooms also. There is only one washer and two dryers for all guests that may wash there own laundry. It is inconvienent to be able to get change and laundry detergent at the front desk, but they are willing to give you change and let you buy single laundry detergent. I wouldn't recommend using the laundry service they have because the price is per item (ie. your underwear cost 6 dollars a piece to wash). I would recommend the dry cleaning at the hotel or the dry cleaners about four blocks south of the hotel on the right. The hotel and the travel agency I used didn't get everything straight with the corporate credit card I was suppose to have on file until I checked out on the 12th day and by that time they had already charged my personal credit card for the first week and some days. The hotel did fix this within the next few days, but it temporarily maxed my card out for those few days waiting for them to refund it. All in all, an okay time with a few minor bumps. I don't recommend for extended stays, but do make sure the hotel has everything correct on your reservation once you get there."
51,176,"Oct 5 2008 	Location Service and Comfort	I stayed at the Embassy Suites Downtown Chicago for 5 nights, and was very happy with the property. The included breakfast/ 6:30-9:30am was excellent (eating before 8am is best, as it gets busy later). There is so many great restaurants (Grand Luxe Cafe is one of my favorites) and stores closeby, and it feels very safe to walk about even after dark. I felt it was a safe hotel for a woman traveling alone.Internet access in the hotel is fast, however not free! $9.95 per day. Even if you only use it for an hour in the evening, after midnight you get a 2nd for the next day's useage.The 2 room suite was well appointed with a large comfortable bed, microwave, safe, coffee maker, sofa table and chairs. 2 TV's one a flat screen in the living area. Because there is no desk, the table is your computer work area, and the chairs at the table are hard and uncomfortable. The living room area furniture was hard as rocks and kind of worn in the suite I occupied. I beleive the sofa in the living room was a fold out bed.Other pluses, a pool and work out area that looked beautiful and clean, Manager's reception at 5pm offered free drinks, and snacks. It looked crowded, and one evening I stopped by at 6pm, and there were no snacks left.It is attractive and has a great front desk staff."
52,176,"Oct 1 2008 	Stuck in a smoking room by this hotel	Got stuck in a smoking room. I was told upon checkin that while the hotel was fully booked, but not everyone had yet checked in. I asked for a non-smoking room and was told that &quot;we sold all of our smoking rooms to Priceline.&quot; I know that as a Priceline customer one is second-class immediately, but there was NO hope of me bidding on this hotel and getting a non-smoking room. Terrible experience. Bidders beware of getting stuck here in a room that reeks of smoke!!!"
53,176,"Sep 2 2008 	Great base for touring families	We stayed only one night over Labor Day weekend in conjunction w/ a special event in Chicago (two DB two room suite). This hotel will not knock your socks off with luxury, but it was clean and in pretty good condition. Bed room had a vanity sink w/ door that closed to living area w/ pull-out sofa.Lobby and common areas quite nice. Room pretty average for this type of property. Not the best mattress or linens, but pretty good towels, fixtures, etc. Small fridge and microwave were nice for the family. There are two grocery stores within a block of this hotel. Easy to stock up.Hotel is also on free trolley line (summer only), and short walk to CTA red line, mag mile shopping (with CTA bus services to museums, etc.). Just a great location with a lot of bustle where you can base your city visit.I missed the evening reception but family enjoyed it. Breakfast in the morning was great. Hotel provided guidance on when it gets busy; we avoided the rush and had a pleasant meal. Pool area was a bit tired, and they seemed to have used all available chlorine. Gym appears newly refinished, with pretty good equipment."
54,176,Aug 30 2008 	Great stay	We only stayed one night but the rooms are laid out very nice walk in to front room small hallway with bathroom then a bedroom pool was nice and clean so was hot tub breakfast was very good loved the omlet station
55,176,"Aug 29 2008 	Great!	Got a great package deal through their website. Clean rooms and safe location. Staff was pleasant. The breakfast was good...plenty to choose from, but a bit chaotic."
56,176,"Aug 16 2008 	Great Hotel	SummaryPROS- location, breakfast, friendly staffCONS- very busy, small pool, long line for breakfast and manager's receptionWe stayed the week of 4th of July to enjoy the Chicago fireworks and celebration. The hotel was very convient to the local bus system and within walking distance to various attractions and food establishments. There is a grocery store across the street with a Starbucks. The hotel has a great breakfast and an OK manager's reception. The hotel's pool is a bit small for the number of kids that stayed that week and the fitness center was crowded. However, the fitness center had new Precor equipment. We left a portrait of ourselves from a dinner cruise in our room when we checked out. The cleaning staff and security personnel mailed our photo back to us which was very courteous and customer oriented. Would stay again."
57,176,"Aug 13 2008 	Happy at the Embassy Suites	We travel quite a bit and are HH members so we always try to stay in Hiltons when we can. We also travel with our two young children, so whenever we can, we book suites. We needed to spend 9 days in Chicago and after a lot of research settled on this hotel and have been very happy. PROS: Can't beat the location. great restaurants and shopping all around you and only 3 blocks to Magnificent Mile. We easily walked to Millenium Park and Oak Beach (up by the Drake Hotel off of Michigan Avenue) - my kids did fine with the walk.Easy to get taxis in this location as well.Hotel very clean, well organized, fairly consistent housekeeping. they honored all requests that we made.Great made to order breakfast in the morningExtremely comfortable beds - LOVE the bedsAwesome and easy for families.CONS: The lobby is unusually and freakishly cold - beware.It is a madhouse at breakfast time between 7 and 9:30. Just be prepared and steel yourself. Pool is small. Completely fine, just small and gets crowded easily.If you don't want to be around kids, this isn't a good hotel for you.The only laundry facilities are on the 11th floor; there is only 1 washer and 2 dryers so be prepared to wait unless you go at an off time.There is street noise. Keep your windows closed at night and perhaps use a noise machine to block out noise. We were on the 6th floor and stayed on the Ontario Street side - it was quite noisy at times.All in all a perfectly good Embassy Suites and we'd probably stay here again. You will be satisfied."
58,176,"Aug 12 2008 	Great breakfast great room what more can you want!	Stayed at the Embassy Suites for one night.Check in was a breeze. The suite itself comprised of a living room and bed room. There was a flat screen tv in the living room and a conventional one in the bedroom for those that care :)As it was a reward night, room service delivered free bottles of water to the room. A nice touch. The bed was luxurious and very hard to get out of in the morning!Ah breakfast! Other people have mentioned it but a free cooked breakfast is fantastic. I ate two omelets they were that good.Location wise, it was a 10 - 15 minute walk to Navy Pier and shopping and a subway stop were very close by.Overall, a great stay."
59,176,"Jul 26 2008 	Great hotel and location	Check in was easy; no lines. Hotel lobby is beautiful but very cold in temperature. Our room was spacious and clean. Clean bathroom. The complimentary breakfast is great! There is a hot buffet and made to order eggs. Also cold cereals, pastries and fruit. It was all very good. Go early and you won't have to wait. The later you go the busier it is. You also get a free USA Today every weekday morning.My son used the swimming pool. Nice and clean. My husband used the workout room. Nice and clean.We used the valet parking. It was expensive ($40/day). But the parking garage is very secure.The location of the hotel is good too. You are 4 blocks from Michigan Ave shopping. It is an easy walk. There are lots of good restaurants close by too!The redline train is a block away. A word of caution: Buy your ticket for the train from the machine not individuals trying to make you a &quot;deal&quot; on tickets they have in their hand. Also, the bus will will take you around too for $2. There is also a free trolley that will take you to the Navy Pier.The concierge at the hotel was wonderfully helpful. If you have a question about anything.....ask the concierge. We will definitely stay here again!"
60,176,"Jul 11 2008	nice location	The location of this hotel is totally ideal for those who wish to shop at mag mile since it's just 3 blocks away. Furthermore, the stop for the free trolley to navy pier is just a stone's throw away, making it pretty convenient for tourists. i love the overall design of the hotel, which appeals mainly to families. There is a little fountain wall in which kids can wade in and enjoy themselves. Nonetheless, the size of the bedroom itself is smaller than what you would expect from an average hotel with the same rating. Morever, this is more than compensated for by the adjourned living room with a tv set of its own."
61,176,"Jul 11 2008 	Nice Hotel overall a Few Minor Problems	Over all this was a very nice hotel, super friendly staff, especially the bell boys, they are there for any of your needs, be it luggage help, or even running an errand if you need something you have forgotten to bring!We stayed in a 2 room suite, we had the get away special for 249.00, which included a free bottle of champagne and strawberries, a $25 gift certificate to the Osteria downstairs, and a 1pm checkout.The strawberries and champagne were not in the room as promised but was resolved within a few hours, the gift certificate was only good in the Osteria, (this was unknown too us) we actually ate in the Pizzeria, we showed the hostess our gift card and she told us it was fine only to find out when the bill came it was only good in the Osteria, so we had no choice but to pay the bill in full, we used the certificate towards the least expensive wine for in the room, which still cost us $15.00 after the gift certificate, with surcharges, tax and %18 gratuity!The fold out sofa bed had no pillows anywhere in the suite, and no blanket! Staff was good and brought pillows, luckily my daughter had brought her own blanket.The phone in the master bedroom was broken, but the one in the living area was fine. Had a very small fridge, can't fit much, a family would be hard pressed to get a whole lot in there, microwave was fine, and all the standard things such as coffee etc. were there.The king size bed was VERY soft and had 6 pillows, which were also VERY nice, it was quiet, but the view was awful, we were in room 1117 on the top floor and faced a very ugly parking garage, I would have preferred to see the goings on in the streets.All in all I would say you could probably do better for a 4 star hotel."
62,176,"Jul 7 2008 	Great Location	Excellent Location, Friendly and Helpful Staff. The only complaint i have is the doors to other suites, they slam loud. Other then that it was a great hotel. Busy week there in downtown Chicago during the Fourth of July!!! If you can ,take advantage of the car stays free package because Valet parking is expensive. I would definately stay there again!!"
63,176,"Jun 23 2008 	Location location location	The Chicago Embassy Suites is all about location. Its in the heart of the city, easily accessible to almost anything you could want to do. If you want to go to a baseball game, it's a block away from the Red Line which is how you get to both Wrigley and Commiskey. If it's food you're looking for, it's right across the street from the Webber Grill, right down the street from amazing restaurants like Quartino and Big Bowl and a few blocks from Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due if it's Chicago deep dish pizza you are looking for. However, of course with the location you are going to get a few negatives. It seems everything you have with a normal Embassy Suites was just a little worse. It lacked the little touches. We were there for a long weekend in June, which must be prime tourist season, but there were some negatives.A highlight of all Embassy Suites is the decor inside. While this one did have nice waterfalls running through the hotel, it lacked the huge goldfish that typically fill these pools.The happy hour always had a line, sometimes a very long one. What made this even worse was there was a limit of one drink per person, so everyone you were with had to go up to bar rather than you getting a drink for both yourself and your companion. Seating around the bar quickly filled up and so you could not simply point to the person. Getting a drink meant saving your seat, or worse, if one of you was getting ready, waiting for the other to go down to get a drink.At breakfast there was the same issue. There was a line every morning, and finding seating was actually difficult on some mornings. They include a guide on when breakfast is the busiest in the room.On the last day we were there it took 10 minutes to get an elevator from the 2nd floor up to our room. Then, when we were leaving it took another 10 to get an elevator back down, and we subsequently stopped at every floor.However, almost all of these are the result of the hotel being in such a great location. And you get what you traditionally get with an Embassy Suites: giant rooms and very good service. Overall, if you want location and the quality of an Embassy Suites with just a few downsides, I would recommend this hotel."
64,176,"Jun 20 2008 	Friendly Service Can't Be Beat!	My husband and I stayed there the first week in June while my husband attended a training class. We arrived very early on a Sunday morning, and our driver took us to the hotel to drop off our bags before we went for breakfast and to play tourists for the day. The staff was delightful--immediately checked our bags in the locked bell room, offered to get us a cab (no need---our driver, Al, offered to wait and take us directly to the restaurant!), and tried to see if any room would be open soon, just in case we were tired and wanted to check in (no luck, but HEY, it was only 8 am...). We went off for a lovely day checking out the Chicago sites. Once fatigue (and mild jet lag) set in, we called in hopes our room was ready and it was--at 1pm when check in was 3!After check in, both the floor housekeeping staff and a manager stopped by to see how we liked the room (it was fine), and dropped off some bottled water. After a brief rest, we headed down to check out the manager reception--we've been to Embassy Suites before a we're quite familiar with the amenities. Of course, we were off schedule and wondered why at 5:30, it wasn't open yet--it wasn't until we decided to wander around outdoors that it occurred to us that it was only 4:30 in Chicago.....oops.The nightly reception is a nice touch--in fact, I think one night we basically skipped dinner because we had enjoyed the hors d'ourves and quiet opporunity to relax in the atrium. The breakfast, the same---the staff was so friendly and welcoming. I liked that in your room, they give you an idea of the best times to go to breakfast if you're looking to avoid lines--not that I saw any line so long that it would have frightened me away --even with a huge convention crowd on-site (I worked in my hotel room for part of the day during my stay, and made a few trips down to refill my coffee since their brew was better than the coffee I could do in-room). The manager was great! Encouraged everyone to enjoy their meal. The made-to-order staff was also accomodating--not being an omelet lover, I asked for fried eggs, which they were happy to make. Lots of choices, always a good thing.While I wasn't there long enough to try the hotel's restaurant, I can tell you if it's anything like the room service food--it's a must-do! I had the most wonderful BLT sandwich from there. Of course, in Chicago, you have sooo many food choices. Even the grocer across the street had fun eats. We opted not to try the indoor pool, just not enough time. It looked average, maybe ready for an update. Not so inviting we couldn't resist--of course, traveling without our young kids, it has to be a pretty spectacular pool for us to suit up when we're on our own.The location was within easy walking distance of the training center my husband needed to go to and the Magnificent Mile (which I HAD to go to ;-0) Even with a computer bag (or several shopping bags, it was an easy walk. The musuems and Navy Pier were less walkable, but there is enough reasonable public transportation opportunities to get you there, no matter your budget. Price wise, the hotel was steeper than we'd normally pay for an Embassy Suite, but I realize this is high season, mid-town and there was a huge convention going on, so rooms were going for a premium. If it was our dime exclusively, we'd have to try for an off-season rate.This was our first visit to Chicago and I have to agree with other reviews--it's all that NYC has to offer, but with a smile! We'll be back."
65,176,"Jun 7 2008 	Great value	Stayed here for a short business trip. A 2 room suite with 2 TV's, free breakfast and cocktails, comfortable bed and convenient location was under $240. And if needed, the room also had a small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. A vanity sink was in both the bedroom and bathroom, and a bar type sink was in the galley. Only problem were the bathroom drains--- they seemed sluggish and probably needed a bit of maintenance. Otherwise, an AOK stay. Recommended!!"
66,176,Jun 2 2008	pretty nice place	hotel is above average in service and quality not the best place I have stayed however on a 1-10 scale would be 8.5!
67,176,"May 26 2008 	Great stay!	This hotel is great. the staff is very friendly. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very spacious with a great view. If you drive, be aware that parking is about $60 per day. Also they have a sky lobby. So you have to take an elevator from the parking garage to the main lobby. Then another elevator from the main lobby to the sky lobby and then another elevator from the sky lobby to the guest rooms. At the busiest times of day, be prepared to wait for the elevators."
68,176,"May 10 2008 	Great base for visiting Chicago	Large, clean, quiet, well designed rooms. Good breakfast and complimentary drinks at the bar early evening. A great base in the city for a first-time visitor."
69,176,"May 5 2008	Great location for seeing Chicago	Spent three days at the North Columbus hotel. It is walking distance to Michigan Ave, Navy Pier, and Grant Park's north side. We used cabs to get to the museums (about $11 with tip). The central location was ideal for allowing the family to rest after seeing the sites. Pool was fine, and manager's reception was a nice touch. Breakfast was perfect, especially the made to order omlets. A step above the canned meals offfered at other hotels."
70,176,"Apr 27 2008 	pretty good deal	I found this hotel to be a great value for the money. The room was quite large, we have stayed at many suites in downtown chicago and I think this may be one of the best. Separate living room with sofa bed, microwave and fridge, then large bedroom with own sink in there. Clean lobby and rooms, staff friendly enough on check-in. Huge hotel but had plenty of elevators and had no problem going up or down. Didn't try the pool or cocktail hour, but breakfast was edible, the made-to-order eggs looked the best but I don't like eggs. The location also great, seconds away from Michigan ave. Absolutly no view from room, right into parking garage and was a little loud at night, but that never bothers me. Overall will probably stay here again."
71,176,"Apr 26 2008 	Our Favorit Hotel in Chicago	Our family prefers this hotel to any other (including staying with family members in the city). It is conveniently located to everything we want to do. The staff is so friendly, they always remember us and it is like coming home each time we stay. We find the staff helpful when trying to locate things we are unfamiliar with, and their suggestions on places or servces we want to find are always perfect choices for us. The rooms allow us the comforts of home from the fridge and microwave to the 2 rooms with TVs and the extra sink helps accomodate all of us! We have stayed her since our child was a baby and each and every time they make him feel like a king! Whether it was a crib with a cozy blanket, or a fold out bed made to look like a throne, parents and children are always made to feel comfortable. We like to convenience to the supermarket (on the next corner) to stock up on supplies while in town and everything we need is in walking distance - great restaurants or shopping. We like the fact that we can use the indoor pool and love the hot breakfast with everything we would need to start the day of right."
72,176,"Apr 26 2008 	This is our favorite hotel in Chicago	The staff at this hotel is extra friendly and makes our family feel at home every time we are there. From the time we check in, and all through our stay their friendly and expedient service makes us want to return over and over again. The best value in town and the best location for seeing the city. Being frequent visitor, we appreciate the fresh renovations to the property. As a family traveling together, the rooms are perfect for us with everything we need to make our stay complete. No request seems to be unreasonable and is handled very promptly. Our family loves the hot breakfast in the morning, which gives us more than the standard cold contental that others offers ( a great way to start the day). This is our home away from home in Chicago!"
73,176,"Apr 17 2008 	Unfriendly staff overrated breakfast	Hospitality defined by apathetic and unfriendly staff is what you may experience at your stay here. I was in Chicago for a week, and my husband booked this place, b/c they have a separate living room and bedroom, as well as a microwave. We regretted the decision the day we walked in, where we were greeted rather unkindly by the front desk staff who could not crack a smile.Anytime we contacted the front desk, we had to call back numerous times, as they took forever to answer, although February was no big busy month for hotels in Chicago.The few times they actually got the phone, they were by no means courteous and hospitable. I don't think that guests should be made uncomfortable for asking for basic services or simple questions at a hotel. Part of the fee is for such services usually b/c the traveler is in a new place they don't know much about.I will never visit this hotel again, and highly discourage anyone from staying at Embassy Suites in downtown Chicago."
74,176,"Mar 27 2008 	Good Spring Break Choice	Nice hotel, convenient to many places. Had two problems. First, pool was closed all day Monday after we arrived. Not good - considering it was Spring Break and we have a kid. Second, make sure to put out your &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; every morning before you leave for breakfast. Had a situation where cleaning person came before 9 am, and wouldn't leave after we cam back. Delayed our day by about 1 hour."
75,176,"Mar 6 2008 	Love the hotel but hate the over priced parking! Big time gouge!	The hotel is a superb facility located in the middle of anything you could want to do, even walking in sub zero temps! There is a good grocery store 1/2 block away just to the right once you leave the front of the hotel (not Trader Joe's overpriced snob crap which is also close by). The room was very nice and the beds are sooooo comfortable. We enjoyed the cocktail hour, although the bartenders seemed to be working on a major slow down cue. Lines formed for the duration of the cocktail hour even when simply pouring a glass of beer. My only real beef is with the hotel parking. I read a previous poster who said take the hotel parking as it was such a deal. Well, think twice, it's more complicated than that if you watch your money. If you just want to park and walk, choose the public ramp within feet of the front door on Ontario St. for $12 a day (no in and out service, once out you pay). On the other hand, if you want in and out service, of course a tip each time your car is brought up, then go for the $40 per day. I will go back to this hotel gladly, but will not park in their lot.Lawry's Prime Rib on Ontario is soooo worth going to!"
76,176,"Feb 26 2008	Great location great breakfast	Hotel was centrally located just north of the Chicago River, perfect for the Mag Mile and Hancock Tower and just a few blocks from the Loop. Subway stop within 100 metre walk. Rooms were large, comfortable and well equipped, though being English, the tea was awful, but you learn to live with that!! Pool was pretty tiny for a hotel of this size but it's location makes it more a base for sight seeing than a spa break. The complimentary breakfast was very good with a wide selection which set us up for the rest of the day."
77,176,Feb 23 2008 	Great Stay	I stayed here for 2 nights on business. The hot breakfast every morning was great. The manager reception at night offers 2 hours of free drinks and hot dogs. There is also wireless and wired internet in the rooms. I used a shuttle to get from O'Hare to the hotel but they advised against using one on the return trip. They can sometimes be late and if you are not waiting at the door they may leave without you. I used a taxi instead and it was about $40.
78,176,"Feb 19 2008 	Good Stay Good Location	This hotel is located on State St.It is nearby to a number of fine restaurants and attractions.All of the major attractions are either within a taxi ride or walk.The hotel is nice, the main lobby is not as extensive as you would expect for a regular Embassy Suites but the restaurant area and pool &amp; fitness center are very nice.Our room was on the 11th floor and we had a view of the downtown area. Pros:LocationViewsAccessibilityPool &amp; Fitness CenterCons:Restuarant (No high chairs visible)Basic Room FeaturesThis hotel is a very good hotel if you want to be close to the attractions and the such."
79,176,"Jan 19 2008 	Great Stay	Booked on hilton.com and got a good rate. Check in was very fast, asked for a room on a high floor away from the elevator and that is just what I got. The staff was very helpful.The room was just as expected, living room, small kitchen area, dining room table and a separate bedroom. The room had 2 tv's and 2 sinks not including the one in the bathroom. Good hot water in the shower, nice toiletries. The bed was not that comfy but what can you do oh and no foam pillows. Yes like others said the lines were long for the free drinks at night and free breakfast in the morning (only omelette line) but it is to be expected especially if you come during a busy time. The food and drinks were worth the lines.All in all I felt like I got a great deal and would definitely stay here again and again and again."
80,176,Jan 1 2008 	Great location but nothing special	We had a group of 8 in 4 rooms for 3 nights. Hotel is in a very convenient location close to Michigan Ave. and all shopping with tons of great restaurants close by. Check in experience was very slow due to front desk personnel- both shortage and lack of ability. Rooms were clean but the bathroom had the weirdest swinging door on it that was a big hassle if you were coming in or out. I have stayed at a lot of Embassy Suites but never seen a door like this one. The bed had been updated but was nothing but a standard Embassy Suites room. Breakfast was very good but the logistics of how they had this one laid out caused a lot of confusion by guests and traffic issues. Cocktail hour was good. We ate one night in the hotel restaurant since we were wiped out from a long day of shopping. Food was ok but would not eat there again. There are too many great places close by for the same money.
81,176,"Dec 12 2007	Loved it!!	We really enjoyed our weekend trip to Chicago. The hotel was was really nice. Check in was fast and we even got to check in four hours early. The rooms were large and very nice. I think the one thing that I liked the best was the wonderful free breakfast buffett. They also had on the spot cooking stations if you wanted your eggs cooked special. Everything was hot and very fresh. The hotel is within walking distance to everything downtown. *A must do if you have never been to Chicago. Go to the 96 floor Bar in the John Hancock building about an hour or so before sunset. There is usually a wait to get on the elevator so go early. The sunset is awesome. Also the view of the city is just breathtaking. If you can't get a table, just go into the ladies bathroom and you can see it from there."
82,176,Dec 7 2007 	good location	We stayed here for two nights in october on floor 17.If you have young children or suffer from vertigo stay lower down!The hallways overlook an atrium but the walls are glass..made me feel peculiar!The suites are well fitted out but i would say suitable for 4 max.Free breakfast good quality no waiting and have a much as you like.Happy hour in evening a little souless but hey its free.Location is great and in an area where we all felt completely safe.Well stocked supermarket just across the street.
83,176,"Oct 30 2007 	Fantastic time!	This hotel was recommended to us. I looked at some of the reviews once I'd booked and had some reservations about staying there as someof the reviews were grim.We had a wonderful time right from the moment we were met by the doorman till we got in the taxi to head back to the airport. The room/s were lovely, well apponted, well maintained, clean and had everything we needed for our three night stay. Yes the hotel is more expensive than others but you get what you pay for. The manager reception each evening was busy but you could have whatever (and as many as you wanted) you wanted to drink along with the snacks that were available too. Breakfast was great and hardly any waiting aroundto get served. There did appear to be some queues later on (after 8.30am) but given the size of the hotel it could have been a nightmare. The cook to order omelettes were delicious, I'd highly recommend them.Only gripe was that there was no changing area for the pool so you had to go down in your costume and go back to your room to get dressed. Robes would have been nice for this.The location is ideal, just a couple of blocks from the main shoppingarea and certainly in walking distance to Navy Pier and the Hancock Tower.Should we be back in Chicago we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
84,176,"Oct 26 2007 	We enjoyed our stay tremendously	We stayed at the Embassy Suites Downtown October 14th - 18th. I had read were people complained about the noise from the lobby and from the road, but we were on the 9th floor and did not notice any of these. Managers reception in the evening was great as was the morning breakfast buffet. The reception area was rather cool but we just grabbed a light jacket. The staff was super freindly and the evening doorman is the best. He would greet us at night &quot;How's the family this evening.&quot; My son thought he was the greatest. We enjoyed our stay and it was even better with my company picking up the tab while I was at a conference while the wife and son explored Chicago. It was close to the bus lines and about 6 blocks from the &quot;El&quot; trains. I highly recommend it."
85,176,"Oct 19 2007 	Perfect!	I loved the Embassy Suites... Great location, near the Magnificant mile and lots of primo restaurants.The room was great. If your staying a few days having a microwave and frig right in the room is perfect. Along with internet and flat screen TV?A huge buffet breakfast was included in the stay. You could eat and skip lunch!.. Also, where else can you get happy hour these days with just about any type of drink free?"
86,176,"Oct 16 2007 	Met Our Needs	My family (husband, 14 yo &amp; 12 yo) stayed here for 3 nights. Definitely in the heart of the city. Fairly quiet for being downtown. Extremely helpful and friendly staff. Free happy hour from 5:30-7:30 nightly. Very hearty breakfast. Clean room. Would stay here again."
87,176,Oct 2 2007 	Meet all Expectations and then sum!	Was in town for a city wide convention. Service and staff were great. Rooms clean and well kept. Had trouble hailing a cab in the busy morning crunch time to get to McCormick Place. Walked over to the Marriott and it wasn't any better we waited over 45mins in line to get a cab that day. No fault of the Doorman/bellman just the location of the hotels. I did have much better luck the next few days by walking around the corner to Dearborn and hailed a cab within 2 mins.
88,176,"Sep 13 2007 	Great Location Good Choice	Our family stayed here in late August for five nights. The room was good sized for big city hotel rooms, and having two rooms means that everyone isn't on top of each other all time. Yes the walls are thin, and you will hear city noise, but what do you expect ? You're not in Kansas.  The breakfast was fine, eggs, cereals, yogurt, fruit and breads. No it's not elegant dining but considering what hotels charge for breakfast, it's a significant savings to have a free breakfast when travelling with children.  The staff, parking, cleanliness were all good. The location is central for visiting Chicago. And the neighborhood is safe with people out and about at all hours. I would return."
89,176,"Sep 9 2007 	Great Location Great Hotel	After winning this hotel on Priceline I immediately went to TripAdvisor to check out the reviews. I was worried - the recent reviews are awful. Since booking our stay through Priceline we had no choice but to stay here. I called that evening to request a non-smoking room - &quot;No problem&quot; - I was told. Then I decided to push my luck and request a early arrival - once again - &quot;No problem&quot;. I thought this doesn't sound like the hotel described by others, but I hadn't seen the hotel or rooms yet! Upon arrival the same clerk who I spoke with the night before was who checked us in - she even remembered speaking with me. Then we were given our non-smoking, early arrival room at 11:30 AM! The lobby was very nice - let's go see the room. The atrium is beautiful, the room very well appointed. Very clean and very roomy! The bed was comfy and we also enjoyed the flat screen TV in the main room. Our room over looked State St and there was little noise - remember you are in a big city, staying downtown - noise is part of the experience! We loved our stay here and would highly recommend! Oh yeah, don't forget the free happy hour every night, nice way to start out before you head out to dinner."
90,176,"Aug 20 2007 	Even better Than Expected	I'd heard glowing reviews of Embassy Suites but the photos on the Web site looked just average. I was pleasantly surprised when I met three friends at the lakefront location on Columbus Drive. We had a room with two double beds and a pull-out couch in the living room for two nights. The room was spacious as Chicago hotels go, and well appointed. The beds were luxurious and comfy, with a view of the lakefront a bonus, and the living room and kitchenette very pleasant. The only negative was a feeling of &quot;being in the joint&quot; as we stepped off the elevator and inched our way along the catwalk some sixteen floors up above the atrium lobby. It really is very prison like! Breakfast and the manager's reception were a nice add ons. Though we only subjected ourselves to the evening experience one night as the crowd awaiting service at the manager's reception looked thirsty and threatening. The thunderous rush to the bar at 5:30 sharp was a bit off-putting. We chatted and waited at our table and watched the chaos for 20 minutes and did eventually get a glass of wine, but the overall experience was hordish. The full breakfast was not so bad, but the hotel did use elevator postings to warn of red and green light times for breakfast. So take heed."
91,176,"Aug 16 2007 	No sleep	Room was facing State Street and traffic kept us up all night long along with the noisy people in the next room. Water pipes are loud and you can hear water running all the time. Not a good night's sleep when you have to run a marathon the next day. Requested safety pins from housekeeping, never got them. Will not stay here again."
92,176,"Aug 15 2007 	No no and then again no	I paid 359 USD per night for a room. Stayed here with two children. This hotel depressed us all so much that we tried to find another but it was too late to do so, as anything better was booked. The first thing you notice is the crowd of people in the lobby, then in the lifts (elevators), milling around on the floors. There are people everywhere. You can't get away from them. Saw teen boys making osbcense gyrating movements with their hips to others.The rooms are located around the atruim or quadrangle, so you can look down from the corridor before you enter your room. A bit like subsidised housing. This means that you never get away from people and have to be careful to keep your curtains drawn. The room is not a &quot;suite&quot;. It is shabby beyond description.The sofabed sags in the middle and you have to careful about the windows/curtains which also let in light and noise from all the people coming and going all night long. On top of it, they host events in the restaurant for non-guests til late at night. So forget about a good night's sleep. Oh and if you are on the end of the building which does not face the street, your view from the back window is their multi-storey car-park which is about ten feet away from the room. People parking can see you clearly and you them.Breakfast is a sad crowded affair with plastic trays, lines and more lines and styrofoam/stryene cups. Obviously mass-catering here- plates have that gritty feeling of not being properly washed. What more can I say- we hated this place so much."
93,176,"Aug 5 2007 	Don't Expect Too Much	Maybe I've come to expect too much, but I have to say I was pretty disappointed with our four night stay at the Embassy. My first impression when we walked into the hotel was that it was dirty. There was stuff all over the lobby floor and no one seemed the least bit concerned. The room we requested, a suite with two double beds, was sold out so they gave us a room with a king instead, knocking off $100/night. Ok, that was nice! The room itself was satisfactory. It was a litlle stuffy and the airconditioner didn't seem to work that well. I found the bed hard and very uncomfortable, and the sheets were really, really scratchy. The plasma t.v. was a hit with the kids, though.Several times I tried to call the front desk or guest services for additional pillows and blankets, and no one answered. When I got through, I was told they didn't have any extra pillows. The breakfast was ok, although we've had better at a Country Inn &amp; Suites. There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, some yogurt and bakery goods. Made to order omlets are also available, but we didn't have any. On the weekend, there can be a lot of traffic for breakfast, but the management did a great job of keeping everything moving. There is also a Starbucks in the building.The concierge was knowledgable about the subway and gave us great directions to the red line, which is a short walk away. We walked almost everywhere, except to the Cubs game.Overall, when we pay this much for a hotel room, I expect quite a bit. Next time, we'll forego the &quot;separate bedroom&quot; and book a standard room in one of the nicer hotels in Chicago."
94,176,"Jul 28 2007 	Embassy was ok	It's been awhile since we stayed at an Embassy Suites. This location was in a central location. The rooms were well appointed, but didn't appear to be cleaned properly. Our main issue with the suite was the ventilation system and air conditioning did not operate very well. We found it very stuffy in the room, the air was stale. We ended up opening the window which made it all the more difficult to sleep with the downtown noise.The hotel only offers valet parking which costs $40. We had a package. The front desk was flexible with us allowing us to leave the car there beyond checkout time and didn't charge us.Breakfast was the usual that Embassy serves and was satisfactory.Overall, we were dissappointed with our stay."
95,176,"Jul 16 2007 	Perfect for Kids	This Embassy suites is perfect for families with kids, although I'd choose a boutique hotel if I didn't have kids. The hotel honored my request for 4 rooms in a row for my family and brothers' families. The teens loved being able to go down to breakfast or the evening snack hour without parents (although with the atrium architecture, we could see tham at all times.) The atrium brings a certain amount of noise into the living room of the suite, especially during a Saturday night wedding (thankfully, it ended by the time we returned from the free fireworks at navy Pier.)The breakfast service on weekends was crowded, but the management worked hard to keep things moving with extra serving stations and written advisories about the busy times. Happy hour lines could be lengthy, but moved fairly quickly. I felt the mgt. was on top of the situation, and was very responsive.Richard, the weekend concierge was very knowledgeable about restaurants, which busses to use, and church services.I asked for quiet rooms, which meant we were in the back overlooking the parking garage (but no street noise.) My parents are hard of hearing, and loved their view of State St. at night. Be sure to consider which is more important to you.The hotel was pricey, but the location and service was perfect."
96,176,"Jul 16 2007 	Great choice for families	Stayed during family trip to Chicago. Great experience! Clean and comfortable. Location is unbeatable, we walked nearly everywhere. Would certainly stay again."
97,176,"Jun 19 2007 	Location Location Location	Good value hotel in an excellent location only a short walk from Michigan Avenue with many excellent bars and restaurants on your doorstep, as well as easy access to the FREE Navy Pier trolley and the Gangster tour only a couple of blocks away.The bedrooms themselves were clean and spacious and I have to say the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The only downside to the bedrooms I thought was not having free wireless internet which this day in age is usually pretty standard.I was very impressed with the evening free drinks reception and the breakfast was far better than expected with a good variety to suit all tastes.I will certainly be staying here again."
98,176,"Jun 10 2007 	Great hotel! Just watch the noise...	This hotel is almost perfect. The proximity to the Magnificent Mile, along with the loop make it great for walking. It's also great for public transporation.The evening reception was nice, with a little food and free drinks. The breakfast was also good enough to get you going in the morning!My only complaint is the noise level from the atruim. As all of the rooms have a door facing the atrium, if you are utilizing the bed in the living room, light-sleepers will probably not sleep. However, I heard absolutely no inside noise in the bedroom.Overall, this is a GREAT hotel for the price!"
99,176,"Jun 9 2007 	Great Value	Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Embassy Suites.Great staff, great location and great value are how I would describe this hotel. We were 2 blocks from the Grand station connection to the Red Line to get to the White Sox game (easiest access I have ever had to a pro sports venue) and Michigan Avenue was an easy walk. The Navy pier trolley was convenient to this location. Pizzeria Uno and the ESPN zone were also a short walk.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the breakfast was much more than I expected. There was a great variety of breakfast food and the made to order omelets were fantastic. The two room suite gave us plenty of room and the plasma tv in the living room was a nice touch.They had the best deal we could find downtown for this week and we got our money's worth. Our whole family would love to stay there again."
100,176,"May 31 2007 	Terrific hotel and location	Terrific location; walk to most attractions; took a tour with the Chicago Trolley Company - 1 block from hotel; stops at 13 different location; 2 blocks from Michigan Ave; took architectural tour - beautiful! Great room; typical indoor pool - a bit warm/chlorinated - but not there for pool; Great front-door service - greeted immediately upon arrival by Michael who was so pleasant to us all weekend; breakfast was great - nice seating area; happy hour - nuts, pretzels - nothing real special. Very nice rooms and bathrooms w/marble sinks, etc. Would stay there again."
101,176,"May 5 2007 	Great Location One Room Suite	I was attending a conference in Chicago over a weekend and had to divide my stay between two hotels. I pricelined a room for Saturday night only and won the Embassy Suites Downtown. It was a slightly interesting experience. I had thought all Embassy Suites' rooms were two bedroom suites. Apparently one room on each floor is listed a &quot;King Parlor Suite&quot;--that means that the firestairwell is where the living room would normally be and you just a long hallway to the bedroom in back. I was changing hotels midway and called ahead to ask if I could check in early. They said they had a King Parlor Suite available if I wanted that. It was fine as I was there only one night, bur I was a little surprised when I walked into the room and found it was only one room. The bathroom was also small with only a standup shower stall rather than a bathtub. The toiletries were actually very nice (herb scented) and nice than those provided at the Westin I had stayed at the night before.The room was very clean and well kept and the bedding of high quality, but having stayed at the Westin the night before, it was obviously of a lower star quality with laminated particle board type furniture. That said, it is a solid three star hotel--clean and well kept.. There were one or two weddings going on that night and the noise from the atrium was noticably audible in the room well after midnight. It might be better in the two room suites where you could close the door to the bedroom. Valet parking is conviently located right under the hotel--I think around 37 dollars per night. The parking guys did not lift a finger to help me with getting luggage into or out of my car--maybe it's not their job. Location is convieniently located in River North near the Weber Grill restaurant. The Italian restaurant located off the lobby looked pretty good."
102,176,May 4 2007 	Enjoyed our trip	It's all you would expect from an Embassy Suites Hotel. Location was great as well as the breakfast and happy hour. My only complaints were that the fitness room was very warm and there was not a safe in the room. We loved it though!
103,176,Apr 27 2007 	Great Location!	My spouse and I spent two nights and had a pleasurable stay. Hotel is close to Michigan Ave and 1 block to the L red line. We arrived at the hotel early on our check in day and the staff allowed us to check in. Staff was pleasent and helpful. Room was very clean. We would certainly stay here again.
104,176,Apr 25 2007 	Solid hotel great location	We stayed here for five nights with our two daughters. The hotel staff was always helpful and attentive. The parking valets where especially nice. It's an easy walk to Michigan Avenue. We drove to the museums. Only complaint: There was a wedding one night and the young adults from the wedding partied loudly way into the night. They woke our daughters a couple times. The hotel staff was slow to respond.
105,176,"Apr 23 2007 	Fun Trip - Decent Hotel	Mom, sis and I met in Chicago for a girl's weekend to celebrate my mother's birthday. We arrived at the hotel at 8:45 AM on Friday morning. I was able to preregister at the desk and the employee told me I could check back earlier than 3 since my room would probably be ready. The extremely friendly bellman took my luggage and teased me that &quot;it was so sad we had to go shopping!&quot; Security was also very helpful and locked my laptop in their security area rather than the general luggage hold.We came back at 2 and the room was ready. 10th floor, corner room, 2 doubles. Complimentary bottled water was waiting for us as a HH member. The room was very clean and extremely quiet. Beds/pillows were extremely comfortable. The pullout bed was a no-go as it was just too flimsy. Sis and mom ended up sharing a bed :) I lucked out on that one!!The breakfast bar each day was not crowded, but we were there around 8 am each day. Choices were the normal breads, meats, eggs. The hot foods were slightly cold and the bread a little stale the first day. The next day we got cooked to order eggs which were MUCH better. Overall not bad especially since included in the room rate. We were always gone during the manager's reception so no review on it.The hotel offers free internet in the business center which I used two days to check email and get boarding passes. The room did not have an ethernet cable (I forgot mine) so my laptop was of no use. The location is awesome with just a few blocks from Michigan Ave. We had restaurants all around and walked everywhere. We walked to the Oriental Theater Saturday night and did not feel unbearingly unsafe on the walk back - we speed walked back and made it in about 12 minutes :)Overall, nice clean hotel, great staff and comfy beds. Great location!!"
106,176,"Apr 12 2007 	Excellent location on budget	We have a family of 4 so to get a room that would accommodate 6 was superb value for money. The breakfast in the morning is more than adequate and the managers free drinks in the evening was a bonus.The staff were very friendly and helpful, I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the city on a budget."
107,176,"Apr 8 2007 	great location mediocre hotel	Booked too far in advance and was stuck with a pricey, inflexible reservation. Lovely view of a parking ramp. Note that the luggage carts can only be used by bellmen. There's a lot of nickel and diming at the facility, which isn't very family-friendly. Breakfast buffet is largely inedible."
108,176,"Mar 31 2007	Good location decent suite.	I spent three nights here on business for a conference at the McCormick Convention Center. The location is excellent with respect to tourist locations in Chicago, but poor for getting to the convention center. The hotel staff was nice and gladly let me switch rooms the first evening due to problems with a neighbor. The hotel was a little noisy with tourist traffic (i.e. kids running around), but evenings were quiet. The rooms were large suites, which was a little overkill. The kitchenette area was in need of some renovation. In both rooms, the cabinetry was warping and there were stains on the floor near the minifridge. Everything else was average. Breakfast was included, and consisted for the standard bagels and muffins, in addition to hot items like an omelet bar, bacon, sausage, eggs, hasbrowns, etc. While the room wasn't as nice as I had anticipated, the overall experience was satisfactory and I would consider staying here again if other options were booked."
109,176,Mar 31 2007 	Very Comfortable - Very Affordable - Good Quality	This hotel is centrally located to many of Chicago's inner-city major businesses and restaurants. It is very close to the underground metro and taxi service is easy to and from all locations. The rooms are quite comfortable but I needed maintenance to turn the air handler to &quot;Summer&quot; as all I could get was warm air and it was 80-degrees in the room. The manager's reception is quite nice and you can make a meal of the snacks that are served. I secured this reservation directly with Hilton Hotels and actually received a better rate ($149) than Expedia. One final note - Homewood Suites downtown is a far superior lodging accommodation and is also part of the Hilton Hotel chain.
110,176,"Mar 28 2007	Hotel and Staff Are Fantastic!	Spent this past weekend with my husband @ the Embassy Suites Downtown and had a fantastic time. We were very impressed with the hotel and all of the &quot;extras&quot; (fabulous breakfast, Manager's evening reception). We were equally impressed by how friendly and helpful the staff of the hotel were. We will definately stay there again on our next visit to Chicago."
111,176,Mar 16 2007 	Nice Hotel in the middle of Downtown	I stayed here for a convention that I attended. What a great place. They have a free cooked to order breakfast daily and in the evening they have a Managers Complimentary snacks and cocktails from 5-7 nightly. Lobby area is actully a floor above from the ground level which makes it a nice place to sit and relax. This is also where the breakfast area is. The rooms are mini suites and are very comfortable. The hotel is close to all of downtown and within walking distance from the Navy Pier. The city of Chicago is a great town. Other members that attended the convention were staying at the Sheraton and the Ritz across the street from us and were disappointed. They had to pay for everything including the newspaper. Our was delivered free daily to your room. There were a lot of families there also so I would recommned this hotel for families. Overall great place and very convienent. I would stay there again for business or pleasure.
112,176,"Mar 2 2007	Excellent Service...Close to everything	I have not stayed at this particular property in about 5 years, moved to the Lakefront Embassy for awhile. There has been a renovation done and it is great. Service is fabulous as I expected, rooms roomy and comfortable and well decorated. Breakfasts are the BEST...cooked to order or yogurt or doughnuts...etc. This hotel is close to all shopping, theatres and nightlife. I enjoyed the valet parking free &quot;deal&quot; offered by Hilton. It was nice to pull into the heated car lot, have someone park my car and take the elevator up to checkin. Loved the doorman, very kind and friendly and the evening hospitality included hot dogs, free drink and munchies. My 16 year old daughter and I took in the show &quot;Wicked&quot; and it was a great walk there and back. We love Chicago and all it has to offer and we love Hilton Hotels in Chicago!"
113,176,"Feb 16 2007 	great location	Great location! Girlfriend w/e....adjoining suites. Nice size living room area in suite,clean, good showers, lot of towels,empty refrig, microwave, hair dryer, drapes make rooms really dark. Entire staff was extremely friendly &amp; helplful. Walking distance to Water Tower Place, the &quot;bean&quot;, restauants. Includes full buffet breakfast (hot/cold foods) with lots of seating; also manager reception in evening. Nice lobby. Would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
114,176,"Jan 23 2007 	Loved it!!!	The hotel was beautiful! Location was awesome. Large, spacious rooms. Large bathroom, clean too! Everyone was so helpful. The free breakfast was really good, nice TVs in the bar area. Elevators are fast, never have to wait. Parking is great underground, dont have to worry about your car. Down the street from hard rock, rock bottom, rock &amp; roll mcdonalds. 5 min ride to navy pier. 5 min walk to michigan ave. Perfect perfect perfect!! Would definately stay again."
115,176,"Jan 17 2007 	Very happy with the Embassy Suites	Just returned from a 5 night stay at the hotel with my husband. The location is perfect. You are two blocks from Michigan Avenue, and one block from the Grand Subway station. There is also a Starbucks right beside the hotel and small grocery store right across the street. The breakfast at the hotel is the normal stuff at breakfast buffets, omlettes were nice. The nightly reception was also great. It was very crowded over the weekend, but we never waited more than a few minutes in line for breakfast or for a drink a night. The room service was so-so, over priced, had it one night for dinner. The room looked like it had been redone recently. Linens were nice. There was a little bit of street noise at night, but we were so exhausted every night from walking around that I hardly noticed it. The workout room was great, had 3 treadmills, 2 elipticals, and 2 bikes, plus free weights. We did most of the tourisist stuff and really enjoyed ourselves in Chicago. I highly recommend going to see Wicked at the Oriental theater. Outstanding performance and enjoyed the venue. Also check out restaurant.com before you go, as there is many restaurants in the downtown area. We had an amazing dinner at the Chestnut Grill on Chestnut Street near the Hancock building. I bought a gift certificate on restaurant.com for $10 which we used."
116,176,"Jan 4 2007 	Freezing cold pool!	My husband, 4 year-old daughter and I stayed at this property December 30 - Januray 2nd. Overall, the hotel was clean, staff were friendly and the location was great. Unfortunately, we had a few problems.Our room, upon arrival, was very cold and the cable was broken. A custodian came to fix both problems and was successful after several hours of work. My biggest complaint was the pool. The tile appeared dirty and the temperature of the water was very cold. We complained the first day and the staff admitted the heater had been turned down (why?) and that they would increase the temp by the following day. The next day, although it was a bit warmer, it was still too cold for us to swim. Since the pool is my daughter's favorite thing at any hotel, the cold temp really dimished our enjoyment. We will not return to this hotel."
117,176,"Dec 27 2006 	2 Stays - Both Awesome!	Family and I stayed two nights at the beginning of the week and one night at the end of the week. I'm sure there are other great places to stay in Chicago, but it would be hard for any of them to beat the Embassy Suites Downtown. The staff - from the doorman to the bellhops to the front desk to the breakfast and evening hospitality crews - are all first class. Any request was met with a smile and &quot;sure we can&quot; attitude. None of the nights were sold out, so evening and breakfast crowds were not too bad. On the Friday night stay, there were definitely more families with more children. This was most noticeable in the pool and business center (the hotel should ban under 18 from the business center). We got an incredible Internet rate through the Hilton web site, but this place would have been worth a higher price. The place is modern and everything was in great working order. The breakfast line is very efficient as the get the omelettes started and add the ingredients as requested - it helps keep the line moving. Was always able to find plenty to eat and places to sit.There is a grocery store right across the street and plenty of restaurants within easy (and very safe) walking distance. The grocery even has a good deli counter with hot food. If going to Navy Pier, the free trolley is fine, but not as frequent as the bus (a bargain at $2 per adult and older child). Someone told me their family took a cab - $10, including tip. The Chicago Childrens Museum is really loads of fun - check your local museum for reciprocal membership privelages.I will definitely try to stay here on any return trip, especially at a great rate."
118,176,"Dec 27 2006 	nice but i overpaid	Booked in mid nov at the embassy web site and got an internet rate of $249. Thought it was a deal, until I checked again a week before i left and see I could have saved about $75 a night. Do not ever book any internet rate. Booked $249 for a king, asked if they could accomdate a double when I got there, they said no, since I had a pre-paid room. Almost $1000.00. Sad thing was the hotel was only half booked and I could have had a double if they really wanted to give me one, and I am a Hilton Member too. Breakfast was good, evening reception was good, loved Chicago, but next time will stay in a cheaper hotel."
119,176,"Nov 29 2006 	Great stay during Thanksgiving	My family stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday. Although the hotel was very busy, the staff dealt with everything wonderfully. We were warned that the lines at the morning buffet would be long, but we never encountered a bad wait. The breakfast selections are good, but never vary. This could get old if you are staying for a long time. This hotel has an exceptional location - it is very convenient for shopping on Michigan Avenue and there are many excellent restaurants within easy walking distance. There is internet available, but it is not free."
120,176,"Nov 26 2006 	great experience at embassy suites	we stayed at the embassy suites over the thanksgiving holiday. check in was very easy and fast. our room was very nice and clean. after we arrived in our room, a maid came by and brought us ice and terry robes to use during our stay. the evening reception was very nice also. the bartenders were very friendly, even though we had to wait in line for our drinks. (the hotel was booked full) . breakfast omlets were very good also, my only complaint would be that the buffet food could have been hotter. But overall we were very satified with our stay, and would stay there again."
121,176,"Nov 6 2006 	Awesome Location	The Embassy Suites Downtown is located in the middle of everything. The rooms are comfortable and very clean. We loved the complementary breakfast and the free drinks they serve from 5-7. There's a Starbuck's and ColdStone Creamery in the same building, which we loved. It's almost impossible to find hotels this spacious at this price!"
122,176,"Oct 9 2006 	Great location great value	Stayed at the Embassy Suites Downtown for 5 nights to attend a business conference. The location is fantastic, with no need to rent a car if you can make it to the hotel without one (take the airport shuttle or taxi). Everything is in walking distance, great restaurants close by, and in a safe area. The front desk managed to find a free King suite upon my request at check in, since I had been reserved a double by mistake. Rooms kept clean, the bed was very comfortable, absolutely no problems with the room. The extra value is in the daily breakfast and manager's reception. Even if the line seems long at breakfast, it moves quickly, and there are always tables available by the time you need one. The nightly happy hour is a nice change from the 12 dollar drinks you will pay at area restaurants, so take advantage of it if you're so inclined. Not premium brands, but hey, it's free. It was also very nice to be greeted upon returning from to the hotel each evening with a friendly, &quot;Welcome Home!&quot; by the porter. They seem to make an effort to be friendly and warm. I would use this hotel again."
123,176,"Oct 3 2006 	Liked staying in this area	Found this property to be a decent value and a great neighborhood. I have an emotional attachment to the Palmer House, but this was cheaper, and, of course, there is free breakfast, free drinks and plenty of space. Everything was pretty well managed and maintained. I really liked staying in this part of town...it feels a little scary in parts of the loop after dark, but it felt safer walking around in this area. The selection of restaurants was better, too."
124,176,"Aug 28 2006	Nice hotel right in the middle of the downtown action.	We stayed at the Embassy Suites Downtown for one night. It is a nice place, and one of the cheapest I could find right in the middle of downtown. The only thing that we didn't like was the parking situation. It was a hassle to get into the garage w/ traffic, but the valets were nice when we finally made it in. The only issue was when we were ready to leave we had to wait a while for them to get the car from an outside lot  so your car doesnt always stay in the garage. The room was very nice and clean. Most of the staff was friendly (with the exception of the front desk person). We didnt take advantage of the Managers Reception, but had the complementary breakfast the next morning which include an omelet bar. Yum! I recommend this hotel if you want a nice room at a cheaper rate than most that are downtown, right in the middle of the action!"
125,176,"Aug 26 2006 	Downtown Chicago Embassy was Sweet	This is the best place that I have stayed at in Chicago! The location was excellent, just a couple of blocks away from Michigan Avenue and some great restaurants. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. Do not hesitate to ask them any questions. I especially enjoyed the manager's reception, which featured free drinks and snacks from 5:30 to 7:30 every evening. (The snacks were soft pretzels, tacos, and hush puppies on the nights that I stayed, but chips and pretzels were also served each night.) Some people complained about the selection, or the speed in which they were able to get their free drinks...but it's FREE DRINKS IN CHICAGO (not something to complain about in my book). I was able to get the drinks that I wanted, and as many as I wanted, within the 2 hours. The bartenders were also very friendly.The breakfast was decent enough. French toast, bacon, sausage, and eggs were plentiful as the hot breakfast each day. Bagels, toast, cereal, milk, great orange juice, and passable coffee rounded up the daily breakfast offerings. I'd recommend having a peaceful early breakfast (around 7am) instead of joining in the chaotic rush around 9am.I will definitely be staying here during my next trip to Chicago. Here's a tip: The parking is about 10 bucks cheaper per night at the lot around the corner from the hotel on Ohio (just a quick left before State Street) than at the actual hotel lot located on State Street."
126,176,"Aug 14 2006	couldn't of asked for better hotel!	Went to spend 5 days with friends, and children. What a great place! The staff was helpful, the free breakfast and managers reception was excellent, couldn't of asked for a better value. Only drawback was the swimming pool was only 4' deep, but didn't bother our 9 years old. They had a great time anyway. The rooms were clean and well maintained."
127,176,"Jul 14 2006	Great Place	Got a really nice rate from Priceline and spent the weekend at this place. The breakfast is second to none, and I really liked how the lobby was set up. PERFECT LOCATION. Its is walking distance from everywhere. Other people have written reviews that criticize the noise, but on the 13th floor I didn't notice any. Its withing walking distance of the mile and many other attractions. If you want to hit the Sears Tower, I also recommend walking (kind of a hike but there is a lot to see). Great hotel, and I have been to many."
128,176,"Jul 7 2006	Had a nice time	We stayed here on July 3, 2006 with our 2 kids. The location is close to everything. We were able to walk to Rock N Roll McDonalds, Rainforest, Hardrock, and Ed Devebicks (sp?). We also caught the sightseeing bus by the Mcdonalds. We walked and shopped on Michigan Avenue. The subway station is also nearby and we took it to Millenium Park and Grant Park for Taste of Chicago.The staff was very friendly. There was a 2 hour cocktail reception and breakfast included. There was plenty of seating for both. We loved having the extra space in the room. We parked in the parking garage and didn't have any problems.The lobby area was really pretty with a cascading waterfall.The only complaint we have is the kids said the pool was too small."
129,176,"Jun 29 2006	Excellent Family Hotel	My family stayed here for five nights and had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge was very helpful and gave good advice. The place was very family friendly. The breakfast and evening reception, while not fancy, were quite wecome and make the hotel a good value for a family.The location was great - restaurants and a grocer nearby. Michigan Ave. was just a couple of blocks away. The train was just a block up the street.Sun - Wed were great, with no lines at all. Starting Thursday it got a little crowded and the pool got a bit rowdy. Otherwise, we had no complaints.All in all, a great place for a few days in the city with the kids."
130,176,"May 10 2006	Great Honeymoon	We were on our honeymoon and from the first moment we arrived, we were treated very well. Our suite was on the top floor and was clean, comfortable, and nicely appointed. It was cleaned to the same state each day by the staff. Gina and Richard at the concierge were outstanding and gave us several excellent suggesions for dinner such as Bella Luna and the Grande Lux Cafe. Both were awesome. Richard also got us booked into the Pennisula Hotel Spa on very short notice for a wonderful couples massage.The Hotel is perfectly located a few blocks off Michigan avenue. It is surrounded by many, many resturants and bars.The one item that was less than perfect was that the airconditioning unit did not cool the room very quickly."
131,176,"May 9 2006	Two nights at the Embassay Suites	Nice hotel, excellent location. I had requested a late check in, which may have explained the back corner room facing parking garage. A bit noisy but not bad. Rooms were clean, not prisitne, but clean. Beds comfortable. Breakfast included was a nice touch but cafeteria fare, and bland coffee!! Managers reception nice, cocktails good, staff friendly, hor doerves minimal and frozen. But still a nice place to grab a drink before dinner. Front end staff accomodating, door man pleasant. Maid service was congenial.All in all, I would stay again, but basically a nice place to stay not over the top in any way."
132,176,"Apr 19 2006	Highly Recommended	I stayed here with a group of 7 women and everyone of us would recommend it. The location is fantastic with shops, bars and restaurants right on your doorstep. The rooms were cleaned every day, and towels replaced which was great. Breakfast was included and offered a good selection. We really appreciated the Managers Reception every evening, where we were shocked to find that drink was free for 2 hours!!! The staff were very friendly and always willing to help. If I were to fault the hotel it would be on the leisure facilities. The pool is quite small and on the one occasion I got into the jacuzzi with my friend there was children jumping in and out of it constantly which really annoyed us.However it didn't stop us enjoying ourselves, and would definitely stay here again if I returned to Chicago."
133,176,Feb 26 2006	Great stay	We have stayed at this hotel many times. This was the best stay by far. The service was excellent... Friendly staff. Great happy hour and breakfast. I highly recommend this hotel. Also had a great meal across the street at Weber Grill.
134,176,"Jan 22 2006	Embassy Suites on State - Great	We especially appreciated the helpfulness of Titus, a Food Service Manager, and Richard, the concierge. We would definitely come back to stay at this hotel, with its great staff, location and services."
135,176,"Dec 12 2005	Good family hotel	My teenage daughter and I stayed here in July 2005. Hotel is a block from a subway station (we rode a train from Midway) and is close to a bus route that goes to Navy Pier (good for nighttime). We were able to walk everywhere. Michigan Ave about 3 blocks. There is a Starbucks and a nice grocery store across the street. Many restaurants within a block - ESPN Zone, Hard Rock Cafe, Pizzeria Uno, Weber Grill and quite a few others. Our room was standard for an Embassy Suite. It was very clean and non-smoking with a king bed that was comfortable. I asked for a room away from the street so we had a view into the adjacent parking garage but the room was very quiet. We were at the hotel midweek and there were lots of noisy kids. We only ate breakfast once as it was crowded but there was a separate seating area for young children with small furniture, cartoons on a big screen and kid-friendly cereal. Concierge,front desk and doorman very helpful. Internet access is overpriced. The refrigerator is filled with expensive minibar items.We took those out and went to the grocery instead. Pool is small. Mostly kids using it."
136,176,"Sep 10 2005 	Good Location Okay Hotel	This hotel has a good location and the rooms are nice; service was fine. There were far too many kids running around on the weekend -- and I do mean running. It includes breakfast, and the food was marginal. It was a full breakfast, served in an unattractive manner. Not much selection on the bread front. The food at the attached restaurant was great, though. This is probably a great place on the weekend for families with younger kids, but that is not my situation. I was primarily there on business and had to stay over the weekend. It was much more quiet during the week. The guys working in the garage were very nice and helpful."
137,176,"Jul 11 2005	We stay at this hotel ever year	Every July we travel to Chicago for shopping and all the attractions. This hotel was our first in Chicago. It has everything you need to have a comfortable trip from the cook to order breakfast to the managers reception, this place is our favorite. See you in July."
138,176,"Jun 15 2005	Problems with Parking	We went to Chicago to go to the Cubs - Red Sox game and stayed here as we called and the stafff stated it was only a block form public transportation. We knew better than to try and drive to Wrigley Field. We were not allowed to leave our car in the hotel parking lot for 4 hours after checkout, without paying a $28.00 per hour parking fee. I was very disappointed that the hotel would not accomodate this request. Otherwise our experience was fine but I would not recommend this hotel nor stay there again."
139,176,"Apr 19 2005	Great location nice staff	We arrived early to the hotel and was greeted by a very nice doorman. He advised us to keep the car flashers on while we checked into the hotel. The front desk staff was average, basically asked for our form of payment and gave us our room key. Our room rate included parking. We drove down to the parking garage (which is next door) and gave the valet our keys. If you purchase the parking with the room, be sure to tell that to the valet. The hotel does not give you a voucher of any kind. The valet was very nice and we walked right up to the hotel. The garage is heated and looked very clean for a valet garage.Our room over looked State Street. We heard the El at night time, not good for a light sleeper. The rooms are paper thin! We heard our neighbor's alarm go off at 6:00am both mornings. Since this property has a pool, you get alot of children running in the hallways. That was a bit distracting, but not nearly enough when the kids would yell down to their parents who were sitting in the atrium. Not the hotels fault at all--just parents that need to watch their children a bit more and respect other hotel guests. Breakfast was average. We learned one imporant thing- if the eggs look glossy- dont eat them! The eggs tasted like rubber on Saturday then alot better on Sunday. The pancakes, sausage, and bacon were very good nonetheless. The staff took extra care in making sure the buffet was full of hot food....hasbrowns, eggs, toast, pancakes, sausage and bacon. The wait staff was always there to clean up a table if someone left. I was impressed because on the weekends it can get very busy. Once you left they were there cleaning off the table for the next guests. They aslo did a great job in keeping the atrium clean during the &quot;mad rush for breakfast&quot; hour. Everyday they have a managers reception. It was nice to sit in the atrium and enjoy a nice glass of wine while looking at the waterfall. The atrium was just splendid! The El station is not far, just the next block over. We were in town for a Cubs game. We got on the EL Red line to Howard, and got off at Addison. The ride is not that far either. Before you knew it you were at the game , and vice versa coming home. It beat us sitting in traffic, or hailing a cab. The EL employees at the station were very accomodating, as well as getting everyone though the line safe and fast.Over all our expericence was average for an Embassy Suites. If you are a light sleeper, try to ask for a room away from State Street. Being in downtown Chicago you cant help hearing horns, and emergency vehicles but the El is a noise that is less to be desired of.Location was only 3 blocks from Michigan Ave. Which was okay- after we ate at the Cheesecake Factory near the John Handcock tower we needed a brisk walk.Love Chicago and I am sure we will return very soon."
140,176,"Mar 17 2005	Great place to stay!	We just returned from a week staying at the Embassy Suites Downtown. We were very pleased with the service, the employees, the room, really most everything! The breakfast was really very good. We noticed if you arrived late in the morning the lines were a little long but being an early riser, it wasn't a problem. The atrium where you ate was really light and beautiful with waterfalls and other running water - very pleasant. We only attended the evening ######## time once. It was fine, though we're not much for alcohol and we were usually busy doing something else in Chicago which we love. The conceirge was really helpful and got us priority seating at the Cheesecake Factory on a Saturday night so that we only had to wait 10 minutes - fantastic! The doormen remembered us as we would return which was fun for our teenage daughters. The room was very clean and had 3 sinks which was great. The only minus was the beds were pretty hard and uncomfortable to me. The location is a big plus. Close to the El, and only 3 blocks from Michigan Ave. We were on the 11th floor looking toward the lake which was a beautiful view! We would definitely stay here again."
141,176,"Dec 25 2004	A good deal.	The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are very nice, I am presuming all the rooms are suites? (per the title). Our room had two rooms, two TV's a small dining table, four chairs and a couch. The room was (and more importantly the bed) were very comfortable.The best deal though is the happy hour, I thought that this would involve two for one but it is all you can drink from 5 - 7.30 pm, this is perfect if you want to party in Chicago, don't get me wrong this is not a big out of control party full of rowdy types but it is great if you want to have a few drinks before hitting the town in an evening versus paying Chicago prices all night.The breakfast in the morning was standard but good.All in all in you take advantage of the hapopy hour and breakfast a good value package."
142,176,"Oct 27 2004	A Great Choice	The Embassy Suites at State and Ohio in Chicago was a great choice for us. From the initial welcome by the doorman to the front desk staffer to the maid to the bartenders at the evening cocktail party to the waiters at breakfast, everyone seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome as guests. Our suite was on a corner and thus didn't have the usual corridor window - this was a plus for us. The suite looked like it had just been redone and everything was in tip top condition. The area has great restaurants nearby including the Weber Grill just across the street. The three block walk to Michigan gave us a chance to see lots of other shops and restaurants. We had initially considered one of the small botique hotels like the Whitehall or the Tremont, but are very happy that we selected the Embassy Suites for our five night stay. We can't say enough good things about this hotel."
143,176,"Sep 21 2004	Great location! Great Staff	We stayed there in early Aug. 2004.The location near the subway was a big plus. Having Starbucks right there was another big plus. The staff was very accommodating, especially when we arrived early and stayed late, they let us check out bags at the desk. Comfy beds.I recommend asking for a room NOT right in front of the elevators-it's VERY noise there. My biggest complaint is that the stairways seemed to be only for emergency use. If I didn't want to wait for an elevator, I was more than happy to use the stairs, but they were locked. When I asked about it at the desk, they just said &quot;oh, sorry, they're locked&quot;."
144,176,"Jul 31 2004	Stayed at Better Embassy Suites	We stayed from July 26 - 30 2004. The location is perfect for downtown attractions. Within walking distance to ESPN Zone, Shopping, Navy Pier. The lobby is very nice and the staff is very welcoming. We stayed on the 7th floor on the very end. This was nice because we had 2 different views to look outside. The room itself was very outdated. There is no ventilation in the bathrooms and so your room felt damp and humid at all times. Our clothes were even damp feeling. The bathtub was cracked and chipping. The beds were very comfortable (not cheap mattresses). The managers reception was dissappointing. No beer!! It's held in the middle of the attrium with kids running around. Breakfast was awful. Was there for 4 mornings and never had a hot breakfast. Ate the cooked to order breakfast. Nothing cooked to order about it. Everything was cold. Only thing hot was the coffee. For a $200+ a night hotel. Was not worth it. Have stayed in much better Embassy Suites. Would not go back."
145,176,"Jul 25 2004	Hotel in need of updating	I have stayed at this Embassy Suites hotel in the past and I used to think it was a nice place to stay. This time I was traveling with my mother and looking forward to another good experience at Embassy Suites down town. Unfortunately, we were disappointed.The room, especially the plumbing, showed age and was a bit run-down. There was some mildew growth in the shower and at the drain in one of the sinks. The faucets were old and somewhat damaged and in need of replacement. The free breakfast was budget-white-bread and barely appetizing. The room was okay - but nothing special for the price.We paid over $200.00/night. I read somewhere that the hotel was &quot;recently updated&quot;. Having stayed here 6 years ago, I can honestly say this hotel has not been updated. In fact, the hotel has declined and is in need of a makeover. (especially the bathrooms) I will look for a new place to stay next time I travel to Chicago, which is a bummer because I love the location."
146,176,"Jul 23 2004	Great location rooms are average	The location is very good, but the hotel is showing its age. The carpeting in the main hallways is nice, but the rooms and furniture are showing wear. To pay over $200/night, you would expect better decor. The pool is tiny.The breakfast was probably the worst of all Embassy suites I have stayed.There is room for improvement !!!!"
147,176,"Jul 5 2004	""A Good time was had by all""	The Embassy Suites has fulfilled the realtors cry of &quot;Location-Location-Location&quot; We checked in for 3rd and 4th of July, 2004, and had an easy walk down to Grant Park for Taste of Chicago, and later, a short walk to near-by Navy Pier to view the fireworks. We will try to get rooms in winter, as we are seasons subscriber to the Chicago Symphony, and so many other interesting places are also nearby, including North Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, ETC. You'd have to go to a New York or London to beat this for a week-end get-away. The staff did a nice job, and the price was reasonable, given the good quality. Our college age daughter slept in the adjoining room on a hide-away couch, so if your family is larger than the two of you, it sure beats renting a second room. Highly recommended."
148,176,"Jun 28 2004	Generally Good lodging but lots of kids running around	We just completed a six night stay at the Embassy Suites Lakefront in Chicago. And we found what others had mentioned, expect to have a lot of kids running around. Which for us only presented a problem when we attempted to use the swimming pool for lap swimming. Which was unfortunate as that is one reason we made our reservation at that specific location. Kids were unsupervisied and made a game of getting in our way. And there was never a time when we could use the pool without encountering unsupervised children who had been dropped off at the pool by their parents.The morning breakfast was fine. And you could select either the buffet line or go to the otherside of atrium and have your breakfast made to order. Which was done very quickly. Evening drinks and snacks were exactly that, nothing fancy but not bad. Without exception the staff was very solicitious, helpful, and efficient. The rooms were arranged so as to be particularly quiet for sleeping. But remember to close the door to the bedroom.I would not recommend this lodging if a traveler prefers to avoid an over abundance of young children. But for a family with kids, and a location close to Navy Pier, this could be your place."

159,176,May 6 2003	??????????????
1,178,Apr 4 2009 	Very Enjoyable	I have stayed at this location on numerous occasions. The front desk service has always be exemplary. The people are friendly
2,178,Nov 26 2008 	Very Pleased	I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. I was there for a week at the end of September 2008. The place was as advertised
3,178,Oct 17 2008 	Decent place with little amenities but good value	Extended Stay is rather spartan in furnishings but the rooms are large with full kitchens. Nothing fancy but good price compared to the large hotel (Hampton Inn) next to it. Nothing to exciting but it is in a safe neighborhood in a good accessible location. It is very close to the Old Orchard Shopping Center with many restaurants and shops.	
4,178,Oct 13 2008 	TOTAL DUMP - Do not stay here	This hotel is AWFUL. Do not stay here. The rooms feel dirty
1,188,"Staff Went Above 	While waiting for our guest rooms to become available, hotel desk and housekeeping staff went above &amp; beyond their duties ( and our expectations) to make us comfortable and happy. We didn't get service like this even at the Ritz!"
2,188,"Great location and service	Spent one night at this hotel and enjoyed it. The location is very convenient to everything. Service is excellent. We left our bags with the hotel the following day as we were exploring the city after checkout. They had no problem with this and made it very easy and convenient.The only downside -- paper thin walls. I don't normally complain about noise, but you will be able to hear your neighbors. This was compounded by a very loud group next door. I have to commend the staff as we complained. They got the group next to quiet down immediately. Not sure how they did so, but it was much appreciated. Take earplugs with you, especially if bothered by city noises. Even 12 stories up, you'll be able to hear the street noise.The rooms are very comfortable. Nicely decorated.All in all a good stay for the money. I wouldn't pay the $300 rate given the thin walls. But, at $125, it was well worth it."
3,188,"Nov 12 2009 	Perfect for exploring on foot	Just stayed for 5 nights at the Hampton Majestic - started our break going to Jersey Boys, right next door - what a beautiful theatre! Our room was the quietest we have ever had, and the beds were extraordinary - we slept like logs. Breakfast was surprisingly nice, with great coffee, and then we would set out for the day. Not only could we walk everywhere in the vicinity of the Loop, but stops for all the metro lines, were around the corner. I just don't think the hotel could be more conveniently located. It was our first trip to Chicago, and staying at the Hampton allowed us to make the most of our visit."
4,188,"Nov 11 2009 	good eats	We were traveling in a group of 12 for a fun &quot;Social&quot; Convention: 8 of us stayed at the Hampton &amp; the other 4 stayed at the Convention hotel, the Palmer House across the street. 1st the security is great. the elevator is &quot;keyed&quot; you can get to the lobby but you don't have access to the guestrooms unless you have a room key! the hot breakfast was a surprise. There were 3 of us in the room; we had no problem getting extra towels/soap/coffee/etc. We had the concierge/door man make us reservations at the Italian village &amp; we received a appetizer courtesy of the hotel. (another surprise) What I didn't like: When we check out &amp; split the bill my 2 roommates paid cash, they still &quot;held&quot; my debit card account for the FULL amount of the stay for an entire week (at the end of the week they took the amount owed &amp; took the hold off). I specifically asked the clerk &amp; she said it wouldn't be charged the full amount. Unfortunately I didn't find this out until I was home &amp; checks were bouncing. The hotel would not do anyhting to make it right after the fact."
5,188,"Nov 9 2009 	Location Location Location	Hotel is in a perfect spot downtown. Unless going to the near-north side, walking distance to everything necessary.If looking for a hotel with dining room, room service, or other ammenities, this isn't the place for you, it is after all a Hampton. But, if you want an excellent room, great front desk service, free breakfast and an excellent downtown location there is none better for the cost."
6,188,"Nov 9 2009 	Great weekend in Chicago	Excellent location for our purposes. Room size was excellent for our needs, but would be too small for a family. Staff is helpful and friendly. Our only complaint was that the lighting could have been better."
7,188,"Nov 5 2009 	On Par for Hampton Inn	The Majestic holds up to what I've come to expect from Hampton Inn: comfortable, clean, value, and good service. This was practically our first trip to Chicago so I wasn't exactly sure what part of town would be the best for a hotel. Turns out, the Majestic is in a great location. Easy walk to the Majestic Mile, Hancock Tower, and Navy Pier. Lots of restaurants and stores in the immediate area. The hotel itself was very comfortable in all respects. The lobby (for breakfast) and the rooms have a comfortable decor. The rooms are roomy considering the old building they are adapted to and for being in a large downtown area. I thought the price was very reasonable when compared to other hotels in the area. The breakfast was typical: nothing outstanding but it'll get your day started. If you want a good breakfast, visit one of the &quot;Corner Bakery&quot; restaurants. There are several within a couple blocks of The Majestic.I found out that parking in Chicago (like most cities) is very expensive. There has got to be a more cost effective way of parking your car but the hotel's valet parking was the best I could find on this trip. This is especially true if you want to come and go in your car since valet allows this for the same flat rate. Garage parking will cost you more unless you park it and leave it for 24 hours."
8,188,"Nov 1 2009 	Best Location for Downtown Chicago	This hotel is superb value for the center of Chicago. Located in the Loop, smack in the middle of the theater district, it occupies the upper floors of the Majestic Theater, an art deco high rise. The rooms are reasonably sized and very comfortable, the staff are friendly, helpful and well informed, cleanliness/hygiene is top notch, and it's very quiet, despite the location. The Art Institute, Grant Park and the lake are just a couple of blocks away, and the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot; of Michigan Avenue is an easy walk. Public transportation is readily available to any place in Chicago, and the the Blue Line to O'Hare is just around the corner. The price isn't bargain basement, but for the location, it's great value for money. I'd recommend it to anyone for most any purpose."
9,188,"Oct 27 2009 	Great location -- clean rooms	The Hampton Inn Majestic is located around the corner from the Blue Line which leads to Ohara and is the reason I picked this hotel. It is also centrally located to all the other trains and makes getting around Chicago very easy. Just remember to get a map of the train station at your first ride. We didn't and it made getting around much more difficult. The hotel is connected to a theatre and therefore the lobby is actually on the 4th floor. You must use a key card to access the floors of the hotel with rooms on them. It is an older building and has been well maintained. The rooms are average size and have all the normal amenities of a Hampton Inn. It did face an office building and if you don't close your blinds they can see right into your room.The breakfast was pretty standard -- muffins, cereal, danish, some fruit (in the form of a fruit salad) eggs with ham and cheese, biscuits.Overall it was an enjoyable stay -- the staff was eager to please and the roll a way we requested was delivered within the first 5 minutes we were in the room."
10,188,"Oct 24 2009 	Excellent value base for Chicago	I stayed here for two nights while on business in September. I paid 60/night for a modern, comfortable and spacious room through Expedia (dont bother paying extra for the breakfast rate through Expedia by the way as a free breakfast buffet is available for all guests anyway). The buffet offered quite a good choice with pastries, cereal, fruit, yoghurt and some hot items as well I think. The hotel also offered a business centre (two computers with a printer etc), internet access in the bedrooms and a fitness centre. The location was good  close to the Millennium Park area  and the staff were friendly. Its also close to the Monroe EL stop so easy to get to from the airport (and to get around if youre going further than walking distance)  if you have a lot of luggage though it might be worth walking a bit further from Jackson which has a lift. I was very happy with my choice and would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for the price."
11,188,"Oct 22 2009 	Great experience. Perfect location.	Location, location, location. Found this hotel perfect for our stay. Next door to LaSalle Bank theater, a block from the Italian Village -a few blocks from Union Station. Tight security. The staff were expecially helpful and friendly. The rooms - maybe a little dark - but very clean. The walls must be especially thick (old, historic building) because it was very quiet. No noisy neighbors, no slamming doors. Nice breakfast. Planning another theater trip next May. Will return to the Hampton Majestic."
12,188,"Oct 8 2009 	wonderful experience	We stayed at the Hampton Inn Majestic for 6 nights and I am so glad we chose this hotel. The location is perfect to utilize the CTA, the service is outstanding, the rooms were clean and updated, the breakfast was perfect, and the value for the price was unmatched. I wish all of the Hampton Inn locations could take a lesson from this one. Bravo! We will definitley stay here again the next time we visit Chicago."
13,188,"Oct 7 2009 	Great central location good value in the City	We really liked this hotel. It is in a great location, walk out of the door and you are right in the middle of the theatre district, with easy walking to all the attractions, we did a walking tour of the city and it was a perfect place to start. It is an old renovated building above the theatre, so the lobby is on the first floor. The staff were, without exception, totally charming and helpful. We liked the decor in the rooms, thought them very nicely renovated, and a good size. The beds were extremely comfortable with good linen and a choice of pillows. It was also quiet, we were worried about traffic noise but the double glazing worked well. Breakfast was absolutely fine, and more than enough choice, with fresh fruit. We thought it good value for a city hotel and paid nothing like the rates other reviewers of this place have mentioned, we would certainly stay there again should we ever return to Chicago."
14,188,"Oct 1 2009 	Yes but...	I'd recommend this hotel.Pluses: the location was excellent, the staff friendly, the rooms large, the cost reasonable for a big-city hotel.Neutrals: the breakfast was adequate (but certainly a value compared to buying at a restaurant).Negatives: the rooms were dark. (I don't so much object to the color of the decor, which was maroon-ish, as to the use of fluorescent bulbs in every fixture. Hey, I'm as green as the next guy, but face it, fluorescents cast a cold, dim, gloomy light.) And the common areas were small and dreary. (The entry off the street almost looks like the freight entrance. And the combined front desk/breakfast room/business center was painfully small. For the first couple of days we were there, the presence of two tour groups plus the rest of the guests made breakfast seem like New Year's Eve on Times Square.)All of that said, I do recommend the hotel. But third-best in Chicago? I really don't think so."
15,188,"Sep 29 2009 	Small and Dark	It is convenient, the staff is pleasant, and the internet works well for the business folks. The rooms, however, are dark and very small. I was upgraded so I wonder what the standard room looks like. The carpets are all dark and forboding, the lighting is minimal, and the furniture is all dark. You have to wonder what is lurking. The price was right as well."
16,188,"Sep 21 2009 	Good location and comfortable stay	This hotel is well located in the Theatre District - a short walk from the excellent Millennium Park area and shopping on State street. Rooms looked fairly new and are comfortable. Free breakfast good, as with all Hampton Inns. Friendly staff. Only a few 100 yards from the Monroe train stop - so only $2.25 trip direct from airport (took about 40 minutes)."
17,188,"Sep 18 2009 	Not a great value	I spent 2 nights at Hampton Inn and I am not sure what to say about it. Although there is nothing really bad about it, I cant think of something good to say either. Hampton Inns are usually the inexpensive sister in the Hilton family, nothing fancy, just basic decent hotel accommodation. However, the high price and the very enthusiastic comments from this forum made me believe this is something special. Not exactly. This is a very old building that was probably recently renovated. The colors are all dark however. Dark carpet, dark furniture and dark wall paper, a little to depressing for me. The breakfast is nothing special, just an extended continental breakfast with some kind of fake eggs and gravy, cereals, muffins and beagles. I cant really imagine how someone can eat enough of that stuff to last them till dinner. They offer free wireless Internet and there are 2 PCs in the lobby with free Internet also. The rooms appeared to be clean and comfortable and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, probably they are the best thing about this hotel. I paid $249/ night plus tax and I feel that was no reason for that kind of rate. If you can get this hotel for less than $175 and you dont mind the Gothic look, you might enjoy this hotel more than I did. The location is great especially if you dont have a car and like to walk. In conclusion, not a bad hotel, but definitely not a good value or worth the money that they are asking."
18,188,"Sep 15 2009 	I loved our stay at this hotel! The location was awesome!	If you don't mind walking you can get to almost all the attractions, so have some comfy shoes on. The service was wonderful - people at the front desk were helpful and pleasant. The breakfast was nice,nothing fancy but you can definitely get full easily..I would definitely stay here again! Thank you Majestic."
19,188,"Sep 14 2009 	Service Location 	We look forward to returning to Chicago and will definitely stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly, the room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast included was not the typical toast and coffee and it was in a perfect location. All of this for the most reasonable price of all of the hotels we looked at."
20,188,Sep 12 2009 	Great hotel with perfect location!	My husband and I stayed at the Hampton Inn Majestic for 4 nights and were very pleased with our stay. The room was spacious and beautiful. I heard very little noise from other guests or from the streets. We had no problems with overcrowding at breakfast until Friday morning and I think that was partly because we ate later. You can always take your food to your room if there is not seating available. The location of the hotel is wonderful!! Red line station is right around the corner and there are bus stops that will take you almost anywhere you want to go within about a half a block. Many things were close enough to walk to if you are so inclined. This will be my choice of hotels next time I stay in Chicago.
21,188,"Sep 9 2009 	Excellent Hotel	We were very pleased with this hotel and the staff. Our two-double bed room was very roomy and very clean. The carpeting looked brand-new as did the wallpaper, furniture, etc. Bathroom was a good size with a good shower. Only negative is that the breakfast area is quite small considering the size of the hotel. We choose not to stand-in line to wait for food and what appeared to be a wait for a table. There is a Corner Bakery just a couple of blocks away that was very good and very reasonably priced. We chose to self-park rather than pay for valet parking. We parked at the East Monroe Millennium Parking Garage off of Columbus Avenue ($23/24 hours). Very easy walk from the hotel to the parking garage."
22,188,"Aug 30 2009 	Nice but I would sta somewhere else	My wife and I went to the Hampton Inn Majestic for a quick get away at the end of August. I got a good deal on Jersey Boy tickets by calling the hotel direct and that is why we stayed here. The location is pretty good and hotel was okay but the room decor was a little too dark for my liking. When we arrived the bathroom wasn't as clean as it should have been, it looked as if someone had been sick and the hotel staff didn't fully clean up. Other than that everything else was acceptable. Breakfast was better than your normal continental deal and saved us some money as we were able to skip lunch and eat an early dinner which was also a little cheaper. Overall, our stay was good but I don't see us staying here again."
23,188,"Aug 30 2009 	A lovely stay in an ideal location	We just spent five nights at the Hampton Majestic ,and it deserves the reviews it gets here, particularly for extraordinary value. The rooms are quite large and well-appointed, if a bit dark, and there's none of the noise problem you sometimes get with older hotels. With our very late arrival, we got a room next to the elevator lobby, which is usually a big red flag for us. I promised my wife the minute we heard anything, we'd ask for another room. In five days, we never heard a sound. The desk staff is nonstop pleasant and helpful, and the maid service is the best we've ever experienced -- thorough, unobtrusive and relentlessly cheerful. They even provide two different kinds of pillows, firm and soft. All the details are covered. And you couldn't ask for a better location -- easy walking distance from Millenium Park, theaters, State Street and the Magnificent Mile, some of the world's best restaurants and the Blue Line train to the airport. The breakfast buffet is limited in selection, but everything's delicious. There's no restaurant or bar on site, but the famous Italian Village around the corner provides room service, and Lou Malnati's delivers. The only quibbles are minor -- the small workout room has only one universal weight machine, and the soda vending machines on alternate floors are one-armed bandits. Again, what's remarkable here is the value. Our whole stay cost less than $800, not counting the room taxes. We couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable experience at a place charging three times as much."
24,188,"Aug 23 2009 	Excellent customer service clean rooms great location!	Every minute of our stay was nice and easy from the moment we arrived, the valet folks were so nice and helpful! The rooms are clean and decorated very nicely, doesn't feel like a standard hotel room. The hot breakfast and coffee all day is definitely a perk. Good location in the theatre district. I will say if you want to be right on the magnificent mile, it is a bit of a walk from here. That was fine for us, but I know not so fine for everyone. Upon our checkout, we were allowed to leave our bags with the valet so we could have lunch and walk around the city some more. Would definitely visit again!"
25,188,Aug 21 2009 	Great customer service!!!	Great location if you're going to the Majestic Theatre. Magnificant Mile and State Street shoping just a couple of blocks away. If you like Italian food you MUST vist the Italian Village restaurant just one block down the street.
26,188,"Aug 19 2009 	Great location great hotel.	We had a great stay at the Majestic. Perfect location, close to all trains and within walking distance to all downtown attractions. Staff attentive and friendlly. We didn't have breakfast while we were there but it sounded good. Room was spacious, super clean and modern. We appreciate all the ammenities such as free Wifi and plasma TV, and daily paper. Bed was very comfy. Only negative was small closet. We spent a little extra for the room with microwave/fridge and it was perfect for leftovers from many fabulous dining experiences in Chicago. Easy trip on orange line from Midway airport and blue/red lines just around the corner. We were next to the elevator but didn't hear any noise from it or neighbors, just some street noise which is normal for Chicago. Great stay! Go cubbies!"
27,188,"Aug 17 2009 	Fabulous Hotel...Wonderful Staff...	.stayed here with our two teenagers and we all absolutely loved this hotel. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, the staff were always very helpful and accessible.Front door valet parking for one flat free for your stay. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for them to retrieve our car.The rooms were very large and spacious with wonderful high ceilings. You never felt cramped in this room. Beds were very comfortable, towels were thick and plentiful.Free wi-fi in our room which worked very fast. The continental breakfast included was great - hot items such as eggs and ham were available along with a good selection of cereals, fresh fruits, pastries and breads.The location is ideal. We were able to walk most places after receiving directions from the friendly lobby staff including the aquarium. It wasn't that far at all. We did take the subway one night and it is conveniently located around the corner from the hotel.There are a lot of great stores near the hotel for shopping as well there is a theater right next door to take in a Broadway show.We had a great time in Chicago and couldn't have asked for a better hotel to stay at."
28,188,"Aug 15 2009	wonderful stay	Clean, friendly/helpful staff, and perfect location near buses and trains. Staff was very advising best way to reach places. And free breakfast and internet!"
29,188,"Aug 15 2009	Troublefree stay	Hampton Inn Majestic Chicago Theatre District deserves its high tripadvisor ranking. Comfortable beds, free high speed internet, great shower, working thermostat, plenty of towels, HD TV, comfortable beds, included breakfast, speedy check-in and express check-out made for a trouble free stay. Handy to the 'L' and buses, Union Station Millennium Park, the Art Institute and any number of other attractions are a short walk away. If you want a fancier lobby you can walk down the street through the Palmer House for free."
30,188,"Aug 10 2009 	Great central location good rooms elevators in high demand	This hotel is located inside Chicago's loop, and within walking distance to many downtown attractions and businesses. The rooms are adequate in size, clean and modern, with very tall ceilings, as these floors were likely an offices in the past. Once business hours have passed, there is not much nearby in terms of nightlife except for establishments catering to the theater and tourist crowds, since this is primarily a commercial district with some theaters. Public transportation and taxis are readily available in the area.The breakfast, internet and service is as one would expect from most Hampton Inns, consistently efficient and effective. One drawback to this hotel was the elevator situation during check-in (late afternoon) and check-out (morning). This building is very tall and narrow, there are about 10 rooms per floor, but there are 20+ floors in the building, with only 2 or 3 elevators serving the floors containing the Hampton Inn, so during peak traffic hours, you may have to wait a bit longer than expected. This hotel has no pool, nor free parking.Overall, this is a great value for a hotel situated in the heart of Chicago, if you are on business or leisure, and have a need for this very central location."
31,188,"Aug 10 2009 	Great Value in a Great City	My family and I went to Chicago for Lollapalooza. I was looking for a hotel close to Grant Park so the kids would be able to walk back and forth with their 3 day pass. What a great choice we made. Great location, friendly staff, and nice rooms. This is a very old office building, so don't expect your usual Hampton Inn huge lobby with a vast free parking area. You are literally in the middle of downtown Chicago, so expect to pay a premium for that. The kids enjoyed Lollapalooza, my wife and I enjoyed touring the city, and we also enjoyed some great restaurants."
32,188,"Aug 6 2009 	super friendly staff	Our family chose this hotel because of its high rating on Trip Advisor and the not-outrageous price/night. It had its flaws, but for the most part, this was a fine place to stay.The staff was SO courteous and always willing to help with whatever we needed. We had never been to Chicago before and they were helpful with directions to a few places. Also, whenever we had extra towels or anything else brought up to our room, the person was always telling us to call anytime and he would get anything we needed right away. The parking guys downstairs were also very friendly and when we had to wait 15 minutes for our car to be brought to us, they were super apologetic, even though we expected at least that long of a wait.There was a flat screen, HD tv that was nice.Breakfast was good. Selection was pretty good. Hot items and cold.Walking distance to downtown stuff. MANY restaurants very nearby. We walked to the Sears Tower too. Took a short (somewhat scary) cab ride to the Field Museum and Aquarium. Wi-fi worked very well.Room was super clean.Things I would change...It would have been nice to have a second sink outside of the bathroom.The closet was super tiny.Bedside table was really small.Pillows were too &quot;high&quot;. Wish we would have been given flatter ones.The TV channel selection was small... no Disney channel or Nickelodeon for the kids."
33,188,Jul 27 2009 	Lovely	The location can not be beat (nor can the friendliness of the staff!!!). Great time. Chicago has been the best part of our vacation in the US.
34,188,"Jul 20 2009 	Oh What a Night 	Hey, considering the hit show Jersey Boys is playing right next door, I thought I'd keep with the songs in the show: Oh, What a Night &amp; Oh, What a Hotel!Had a conference last week--and didn't want to stay too close to all of the conference hoopla, so I chose to stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic &amp; I'm glad I did!This place has it all: Decent room rates, friendly staff (front desk, bellmen, breakfast bar); very nice free breakfast; FREE Internet; and the front desk was kind enough to give me a late check-out!Also good: Being next door to Jersey Boys! That show ROCKED! Get this: You can get &quot;RUSH&quot; tickets for $25 bucks the same day as the show...The bellman advised me to get there at 8:30am for a 10am opening &amp; it worked....Just take a good book to read for the 90 minute waitThe hotel is clean &amp; well-maintained....Also, the hotel is relatively close to everything--Mill, Park, shopping, restaurants, etc.Thank you for 5 lovely days!"
35,188,"Jul 18 2009 	Looks Can Deceive!	When you first look at the outside entrance to this hotel, you could be forgiven for thinking that it isn't up to much on the inside. Nothing could further from the truth!The hotel is actually on top of the Theatre of America, and the hotel lobby is accessed via elevators at the 4th floor.You are welcomed by a small but friendly and efficent lobby area. The staff are very efficient and extremely friendly and always available to give help and assistance when needed. The lobby also contains a breakfast area where complimentary breakfasts are served every morining with a fair selection of hot and cold food. The breakfast area can become a little busy at times but it usually doesn't take long before a table becomes available. Also in the lobby is a small Business Centre where there are two computer terminals and a printer available.High-speed internet access is available throughout the hotel free of charge via wi-fi or ethernet cable.Our room was on the 11th floor and situated at the rear of the hotel away from the main street. There was minimal street noise with only the occasional siren from emergency services vehicles; this meant that we were able to get a good nights sleep. The room was adequately sized with a king-sized bed, work-desk, easy chair, computer chair, chest of drawers and built-in wardrobe. Also provided was a 32&quot; HD flat-screen tv with a host of channels including a fair number of HD channels.The bathroom was very good and contained all modern conveniencies and plenty of towels. Also situated in the bathroom was the coffee maker with plenty of sachets.The bed was extremely comfortable, especially after a hard day walking around the city!The only gripe we had was that on a couple of occasions we found that the room-maid still hadn't made up the room by late afternoon; a little inconvenient if you were wanting to take a shower etc before dinner! Never-the-less the service was first class!On one particular day it had been raining during the morning and we didn't have an umbrella; we noticed another guest had been given a complimentary umbrella for the rest of his visit. So, we asked for one too and was handed one for our stay. Needless to say it never rained again for the rest of our stay!!The hotel is situated on W. Monroe, right around the corner form State Street and the beginning of all the shops. Millenium Park is three blocks away which is also the beginning of the 'Magnificent Mile'. So as you can see, the Hampton Inn Majestic is close to all the action you could require and a theatre an open door away! We would thoroughly reccomend this hotel for a quiet and not too expensive stay!"
36,188,"Jul 14 2009 	FRIENDLY	My husband and I were very impressed with the Hampton. Awesome guest service (Cynthia) clean,quiet, perfect location. And we will be back for sure."
37,188,"Jul 8 2009 	Great location for family with teens!	Just got back from Chicago. We were very pleased with our stay at The Hampton Inn. It's clean and quiet, and the rooms are tastefully decorated. The breakfast buffet has plenty to offer two hungry teens (and their parents!), and the 24-hour coffee and tea service in the lobby is nice to have. The hotel is ideally located near the Art Institute and Mill. Park."
38,188,"Jul 8 2009 	Great Location Great Price	Stayed one night in the middle of the week at the Hampton Inn Majestic while traveling for work. The hotel was extremely clean and had a very old Chicago feel to it which was neat. The room was a little smaller which was fine by me and understandable considering the downtown location. Even though the building was older, the room was neat and had a contemporary look to it. As in all Hamptons, the room also had free internet access. The room also had a high definition 42 LCD TV which was nice. The view from my room wasnt anything special but that part didnt really matter to me.My only complaint was that there was no soap anywhere in the room and I had to go to the front desk to get some. Not the end of the world though. All in all, it was a nice hotel with a great location and very reasonably priced. Would definitely stay there again."
39,188,Jul 7 2009 	Awesome! Definitely going back!	The location is very convenient. If you are coming from the airport the blue line stops right outside of the hotel. The rooms are very clean and are kept that way each day by the housekeeping staff. The hotel is close to all Chicago's important sites and has some great restaurants in the area. The staff is friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that breakfast is served in the small lobby so if there are a lot of guests there at the same time it can get a bit hectic. There are 2 computers and a printer in the lobby which was very convenient. Very reasonable prices for the location and rooms. I'll definitely be staying there on my next trip to Chicago!
40,188,"Jul 5 2009 	Great place - great location - wonderful staff	Just around the corner from the Monroe El stop (a bargain at $2.50 USD direct from Chicago O'Hare Airport) this renovated hotel was perfect; free breakfast included hot eggs, biscuits, toast, bagels, sweet rolls, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, juices, coffee, etc.Staff was friendly &amp; efficient. Walked to Art Institute of Chicago, Grant &amp; Millenium Parks, Magnificent Mile. Safe and clean, family friendly."
41,188,"Jul 3 2009 	All the best plus more	Just returned from an overnight stay at the Hampton Inn. Being a travel agent we relyon tripadvisor quite a bit to get the reviews of the different hotels. While checking prices and the ratings for a one night stay I came across the Hampton Inn-Majestic.It lived up to the great reviews and more. The staff at this hotel are GEMS! They are veryhelpful and knowledgeable. More, when you make special requests..............they deliver.So many resorts spout that they request things but can't guarantee. Hampton Inndelivered!"
42,188,"Jun 30 2009 	Fantastic Stay	Last week my girlfriends and I spent three wonderful days at the Hampton Inn Majestic for shopping, sightseeing, and theater. The hotel was wonderful and the location was great. We only needed a taxi to and from the train station.The employees at the front desk are pleasant and helpful, especially Christopher who made our reservations and offered several recommendations. The complimentary breakfast is hot, yummy, and fresh. Each day, Martha in food service greeted us with a smile and a &quot;good morning&quot;. She kept the food trays well stocked and the coffee hot.The Hampton Inn Majestic will be our hotel of choice in Chicago."
43,188,"Jun 23 2009 	A Very Pleasant Surprise!	Had never heard of the Hampton Majestic but figured the #2 ranking from TripAdvisor made it worth a try. Great location in the heart of The Loop, and close to both the Red and Blue CTA lines so connecting to O'Hare and Wrigley Fields was a snap. Clean, quiet comfortable room. Complimentary breakfast buffet was tasty, comprehensive, and varied over the two days of my stay. Staff was universally friendly and helpful. What more can one want?I'll be back..."
44,188,"Jun 17 2009 	Hampton Inn Majestic is well worth it!	I traveled to Chicago with my family for 6 nights. We were very pleased with our stay here at the Majestic! The staff was very helpful and always willing to help us out! We did come back to the hotel about 3 o'clock one day and the roon had not been cleaned but that was the ONLY issue we had. The rooms were very comfortable and the location couldn't be better. You have the blue line on one side of the building, the red on the other. And an added bonus...Garrett's Popcorn is a very short walk away!!!"
45,188,"Jun 16 2009 	Clean room very good services great location	We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. My wife liked the hotel because of the overall cleanliness. During the stay, she and my son did not get stuffy nose. In most hotels we have stayed at, the HVAC systems usually got the nose of her or my son stuffy. But not at this hotel. The room was large for 3 people. Our room had two queen sized beds, which were huge and comfortable. The beds were not hard and not too soft. The comforters and pillows were clean and comfortable. The room had a huge flat screen LCD TV with the usual channels. The one complaint I had was that the housekeeping maid did not leave us with enough hand towels, any cups and any spare roll of toilet paper in the second day. I called the front desk to lodge a complaint. The manager, Andrew, called me back and took care of the problems with a sincere apology. I was impressed with how well the management handled my complaint. A minor concern I had was the huge, old, wood-framed windows, which did not offer good sound insulation. As a result, I could hear honking noises made by cars at night (our room was on the 10th floor). The honking noises were not too loud, but noticeable. Luckily the honking noises did not prevent my family from falling asleep. Other than the faint honking noises, I could hear water running when our next door neighbors took their shower. But that kind of shower noises from the rooms next door is a common thing in many hotels that I have stayed at, and is not a problem unique to this hotel. However, I was impressed by the fact that I did not hear any noise through the walls from the rooms on both sides of our room indicating that the walls did a very good job in noise insulation. In addition, I did not hear any noises from the hallway during my stay. I think the fact that there were only 8 rooms per floor reduced the number of people staying on each floor and as a result reducing the chance of hallway noises. The room had a pair of thick, burgundy curtains at the windows, which curtains did a very good job in keeping the room dark in the morning. The free buffet breakfast was quite well stocked with a hot meat item and an egg item every morning. The breakfast dining room was, unfortunately, kind of tight so it was crowded every morning. Nevertheless, on the overall, I am very happy with the hotel stay here. Finally, the location of the hotel is great: less than a block from the Red Line or Green Line, only about 3 blocks from Millenium Park and about 8 blocks from the Chicago River. The central location of the hotel is a big plus."
46,188,Jun 1 2009 	Great Service	Great service from start to finish - we came to Chicago over Labor Day weekend and when we got there the gentleman at the entrance checked to see if our room was ready - the rooms were beautiful and very cozy. They called us after we got to our room to make sure that the room was good and to see if we needed anything. There complimentary breakfast was one of the best my family and I have ever seen they even have &quot;on the go&quot; bags filled with goodies in case you are on the run.
47,188,"May 28 2009 	OK place to stay.	Great location if you are seeing a show at the Bank of America Theatre. Our room was nice and very quiet. Breakfast was decent but the lobby area is small so it can be crowded.. Housekeeping service was very good although I prefer my room cleaned early. When we came back to our room at 1:00 pm to get ready for a show, our rooms were not clean and we had no clean towels. The biggest negative for me was the front desk staff. They were a terrible source for information on restaurants, tours and directions. You would think the least they would do is tell us they had brochures on the fifth floor. We happened upon them while searching for a vending machine for water. Our floor, 9th, did not have a vending machine for drinks. Also, only one of our room keys was activated and you need the key to get the elevator going.. We booked two rooms and the other couple had the same problem. This is a good place to stay if you are seeing a show but I would not stay here again as Chicago has many great hotels."
48,188,"May 26 2009 	Lived up to its great reviews . . . now here's mine	If you're looking for a room with great views of the lake or a fancy lobby, don't stay here. However, if you're looking for an extremely clean room in a nice building, with great service from the minute you walk into the place, perfectly situated between the red and blue lines, and at a great price compared to other area hotels, with a pretty good free breakfast, then stay here. If you plan on seeing Jersey Boys (which I highly recommend) then staying here is an added bonus for convenience. I just returned from a five night stay there and could not have been more pleased with the Hampton Majestic. I chose this hotel partly because I did want to see Jersey Boys a few times, partly because of the reviews, largely for proximity to subway access and largely for the great rate I got (average of $109 per over the five nights). The front desk people were great. Of note when I checked out at 1:30 in the morning to catch an early flight, the girl at the front desk (on 5/26) actually went and got the keys to turn on the juice machine in the breakfast area just so I could have a glass of juice before I left. Small thing but incredibly thoughtful. There's no restaurant other than the very good breakfast buffet, but no problem. There's more than you need just outside the hotel (my favorite was Italian Village). The rooms were average size, nice size bathrooms, both very nice and clean. Free in-room internet service and computers and printer for use in the lobby helped too; and a nice big flat screen tv in the room. There's a fair amount of street traffic noise below, expected though for an area like that, but seems to die down by 10:00 pm or so. More importantly, it was very quiet inside the hotel, and I noticed security making rounds at night, plus a card key required to use the elevator at any time and to enter the building after 10 or 11 PM. Would like to have seen an actual safe in the room, but otherwise felt very safe. Being so close to the blue and red lines make it a straight shot to/from O'Hare on the blue (much quicker and cheaper than a taxi) and to Wrigley Field and White Sox Park on the red. Easy walk to Lake M. too. This would have been a bargain at twice the price I paid. Next time I go to Chicago, I won't even waste time checking other hotels, this place is a great bargain in a perfect location."
49,188,"May 23 2009 	Chicago's hidden secret	Just returned form a stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic. We have been to the city many times and stayed at many hotels. Most of them in the 4 star category. We stayed here as we were helped with out reservation by those assisting us in our trip this time. I read the reviews and saw the pictures on line. So I expected a nice 2 star hotel. The Hampton Majestic proved to be way above my expectations. The staff was wonderful, friendly and helpful. The room was nice size, extremely clean. The bed were great. The bathroom was big and the shower was great. It was quiet as others have mentioned before. It might not have had bathrobes like some of the more expensive hotels but otherwise was equal to or exceded what we had found at other hotels.We usually try and stay at a different hotel each time we go to the city, but I tell you this is the only hotel we will use in the future. Like I said for the price it is Chicago's best kept secret."
50,188,"May 23 2009 	The Majestic lives up to its name	We stayed on a Friday and Saturday night. From the moment we pulled over to the curb, we were greeted with friendliness and excellent service. We were early and our bags were held until we came back to check-in. The valet and bell employees were extremely polite and helpful. I was a bit nervous being in the big city alone with my 11 year old daughter, and everyone put us at ease. We walked everywhere! Great access to Millenium Park, shopping and the Cadillac Theater. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated. The room was quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was very good and varied and the staff were so friendly. We asked a lot of questions about riding the &quot;red line&quot; and we made it to Michigan Avenue. We hope we can stay at the Majestic again sometime soon."
51,188,"May 21 2009 	Will Go Back	Very pleasant hotel with excellent and friendly staff. The room was large and well appointed. The complimentary buffet breakfast provide an excellent start and was available for quite a while which meant there was no rush. The location was convenient for the theatres and not far from Michigan Ave. It was also very handy for the subway to O'Hare and Wrigley field with the Sears Tower being only a 10 minute walk. It was an enjoyable stay. Will stay here again if we and when I go back to Chicago, a great city."
52,188,"May 18 2009 	Fantastic stay	After an 8 hour flight from Dublin, the welcomes and the smiles from the staff in the Hampton Inn were great. The check in was very smooth, we got maps and information on local dining and bars. Everyone in the hotel was so freindly, helpful and polite - a great asset to the hotel. The hotel is very centrally located with State St shops around the corner, great bars and restuarants and the lake side and 'Bean' only a short walk away. If you want some good food and genuine hospitality head off to Millers bar, a block way - Karl the barman is great company and the food was great. The best cheesburger any of us ever ate was in Butch McGuires on Division St - a typical Irish American bar with lots of food, music and people. We had some great Thai food in the Big Bowl on 60 EAst Ohio St if you fancy something spicier. Taxis were very cheap and we used them regulalrly, we also got a 24 hour visitor pass for the trains/buses and that was good value.I highly recommend going on the 90 minute river/lake cruise - we bought the tickets at the pier near the Wrigley Building and only paid $25 for teh trip - cheaper than the CAM tours and just as interesting. You really get a feel for this great city from the water.I would definitely recommend the Hampton Inn and will be returning to Chicago - a great city to visit"
53,188,"May 17 2009 	Wish it were cheaper but what a great place!	The Hampton Inn Majestic was located perfectly for purposes of our recent trip to Chicago... within easy walking distance of the Ford Theatre (where we saw LEGALLY BLONDE), of an office where I had business to do, of the Art Institute of Chicago, and of both the Red and Blue lines of the train, which made getting to the hotel from the airport by train INCREDIBLY easy, inexpensive, and fast compared to taking a taxi in.I want to say that we were hard pressed to make a decision between this hotel and the Homewood Suites which are also so highly rated here at TripAdvisor... and which, from the reviews, have a GREAT breakfast and lots of space, including a full kitchen. Even better, we were able to find an online room rate of $139 for the Homewood Suites, which is a great price for that hotel... but in the end, with very little to go on in deciding between the two, my husband and I selected the Hampton Inn Majestic for two reasons... one, because it really was the best situated hotel for the business we had to do in town... and two, because the Homewood Stay Suites reviews all (or mostly) seemed to be from families traveling with children. I don't dislike kids, but I have had too many experiences when traveling of kids not being well-supervised in hotels by parents who understandably want to relax and enjoy their own well-deserved vacations.... and regretably for other travelers in hotels, this often means having children pounding up and down hotel hallways outside your door at all hours, yelling and chasing each other early in the morning... slamming in and out of rooms with loud, self-closing doors repeatedly.... handling food at breakfast buffets without washing hands, etc. I have seen NO indications in reviews for the Homewood Suites that this is the case or the norm at that hotel! But I couldn't find any reviews from people who weren't themselves traveling with children, so I wasn't sure I was seeing reviews from travelers with my own perspective. So, regretfully, we passed on Homewood Suites and reserved with Hampton Inn Majestic.I searched and searched, but could not find a rate less than $199 a night for the time we'd be there... my husband and I are not &quot;luxury hotel&quot; people, and prefer not to blow more than $100 a night of vacation budgets on lodging...but in the end decided that the location and the good reviews might justify the expense.We were not disappointed. I realize that every hotel review is subjective, and that everyone's personal experience is dictated by a number of unpredictable factors... but all I can do is tell you what we experienced.We were given a room on the 8th floor. Elevator access to room floors is controlled by your room key, which is a nice added security measure in downtown Chicago. Our room was a good size. Walls are a darkish rust color, which made for a darker room than I generally like, but color doesn't matter that much to me. The most important thing to me in ANY hotel room is whether or not the bed is comfortable.These beds were terrific. Not too soft, not too hard; didn't wake up with aching backs.The second most important thing to me in a hotel room is room temperature. The thermostat in our room was easy to understand, immediately responsive, and let you set a specific temperature and maintain it automatically rather than force you to rely on vague &quot;warmer/cooler&quot; dials that required you to constantly adjust a dial up or down.The third most important thing to me in a hotel room is quiet. Our room was wonderfully quiet for all four nights of our stay. We didn't hear doors slamming in the morning, or plumbing from other rooms. We didn't hear other people's TVs, or hair dryers, or conversations. We didn't hear conversations out in the hallway. I'm pretty sure there were at least three other people staying on our floor, because newspapers would be outside those doors in the mornings... either we lucked out and stayed on a floor with some very courteous fellow travelers, or these rooms are just well sound-proofed.The shower heads are very high... my 6-foot-tall husband was thrilled not to have to crouch to wash his hair. I'm a bit shorter, and had to adjust the shower spray to ensure that there'd still be some force to the water by the time it hit my reduced height. :-)The included breakfast was okay, not spectacular... but it did include hot items (scrambled egg discs and ham discs) as well as breads and a variety of cereals, juices, milk, etc. I would have liked to have waffles as an option.The business center was TERRIFIC. I was able to check email and print boarding passes, as one would expect, but ALSO to download and print some Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF documents, which is not always possible in a hotel business center.There are lots of dining options within walking or easy train ride distance. We ate at the Grillroom across the street (WONDERFUL flourless chocolate cake there!!!), at Petterino's within walking distance of the Ford Theatre, and at the Weber Grille (an easy ride on the red line). All were great.The Hampton Inn Majestic staff, though we had limited interaction with them, were very friendly and helpful throughout. We regretfully decided to check out a night early because our flight home was going to be very early in the morning, and the train's Blue Line was going to be undergoing repairs over the weekend that would force us to take the train part of the way, then take a shuttle, then get back on the train... and we couldn't face the uncertainty and possible delays on the morning of an early flight. We decided to spend the last night in the Chicago Hilton at O'Hare, and did not have nearly as wonderful an experience there as we did at this Hampton Inn (which, I believe, is also a Hilton property?). I have also posted a review about our experience at that hotel, if you're interested.In summary, if this hotel is as well-located for you as it was for us, you can't go wrong. Sure wish it were cheaper... but it's not outrageous for a hotel in downtown Chicago, and you definitely get good hotel value for the money."
54,188,"May 13 2009 	EXCELLENT STAFF AND LOCATION	The staff was excellent!! The location was excellent!! A wonderful breakfast was included. Walking distance to several area attractions. We also used the trolley service that was located one block form us. We saw the broadway hit, Jersey Boys, which was right next door!! Everything was great!!! We had a great stay!!! Beds were very comfortable!!! We are planning to return later this summer."
55,188,"May 13 2009 	Fantastic hotel in a fabulous location in an amazing city!!	Absolutely loved Chicago! Arrived home in the early hours of this morning and even though jet lagged wanted to get this review on here asap!! We couldn't of asked to be in a better location. Arrived at O'Hare no problems at all and as recommended on TA we braved the 'L'. So glad we did - we did not stop using it. We arrived at T5 and signposts to the train station were good - we then brought a 7 day CTA pass for the 'L' (inc use of CTA buses too) for $26 each (they also do 1 and 3 day passes).  We found this to be great value for money as the cost of our two passes, which we used all week would have been about the price of a taxi one way!! Can't recommend it enough as the subway locations for the blue and red line are both just around the corner from the hotel so no problem at all. They seemed to be very reliable too and very frequent! It was useful as we could walk all the way some where and know we could hop on the 'L' to get back to the hotel!Also useful if you want to take in a Sox (or Cubs) game as the L takes you straight there. I'm not a big sports fan but the baseball is so much fun to watch and very entertaining - definitely recommend it. We saw the White Sox play and got tickets on the day (I believe the cubs tickets are a lot harder to come by!!)The hotel itself is in a lovely building, rooms were of a good size and clean, staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a high floor room (18th) and we were not bothered by any street or other guest noise (apart from the odd slamming door!!) The breakfast included was fine for what it was - buffet style - you could fill up on fruit, toasts, bagels, juice, cakes and there was also a small hot option. Coffee was availble all day in the lobby which was most welcome after a day of sightseeing!!As for Chicago itself we did all the usual tourist things but have to say the highlights for us (apart from the fantastic shopping!) was the Chicago Trolley tour - great to get your bearings, Sears Tower, drinks at night for the view at the top of the Hancock Tower and the Shedd Aquarium (you have to see the 4D Planet Earth show!!!). Food was great and we had a particularly good dinner at The Gage opposite the Millenium Park and only a short walk from the Hotel. Millenium Park is great to stroll around and we thought the Bean was amazing - so many photo opportunities!!Almost forgot our other highlight was bumping into Jerry Springer walking around Chicago!My only regret.....we did not take advantage of seeing the Jersey Boys in the theatre next to the Hotel!"
56,188,"May 8 2009 	Almost perfect...one major problem.	Not wanting to attempt driving/parking in downtown Chicago, my two friends and I booked at the Majestic while we were in town for a girls' weekend. The location is very nice...just a few blocks from the Art Institute, though it's about a mile and change hike to the Museums and the Lake. The lobby's on the 4th floor...the hotel doesn't even 'start' until the 4th floor, so that took some getting used to. The staff was fantastic, the rooms were spacious and scrumptious, and the price + valet parking, while still pricey, was FAR better than any other downtown Chicago hotel.So, what was the major problem? We arrived early, about 1030am, in town, stopping for lunch before we went to the hotel. We got to the hotel a little before 2pm and were told that the room wasn't ready yet...okay. 3pm's check-in time, no biggie. We checked our luggage with the wonderful valet staff (though they had to even tag our pillows!), and set out to wander the town a little. We wound up hiking out to the Museum Campus and back. Upon returning, we figured we'd go and drop things off in the room, then go to dinner.But the room still wasn't ready and our luggage was still down in the valet station. It was 530pm. We were a bit travel-weary and a bit footsore, and we wound up sitting in the lobby for another half-hour while the room was finished. The desk clerk explained that they had a 'full turnover', as in, everyone had checked out that morning and every room had to be cleaned, but still, having to wait 3 full hours past our check-in time irked us, especially in our tired and hungry conditions. Then, once we were checked in, we were not allowed to bring our own luggage up; we had to wait for the bellhop. After a 25min wait (after being told it would only be 5-10min), we had to call the front desk to remind them to send it up. As a result, we didn't get out of the hotel until well past intended time and were faced with the hordes of Saturday night diners swarming Chicago.If not for that, this would have been a perfect experience and we would stay here again, but I suggest that if the housekeeping staff is that overextended, perhaps they should hire on another person or two. Just a suggestion.Otherwise, great stay at a nice hotel!"
57,188,"Apr 28 2009 	Great Stay at Hampton Inn Majestic	My husband, son and I recently stayed at the Hampton Inn Majestic and we were very pleased with our experience. The hotel was very well located, downtown and right around the corner from two train lines. This is not a luxury, fancy, hotel but a comfortable, friendly &quot;home away from home&quot;. Our room was clean and nicely decorated with very comfortable beds. The free breakfast and internet were convenient and much appreciated. All of the hotel employees were so friendly and ready to assist us at any time. If I had to think of a negative, the only one that comes to mind is that we could hear some street noise from inside our room but it was not loud enough to be annoying or disturb our sleep. We definitely hope to return."
58,188,"Apr 23 2009 	A GREAT hotel in central Chicago	I stayed at the Hampton Majestic for a week over Easter 2009. I initially chose it because it was very reasonably priced and seemed central...but it exceeded my expectations by a long way. The room was wonderful - great colour scheme (recently renovated so everything was sparkling clean), possibly the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on, good internet access, seamless service. The breakfast was quite simple but more than enough to start a big day of sight seeing. The gym was small but well fitted out and the free bottled water was an unexpected bonus. ALL the staff were helpful and friendly - and having The Jersey Boys playing downstairs in the same building was the icing on the cake! I would go back tomorrow! (all that was missing for a long stay was a fridge and microwave in the room)"
59,188,Apr 4 2009 	Nice hotel for a weekend getaway	Some friends &amp; I stayed here recently for a weekend getaway. The room was very clean &amp; contemporary. The bathroom was nice. The front desk clerk was courteous &amp; gave dinner suggestions. The bellmen stored our bags as we arrived into town early in the day. The location is convenient to downtown attractions. We enjoyed our stay.
60,188,"Apr 2 2009 	Blow Me Away Chicago! Girlfriends Getaway	This was a first visit to Chicago for each of us (group of 4) and we had a great time! We went there primarily to see the Broadway Musical &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; and decided to get reservations at the Hampton Inn Majestic which was adjacent to the theater. We didn't even have to step outside (in the cold rain and wind) to enter the theater, because there was an entrance from inside the hotel. How convenient! The hotel itself was nice, although I've stayed in much nicer for less money. But, the room was very clean and the beds were comfy and we were only in our room long enough to sleep; we spent most of each day taking advantage of all this great city had to offer! We were all VERY IMPRESSED by the friendly, accomodating staff. From the moment we stepped into the hotel and was met by our very gracious doorman to the young women overseeing the continental breakfast each morning, we were made to feel like royalty! They genuinely seemed interested in making our stay as pleasant as possible. Also, the continental breakfast was one of the best I've ever seen. A nice selection of hot food and pastry items, as well as cereals and fruit. There were about 4 or 5 juice choices as well as 3 choices in coffee and hot water available for hot cocoa. Also, the food was replenished as needed and if you came down 15 minutes before the end of the allotted time for breakfast, there would still be plenty of food available. So, when you consider the great breakfast and the great service, I had no problem with the price of the room which was around $140 per night. The lobby was comfortable, with a couple of couches, chairs and several tables (seating 4-6 people). They also had a small business center with a couple of complimentary computers and free internet. There was an exercise room, but we didn't take the time to check it out. I thought the location of the hotel was just perfect. We were able to walk to the Art Institute, the Park, the fabulous shopping, great restaurants and managed quite well. I have a mild disability, but was able to tolerate the walking without much of a problem. It is so easy to hail a cab whenever you need one. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn Majestic to anyone visiting Chicago to go to the theater or to take advantage of the fabulous shopping. We got a cab from Midway Airport to the Hamton Inn Majestic and it cost about $25 (not counting the tip), which was split between the four of us. I can't imagine anyone not liking this hotel and its' location! When I make another trip to Chicago (and I will), I will try to get reservations at the Hampton Majestic before even considering another hotel."
61,188,Mar 23 2009 	Absolutely Fantastic!!	This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. The rooms are beautiful with all the amenities you expect in a Hampton. The staff is very helpful. &quot;Peter the Great&quot; Bellman is so cool and so helpful! We love him. Thanks to all the staff for the great service abd a great stat in the Windy City.
62,188,"Mar 20 2009 	Great hotel great location!	This hotel has a great location and is close to everywhere. The rooms were really nice, with a very comfy bed, nice TV, nice decoration, really nice bathroom and most of all - they were very quiet, so you sleep like a baby. Another great feature of the hotel is free wireless interent. The only thing I was a bit disappointed was the room service, which is provided by the restaurant near the hotel. On the other side it does force you to go out and explore the fantastic city and try the Chicago pizza:) If you are looking for a nice hotel in the centre of Chicago - you have found it!"
63,188,Mar 12 2009 	Loved every minute of it	We love this hotel. We have stayed here two years in a row. GREAT breakfasts. Helpful front desk staff. The doormen are always knowledgeable and pleasant. Unique hotel being part of the Theatre building. Right around the corner from a Red line stop. Down the street from the Gray Line tours pick up point. Also liked the computers for use in the lobby in case you want to look anything up.
64,188,"Mar 1 2009 	Excellent Location Nice Hotel!	This hotel is bang in the center of everything worthwhile in Chicago, expecially the theatre district. The hotel is literally bolted on to one. I saw the musical, &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;. Excellent!The rooms are big and bright. The breakfast is more than big enough. Buses and the underground are literally across the street or around the corner. There are many shops and restaurants nearby.Sears Tower is close by too. It is in the center of &quot;The Loop&quot;."
65,188,"Feb 18 2009 	The ONLY place to stay in downtown Chicago!!!	We got a great rate at this hotel ($130.00 total) for Saturday night (Valentines Day) and we are glad we chose to stay here. This hotel does not have the fancy entryway/foyer area, but oh my.....What a wonderfully decorated room. This room was newly remodeled, with very current and new furniture, fresh paint and even a flat screen 40 inch HD TV!!!!! We have stayed at many downtown hotels and have never had a room this &quot;roomy&quot;!! We had a king room and it was huge for downtown. This room and hotel is going to he our #1 choice from here on out, what a gem! There is a Rosebud Prime around the corner and also a Rosebud Italian restaurant a block away, both great eats!! If you are going to stay downtown for a romantic getaway, look no further.......Hampton Inn Downtown Majestic is THE place to stay, hands down!! Hampton Inn.........You have yourself a gem here!!"
66,188,"Feb 8 2009 	Excellent Value	I stayed at this hotel for five nights from December 25th through December 30th, 2008. I was with my wife and two sons (ages 17 &amp; 20), and we had two rooms. The average price was $119 per night per room. This included breakfast and free internet (free wireless and two free computers in the lobby). When we checked out, the only charges on the bill were room and tax, plus $38 per night for valet parking. Just the price and the location made this hotel a good buy. However, it was also nicely appointed, the breakfast was good, and the staff was helpful. We saw two shows (Wicked and Dirty Dancing), and were within easy walking distance to both theatres. We were also within easy walking distance of the art museum, the Magnificent Mile, Millennium Park and Macys. I noticed in some reviews some complaints about the price of parking. For the location, the price is pretty good, actually. Parking in the Loop is just plain expensive. Alsoit seems to be on the Mayors plans to make it even more expensive in the near future. Still, it was a lot cheaper than flying (from Columbus, Ohio) four of us there.Anyway, we completely enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay there again."
67,188,"Feb 8 2009 	Outstanding Hotel	My daughters and I stayed at this hotel in both February and December of 2008 while attending theater productions in Chicago. The hotel is easy to get to and the service very good. All staff, from check in to valets to housekeeping personnel were friendly and helpful. We'll definitely go back for our next theater outing."
68,188,"Jan 20 2009 	Great Theatre Experience	This was a great way to see the Jersey Boys at the Chicago Theatre right next door! Nice boutique hotel. Friendly staff. This was also great perk during intermission because the bathroom lines were so long we went upstairs to use our own bathroom and enjoy a drink in time to come downtstairs for the 2nd half of the performance. Rosebud Resturant was in back which made a great quick dinner before the show. We would stay there again, but would go elsewhere for a better breakfast."
69,188,"Jan 14 2009 	Best Hotel Experience!!!	I had the most AMAZING experience at this hotel! Located in the center of downtown Chicago, the Hampton Majestic had everything I could possibly want in a hotel. First of all, the staff was absolutely wonderful. They went out of their way to make sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The room decor was beautiful and the FREE continental breakfast really put me in my &quot;happy place.&quot; I highly recommend this venue to anyone that wants to have a pleasurable hotel experience!"
70,188,"Jan 9 2009	Fantastic hotel	This was a beautiful hotel with a wonderful staff. Everyone was very, very friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect for theater, museums and the best of what Chicago offers. Would definitely recommend this hotel...it was probably the best hotel experience ever."
71,188,"Jan 2 2009	Good...	Only stayed one night, but it did what it said on the box, and was good value for money. Close enough to Union Station to walk there in the morning,and not that far to walk to Millennium Park and close to the El if you needed to go further.Decent city centre hotel."
72,188,"Dec 22 2008 	ok hotel for the price	this hotel was great, but there were some issues which coul have been due to the holidayus, but the staff was not the greatest and the rooms were cold. I also stayed at the Affinia during the same tripa nd I reccommend it over this one."
73,188,"Dec 7 2008 	Can't say enough for the staff....	My friend and I stayed at this the night before Thanksgiving and we were both so pleased with the people at the Hampton Inn Majestic. I, unfortunatey, didn't retain any names but the two women working the desk and all of the gentlemen who greeted us as we came and went, helped with directions, and helped carry our luggage were so very nice.I've stayed at a number of hotels and have experienced a variety of different attitudes from their staffs, but I have to say this was about the best experience I've ever had. The hotel itself was very nice and so very convenient for our stay, but there are lots of hotels, it was the people that will bring me back and for which I will recommend the Hampton Inn Majestic.Great job!"
74,188,Nov 2 2008 	Location Location Location	Fantastic Location in the heart of Downtown Chicago. Great breakfast (included) Wonderful Staff and great room
75,188,"Nov 2 2008 	Loved the Hampton Inn Majestic	Took the advice of other Trip Advisor reviewers and booked this hotel for three nights.We had a great time in Chicago; one of my new &quot;favourite&quot; cities.The hotel is in an excellent location for a tourist. Close to shopping, theatre, the Art Museum.The women who look after the breakfast room were very friendly and helpful, as were the doorman and the valet parking guys.The hotel was spotless and our rate was excellent value for money for this location.We saw Jersey Boys and loved it. We felt safe walking back to our hotel late at night. Chicago is a beautiful city and a great tourist destination."
76,188,"Oct 27 2008 	We Will Return	I'm still raving at not only the incredible customer service the hotel provided, but also the affordable price for the location. Thank you, we will definitely be back for our next stay in Chicago!"
77,188,"Oct 22 2008 	Great location especially if your going to the theater	This hotel was in a great location whether for going to the theater, shopping on the Magnificent Mile, MillenniumPark, or the art museum or all three. It is located right in the Theater District.The staff was very help ful with arranging the river architectural tour, and recommending restaurants. It was very clean, and just a great place to stay."
78,188,"Oct 18 2008	What a Find Gem in the Heart of Chicago Theatre District	Oh my gosh, what a &quot;Gem&quot; this was! From the time we arrived to the time we left everyone was courteous, attentive and just awesome! The rooms were wonderful, clean, comfortable and the beds were great for a good night sleep. In fact I might have to get their pillows. The staff could not have been more gracious. The breakfast bar was a delight with wide choices. The only thing I could find wrong was a make-up light or mirror would have helped, but that was the only thing wrong. I will not hesitate to stay here again. We were here for 4 days and it was a dream. The Manager and office manager were wonderful and made sure that everyone was treated like a special guest. Thank you to the whole staff at this Hampton. More hotels should have this staff, it was a 5 star!!! We definetely will be back to take in shopping and shows as they are all in walking distances. Thank you!"
79,188,"Oct 11 2008 	Fine Place to Stay	My husband and I spent 5 nights here in September. It was a great stay. The hotel is located in the Loop, within easy walking distance of Millennium Park, the Art Institute, the El, shopping, restaurants, etc. The hotel is very comfortable, and exceeds the usual high standards of Hampton Inns. The room was large and comfortable (although it did lack a mirror with decent lighting to apply makeup), the staff was amazingly responsive and cheerful. Breakfast was very good and there were computers in the lobby which you could use for free. We found this to be an excellent place to stay to explore the fabulous city of Chicago."
80,188,"Oct 7 2008	Simply The Best!!!!	Mayor Daley should be very proud of this hotel as it offered everything for the tourist/holiday maker etc.The room was superior !! FABULOUS comfy beds, TV, Coffee maker,hair dryer plus iron and board. The only thing I would have liked is a magnified make up mirror in the bathroom. BUT that is a mere observation!!Complimentary breakfast was excellent and the kitchen staff did a fine job. Computers available in the lounge which was most useful. Reception and lobby staff were very friendly and helpful and ,in fact, over and above the call of duty!! THANK YOU!  The Hilton Chain Management should be VERY PROUD of this hotel too!!Conveniently located for all 'touristy trips', restaurants, transport etc. Take the Blue line loop straight to and from O'Hare as the Hampton is only a minute away on Monroe. $2 only for a single ride of 40 mins!!I recommend the Tall Ship ride on 'Windy' based at The Navy Pier, 'The Untouchables' gangster theme trip was real fun!!See 'The Jersey Boys' not far to go as you are right there!! What a great show indeed plus 'The Turn of the Century' at the Goodman theatre ony 5 mins walk awayTake a leisurely stroll along the lake to the Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium.GO TO CHICAGO and have a wondeful time so much to see and do - lovely parks and trees throughout this vibrant city. HAVE FUN HERE!Jane"
81,188,"Sep 26 2008 	Great City Choice	Choosing big-city accomodations can be overwhelming due to the number of choices, especially if you are not overly familiar with that city...and they can also overwhelm your bank account.This Hampton Inn is a fine choice for city affordability and getting your bang for your buck. Bottom line is this:1. Clean and comfortable. Rooms are updated, great condition.2. Good staff service. Bellman are exceptional.3. Location to several &quot;El&quot; lines are within blocks - some even closer. Both lines that get you to/from either airport are also within walking distance, luggage and all. Completely doable - look for the elevator entrances to make it easier.4. Continental breakfast is decent for a quick start to the day. About what you expect - cereals, toast, muffins, juice, some hot choices etc. - remember the city always has plenty of local choices for a real breakfast, still this does just fine - fresh, clean, carbo loaded to get you going.5. Location &quot;in the loop&quot; is great - walkable to Millenium Park, River walks, trolley's for tours, Magnificent mile, Chicago Art Museum etc etc. You are right in the theatre district here. Plenty of restaurants - sit down and faster food and local choices. Plenty of transportation options - free trolley, tour trolley, all loop lines, taxis etc.Affordability + accomodation + location = great choice for the Windy City"
82,188,"Sep 16 2008 	perfect location!	Two friends and I stayed here for the Chicago Half Marathon. The hotel is in an ideal area- close to shopping, the train station, subway station, bus stations. The room was spacious enough for 3 of us- big bathroom, large shower, large closet with full length mirror. The front desk was friendly and helpful. Definitely will stay here again on my next visit!"
83,188,"Sep 14 2008 	Fabulous location and service	Stayed at the Majestic for 5 nights just after Labor Day and had an excellent experience. The hotel is located above the Majestic Theatre in the &quot;loop&quot;. The hotel is very unique in that the entrance in on the ground floor, but the lobby is on level 4. A bellman is always present on the ground level to see you in. The staff was excellent and we never had any problems with the facilities or our room. The rooms are of good size and decorated in dark theatre colors. The building is older, but was refurbished and is really a unique place to stay. We never had any noise problems with our neighbors or &quot;city&quot; noise-possibly because we were well above it (16th floor). An extra added bonus is that breakfast is provided every day. While not a 5-star meal, it was definitely adequate and got us started with our day nicely. A definite money-saver if staying with a family. Pubic transportation is extremely easy to use in Chicago and the Hampton is located within 1/2 block of the &quot;Red&quot; line of the El, which will give you access to just about anywhere in the city. The Metra is also within walking distance. We were able to walk to the Sears tower, Millennium Park, the waterfront, and all along Michigan Avenue. We often walked so far, that it just became easier to take the &quot;El&quot; back to our hotel as the station was so close (State/Monroe station). We'd stay here again if just for convenience alone. For the price, it's an excellent value considering location and breakfast. This is an excellent option if you'll be visiting Chicago."
84,188,"Sep 1 2008 	As others said GREAT HOTEL	Hi,I Stayed at the Hampton inn Majestic for 10 days, and I'm sure about one thing I'd like to go back there. First I'm gonna tell you about the room. I had booked a double room, the room was large enough (you can't have a run in the room but believe me it was enough). The beds were so comfortable, I'd have slept all the day long. The TV was huge and there was free HBO HD in the room. There were a lot of lovable amenities in the room such as the coffee maker, the free wireless access in the room, an iron and its table and a hair dryer. Of course there was the air conditioning in the room. The staff was helpful when we needed them, the housekeepers were kind too.The hotel is situated in the loop, it's situated within a very reasonnable walking distance to the major attractions such as the michigan avenue, state street... There are also a lot of good place to eat next to the hotel. It's also in the theatre's district, in the same building as a theatre, Jersey Boys is now performing in this theatre, I recommend it to you if you wanna spend a cool evening. There's also a fitness room in the hotel, which is good if you wanna train a little.The district feels totally safe by night, you can walk in the streets without fear and to finish I also recommend the free breakfast in the hotel which was very good and very complete.So if you wanna go to Chicago, and if you can get a good price at this hotel, it's the place to be."
85,188,"Aug 31 2008 	Good location	As with all Chicago hotels, ask about parking. The Majestic only offers valet parking and we paid $38. to park. It is worth noting as you compare prices. The Majestic is above the LaSalle Bank theater and therefore lots of traffic when theater lets out. As with all Hamptons, which is why I like them, good mattress and decent breakfast. The room was very clean and quiet. Hotel also felt secure and safe. Good shopping just around the corner on State street and not far to &quot;Magnificent Mile.&quot; The hotel is right in the heart of theater district which is especially nice if you are seeing a show. Near Art museum and free trolly to other museums and shopping. I would stay there again and would recommend to others."
86,188,"Aug 31 2008 	great location shame about the breakfasts	The location was great, literally just 5 minutes walk from Millenium Park and the Art Institute (where the tour busus also pick up), and only about 20 minutes walk to the Pier. The staff were all really helpful and friendly, especially considering we were rather early booking in. The room was a good size, clean and comfy, though it was it was the only hotel we stayed in that didn't have a fridge, which we missed, as we couldn't chill water and drinks ready to take out with us next day. We were also disappointed with the breakfasts - the choice was fairly basic, and only offered one hot dish, so we weren't able to stock up on a big American- sized breakfast for the day; it seemed to be catering more for business people, maybe? Also, there was no proper crockery, just polystyrene plates and bowls, and plastic cutlery, which seemed really strange in a decent hotel, and didn't help us enjoy what breakfast there was."
87,188,"Aug 25 2008 	Great hotel perfect location	Just spent 4 wonderful days in Chicago and stayed at the Hampton Majestic. For location, you can't beat the Majestic. It's conveniently located within walking distance of most of the theaters in the Loop, and right next door to the Bank of America Theater. Also for us shoppers, it is about 3 blocks from Macy's and other shopping on State Street. There are several great restaurants within walking distance, but to save a buck, I highly recommend taking advantage of the free hot breakfast. The staff was extremely helpful and kind, from Darrel the Bellman to the front desk staff, to the maids. I will be heading back to Chicago for Thanksgiving and am looking forward to another stay at the Majestic. If you have time and are a music lover, I HIGHLY recommend seeing Jersey Boys at the Bank of America theater. You will NOT be disappointed!"
88,188,"Jul 30 2008 	Comfortable Stay in a Great Location	We just got back from a three night stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic. We picked this hotel for our family of four based on location (near the theaters- we went to see Wicked, near Millenium Park, near the Art Museum) and price. The hotel is clean, modern, has comfortable beds. AC worked well and it wasn't too noisy. There was some street noise but, I would not call it loud. We did not hear the other hotel guests. The neighborhood felt safe-- we were travelling with our kids and the subway was only a few blocks away. On our last morning before the noon checkout, we went to Macy's on State St..... wow not like any Macy's we've ever seen. The staff at the hotel was friendly and accomodating.... we asked for more towels and they were promptly delivered to our room. Free breakfast was a huge plus-- the variety was good but no fresh eggs (bagels, yogurt, fruit, cereal, muffins etc.) Plenty of restaurants within walking distance-- and again, no problem walking around with young kids!! We would stay here again without any hesistation. The parking is a bit pricey but, it's the city. We parked the car and used the subways or we walked (Pizzano's has great thin crust pizza). Check in and out with the help of the staff was a breeze. If you are looking for someplace in the Loop, definitely, consider this hotel!!"
89,188,Jul 27 2008 	lacks star quality	The hotel is well situaited and is generally comfortable. We found the rooms exceptionally clean but the decor was very dark with little attempt to compensate for the lack of natural light due to the position of the room. The breakfast is a real bonus and avoids having to spend out at cafes etc. Price wise we found the rates varied considerably throughout the stay although $200 per night would in our view reflect value for money. Its a solid and safe choice with clean and comfortable rooms but dont expect luxury!
90,188,"Jul 9 2008 	Great hotel great staff great location. Will stay again!	Having planned a trip long in advance to hit the July 4th holiday (so we could attend the Taste of Chicago), I planned an Amtrak trip up and staying at the Hampton Inn Majestic. Though the rail trip was less than perfect, the Hampton proved an awesome way to recover. The location was perfect to walk to the Taste, the &quot;el&quot; red lines as well as the loop, countless buses - just an overall location. The breakfast was consistently good, well stocked, and the room was adequate (often a problem at free breakfast places). On July 4th, they even ran the breakfast an extra hour since it was a holiday.The staff was exceptionally friendly (the front door staff is some of the best I've met - one walked us to a bus to catch a train at Union Station, an excess bag in tow!). The rooms were clean and quiet, and the cleaning staff was early and quick to clean. My only regret is I couldn't take in one of the shows in the area. Needless to say, we will stay at this hotel again - a definite gem in the Hampton family."
91,188,"Jul 7 2008 	Great hotel and location!	We chose this hotel based on its proximity to the Blue Line, but it is also near some great stores for shopping. Our son lives in Bucktown, which has little or no hotel rooms, so the train was our best option. For Chicago, the Hampton Inn Majestic is an excellent value. The cost was reasonable, a hot breakfast was included, the room was large and recently updated, the beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was large, and the employees were all very helpful and friendly. They do a great job of keeping their breakfast area stocked and keep it open longer than a lot of other hotels that will remain nameless. I want to emphasize the friendliness of their employees, too. Many Chicago hotels have workers that don't care and are just putting in their time. The Majestic's employees are very helpful and outgoing. They really want to make you feel welcome, and they take pride in their hotel. We will definitely stay there again!"
92,188,"Jul 7 2008 	Friendliest Staff in Chicago 	Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Hampton Inn Majestic. The hotel is located directly above the Bank of America Theater (aka Lasalle, Shubert, &amp; Majestic Theater at various times in it's history). We attended Jersey Boys (highlight of our trip!) which is playing at the theater. The hotel is also just a couple of blocks from Millenium Park and Grant Park, so we were able to walk to Taste of Chicago &amp; the fireworks, so it was an ideal location for our trip. What Hampton Inn Majestic lacks is a grand entrance lobby, restaurants on site, a pool, and concierge. Our small travel group felt these &quot;missing&quot; items were more than made up by the hotel staff who were the friendliest and most helpful staff any of us have encountered in our travels! Everyone, from housekeeping to valet to front desk staff, went out of their way to answer questions and provide excellent service. The hotel has been open only a year or so. The rooms are fairly small and decorated in dark colors (carpet is brown, walls are burnt orange), basic but yet comfortable and functional. We all slept &quot;heavenly&quot; on the beds, and the pillows were the best we've had in a hotel setting. Soundproofing was extremely good for a downtown location in the Loop, which can be a problem for other hotels in the area. The breakfast in the lobby area was good, with typical fare for a complimentary hotel breakfast. Just a block or so from the hotel is Italian Village. It's kind of a landmark restaurant &amp; recommended for that reason alone. The Palmer House Hilton is just a block away, so make sure you walk into the lobby to marvel at it's beauty. Macy's on State Street is a couple of blocks away---if you like to shop, make sure you go there, since it's the flagship location of the former Marshall Fields (boo-hoo). Take the escalators or elevators to the 7th floor and peer into the Walnut Room and go the Visitor's Center. If you're hungry for a relatively inexpensive lunch, try any of the restaurants on the 7th floor---a nice switch from some other fast food joints. I would recommend the Hampton Inn Majestic for anyone who wants a location in the Loop for business or pleasure. It's ideal for theater goers and for those wanting a location near Grant Park. The free trolley stops are only a couple of blocks away, and you can easily get around without a car."
93,188,"Jul 7 2008 	Great Price Sophisticated Decor	We stayed at here for 2 nights June 28-30th, 2008. Our flight was delayed and we arrived close to midnight. The valet, while expensive at $38/day, was outside immediately unloading our bags and getting us into the hotel. We absolultely got our money's worth getting the car in and out many, many times over our stay.The check-in was easy especially considering the hour and we got our extra cot with no problem. The hotel does not have a restaurant which isn't really a problem in Chicago. We ordered carry out from the Italian Village across the street the first night - highly recommended. The next night we got food from Miller's Pub, a short walk down and around the block; good food there too. We ate lunch at Pizzeria Uno's which was fantastic even with a 1 hour wait time at 2pm in the afternoon.Breakfast was included and was fine - standard microwaved egg patties, bisquits, yogurt, cereals. The best part was the choice in 4 juices and the strong coffee they brewed.The room was large and clean and for $169 a night in the middle of the summer - fantastic!"
94,188,"Jun 15 2008 	Great Stay	Stayed for one night on June 7, 2008. Booked hotel with reward stay points. Everything about the hotel itself was great - comfortable bed, nice TV, very clean and modern bathroom. Only complaint is the valet parking....assuming they are partnered with the hotel because they operate for the theatre next door as well. We paid the 38 dollars a night since we didn't have to pay for the hotel but I would recommend finding a self-park garage - even the one they use! We waited for 45 minutes upon check-out for our car because apparently they didn't know in which spot they originally parked it in! Although they were very nice, but not too organized."
95,188,"May 15 2008 	Great Stay!	I was very pleased with my stay. The room was nicely decorated with my favorite colors (burnt orange and brown :-) There was a big flat screen t.v. in the room, large shower, hair dryer, amenities (soap, lotion, shampoo, mouth wash, etc.) The loby is located on the fourth floor, which is also where breakfast is served. I made it to the hotel about 9:30 and had to come back around 1:00 due to no rooms being ready. But they will allow you to store your bags there til you come back. That was o.k. with me, it gives you time to look around. The hotel is in a great location, near everything.I would return!"
96,188,May 10 2008 	Excellent Centrally Located Hotel	I stayed here for 2 nights recently and would recommend it to anybody. The rooms are good and the windows have decent black-out curtains. The staff were helpful and a decent breakfast is included...A real bargain..dc
97,188,"May 9 2008 	A Great Find!	I found this hotel on Expedia and immediately checked Trip Advisor to find only 10 reviews as it was a relatively new hotel. All of them were good, so that was enough for me. I can now add another good review. The reception is on the fourth floor as the hotel is above a theatre. There is no hotel bar, but a large(ish) lobby section where help yourself breakfast is served in the morning, together with a &quot;business area&quot; with wireless etc. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was because it was one of the very few I found in the USA that included breakfast in the price (what IS it with USA hotels that most of them don't!). On checking in, the receptionist told us our room was one of the smaller ones, so she would be moving us to a larger one - nice to hear. Our room was on the top floor (21st) and was very nice. The bed was enormous - could have fitted 3 people in it. I have a thing about double beds in hotels being too small (my husband and I simply cannot sleep in them) but you could have fitted 3 people in this one and it was SO comfortable. Nice big flat screen TV and all mod cons provided plus all the little niceties (flannels, shampoo, mouthwash, hairdryer etc). The other good thing about this hotel is the location - SO central. Right in the centre of the Loop. If you are a tourist on a short stay in Chicago with limited time, this hotel is ideal. I definitely recommend it."
98,188,"May 4 2008 	Thilled with HAMPTON INN MAJESTIC stay!	THE HAMPTON INN MAJESTIC and staff can't be beat for a Chicago stay - short or long! For starters, there is the delicous complimentary breakfast and the comfortably decorated rooms that utilize perfectly this historic building. Then consider the convenience of being within easy walking distance of the ART INSTITUTE; The Chicago symphony; The Majestic Theater (same building) as well as several other notable theaters; and endless shopping and architectural wonders! For culture or for easy sightseeing, Chicago is fabulous and the HAMPTON INN MAJESTIC is in the center of all. Finally, an unbeatable restaurant suggestion: AIGRE DOUX which is a relatively new restaurant and will be well rated in the new Zagat. If you're lucky, the talented chef will wander through the dining room and have time to stop and chat! Enjoy."
99,188,"Apr 28 2008	Great Stay	My friends and I chose this hotel because we planned to attend the Lasalle Bank Theatre to see the Jersey Boys. The hotel is set up with safety in mind and was just the ticket for 3 women in Chicago. The room was very pleasant, quiet and very clean. It was easy to get around Downtown from this hotel. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. I will reccomend this hotel to all my friends and family."
100,188,"Apr 27 2008 	What a hotel should be!	Great comfy and clean room, soft bed and plenty of room. We enjoyed the breakfast and Fitness room. along with free wireless internet.... fits our needs perfect! Only small issue was the first two days no shampoo until I called housekeeping, but other then that..fine job!!Easy to find next to &quot;Jersey Boys&quot;"
101,188,"Apr 21 2008	Great hotel close to everything.	My mom and I spent a long weekend in Chicago shopping, dining and seeing shows. This hotel was perfect. CLOSE to everything....we walked everywhere...up and down Michigan Ave and State Street. Took a cab to the Field Museum and it was only a few minutes and a low fare. The hotel is very safe and the staff was lovely. The rooms were a nice size, not huge, but I doubt you'd want to spend much time in your room with everything so close by! Breakfast was simple, but abundant. Price is great."
102,188,"Apr 7 2008	Good find	Great location for theater, good for downtown (but I preferred the northern neighborhoods). Free breakfast -- decent, nothing remarkable. Comfortable room. Internet included, 2 computers in the lobby. Free calls to 312 area code; 2 phones. Gym. HBO (but no Comedy Central). Hair dryer. Full length mirror, bathroom was well separated from sleeping area.Elevator security system requires card to access room floors. Several items (alarm clock, phone) have easy-to-use presets; digital thermostat near bed. A bit dark, though.I stayed here after the Essex, and my notes also say &quot;cups&quot; because the Essex had none!"
103,188,Mar 28 2008 	Great hotel very convenient	Great hotel in the heart of the Theatre district and just off State Street. Easy access to CTA. Very easy to get around the city and felt safe in the area.
104,188,"Mar 23 2008 	Great boutique style hotel	We liked this hotel for our last stay in Chicago. Quiet rooms, although they are small. Decor was very nice and the room was kept very clean. Bathroom was typical Hampton, but did have a nice vanity.It's in the theater district, so very handy for seeing a show. The front desk staff were okay, not too friendly. But the doorman and bellhop almost made up for this. Would not hesitate to stay here again, although I would not recommend it for families.Great boutique hotel for half the price of others. Also forgot to mention nice flat screen TV and free wireless internet."
105,188,"Mar 17 2008 	Great Location Pleasantly Surprised	As a regular business traveler to Chicago, I was surprised to find this very convenient and reasonably priced hotel. It is a very good location for anyone with meetings in the Loop and is also very convenient to public transit. Although I arrived well before check-in thanks to an early AM flight, they were more than happy to check me in upon arrival. Service was very efficient and the rooms were nicely appointed for a Hampton Inn. The free breakfast was perfect for getting a quick bite to eat before meetings, and the WiFi worked great. I'd definitely stay at this property again and have already recommended it to others."
106,188,"Mar 16 2008 	If you can afford it stay here!	This hotel was fabulous! Beautiful, clean, comfortable and a with a great location. We walked everywhere we needed to go, which is a good thing because parking in Chicago is outrageously priced. (I'm from Northeastern Nevada where parking is free). The staff was helpful and breakfast was yummy. The beds and bedding were to die for!"
107,188,"Feb 29 2008 	Perfect!	Our stay couldn't have been better. Walking distance to the Art Institute of Chicago, State Street shopping. We had a beautiful, clean, quiet room with high ceilings, great breakfast, friendly staff. And extremely affordable - $150. We felt like we were staying in a boutique hotel for half the price. We will definitely stay there again when we are in Chicago."
108,188,"Feb 9 2008 	Great experience!	We were so pleasantly surprised with this hotel. I never expected so much for a Hampton Inn. I chose it because of its proximity to the Federal Building but would go back for pleasure anytime. We had a deluxe king room which was very spacious with a pull out couch and coffee table, flat panel tv, microwave and refrigerator with a bar area. The room was decorated wonderfully, was very well maintained and the bed was so comfortable. The only thing I think could be improved upon is the front desk being more forthcoming with dining info. Due to the fact that the hotel does not have an in-house restaurant, we would have appreciated more suggestions in the room about nearby places to eat. There is a nice restaurant right across the street with a wine bar."
109,188,"Dec 23 2007 	A great small hotel!	My husband and I enjoyed our stay here very much. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the location can't be beat. You are a stone's throw from State Street and the Art Institute. The Civic Opera house is a 15-minute walk and the Field Museum campus is about a 30-minute walk. Our room was small but extremely clean (and I am particular) with a comfortable bed and lots of towels. The bath vanity is wide enough to hold a makeup case on each side of the sink, and there's room on the open shelves underneath for other supplies. The only drawback is the parking fee of $38 per day and no local newspapers. Breakfast is ample (the hot dish changes daily), with plenty of tables, and the coffee is excellent!"
110,188,"Dec 12 2007	Nice Hotel	My wife and I stayed at the Hampton Majestic for one night, for the purpose of seeing Wicked.We were impressed with the hotel The room was well appointed, the beds extremely comfortable - more luxury than we expected from a Hampton. Most everybody there on the weekends is there to see a show - so it's kind of cool commiserating with people about what show they saw. It is not very close to the Mag Mile Shopping, but you could walk it if you had to. It's probably 10-15 blocks from the heart of it.For late night munches, the front desk has some menus for delivery services - we ordered from the Chinese place they had a menu for and it was the best Chinese food I have ever tasted. Unfortunately our room did not have a frig, so we couldn't save our leftovers. I guess most rooms don't have a frig or microwave so make sure you ask.We parked at the Millenium Garage Parking and it was only about 4 blocks to the hotel - very convenient. I would definitely stay there again if I needed a room in the loop. Very happy with the choice. If you are looking for a very nice room in the loop, start here."
111,188,"Nov 25 2007 	great deal in the Loop	I stayed here with a friend for a conference in mid-November for about$200/night. It's clean, well-kept, with a breakfast buffet--in short, a great deal for a convenient location right around the corner from the EL Blue Line Monroe stop. The staff was friendly, but not terriblyforthcoming about the neighborhood; we asked about a place to eat, andthey sent us to an awful pub. BUT--remember, this is the Loop so there's not a lot going on for eating or drinking.It's within walking distance of Milenium (sp) Park and Michigan Avenue (if you don't mind the cold!)--the Art Institute is across the street. If you're on the Miracle Mile, and looking to save some money,have lunch at the restaurant at Nordstroms (not the cafe, the restaurant)--it's excellent and you can get a large salad or a hot meal for under $10 a meal. Great for families.One warning: DO NOT USE THE VALET PARKING. There's plenty of city parking (check out the corner of S. Dearborn and Monroe--behind Milenium Park) for $20 overnight, half the price the hotel charges."
112,188,"Nov 22 2007 	Nov 21 2007 -- Great Hotel to stay for Thanksgiving parade	My family of 3 just returned from a 1 night stay to see the Thanksgiving Day parade 11/21/2007 . We were literally steps away from where the parade passed by on State St. The hotel is clean with contemporary furnishings and the staff very friendly. It does not have a &quot;GRAND&quot; lobby or a restaurant, but there is a Chop House across the street w/wine bar and the Italian Village which has 3 levels of restaurants is a block away. We ate in the lower level &quot;excellent&quot;!!!We had a king bed with sofa bed. The room was very spacious, loved the decor and colors. There's a frig and microwave and a beautiful flat screen TV. There were fresh cookies in the lobby around 5:30pm. The breakfast was pretty nice, with fruit, brkt burritos, biscuits, cereal. pastries and juice.Overall it was a great experience. We would stay here again.The rooms do have connecting doors which may allow sound through from the next room, but if your neighbors are not too rowdy, the noise is not a factor."
113,188,"Nov 17 2007 	Excellent hotel! Excellent stay!	I traveled to Chicago for a conference and the hotels in which the conference was located were severely overpriced. By luck I found the Hampton Inn Majestic. It's reasonably priced, is well located, comes with a delicious breakfast, and great gym. Not only was the hotel well priced and stocked with amenities, the staff was courteous, the rooms are large and clean, and entire hotel was very clean. The city sounds did not keep me awake. Each room has a flat screen TV. Further, each cardio machine in the gym (2 treadmills, a bike, and an elliptical machine), all had small flat screen tvs. As a graduate student, I travel on a budget, and this hotel was an excellent solution."
114,188,"Nov 13 2007 	Great value hotel in central Chicago	Very central hotel, middle of the loop, just a few minutes from Millenium Park and the Art Institute, very convenient for public transport, restaurants and shops. Macy's is just a few blocks away. The bedrooms are modern, with a very comfortable bed and crisp clean white sheets. There's free wifi access throughout the hotel, as well as free access to two computers down in the reception area for those who don't have a laptop with them. Breakfast was included in the price and there was a good choice. However, as the hotel isn't really geared up for serving meals (no restaurant as such), breakfast is self service on plastic plates which let it down a bit. Breakfast is served in the reception area, and there is no lounge area to speak of. But this was a minor consideration, and although there are no frills, the service generally was great. Staff were friendly, especially the doormen who guard the main entrance and can help with finding taxis etc. There aren't many rooms on each floor, so there's quite a homely feel to the place. It's an old building, which has been updated well. Would definitely stay here again."
115,188,"Oct 30 2007 	Hidden Little Gem in the Theatre District	We stayed here the last weekend of October. We were going to an event at The Chicago Theatre and we had taken the train into the city. This location is extremely convenient if you want to be near Union Station and the Theatre District and/or Loop. The hotel is less than one mile from Union Station. It is also close to Millennium Park, The Art Institute, Sears Tower and the Chicago Board of Trade. There is also all sorts of shopping nearby, but nothing as swanky as what you'd find on North Michigan Ave.The hotel is small. It sits on top of the LaSalle Bank Theatre. The entrance for the hotel is located right next to the entrance to the theatre. The lobby for the hotel is on the 4th floor. Our experience with the front desk staff was tolerable. We only dealt with them while checking in and we had to wait while the clerk picked up and talked on the telephone (twice) before even acknowledging we were there. The bell staff downstairs at the entrance are young and unprofessional compared to what you normally see at downtown hotels. When we came back into the hotel after being at the theatre they were like kids playing in the yard...jumping on each other and not having a care in the world that we were there waiting for the elevator. No big deal, just very unprofessional.The hotel is clean. The room is decorated well and is very comfortable. The bed is VERY comfortable as were the pillows. Since the hotel is small there are only about 10 rooms on each floor so it is relatively quiet.We did not stay for the free breakfast but it was crowded and looked decent. They had one hot item (biscuits &amp; gravy the day we were there...yuck!) and then cold cereal, bagels, pastries, juices, etc. They have coffee &amp; tea available in the lobby 24/7.We will definitely return to this hotel again. The price was right and the room clean and comfortable!"
116,188,"Oct 8 2007 	Great Hotel	This hotel was great. Great location, great staff, great rooms. I was really impressed. I was in town for the chicago marathon and went to visit friends staying at the Renaissance. They paid almost twice what I did and I liked my room much more, it was comfortable and contemporary, even had a HD flatscreen in the room. The only thing that is different than I expected was the lobby was on the fourth floor. The entrance of the hotel on the first floor is next door the to the Majestic Theatre, the lobby/rooms are above the theatre. It is a great hotel and I would stay there again."
117,188,"Sep 15 2007 	Wonderful Hotel!	I stayed here for 6 nights for a recent business trip. This was a great hotel. Room was a good size, clean (very clean) and quiety (very, very quiet), very nice contemporary decor, incredibly comfortable bed, free wireless internet connection, nice bathroom. I had zero complaints. There is breakfast available in the a.m. - a couple of hot items along with toast, cereal, etc. Not bad at all. The location was great - very near the Art Institute and Millenium Park. It is a small hotel - only 135 rooms and very much has the feel of a small boutique-type hotel. There is no restaurant on the premisis, but they do have a &quot;room service&quot; arrangment with the Italian Village Restaurant down the street, so if you want dinner in your room it is not a problem. I almost hating writing such a good review because this hotel is a great find and I don't want it to be booked and unavailable when I want to stay here again. I much prefered my stay here to the Palmer House or the Drake (both of which I have stayed in in the past year or so). Oh, and I am a &quot;plus size&quot; traveler and the room was very comfortable for me- desk chair and lounging chair in the room were both armless - which was a very nice plus."
118,188,Sep 3 2007	Excellent Hotel!!	The rooms at the Hampton Inn Majestic were great! The beds were amazingly comfortable...lots of fluffy pillows that were just right. The decor is very nice- contemporary and really makes the place look like a 4 star hotel. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous. It was just a short walk to Michigan Ave and Millenium Park. I would definately recommend this hotel- it is a steal!!
119,188,"Aug 29 2007 	Great hotel in great location	Ideal hotel for sightseeing! We got a very nice room, with loads of space and a big bathroom. Hot breakfast was included in the price, which is always a plus. The hotel is ideally located for sightseeing, in the centre of the Chicago loop. It was a bit pricey though."
120,188,"Aug 25 2007 	Great hotel great location	This is a very nice hotel located about two blocks away from Millenium Park and the Art Institute. It is also in the middle of the theatre district, next door to the Schubert Theatre, and blocks away from many good restaurants. The only downside to the location is that the hotel is not extremely close to the magnificent mile. The rooms are clean and new, though not particularly spacious. The free breakfast included one hot item and the normal assortment of cereals, muffins, toast, etc. Staff were very friendly and helpful. In short, I would highly reccomend the Hampton Inn Magestic for those looking for an affordable but nice hotel close to Chicago's parks and musuems."
121,188,"Aug 21 2007 	Great hotel in Chicago downtown	This is the best hotel I have stayed at so far in Chicago (stayed at Travelodge and Congress Plaza in the past).This one has a much central location and rooms are wonderful. It has been renovated recently and it is not cheap renovation.Big bed, nice bathroom and big LCD TV's.Also there is free wireless which is not easy to find in Chicago hotels, usually you pay for $10 the connexion.Very close to Michigan Avenue, Magnificient Mile or many theatres or great restaurant.Breakfast is free as well, typical buffet from hotel chains though, nothing exceptional on this side.Rooms are not cheap ($160 per night) but this is market price in Chicago downtown.Expect also $38 a night for valet parking which is expensiveHighly recommended overall"
122,188,"Aug 14 2007 	Great experience	This is a great hotel in the theater district. We found the room to be reasonably priced (as far as Chicago goes), and the location can't be beat -- a block or two from the El (which gives you access to just about everything) and a block or two from Millennium Park. The room was comfortable (the bed was great!!), of decent size, and of nice decor. The complimentary breakfast was well stocked and very convenient -- to be expected with Hampton Inn's. We had no problems with the wireless internet or with noise while in our room. And we found the staff (desk and valet) to be very friendly and accommodating.One minus was that there was valet parking only, though this is pretty much to be expected in any city."
123,188,"Aug 3 2007 	Clean quiet and central	I knew this property was a new renovation when I booked but I had no idea just how clean it would be. The property was spotless. There were a few things here and there which gave the impression they did the conversion on the cheap. It's set in the old lasalle bank building which is from the 20's i think, and there are a few odds and ends which stick out. Other than that, the property is very nice. The service was helpful, but a few of the girls at the front desk were very unfriendly... though still helpful, if that makes sense.This property is close to the trains so anyone traveling outside of the loop will have to walk a maximum of 2 blocks. A tip for those of whom may be unfamiliar with the city, downtown is dead at night so if you are looking for an area with active night life, this may be the wrong place for you. Look into River North or Lincoln Park.They have a complimentary wireless connection and two computers in the lobby so it was never difficult to get online. Overall I found the room to be of average size, but the view from 21fl was pretty good. The LCD monitors were a nice surprise and the bed was very comfy. I'd stay here again."
124,188,"Jul 16 2007 	A restful home base in the Loop	Although this property seems geared toward business travelers (no swimming pool, for example), it suited our family of four, three-night Chicago vacation, with its central location. It was convenient to the major attractions we saw, from the Hancock Observatory and Navy Pier in the north, to the Museum of Science and Industry in the south, and the Museum Campus and Grant Park/Millenium Park in the middle. Hailing a taxi at the front door or catching a city bus on State Street is easy. Staying here during a theatre weekend (to see a show like Wicked at the nearby Oriental or High School Musical at the LaSalle Bank Theatre) would be ideal.The property is in a newly-converted office tower over the LaSalle Bank Theatre (formerly the Schubert), in the Theatre District, with a smallish lobby on the fourth floor. The street entrance is a small elevator lobby with bellman station, which feels like a private stage door with its proximity to the theatre box office. There are several rooms on each floor, not dozens. Our 19th floor room faced the office building across Monroe Street, with no view of the street below thanks to a ledge, and no view of Lake Michigan.The high-ceiling rooms are simply and tastefully decorated, in an upscale Pottery Barn-like style, with numerous small touches such as a lapdesk, very comfy beds and pillows, complimentary weekday USA Today, HDTV, and unexpected extra bath amenities like mouthwash and cotton balls. The desk area has an Ethernet port for laptop connection to their LAN. There are two DELL PCs in the lobby with attached printer (the so-called &quot;business center&quot;), which were often occupied by teens -- most business travelers apparently bring their own laptops. WiFi connections are also available.Our room was comfortable and quiet, in spite of being across the hall from the soft drink machine. It had an easy-to-use, digital thermostat. The HVAC fan was quiet and effective. We experienced no street noise, and only occasional running water noise from the adjacent room.The scrambled-egg based hot breakfast buffets were well-stocked, with cold items ranging from yogurt cups to cereal, bagels, and breads also available, plus light and dark roast coffees and juices (even a pomegranate variety). The buffet was good, convenient, and gave us one less thing to worry about each morning. Finding a seat was a little problematic for us one morning, although &quot;grab-and-go&quot; breakfast bags are also available and table turnover seemed fairly continual. Show up early or late to avoid the crowd.I was sorry to read about the service lapses that spoiled the stays recounted in other reviews. We enjoyed nothing but good service thoughout our stay.Dining hint: walk one block north to Madison Street and then right (east) to Pizano's (61 E. Madison, just past Wabash Avenue) for some to-die-for Chicago deep dish pizza in a quintessential, friendly Chicago venue. Get there early to avoid the line, it's a popular place."
125,188,"Jul 7 2007 	Not your usual Hampton Inn	Located in the heart of Chicago's Loop, this beautifully restored hotel is not your typical Hampton Inn. The rooms, with 12-foot ceilings, top-of-the-line furnishings and big flat-screen HDTV's, would not be out of place in any 5 star hotel.As with any Hampton Inn, there is no &quot;nickel and diming&quot;. In-room internet, breakfast and local calls are all free. Be warned though that, if you are staying during a busy period, the breakfast lounge/reception area feels more like a crowded cruise ship restaurant (this is not a good thing). Finding a seat will be all but impossible.The fitness center is painfully small, with a few (albeit new) cardio machines and 1 all-in-one workout contraption.All of the staff are exceedingly friendly. As to whether they are efficient I couldn't say as I had no problems or complaints for the entire 5 days I was there."
126,188,"Jun 24 2007 	We Had A Great Experience	We had a wonderful experience at our recent stay. Staff: The staff was very polite and met our requests very promtly, without the attitude that you sometimes get from other hotels. They seemed genuine and not as though they were just being polite becasue they were &quot;forced &quot; to by management. Room: Our room was great the hotel is decorated in an Art Deco style and seems very new and clean. The bathrooms were large, TV was great, and the bed was comfortable. Ammenities: The workout room was fantastic, open 24 hours, which is great for me. The equipment was all new and top of the line gym quality. The treadmills and ellipticals had TV's attached so there was no worrying about bothering other users with your TV noise! Although I had the gym to myself.Misc. Breakfast was free in the morning and was great."
127,188,"Jun 15 2007 	Terrible Service	I was looking forward to staying at the Hampton Majestic on a business trip after reading the reviews here. My flight was severely delayed. I called ahead to the Hampton to let them know that I'd be arriving very late, but that I would still be coming and to please hold my room. The person on the phone thankedme and asked me to call if there was any change.I arrived at the hotel at 2:45 am (3:45 am to my body) quite tired, to find that there were no rooms available, despite the fact I had areservation guaranteed for late arrival and called ahead. All I wanted to do at this time was get to sleep as quickly as possible, since I had a meeting at 8:30 the next morning. Instead, in addition to learning I would not be checking in and going to bed, I was told I'd be take to the &quot;other&quot; Hampton Inn. As a single female traveler in downtown Chicago which has some less than wonderful areas, you can imagine my apprehension at learning I'd be taken to a location I was not familiar with in the middle of the night. The other hotel was not in walking distance to my office, and to top it off, I'd have to bring my luggage to the office in the morning so I could move back to the Majestic the following evening. The desk clerk after some discussion gave memoney to take a cab in the morning. I finally was settled in the other hotel at 3:15 am.The hotel rooms are very nice and just as described in the reviews, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend a hotel that did this to anyone."
128,188,"May 29 2007 	AMAZING HOTEL ! ! ! It's the best value for your money!	This hotel is amazing! The price is right! The location is great! The rooms are spacious with everything you need. I really couldn't believe this was a Hampton Inn. It felt like a 5-star hotel.This hotel is right next two &quot;L&quot; Subway locations. The red and blue lines. The blue line takes you right to O'Hare Airport. The red line takes you up to the Lakeview, Boystown, and the Northside. You are two blocks away from Marshall Fields (opps, I mean Macy's) (Note: I miss Fields) My room had a king-size pillow top bed with 4 comfortable pillows. One morning, I didn't want to get out of bed! Plush bath towels. The 25&quot; TV is flat screen LCD HD. Also, in-room coffee maker. In the lobby the hotel offers a FREE breakfast every morning. Oh, and how about this. . . . no telephone charge for a local call. The staff is excellent ! ! Housekeeping, Bell Caption, Front desk, everyone, all seems to enjoy working at this hotel.Finally, I will recommend this hotel to all my friends, and will definitely return."

1,193,GOOD PLACE	It is a very comfortable hotel to enjoy your trips in a very good location
2,193,"Nov 10 2009 	Good Value for Location	Hotel is just steps away from the Red Line &quot;L&quot; so you can get around easily if you don't want to walk, drive or cab it.Very clean hotel, good water pressure, friendly &amp; accommodating staff, nice bed &amp; pillows (but the top sheet and pillow cases felt like they'd been starched!), temp. in room perfect &amp; can be adjusted. Didn't try Weber Grill but it looked inviting for a drink and a quick meal.2 computers are on 12th floor (need room key to access the room), so you can check email &amp;/or print out your boarding passes.Hotel is near a lot of great shopping, Pops for Champagne is around the corner &amp; only wish we had gone there. Mary's Cafe is good for breakfast &amp; is abt. 4 blocks away.If we can get as good a rate as we did this time, I'm pretty sure we'll stay here again when we visit Chicago."
3,193,"Oct 29 2009 	Great Deal for Downtown Chicago	I live in the area and stayed downtown for business. This hotel had updated rooms, very comfy beds, reasonable sized bathrooms and very good service. I am sensitive to odors, like Febreze covering up bad smells. Hilton Garden Inn smelled fresh and clean and had comfortable rooms. You can hear ambulance/police car sounds at night, which is typical of all Chicago area hoteld. Staff seemed friendly. I felt safe, and Weber Grill reataurant on site is a great place to eat. No probablem getting a cab in the morning when it was raining. I would recommend and stay again. Most downtown hotels have smaller rooms (especially in older hotels). This location is very good for visitors. Tons of places to eat within walking distance."
4,193,"Oct 19 2009 	It is just ok...	We were in town for a wedding and had two rooms booked; one for this hotel and the other for Residence Inn for a much cheaper rate. (See my review for Residence Inn) We arrived early as our flight landed at Midway at 7:55am and I had already called about an early check in. When we arrived they indicated that they were at 90% capacity. They did not have a non-smoking king room sbut had two queen non-smoking available for the same rate, so we took it! The room was nothing to write home about. The bed was not comfortable at all but the pillows were nice. The remote was old and barely worked most of the time which annoyed me to no end. Breakfast was not complimentary and just to get pastries and yogurt it was $10.95. If you wanted meant that was going to cost you an additional $4.95. I called one of the restaurants in the book from the hotel and ordered myself breakfast which came up to $19.22. They informed me that the menu has not been updated and the meal that was priced at $8.25 was now $10.50. I decided to cancel my order."
5,193,"Oct 18 2009 	Wouldn't stay again	My brother was getting married in Chicago. I was going to book the hotel for the weekend but we decided to stay one night and I'm glad we did. Based on some of the other reviews, some of the rooms must be updated with newer beds. Our beds were so uncomfortable that my husband and I didn't sleep all night and got up with sore backs and necks. The tub in the bathroom wouldn't drain. I ended up not taking a shower in the morning because I didn't want to stand in inches of water. The room had a nice flat screen TV but seemed a little smaller then the average room. We wouldn't stay again even though I'm a Hilton honors member....I would stay some where else."
6,193,"Oct 12 2009 	Awesome amenities great location affordable prices	This hotel was perfect and I wouldn't have changed a single thing about my two night stay. The rooms and common spaces were impecably clean and cozy. Although a little small, the indoor pool and hot tub were both wonderful along with the well appointed fitness room and computer lab with complimentary high speed internet. I loved the microwave and mini-fridge in the room along with the Neutrogena toiletries. The king size bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Be sure to stop by the lobby around 6:00pm/7:00pm every night for complimentary warm just-baked cookies. The hotel could do well with a dedicated concierge in the lobby to help travelers find their way around the city in order to keep the lines down at the front desk."
7,193,Oct 10 2009 	A nice cheap hotel	The hotel was a great place to stay. It is close to many attractions. The staff was helpful in referring us to nearby restaurants. My only complaint would be that the toilet paper is too far away from the toilet. You almost have to get off of the seat in order to reach it. The housekeeping staff was great in locating my clothing that I had inadvertently left behind. They are in the process of shipping it to me. I would definitely stay here again!
8,193,"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent hotel in prime location	This is an excellent hotel in every way, but be careful if you are there 4Q2009, as there is major construction going on outside the hotel on one side and the jackhammers started up on cue at 7am every morning. Really fun restaurant (Weber Grill) and right on the Red Line of the subway system. Walkable to Michigan Avenue, Marshall Field's, theatre district. Coffee maker also stocked with tea, which I am finding more and more rare these days. Couldn't fault it!"
9,193,"Oct 9 2009 	Enjoyed the stay	The Hilton Garden Inn was a great location for us, it is very close to the red line if you would prefer not to take a taxi from the airports. We walked everywhere from our hotel and enjoyed its easy access.The staff we encountered were very nice and helpful with any of our questions or needs. The room we stayed in was very clean and comfortable. You can hear some street noise, but it is in the city so it was very much expected and did not affect our stay at all.We also ate at the restaurant, Weber Grill, and it was great. Although it was a busy night, the waiter was very friendly and attentive. The pretzel rolls were very good and the ribs were excellent. Would stay here again."
10,193,"Oct 7 2009 	Outstanding value and location	It's hard to find a decent hotel in downtown Chicago at a decent price during the week. I booked my room a few months in advance and found a great $149 rate. Everything about this HGI was great, from the speedy check-in, to the clean rooms, to the location, nothing could be better. What's really great is this hotel is literally steps from the Red Line stop at Grand. You walk up the stairs and the hotel is about 20 steps away which is very convenient if you're coming in on the train. For those that need any grocery items , there is a grocery store right around the corner where you can find items like soda without paying high hotel prices. I had a great view on the 21st floor and although this is just a standard HGI, the room was very clean and had a nice flat screen TV inside the room. I ate at the hotel restaurant (Weber Grill) one night and it was great. Overall a typical HGI experience, but for the price, you can't beat it for the convenience, location and price!"
11,193,Oct 2 2009 	Nice rooms but terrible organization/staff.	Booked room with 2 beds directly through hotel on the phone. Was going for a bachelor party and staying with 4 guys so definately needed 2 beds. When arrived at hotel they said they only had me booked for 1 bed. I showed them my confirmation email on my phone and they didnt care. Gave me bed with one room and only got $20 off and room was $200 per night. I was able to swich to double bed next day but what a hassle. Also the elevator broke and had to wait 45 min for the freight elevator! The rooms themselves were nice and good location only a couple minute walk from magic mile.
12,193,"Sep 29 2009 	Needs a renovation	The streets are under renovation, but the hotel isn't... and it needs a good one. Towels are worn-out and have holes, there isn't a shower cup in the bathroom, the shower courtain is quite old, the reception has two sofas and a couple of armchairs, but no bar. The hotel has a very smal pool and a very small fitness room. Is not worth the price they charge you. You have better options in Chicago."
13,193,"Sep 10 2009 	Great hotel with an ever better location	After much research, we chose to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn because of the great rate and location. The location could not have been any better. We got off the Red Line of the &quot;L&quot;, walked up the steps and were right outside the lobby of the hotel. Rode the subway and buses everywhere we went, if we didn't walk from the hotel's central location. Also, there is a free trolley to/from Navy Pier that stops directly in front of the hotel. If it is too full, just grab a city bus (#29) that will also take you to Navy Pier.The front desk was very friendly, professional, and helpful. Since we arrived around noon, our room was not ready for check-in, so we left our luggage with the bellhop and were on our way to explore Chicago. When we came back, our room was ready and we retrieved our luggage.The hotel was very clean, well-appointed, and everything seemed to be in working order. I was bit concerned about noise based on other reviews but we had absolutely no problems, except the occasional siren outside but that will happen with any hotel in downtown Chicago.The pool area was nice but small. We did enjoy the hot tub one night after a long day of walking.We will definitely try to stay here again on our next trip to this great city."
14,193,"Sep 10 2009 	It was magnificent!	We arrived early to Chicago hoping to leave the luggage in the hotel... but the room was already available, even at 10:30am!The location couldn't be better, and the service was amazing."
15,193,"Sep 9 2009 	Noisy Buy Nice	I have stayed here several times and this hotel is nice and in a great location with a great restaurant attached. However, I have noticed as the rates have dropped at this HGI due to the economic downturn I suppose you get the &quot;in town to party&quot; crowd and they are noisy coming and going all hours of the nights. If this wasn't enough noise, we were on the 22nd floor and you could hear people in the street wooping it up until the wee hours. There were many many sirens and you could hear traffic noise especially motorcycles. This is a very noisy hotel."
16,193,"Aug 8 2009 	Great location for downtown stay	We stayed at this hotel during our stay in July. The location couldn't have been better. The hotel was only two blocks off Michigan Ave. There were a ton of restaurants within a three block area so that was easy. The red line was literally right by the front door, the free Navy Pier trolley ran right by the hotel and most of the buses that you need for tourist items were only two blocks away. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was very clean. There is a parking garage next door where you can self park and save yourself some money. The pool was small, but the temperature was perfect. The workout room had a lot to offer. We would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a downtown stay and would stay here again."
17,193,"Aug 7 2009 	EXcellent Location	This hotel is perfect location..Only a block or so from Magnificent Mile ( Michigan Ave)..Train Subway is right in front of the hotel,,took trains to Wrigley Field, Cellular Field and to the theater district to see Jersey Boyzz....Parking is a little expensive $44 per day with in and out priviliges but you are in the city and not much of a choice..The on-soite restaurant Weber Grill has good food , plus you are surrounded by great restaurants and shopping all around...Indoor pool made my little one happy , although the ventilation is horrible in the pool area, the chlorine smell and lack of cool air was made it difficult to stay long in the pool area for us...The rooms are modern, clean, so no complaints there..If we were to return to this part of Chicago I would stay here again and have no problem recommending it to others.."
18,193,"Aug 3 2009 	Would definitely stay here again!	We Pricelined this hotel for a short getaway to meet friends in Chicago. ~ Paid more than we wanted to, but still a great deal! Really great location... a few short blocks from Michigan Ave. The corner room was lovely, with a view of an outdoor rooftop landscaped track next door. The room was a little cramped with two queen beds, rather than one king, but had everything you could want. The built-in cabinet with microwave, counter w/coffee pot &amp; fridge was SO pretty ~ I want one in my house! The beds were SO comfy, except I found myself sticking to the sheets, due to the thick pillowtop underneath. Overall, a great place for a great getaway in Chi-town!"
19,193,"Aug 1 2009 	Do not stay here under any circumstances!	I'm writing this review to warn fellow travelers not to stay here. Because the wonderful Homewood Suites next door was booked up, we were wound up staying here. I expected this hotel to be similar to the Homewood Suites. Instead, it was a complete disappointment. Sure, the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the rooms were very clean. However, ultimately, when you pay for a hotel room, you're paying for a place to sleep for the night. The Hilton Garden Inn is a total, complete and utter failure in this regard. The walls have absolutely no soundproofing at all. You can here your neighbor's TV, conversations, everything. One night, I got shaken awake by my neighbor who happened to like to blast his TV at 1:00 a.m. And mind you, all rooms are like this. I kept changing rooms, and they all have the same walls which seem to be made out of a thin piece of drywall, or possibly even cardboard. No matter which room you're in, you'll be able to here TV's and conversations from the rooms adjacent to you. This place also serves no breakfast, unless you're willing to pay a rediculous amount of money for cornflakes and a bagel. You're better off staying in a cheap motel. Cheap motels that I've stayed at had better services and better soundproofing than this Hilton Garden Inn. If you're just looking for a nice, quiet place to sleep, do not stay at this hotel. For what you get out of it, it is totally overpriced and generally not a pleasant place to be."
20,193,"Jul 27 2009 	great location low on staff	location was great, resterant on sight was good, indoor pool was clean, warm enough to enjoy, whirl pool great as well, great location, few steps from the red line metro. Had a few issues with lack of staff. Had no towels, called front desk, took about 4 hours to get towels. next day no one cleaned room at all. called front desk about 6pm, someone came about 830pm to clean, didnt get usa today either but other rooms did. Same deal the next day as well, did come to clean the third day...... no conceirge on hand, tried to wait on line to ask desk staff questions, they were busy and not very accomodating. Rooms were large and nice, location was great, close to everything, but don't expect service any time soon, very short on staff and it was obvious."
21,193,"Jul 25 2009 	My first choice in Chicago	This was our third time staying at the Hilton Garden Inn. We reserved the room through Priceline, spending only $65 per night. TIP: The &quot;two Queen bed&quot; rooms are much larger than the King rooms. THE PROS:The bedding is updated, there is a microwave, coffee maker, mini-fridge and flat screen TV. We LOVED the Jewel grocery store just steps from the hotel. It stays open until midnight, too, and sells beer, wine and liquor along with the usual grocery store items. (In my home state you have to go to a special store to by alcoholic beverages.) The entrance to the Red Line train is just outside the hotel door and Michigan Ave is just three blocks away. The location is great!Free in-room internet service - and it actually worked well! THE CONS:There is no High Def service to the TV, though, so everything on the TV looks stretched out. (No big deal.)The lobby is very bland and small - but who really cares about that?We didn't use the pool, hot tub or exercise room.We MUCH prefer the Hilton Garden Inn to the nearby Marriott. We take about four trips to Chicago each year and have stayed at several different places but the Hilton Garden Inn remains our favorite."
22,193,"Jul 23 2009 	Good Time had by Me	I stayed for one week while attending a business conference. Within easy walking distance to Navy Pier, Art Institute, theater district, etc. Grocery store and Starbucks both across the street. Clean, comfortable, and quiet room. Only downside...$15 for an in-room movie was steep, and a small selection of titles."
23,193,"Jul 19 2009 	Great location!!	Pretty much had nothing much to complain about the hotel. Except when we checked in the staff who checked us in did not smile or greet us and continue talking to other staff while serving us. With the brand name, I expect polite and caring staff, but we did not get it here. However, there's another staff later who's really attentive, so I guess we just got unlucky being served by that one lady during our check in time. Room was clean, comfortable, with free wireless internet and spacious bathroom. It's virtually close to everywhere, Magnificent mile, Millenium Park, Navy Pier, etc. Bear in mind that you have to pay extra for parking. For valet it's $44 and self park is $32. Overall I'm satisfied and recommend this to anyone."
24,193,"Jul 17 2009 	Everything You Could Want	I recently spent a week at this location for business. As I traveled around Chicago during the week, and visited friends at other hotels, I confirmed again and again that the Hilton Garden Inn is the best kept secret in Chicago. Being in the River North area is perfection. The train is steps away from the front door, there is a grocery across the street (with a surprisingly good natural food section on two aisles...don't be put off by all the processed junk you see as you enter the crowded space), a Trader Joe's two blocks away, Nordstrom across the street in a mall that fronts Michigan Ave for easy bus access, and restaurants everywhere you looked. My husband was thrilled that the Chicago Jazz Mart was a block away as well as an exceptional used bookstore. Spend too much and need to mail things home? There is a post office across the street from the grocery store. It just doesn't get better than this for location. Regarding the room, it was spacious, perfectly appointed, had a great city view, and was spotless day after day. My only small complaint was the bathtub was tiny and not the kind you can lean back in...too concave....so I relaxed in the hot tub near the pool each day. I also loved the business center with three computers, printers, fax machine and copy machine. Wonderful! Regarding noise, the whole city is noisy. That's Chicago. The hotel restaurant, Weber Grill, attracts a lot of lively traffic, but so does every other restaurant in the area. The weekend crowd was noticeably rowdier than the weekday crowd. This is not a sedate hotel for retirees, if you know what I mean. Ask for a room on the upper floors and don't hesitate to call the staff if you need assistance. They were great."
25,193,"Jul 11 2009 	The staff went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful!	My family and I were traveling to Frankfurt, Germany, and wanted a nonstop flight. Because we used to live in Chicago, we decided to spend a night in Chicago before flying to Germany since we could get a nonstop flight from Chicago.We Pricelined this hotel and got two rooms for $50/each. We planned for my husband to stay in one room with one of our children while I stayed in the other room with the other child (our children are 3 and 1). We inquired about adjoining rooms, however, and found that we were able to get adjoining rooms, which made life a lot easier. Since our flight to Frankfurt the next day was late in the evening, we asked to arrange a late checkout. They were so helpful that they allowed us to stay until 2:00 p.m. so that my kids could take naps.When we checked out, we asked Kristy at the front desk if there was any way she could arrange adjoining rooms for us again on our way back and she did just that.This was potentially a stressful trip for us, but it was made so much more pleasant just by the small things that the folks at HGI were willing to do for us. Oh, and the rooms were exceptionally comfortable and well-appointed!"
26,193,"Jul 5 2009 	Thank you Hilton magnificent mile	We actually made a pitch to the Oprah show and met first in one of the convention rooms here. The wait-staff did not know who we were, but they were so professional and excellent to our business party. We were given the attention the HIlton is famous for and the chef was excellent. Front desk politely and proficiently dealt with our particular concerns. We had international investors and when a bi-lingual computer IT professional was needed, Hilton staff was very polite and assisted us."
27,193,"Jul 2 2009 	Good value for your money	I got a pretty good deal on the hotel, so overall I was pleased considering I didn't pay a lot.Good location - just off Michigan Ave and close to many bars and restaurants. The Grand subway stop is located right in front of the hotel, which is an added plus if you're to/from the airport via the train.Hotel staff was friendly.Rooms were clean.If you're planning to take a late night dip in the pool (I.e. in the last hour before the pool closes, just a warning that this seems to be the time that many families take their kids swimming (maybe to tire them out??). The hot tub just isn't quite as relaxing with a bunch of 8 year-olds splashing around beside you. : ("
28,193,Jun 16 2009 	Another great Hilton	Great location to go to city attractions. Great staff and clean rooms at a great price
29,193,"Jun 16 2009 	Nice hotel in a great location	We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn June 11-14th, 2009. This was our second stay at this location. The first stay was great as well and we really liked the great location just off Michigan Avenue. This hotel is also just off the EL redline, at the Grand Avenue stop. There are a lot of dining and drinking options within walking distance too.Check in went very quickly, no lines. The room was clean and comfortable. Good beds, not too hard, not too soft, they had some sort of adjustable feature, but not like sleep number beds, it has a knob on the side, so I'm not sure how it really worked. We were on the 17th floor and did not have much of a view but that was ok with us. We were not in the room much. The rooms are good sized for Chicago also. (Some hotel rooms can be small there.) I recommend this hotel if you plan to use public transit. It is fast and easy to use in Chicago. We took the train to Wrigley Field for a baseball game on 2 days and also to the Sears Tower and Macys. We also visited the Frontera Fresco at Macy's (on State Street, 7th floor) and even saw Rick Bayless stop in to check on his quick service restaurant! That was unexpected! I've seen him at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo before at night, but I was shocked to see him here! We also dined at Shaw's Crab House, which was very good, though we ate in the Oyster Bar, not the main dining room, which is a bit louder atmosphere, but the same food. We also found a great mini golf course in Grant Park, which was very fun, called The Green at Grant Park. You can get a beer before, during or after you play mini golf. We enjoyed listening to the Blues Fest acts across the street while we golfed. Overall, we had a great second stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Chicago and I'd stay here again."
30,193,Jun 13 2009 	Great location great hotel	Very conveniently located. Across the street from the subway and just a couple of blocks to Michigan Ave. and buses. Nordstroms and Bloomies nearby along with all kinds of great restaurants. Room was large and very clean. Had a corner room with lots of light. Staff helpful. Booked on Hotwire for $76 a night so was delighted to find such a great hotel.
31,193,"Jun 9 2009 	Sirens All Night Long!	I had stayed here previously without incident. My last stay will definitely be my last stay. I was awoken every half-hour or so by sirens. Needless to say, I did not get much sleep. Other than that small problem, the hotel and room itself was nice."
32,193,"Jun 8 2009 	Next to perfect.	Plusses outweigh the minuses by far. On the plus side:+ immediately on the red line. Could not possibly be more convenient to public transit. Literally steps away. + but you may not even need the subway as the hotel is perfectly central &amp; within easy walking distance of everything downtown.+ very fluffy bed in contemporary and meticulously clean room+ attentive and cheerful check-in staff (went extra mile for us in several respects)+ taxi stand one block away for easy trips to airport or wherever else you may be headed. Minuses:- Breakfast at Weber Grill is mediocre at best. You're better off walking a block or two to any of the surrounding restaurants. (Gospel brunch at House of Blues, for example)- pool is small. (But why swim? You're in Chicago!) - elevator wait times can be a little frustrating - building could use one more elevator. - a little pricey, I guess. Hard to say. Long story short, a lovely stay at a lovely hotel. I won't hesitate to stay here again."
33,193,"May 31 2009 	Be prepared to pay LOTS!	We stayed at this hilton on part of a package deal.Its a nice hotel, clean 2 bathrooms in our room, but The extras you have to pay are far too high. Parking $45 per day, $7.00 for a bottle of water!!!! $12 for internet!! The pool was closed for maintanance so asked if we could have a reduction on parking. We were just laughed at!"
34,193,"May 28 2009 	Mixed up beginning happy ending :)	We had an issue with making a phone reservation and not receving an email confirmation. When I decided to call to confirm our reservation the afternoon of the night we were scheduled to arrive, I was told there was no reservation under my name. Come to find out, an error had somehow been made and we were booked at a different Hilton. We were able to come to a compromise, however. This hotel is very conveniently located downtown within walking distance of many shops, restaurants....Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Pool/hottub were decent, although quite small. This was a family vacation for us and we were overall impressed with the hotel. *TIP* Park your own car for much cheaper....just park near an elevator in the parking ramp....it's the same place for valet parking!!"
35,193,"May 28 2009 	Great location; mediocre amenities	Stayed overnight here with husband and son. It's a great location in terms of being near shopping and bars and restaurants. The rooms were okay but the walls are very thin. You can hear everything. It's nothing special and there are much better hotels very nearby, including Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites."
36,193,"May 25 2009 	This place sucks	Don't stay here, the you're better off going to the adjacent hotels for a better hotel stay and are more accommodating than the Hilton. The Mariott and Hampton have been a better experience for myself and was just a little more money per night. Paper thin walls that everyone can hear you and neighbors will complain when coming back from the night. You only get one personal warning and the second time they come up they will kick you out by force. We were literally in the hotel for 30 minutes before we were told we were being kicked out. We were kicked out with excessive force by police after trying to negotiate with the manager who was stuck on kicking us out. We had 8 police officers escort people who were quiet by the time the officers came. Not worth the cost for people enjoying the city or even for business trips since everyone can hear everything. I've already told our sales force to never book any nights here and instead, we go to the Marriott now."
37,193,"May 19 2009 	First Choice when in Chicago	Whenever I'm in Chicago I try the Hilton Garden Inn first. Best Location for the &quot;L&quot;, the supermarket, and Portillo's! Rooms are spacious and staff is great!"
38,193,"May 7 2009 	Prepaid Suite Reservations But No Room At This Inn!	Oh my, I was so disappointed with my recent trip to Chicago. My sister, daughter and I had tickets to the Oprah Show. I made reservations for us to have a suite at the Hilton Garden Inn, Chicago Downtown/Magnificent Mile. I prepaid the reservation, as I wanted to guarantee that we would have our suite. We live in Cincinnati, and instead of flying, we decided to make the five hour trip by driving. I wanted to have a suite so we could have a better place to unwind. We arrived at the hotel, and I gave the valet our car, and he parked it. We went inside to check in. We were greeted promptly, and given our room keys. Off we went to see our little suite! Imagine my surprise when we opened the door to the suite, and we walked into a tiny room with two queen beds, which consumed the room. I immediately called the front desk to tell them a mistake had been made. A bad sign - it took me about five minutes to speak to someone at the front desk. The gentleman at the front desk, John, told me that I didn't have a suite reservation. I then told him I had written confirmation, and that I had prepaid - which the check-in person had already noted that I had prepaid my room. &quot;John&quot; said that the room that I was in was just as good as a suite, and I should be happy there. WHAT???? I told him I was not happy, as we had three adults, and I had advised that three adults were staying there in my online reservation request, and then I learned the truth. All of the suites were taken. I told John that I wanted him to find me another suite in another hotel. John said o.k., and about ten minutes later, I called back downstairs, and he told me that he had miraculously been able to get a room at the Embassy Suites, and we were so lucky!!! So, the three of us head downstairs to be taken to the Embassy Suites. This jerk is at the front desk when we go downstairs, and he is trying to ignore us. The young man who checked us in asked us, &quot;Is there a problem with your room?&quot; And I told him, &quot;Yes, we don't have a room, as my suite has evidently been given away, even though I prepaid for the suite.&quot; That young man was apologetic, and he asked who we had spoken to. Then the rude guy, John, comes over, and says, &quot;Go over to the Embassy Suites, turn right, and it is about a block down.&quot; Did I mention it was pouring rain???? So we walk through the rain, and go check in at the Embassy Suites. They request a credit card, so I give them my Amex, which they promptly charge the &quot;suite.&quot; The next day when we check out, we have to traipse back over to the Hilton from the Embassy, with our luggage in tow, to re-claim our car from valet parking. Nice, huh? I have to go back inside the Hilton so that they can do a separate charge for the valet parking, but I can't seem to get anyone to issue me a credit for the suite that I had prepaid for. I called the Hilton tonight, and I talked to someone who told me to leave a vm for the manager. I have now left her a vm, and I am awaiting a phone call to see what remedy is available for me. I am so disgusted by this hotel's treatment of their guests. Unbelievable!We did eat at two terrific restaurants, and I will review them separately. They were Weber's Grill and Shaw's Restaurant/Seafood. Yummy!"
39,193,"May 1 2009 	main downtown	Amazing deal $54 a nyt , worth every bit of it."
40,193,"Apr 15 2009 	clean convenient and comfortable in Chicago	Stayed here for 5 nights at end of March. Had a price of $98 a night for the family. Found maid service to be great- even picked up some of my kid's toys/stuffed animals they had laid around. Bought an all day bus/train pass at Jewel Osco across the street and very easy to get around. Also join your local science museum at home and it got us free reciprical access to Museum of Science and Industry, Field Museum, Alder planetarium, and children museum at Navy Pier.Pros- Super location- within walking distance to Mich. avenue, El train line right at corner, bus stop close, grocery store and many restaurants/shopping within one or two blocks. Valet parking was high like most hotels in area but self parking (no in or out) was $29 a day which is cheaper than other hotels nearby. Microwave and refrig in room. Neutragena toiletries. Flat screen tv. Small but adequate pool and hot tub. Business center had free internet access which came in handy.Cons- Suzette at the front desk wasn't the most informative or friendly but she wasn't there everyday either thankfully and 2 out of 3 elevators were broken on the Sunday morning we tried to check out -more than 20 minutes just trying to leave the building but maid was nice enough to let us on the working freight elevator."
41,193,"Mar 29 2009 	Overall great place	My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon - mostly to catch some Cubs games. We mostly chose this hotel for its proximity to the Red Line - it is directly outside the front doors. We had a very friendly check-in and our room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom had great toiletries and the beds were very comfortable. The pool was small but clean and included a hot tub. The business center had free internet and the valet guys outside were always VERY friendly and helpful. One of them even walked in the pouring rain for 15 minutes to get us a cab!A couple suggestions though: if street noise might bother you, request a room on a higher floor. There is no continental breakfast, but there is a Jewel/Osco right across the street (great because you have an in-room fridge). Parking is also steep - $40/day."
42,193,"Mar 21 2009 	Front desk had an attitude over the phone and hung up on me	I was running a little late checking out so I called the front desk to ask for 30 minutes more to check out. The woman at the front desk said she had to pull up my reservation first. Then she asked me how i was going to pay for the valet parking (which I never had in the first place). After explaining to her that I self parked, with an attitude she told me that the hotel was fully booked and not to take any longer than 30 mins. (As if everyone is really rushing to Chicago right now for some reason!?) Anyways, as I was saying &quot;thank you&quot; just to be polite, she hung up on me. I stayed there 2 days and after the first night, the room wasn't cleaned until late afternoon. Also, the first day we found old drinks in the refrigerator that had already expired. The room directory is outdated and not specific."
43,193,"Mar 20 2009 	Great Location and Good Value	We just returned from a few nights at the Hilton Garden Inn. Its pluses: It's right on the Red Line which makes getting around super easy. The pool, though small, is located on the 12th floor and has a great view of the city. The room was clean, had a fridge and a microwave. I recommend the Jewel/Osco mini mart across the street on State Street for nibbles or morning bakery.Minuses? The room by the elevator and ice machine was very noisy and there's all the big city siren noise. Ask for a room further down the hall to eliminate that."
44,193,Mar 16 2009 	Not a bad hotel but noisy	We booked this hotel through Priceline and got a good price for 3 nights.Here are the Pros:-Nice small pool and whirlpool-Clean rooms-Friendly staff-Business Center-Great downtown location right off the redline subwayCons:-No extra perks like free breakfast-Rooms are a bit smaller-The major drawback is the sound noise. The hotel hallways and room doors are not insulated at all so you can hear everything from outside your room and noise that travels from one room to the next via the hall. That was the worst part of our stay.-If the noise issue was resolved somehow it would have been much better.
45,193,"Mar 3 2009 	A Great Hotel!!	I just got back from a dental convention in Chicago and decided to stay at this Hilton Garden Inn. Let me start by saying this hotel is perfectly located in the heart of downtown, close to the red line train, shopping and numerous great places to eat. The check in was polite and fast. I got up to my room and was surprised how clean and modern the room was. Flat screen T.V. king size foam bed, comfortable enough for me but if you like a bed that is on the firm side you may not like this one. The room also had a fridge and microwave which was nice! The bathroom was spotless! There were two concerns though, one was the common halls had an echo and some guests don't seem to think of others at one o' clock in the morning yelling slamming doors etc. Second the AC/HEATING UNIT kept coming on for 10 or 15 seconds at a time all through the night! Annoying! And very loud! This was after I switched it off! After the first night I went down to the front desk to notify them of this problem and they sent somebody up to the room(I guess while I was out) to try to fix this, but the second and last night I stayed the same problem happened again. The front desk staff did ask me if the problem was fixed but after I said &quot;No&quot; she didn't seem to care to much. I would recommend this hotel if your a &quot;deep sleeper.&quot;"
46,193,"Mar 2 2009 	Great location clean and stylish rooms free Wi-Fi	I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn recently with some extended family for a weekend in Chicago. I will definitely be back. The rooms are a great value and the Free wireless internet is great. The rooms are nicely appointed for a midrange chain with updated furniture, Aeron desk chairs, comfortable beds with clean white duvet covers, and flat screen TV's. (see my photographs) They have an extended cable line up including HGTV. There is a microwave and refrigerator (not a mini-bar) in each room--it is right across the street from a grocery store. No safe provided. Wi-Fi is free and works well. The pool is small and there is a whirlpool. The fitness center contains a few basic machines; there was a sign on the door saying free guest passes were available to Crunch fitness a block away. There is a parking garage right next to the hotel...self parking was about 25 per day...a bargain for downtown Chicago. The hotel is right in the River North district, two blocks off Michigan Avenue. Close to River North restaurants and nightlight. Near Nordstroms for shopping. Weber Grill restaurant is just off the lobby. I would recommend this hotel."
47,193,"Feb 27 2009 	Great location beautiful hotel and rooms great value in winter	We enjoyed this hotel this winter. The location is magnificent, 2 blocks from the Michigan Ave., less than 20 meters to the Red Line MTA train that takes you virtually everywhere. Nice view (floor 17). The pool is very good and also the business center (complimentary use of PC and printer). Within the hotel there is free wifi."
48,193,"Feb 15 2009 	Average HGI in a Great Location	Let's start with the new HGI mattress which is foam, offers little bounce, and is, overall very stiff and partially contouring. It was right up my alley, and one of the more comfortable beds in the Hilton chain, but if you're a soft bed sleeper you're going to have real problems with the standard issue mattress at this and every other HGI.The room is clean and quality. The noon checkout time is a significant perk for those of us who are not early risers.The front desk will tell you the breakfast ends at 10:30 when it actually ends at 10. Not something you want to find out at 10:05 a.m.Not a big fan of the Weber Grill restaurant, personally but you could do worse for dinner on a bad weather/late night.Great location, helpful, polite front desk staff.While the room walls are soundproof, the pass through and external doors are not.Aside from a non functioning smoke alarm (somewhat disturbing to have it hanging off the wall), this is an average HGI that isn't overpriced with a great location and nice views.One other important note. The room is very, very dry. If you stay at this hotel and require a somewhat humid room for either health reasons or a cold, I'd recommend a humidifier."
49,193,"Feb 10 2009 	Location and Efficiency	I booked the hotel in Hotwire after seen that I could get a room for $56 a night. I had a reservation at one of the Marriots and decided to save the $30 difference per night.I have been to Chicago several times and I have stayed in different hotels, and I really enjoyed my stay here. The location is the best. You can walk everywhere. If you need to get around, the &quot;Grand&quot; station of the Red line of the L is literally at the hotel's door. My room was very clean, and it was very comfortable for relaxing as well as for working. The heat worked perfectly. Front desk staff was efficient. The housekeeping staff was extremely nice. One thing that I really appreciate is the room's refrigerator, coffee maker and microwave. There is a grocery store across the street. From the hotel you can walk any where: shopping , theater, Navy Pier, Park, etc.Cons:There is construction near by, and the hotel is about a block from the fire station, so there is some noise. Some how a lot of the guests do not realize that the metal doors of the rooms are probably a required for safety purposes and do not need to be slammed, and you can hear people talking on the halls, specially the typical screaming children, but I this is not the hotel fault.I will definitely recommend it, and I will stay there again if I can. It is not ultimate luxury, but it gets the work done flawlessly if efficiency and location at a reasonable price is what you are looking for."
50,193,"Feb 4 2009 	Very Nice!	The Hilton Garden Inn was pretty much perfect. The staff were very friendly, the room was well appointed, and the location (right next to the red line and in the middle of River North) is excellent. It was nice to be at a hotel that doesn't nickel and dime you - wireless internet access was free. I didn't need to use the 24 hour pantry in the lobby, but I was glad it was there if I did. The pool was small, however, and the fitness equipment was aging. Overall it was a great stay!"
51,193,"Jan 28 2009 	Its an ordinary Hilton ...but she's in danger of slipping...	Sorry late review...catching up...I normally stay at the Intercontinental ( more out of habit and familiarity ) but was unable to get in there ...so booked in a hotel nearby as time was against me. As others have written ( honestly and truthfully may I add ) location is just right. You have everything you need at your doorstep ...shops , restaurants, red route, the lively Rush and Division, river., cabs.....you name it. As a Hotel?...it does what it says...supplies a place to sleep. It's clean..room has all the bits a hotel room should have ...service is fine...staff do what they can and as effeciently as they can... Yes there were small gripes.. and if you are a well tarvelled person the little things can really rub on you ...I had them....You seem to wait an eternity for a lift... yes the air con is louder than normal ...but all in all...it isn't such a bad place. Budget or ''deals'' will sway the ordinary traveller as to whether he/she stays there or not. Luck and timing will depend on whether the stay was good or not."
52,193,"Jan 7 2009 	Great Location....Poor Service	Let me start by saying I am a frequent traveler and have stayed at locations from various hotel brands around the world. I also am a former Hilton Diamond Member.I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years, with the last stay having some major issues. The stay was so bad, Hilton sent a voucher to come again for a free nights stay. I let it expire and just recently decided to give the hotel a second try for a 9 night stay.Hotel Positives: Great location. Two blocks from Michigan Avenue, 1 block from State St. A grocery across the street, 1 1/2 blocks to Starbucks, and some fabulous restaurants within 3 blocks. Also, the red line is just out the front door for easy city transport.Hotel Negatives:Customer service, poor room cleaning, poor management.Before arriving, I called and told the manager that my last experience here was subpar and I was coming back and would like a smooth, stress free stay. The manager offered to honor the free night even though it was expired. Here is a snapshot of the stay:1st night; Heater was broken and made a clanking noise every 26 seconds the whole night.2nd day: The hotel had many key problems and issues. Enough to send apology letters out.3rd day.....okay4th day:Verbally insulted, lied to, and hung up on by April over a newspaper. Asked to speak with manager, she refused...said she couldn't leave a note for the manager unless she was told what about. Hung up on!!Spoke with manager about the matter, only to have him smirk and have very unprofessional demeanor.5th day: the room was half cleaned. Arrived at night to a room with a dirty sink and toilet, no towels, dirty glasses, no toiletries. Called down and asked, and in return received towels, cups, and a bag of coffee/cream6th day:Return to the room in evening to again find an uncleaned room. Towels were left on bed..not in bathroom.7th day: okay8th day; Room partially cleaned again. No towels again!9th day: Went to check out and took the voucher down to be credited. Two managers had said they would be glad to honor it evn though it had expired. Gave it to Ronnie at the front desk, she said she would credit it. Two hours later, go to check out and notice it was never taken off. She then says it can't be used, even though 2 managers said they would take it. (It was their offer, not mine as I had said it was expired.....and only wanted a SMOOTH stay). Spend 1 hour arguing over the fact that they were renegging. Finally had to call Hilton Corporate, who then called the hotel and made them credit the voucher.After all this, never did get a formal apology and never heard from the GM....only shift managers. Very poor service. Yes, the location is great, but Embassy Suites is across the street (1 block) and Homewood Suites are 1 block as well. Stay at one of those"
53,193,"Dec 29 2008 	Excellent Stay	Excellent hotel and location. Walking distance to many attractions. Close to the Red line subway. $30.00 taxi ride from Midway, always cabs available outside of Hilton Garden Inn. Front desk people were more than helpful. They were intelligent, polite and knowledgeable. Portillos hotdogs/beef sandwiches about 3 blocks away. Starbucks outside and across the street, grocery store across the street. The rooms were clean and nice, beds were comfortable, tv was nice flat screen. All and all just the best place to stay with the best rates. Also a PF Changs right there too."
54,193,"Nov 26 2008 	Has taken a slide in quality	This used to be my favorite hotel in Chicago. However some recent stays with some issues has caused me to change my thoughts.You can't beat the location just a few blocks off Michigan Ave. Right across the street is a Jewel/Osco grocery store. Tons of restaurant options and the Red Line EL stop is right outside the front doors.They've also done some remodeling with new carpet and wallpaper in the hallways. Plus they've installed 37&quot; HDTVs in the rooms. However all they have is standard definition, and it looks bad.Plus the AC/heating units are showing their age. It's hard to maintain a comfortable temperature plus they are extremely loud.Plus the internet (both wired and wireless) was down. The front desk didn't apologize and said it would be fixed in a few days.Lastly getting our room serviced was an issue a couple of times even though we were gone by 9am and didn't return until late."
55,193,"Nov 24 2008 	Wonderful!	I booked this hotel based on the tripadvisor recs and my previous experiences with HGI. I was quite pleased with my choice. First, there is the red line right outside the door. Nordstrom's is to your left and a full service Starbucks to the right. It was within walking distance of magnificent mile-an easy walk to all stores and afun walk to Grant Park.The hotel has room service and a small Starbucks downstairs. The rooms are a nice size with very comfortable beds with comfort adjustable mattresses(for the king anyway). Staff was veryvfriendly and so helpful. You can't go wrong staying here."
56,193,"Nov 24 2008 	great location and convienent	just returned from a convention in Chicago and we stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn. I read through the Trip Advisor tips and was very happy with this hotel. we took the CTA train in from O'Hare and (blue line then switch to red line) and the Grand Station stop is right at the hotel. Our room was perfect-microwave and niced size dorm refrig. the grocery store across the street is a full size store (vs convenience store) and we were able to buy breakfast and sandwich fixings for our stay-HUGE $ savings from buying items at the convention site. They have a nice business center with 4 complimentary computers and printers. we were able to print concert tickets, directions, etc. very nice. The hotel is a short walk to Michigan Ave (3-4 half blocks). I am looking forward to planning a non business trip to Chicago and we will definitely stay at this hotel again!!"
57,193,"Nov 1 2008	Love this hotel!	This is our place to stay while in Chicago for sure. Just returned from our first stay at this hotel. Very friendly staff, basic King room was fantastic and extraordinarily clean, the beds are super comfortable and what a great view. Get a high floor if possible. We had to check out early for unexpected emergency at home and the staff was very understanding and compassionate. Weber Grill Restaurant off the lobby is very good and busy. Get there early."
58,193,"Sep 29 2008 	Great Stay	When traveling to Chicago we usually stay near the airport because it is cheaper. Decided to stay downtown, and the Hilton had very good rates compared to similar hotels. Staff was very friendly and efficient. Room was nice, and the kids enjoyed the pool while I made use of the whirlpool. You can self park next door with the validated rate of $26/day vs. $44 to valet. The hotel is a perfect location, near enough to Michigan Ave to walk, and a Red Line subway stop in front of the hotel. I would have liked to have a breakfast included with the room... that was the only draw back."
