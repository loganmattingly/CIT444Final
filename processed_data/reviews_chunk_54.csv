165,1230,"Sep 28 2004	Tiniest Rooms - Unfriendly Staff - Good Location	1st night room was crammed with 3 single beds, noisy lower level, subway and kitchen noise. Completely unacceptable!! Next room - still tiny, seemed to be cleaned although I felt the need to check bed and bathroom every time I entered the room. Bar is tiny, old and bartender awfully unfriendly - bottles old!! It is in every sense a BUDGET hotel although NOT INEXPENSIVE!Will not return."
166,1230,"Sep 28 2004	Do not stay here!!!!	We arrived at Hyde Park Towers and thought it looked very nice but when we were given our room i almost cried....it was tiny, horrible and very dirty. The bed wasnt even a full size double, there was mould on the mirror and lampshade and the room was very dull. Every time a train went through the underground the room shook (basically every 5mins). We opened the curtain to let air through the window but found a brick wall. At night time we came back to the sound of a generator outside the room which created even more constant noise. The night porter was however very nice and switched rooms for us which did turn out to be much better. It is convenient to the tube and shops but there are much better hotels out there."
167,1230,"Sep 21 2004	Bad hotel good location	I've stayed in this hotel for 5 days, in september 2004. the location is good: very close to the subway (Circle and District lines just around the corner and Central Line at the end of the road, 3/5 minutes distance), lots of restaurants (queensway is a busy street). Our room was really (and I mean REALLY) tiny and unbelievable small, with an equally small bathroom. during our stay, we could saw some better (and larger) twin rooms that face the front of the hotel (120, for example, on the 1st floor) that could be a much better option. besides that, the staff was friendly, and the breakfast was aceptable. i'll give it a ** just for the location, and if all you need is a safe/clean place to sleep then I guess this is a &quot;not-so-bad&quot; choice."
168,1230,"Sep 11 2004	Do not stay here!	This hotel was booked for us through Creative Holidays in Australia. We were very dissapointed with the hotel overall. Rooms were small, everything seemed to hard for the staff, there appeared to be huge morale problems amongst the staff as they were often arguing with each other in front of customers etc, there was limited access to the bar, restaurant &amp; so called coffee shop. The nearby tube station created huge noise in our room and every time a train passed, we woke up!Despite advertising, the check in time was 1500hrs (3pm) not 2pm and when we arrived at 1pm (after a 13hr flight, we were told to go away and come back at 3pm!!We do not recommend this hotel to any tourist."

1,1231,dreadful food	We haven't stayed at the inn but used to eat there regularly. It was very special. I think the main chef has left because the food is terrible now. What a shame.
2,1231,"Nov 1 2009 	We loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it	This is an old pub that has been refurbished beautifully and in a very modern but homely style. We stayed 4 nights in a family room when we came back from USA for a family wedding in the area. We have 3 very young children and they all stayed in the family room with us. It was not huge (this is London after all) but it was plenty big enough for us. The pub is gorgeous and the food is great. The staff are all immensely friendly and helpful, and made us feel like this was a second home. It is walking distance to Kew Gardens. Only a minutes walk to the tube and cute shops and restaurants. You can get into London in 20 minutes, Richmond in 10 minutes. Close to M4 and other major roads. Only drawback is no easy parking, especially during the week, when the area is zoned.We are hoping to go back next month and would recommend it to anybody visiting the area for fun, or staying for business who wants easy access to London but wants to stay somewhere more casual than a soul-less hotel. Come here and experience the best pub culture of the UK, mingle with locals and truely relax."
3,1231,"Oct 16 2008 	Pleasant little Inn	We stayed at the Inn at Kew Gardens last month for a friend's wedding. The location of the hotel is great. It's in a quiet neighborhood - very close to the train station. Has lots of good little restaurants within walking distance and there's a little dry cleaners/laundry place right next door (quite convenient I thought).The hotel has been refurbished. Our room (the &quot;Larkspur&quot;) was a decent size - as was the bathroom. Overall, the room was clean and comfortable. Mind you, there are no lifts at this hotel...so be prepared to get a good work out on the stairs :)The rooms are above a public house. The pub has a very laid-back atmosphere with lots of friendly locals. It serves great food (my favorite was the &quot;Inn Burger&quot;...it's literally quite a mouth full!!). Breakfast is also served downstairs in the pub. It comprises of a small buffet (juices, milk, cereals &amp; fruit) along with a hot breakfast prepared to your liking.And in case you're wondering...once upstairs we never heard anything from the pub. The only 'noise' came from the airplanes flying overhead.The staff at the Inn are wonderful. EVERYONE was very helpful, courteous and friendly (Thank you Lucy, Andy, Martin, Theo, Billy and everyone else who's name I've regretfully forgotten) :(We definitely had a pleasant stay at the Inn at Kew Gardens."
4,1231,"Jun 2 2008	Basic	We stopped one night and the general rooms look good but not very clean, i think they forgot the duster and the rooms at the back of the hotel fill with the smells from the kitchen and get very hot."
5,1231,"Dec 21 2007	Christmas drinks rip-off	If you visit this hotel, make sure that you check their price list before you order anything. I recently paid a visit with a group of friends. I ordered two drinks, a pint of bitter and a glass of mulled wine. When the the barman said that will be 8, I thought I'd miss-heard. When he brought us mince pies, I thought this was because he felt guilty for charging us so much. Then it turned out the pies were included in the price.I hadn't ordered mince pies, neither did I want them as we were about to go for dinner at an excellent nearby Nepalese restaurant Rara. When I complained the next day to the manager, he wrote me a polite response and offered a refund.However, he clearly had no interest in my point of view, and no-doubt wished he could have said something more blunt. He appeared to have no respect for my opinion that his staff needed a little extra training.The moral of this is to be very cautious before placing an order, or better still, go somewhere else."
6,1231,"Oct 27 2007 	Above the pub	The hotel is a 3 storey recently refurbished hotel on top of a public house. It is very convenient for Kew Gardens and the M3. Also Richmond Park. There are 19 rooms, well renovated with contemporary furniture and bathrooms. Rooms are a bit small and dark and slightly stuffy but comfortable. The hotel is very clean. There is no lift so not suitable for those with a disability. We were on the first and third floors but there was no noise from the pub or planes directly above on their final approach to Heathrow. Breakfast was freshly and individually prepared - very good. Staf were pleasant and helpful. Overall the stay represented Value for Money."
7,1231,Nov 17 2009 	Ganz nett mehr aber auch nicht.
1,1234,"Cool chic comfortable and central.	Enjoyed a 2 night 'theatre break' in the City and well pleased with our choice of hotel. Has benefited greatly from refurbishment and we enjoyed an 'Upgrade' at check-in. Beautifully appointed room, (view onto back of a church but we weren't there for a view!)with nice sleek minimalistic lines. Very pleasant staff. Got a good deal through website booking and found location ideal - easy walk to Covent Garden and Theatreland."
2,1234,Nov 2 2009 	Excellent modern hotel in great location	Stayed at the Thistle on a theatre break for our anniversary. Wasn't sure what to expect but was not disappointed. The hotel has undergone a refurbishment and the rooms were spacious and furnished to a high standard. Great location - 10-15 min walk to covent garden and nearby theatres and 5 mins to the British Museum. There are also various bars/restaurants nearby. Breakfast was buffet style with full english/continental available along with tea/coffee/juice. Staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay at this hotel again.
3,1234,"Oct 30 2009 	Great Hotel and Location	Service when we arrived was very efficient and the staff were very polite and helpful. The room was one of the best i have stayed in it's very modern and trendy with a good size LCD telly. The only slight let down was the windows did not open and as the weather was very mild for the time of year the room was quite hot, there was AC but it was faulty, but a concierge did come up and managed to open one window slightly and he was very helpful. Meals at the hotel were very expensive, so we ate out.The location was ideal central to the main parts of London and the tube is only a short distance away, i would advise you to get a day pass as it works out cheaper if you are going to be using the tube alot otherwise for every trip you take on the tube it will cost you 4.00 and it is going up so will be even dearer. The tubes get very busy between 5pm-7pm so try and avoid these times if you can.London it's self is a very busy place but also enjoyable, there are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to eat from your local back street cafes to the posh nosh eateries. Would not recommend Planet Hollywood the food was awful and looked and tasted cheap i did complain and so did other people, for the price you would expect it to be of good quality but it was anything but!!!.On a whole had a fab stay and would recommend this hotel for all."
4,1234,"Oct 20 2009 	Love this Hotel and Location	I stayed at the Kingsley in March with my mom and Aunt for Sring Break in March 2009. I have been to London several times but this was the best trip. The hotel is walking distance to the tube and shopping. I love shopping on Oxford Street and I could walk to Oxford from the hotel. Of course you can take a taxi or the bus but you can also walk so you can spend more euros on shopping. There is this great hamburger place down the way from the hotel. As an American I don't think the food is that great in London but this burger was big, good, and juicy. I highly recommend this hotel because of it's location and I forgot...it's newly renovated so it's real modern. I'll definitely be back next spring break!!!"
5,1234,"Oct 7 2009 	What a pleasant surprise	We go to London a couple of times each year and are accustomed to very disappointing hotels with tiny rooms. The Kingsley was a complete exception although I suspect we had a room upgrade.The hotel was recently refurbished in an impressive boutique style using very high quality fittings, our room was excellent with a huge comfy bed, flat screen TV, armchair, desk etc. It was completely quiet. The bathroom was crisp, modern and very well equipped.The included breakfast buffet provided all you can eat full English or continental in a good surroundings with enthusiastic staff doing coffee and toast etc.We did not sample much of the other service so can't really comment. The hotel is a few steps from Bloomsbury square where we parked the car. This is a nice part of London. Great value for money and a pleasure to stay there."
6,1234,"Oct 2 2009 	What a great hotel in a great location!!	Only stayed for one night, but was very impressed with quality of staff, service and room. Ideally located, close to tube stations, and close to theatreland, the main reason for our stay. Room was ideal, very modern, clean and comfortable (514) . Only downside was lack of hot water for a full bath/shower, but not a big issue on a one night stay.Breakfast was great, one of the best in any hotel i have stayed in.Would thoroughly recommened to others, and would definately return again."
7,1234,Sep 29 2009 	Brilliant! Great location clean and very friendly staff.	I would definately recommend this to my friends and we are going to use this for our base whenever we visit London. The location was within easy walking distance from all of the main attractions and ideal for those wishing to visit the theatre during their stay. The room was 'cosy' but ample big enough for a base and very clean.The tea and coffee is in the drawer and you can always ask for more at reception they are very obliging.
8,1234,"Sep 22 2009 	excellent value for money	Paid 112 for a double (room 206) on a on line distributor the night before...- this room was located at front of building on only 2nd floor but good sound proofing assured this was not a problem. Large room, with lots of room to move around the king sized bed; Recently renovated inthe usual clean line, trendy look; large bath with good shower; Located a short walk from the Tottenham Court Rd tube, and several short streets from bus lines, so good for transport in central London.... did not use the breakfast or bar so no omments there....I was really pleased given how tiny so many London hotel rooms are....I'll stay again..."
9,1234,"Sep 16 2009 	Good value hotel	We booked this hotel (after much searching!), due to its location and the deal we got off Laterooms.com - 79 a night. It was an absolute bargain!!! The hotel was immaculate, all being newly refurbished, and the location was fantastic - just 5-10 mins walk to Covent Garden, Leicester square, Trafalgar square, and Holborn tube station. Our room was on their 'mezzanine' level, which is their posh way of saying &quot;down at the bottom with absolutely no view&quot;, but we weren't there to stay in our room all day. The room was very well presented, lovely bathroom, TV, Ironing board &amp; iron (very handy), extra pillows, and the tea tray (which is in the drawer so make sure you don't miss it!). Would gladly stay here again."
10,1234,"Sep 15 2009 	GREAT GREAT HOTEL!	Fantastic staff, fantastic room (completely refurnished) and fantastic location made our stay in London so great. I have been several times in London and never received such a nice service in an hotel. Theatres, Museums, Bars,Restaurants etc... all are just outside ot at the corner! I do hope they will keep it at these rates to keep it affordable so we can come back... We just loved it!!!!. Special thanks to Beatriz (chef reception) and staff for her great help and kindness."
11,1234,"Aug 31 2009 	Impressed	Chose this hotel based on proximity to theatre (for Oliver) and of course trip advisor reviews which are always pretty accurate. We were really impresssed, the hotel is fresh, classy and modern, loved the elegant staircase with its purple carpet and chandeliers, made you feel good just walking down it! Room was very comfortable and excellent bathroom. Just a 5-10 walk down Drury Lane to theatre and covent garden markets which were great, lots of free entertainment, never used the tube at all. Parked car in secure underground car park just round corner in Bloomsbury Square, 20 for 24 hours, you can walk to lots of shops and bars so its a great location. Tip; tea tray in drawer, we didnt find till leaving."
12,1234,"Aug 26 2009 	fine for a night not for a week	this is an OK hotel, paid 130 a night incl VAT for a double room with full breakfast. Room was OK, nice bathroom with Power shower. room and it's contents were clean. Enough room for a night with just a small bag and a few clothes, would not want to stay in it much longer due to lack of space."
13,1234,"Aug 24 2009 	Very good for the price refurbished and excellent location	This hotel was very good - it's been recently refurbished and the standard in the bedrooms, bar and restaurant shows this. Beds were extremely comfortable, we slept well and it was very quiet in the room, possibly because we were up a short flight of stairs with only one room next to us. The location was great - very close to the British museum, theatres, decent pubs so we didn't need to travel on the underground for our 2 days stay. We were even able to walk to embankment and get a boat trip to St Katherine's Dock which was lovely.The only real negative about the hotel was the breakfast - quite disappointing buffet breakfast with a limited and lukewarm selection of food. Would not have paid for this if it hadn't been included as part of the room rate."
14,1234,"Aug 18 2009 	Lovely Hotel in Ideal Location for Theatres	Booked a week before stay and was quoted 89 B&amp;B, which I thought was excellent. On arrival we were greeted with a warm friendly welcome and upgraded to a junior suite, which was superb. Hotel only a 15 minute walk from our theatre, which was great.Breakfast to start was a little on the slow side and had to wait for cooked items to be brought out, but at least we knew they were fresh!!Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone visiting theatreland."
15,1234,Aug 17 2009 	Super hotel in wonderful location for West end theatre break	We have just returned from a weekend stay at the Kingsley by Thistle and had a first class experience all round. The location is walking distance to all the main attractions and theatres. We booked with West End Theatre breaks who recomended this hotel as being suitable for families. Our two rooms on the floor five were spotlessly clean. The beds were comfortable and linen changed daily together with the towels. All staff were curtious and effiecient. Couldn't have asked for more. Breakfast was buffet style and the staff were lovely ensuring that all of the needs of the family were met. I will definately stay at this hotel again.
16,1234,"Aug 16 2009 	CLASSY CENTRAL CUSTOMER FRIENDLY HOTEL - GREAT STAY	We booked this hotel for a 2 night stay for a group of 6 (3 over 40's, 1 x 18yrs, 1 x 15yrs, 1 x 14yrs). We were informed that it had just had a major refurb, but I did see some photos on Trip Advisor of customers who had stayed there recently and were in the &quot;old&quot; rooms, so I was hoping that wasn't the case with us. No need to worry on that - our rooms were absolutely fantastic. The smallest of the 3 went to the 14 and 15 year old (there is always a pecking order!), but it was a very nice small room. I've put some pictures on of our room (double) and the other twin with a lovely window seat, this one being the biggest of the three. Everything was in the room, tea/coffee, hairdryer, ironing board and iron hung up in the wardrobe! We arrived at the hotel from Kings Cross (nearest tube is Holborn, take Piccadilly line to Holborn station and then a 0.2 mile walk to hotel or Tottenham Court Road, Piccadilly line to Holborn, change onto Central line - red - to Tottenham Court Road making it a 0.3 mile walk to the hotel if you feel like stretching your legs a little longer). When you walk in, the hotel has a lovely light, modern feel. We checked-in before 12 noon with the intention of leaving our cases for a couple of hours whilst we went shopping on Oxford Street, about 10/15 min walk from the hotel. One of our three rooms was ready, so the very lovely lady who checked us in, let us go to the room where we freshened up, left our bags and took off for a few hours. We were back at the Kingsley for 4.30ish, showered, chilled out for a while and then out by 7pm for our night out at the Medieval Banquet at St Katharine's Dock, Tower Bridge. A taxi would have been around 30 one way (because there were 6 of us, this was a problem in London as they only do cabs for 5 passengers, so we would have to order two cabs), so we decided to use the tube. You can get the 5.60 off peak adult ticket which allows unlimited travel on the tube within zones 1 and 2 up to 4am the next day. We bought 4 x 5.60 tickets and the kids were just 1 each. A bit of a walk from the tube at Tower Hill to the venue, but it was a lovely evening, so if you leave the high heels at home for the night, you're ok walking. Medieval Night - we paid 31 for the four adults and the teenage boys were free, so not a bad deal for us. The price includes a four course meal and unlimited wine (red or white, no rose on offer) and John Smith's bitter, the kids had unlimited coke/lemonade too. We arrived at 7.45pm as requested on our tickets, but the wine and beer don't come out until 8.15pm, so it was a cash bar for half an hour, something to bear in mind. The meal isn't a culinary experience, very, very basic, but it was edible and to be fair, the evening was more about joining in with the cast and your group. We really enjoyed the night, it was a good laugh and I think for the price we paid, it was very good value. I would recommend it - the cast really make the effort to get everyone in the mood of the theme which they did very well. Naomi was our &quot;wench&quot; for the evening and she was good fun, looked after us very well :) - a good night.The breakfast at the hotel was lovely, buffet style, always replenshed as soon as anything ran low and everything you could want as far as choice was concerned. Nothing too much trouble.Our second day was at London Zoo - Holborn tube to Oxford Circus, change to the Bakerloo line for Regent's park. You can take a bus from outside the tube station (using your tube ticket) or if you fancy a walk, it's about 25 mins through Regent's park. We got 20% off the price of the tickets using a leaflet we'd picked up, so have a look around for these in the hotel etc. We got the bus to a tube station and just hopped on back to Holborn, out by 7 again for Priscilla Queen of the Desert which was a 10 min walk from the hotel if you can read a map, or you can completely go in the opposite direction and then hail a cab to get you there! I can recommend this musical - absolutely brilliant, fantastic music, the whole cast were outstanding and the audience all joined in. I loved it, the atmosphere was amazing. The guy who plays Felicia stole the show for us. I say us - the two boys in our group didn't know what had hit them, hilarious. Anyway, if you're looking for a musical with the feel-good factor, this is it. The best night out at the theatre I've had in a long time. Walked back to the hotel this time, 10 mins.We could check out as late at 12 noon, but we were packed and out by 10.30am, left our bags with the Concierge until 3.30pm so we could have another walk around as my legs hadn't completely gone numb yet, so we bought the off-peak tube tickets again and made our way to Covent Garden, had a wander, stopped to have a couple of lunchtime glasses of wine, back on the tube to Regent Street, went to the Vodka Icebar, not a good idea for us for lunch. We were led downstairs into BelowZero and I felt like we were in a dungeon, quite oppresive so we decided to just have our drinks and left to find somewhere a bit more suitable for lunch. Bit of celebrity spotting - saw Ian from Strictly Come Dancing (dances with Camilla) shopping, not rehearsing for the next series of SCD. Made our way to Leicester Square, into Chinatown and had a bite to eat and then back on the tube to the Kingsley for our bags and then onto King's Cross for our 4.30pm train to Leeds. So, we would definitely recommend the Kingsley Thistle Hotel - great location for most attractions, lovely rooms, breakfast very nice indeed and the service from the staff was outstanding, very friendly and helpful. Loved it."
17,1234,Jul 6 2009 	Great hotel	Stayed here after a mix up with our booking for another hotel (not related to this hotel or chain at all) arrived very late. checked into a large king room with my sister - we had to a bed with my sister - although the bed was huge and this did not matter at all - it was so big I could barely see her!!room and bathroom clean and tidy - slept very well even though our room was at the front - could barely hear the road noise. check in and check out simple.
18,1234,"Jul 6 2009 	Ticks all the boxes good choice	After reading the previous reviews I was quite worried about what to expect when I booked here, but I heard about the revamp and had my fingers crossed that I would get a new room.Pleasantly surprised when I got there. Location is excellent. It is very near Covent Garden (I noticed a review where someone complained that it was 20 mins walk...they must have taken the 'scenic route' as it is no more than 10 mins slow walk).Service was simple but good. Got a refurbished room in the fifth floor which was lovely (although small, but it is London after all!). There was no minibar, but there is room service (even though the menu does not give you the tel number!), big flat screen with all the usual channels, and a clean bathroom with usual mod cons.By London standards it was good value (we stayed Fri &amp; Sat night and got it for 140 per night incl tax). Concierge was very helpful with directions, arranging a taxi and recommendations for places to go.Overall a good choice for central London - simple, functional, good value, great location."
19,1234,"Jun 27 2009 	Great location and good revamp	On the third floor in a new refurb - more than acceptable for the price (114 for a Friday night booked on the Monday). Was a twin room and when we arrived the beds were next to each other. Given we were friends but not that friendly :-) we moved them apart - which was easy as they were light.The room was quite small but that did not bother us as were down for the ACDC concert at Wembley. Checked in at 2pm (room was ready) and met up with other friends in the bar and the out for a few beers and didnt return till 12 hours later at 2am. Bar was shut when we got back - surprised but secretly relieved.Bathroom was nice and shower was good and refreshing..... didnt bother with breakfast as it seemed quite expensive for what it was. There are lots of cafes and greasy spoons around the corner on the way to the British Museum so would recommend using those.All in all a good place to stop - great central location, relatively inexpensive and very quiet (which is always a plus). If we came down for a show would use as it is so close to covent garden and soho."
20,1234,"Jun 21 2009 	not stay again	the rooms are being redecorated, we did not get informed when we booked, also there are very small the showers do not work and our friends were moved rooms ,20 minuets walk to covent garden not round corner as thay say, not whorth the money,one posotive the night porter is great the guy can not do enough for you."
21,1234,"May 31 2009 	refurbished quality at good location	We stayed on the totally refurbished third floor, (the first and second were still more or less a construction site) in a superior room, very very nice. Breakfast buffet was very complete, the free newspapers appreciated. Location is perfect to explore London and a nice area in itself. They also have a very nice bar. I'd definitely go back! One small negative: no free internet."
22,1234,"Apr 22 2009 	yet one more disappointment?	we booked a cheaper B+B room deal here through a newspaper and although we expected to be allocated one of the rooms at the back we didn't really expect to be in a tiny, dingy and very tired room looking out into pipework at the back! The bed was hard and unforgiving and the green shower tray and loo was reminiscent of the 1970's. The door there didn't shut properly either. There was only enough tea and coffee for one cup each and one packet of small biscuits which fortunately had two biscuits to enjoy - one each!Fortunately we retain a very British sense of humour and as we had not come for a 'romantic' weekend we didn't face too much disappointment! Our plan was to walk through Bloomsbury to Covent Garden, Leicester Square and Soho..eat there and then go and see Jersey Boys (Excellent)! An easy stroll, great shops and very enjoyable. The hotel had a private function on and so the restaurant and bar were in the cellar that night. When we got back after the show we could see other guests were bothered by this as the Hotel had closed the bar down saying it was too quiet. Not the end of the world for us. Decent pubs within walking distance round corner.We felt some apprehension about breakfast but were pleasantly surprised by it being quite acceptable. Lots of tea and coffee and toast with the typical buffet breakfast.The staff fairly typical of London nowadays - few speak English and that makes it all so much more interesting."
23,1234,"Apr 6 2009 	Excellent location - refurbished rooms are great	Stayed here for one night in a twin room. The hotel is currently undergoing a 10million refurbishment and is due to finish in June 2009. We were lucky enough to get a refurbished room and it was excellent. The hotel say that they are 95% completed but the reception and hotel bar/restaurant are still to be refurbished and a few of the rooms I expect. The rooms look nothing like the photos on Trip Advisor (candid traveller photos). They have lovely bed linnen, comfy beds, flat screen TVs, safe, iron/board, large head shower, medium to large bathroom with window, air con, tea and coffee, room service and Sky TV. We got the impression that this was heading more towards a 4 star in the future than a 3 star as it's rated at the moment. The location is excellent! 10 minutes walk from theatreland at the most and we walked late at night and felt safe. It only took us about 20 - 30 minutes to walk to the London Eye so this is an excellent hotel for seeing most of the sights in London. It's only a very short walk from Holborn underground. We got a taxi to the Natural History Museum and it cost around 12 - 15. Receptionists were very helpful and friendly but bar staff were a little tbit miserable. Breakfast was good, not excellent, but you have a choice of full English and Continental. I would stay here again if I could get it at a good rate and would recommend this hotel to friends who were visiting for a short break. If you stay here make sure you ask for a refurbished room."
24,1234,"Jan 27 2009	Could and should do better!	Our staying at The Thistle Bloomsbury was as a consequence of The Thistle Trafalgar Square being over booked (a not uncommon occurrence according to other Thistle Hotel reviews). We were transferred by taxi that dropped us at the wrong hotel  not a great start. Very pleasant reception staff having to deal with a number of transferred guests that evening all suffering a sense of humour failure. The first room allocated was a twin. We had ordered a double and so we returned to reception and were allocated a room on what reception called the upgraded floor. It was very nice indeed and far better than the twin room which looked tired and in need of updating (I assume they are working their way through the building). Very quiet and about 15 minutes walk of the West End theatres. Sadly, breakfast at the Bloomsbury was a depressing affair. No one greeted us at the entrance and after some minutes we went and found someone. There were no clean tables despite only 5 or 6 of them being occupied (we arrived at 10.00am and service did not finish till 11.00am). The staff had clearly paid little attention to the hot buffet. Many items had run out and the offerings were pretty grim even by hot counter standards (where do they buy their sausages  inedible!). I would recommend you dodge the hot buffet completely if not for the fact that the ham on offer at the continental table was on the turn!....seriously, the food could not have been much worse. The dining room is dark, depressing and in dire need of redecoration. The sound of eighties pop classics being played through a flat screen TV at one end hardly improves the ambience. Had the cost of breakfast not been included in our stay I would have asked for a refund. Avoid it at all cost unless your rate is inclusive. In summary, a really lovely room in a hotel which is struggling to emerge from the late 1980s. No doubt the dining facilities will follow in due course (kicking and screaming all the way!)"
25,1234,"Jan 26 2009 	Stay here ... if you like the 1980s British sitcom vibe...	Oh crikey, where do I start with the Thistle at Bloomsbury (or Kingsley as it is being re-branded). The hotel is a building site at the moment scaffolding and all - something that the hotel didn't bother to mention to my travel agent. Anyway, by the time I arrived it was too late to change so best make the most of it.....The reception staff were pleasant enough, though kind of pretending that the hotel was functioning normally and not a builing site which was a bit odd...As soon as I opened the bedroom door I laughed out loud. The decor has got to be nearly 30 years old - patterned wallpaper, borders, wooden ceiling fan, old trouser press, padded headboards. In short, a cross between Sybil and Basil's bedroom and Hyacinth Bucket's house. The bathroom was a vision in ivory and avocado. Asthetics aside, the bed was hard, the room was freezing cold, the TV tiny and with limited channels and the wifi was the external BT Openzone (i.e. v expensive).I'm guessing that things can only get better when this place is done up but in the meantime guests should be a) forewarned that the standard is very low and no befitting of the Thistle and b) get a greatly reduced rate."
26,1234,"Dec 28 2008 	A hotel on the up	Having read the reviews about this hotel, I was naturally a little anxious about staying here for five nights on business, however, as it turned out, I needn't have been.Everyone [quite rightly] has different opinions of quality and service, what I want when I'm away from home on business is something that is clean, comfortable and in the right place. The Thistle met all of these requirements.I was in one of the newly refurbished rooms, which was very comfortable, although I agree with another reviewer that there should be more tea/coffee (and milk) in the rooms. I guess I could have asked for more... Cable TV would have been nice too, five days of only five channels was a bit hard to cope with.I was a little put off by the price of a pint in the hotel bar (3.60), however, there is a fantastic proper pub just around the corner called The Plough which restored my faith that the British Pub is still alive and well in London.Bearing in mind the cost of the pint was the worst thing I can recall about my stay, you can hopefully appreciate that this hotel is probably better than these reviews make out and with the refurbishment, this is definately a hotel on the up."
27,1234,"Dec 15 2008 	Love the new revamp	I had read good and bad reviews so really didn't know what to expect, i was just staying the one night as i was going to the theatre myself and my boyfriend, we found it really great location to all the west end. We checked in about 11 and they were really lovely at reception very helpful.The hotel is in the middle of a renovation but did not inconvenience us at all at all and we had one of the newly renovated room which was fabulous,everything you could want. What ever you you could imagin for breakfast it was there i really enjoyed our stay only sorry it wasn't longer."
28,1234,Oct 14 2008 	Fantastic Location	We booked this hotel for one night as we were in London to see a band. We got an excellent rate on Expedia including breakfast.The room was large by London standards and was clean. It had a plentiful supply of Toiletries and tea/coffee. It had a large comfortable bed and a large bathroom. Breakfast was nice and check in was simple and the staff were very helpful. This hotel is within walking distance of Covent Garden.We would definitely go back.
29,1234,"Oct 13 2008 	Horrible!!	I stayed at this hotel last week for 2 nights and it was probably one of the worst hotels I've stayed in. At 198 a night I expected more than the dirty, out of date bedrooms, rip off room service and disgusting breakfasts. As well as the windows not opening in my bedroom, the heating being on full blast, the hair dryer not working and almost being scaled every time I turned a tap on in the bathroom. Awful. Do not stay here, there are far more nicer hotels in the area for the same price if not cheaper."
30,1234,"Sep 22 2008 	Great location terrible rooms and customer service	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, booked through work, for a meeting. I was not put off by the refurbishment at all and thought the hotel was nice inside the lobby etc, very old fashioned feel but clean. My room was booked as a single and so i expected to get a small room which was not a problem, the room was very dark with only one very small dirty window and there were only 2 very poor lights which meant the room was pretty dark most of the time. However, i didnt find this too much of a problem either.Come the first morning i attempted to take a shower only to find there was no hot water in the room, even after running for 15 minutes it only got to lukewarm! I telephoned reception and explained that i had no hot water - the reply i was given was to 'run it for a bit'. I explained i had been running it and asked to move rooms- i was told no problem and to go to reception. When i arrived at reception i was told there was no alternative room available. I asked what i was supposed to do with no hot water and was told there was nothing they could do and try again later! I was amazed by this response in all honesty!To cut a long story short, i managed to get moved later that evening but the room i was moved to was falling to pieces to say the least and very dirty - but i did get hot water!The main problem for me here was the attitude to having no hot water that i received - i think when you are paying near 200 per night hot water shouldnt be an optional extra!"
31,1234,"Sep 3 2008 	Major Refurb in Progress but...	I stayed here for one night on a business trip. I was aware that it was being refurbished when I booked but the location was ideal for my purposes.The hotel is currently shrouded in scaffolding so I was glad I took a cab from the train station or I think I'd have missed it!The reception area is spacious and the reception staff were very friendly they also upgraded my room from a single to a family room so I would have more space - a very nice touch I thought.The room itself was very tired but it was clean and tidy, the bed was pretty comfortable, as were the pillows (yes more than 1!). Everything was where it should be and nothing was dirty or used.I ended up having dinner in the hotel it was very tasty but expensive for what it was and there are plenty of places near by to choose from.I can't say the room was overly quiet but considering its in the centre of London and on a reasonably busy road it wasn't too bad - I slept pretty well.Breakfast wasn't that good, I was a little disappointed, the coffee lacked guts and the buffet was poorly laid out, nothing was labelled. I didn't venture for a cooked breakfast but they looked stingy.Having said all that, I would probably use it again once the refurbishment is complete, its a great location and all the staff I came accross (other than the 2 concierge) were really lovely.If you accept the fact that it is being refurbished, and don't pay over 100 for a night, its a pretty good hotel by London stanadrds to my mind!"
32,1234,"Jul 17 2008	Good value for money	My wife &amp; I stayed at the hotel and rate it very highly. It is very convenient for central London, tubes &amp; buses. We walked around the corner and got a full english breakfast for GBP4.50 compared to the hotel price of GBP 14 so be wise in that area. The staff are friendly and helpful and coming from South Africa the concierge gave us good advice on tourist sites and bus services. Definitely recommend as good value for money"
33,1234,"Jul 4 2008 	Woefull	2 nights in this hotel recently.I'll cut to the chase.Problems1. The whole hotel is encapsulated in scafolding and plastic therefore the views are lets say &quot;restricted&quot; (Do they inform customers of this fact before they book??)2. No Aircon. 1 very noisy clicking fan overhead. So nighttime choices are a) Can I sleep with this noise if I leave it on or b) Can I sleep with the heat and humidity if I turn it off3. Flush the toilet - cistern lid pops up (nice touch)4. Cold water tap. Leave this running for 5 minutes to let the boiling water run off. It eventually reduces in temperature to merely hot. (and no the taps weren't plumbed up wrongly)5. Breakfast - colleague order sausages, eggs and bacon. After a 30 minute wait he got 1 small sausage, 1 very small rubbery egg and the smallest rasher of bacon I have ever seen served. (15 thank you very much)Just not good enough I'm afraid.Avoid!"
34,1234,Jun 12 2008 	good location but shabby	Stayed overnight with a colleague prior to a work meeting. The price for a twin room on the website of a well known supplier of last minute bookings was 180. I contacted the hotel and got it for 128. The room was clean but shabby. There was lots of peeling paint. The tiles in the bathroom and the lavatory itself were cracked. The lavatory also did not flush properly. on arrival in the room there was an overpowering smell of fruit scented cleaning product. It took several hours with teh window open for this to disperse. I asked for a room change and offered to pay extra for an upgrade but was told that the hotel was full.The beds were very comfortable and the bed lineen seemed new and very clean. the breakfast room was cool and airy and we thought the breafast was fine.I would have been very annoyed ahd I paid 180 for the room as I don't believe it is worth that. The location was very convenient . If I had to stay there again I would try and get a superior room.
35,1234,"Jun 7 2008 	Fawlty Towers	If you're in London, don't go out of your way to find this place.I asked for a quiet room and was given 516 which was above a pub. Needless to say, it was a tad noisy to say the least The room looked as if it had been decorated by a child with patches of wallpaper dotted about the walls. The bathroom was dirty and didn't look as if it had been decorated since the hotel was built.Breakfast was the highlight with all tables laid out but no food to eat. When it came, it was basic and the staff offhand.I wont be going back"
36,1234,"May 16 2008 	Avoid at all costs - my first ever one star review	This hotel has the potential to be a wonderful establishment, but is sadly seriously lacking instead. My wife and I stayed for a theatre and food break for four nights this week and were disappointed on pretty much every level. The contrast between this hotel another Thistle we stayed at a couple of months ago couldn't be more marked.First of all, the positive part - the location is good - very near Tottenham Court Road/Oxford Street and handy for a couple of tube stations - If you want to spend significant time in the British museum, it is singularly close. Housekeeping staff were great - room was kept clean and they were very quick to exchange our pillows for thinner ones (we're used to thin pillows, so our necks suffer when we encounter very thick ones.)Now the difficulties. I'd like to emphasise that I accept that problems do occur as an everyday part of life, but how issues are dealt with affects my opinion of the overall customer experience. Feel free to check my other reviews - be assured, I am not a serial moaner.Reception and check in - Check in seemed needlessly prolonged and there seemed to be IT issues distracting the staff. When calling reception in relation to other issues I had the phone answered and then put down on me at least three times when I called from the room. This is not in keeping with a supposed blue chip experience.Room service was poor. Great difficulty placing the order, which then took 20 minutes longer than advised. When we uncovered the dishes, we discovered one of them was wrong and were told it would be replaced in 5 minutes. Not the case, this took another 25 minutes. We didn't repeat the experience. You may want to avoid the dining area on the basis of the very large damp area on the ceiling, perhaps caused by an overflowing bath? But certainly an eyesore you wouldn't expect in a reasonable hotel.On the subject of food, breakfast was well below average, especially given the price. Tables were badly laid out, meaning people were bumping into you through no fault of their own. Service was slow and confused, plus the food was far from great, we stopped bothering after 2 days and just ate out instead.The first serious problem we encountered was when my wife had the fold out ironing board collapse while she was ironing the first day we were there - the locking mechanism didn't work and the falling iron burnt her arm, thankfully not seriously. When she went to reception to report the defect and the burn on her arm (the phone at reception wasn't answered when we called) she was offered some ice to put on it, but the board wasn't fixed during our stay and no accident report was filled in.On a health and safety front, there were several areas of carpet in the corridors on our floor which had frayed and were trip hazards, worse still, the main stair carpet on the first two landing suffered the same problem. Nothing done in the time we were there to fix it - not even some electrical tape to cover the frayed areas.When the lights blew in the bathroom, we reported this and the bulbs were replaced while we were out. When replacing them, &quot;candle effect&quot; tungsten bulbs were used instead of spots, meaning they protruded from the mounts and the one above the bath/shower wasn't sealed, leaving a gap for steam to get into the ceiling space. When replacing the latter, the cover was broken and not replaced and my wife found shards of the old plastic cover for the remainder of our stay (using her feet - ouch.) It came as little surprise when the lights fused the following day, tripping out our corridor. The maintenance chap that responded was disgusted with the replacement his colleague had carried out and apologised, replacing the bulbs with the appropriate type later that day.The TV wasn't receiving several channels and the &quot;interactive&quot; functions such as view bill, set alarm call, teletext etc didn't work properly the whole time we were there. What's worse is that we were promised a fix every day, and it never came in 5 days. I suspect there is an endemic issue they simply can't address.You might regard these as minor problems if you're just going room only and spending most of your time out and about and just sleeping at the hotel. This brings me to another serious flaw. Most hotels these days have upvc double glazing rather than conventional sash windows. Not so here. I've lived with sash windows for c.35 years and know they needn't cause draughts or noise if they're well fitted and adjusted. Suffice to say that in order to get any sleep, we had to tear up a newspaper and spend 20 minutes stuffing paper into the gaps to stop them rattling. I can't imagine how bad the noise is if you're on the front (traffic exposed) side of the hotel to boot - we heard other residents complaining about the noise.A series of other little issues contributed to the bad experience. Hand driers not working in the lowest floor toilets, erratic wifi, main entrance door jamming, no-one staffing the bar at 5:30 pm, etc etc. The staff seem to be friendly, but poorly trained and managed, with a substandard infrastructure to maintain. Just too many minor little things an top of the other issues, especially given the price. This is the thing - you can expect rattles, quirks and foibles from an economy hotel, but this is far from a discount establishment. In all the reviews I have put up on tripadvisor, this is the first time I have felt the need to put in a one star review - the combination of the various issues and the price means I have to warn other tripadvisor users not to stay here.I find it ironic that the Thistle Trafalgar Square that we stayed at a couple of months ago is so much better for the same chain and price. In summary, unless you sleep very deeply and are going to the British Museum every day (which is a wonderful place incidentally) do yourself a favour and just don't stay here."
37,1234,"May 5 2008 	great hotel	We stayed at the hotel as my partner and I were both out in London and didn't want to rush for the late train.The hotel was great and we would definately stay there again. We had previously stayed at a Thistle not so far away which was very average. This Thistle was very different and I could easily have stayed there for more than one night.The room was spacious, clean, plenty of towels and toiletries. The only complaint was that the bar closed early about 1am. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment.A great central pace to stay and I am very fussy about where I stay.Don't book via the hotel website look around for prices."
38,1234,"Apr 1 2008	Really nice very friendly and helpful staff	After booking I read the reviews here on tripadvisor and got really worried. But we soon found out that there hadnt been any need for worries. So if you too are worried about having booked this hotel, dont be. I wonder if those very dissappointed people actually stayed at the same hotel...This is an good four star hotel in a fantastic location, close to shopping, theatres, restaurants and just about next door to The British Museum.There were five of us (three teenagers) staying in three different rooms and everyone was happy and satisfied. The rooms were spacious with really comfortable beds.The decor and furnishing may not be at your liking and a few things are a bit dated, but we found it rather charming and above all; everything was really clean, everything worked (loved the towel heaters) and the service was excellent. Breakfast was fresh with lots of things to choose from.We would definitly stay here again."
39,1234,"Mar 13 2008 	great location	Booked hotel as part of a package including rail travel so didn't need to park a car. Would recommend the hotel based on location for theatres, shopping, museums and restaurants and probably short stays. The staff were very friendly and helpful, though I would suggest the hotel rating is a little dated along with the decor. The room was clean and tidy and deceptively spacious as it had a walk in wardrobe."
40,1234,"Mar 4 2008 	Disappointed!!!!	We made the decision to stay at this hotel as it was convenient for the British Museum. We found the reception to be okay and the building very charming. Our room however was 'tired', someone had kicked in the bathroom door at some time and the door had been very poorly repaired. The heated towel rail was repaired with red masking tape leaving bare wires in the bathroom. The cleaners appear to use very poor quality vacuum cleaners as the room made my wife's eyes and chest irritated. The bed was comfortable and the room well appointed if somewhat shoddy. At one point a cleaner let herself into the room without knocking which could have been embarrasing!At breakfast we entered the dinning area and were shown to an uncleared table. Crockery and cutlery were taken from another uncleared table to set ours. No one took our order, I had to search out a member of staff who found english very difficult. Eventually our full english breakfast arrived and to say it was disgusting was to put it mildly. Disgarding this onto another table we approached the buffet which was completely devoid of food. So our breakfast consisted of toast and jam. The staff saw that we disgarded our breakfast but made no attempt to approach us in any way. We did not make any represention at the hotel due to the attitude of the staff and wanting to leave this place sooner rather than later. I can assure you that Thistle Hotel will not be first choice next time I visit London."
41,1234,"Feb 29 2008 	Don't use this hotels recommended car park!	This hotel directs customers to the NCP on Museum Street if driving. DO NOT PARK HERE! Drug users live in the stairwell and there is no CCTV or staff at this location.We had our car broken into overnight and the hotel management couldn't care less. Basically this spoilt the weekend. Having spoken with the Metropolitan Police, they recommend Camden council run car parks. The nearest one is Bloomsbury square and is clean, secure and crime free. Also it's cheaper and only a 2 minute walk to the hotel.A costly weekend, dirty rooms and a car repair bill of 750, all because we followed the hotels notes on the website.Good location, but that's it.They are a poor advert for the Thistle group......Avoid."
42,1234,"Feb 25 2008 	Adequate Hotel inGreat Location	The Thistle Bloomsbury is a pretty average hotel in a great location...close to shops, Theatres, Bars and Restaraunts.We booked as thee seperate parties and arriving early, two rooms were available and one was not. We dropped of opur luggage (sixth floor, mouldy stain on wall) and went out for the afternoon.When we came back, the third room in our party was allocated the Kingsley Suite....well, Interesting is the word to describe it...a combintaion between a seventies cop's pad and a chinese brothel!! Very, very interesting!!Nice staff..good breakfast...just a little old and tired is th real problem with this hotel...time for a refurb!!"
43,1234,"Jan 24 2008 	Nice Break	We stayed at the Thistle as part of a Theatre package. The accommodation was average, our room had poor secondary glazing and the original windows rattled in the wind. The staff were fine, location was great for theatres etc.I would use it again."
44,1234,"Jan 22 2008 	British charm	We stayed for the second time at this hotel in January 2008 and it was even nicer than two years ago. The staff was very friendly and made it possible for us to check in early. It is true that the windows are a little old and single glazed, but the room was very well equipped and the furniture was fine (new beds!).The lobby, staircase and hallways have a delightful British charm and are so much different from the postmodern hotels you see all over the world.Above all, the location is ideal. You can walk to Soho, Covent Garden and Oxford Street, and of course have a stroll around Bloomsbury."
45,1234,"Jan 19 2008	good choice	This a hotel of some character and the location is great; safe and within a stroll of theatres and British Museum. Room was great, staff freindly and breakfast cooked to order (not a semi cold buffet)Downside?Single glazing means road noise is an issue .. windows need upgradingBar is souless and even for London prices are steep with a poor choice.. go round corner to Museum Tavern a lovely old pub with 4 real ales and decent wine by glass"
46,1234,"Jan 1 2008 	Bad experience	Terrible experience during our holiday arrival at the reception.Arriving with two children after a long journey we did not feel welcomed at all. Rude and unpolite reception desk personel.Although rooms were available reception personel refused to give us the rooms according our booking. We were placed in the smallest room with the wrong beds. Both children became sick because the heater did not work and the window in bedroom and bathroom coild not be closed for three days. Our London trip during Christmas holiday was spoiled because of this bad experience. NEVER AGAIN. Prof.Dr.H.Baker, The Netherlands"
47,1234,"Dec 29 2007	Great Location -Close to Theatres	The rooms were okay, and overall our stay was fine, but the experience could have been better. When we arrived we had two twins instead of the double we requested, and they were unable to change our room that night. However, our two twins ended up being quite comfortable. There was a nice tea service setup in the room, but when we drank our allotted supply of tea on the first day it was never replenished. In fact, on at least one day they didn't even take our teacups to clean or replace them with fresh ones. The best thing about this hotel is the location. VERY close to tube stops, the British Museum, and the Theatres. We walked to see Spamalot on the first night, and to the wonderful Ivy restaurant the second night. While we only used the tube, we did notice that we were quite close to bus stops as well. Not bad for the price and location!"
48,1234,"Nov 14 2007 	Great location great staff	We recently stayed here for one night with a young baby and the staff could not have been more helpful.The hotel is really close to all of London's West End, meaning you can walk home and you don't need to use public transport.Reception and eating areas are clean and fucntional and the check -in and concierge staff were great.I used room service for dinner - it was prompt and friendly and reasonably priced.Only mild downside, rooms not huge (although I 'm not sure you can do too much about this in an old building like this) and need freshening but apparently this is due shortly.Also, main entrance is up a set of steep stairs.Not the cheapest by any means but you will really appercaite the locationWould come again"
49,1234,"Sep 28 2007 	Not bad at all	After the many poor reviews given to this hotel, Thistle Bloomsbury was really my last resort as London Hotels were totally packed during the period I was there, and I had to stay for 8 nights. Hence, my wife and I opened the hotel room door with much anticipation and dread --- but immediately heaved a huge sigh of relief. Room layout - We were left with a twin room (312). It was spacious and clean with ample wardrobe space. The design was &quot;English&quot; with curtains, wallpapers and a nice couch. The aircon was noisy so we did not switch it on much. We used the ceiling fan instead.Bed - Bad. The twins were small (even for us Asians) and you can actually feel the springs in the mattress i.e. not comfy.Toilet - Clean, well spaced out with shower gel, shampoo and nice clean towels (no toothbrushes, toothpaste and shaver). The bathtub had a plastic screen by the side to prevent water from splashing out and wet the toilet floors. There's a electric heated towel rack to dry your towels quickly. Others - We had kettle, iron and iron board, coffee / tea, safe inside the room.Meals - B'fast was standard English breakfast of eggs, mushrooms, toasts, ham, bacon, baked beans, cereals, pastries served with tea/ coffee. But it's the same everyday.Service - The front-desk was cordial but not exceptionally helpful. I tried for many days to change to a double, but they did not go their way out to go the extra mile for a customers staying for 8 nights! The restaurant staff are ok.Location - Not a lot of convenience stores around. The nearest tube is Holbon (3 mins walk) and Tottemham Court (6 mins walk). There's a bus-stop directly outside the hotel which is well served by buses coming in from central tourist areas. It's a 10 mins nice stroll to the theatre districts, and there's lots of restaurants and pubs serving cheap and good food for threatre goers (about 7-8 GBP for a 2 course). Lot's of bookshops along Tottenham Court - Charing Cross just less than 10 mins away. British Museum is directly behind the hotel. Oxford street (shopping) is also within walking distance. My verdict - I got corporate rate for the hotel, so it's worth it. Otherwise, it could be a tad expensive. Based on the feedback on this website, I also think that the quality of the rooms varies and it just happened that mine's pretty good. If it helps, its ROOM 312."
50,1234,"Sep 18 2007	Basic hotel in a good location	The hotel is situated within a good 20 minute walking distance from Euston station, and is conveniently located between Holborn and Tottenham Court Road Tube station. We were upgraded to a deluxe room for free of charge. The room was clean and tidy, but a little small. I dread to think what size a normal room was. The bathroom was also a little small, the bath could be a little bigger and the toilet was located so closed to the bathroom door. We only had breakfast in the hotel. The service was a little patchy, more staff required a think. Overall, I give the hotel 6 out of 10. Good location, clean and tidy. Service from staff is a little patchy and needs improving."
51,1234,"Jul 12 2007 	Not nice room	The public spaces in this hotel are very clean and generally well presented. However, my room on the 4th floor had clearly seen better days. It suffered from cracked tiles, flaking paint, curling up carpet, torn curtains, no lamp shades, and worst of all I thought grotty stained headboards on the beds.Additionally, when I checked in the reservation price I had been quoted (in writing) didn't include VAT.I didn't use the restaurant for dinner or breakfast - too put off by the room - there are plenty of restaurants of all varieties and prices nearby."
52,1234,"Jul 3 2007 	Absolutely dreadful	Only stayed at this place for one night, and believe me, that was one night too many. Duck tape covering holes in the bedroom carpet, broken tiles in the bathroom, an ironing board that wouldn't stay up, musty smells in the wardrobe, and a beautiful view of a rusty old emergency stairwell and scaffolding.The only saving grace was a very nice breakfast in the morning. However, this wasn't enough to compensate for poor facilities and an overall feeling that the place is lacking investment."
53,1234,Jun 30 2007 	Staff at both ends of the spectrum could not get internet to work	My company booked this hotel for me as London was fully booked for Wimbledon.Checkin was very ordinary.Room was tucked away and in a corner which I really liked. Number one problem was I couldn't get my internet to work. They have a BT hotspot system but I couldn't get a signal anywhere. The reception told me no one else was having a problem. I use my WiFi all the time and I never have problems but I don't know if the problem was theirs or mine.Some of the staff I found just rude and then others were really friendly and helpful - on balance they were more good than bad. The bed I had was very old and lumpy - worst bed I've had in a while.Checkout is normally at 12:00 and as my flight was at 7.00pm I tried to get a late checkout for 3.00pm - the front desk was having none of it telling me I had to checkout at 12:00 - in the end I asked to speak to the manager and he said &quot;no problem with a 3.00pm checkout but we charge GBP20/hour&quot; - I don't mind paying the GBP20/hour so problem solved.Breakfast in the morning is pretty chaotic. Room service did not want to deliver breakfast as they advised me they were very busy.Average london hotel but they charged GBP188 without breakfast which was GBP15. Very expensive for what you get but thats London. I would use this hotel as a last resort but there are better hotels in London for the price
54,1234,"Jun 14 2007 	Excellent London base	We spent an excellent girls weekend at the Thistle Bloomsbury. We had spent the same weekend here last year and this year was even better. We booked through --- (same as last year) which allowed us to reserve our rooms in advance at half the standard rate but not pay until the departure date, we were also able to cancel or change our rooms until 24 hours before our arrival, excellent!We had 4 twins and 1 single all on the same corridor, excellent condition, clean, spacious, light, these were much nicer than our rooms the previous year. I suspect that this floor (4th) may have been more recently refurbished than those we previously stayed in (2&amp;3). The breakfast buffet was good, nice fry up but limited choice of continental breakfast for those wanting cheese, ham and fruit. This hotel is an excellent base for tourists or anyone wanting to enjoy the entertainment in london. Bloomsbury is a nice area and is about 5 minutes walk from Covent Garden and a few minutes more to Leicester Square. Shaftsbury Theatre is even closer. Holburn tube is a few minutes walk so easy to get around London full stop.The staff are very friendly and helpful although only 1 of the 6 reception staff we encountered was english and although the other staffs english was good, we did loose a few things in translation. We had the same problem the previous year, if your booking, payment etc is straightforward you'll be fine and we got there in the end.I would definantly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a good base in London. I wouldn't pay full price but london is expensive so this is an excellent hotel for the price I paid."
55,1234,"May 13 2007 	Convenient 	Our room was fine, with sufficient space, windows that opened(!) &amp; nice set-up for making tea. Bathroom was tight, with a &quot;moody&quot; toilet. The hotel was very convenient: walking distance from the tube, with plenty of transportation &amp; restaurant choices. This was our first &quot;full English&quot; breakfast and it was terrific. The only hitch was getting coffee &amp; tea orders placed. The staff was helpful and friendly. This hotel made a good base for touring the city."
56,1234,"Apr 25 2007 	A good visit for a family	We stayed here the weekend of 13th April, we were a little concerned after reading some reviews, but the whole weekend went really well. Staff were polite at all times, the best we have experienced in 4 star and 5 star hotels. The decor is traditional, but tidy. Our room was clean, everything worked!!! The bed was comfortable. We have two small children and they had decent single beds, feeling safe in the room and hotel. Although at the front, in a turreted room, on the first floor, the road noise was fine, we all slept well. Fresh milk was easily available and staff were so helpful!!The breakfast was extensive, fresh and well presented. One moan- the coffee was instant - not ground- a tiny isue corrected by Pret a manger! Definately stay here again and would recommend it for anyone with a family or going to a show!! Thank you Thistle Bloomsbury- super experience."
57,1234,"Mar 31 2007 	Awful Hotel - Do Not Stay Here	The hotel gave us a disgusting, filthy room. The tiles in the bathroom were broken and the bed was literally hard as a rock. This is NOT a four star hotel - it is more like a one star hotel.Furthermore, the staff is incredibly rude and refused to help when we complained about the room. Save yourself money and a headache - do not stay at this hotel."
58,1234,"Feb 24 2007 	Good size room for London	The hotel is very convenient. It has easy access to transport and feels safe at night. My room was a good size for a London hotel. The TV was up on the wall right at the end of the bed, which mad for uncomfortable viewing. The public areas of the hotel are clean and well presented."
59,1234,"Jan 26 2007 	Great location average hotel	This hotel is in an excellent location for the British Museum and other major London sites, its also very convenient for public transport. The entrance lobby and bar areas are very nicely decorated. However, the rooms (the one I stayed in at least) are pretty dated and don't get much light, although they are clean and quite spacious. The breakfast was good but somewhat overpriced."
60,1234,"Jan 10 2007	Very Good Underrated Overbashed Hotel!	I was a member of a school band trip to London for the New Year's parade and enjoyed the stay very much. What I first noticed was the hotel's great location near many attractions. Second, the front desk staff was very accommodating when dealing with issues regarding rooms or room assignments. The rooms were ready for all of us 5 1/2 hours before what is the regular check-in time! The room I stayed in had a very well kept and clean bathroom as well as an odd-sounding but perfectly working air-conditioner that got my roommate and I's room warmer or cooler whenever we needed it to do so. The elevator's worked well and appeared to be newly renovated or at least very new. The only negatives to the stay was the inability to get a wake up call at the time asked for and the rooms all smelled slightly smoky, but so do many other establishments in central London. Overall, the band and I's six night experience in the Thistle Bloomsbury was very positive and I would not hesitate to stay here again on a future visit!"
61,1234,"Jan 8 2007 	Fairly nice hotel good for first time in London	I stayed at this hotel this past August 2006 during my first time in London. Starting with the location, its great since its walking distance to alot of attractions and tube stations. Places like British Museum, Oxford Street, Soho, Covent Garden, theatre district and several restaurants and shops. Must be mentioned the 'easy cafe' which is good price for internet access on Tottenham Court Road. Also near tube stations like Holborn and Tottenham Court Road.Rooms are basic and European style. I was travelling with my sister at the time, there were 2 twin beds and good size for 2 people. Bathrooms were okay but seemed they needed refinishing, like tiles and lighting. Most importantly were spotless and clean. But one thing though, the toilet needed alot of energy to flush. Maybe since the toilets in England don't waste as much water, as I'm used to in North America. So I guess that was a good thing.One thing I enjoyed was the included buffet breakfast at the hotel. Food was good when you arrive early, at around 7:00-8:00 am. But usually the standard breakfast fare, sausages, eggs, beans, tomatoes etc. It can be tiring but well worth it for a long day of touring as you don't have to eat for a while.The only issue I had with the hotel, was that the second day our door wouldn't lock. The hotel staff were glad to change us to another room and even deducted phone charges because of the inconvenience. But with the room we were moved too, location was terrible. Since it was the 1st floor and facing the street. Looking out the window you can see people on the double decker buses closely and was extremely noisy during the evenings due to the nearby pub.Overall, a good stay at the Thistle Bloomsbury especially since it was my first time in London. I definitly recommend it for first timers travelling there."
62,1234,"Jan 5 2007 	Tiny overpriced room	I stayed overnight here as I was on a two-day training couse. The location was very convenient, and on first impressions, the hotel looked impressive, with a nice reception area and lounge. Check-in was a breeze, but when I eventually located my single room down a rabbit warren of a corridor, I was shocked at how much they were charging given the size of the room. There was barely room to turn around, and when the room service I ordered arrived, it was awkward for the waiter to get past me into the room so he could set the tray down.My food was ok, but the burger I ordered was slightly underdone in the middle, and the whole thing smelt a bit of stale fat (seems to be a theme in Thistle hotels - see my review of the Thistle Barbican!). The cheesecake made up for it though...Once the food was out of the way, I settled down on a comfy bed and read complimentary newspapers and watched TV. The room was comfortable and nicely furnished, if a bit chintzy. However, I was woken up several times in the night, partly by strange noises from water pipes, and partly by rowdy people in the street behind the hotel (admittedly not the hotel's fault!).I didn't have breakfast at the hotel the next morning, so can't comment on that. Overall, not a bad stay, but expensive for what you get. Much better than the Thistle Barbican though!"
63,1234,"Jan 4 2007 	the horror of it all	I have worked 17 countries as an attorney, and Thistle Bloomsbury was a truly unique experience.Booked through a hotel agency in a train station, was put into a room where... i kid you not... the ceiling was falling down. It was water stained and pieces of it fell into the corner of the room where the chair was. When questioned, the manager advised me that &quot;there are many rooms in the hotel and management doesn't have a chance to check them all&quot;. Translating this into American, this would mean that in the couple of weeks it takes for water damaged ceilings to dry and start falling in, no one in management saw the hotel room. Sad really.This was the SECOND try, the first try was being sent to a room in the actual basement, no elevator, nothing, just a steep flight of stairs into the basement with a suitcase. Makes you want to weep.Dirty scuffed walls, peeling wallpaper covering, some kind of permanent stain on the rug. Some sense of despair at being trapped there. After advising the front desk of the falling plaster, I DID get (at my suggestion) upgraded to a better room. Not saying this lightly, but the worst hotel I have encountered anywhere in the European Union.If you MUST try the Thistle experience, the one near the train station (Charing Cross?, don't remember) was far less depressing.Paul. telcohr@mail.ru"
64,1234,"Dec 21 2006 	Loved this hotel	Stayed at this hotel last weekend and loved it. Great location, the staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was fine - Room 527. The porter, in particular, was absolutely brilliant - great sense of humour - and believe me this is hard - I've worked on Reception in a hotel - and very, very helpful. The bar staff also were great and a good laugh. We ate in the hotel restaurant the first night and the meal was one of the best I've had in a hotel - great price and the wine was fab too. Will definitely be back."
65,1234,"Dec 8 2006 	I didn't think it was that bad...	I got a great deal to stay here for 2 nights via Priceline. Admittedly, I did not spend much time in the hotel or my room. The staff were accomodating and let me check in a little bit early. My room was adequate in size. I spent most of my day out exploring and only really returned home to sleep/shower/change, so it suited my purposes fine. The location was great as it was not too far from the Underground. For the price, I thought it was great value."
66,1234,"Nov 29 2006 	My Low Expectations were Confirmed	This is the first hotel I ever booked on Priceline, and I feel I was duped. When Priceline confirmed the reservation with the hotel name my heart sank. (I had read previous reviews about this hotel.) There was nothing I could do about the reservation, but hope for the best.Before leaving the U.S., I sent e-mails and followed up with faxes to the hotel front desk staff with legitimate questions, and no one ever responded. I couldn't get a re-confirmation for our room reservation prior to departure.The Thistle Bloomsbury Hotel is located on Bloomsbury Way, and there is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel. Bus #38 runs from Victoria Station to the hotel for GBP1.50.The room assigned to us was on the fourth floor with no view, just the scaffolding on a neighboring church. It was clean with two twin beds having lumpy mattresses. The white down comforters and sheets were spotless and soft with mushy bed pillows and no extra pillows in the armoire.I felt like it was 1945: There are two original separate hot and cold faucets in the bathroom sink. You have to swing your cupped hands back-and-forth to mix the hot and cold water! Aggravating to say the least. We had brought an electrical converter and adapter, but my husband's electric shaver wouldn't work in the one and only wall socket. A maintenance man tried to get the shaver to work, but to no avail. (He was in our room because the in-room safe was broken and he replaced it with one in working order.) The water pressure was excellent in the shower, and there is a &quot;tepid &quot;chrome water heater unit where towels are placed. Breakfast was not included in the our room rate of $148.The room was quiet at night, and we did not hear any other hotel guests. Each floor has a &quot;lobby&quot; where the staircase and elevators (2) are located. Off the lobby, you pass through a door with 1/2 glass (so you can see oncoming traffic), which again leads you to more 1/2 glass interior doors depending upon your room number. These doors may be a factor in keeping the noise level down.This hotel is located next to a church, which was undergoing an exterior cleaning (power washing), and went on all day until about 5:00 p.m. (We would stop back at the hotel during the day so we assumed the power washing noise may have been constant.)The decor is long past its prime - I believe it is Victorian. This may have been a grand hotel at one point in time. However, its location was excellent for visiting the British Museum, which is around the corner.The Holborn Tube Station is the closest station to this hotel, and it is about a 5-7 minute brisk walk - not that convenient.This may have been a grand hotel in the past, but they should drop the moniker of a 4-star hotel. The very best part of our stay at the hotel was the concierge, Salvatore. He is a class act, and he did, in fact, compensate for the hotel's shortcomings. Unfortunately, he's retiring in December, 2006.We do not recommend this hotel."
67,1234,"Nov 20 2006 	Far from the 4-star experience advertised	I'd heard great things about the Thistle chain from friends, so was looking forward to staying in a glamorous 4-star rated hotel while I was in town to see a show. Just as the review said, the location was pretty good for the theatre, it was only a fifteen minute walk so saved us having to get a cab after the show. Unfortunately, the stay itself left something to be desired. First, while I was checking in they put me in a single room even though I specified a double, and when I went down to change rooms the clerk acted like it was a big inconvenience. Once we got into the correct room it was certainly a long way from four stars. It was a decent size and relatively clean and tidy, except for the toilet seat in the bathroom was broken off. There was no view, no cable, no frills. All in all it was motel-standard, which ordinarily I wouldn't complain about, but was well disappointed because it was billed as luxury. The hotel either needs to drop the attitude and lower prices, or have a serious overhaul to justify the rating."
68,1234,"Oct 9 2006 	Do Not Stay Here - Would not recommend to Anyone	We picked the hotel out of the QANTAS Holiday book. Talk about FALSE ADVERTISING. The room looked NOTHING like the brochure. It was supposed to be ranked 3 stars - more like one. The musty smell started when you left the small lift. The smell of room 304 was disgusting. The room was small , dark, smelt musty and mouldy. All the fittings were shabby from the bedspread to the carpet. The bathroom was tiny and not well lit (to hide the mismatched tiles).  The hotel room was next to a bar which played loud music until 2-2.30am. The cleaners came in at 6am and cranked up the music. So you won't get any sleepThe windows wouldnt close so the noise of the music (and the drunks at closing time) came through - it was like sleeping in the street.When I went to complain, the lift doors opened and there were empty pint glasses in the lift - leftovers from the bar I suppose. We were booked for 7 nights and only stayed ONE. We checked out and found another hotel across the road (ironically ranked 2 stars) and it was much better.The staff were unhelpful and suggested we should have complained to the bar directly!!! and didnt offer any alternate rooms. I couldn't wait till breakfast to check out!!!!!!!!!!!. Certainly tainted my first visit to London. Luckily it got better once we checked out!!I wouldn't let my mother - in - law stay there."
69,1234,"Sep 28 2006 	Decent Hotel for a Decent Price	We booked this room via a priceline bid. Stayed for 5 nights. Basically, you get what you pay for. When we checked in, we asked where the internet terminal was located and were told there wasn't one. I later found this on my own. After a 2a.m. check-in, we received wake up calls at 6:30a.m. and 6:35 a.m. Neither were requested. The rooms are clean, but did smell similar to urine at times. Definitely ask for a &quot;quiet room.&quot; We wish we had. The street outside is incredibly noisy; heavy traffic and people were singing and shouting throughout night. Day concierge was incredibly helpful and professional. Evening concierge was the exact opposite. You're better off finding things on your own than asking the evening conciergeMany restaurants nearby close early, but we found 2 that were open later that are worth mentioning. We had an excellent Greek dinner at Konaki and equally enjoyed an Indian dinner at the Chambeli. Highly recommend both. Overall, I would recommend this hotel if you aren't looking for any frills. Definitely not a 4 star hotel (compared to US standards), but one of the better deals in London. Rooms are clean and most staff are very polite and helpful. Felt safe in hotel and surrounding area."
70,1234,"Sep 12 2006 	Well they offered us cosy rooms....	Ive often read reviews on Trip Advisor and thought dont be so fussy or worse things happen. I now realise how lucky I have been, the truth is Ive done a lot of travelling and had very few things to complain about.then came my stay at the Thistle Bloomsbury.The customer care at the Thistle Bloomsbury is dreadful. I was particularly disappointed as I booked the stay in London for my birthday; my husband and father had a dinner to go to and my mother and I had booked theatre tickets.We arrived at the hotel at 3pm and were greeted (reluctantly) by a gentleman on reception. He advised me that our rooms were not yet ready so could we please wait. After waiting fifteen minutes with no offer of refreshments, I once again queued at reception. This time I spoke to a young woman behind the desk. I explained that as we had not yet eaten lunch and it was now nearly 3.30pm we would like to check in, leave our luggage at reception and go out for the afternoon. I duly went through the check-in procedure, had our bags tagged and left for the afternoon.We all arrived back at 6pm when I was again greeted by the same gentlemen on reception, he mumbled that I needed to speak to somebody else and asked me to wait. Another fifteen minutes passed and there was still no sign of anybody. Eventually, the duty manager turned up and she told me they had experienced a booking error on their system. This basically meant they only had single rooms available. This was in itself a disappointment but not a disaster, at least we all had a bed for the night  or so I thought! It transpired we were expected to share single beds! Two single beds for four adults. My husband is over 6Ft, there is no way we would have slept a wink. We were not even to receive a reduction in the room rate, I was told we would be given a discount on our next stay!!!!!! By this time, it was gone 6:30pm and my mother and I had less than an hour to get showered and changed and travel to the theatre. I asked the duty manager if she could book us another room at an alternative Thistle hotel as the single beds were not acceptable. I patiently explained that we were running out of time and that we needed to at least shower for our evening out. She offered us a hotel near Euston station which would have been fine at 3pm but at gone 6:30pm we did not have enough time to get there, get changed and get back to Covent Garden for the theatre. We were told if we insisted on staying at another hotel we could not use the facilities at the Thistle Bloomsbury. We only wanted a quick shower! After battling with the duty manager for another ten minutes she finally relented and allowed my mother and I to get showered in one of the single rooms. My husband and father sorted out our luggage and checked us into our alternative hotel.The actual result was okay; we stayed in a nice hotel near Charing Cross. The real problem was that I really had to fight for what I had already paid for. If we had been told at 3pm of the error, instead of been checked in, we would have had plenty of time to make alternative arrangements and this would have been perfectly understandable, mistakes do happen. It was the lack of communication that was so frustrating! Even if when we had arrived at 6pm the hotel had immediately called a taxi for us, and taken us to the alternative accommodation, this too would have been ok. What was not acceptable was the waiting around, the haggling and the suggestion that four adults should be happy to pay nearly 200 to share two single beds. I would not book a room here again simply because there is a complete lack of customer care."
71,1234,"Aug 14 2006 	Like staying at Grandma's House	We stayed here saturday night, it's was really nice. Nothing like the Ritz. Our room was 215, a narrow room, probably 10ft x18ft. Had the wallpaper, floral comfortor and rufffled pillow atmosphere. Bed was smaller than what I'm used to but it was cozy with a down comfortor on it. nice vanity desk area and decent TV (although no news channels on it.) Bathroom was great and up to date fixtures, towel warmer, hair dryer and all the fixings. Reception was super nice and very helpful with the neighborhood. The Holborn tube is a 10 minute walk, the neighboorhood is very nice. Overall I liked my last night in London (Heathrow the next day was a different story!)"
72,1234,"Jun 30 2006	Charming older hotel in great location	Two of us stayed here for 2 nights June 25-27, and overall were quite satisfied with the hotel. Bid through Priceline and paid $110+tax per night, which came to about $134 total.Best points:LocationFriendly, efficient staffMinuses:Rooms on the smaller sideRooms might not be equipped with all 4-star amenitiesWe arrived around 11am and tried to see if we could check in, but weren't surprised to be told that we'd have to wait till 2pm. We were able to leave our bags with the concierge, and when we came back around 5pm, a room was ready for us. Priceline had only guaranteed a room with two twin beds, and that was what the hotel had told me we had when I called them after winning my Priceline bid, but when we showed up, they told us we had a &quot;Double Deluxe.&quot; The first room we were given was, mistakenly, a twin room, but as soon as I went back down to the desk, we were given a double with no problem. I got no Priceline attitude from anyone, and all the staff (3 desk staff and 2 concierges) I dealt with were friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out were a breeze, and they also had no problem with us leaving a bag with them for one more night after we'd already checked out. However, since the reception desk is small, and I only ever saw one person working there at a time, I can imagine that when it is busier, there could be a wait.Room was small by U.S. standards, but not terribly cramped. There was a small loveseat as well as a desk and chair. The window had a very wide sill, so we put one suitcase there, and another on the floor in front of the closet. Bathroom was older and not completely without evidence of that, so I can imagine some U.S. customers being displeased, but it was fine for me. The bathtub was deep enough to take a nice bath, although the shower worked in an odd way that took me a few moments to figure out. (In order to adjust the temperature, you had to adjust the bathtub faucets; to make the shower hotter, you turned on the cold water bathtub faucet to divert the cold water away!) Air-conditioning worked very well, although it was on the noisier side.The television was small, probably only a 13-inch screen, and had only a few stations (probably the 5 terrestrial ones), but we weren't in London to watch tv so I didn't really care. There was no clock at all, but this was true of all the three hotels we stayed in in England. Internet available in the room if you had a laptop, but we made use of the BT pay Internet machine in the lobby instead (1 pound for every 15 minutes, although if you go out in the world, you can find Internet cafe where 1 pound buys 1 or even 2 hours of time.) There was supposedly a way to set the tv as an alarm, but we never needed to make use of it. (You could also get a wake-up call if you asked.) There was an iron and a (fairly old) built-in hair-dryer. No mini-bar in our room, but not a big deal for us.Bed was firm and quite comfortable, but not being used to sleeping without a topsheet (European custom is a comforter only), I was hot the first night (we turned up the AC the second night). Pillows are also quite flat (another thing that seemed common in England), so be sure to request extra pillows if you need them. Room was very quiet both nights.As others have commented, this is an older hotel. The outside of it could do with a good cleaning (brick looks grimey), and parts of the common areas have a faded feel with respect to the condition of the carpet etc., although during our second day, they were replacing parts of the stairway carpet. However, it also has a certain charm -- there's a nicely furnished sitting area around the reception desk, and the stairway has chandelier-type lights.Location was really convenient. We were 5 minutes walk or less from the Holborn tube station on the Picadilly (blue) line (which is the line that goes to Heathrow Airport) as well as the Tottenham Court Road tube station on the Central (red) line. The hotel is a very easy walk to the heart of Soho, as well as being blocks away from the British Museum.All in all, I think it was a good deal for what we paid during one of the busiest times in London (first week of Wimbledon), even though it was admittedly on the lower side of the 4-star range. We came back to London after one night away, and got the Cumberland Marble Arch, which was superb; I think if we'd stayed at the Cumberland Hotel first and then came to the Thistle Bloomsbury, we would've have been let down, but as the first hotel we experienced in London, we were very pleased."
73,1234,"May 26 2006	Charles Dickens slept here	No, Charles didn't sleep here, but I think the Thistle Hotel group might have inherited his mattress for use in room 223, given its advanced age and lumpiness. Overall though, the Thistle is a clean, secure, convenient pied-a-terre for your time in London. Yes, it's probably due for a renovation, but if you can get past the dirty facade (nothing a good sandblasting wouldn't solve) and the odd patch of duct-tape on the hallway carpets, we feel it was very good value for the price paid. It was part of a package deal, so it's hard to say exactly what we paid for the Thistle Bloomsbury, but it probably worked out to about $150 per room per night. This represents excellent value, based on our previous experience with London Hotels.Our room, bathroom and walk-in closet (!) were spacious by English hotel standards, and featured conveniences such as daily newspapers, coffee, tea and cookies, iron and trouser press, safe, even a heated towel rack. The room was kept scrupulously clean and well presented by the cheerful maid service. The rest of the staff don't exactly radiate warmth or charm, but were unfailingly polite and efficient.The entertainnment options aren't much by North American standards (five TV channels plus radio alarm) but when you have the whole city of London, (and the West End!) at your doorstep, this is the last thing to worry about. It's a five minute walk to Leicester Square, and an even shorter walk to the nearest tube station.Our rate included a daily hot breakfast in the lobby restaurant. This consisted of a decent range of hot and cold breakfast items, served buffet style, and was a great start to a long day of sightseeing. The choices don't vary much from day to day, but the food was always hot, plentiful and of decent quality... and at London restaurant prices, this is a significant saving on eating breakfast out. We ate a big breakfast at 7am, and seldom felt the need to eat for another six hours!I was going to rate this hotel a &quot;neutral&quot; but after considering the value we received for the price we paid, I have to bump it up a notch to &quot;above average&quot;. If we were travelling at peak season rates, or paying the rack rate, I might be a little less enthusiastic.So, once the people at Thistle Hotels have spent a few pounds in sprucing up the property and replaced that saggy old mattress, we'll be back!"
74,1234,"May 17 2006	Very nice older hotel	This is a very nice older hotel. Yes, it could benefit from an update but its generally in fine condition. You can tell this was formerly an elegant hotel and it stills retains a sense of that. It is the nicest hotel I have stayed at in London for under $140/night so far. The rooms are very large by London standards (which would still be a bit smaller than an American first time visitor would likely expect) and my room (225) even had a walk in closet. The room and public areas were very clean. There were no mechanical problems at all during my stay.They have a very reasonably priced room service menu and you can have breakfast brought to your room for an addl 3 pound fee (assuming it is already included in your rate, not all rates include this). The breakfast buffet in the restaurant was plentiful and very good. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and they arranged a babysitter for me on short notice. The hotel is in a great location near the British Museum and shopping streets. The only downside for me was that the front lobby is not stroller accessible as you must go up a short set of steps. Hotel staff were always helpful in any case."
75,1234,"May 5 2006 	Great location poor hotel!	The only good thing about this hotel was its location - right near Oxford St and conveniently placed for the theatres. Other than that, this hotel has nothing going for it! I only stayed for one night but it was enough to put me off ever returning. My single room was dark, dusty (you could see big clumps of it sticking to the walls) and extremely shabby. It had ripped wallpaper hanging off the walls, mysterious marks all over the ceiling and tired, 1970s style furnishing. The view was of the back of the hotel - terrible - lots of industrial type fans etc and the curtains were grey with pollution I presume.I specifically asked for a wake-up call when I checked in but this never occurred and my breakfast was a huge disappointment and late (I ordered room service) - it had obviously been sitting somewhere out in the kitchen for a long while before they brought it up as the youghurt and juice had a thick 'skin' floating on top. The fruit salad was warm and straight out of a tin, and hot chocolate cold. I could barely touch it and at such an expensive price, I expected MUCH better.A huge let-down, avoid at all costs!!"
76,1234,"Apr 29 2006	Clean 	When I first read the reviews posted here about the Thistle Bloomsbury I was alarmed and tried to cancell the reservations but I got them thru Priceline and could not. I was pleasantly surprised. Rooms were clean, towels fluffy, bedding clean and very comfy. Staff was great. Called for ice a few times they weere there in minutes! Nice little bar, but we did not eat in the retaurant but ordered room service once and it was tasty. Its a little shabby in the public rooms and not American 4 star. No view and the windows were a bit dingy but it was quiet and the location was beyond reproach. Around the corner from everything, restaurants, cafes, pubs, Covent Garden, Britsh Museum, West End. We were delighted that it was not in the more busy touristy area like Marble Arch. I got a great deal $90 a night and Bloomsbury is so covenient! Bus at doorstep (literally) a short ride to Harrods, Knightsbrige, Hyde Park Kensington, the tube was a short walk, but we prefered to get an all day bus pas for about $6.50 and hop on &amp; off. It is near all the cool stuff, the Tower, Westminster, Big Ben, Parliament etc. yet it was distinclty quieter for strolling to Russel Square etc. and we never left a 4 block radius for dining and Pubs it was a lovely safe area with beautiful Edwardian buildings. The Lobby was cozy, not grand, fireplace was lit and you could get coffee service. They also had an inexpensive internet access machine there. Staff was excellent. Be warned London is expensive. We would go back again in a heartbeat. Note: they say they have coffee makers its only a pot that heats boiling water. But they supply assorted teas, coffees, sugar, biscuits etc. in each room. Also there is an iron and ironing board in each room. They supply citrus scented toiletries, shampoos etc and nice bar soap. Each bathroom has a decent wall mounted hair dryer."
77,1234,"Apr 3 2006	A good deal!	All in all a good hotel that we got at a very reasonable rate. Helpful staff that changed our errorly booked twin room to a normal double room without hesitating. The room was spacious, the shower and bath just fine. It's not really what one might call a modern design, but it was really cosy and clean. Shortly: There was absolutely nothing to complain."
78,1234,"Mar 23 2006	Great deal for the price	If you aren't expecting a 5 star hotel, you won't be disappointed. The location alone makes it worthwhile. The hotel could use some work, especially in the hallways. The room we stayed in was good sized (by European standards), clean and comfortable. The staff was very helpful, and when we had a problem with the rooms TV it was fixed immediately. We didnt have breakfast included in our deal so we didnt eat there, but there were plenty of nearby cafes and coffee shops that were very reasonably priced. Overall, a good experience and I would stay there again."
79,1234,"Dec 26 2005	Terrible	There are other hotels in this price range that are much better. I was told it is a four star but it is not like any four star I have stayed in the UK. The room was overlooking a major road, with some 'stuck on' bits of double glazing that offered no noise prevention.Bathroom in desparate need of repair - bathroom panel rotted in places and patches on the ceiling.Cleanliness a real problem - headboards were filthy and there was a crushed biscuit behind the door from the last occupant.I do not want visitors to the UK to think this is the usual standard of hotel.Just so you know we had a standard room, not executive. Perhaps these have been decorated and cleaned?"
80,1234,"Dec 13 2005	Great location...and that's about it	If you are looking for a spacious room right near the theater district for a very reasonable price, Thistle Bloomsbury is for you. If those are the only things you care about, read no further.If you care about things like having a working toilet or a hotel that looks like it has been updated since WW2, this is probably not the right place for you. One particularly comical scene was when my wife started screaming because the side of the tub fell off to reveal a never-never land of dusty and soot-covered pipes. It was a learning experience for me as I was unaware up to that point that tubs were ever manufactured in anything but one piece. I had to laugh- although in throwing my head back to laugh I unfortunately saw the crumbling ceiling above which I was sure would fall on me everytime I was at the sink. We reported our tub calamity to the front desk before we went out for the evening and to no one's surprise, they did nothing about it. Other problems included being charged 50 pounds for breakfast that we didnt eat and the on demand movies not working. Still, at least we got some funny stories out of it. Recommended for: cheap accomodation in the heart of LondonNot recommended for: honeymooners, people without a sense of humor, people who demand top-notch service and posh surroundings."
81,1234,Nov 26 2005	Very Tired	Not a happy Bunny.I stayed 1 Night with my daughter.Room not ready at 1300hrs.This is a very typical chain hotelThe room we had been circa 1975.Only one lift was working during our stay.And the room we had (421) is in very much need of a make over.The windows were so dirty it was pointless looking out of them.The shower didnt work.The TV welcome message was unreadable due to the TV not being turned in.The carpets on the landing outside our room had been repaired with GAFFER tape.The staff where very pleasant and I feel working against the odds with the building in the state it was in.Please Thistle I am sure you can do better than this.I will give the Bloomsbury a miss next time
82,1234,"Nov 13 2005 	Other hotels are available...	This is an old hotel, which is greatly in need of renovation due to an unacceptable amount of wear and tear for a 4* property. We had no hot or cold running water for over 1 hour on Saturday morning due to &quot;the hotel being fully occupied and a lot of people taking showers at the same time&quot; (according to a message on the TV screen - barely legible, as it was not tuned in properly). When water was available, the temperature of the shower swung from freezing to scalding without warning. We experienced poor service at the front desk both checking in and out (it took 20 minutes for the receptionist to come up with the correct bill). Two strangers (hotel staff) walked into our room without knocking on separate occasions. Quite probably there is a greater atmosphere on the moon than in the hotel bar (poor service here, too). The only positive point was the hotels location just off Oxford Street. However, there are other hotels in the area with just as good a location, so theres not really that much going for it."
83,1234,"Jun 27 2005	Really good value for money	Stayed at the hotel for 1 night and was pleased with the room allocated. The beds were really comfortable, with crisp clean linen and soft clean towels for the bathroom. The room also had an iron and ironing board which is a plus. The breakfast was one of the better ones I have experienced in London and the staff we very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location, short stroll to the nearest tube and Oxford Street. I agree with some of the reviews who commented that hotel could benefit from a little redecoration, but for a London hotel it was more than adequate. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for good value for money."
84,1234,"Apr 4 2005	Fair value for money	We spent 2 nights with 2 adults and 2 kids in 2 rooms from April 1st to 3rd 2005. We booked through londowntown and paid a rate of 97 pound something per room and night incl. breakfast.The hotel is located conveniently near Covent Garden/Soho/Brithis Museum. Bloomsbury Way has lots of traffic however our rooms were oriented to a back yard (ugly) and pretty quiet. I don't think any of the rooms facing the street are in use, the windows there are covered with grime and look like they haven't been opened or cleaned for years.The hotel itself is okay - especially for the price we paid - , however any prejudices you might have had about english grubbyness are confirmed. In general the hotel lacks from attention to detail. Carpets are threadbare in places (bar, stairwell), laid out in a very unprofessional manner (simply cut out with strands of threads showing at the edges) - signposts have missing numbers and letters (e.g. &quot;this is a non .mokin. .loo.&quot;), some doors are squeaky. The carpets all around the hotel are in dire need of vacuuming. Generations of dust have formed in the edges along the corridors as well as the rooms. Behind the bathroom door you could find the inevitable fluff with some curly hairs. The mattress was quite new but too soft for my esteem.With the right processes and a little effort the problems could be fixed easily - there is plenty of staff around that could do the job if someone told them to.The staff especially in the restaurant and the concerge were helpful and attentive.Had I paid the official rate of 250 pounds per night, I would have raised hell - however since we had an excellent rate for London standards we were content with the price / performance ratio. What our kids liked most was the electronic elevator voice announcing &quot;doors closing&quot; etc. in a perfect Oxford English that could have been sampled from the Queen's parliament opening speech ."
85,1234,"Mar 21 2005	Lovely Hotel Fab Staff Perfect Location	We stayed at this hotel for three nights from 17th March and we were very impressed with it. We agree with some of the reviews that indicate that this is a very good three star hotel, as opposed to a four star, and the hotel is in some need of redecoration, but our room was lovely (even though it was on the mezzanine floor and had very little natural light - perfect for me who gets disturbed by light flooding through windows at 5am!!!!) and very clean and tidy, with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on - my own bed at home included!!! The breakfast selection was very good, although there appeared to be capacity problems on the sunday morning, but this didn't spoil our weekend. The hotel is perfectly situated if you are planning a vist to the theatre, and specifically &quot;The woman in White&quot; which is about 5 mins walk away. Leicester Square, Piccadilly and Covent Garden are all within 10-15 mins walk away, and Oxford Street is just round the corner.All in all, we had a lovely break and would recommend this hotel wholeheartedly."
86,1234,"Mar 9 2005	Would definitely stay there again	I stayed at the Thistle Bloomsbury for 4 nights in mid-February. My room was a double executive, and I felt it was quite a good size for central London. The ensuite bathroom was enormous and immaculate - its only problem was a rather noisy power shower. The room was also clean and tidy other than a few smudge marks on the ceiling near the ceiling fan. Perhaps it was due to the fact it was off-season, but the only noise I heard from outside my room was the occasional slam of a door from other guest rooms.I had no troubles communicating with the staff and found them to be very helpful in arranging for an early-morning taxi. The dinner service in the restaurant was quite slow but otherwise pleasant; I did not take breakfast in the hotel restaurant so cannot comment on that service.The location of this hotel was extremely convenient - a few blocks from the Holborn tube station on the Central &amp; Piccadilly lines, on a bus route from Oxford Street (with a stop just before the hotel), walking distance from Covent Garden and the British Museum.Based on my overall experience, I would choose to stay at the Thistle Bloomsbury again, especially if I could match the great off-season rate I was able to get."
87,1234,"Mar 8 2005	Great location great bathroom great Bed	From the reviews that I read here, I was leary, but this place was great! We had a great price on the room, though the cabbie overcharged us getting from the airport to the hotel. The bed was wonderful and the bathroom was quite large. Being from America and expecting things to be open until 4 in the morning, it was nice to be able to stay up late at the bar downstairs in the lobby and to order room service after, say 11 pm. Again, I had received mixed reviews on staying in Soho, but that was a great spot. My boyfriend and I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. There were record shops, clothing stores, clubs, and pubs all nearby. The staff was delightful and so were the other guests we met. Certainly give this place a chance! Great location. Great bathroom...bigger than most I have seen in Europe. And, the bed, if it hadn't been our first time in London, we would have never left it."
88,1234,"Feb 17 2005	not a 4 star but still pretty good	After reading the reviews on the Thistle Bloomsbury here, I was really bummed. Of particular concern were comments that the rooms were not clean. But the Thistle had come up as the cheapest choice for my trip to London so crossing my fingers, I booked the hotel anyway. To be honest, this 4 star should really be a 3 star. The wallpaper was peeling/scratched and the windows were dirty. But the rest of the room and the bathroom were absolutely fine. Both rooms were quite clean, with a nice towel warmer in the bathroom and the water pressure in the shower was great. Again, its not 4 star and definitely dont expect boutique hotel style design but for what I paid I felt I got a good deal.And for those who complained about the staff not speaking English fluently, well, it is an EU member country and England is a prime choice so people can learn English. This is quite common especially in the service industry. I personally didn't have any problems communicating with the staff.In short, Id say, great value, great location, great service."
89,1234,"Feb 12 2005	Perfect for a short break	My family( Myself, my wife and our sons 5 and 8 ) stayed in a family room. It was very close to Kings x station , British Museum is round the corner and it is very close to West End attractions. Also the fact that Bloomsbury is a relatively quiet area, made this a very pleasant stay.The Hotel really was fine, it was clean and the Consierge and other staff were most helpful. The breakfasts were great and i would certailnly stay again. If people want the Ritz, then they should be prepared to pay Ritz prices or stop complaining about such a good hotel."
90,1234,"Dec 13 2004	What a Christmas present!	Just spent an excellent weekend in London courtesy of Thistle Bloomsbury. Booked an Executive twin room for three nights, on arrival was told that all Exec twins were taken so we were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge. Room was spacious, clean, well equipped, quiet, very comfortable and decorated in a warm eastern style. Check-in staff were friendly and welcoming, breakfast was well presented and despite limited space the staff worked hard to keep the tables available. Seems like we stayed at a different Thistle Bloomsbury to some of the others commenting on the hotel. Negatives; smell of tobacco smoke in the public areas, but I guess this will be cured when the smoking ban in bars and restaurants takes effect next year and current renovation of church next door which gives the entrance a run-down look. Will definitely go back."
91,1234,"Nov 30 2004 	Oh the anecdotes this hotel has given me	What was it about this hotel that earned it the unenviable prestige of 'the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in my life'? (And I've been in some pretty terrible ones, including one in Majorca I nicknamed 'the cave'). Well let's see:* the bathroom of horrors. Deceased arachnids, a toilet I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy and a bath that had apparently never seen a cleaner. I got washed in the sink so's not to touch anything.*The toilet was hanging off the wall, as were most of the light fittings.* The door didn't lock, so I was forced to wedge a chair under the handle.* I felt very uncomfortable with the hotel staff, especially when one man insisted on walking me to my door to make sure I could get in with the keycard. And then he tried to step inside the room after me.* I was kept awake all night by the strangest singing from the church opposite (I think). My colleague and I didn't know what to make of it, but it was not only very spooky but also intrusive.* It was exceptionally difficult to make oneself understood to the receptionist, who was at best, disinterested and at worst, just plain rude.This hotel was like something out of a bad b-movie. If it weren't so late when we checked in, my colleague and I would have checked right out again. I would never recommend this hotel, and will never stay there again.The plus point? It gives me lots of stories to tell about the world's worst hotel."
92,1234,Nov 15 2004	Absolutely the worst !!!
93,1234,Aug 23 2004	Peeling paint in the bathroom

102,1234,Oct 22 2007 	Einigermaen gutes Hotel
1,1235,Oct 29 2009 	Fantastic. Should be upgraded to 5 star status.	I booked the Executive suite for 2 nights as a surprise for my sister's birthday. We were upgraded to the Royal suite. The suite was huge with large windows overlooking Hyde Park and views of the city. That was an experience of a lifetime. The Room and views were fantastic. We had a lovely dinner at the Thai Restaurant. The staff and service were excellent. I will recommend the Lancaster London to my friends and will be booking another weekend package.Vendetta Lewis
2,1235,"Oct 2 2009 	Pleased I followed the recommendations	We were looking for a decent hotel, centrally located and at a reasonable price. The Lancaster fitted all our requirements and more. It is clean and while the rooms could be more spacious we were out most of the time and this is London after all. The service was great and the location fantastic being 50m from the entrance to Hyde park and 30m from Lancaster Gate underground. Paddington train station was less than 10 minutes walking. Also Oxford St was a 10 minute walk away. We found nice places to eat between the hotel and Paddington station. Overall we were very impressed and would definately go abck there."
3,1235,Jul 29 2009 	100 a night and no toilet in the room	When I booked I presumed that there would be an ensuite bathroom. There was a shower in the corner of the room and a sink but the toilet was across the landing - rubbish. No lift. Pillows were rock hard as well. For the price I would much prefer to stay in a travel lodge type hotel where at least you can be sure of what you are getting.
4,1235,"Jul 11 2009 	Great location clean room and outstanding value	We found this quaint little place near The British Museum, located on a very quiet street midway between the beautifully tranquil Russell Square and Bloomsbury Square (neither one more than 100 yards from the front door). Location in Bloomsbury is outstanding, a few blocks from the Russell Square underground (Piccadilly line, direct underground to/from Heathrow). The hotel has no elevator and tight stairs, but we managed easily. Shower in our room was adequate, toilet was shared by a few rooms, but was always spotless and available. Room is small but adequate (we were there only to sleep). No air conditioning, but they do provide a fan and in-room coffee/tea. Continental breakfasts were ample and quite good. Front desk staff very polite, efficient and helpful. Certainly lacking some of the amenities one might expect of a luxury hotel (such as high speed wireless internet ), but cannot beat the value. Would definitely stay there again."
5,1235,"Jun 27 2009 	Great room helpful staff - enjoyed the stay!	They did not have any garden rooms available, but my sister and I were given a first floor (one level above street) street-facing room. We did not have an issue with street noise beyond normal city sounds. There were one men's and one women's toilet for sharing by about three rooms - I never saw anyone else coming or going from those closest to our room, and they were always clean. The room was a bit more spacious than I expected, with a lovely little coffee/tea service station. The staff was extremely accommodating (they even found us a complimentary mending kit at a sister hotel and brought it over!) and there were no hidden charges upon check out. Internet was expensive (and not wifi), so we went without that.Though the weather in London was pretty perfect (just around 70F most days, I think), the room did get very warm the first day/night. THEN we figured out how to open the huge windows, and did so each time we returned to the room, and the temperature was fine for the rest of the trip.Overall, the Lancaster was a great deal in a great location, and I would stay there again. Really perfect location, two blocks over from busy Bloomsbury St, and an easy walk into the heart of the West End."
6,1235,"Jun 19 2009 	Room was fine but no loo..?	Stayed at the Lancaster for one night with work. Booked a standard double room. Just assumed this would have a bathoom too however when I got in the room, it had a shower and sink but no toilet. There were seperate mens and ladies loo's up the corridor. Very weird seens as the rooms were nice and the shower and sink were modern, why wouldnt they just put a toilet in too?? I didnt have a problem - and as work was paying it was fine - when asked reception they said they do have some rooms with full en-suites so might be worth checking before you book if you want your own toilet!!"
7,1235,"May 8 2009 	Are they having cash flow problems?	I was treated as if I were a flight risk. On check-in, credit card was run and closed out for full 4-day stay. Asked about local calls. Staff could not tell me estimated charges and recommended I buy a phone card. Tried to call with phone card, but room phone was &quot;blocked.&quot; Was asked to pay 20 Pound deposit up front to unblock phone. Was asked to pay for breakfast in advance. &quot;Recently remodeled,&quot; but no Internet. No lifts. Rooms were nicely equipped, but stuffy and overheated - no fans or ventilation system. provided.. Good breakfast and convenient to Underground."
8,1235,"Apr 1 2009 	An excellent stay	From the doorman to reception, restaurant and housekeeping the staff were extremely friendly and effiicient. Breakfast was excellent and attention to detail was paramount. Couldn't fault. Look forward to returning."
9,1235,"Mar 6 2009 	Tiny dated bedrooms	Great on-site parking, check-in fine. Hotel bedrooms are very dated and rather bland in decor can't even say minimalistic - just bland. Bathrooms exceptionally tiny and very dated. Waited a long time for an elevator they could do with more."
10,1235,"Jan 20 2009 	Not even a 3 Star Hotel.	Booked 2 Standard Rooms for a new year's Eve stay to have a quality time. The hotel building from outside loks amazing with its high rising tower. The reception and lobby area is grandand very beautifully decorated. Gives an impression of a hotel for older rich people and politicians. We had to wait half an hour to actually get our keycard because the hotel did not recieve any confirmations from travelocity.co.uk. Luckily we had the print outs of reservations but it still took well long to finally get checked in. The staff are just about to satisfactory standards. The room we were given was on a high floor with great views of whatever was outside. The room decor was very very old fashioned. The beds were not secured to floor. They were so light that they would slide away if you stood next to them. Not comfortable at all. The bathroom was adaquate and very basic. No real feeling of a 4 star based hotel. No coffee or tea facilities either in the room. The hotel has good connection with all travel modes.The check out took really long. Overall we spent 300 per room for Standard!!! Got absolutely no value to the money. I would not stay here again just because the rooms, their decoe, amenities and overall quality is dissapointing."
11,1235,"Jan 10 2009 	Excellent budget accomodation- my new London crash pad	I stayed at this hotel on a Friday night , using it as a crash pad after a night out. The hotel was the cheapest I found and at 45 for a single and continental breakfast ,I thought it was a bargain (booked on hotel website for cheapest rate) and was dubious as to what I'd find. I was aware that there was no toilet in the room and I hoped that this the only reason the the room was so cheap. The staff were polite, the room spotless and in good order with plenty towels, hairdryer and toiletries and even magazines to read. The toilet facilities were immaculate and there were plenty available for use. The continental breakfast was excellent with good quality produce and endless hot toast and tea. Also as a single female resident I felt very safe in the intimate surroundings.I will definitely use this hotel again and don't be put off by toilets not being in some of the rooms it really isn't a problem!"
12,1235,"Oct 7 2008 	Surpassed our expectations of a budget hotel	This little Bloomsbury hotel, is ideally located 5 walking minutes from the British Museum and is set in the middle of a very quiet street that ends in two small parks. We pre-purchased underground pass for the whole stay, and found we didn't really need it. Entry to underground is located near by. We do like walking and are not very picky - in fact if you are looking for a safe, quiet hotel where you can relax after a whole day's exploration, this is an excellent choice. We have walked to Tower of London, the City hall, Westminster, etc without using pass, unless at the end of the day, when we were exhausted. When we arrived, we had fresh lilies in our room for our welcome.Granted, the toilets are outside of the room, but I never had to wait for any of them (we were on the second floor, our room was facing the garden). It's a charming hotel. It's not contemporary, but if you're looking for a 5 star hotel, you are obviously in the wrong place. The staff was very very friendly. I think they were all students. The breakfast is a big plus and although very small choice, it was really appreciated (food is rather expensive in London). We had a laugh about the shower in our room (since it is not partitioned off from the rest of the sleeping area, but we enjoyed the 12' ceilings, old style fireplace and Georgian interior design. Would we stay there again? - without a hesitation."
13,1235,"Aug 22 2008 	Great Find	For the price paid, it was perfect. Located in a very nice quiet location near Russell Square, with only a short 5-10 min walk into SoHo. On arrival, the staff were very friendly and helpful. We did have to drag our bags up the stairs, but it's not THAT MUCH of a problem, really. The room was very comfortable and quiet, with a nice leafy view of a rear courtyard and garden. The fact that there was no toilet in the actual room was not a problem either, as it was only one door down the hallway, and you can't hear anyone go there anyway. We paid around 60 pounds total per night $120 AUD, for a central, clean, quiet, and friendly hotel. You can't get much better than that in London. Will definitely be back."
14,1235,"Aug 18 2008 	recommended but book what you require.	really pleased with our stay. we were on a budget, and booked a cheap room, with shared toilet. but on arrival, we were given room 2 , one of their best rooms. large clean well appointed room, overlooking garden, with bath shower and toilet...the hotel is in good order and very well placed to walk to all of central london sites. v nice hotel, but make sure you realise some rooms have shared toilets....."
15,1235,"May 12 2008 	Great hotel wonderful location ... with a few buts ...	I have booked three nights at the hotel for my weekend in London. I booked before I read the reviews just because the location and rates were wonderful. I arrived at the hotel at noon and check in was fast and simple. My room was number 5 in the lower ground floor and was quite issolated from all the other rooms. There are no elevators in this hotel so I had to drag my suitcase down the stairs but it wasn't that bad. Having booked the hotel prior to reading the reviews I was ready for the fact the loo was outside the room but to my surprise I got a room with both shower and bath and a loo :) The room was big and spacious with a queen size bed, TV, work area, there was a ventilator, ironing board and coffee/tea making facilities. It was a great treat for a solo budget traveler and the location made it even more wonderful ! Althought in general everything was great , there are two spoilers that bothered me a bit . The first one was the strange noise I kept hearing which I figured out to be the noise of the tube on the Piccadily line that apparently passes right under the hotel :) but still it wasn't that bad as I didn't spend the day in the room and I was so tired at night that it didn't really bother my sleep. The one thing that did annoy me more than that was the fact that the hotel doesn't have a luggage room. This was especially annoying since my flight back was at 22:30 and the hotel staff weren't really keen on helping me , they could only appologise and say it was &quot;company policy&quot; so I found myself dragging my bags to Euston station (in case you would like to use this option it costs 6.5 Pounds per bag).In general I really liked my stay, since I'm a budget traveler this room was very good in comparison with other hotels I've stayed in around London even with the two small &quot;surprises&quot; I've mentioned before."
16,1235,"Apr 24 2008 	Absolutely Wonderful Location!	When my boyfriend and I arrived at the hotel, we already knew that there were no toilets in the rooms. It was directly down the hall and we NEVER had to wait to use it. The shower was a little weird and there is very little privacy. Traveling with anyone else would make for an ackward situation. The location is absolutely wonderful as it is right by the Russell Square Tube station and not far from Holburn tube station. When traveling here however, make sure you give the taxi driver the address for there are TWO Lancaster Hotels in London. He took us to the Royal Lancaster first and then to our hotel. Just make sure you're clear! The staff were friendly though not very knowledgable of &quot;tourist&quot; activities. They have brochures in the lobby of London tours and things but you have to call to book yourself and they charge your for the local phone call. There are no lifts and we had to haul our luggage up only 1 flight of stairs and there was no bell-boy. There is no available internet but WiFi cafes all over nearby. Take advantage of the breakfast too! It was a great value and very good. We did not travel to London to hang out all day in our hotel room. The time we did spend there was quite pleasant. We would definately stay here again."
17,1235,"Apr 15 2008 	Great disappointment	I made a booking at this hotel through a travel site and do not recall to have gotten a clear explanation (and went back to the reservation site before writing this review) that the toilet was in the hallway. Had I known, I would not have booked this hotel. I had also requested &quot;twin beds&quot; as I was with a friend.We had to sleep on a full bed as the hotel does not have rooms with twin beds (they proposed a rolling small bed which we refused as we would not have had enough room).Furthermore, the shower/bassin are in the room. Yes, in the room, you shower next to the bed! My friend and I had NO PRIVACY at all! Great disappointment, as the hotel is a very nice building decorated with taste. The hotel is part of Bloomsbury Townhouse Collection, I must say no effort whtsoever was made to try to solve my problem. They have several other hotels in the same street and not once anyone said that they were going to check for availability of a room with PRIVATE full bathroom in another property. They just said &quot;sorry&quot;, but as we all know, that doesn't solve the problem - or make you feel better."
18,1235,"Mar 11 2008 	Excellent hotel	Noting the comments on this website, we booked an en suite room, which DOES have a toilet in the room. It was also in the back, overlooking the garden, and was extremely quiet and comfortable. The room is a very good size, as is the bathroom, and clean. The location really cannot be beat: halfway between the Holborn and Russell Square stations, 10 minute walk to Covent Garden, 10 minute walk to Soho, right next to the British Museum. We were very pleased with this hotel and would most definitely stay here on a return trip to London."
19,1235,"Nov 15 2007 	Disgraceful	Arrived at The Lancaster yesterday evening. Waited 10 minutes while the (lone) receptionist dealt with another guest, only to discover that the hotel had &quot;inadvertently&quot; cancelled my booking, and now had no rooms available. Waited another 15 minutes while they sorted out another room at their sister hotel, The Grange Strathmore. Supposedly 15 minutes away, their driver took an hour to find it, and when I got there the place was frankly a dump. I'd never use either hotel again."
20,1235,"Oct 27 2007 	My new hotel in London	This is a very nice property. Yes, the toilets are down the hall but then I saved a LOT of money - every comparable property with a toilet in the room was at least 30% more expensive. There was shower and sink and so it was not that often I had to leave the room to use the facilities. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the breakfast above average and the location AMAZING. This is my new hotel in London."
21,1235,Oct 19 2007 	Good for couples	Definately great location for travellers using the tube. At first got a shock as we had heavy luggages and there was no lift... but the concierge carried our suitcases up 3 floors! D room was big and very clean. Its true no toilet in the room but 1 loo is shared between 3 rooms and it was always very clean. We never encountered anyone using the loo. The area is not noisy so we had a good night sleep. The breakfast is also suffiecient and the staff were always friendly. I would definately use this budget hotel again when I am in London.
22,1235,"Sep 29 2007	disappointed	Just back from visit to London and stayed here with my 12 year old daughter. Was very disappointed to discover no toilet facilities in room and no mention whatsoever of this on website, would not have booked if I'd realised. Obviously I could not allow my daughter to go to bathroom on her own so had to accompany her every time as you never know whats about! The idea of the shower in room is also bizzare unless you're sharing with your partner. Also even though room was clean on our arrival a pile of dirty, wet tiles were left on bedroom floor, I informed staff but they didn't seem too bothered. Location is good but thats the only thing going for this hotel, corridors smell damp and musty and rooms are only adequate."
23,1235,"Sep 19 2007 	I would recommend	I would recommend this hotel. The location is great as it is within walking distance of the Russell Square Tube Station, as well as Covent Garden, The British Museum and the British Library. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast was more than sufficient. The rooms were very spacious for England and very clean. The shower and sink are located in the room with no type of partition separating them from the rest of the room so I wouldn't recommend this set-up or hotel if you are going to be sharing a room with someone you do not wish to see in the shower. The toilet (half bathroom) is down the hallway but they are kept clean and I never encountered another guest when I went to use the toilet. I would recommend the room I stayed in, room 206, as it had a semi-private stairway to the lobby and no one other guest seemed to used the toilet across the hall. Also, it overlooks the backyard."
24,1235,Sep 7 2007 	No loos in bedroom	I booked via expedia and the fact the toilets were outside the rooms wasnt very clear from website. On saying that - you would find it hard to find a hotel at this price and location and in fact the toilets were not a problem. As the last review says - the shared toilet is very clean and i never encountered anyone else on the corridor never mind the loo.
25,1235,"May 12 2007 	No loos in bedrooms!	It seems harder to find cheap 3-4-star deals in London this year and we had to look quite a bit before finding this hotel on Expedia, We chose it for its Russell Square location (Tube station, numerous good shops and eateries close by, near British Museum, too, and you can walk to Oxford Street shops) and also thought it was a place we'd liked the look of on the way to the museum on our last short break. We were in fact out by a block...The Lancaster is one of a chain of hotels covering all price ranges, with several more properties in the same quiet street, and is quite basic - only a breakfast restaurant and no bar as such, though you can use such facilities at adjacent properties, though that's not quite the same as having them in-house.It's immaculately clean with friendly foreign staff but the layout with hand basin and shower in-room - but lavatories/loos/washrooms/toilets outside - is unusual. One gents' and one ladies' to every three rooms may not suit all, though it's not dissimilar to some English B&amp;Bs. If you have a room at the back, as we did, the loos are almost right outside, but it's a few metres walk for the other two. They are serviced many times a day and were always spotless, and we never had to queue, but it may be an issue for some.We also noted some loose light fittings in our room and were served sour(ing) milk the one time we stayed in for the inclusive breakfast. This was likely due to the fact that the property has no a/c and is very hot in places, including the breakfast room. We found we could keep our room passably cool in an unseasonably warm London early spring (end April) by opening up the incredibly powerful shower steam extractor vent and creating a cross draft with a cracked-open sash window (tricky, so mind your fingers) though the noise level from the extractor may bug some guests. The back rooms look out onto gardens and this is the quietest hotel we have ever stayed in in London - no sound from adjacent rooms, TVs, traffic, etc., and it was pretty full.The location and friendly staff nonetheless make this little hotel worth a look, especially if on a budget. There are several nice restaurants adjacent to the Tube and, if you turn right, and then left exiting the station you'll find a new shopping centre with Waitrose supermarket and several more nice restaurants and cafes. A 24-hour Tesco is also right opposite the station. Walking to Oxford St takes about 10-15 minutes (Tottenham Court Road end) and there are numerous bus routes and black cabs about."
26,1235,"Apr 3 2007 	Good budget hotel	If location and value are what you are looking for the Lancaster is a very good option. The hotel is a block from the British Museum and also very close to two underground stops. The room was quite large with a clean comfortable queen size bed and was overall in decent shape. The only reason I do not rate this hotel higher is that strangely the room had a shower and sink but no toilet. This was never really a problem for me or my wife but I could see why it would be for some people. I didnt look closely but it appeared that there were 6 individual toilets 3 mens 3 womens shared by 9 rooms on each floor. (Neither me or my wife had an enounter with any other guest durring our stay) All in all if you are looking for a clean inexpensive, no frills room I highly recommend the Lancaster."
27,1235,"Mar 9 2007	Very nice but where's the loo??	On the whole I found The Lancaster a very nice place. It was clean, tidy, the staff were very friendly and welcoming and continental breakfast was pretty good too.My room was very large indeed (especially for a single traveller) and comfortable (queen sized bed and nice sofa) and there was quite a nice view (particularly for London) looking out over the back of the hotel.However (and it's a rather large however) the room was lacking a WC and we had to share the loo with others on the floor. I'm a seasoned backpacker and am more than used to sharing. Therefore such things wouldn't usually bother me, but for the fact that I had also booked in a work colleague who expects full en-suite facilities and I wouldn't have booked it for him if I had known. I have subsequently checked the Hotel's website and it really doesn't explain that certain rooms have only semi ensuite facilities.What I don't quite understand is that the the room was so large, they could easily have installed a full ensuite bathroom and it still be far larger than usual London rooms.If you don't mind sharing a toilet with other gusts, I can thoroughly recommend the Lancaster as a very nice place to stay indeed."
28,1235,"Jan 24 2007 	Regular visitor	Great location, right next door to the British museum. I thought the staff work very friendly and professional. They seem to listen to thier customers as most of the negative reviews did not apply during my stay last month. I get to stay in London on business quite alot and for the price I thought the lancaster was great value for money."
29,1235,"Oct 26 2006 	OK for the price	I stayed for four nights in one of their semi-ensuite single rooms on the first floor. The rooms have sink and shower, but toilets, 6 to serve the 9 rooms, are off the corridor.The room was high-ceilinged and small, but nicely furnished and comfortable. The glaring exception is the cheap fluorescent light fixture over the sink/mirror. There was no lighting to read in bed, no way to turn off the room lighting from the bed, and no night shelf or table near the bed. Surprising they couldnt have come up with something, given the brilliant little cupboard they designed and built for the tea fixings.Bedford Place is pretty noisy, so windows need to be closed for sleeping.Breakfast room on ground floor is very nice and a good continental breakfast is served - juice, cereals, three kinds of sliced meat, sliced cheese, croissants and a variety of rolls."
30,1235,"Oct 18 2006 	Great hotel for a great price!	We booked the Lancaster Hotel direct from laterooms.com &amp; it was fantastic. EXTREMELY large, by European standards, and quite clean - this hotel fit our needs perfectly. The room had a king size bed, a desk/chair, and a nice sitting area. In addition, there was a shower &amp; sink in the room. The WC was just down the hall &amp; was extremely clean and only shared with 2 other rooms. Continental breakfast was included in the price of $110/night. A great deal. The hotel was right near Russell Square, which was nice neighborhood. We felt completely safe there. I would absolutely recommend this hotel."
31,1235,"Oct 15 2006 	Charmed but basic	The Lancaster was brilliantly situated for my purposes, so from that end it was perfect. It was also cheap - 50 for one night, including breakfast - the bed was comfortable, the room clean and as the room was at the back of the building overlooking the garden, it was very quiet. BUT - had an ensuite shower only, no loo, which I was unaware of when I made the booking. I raised this at the desk and it was pointed out that 'Single basic' means no full ensuite. Hmm - more clarity in the information me thinks. It was OK I suppose, but not brilliant. Little things irritated me like the TV didn't work and I had to get someone to change the aerial, the shower tray was not as clean as perhaps I might have expected, and there was a huge cigarette burn in the duvet cover. I was surprised to see that this was listed as a 3 star hotel, as it did not have the luxuriousness, which I would have expected. Still, if you like a small hotel, with no lift in an excellent location for little money and no loo in your ensuite, then this is for you:)"

1,1242,"Oct 16 2009 	Don't stay here!!!	This is not a hotel. It's place that rents dirty, unsafe rooms from a receptionist with a diploma in rude. There are other comptetively priced and good hotels with a few hundred yards. Avoid the Lonsdale at all cost!!!"
2,1242,"Sep 24 2009	Needs a good clean	1st impression of the room was the wardrobe doors hanging off &amp; the mis-matched furniture....The room needed a huge clean. The net curtains looked like they hadnt been washed in about 5 years &amp; the room was FULL of cob webs that had gathered plenty of dust too. The room itself was a good size but poorly decorated. The bathroom 'pod' was very compact but clean. The bed sheets were also clean but in poor condition. The main light in the bedroom had no light shade &amp; you could see that the bulb had melted the bulb holder at some point...this light fused when we tried to turn it on &amp; one of the lights above the bed was also not working, this left us one small wall light to illuminate the room. On the plus side the hotel is in a fantastic location &amp; on a very quiet street. With a massive clean this hotel could be an affordable &amp; pleasant place to stay...however until it has been cleaned I wont be stopping there again."
3,1242,"Sep 19 2009 	DO NOT STAY HERE - unless you want bites all over you!	I am a fairly easy going traveler - after time in Thailand with just a mattress and a fan on breeze blocks I would say that it takes a lot to upset me. I have stayed in the Lonsdale twice now - once over a year ago when I had a conference nearby for work. I didn't think it was the cleanest of places with ripped wallpaper and disgusting breakfast, but it wasn't too bad. I accidently booked it again as I had 2 meetings on Thur/ Fri this week and it was close by. This time I was given a room that smelled extremely mouldy and damp (the woman next door was coughing all night - probably the damp on her lungs). While having a lie down before dinner 2 people just walked into the room. The staff were rude and uncooperative whenever I spoke to them. The icing on the cake was that when I awoke on Friday morning I was covered in bites - all over my arms, legs and feet (some even on my face), what I hope were only bedbugs (and not fleas or scabies). I was in a rush in the morning and the woman was occupied (plus hadn't noticed the itching too much at that point) so I left the hotel to get to my meeting. When I got there I noticed all the red lumps and showed it to a colleague who said it looked awful. I got home last night, the things are itching like mad and I called the hotel. The woman had some problems understanding me as I explained the bites, then said it was nothing to do with them - I said they needed to get the room cleaned thoroughly. I asked for a manager, she said there wasn't one and put the phone down on me. I have called environmental health and intend to pursue a complaint."
4,1242,"Apr 28 2009 	Great value for money great location great place to 'bed down'.	I stayed in the Lonsdale on April 25th '09. I was best man for a friend and we were celebrating his stag night so I had booked 5 rooms. I was a bit dubious about booking the Lonsdale due to the 1* reviews, but I decided to go for it as a) it was extremely cheap and b) it boasts a fantastic location.I am very glad I did book it. It is indeed in a superb location, just 3 minutes from Holborn tube and next to Russell Square in a nice street alongside some 'posh' hotels. I saw all 5 rooms we booked and all were of a reasonable standard. When I say reasonable, I mean reasonable when you are paying 60 for a room in central London Location. So, they had no nice pictures on the slightly dirty walls, the carpets weren't spotless, the paintwork could have done with a good retouch and the furniture was more suited to the 80's BUT when you are spending only an hour or so awake in the rooms per day they were great.I was also impressed with the customer service. I emailed the hotel asking about early check-in/bag storage. I recieved a phone call the next day from a nice lady telling me that she was unable to email me back but it would be fine to leave our bags in the hotel. I have had worse service from 4*+ hotels.So, I think if you're realistic and don't expect too much from a budget hotel, want just somewhere to sleep for the night you'll be more than happy with the Lonsdale."
5,1242,"Jan 24 2009 	Makes Fawlty Towers look like a nice place to stay!	Some things never change!The Lonsdale makes Fawlty Towers look like a nice place to stay!My elderly mother and I stayed in this dump back in September 1984.We had what was supposed to be the best room in the hotel, it was in back of the kitchen with no view out the window, noisy in the morning (when one was trying to sleep) and had only a [-]-in sink (the toilet was down the hall and the bathtub was upstairs).Can you believe this place came with the recommendation of a travel agent!The breakfast was highly greasy and a heart attack on a plate, the staff proved to be arrogant and mostly unfriendly. I left my Michelin London Guide book on the bed in my room and when I returned in the evening it went missing, when I told the manager he made it clear he didnt give a [-] (he was a Monty Python stereotype of the Upper Class Twit of the Year).Moreover, on our last night I returned independent of my mother around 11:00pm and rang the front door bell for the desk clerk to let me in for almost 15 minutes, finally another guest let me in (24 hour front desk is a crock). The Canadian snot that was the desk clerk then came out to demand to know what I was doing in this hotel. When I told her, I was staying there and thank you for coming to let me in. She told me I should have asked for another key on check-in, thanks for telling me on my last night [-]!Folks, pay a little more money and stay in a better place for what may well be an once-in-a-lifetime trip to London, this place proved depressing."
6,1242,"Jan 23 2009	cheap and clean and perfect location	I stayed at Lonsdale Hotel with my relatives in May 2006; perfect location, good price (70 pounds for 3 in 2 rooms), nice staff and great breakfast. Coming again to London for a week-end I naturally booked myself into this place (30 single - no bath). Had a pleasant stay; I noticed, however, that breakfast was no longer served and that the owners looked depressed : is it due to all the bad reviews I discovered in a shock... ? Although modest, the place is very clean; I would definitely call again and passed the address on to some friends. martine - geneva"
7,1242,"Jul 28 2008 	The Lonsdale... actually a really nice place	I have travelled extensively - something like 55+ countries, and I always travel on a budget, to maximise my funds and to experience each country more 'authentically'. That being said, I shop with my eyes open, and was not expecting luxury at the Lonsdale; it was after all the absolute cheapest hotel accomodation available in London at that time. I found the hotel on-line, and booked directly with the hotel (they did not take internet bookings at that time). The room was clean, bright, not too small, the breakfast was ample, and the desk staff were most helpful. We arrived early, and they actually let us use another room to get cleaned up and changed so that we could go out and about while we waited for our room to be made up. Like in a traditional B&amp;B, there was no lift, and we did not have a toilet in our room, but then again, being realistic about what we were paying for a room in the high season in the centre of London, we did not expect these. The staff helped us with information about the neighbourhood and local transportation. Located near the British Museum, the area was lively and safe, walking distance to almost everything, and very well connected to several tube lines. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay. The money we saved, we spent on great seats for West End shows and shopping. For people who expect a large hotel chain type of experience, this is NOT for you. If you want a nice budget stay in a safe, clean and friendly hotel, try the Lonsdale. I have recommended this hotel to fellow travels with realistic expectations, and they too have enjoyed their stay."
8,1242,"Jun 4 2008 	How is this place still in business?	In all my experiences of hotels all over the country I can safely say that the Lonsdale &quot;Hovel&quot; was the worst ever. Walking into the &quot;Reception&quot; - a small desk set aside in a room off the foyer with pidgeon hole rack behind for keys - I should have realised what was to come. My wife and I climbed up six flights of stairs to reach the 3rd floor after wandering through several doors as there was no indication where rooms were located. The room at first glance appeared adequate however I had to move the bedside cabinet from between the beds and push the twin beds together so that I could open the door to the &quot;en-suite&quot;. This was a 3ft x 6ft badly made plasterboard construction with a shower, washbasin and toilet crammed in. We asked for a move, mainly because of the mountainous hike but also the filthy condition of the room. We were moved to room 1 on the ground floor. Slight improvement, the fabricated &quot;en-suite&quot; was a lot cleaner but, for some reason, raised 8&quot; off the floor and the shower didn't work. The general condition of the room was shabby with filthy curtains and broken light fittings and broken windows. Disgusting."
9,1242,"Apr 28 2008 	Disgusting and dirty	Small rooms equipped in the old, ruined furniture look as never been cleaned up. Windows that cannot be neither opened nor closed. Bad air everywhere. Toilets are the worst - dirty and ruined as well. Service below expectations - long queues for breakfast. If you need a cup or plate you should ask - nobody from the hotel notices it. Food so bad as you immediately dream to be on diet. The only advantage of Lonsdale is location - close to British Museum, in the heart of London. But if you prefer to stay in nice, clean hotel better choose the other one. 4 other hotels are located on the same street as Lonsdale"
10,1242,"Mar 3 2008 	Horrible horrible horrible	Without a doubt the worst hotel I have ever seen.My two friends from Italy booked in here for 3 nights. After the first night when they had dirty sheets, found cigarette butts in the drawers and no curtains on the windows I came over to rescue them. The floors were filthy, the stairs filled with dust, the furniture broken and the breakfast only offered between 8am and 9.30am (though I imagine you would be taking your life in your hands to eat it!)The receptionists were completely unhelpful and only gave a partial refund under extreme duress. I will be calling Trading Standards and Camden Council to report this hotel. It is horrendous and I wouldn't house my dog in it.Beware!!!!"

12,1242,"Jan 21 2008 	Very poor	First of all, the Lonsdale has a good location, in a nice part of London and close to the centre. We stayed for one night after coming down from the Midlands to see a musical in the West End and it was very convenient for that. That, however, is one of the few good things you can say about it. The staff was generally surly and uncommunicative and entirely foreign - some spoke very poor English. The first room we were given had no headboards on the bed and stank of stale cigarette smoke - despite our requesting a non-smoking room. The second room was very hot (radiators on full and no way of turning them down) and the light in the bathroom didn't work. We were assured that this would be fixed, and in all fairness both were fixed quickly. However, although the radiators were off the room remained very warm; it was not a cold night and we had to have the window wide open all night, which made it rather noisy. The furniture and fittings were barely adequate - many items were cracked, old and poorly maintained. The carpets were shabby and frayed. The 'ensuite bathroom' was a cabinet installed in one corner of the room and while clean enough was very cramped; there was hot water, as long as you worked out that the shower had to be turned towards the cold end to get hot! The room wasn't too dirty, but could certainly have been better. The television worked, but wasn't tuned into any stations. Breakfast was adequate (bacon, sausages, fried eggs, toast, orange juice, tea), but kept running out and had to be replenished (slowly) by very surly kitchen staff. There was only one flavour of jam and no sauces at all. All in all, not a particularly pleasant experience and I'm glad we only stayed one night - I certainly wouldn't have stayed any more. 75 per night may be cheap for London, but it is still not exactly cheap and I expect much more for my money. I have stayed in many (much, much cheaper) hostels in major European cities, and I have to say that this 'hotel' was far worse than any of them. Not recommended at all."
13,1242,"Jan 3 2008 	Lonsdale Hotel + Cheaper rates = Horrible Stay	The Lonsdale hotel = horrible accomodation, I am a Soldier and have been deployed numerous times and know what it is like to &quot;rough it&quot;. But the fact is that I paid for this accomodation. The bathrooms were disgusting, asif they were never cleaned, the sink inside the bedroom was horrible, there was a huge clump of hair stuck in the drain with what appeared to be a dead cockroach. When I notified the front desk, they said that they would take care of it, but int the three days I was with them, they never did. To top things off, the receptionist couldn't speak English. She couldn't even give directions from the nearest tube station. God forbid that there are any problems (ie, hair clogged sink) because she won't understand you. I will never stay here again and emplore others not to as well. My advice is to stay in the Kings Cross area and take the tube to your destination."
14,1242,"Dec 8 2007 	too expensive!	We stayed here for 60pounds/night. We booked a double room, but the room had a double and a single, so the room was completely filled up!

Yes, 60pounds for a double room is kind of cheap if I consider it is London, but still, it does not worth paying. Look for other hotels!"

Despite paying for two weeks accommodation, I went home for the weekend to return on the Sunday to find my room had been let out for the Saturday night. Everything I'd left in the room ended up in a plastic bag in reception and the laptop I'd hidden away in the wardrobe was gone.Hotel manager turns up for one hour every day (apparently) but you can never get hold of her. Even the police had trouble getting in touch with her.Stay clear."
17,1242,"Apr 10 2007 	Not that bad after all...	I was a bit worried about the hotel after reading the reviews. BUT its not so badYes its like a hostelso what? We got a twin room for 150 for three nights (during a bank holiday weekend). Its good value considering the location. Far more cheaper than everything else in a central location. The room had all the basics and it was clean. It looked like there was a bit of refurbishment going on around the hotel , so hopefully they will improve the rooms in the near future Do not book this hotel if youre looking for a posh place to impress your girlfriend Book this hotel if you just want a place to crash and if you plan to budget on the accommodation, considering everything else is expensive in London (eg. restaurants, museums, clubs)."
18,1242,"Sep 29 2006 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in...	The staff were surly, rude, unpleasant and unhelpful.The room was dirty, the bathroom tiny and the furniture looked as though it had been bought in a 1950s church jumble sale...actually that's an exageration, no one would have had the nerve to charge money for such a pile of junk! The curtains were dirty and ill-fitting. The towels were very very old. The TV was tiny and only had 3 channels. There was no radio. There was no chair in the room, so the only place to sit was on the bed. The view from the window was over a depressing courtyard that contained a broken washing machine.the breakfast was served by someone even ruder than the receptionist and consisted of greasy burnt sausages, undercooked bacon and congealed fried eggs. I can't tell you about the scrambled eggs, as the dish was empty by the time I got there. The cornflakes were soft, and looked like they had been lying out for some considerable time . The drink on offer was orange squash!Do not stay here, pay a few quid more and get somewhere clean and friendly"
19,1242,"Aug 19 2006	Quirky-chic Lonsdale	This hotel is another shabby, but decent, foreign-run &quot;youth hotel&quot; in London.The staff is very casual, standoffish, and could be considered a bit rude by some.The breakfast is scant, but it's there.The price is average, and the value is decent for the location. 40 pounds a night for a single, that's without any deals or booking ahead.The room itself is kind of cute. There are neon rods that illuminate the corners of the room well. The bed is big enough, the TV and fan are junky, but they work sort of.The bathrooms are not bad."
20,1242,"Jun 2 2006	Not all that bad	I stayed here for one night at the beginning of June. We were in London for a friend's birthday and knowing how expensive London clubs/bars/restaurants are we budgeted on the hotel. The Lonsdale is the cheapest for miles around and has a great location, just near the gorgeous Russel Square, a stone's throw from Euston, Leicester square, Covent Garden and Oxford Street. The staff were neither polite nor rude, they were just quiet. The room was clean and basic, and at 75 for a triple very reasonable. The bathroom was a big disappoinment, more like an aeroplane toilet with a shower added on, and about the size of most people's bath mats. However everything worked, it was clean and reasonably comfortable and cheap. Not recommended if you're trying to impress anyone, but great for students on a budget who want a night out and great shopping more than a hotel."
21,1242,"May 16 2006	Poor hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my wife and Mother during the London Marathon in April. I'm generally not too fussy as long as the place is generally clean and well run. Unfortunately the Lonsdale hotel is neither of these things and I couldnt really recommend it to anyone other than on the grounds that it is relatively cheap and has a good location to Oxford street etc. The carpets are old and frayed, the furniture shoddy, one member of staff serving breakfast and constantly running out of things. It also took a member of staff 10 minutes to open the door of our room because the lock was old. I would have moved to another hotel if we were planning a longer stay and definitely won't be staying again."
22,1242,"Mar 22 2006 	oh my god	this has to be the worst hotel i have ever been to, to say it was smelly and dirty is an understatement! we were booked in for three nights but after one very sleepless night had to leave even though our business check had already cleared, it looks to me as a hostel would look. DO NOT under any circumstances stay here !!!"
23,1242,Feb 13 2006	Do not go here	I have just seen this hotel on a consumer watchdog programme on BBC1.The hotel looks pleasant from the outoside and the rooms basic.A health standards officer carried out checks on the room only to find it brimming with harmful bacterial.Worst part is that a piece of excrement was found on the ceiling of the bathroom.I will leave it there.
24,1242,"May 23 2005	oh my lordie	If y ou don't mind sharing a bathroom or having your own portapotty in your room, well then lonsdale is the place for you. the constant urine smell and dirty towels are an added bonus. the staff is fantastic, charging for phone calls that are local and should be included. but whats even better was the struggle to make a phone call. you have to ask them to use the line which isn't easy because half the time you can't even communicate with them. i think the bed gave me a rash and oh my those rooms aren't spacious at all. every night it sounded like there was a herd of elephants coming down the stairs... whata dumpoverall... i hated it. i expected at LEAST clean towels. if your staying here... bring your own towels."
25,1242,"Feb 28 2005	Expect a basic Bed 	If you want a Hotel stay away. Well, what can I say...a weekend in London planned and we booked in here for two nights. Arrived late on Friday evening to find out that out double en-suite room was in fact a double room, with a shower cubicle within the room and a shared toilet along the corridor. The carpet was terrible - looked like it had been scrateched by a cat, the furniture was very basic and very shabby. The bedspread was threadbare, the decor in desperate need, oh and one towel between two of us. In normal circumstances I would have asked for an additional towel and asked about their understanding of the word 'ensuite', but the shock and horror of seeing the room just overcame us. Things were so bad, we were nervous about taking our shoes off....the only thing we could think was that we wouldn't be staying the two nights that we had paid for....but we were just too tired to do anything about it there and then.On the positive side, the bed linen was very clean and the bed very comfortable, but the moment we woke, we washed and went on the serach of new accomodation....at any price! We skipped breakfast at the 'hotel' and ate in a lovely cafe in Russell Square. After asking around at a few hotels, everywhere seemed fully booked, but one hotel booked us in at a hotel in the City (not really where we wanted to be, but anywhere, anywhere was better than another night at the Lonsdate!!), back to the Lonsdale, collected our bags and ran to the nearest tube station. We felt like two school children running away!!! It was so dire that we didn't even stop to ask for our money back for the second night, the relief of knowing we could stay somewhere else was so enormous!!Once across town, we checked into a fab hotel and immediately showered and changed....Saturday morning all but over, but the rest of the weekend was excellent, however, without a sense of humour and the cash to book somewhere else, it could have been a right disaster!My advice - if you're looking for a Bed and Breakfast that you are willing to pay over the top for, then this is the place, but don't believe what you see when you look at the booking options....I am sure with a lick of paint and some decent furniture this could be an OK place, but if its a cheap hotel you're after you'll get far better value for money at a Travelodge or Travel Inn and at least you know what you're getting."
26,1242,"Feb 11 2005	B Y F A R T H E W O R S T H O T E L I ' V E E V E R B E E N I N	I wish I'd found this web site and read these reviews BEFORE I stopped in this sorry excuse for a Hotel.  But even I had, I probably wouldn't have believed it could be as bad as other reviewers have said. Having stayed there, I now realise they were being kind:  1) The foyer is a bit scruffy. 2) The person who checked us in smelt of . 3) Having already got suspicous, I asked to see the room before I checked in and paid. Unfortunately, I didn't stand my ground, figuring I could always get my money back if it was to awful. DO NOT DO THIS - THEY WILL NOT GIVE A REFUND. 4) As we walked up to the room up the filthy, and I mean FILTHY, carpets the smell of damp increased our foreboding. Mess lay around, cupboard doors standing open etc. Surely the room must be an improvement, we prayed... 5) We were in London for a Valentines weekend, but were given a twin room, having booked a double. First night ruined as they couldn't move us until the next day. 6) Carpet unbelievably dirty. 7) Hot water didn't work propelry. 8) TV remote had no batteries in. 9) Light was broken. 10) Blankets were clean but of really crap quality. 11) Toilet seat was broken off. 12) Furniture looked like it was from a jumble sale, mismatched, cheap and ancient. 13) I refused to eat the breakfast - if a hotel cares this little for the cleanliness of its rooms, what is the kitchen and food going to be like... 14) Asked for my money back the next morning, they refused, I left anyway.   I am now in a quite brilliant hotel called the Crestfield up near Kings Cross - friendly staff, clean rooms, bar AND, TO SHUT THE &quot;WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR X&quot; SQUAD UP, THE CRESTFIELD IS CHEAPER!! There are may hotels in London as cheap of this, NONE are as bad as this one.  Just don't do it, is all I can add."
27,1242,Jan 5 2005 	Think again	This hotel is not worthy of the 3* rating. We changed rooms three times before finding something acceptable. If we hadn't been working in the area we would have checked out on day one. The reception consisted of 'fill in this form and give me your card details' not even hello! The first room had wall paper peeling off the walls - the second room had a gale force draught through the window and no central heating (the radiator was falling off the wall!) Finally we took a room with cupboard doors falling off - cracked sink and a very unsafe electrical socket. The hotel is in a good location - in my opinion pay a bit more and avoid a bad experience.
28,1242,"Jan 4 2005	Avoid the Lonsdale	My husband and I spent our entire time at the Lonsdale trying to get out! The room was generally dirty, the shower trickled (which was good, I suppose, because the drain was so slow it couldn't have drained more than a trickle), and the soap had been used and had hairs imbedded in it. The carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed -- ever. Breakfast was grossly unappetizing. All in all, it was probably the worst place we've ever stayed. The only good thing about it was the location, but even that was marred by the poor woman who appeared to be sleeping on the stoop next door and who yelled obscenities as us every time we walked by. My advice? Avoid the Lonsdale."
29,1242,"Dec 6 2004	tricksters	These people took our money and then bluntly told us we had been moved to its sister hotel, no apology just an order!. The hotel we were moved to was the GRESHAM. Purfect location for Oxford Street, theatres etc if you dont mind living like a rat for the night. Best only stayed at if youre desperate for a room. I think I'll be paying a bit more in future."
30,1242,"Nov 25 2004	Worst Hotel in the World?	I cannot stress quite how awful this place is. If you look you will see that there are many bad reviews about this place. I urge you to read all of these before you make a decision to book a room at the Lonsdale. Colleagues of mine stayed here and listed a catalogue of reasons not to stay: fleas in the beds, decrepid furniture, porta-loo-toilets!, ridiculously poor breakfast, strange smells in the rooms, etc. Furthermore, they were concerned about the other &quot;guests&quot;, who appeared to be treating the place as a doss-house. All in all, this did not add up to a pleasant experience and they only managed a couple of hours sleep. NOT what you want for accommodation."
31,1242,"Oct 15 2004	hotel from hell!!	never have we stayed anywhere like this. I don't know how it has the nerve to call itself a hotel. Dirty, and could someone please tell me where the lounge is to relax and meet up with friends?? I understand that you don't expect the Ritz for 45 per night, but cleanliness and friendly staff must count for something. No breakfast the next morning because the &quot;dining room&quot; was too small to seat everyone and the food was cooked just on an ordinary cooker ie one egg at a time, and the place was full. It is obvious that the owners of this just want to make a profit out of people and are not concerned about their well being."
32,1242,"Oct 13 2004 	It's OK! What do you expect for 40?!	I only came across these reviews after booking the hotel online, and reading these reviews made me want to cancel. But - it was too late, and now I am staying there, I am glad I didn't cancel! The staff are really friendly and helpful, and it isn't the cesspit people are making it out to be.It's what you'd expect for 40 in Central London. A decent sized comfy bed, a kettle, a television, ample storage space. I didn't go for an ensuite, I went for a basic, which still has a sink in the room so you can freshen up if you want to - the shared showers and toilet are clean, and there's plenty of others to use if one is busy.A buffet breakfast is included, you can choose from basic items in an English breakfast - sausage, bacon, eggs, tomato with toast - or there's cornflakes and fruit available. Breakfast is served with tea, coffee or orange juice. The room is QUIET, which is a real blessing, and there's a heater which means you control the temperature of the room. True, the windows don't have locks on, but all rooms are on the first floor and upward, and they're the old fashioned 'lift up' windows which are nigh-on-impossible to get into from the outside and the doors have inside deadlocks. True, the decor isn't amazing, but what did you expect? The Malmaison?If you haven't booked already - don't be put off by the reviews, and maybe take a wander down Bedford Street before deciding where to stay. There are 7 or 8 other B&amp;Bs down the same road and one of them is bound to have vacancies. If you like to have things firmed up in advance, then book into here for one night, then check out the other hotels once you get here. Don't expect the world; if you want something nicer, go and pay more money. If you just want a place to lay your head down at night, or do some reading and writing in the evening, you may just have found your base."
33,1242,Aug 25 2004	Absolute rogues	These rogues are trying to charge a 50 pound cancellation fee for an online booking cancelled more than ONE month prior to the date of arrival! Their cancellation policy says a fee will be charged if a booking is cancelled two days before arrival. If this is the way they run their business they deserve none!
34,1242,"Aug 9 2004	Charming!	The Lonsdale is lovely! The location is very convenient to walking to the underground. When we walked down Bedford Place we'd sing &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; because it was just like &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The room was small, but, for the price, it was nice. The breakfasts were very good. This was a charming place to stay and a great experience."
35,1242,"Jul 29 2004	Be happy - stay away !	Just think of it, plumming that keeps you up all night, breakfest that looks like it have stayed up all night.Use a few pounds more and get a decent hotell !"
36,1242,"Jul 28 2004	For the price ...	I took a party of 21 French adults (all professionals ranging from 27-60years) to this hotel. After having reserved the rooms (for 25pounds a head a night) I read the reviews here and was very worried, I called the hotel to see if I could get the group the better rooms.On arrival we were met by Javid (?) and he was incredibly courteous. I inspected each of the booked 8 rooms whilst the party checked in. The linen was clean, the floors vacuumed. The showers in some rooms were on the small side, the furniture is from the 70's but generally functioned and only one room I was unhappy with was the basement one (I think 27). Each room was cramped, a bed could have been taken to make more space.However, this is CENTRAL LONDON, you get what you pay for - it's a cheap, very cheap hotel and clean. A bit confusing in it's layout with two staircases and endless corridors.The group were VERY impressed with the locality, cleanliness (having been warned) and the breakfast was apparently fantastic. For 25pounds which over 3 nights converted to 100euros for B&amp;B they all agreed that they'd go back to the Lonsdale for a short break despite the crampness of the rooms."
37,1242,"Jul 26 2004	Not good enough for animals fleas	I was horrified that this was classed as a 3*hotel. The room i booked was supposed to be a double bed en-suite. Not enough room to swing a cat. Never in my wildest dreams would have i have ever stayed in a dull, damp smelly pre-war furnished room with an equivelent to a porta loo/sink/shower found on a camp site. If only i had read the reviews before booking on-line. My husband and i had theatre tickets for 7.30pm on the night we arrived, he was at his office in Covent garden all day and i had walked around in the heat and smog of London so a shower was definately needed before leaving for our show.I entered the shower and began washing my hair in cool water slowly it warmed up and up and up until i was scolded, not having been able to turn the cold water on, i wrapped my lathered hair in a towel and called reception to be told that i DID NOT TELL THEM WHEN I ARRIVED BACK THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A SHOWER....since when do you have to inform all and sundry that your going to have a shower. Due to plumbing work in the hotel they did not know when the cold water would be back on. A few minutes after my call to reception the proprieter brought me a bucket of cold water for me to rinse my hair. Did i mention pre-war before?. When my husband returned from work at 6.30pm we still had no cold water. When we arrived back later that evening the porta loo was flooded due to the cold water tap being left partially on...oops. After cleaning up the flood we went to bed having kicked off the smelly old blankets.Breakfast was at 8 am until 9.30am, after a very uncomfortable night we went to breakfast at 8.15am, to find that nothing was left. My husband poored me a coffee which tasted vile and after listening to the girl for 20 mins chatting in the kitchen she eventually arrived with some toast.I asked if more breakfast was on its way to this she rudely said &quot;in a minute&quot;. I could not stand another minute in this place so we left and ate breakfast in a cafe in town. As a British person i am ashamed that tourist from all over the world could be subjected to such conditions in one of our hotels"
38,1242,"Jul 5 2004	Great Little Hotel	Stayed at the Lonsdale with a group of girlfriends and though it was great. Although it does have a few problems (the breakfast wasn't very good and the en-suite was quite compact!!) I thought it was great! It is very near to the heart of London and all the tourist attractions and theatres and was only a 5 minute walk from the tube station. The area where it is situated is also very good with plenty of nice bars and restaurants just around the corner. The lady on reception could not have been nicer and let us leave our bags on the last day after we had checked out, so we did not have to trail them about. I advise you stay here if you are in London for a fun weekend with a group of friends and are not expecting too much (really, what do you expect for 30 a night!!?)"
39,1242,"Jun 12 2004	wouldnt let my dog stay here	What a dump! Just had one night here as a 'break' for me and my wife! an absolute nightmare! A **** room in a **** hotel with **** or no facilities. We booked an ensuite and didnt get one. We booked a double and didnt get one. We wanted a refund for being misled by pics on internet and for not getting what we'd asked for and guess what, we didnt get one! All this rubbish about 'being open minded' and 'dont think like an american when you stay' on a previous review, ..humans shouldnt be allowed to stay here and theres no English character, charm or benefits in staying in a dump, even if the locations good. Keep looking, plenty of good hotels in London"
40,1242,"Apr 13 2004	D E V I L `S P L A C E	All I have read about this so called hotel is not true - this place is worse, it is &quot;The Devil`s Place&quot;: disgusting, horrible, filthy, dirty, ugly, terrible ............. and there is no refund if you will leave earlier. &quot;Mind the flop!&quot;"
41,1242,"Feb 27 2004	5 star dump	Well i wish i had read these reviews before i booked. When i entered the hotel it looked very run down and basic but it wasnt until i had payed in full for my stay and had been showed to my room that the shock had hit home. The room was a dirty ******** it can't have been cleaned for years, It was total mish mash of old tacky furniture that had been painted and was falling apart, I can't belive how this hotel meets heath and saftey regulations!! with its smell,dodgy lighting and the poor washroom faciltys.DON'T STAY AT THE LONSDALE HOEL"
42,1242,"Feb 26 2004	Can't think like an American	Ok call me insane but I've actually stayed at this hotel a total of 3 times. Hey it was cheap it was the exact location I wanted to be in and I was going with a couple of girlfriends to drink and go clubbing. What did we care if the room was small? First of all go with ensuite facilities only!!! Granted they are the smallest bathrooms (the term watercloset could not be more appropriate) I have ever seen in my life. One must make a decision on which direction you need to face prior to closing the door as you can literally not turn around once inside. I stayed there one summer when the temps were in the 90's and for London that's hot, the heat in the hotel was still going full blast however. Apparently it was either heat or no hot water.... All in all it does not even equal the level of a Motel 66 in the States, still it is cheap and if you are looking to be close to the clubs and nightlife of Soho it's crawling distance."
43,1242,"Feb 16 2004	It IS that bad	Do not listen to those that say &quot;it isn't so bad&quot; - IT IS!! Me and my boyfriend booked the Lonsdale over the internet (sadly before we had seen this site) for a romantic Valentines weekend. On arrival, we were told that we could not have our booked room (double ensuite) and were instead given a tiny room with three single beds shoved in, and little else. Oh, a TV on a rickety table. Of course the TV didn't actually work. And the toilets were down the hall. The walls and furniture are more than just &quot;mismatched&quot; as someone has generously stated, they were downright dirty. We were not looking for a fancy hotel, but expected to get what we had booked and expected it to at least be clean! It is so far from the description and pictures on the website that it should be reported to Trading Standards. Like so many others, we were made to pay a cancellation fee of one night, but we stayed for neither of the nights we booked. Luckily we found somewhere else to stay (next door!) and didn't let it ruin our weekend. We would never recommend this 'hotel' to anyone, and as for it being a &quot;uniquely European experince&quot;, there is nothing European about a dirty shabby run-down little dump with a funny smell."

1,1250,"Nov 26 2009 	Do you want a drink? maybe now? maybe now? or now?	I was in this hotel last week and had a very nice stay. The hotel is very modern and the service was to be proud of.Good points- was checked in by a very nice irish chap in the reception, big smile and good service- I had acess to a kind of business centre and done some work from there.Bad Points- I couldnt seat at the lounge without been asked every 5 minutes if I wanted a drink- the street in front gets very dark on the night time"
2,1250,"Nov 24 2009 	Above and beyond - WOW	I booked a double room at the Montcalm, knowing that I would be proposing to my girlfriend that afternoon in London, before checking into the hotel. I was traveling to London earlier in the week for business, but had a break and stopped by the hotel. I talked to the GM and asked what I could do to make my engagement night special. They arranged champagne and flowers for the room, and said that they would look into a room upgrade. Not only did they come through with the chamagne and flowers, they upgraded me to the WOW suite. This was unreal. Two rooms, canopy bed, huge bathroom, couch, two flat screen tv's...the works. I was shocked, as was my fiance. I don't know how I will top it for my honeymoon. The next day we ran into the GM, who asked about the ring and details on the proposal. She was as excited about our engagement as we were. Thanks and Cheers to the Montcalm for an unforgettable experience."
3,1250,"Nov 20 2009 	brand new-great staff-perfect location	we stayed mid November, 4 nights, with our 3 yo son. Although we checked earlier than 14:00 they gave us a room immediately. there was a little problem with the elevators, not working properly, but they are so high tech and they fixed it within the day, so no prob. Our portman double room was spacious, nice and with an equally nice bathroom, large enough for London's standards and the shower was one of a kind. they even provided us with babycot, when we asked for it.What i liked most was that everything was perfectly clean and all things brand new! (towels, bathrobes,carpet etc). the safe is large enough to put your laptop in and also has a charger in it, to charge it while away. in the closet you will find iron, ironboard and umbrella. there are USB sockets to charge your iphone/ipod. The staff is great, professional, very friendy and attentive ,especially the people at the resto and the doormen. the breakfast is of top quality as well as lunch and dinner we had at vetro restaurant. Many thanks to Rachelle, Roberto, Alex.The location is ideal, at top of park lane, few steps from oxford street, marble arch, hyde park with tube right at the corner.I agree with Ronnie28, their website looks very nice but difficult to navigate. though i made the reservation through internet, didn't manage to book the package i wanted and the reception didn't notice i had booked room breakfast included, i mentioned it after the first breakfast and then they noticed it, but took care of it and made the amendment, so, it was fine with me"

After trying to fix and making us late for meeting friends we were advised to move rooms which we did at 11.30 pm.The safe in the new room worked.However the rain shower in the new room 115 is not fitted correctly and sprays water everywhere around the bathroom. The hotel sent maintenance to fix, but the problem did not go away. Otherwise the hotel is fantastic and the staff also excellent, doors opened for you etc.But for 5 star and 5 star prices everything should work, however we would stay again, but check the safe and shower works correctlt"

We arrived early in the morning, although check in was at 2pm, therefore our room was not ready, but we were given a room to stay in until then. Our club room was spacious, nice and with an equally nice bathroom. They have a nice small gym and spa etc. The hotel staff were very polite and professional- not friendly , but then again who is- in London! They are not unfriendly either-just professional which was fine by me.The only snag which was major for me.....was, there does not seem to be any alignment between their website and the hotel staff. I had booked on line with breakfast inclusive, yet, I practically had to explain every morning that I had paid for breakfast! Until the minute I checked out. At over 200pounds per night, I found this extremely annoying. Although they apologised and decided not to charge me for the spa treatment to make up for this(which was nice of them), it still somehow affected my opinion of an otherwise great hotel. Internet was free, therefore very unstable......you know what they say about freebies...."
7,1250,"Oct 26 2009 	Amazingly luxurious hotel	My wife and i have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Montcalm, and all i can say is you HAVE to stay here. It has done undergone a massive refurbishment, and is finished to an extremely high top end standard.It was our anniversary, and upon checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded several rooms to the Mayfair suite, and wow, it is huge, with a bed that would sleep 6 adults (if you are so inclined), a seperate lounge area, and 2 bathrooms. The main bathrooms have a glass panel wall, so you can see from the bedroom into the bathroom (it did have an automatic blind, for the more reserved of guests), but hey it was our anniversary !We only had chance to use hotel restaurant for breakfast, as we had made reservations elsewhere for lunch and evening meals, but the breakfasts where very good with plenty of choice, and very attentive staff.Every single member of staff at the hotel made us feel very special, from the doormen to the maids, they simply could not do enough for us.We didn't get a chance to use the facilities in the spa area, but the pool and jacuzzi looked amazing.The area that the hotel is situated in is a very nice quiet crescent road, literally 2 minutes walk from marbel arch and oxford street, so is very well placed for shopping down oxford street and regent street.To sumarise, i have to say this is the best hotel i have aver stayed in, and it is worthy of every one of it's five stars, i would give it more if that were possible ! Stay here, i promise you will not regret it !"
8,1250,"Oct 15 2009 	Stunning!	I cannot convey in words how stunning this hotel is. I suggest look at their website for pictures of their rooms and the hotel itself, these pictures are 100% accurate. The hotel is stunning! Very modern fixtures and fittings befitting a true 5 star. I was particularly impressed by the lighting in the hotel which generated such a warm and elegant atmosphere. We were received into the hotel with such professionalism. The staff were the best I have ever come across and made our stay! They were friendly, kind and all were smiling, which added to the wonderful atmosphere. The location is a two minute walk from marble arch tube station in a safe, well lit and busy area. Also Oxford street is around the corner so you are right in the heart of London. I wish I could have stayed longer to avail of the amenities. Many thanks to the team at the hotel for an unforgettable experience. We will be back for sure!!!!!!"
9,1250,"Sep 28 2009 	Fabulous and new	The Montcalm is beautifully refurbished to a very high standard, very contemporary and great quality bathrooms. Bed and linen divine!! Great TV in the room. The staff were superb and extremely helpful. The spa is not yet finished, but they gave us a complimentary head massage at a spa on the same road which was lovely. The bar and reception are immaculate.We didn't take breakfast here, at 28 a head it is WAY over priced, there is a place round the corner which does a great eggs benedict for 7......We would defiantely stay again. Very quiet street, and very handy for the tube or a walk in Hyde Park"
10,1250,"Sep 21 2009 	Enjoyable Stay	When we arrived the hotel was still under construction which was a little annoying, in particular the pool was unfinished and there was a lot of construction going on and for the first 2 days we felt like the only people in the hotel. We experianced a few teething issues in our room, however we still really enjoyed this hotel, the meal in the restaurant was really nice (a bit odd being the only people there) and the bathroom was fanstastic. The room was confortable but a little small. Staff were very helpful and the decor is very trendy and after a few days people started arriving and the construction noise stopped. The location is excellent for tourists or business travellers"
11,1250,"Sep 20 2009 	Chic west end hotel with a touch of malmaison	When we stayed at the Montcalm it had only been open for two weeks. Nothing let the place down as far as we were concerned. It is a chic, modern experience, very similar to a malmaison. The staff were brilliant. The room fixtures and fittings look top quality and should pass the test of time. 32&quot; flat screen samsung in the bedroom and a smaller waterproof one in the bathroom. And what a shower!! The location is great for shopping, restaurants, etc, yet not in the heart of the hustle bustle."
12,1250,"Sep 12 2009 	Beautiful hotel 5****	This hotel is 5* with 5* customer service. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London and wanting to be close to Oxford st for shopping as it is a 5 minute walk. I have stayed in many hotels in Mayfair, and this hotel is by far the best hotel I have stayed in, our room was absolutly gorgeous, with a tv in the bathroom, big fuffy pillows and a comfy bed, we had a problem with our TV and the technician was with us in a matter of minutes to try and resolve the problem. We loved this hotel that much that we will be returning in a few weeks on business! Brilliant!!!!!"

1,1251,Oct 20 2009 	low price hotel	near Camberwell Green - well connected with Oval station - near ethnic restaurants and local shops.
2,1251,Jun 2 2009 	One look at room and walked out.	Could not stay there. Bathroom had mould growing up wall. Stains on bedside table. Broken light fitting hanging inches over bed. Checked out immeadiately but they still tried to charge even though did not stay. Had to do a chargeback via bank.
3,1251,"Apr 28 2008 	Friendly - clean - tidy - no probs	i booked this hotel as its website says a 10 min walk to the tube station. Don't be fooled it is more like a 20 min walk so i would advise you to get the bus 36 or 436 goes straight to it from oval tube station. the area can be quite intimidating and noisy with traffic the hotel itself does not look like much from the front but once you walk through the door its fine. I found both the lady and young gentleman on the front desk to be very friendly and pleasant. We were on the 3rd floor - no lift - and it is quite a lot of stairs to the 3rd floor but once in the room it had a very warm welcolming smell (air freshner but nice), the room had everything you would need, tv, window with view of london, shower etc. We were there for 2 nights and the towels were changed on the 2nd day which is unusual but nice. Breakfast was in the restaurant section and was the basic cereal, toast, juice but what more do you need for 60 a night i think this is a bargain! I would def stay here again."
4,1251,"Mar 26 2008 	Awfull!!! Stay Away!!!	We booked our stay here on hostelworld.com . They charged us with booking fee and deposit. And guess what? YES, when we arrived at this magnificant hotel we had NO reservation, NO place to stay. So, another money, change of our departure dates from london with national express, etc. Very bad experience! I advise you to stay away from The New Dome hotel, as well as reservating online with hostelworld.com!!!"
5,1251,"Jun 26 2007 	Not the best place in the world?	Well were do I start...from the moment I walked in I knew it was wrong. Basically The New Dome is an indian restaurant with rooms, its well in need of a renovation and a clean. The lady on reception wasnt too welcoming and we were directed to our rooms by her pointing at a door way. The rooms were small and dirty. The walls were in dia need of a repaint, the toilet looked like a public one in the middle of a park and the carpets looked like they had so much wild life in them I could ring David Attenborough. The sheets looked like they may not have been changed and I didnt feel alone in bed. This being the rooms I didnt arrive for breakfast . Am sorry but am not in the habit of writing bad reviews, I would rather just not write one if am not pleased, but people need to be aware of The New Dome, if your really desperate then go for it, but If I wasnt with my daughter I would have slept rough. Overall I would never set foot in here again."
6,1251,"Nov 13 2006	Discrace	Terrible Service, Wouldnt give breakfast at 9:45am and said it was on till 10:00am, Rat Catcher in room, Discrace for a 70 per night hotel as there are 30 hotels which are miles better when down there. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
7,1251,May 27 2006 	Stay in your car instead	This hotel is best avoided. Everywhere has a worn out look and feel to it. My room had a double bed in it but was really only big enough to be a single. There was about 6 inches between the foot of the bed and a very poorly wardrobe that was ready to fall over. There was no evidence of a smoke/fire alarm system throughout the building that I could see.Some people seem to be in and out of this hotel very quickly and perhaps more than once a day.There is nowhere to park except in the streets nearby. These are free but you can end up a long way from the hotel. It's a gamble whether your car will still be intact when you return to it.
8,1251,"Mar 16 2006 	Need new mattresses and bedding	Carpets, paintwork and fixtures all very worn and not too clean. My mattress consisted of a grid of one-inch diameter springs covered with what felt like a single sheet. Had to sleep on top of the duvet as the springs hurt too much - with only the bedspread for cover. The bedspread had SIX cigarette burns or possibly moth holes in it. Laundered and clean, but really 'not nice'.If it wasn't for the state of the mattress and bedspread it would be fine for the price, but it's just not."
9,1251,"Dec 11 2005	Customer service??? Whats that?	Would not use this hotel for my dogs. Upon arriving they had no record of a booking made over 4 weeks in advance and claimed no payment had been made. Would only acknowledge they had received payment on day 3 of our stay after I had phoned the credit card company. Had to spend 2 nights on a bed with a metal spring poking through the mattress then arrived back on night 3 to find the room had been flooded from above no attempt had been made to protect our belongings and our towels had been laid on the bed and floor to help soak some of the water up. We were then left to move all our things to another room one floor down, received no apology and were only provided with the standard one towel per person. No reduction was made for the cost of our stay following the inconvenience. The rooms dont smell to pleasant and bathrooms are not cleaned to much of a standard between guests, the carpets are extremely overdue replacement or at least a shampoo."
10,1251,"Nov 19 2005	Hmm not so good	Stayed here for 5 days for a course in Kings College. Lights didnt work in room, so was moved the next day. Breakfast was not so good (cornflake dust from bottom of box, very grumpy woman who provided coffee on 3/5 days).Room and bathroom just about clean. Position good for the college, but that was about it.Note no tube stations nearby. I kept out of the hotel apart from sleeping! It would do for a functional stay, as price OK, but i would not come here for pleasure-I were visting London I would stay elsewhere."
11,1251,Oct 14 2008 	Me parecio bsico pero tenia de todo (buena calidad-precio)
1,1254,"Oct 10 2009 	A good base for London sightseeing	Located a short walk from Paddington Underground &amp; Railway Station, the Omega Hotel is a good base for London sightseeing. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. Breakfast (incl in the rate) adequate. Helpful staff."
2,1254,"Apr 28 2009	Worse hotel we've stayed at!!	OMEGA HOTEL HYDE PARK. Small hotel, chosen because it had car parking facilities and close to St. Mary's Hospital.Pokey little room, with en suite in corner. No Bath, just WC sink and shower. Noisy extractor fan. Bed very uncomfortable. Could feel springs digging in back. No tea making facilities. No hairdrier. No lift. Only good think about our stay was that we only had to stay one night. Staff were friendly."
3,1254,"Oct 25 2008 	Basic clean functional and friendly service - oh and everything works...	I stayed here for two nights because of its relatively low rates and proximity to Paddington, to get me into Heathrow quickly. I write his review bearing in mind the cost and quality of other hotels in London.Sussex Gardens is located about a 5-minute walk from Paddington Station and is easy to find. The guy at reception was very friendly and dealt with check-in smoothly. Note you have to pay the bill upon check-in.I was on a high floor and there is no lift, which is common in these period buildings. Note that the stairs are narrow and steep. Again this is common with buildings of this type. I had a single room and it was tiny. Apart from the single bed there was not much space for anything else except for a small desk, with a 14 inch TV with freeview channes, a tiny slot in shower/toilet/sink cubicle and a small wardrobe. The room however was clean and quiet. The bed, in which I slept vey well, was comfy, and sheets replaced every day. The ensuite cubicle really is tiny but at least the room has one. In London, for this price, showers and toilets are normally shared. The shower is so small about a third of my body protruded out past the shower curtain, and I am not fat! The toilet is almost adjacent to the shower as is the sink. However, though the water pressure is a little low, it all worked and there is constant hot water. There is one (1) small towel and you get two tiny bars of soap and a tumbler. The tumbler was dirty with toothpaste on the bottom.The TV though small had most Freeview channels which was good. There was a rather large fly and wasp that I killed in the room but only because the window was wide open when I got into the room. Breakfast is quite nice. Again, much better than the usual fare one would get in hotels in this category. In the basement there's a cosy and decent sized dining room with an adjacent kitchen with a couple of friendly and welcoming female cooks. You can help youself to cereas, juices and fresh coffee. Plus a whole rack of toast each and an Ebglish breakfast (which comprised two fried eggs, two bacon, about 20 beans and a tinned tomato). It was filling, tasted good and was served up by the ladies with a smile.Check-out is simply a case of leaving your key card on reception. No fuss whatsoever (there are no mini-bars, restaurants etc at this type of hotel).From Paddington Station you can easily get into the West End (Bakerloo Line) or other places in London. Hyde Park is not far away at all.In summary, though the rooms are small and basic, everything works, the place is clean, comfortable and the service is friendly. For that reason I recommend this place for those on a budget."
4,1254,"Jul 15 2008 	Omega Hotel - good value accommodation	This is a small hotel in a good location - close to Paddington station and short walk to city centre. Our room was small but very clean and there was adequate storage for a short break. The bathroom was tiny but again, spotlessly clean, and the shower was always hot. Good English breakfast, and friendly, helpful staff. Only criticism is having to climb steep stairs, but overall good value for money, and would definitely stay there again."
5,1254,"Jul 12 2007	Avoid Omega Hotel	This hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in. I am writing to complain big time about this hotel. We had a terrible experience in this hole of a hotel. The beds were miserably uncomfortable, the pillows were like rocks and when someone came into the neighboring rooms, it sounded like they were entering ours. On top of all that, the manager was the most miserable, rude, nasty, inhospitable person I have ever come across in the hospitality industry. He turned it into the inhospitality industry. When I inquired about charges for local phone calls, not only didn't he give me a straight answer, he hung up on me! Unbelievable. Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel and warn your friends."
6,1254,"May 16 2007 	Very Quaint and Affordable Hotel	Arrived in this quaint hotel June 2006 for 3 day stay. We found the staff most accommodating and friendly. The manager very easy to chat to and get information about London.The Hotel was in a great location for access to the underground and Hyde Park and there are a number of tourist attractions within a reasonable walking distance of this Hotel. (Lords, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, Mayfair and Parklane and Sherlock Holmes Museum to name a few)The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was more than adequate. We spent most of our time walking and catching trains and buses during the day on this trip so we just wanted a nice clean and affordable place to set down at night.I would recommend this place to anyone else.I guess anybody can have at least one bad tale to tell but this certainly was one of the better hotels we stayed in during our european vacation."
7,1254,"Apr 8 2007 	Basic but clean and close to Paddington Station	I was looking for a hotel for one night close to Paddington so I could get the Heathrow Express early in the morning. It is in Sussex Gardens which is full of such places, but it had the best room rate I could find (59 inc breakfast). First impressions were a bit iffy - reception is a small basic room inside the front door, but I was efficiently checked in and had a room on the first floor with a double bed, wardrobe and a very small shower room. Take your own soap/shampoo as there is not any provided. But the towel was good and large, the bed firm and everything very clean.Breakfast in the basement was quick and unexpectedly good - full English (despite website saying continental) with juices/cereals/ bacon-egg etc.Check out was immediate as payment taken by card the previous evening.The Omega is a relatively (for London) cheap option for a short stay. Paddington Station is less than 5 minutes walk away. It does the job I wanted of it."
8,1254,"Aug 24 2006	Perfectly located pleasant budget B	My son and I stayed in a twin room for two nights. Although we were quite surprised at the small size of the room, we realise that this is quite common for a city B&amp;B. And although the bathrooms were small 'pods' in the corner of each room, there was everything in it that we needed. The room was clean, and fresh, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly. The cooked breakfasts went down very well with my son who now expects eggs &amp; bacon every morning. The only thing that put me off a little was the strong smell of bacon coming into my room at 7am (but then I'm a vegetarian so I'm sure most people would welcome it). Overall good value for money, in an absolutely perfect location for Paddington main station and the tube, one stop via tube to Bayswaters Whiteley Centre (and cinema), and Kensington Park is only a 5 minute walk away. Would use it again."
9,1254,"Aug 17 2006	Don't go there!	Don't even think about booking a room here. I did, arrived to check in with my booking reference number and was told by the totally unapologetic or sympathetic immigrant manning the desk that there was no room booked for me, or one available, i.e. tough[---] Two hours later they sent a cancellation email to my home address (60 miles away!).I've not heard a dicky bird of an apology or explanation for the situation. Avoid!!"
10,1254,"Jul 31 2006	Basic but sufficient (sort of)	We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. Overall I'd say the hotel was not worth the money, as you can surely find cheaper and more worthwhile budget accommodation in the same area. On previous occasions I have stayed in nearby hotels that were more pleasing and less expensive. Granted, a budget hotel in central London serves a very specific purpose: a place to sleep and shower. This hotel served that function very well. We slept comfortably and had a fully-functioning shower. Luckily, we are not picky hotel guests, otherwise we would've been quite dissatisfied with the overall value for money spent. For example, we (like previous reviewers) received only one towel, and the glasses in the bathroom were disgustingly dirty. They were not replaced during our visit. I'd like to know if they were replaced at all when we left. The hotel staff were very friendly and the location is ideal for exploring the city. Doubt I'd stay here again, but I have no major complaints."
11,1254,"Jul 18 2006	Not Good	We were put on a 1 persons bedroom (each day there was only 1 towel and the maid was surprised there were 2 poeple on the room because it was only used for 1 person)with 2 persons at the front. We requested a room at the back. Breakfast is horrible (for the english one, continental is non existent). All springs in the bed can be felt when lying down."
12,1254,"Mar 14 2006	Small but lovely and great staff	8 of us - 4 couples - stayed in the Omega, for 3 nights. The hotel and staircase was small, well everything was small, but nice. For 3 nights it was more than enough. The bathroom was clean, but I felt myself in a motorhome. The staff and the receptionist was great, helped in everything - also showed a place near the hotel where we could drink some more beer after 11p.m. ;) The breakfast was same every morning, typical English breakfast, but it was tasty, and we liked it.Altogether we enjoyed our stay, and had a great time."
13,1254,"Sep 21 2005	No good experience	I stayed there one week in September 2005. Some comments:1) People who want to book directly at the hotel and not via an internetsite where price and modalities of payment are clear, should be aware that in the information leaflet of the hotel ist written:&quot;Credit and Debit cards are accepted but please note that there is a 5% service charge on all payments.&quot;2) Breakfast-time is 7:30-9:00 weekdays and 8:00-9:00 sundays.3) Breakfast is substandard for an english breakfast: a choice of cerals, milk, orange juice, tea or coffee, 2 toasts, 35 white beans in tomato sauce, 2 slices of bacon, 1 peeled tomato, 1 egg. When a guest asked shyly for grapefruit juice, the answer was: No grapefruit juice.4) The bed-linen was never changed during the week I stayed at the hotel.5) Since they have key cards, do not expect anybody at the reception in the morning before 8:00."
14,1254,"Aug 4 2005	Small but nice	Really nice place with extraordinary friendly staff at the reception desk all the 24 hours. It is a small hotel with small rooms and even smaller bathrooms, but everything needed is there anyway. Our room was clean and quiet with a nice view and fine beds. The breakfast is english but with a lot of cereal , cornflakes and stuff - that is no one has to go starving into the steeets of London. No good for people who have problems with stairs."
15,1254,"May 28 2005	Good Value Hotel	This is a good value hotel. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms are adequate. The only drawback was that there is no lift - so be prepared to climb many steps possibly with luggage. Again, for the price is is a good value."
16,1254,"Oct 23 2004	No complaints	We stayed 3 nights at the Omega and found the staff to be friendly and professional. The room was small and yes the bathrooms are tiny - but the hotels on sussex gardens were not built to be hotels.The breakfast was good, but for some reason no sausages were served! The hotel is clean, warm and in a good location. I'd stay again if I needed a budget place to crash while in London.Overall it's not a bad place."
17,1254,"Sep 18 2004	Excellent location 	We just spent two nights at the Omega. The location is wonderful - close to everything. The staff was outstanding, very helpful and friendly. The breakfast was very good, hot and prepared very quickly. But the room was just too small. And the bathroom really does remind one of an airplane.My husband and I realize European hotel rooms are normally smaller. But this was the smallest room we have ever experienced in all the years we've traveled. We were also disappointed we were not given fresh towels but instead found them draped over our bed to dry. We spent our days and evenings touring London, checking out local pubs and enjoying the tube system. As I said, the hotel is in a wonderful location and the staff was very helpful. So if being crowded doesn't bother you - it's a suitable place to stay."
18,1254,"Jul 16 2004	disappointing	My son and I just returned from our trip from Europe. We spent 8 nights at the Omega. The location was great and the breakfasts were made to order. The woman preparing the meal was overworked!! Only ONE towel was provided for each of us, each day. One day they took the ones off of the floor of the washroom and wanted us to use them again!! No face clothes provided. It was difficult to wash your face in the sink, because of the glass ledge over the sink. The washroom itself felt like you were in an airplane, it was very small and difficult to take a shower because of lack of space. It also felt like you were moving. You really have to experience it for yourself. To top it off, I ended up with bed bug bites!!! I told the owner and he said &quot; I guess I'll have to fumigate it when you leave.&quot; We would have found a different hotel, but I had unfortuately paid up front. Also, there was only one small mirror in the room itself, and only one outlet!!! Makes it difficult when you want to dry and straighten your hair at the same time. Definitely not worth the money spent. It was 65 pounds a night. Fortunately we did not spend a lot of time in the room, we had too much fun exploring the beautiful city of London."

1,1258,"TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE OLD TIRED ROOMS 5* NO WAY	Extremely expensive considering the state it is in. The public areas were beautiful, however the rooms are terrible. I had stayed two nights previously at Harrington Hall (4*) which was far better and half the price. The rooms are in need of total renovation. There were no tea and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was very poor with no shower gel and the shower was just an attachement from the taps and therefore could not stand under it. The corridors were extremely noisy as well. Great location."
2,1258,"Lovely building great location beware of ""extras""	First qualifier: I stayed on Starwood points. This is a lovely hotel in a great location - if you are a walker or runner, Green Park, Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens are at your doorstep. Also an easy walk to the Underground and to the West End theaters. There is a beautiful area serving tea during the day and drinks at night. A grand space. You pay for the privilege. My one gripe about the layout of the hotel is that there is nowhere to lounge or sit in the lobby. The health club is nice - nothing special but certainly adequate.This is an older building, so room type and sizes vary. The rooms are clean and spacious - for London - and nicely appointed. The bathroom was especially nice. Service is good, not great - I found the level of concierge service to be unpredictable. The one thing My one qualifier is that the &quot;extras&quot; are really overpriced. An OK, but certainly not great breakfast in the restaurant is 23 pounds (that's $40 at today's exchange rates). But Starbucks is down the street and so is a Marks&amp; Spencer where wonderful pastries can be bought for less than a pound. Also, Internet Access is 18 pounds per night - a huge ripoff. For a nearly $500/night hotel, breakfast and Internet access should not have to cost $75 more."
3,1258,"excellent service	just stayed for three nights in this great period hotel the service given by all the staff was excellent !!! i have stayed at many london hotels over the past twenty years and would have no problem recomending this ,the breakfast was one of the best in london !! ,the bed was heavenly and wanted to take it home and the staff very helpful so in all ive had a very happy time"
4,1258,Nov 26 2009 	Needs refurbishing badly	I stayed here for one night and was so disappointed. The common areas of the hotel are gorgeous - the palm court area and the ballroom. The standard rooms though are really bad and in need of total renovation. Everything is old fashioned and scruffy. The rooms feel very oppressive and depressing and the corridors more so.If you are looking for 4/5 star - don't stay here as you will be disappointed.
5,1258,"Nov 25 2009 	Edwardian grandeur	A magnificent hotel, still oozing turn of the century decor and atmosphere, the staff were also lovely. The Palm Court was delightful, and the breakfasts were wonderfully extensive. It's location was fantastic, on the edge of historic Mayfair. Buckingham Palace was a brief walk from the hotel across Green Park. Absolutely recommend a stay."
6,1258,"Nov 23 2009 	Dingy smelly and very tired. Horrible.	I very rarely leave feedback on the hotels I stay in and, when I do, it is to praise a hotel. However, as I sit here in my dingy, smelly room, here is an exception. Could a hotelier out there please confirm that, if you book last minute like I had to do today, does the hotel intentionally give you the dirty broom cupboard eventhough the hotel is only half full and there are undoubtedly plenty of better rooms available? I rarely book through last minute sites but it is if you are treated like a social leper when you do. This hotel could be beautiful with a makeover but a prison cell bathroom with broken light bulbs, peeling paint, broken shower and a bedroom with a broken radiator that is substituted by a monstrous portable heater that blocked the desk and seat area and furniture that I would feel ashamed of my great grandparents owning, mean that I wish I was anywhere but here. I stay in a lot of Sheraton / Starwood hotels and, to be fair, they are never like this. Plus points? Good bed as per normal, good location with some great little restaurants nearby."
7,1258,"Nov 22 2009 	Do not stay at this hotel unless you can afford one of the best rooms	I booked this hotel through lastminute.com's Top Secret Hotel facility.Do not do this. Check out where you want to stay properly on Trip Advisor.The standard of room I was allocated at The Park Lane was terrible, the bed and tv may have been five star but the rest, from the rusty soap dish to the hissing cistern to the grubby carpet, was about 1 star.They moved me to a great room because I made a fuss, but had I known where I was staying first I would not have booked."
8,1258,"Nov 21 2009 	Good location hotel needs A LOT of work	I've stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions, some on extended stays for 7-10 nights. The hotel is in dire need of renovation - the rooms definitely show their age, and you can get stuck in a tiny dingy room - which can be a nightmare. Also a shame that you don't get any recognition of SPG status (I'm Platinum) beyond the initial &quot;thank you&quot; gift. Would be great if they offered atleast free breakfast. I would probably stay here again if my other options in London aren't available, but this wouldn't be my first pick."
9,1258,"Nov 17 2009 	excellent location amazing suite	i booked this hotel using my SPG points/cash option for a night at the theatre for my wifes bday, i then took out the suite upgrade offer, all was looking good until i read the reviews on here! I need not have worried, the room was superb with a real penthouse feel, one of the best showers i have ever taken and amazing views over the London skyline, the staff were all polite and did there upmost to help with any questions we had.I don't know if this a reflection of all rooms but ours was first class, in fact all rooms on floor 7 semmed to be of a similar standard.For location and quality this hotel would be hard to beat.Add to this the beautiful breakfast, and we had a memorable stay."
10,1258,Nov 16 2009 	Disappointed	Stayed here for 1 night as attending a dinner in the hotel's ballroom. Rooms are large but very dated. Needs upgrading.Tiles in bathroom need renewing. Had to hold shower as it is not fitted......5* ????No tea/coffee making facilities - went to ask at reception for these and was still waiting 1 hour 20 mins later. No iron and only 1 bathrobe for a twin room?Nice Hilton hotel round the corner - would stay there the next time
11,1258,"Nov 13 2009 	Don't believe what everybody says!!!!!!!	I stayed in The Park Lane Hotel with 3 friends early November for a short break, we booked through 'Show &amp; Stay' . I must say I was a bit wary due to the reviews but having previous experience of poor reviews only to find hotels excellent we weren't put off. This hotel is very grand and 'traditional', Our rooms (431 &amp;432) were immaculate, no evidence of damp, poor furniture or shabby furnishing! The beds were exceptional, the room itself big enough, large TV, mini bar (unopened!). Breakfast was excellent with attentive, but not overbearing, staff. All the staff in the hotel were excellent, tea tray within 5 mins, A/C unit 5 mins and shower repair within 5 mins!! Conscierge very helpfull on check out day. Didn't eat at any other times as we had a tight schedule. The location is the main winner of this hotel, across from Green Park, a stroll to the underground and Buckingham palace. The only disappointment was the bathroom, the shower curtain didn't fit properly &amp; shower head broken, which resulted in wet bathroom, quickly rectified but the bathrooms could really do with an upgrade!!!"
12,1258,"Nov 2 2009 	Great Location Hotel is Old Fashioned	My partner and I stayed at the hotel on 31st October for one night and I will try to give a really honest and balanced review. We booked through Lastminute.com 'Top Secret' and paid 119 RO. On arrival at the hotel we walked through the front door which leads into an impressive and traditional hallway. We then walked through the Palm Court which is used for Afternoon Tea and it was gorgeous but again very traditional with big sofas and lots of high ceilings and gilt. The reception is through to the back however we were dealt with quickly and efficiently and because of the reviews on Trip Advisor I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival, so upon checking in we were given an upgrade to an Executive Room. We arrived in our room and granted it was not 5* - more like 4* - I certainly wouldn't say 2* like some of the other reviews. It was a bit shabby on the paint work and furniture however we had a huge bed with a feather quilt and pillows. The bathroom was clean and the shower enclosure was huge. We were at the front of the hotel over looking Green Park, right on Piccadilly - the view was lovely into the park with all the Autumn leaves and we could see over the tops of the trees to the Eye and Big Ben and Westminster - which with a full moon as well looked positively beautiful in the evening all lit up. We didn't eat in the hotel at all so I can't comment on that but when coming through the Palm Court the afternoon tea looked lovely!The location is fantastic and if you turn left out of the back of the hotel and walk up the street there was a few nice resturants and pubs near by - away from the hustle and bustle of Piccaddilly.If you want a contemporary, pure luxury, first class hotel on Piccadilly then you need to pay the massive price tag at somewhere like The Wolsley or The Ritz - if you are more relaxed about your accomodation and choose the see the positives of a place and it's surroundings then I think it would be fine for a short stay.I can't really fault the hotel - yes it's very traditional and would benefit from a bit of a refurb however the location is fantastic, the staff were friendly and the place was clean - l have used Lastminute.com 'top secret' many times and mainly had really good experiences even in London - but I think it's just the luck of the draw - I think if you are booking top secret then you need to sometimes be prepared for it not to be as great as you hoped it would - I still think in London and this area it was good value for money."
13,1258,"Nov 1 2009 	The worst hotel I have ever stayed in	The most dissapointing experiencr ever, booked through last minute.com top secret, no wonder it was secret that is probably the only way they can get people to stay here. Just vile and dated decor, musty old fashioned rooms, virtually no soundproofing, was meant to spend the day shopping in London today had to come home as so tired having had no sleep as the noisy American in the room next door kept me up and I heard every door slam on the entire floor. Close it and bulldoze it now. You have been warned, this place is a rip off."
14,1258,"Oct 30 2009 	Top class hotel	would highly reccomend this hotel, staff very pleasant and helpful, cleanliness first class, would go back again"
15,1258,Oct 30 2009	Five star service!	I booked a room at this hotel for my father and his partner. Although I did not stay there myself I felt the service I received prior to their arrival was worth reviewing. I contacted the hotel to let them know the booking was for a special occasion and the service I had was outstanding. The manager was very approachable and was more than happy to assist me with my requests. In fact he went out of his way to make sure their stay was an incredibly memorable one.For the level of service I received I would happily stay at this hotel and recommend it to others.
16,1258,"Oct 29 2009 	Dreadful - 2 star at best	Checked in after midnight following a long haul flight. Room was noisey as on level 1 and all the A/C units were outside the window. Decor was shabby, furniture was old and room facilities were non-existent. Room did not even have a mini-bar so called down to reception to see if I could get some water (you would not want to drink from those taps..) to be told room service was closed and I would have to wait until 6am. Same story when requesting a password to log onto internet. A 5* hotel without water in the rooms - get real. Would never stay here again."
17,1258,"Oct 28 2009 	Never never never stay at this awful hotel	If something looks too good to be true it normally is. I was called unexpectedly to London and made the mistake of going onto lastminute for a late room. There was a 5* hotel in Park Lane advertised under 'Top Secret' - the hotel was soooo good they didn't want the name or details released as the offer was just to good to be true. Originally the price was 119 but when I came to book it was down to 99. I should say at this point that my PA was away so I took on booking responsibilities myself. Oh dear.My initial joy at snapping up such a bargain turned to concern when I checked it out on tripadvisor. Clearly quite a lot of disgruntled people.Now I am here. In this hell. My room is a converted cupboard. It smells terribly, terribly of paint. The bathroom is full of fumes. The walls are covered in scuffs, the carpet is threadbare, the wood is all chipped. The cupboards are cheap, wonky and would not be out of place in a Butlins c. 1950. The shower is a hold up over the bath job. I haven;t tried the pressure but needless to say my expectations of anything more than a dribble are incredibly low.The entire place looks jaded, tired, desolate. It really should be clsoed immediately. You should see the faces on the people walking by - nothing but glum looks. I have been in my room for an hour and have a terrible headache from the fumes. But the reception have told me they cannot move me as the hotel is full. It is awful.I feel that lastminute have a lot to answer for. How on earth can they advertise this as a top secret 'luxury' 5* hotel. It is squalid and awful.It's funny, I hadn't used them for many years but thought I would give them a try. Never again.This hotel should be clsoed immediately or advertised as a 2 star at best. it isn;t good enough for the manager to come on here and tell people he is sorry for their experience. That is too late. People need to be told before that this hotel is a 2* hotel and not a 5*. Please, please, please - if you haven;t been conned by lastminute never book this hotel!!"
18,1258,"Oct 26 2009 	3* hotel - avoid!	Tiny, dirty bedroom with an airconditioning unit and pipe going through the single-glazed window. The bathroom was tiny and diry. The dining room has poor quality food with clueless staff, who are incapable of even making a decent coffee. The famous Palm Court is as beautiful as ever, but I really wouldn't bother staying in this hotel. Just wander in, check out the lovely Art Deco public rooms and stay somewhere else!"
19,1258,"Oct 23 2009 	Very disappointing more 3* than 5*	First impressions are very impressive, as you arrive outside the entrance in Piccadilly it appears very impressive. Then as you decamp from the taxi, there is no doorman to assist with luggage. Walking through the doors you arrive in a lobby area with no staff and no signage as to where reception is, unless you look very carefully you will miss a map indicating that you are in fact at the back entrance of the hotel!! The main entrance is down a very dingy narrow back street which is very dangerous to negotiate as parked cars and cabs make you walk in the road with your luggage! When you do finally arrive at the main entrance, again, no doorman to greet you!Once inside, it again appears quite impressive, but once you start to look around the decor is very tired. Peeling wallpaper, grubby carpets, worn out furniture etc etc. Checking in was swift and professional although once checked in I enquired as to the direction of the rooms and was waived in the general direction of the lift!Once on the floor of my room, the tired decor was even more apparant, lop sided pictures hung from the wall and cracked and yellowing paint adorned each door frame. Once in the room, I was greeted with a very warm, dark, and rather whiffy room with worn and grubby carpets, yellowed and cracked paint, and a bathroom with mildew in every crevice. No tea making facilities in the room but a large and comfortable bed was evident!!The worse however, was yet to come!! After an evening out enjoying the best London has to offer, we were ready for a good night's sleep, this however took a long time to arrive. Firstly, on the ground floor of the hotel is a ballroom where company functions take place. I think we were unfortunate to saty on a night where such a function was taking place, thumping base music was going on until well after midnight which we could feel more than hear! Secondly, the walls between rooms are paper thin. Although not in a room with adjoining doors, the guest in our neighbouring room was talking the internet with various people throughout the night...all of the conversations we heard as if he was in our room!All in all, a very dissappointing experience, not what we expected from an expensive and alledged 5* hotel. Needless to say we will not be staying there again any time soon!!Please buck up your ideas with this potentially fantastic hotel Sheraton.....this should be one of your flagship hotels, it very much lets your organisation down!!"
20,1258,"Oct 22 2009 	Needs a make-over	Way overdue review - sorry folks! Stayed over Xmas holidays using Starwood points - the only thing that made this hotel palatable. The location is fabulous - several blocks away from the Underground and a walk (brisk) away from Buckingham and other sights. The rooms are OLD and require a major overhaul. We were upgraded to a suite connecting to a large double for our kids - the staff took it upon themselves to automatically upgrade us and to make sure the rooms connected!! Email communications with them were easy and fast responses. Never ate there but the dining room was quite nice and was used by many folks at many mealtimes (and little kids seemed quite welcome!). The gym is in the basement via a circuitous route but well-appointed. The stay was great (&quot;free&quot; on points) in a centrally located area (location, location, location). London is fabulous and don't really need to stay too much in one's room!"
21,1258,"Oct 20 2009 	2 star hotel 5 star death-trap	I was very disappointed with this hotel. The first room we were sent to by by the chuckling receptionist was dingy, dreary and small. No wonder the receptionist had been laughing! The bathroom was horribly drenched in condensation, so much so that I was afraid to pull back the shower curtain in case someone was still in there! After returning to reception to complain, we were sent to a slightly bigger room - No 720, which I presume is a half presentable room which management reserves for people who complain. This room initially appeared better and perhaps approached the standard of a reasonable 3 star hotel. Sadly the bathroom was a complete death trap. While in the shower the pressure and temperature suddenly changed, causing the shower head to break free of its holder and cover myself and the floor in extremely hot water as it fell to the floor. This sounds comical now but at the time was a bit painful. If I was an old person or a child I could have been badly injured.Overall this hotel is shabby and in a sorry state. If you have to stay here be prepared to argue at reception for the upgrade to Room 720 - but watch out for the Shower of Doom!"
22,1258,"Oct 17 2009 	great location wonderful staff	we stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton using our Starwood points. Only 10,000 points/nt. The location was perfect. The other Starwood hotel, the Le Meridian was right in the middle of Picadilly Circus and seemed to be in the middle of the craziness. The Sheraton was right across from the Green Park, so we walk out the door and got to see Buckingham Palace in a 10 minute walk across the park. The room was big and quite, and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The staff was very nice and helpful. They even allowed us to stay in our room until 4pm on check out day since we were Starwood Gold Members. The bus system is super easy to use in this city, so buy an all day bus pass and take a tour. I'd definately stay here again."
23,1258,"Oct 12 2009 	very hit and miss	I have stayed at this hotel ghalf a dozen time. It is very hit and miss. The big rooms that overlook the park are great. You can lie in bed and see The Eye and Big Ben. The liklihood of getting one of these rooms is pretty small. The rest of the rooms are small, damp, in desperate need of a renovation and unbelievably expensive. In my opinion this place is not worth the punt. All London hotels are expensive compared to most of the rest of the world, but this place shouldn't be a Sheraton. If you have an expectation of what a Sheraton is based on staying in lots of others, dispense with it when you check into this place. It is not even close."
24,1258,"Oct 12 2009	Refurbish this hotel now!!!!	This hotel does not qualify as a 4 or 5 star hotel...don't spend the money unless you like to be dissapointed. I read the reviews and decided to take a chance - great location but not a great hotel!! It is living in the past - A few of my complaints - 1.) main enterance is not on Piccadily but on a small alley behind hotel - no doorman to help with bags at &quot;front&quot; door. To get to the reception area you have to lug your baggage through the tea room up stairs to a shabby reception area. 2.) No complimentary internet/computer station to check e-mail - you are paying between $250 to $500 but they can't give you a couple of minutes on a computer to check e-mail or print a boarding pass - I get better service at starbucks with a $2.00 coffee (free wi-fi at starbucks). 3.) Hallways were very dark and a musty smell - I understand that the hotel is older but older doesn't = shabby. 4.) The room sure has not been upgraded in years. The bed was compfortable but for the price the room should be in better condition - peeling paint at windows, older carpet, and furnishing - the bed side lamp looked like it was going to tip over. 5) bathroom looked nice - nicely tiled and nice shower but there was a smell and the toilet leaked a large puddle on the floor. One nice thing this hotel does have is a modern work out room - didn't use it but walked by it on my way out and it looks nice."
25,1258,Oct 8 2009 	Best Location !	Comfortable (Exec. level) room. Excellent bathroom - Hotel location absolutely best!
26,1258,"Oct 8 2009 	Definitely not a five star hotel - rooms a big dissapointment	Upon entrance, the tea room / bar is very grande and stylish. There was a harpist playing and it looked very plush and comfortable. The service in the bar was very good also, and the staff very friendly.Where this hotel falls down in a big way is the rooms. They are dated and in serious need of redecoration. The rooms are stuffy with a musty smell and everything is old and tatty. The heater / dehumidifier in the room was an eye sore. The room in general was small and pretty depressing with only a view of the other side of the building.I suppose the main attraction of the hotel is it has a nice location just across from Hyde Park. Also, I think the hotel would get better reviews if it was a four star hotel because expectations assosiated with, and comparisons to other five star hotels, will leave you dissapointed. I only rated this hotel as poor as it needs to be rated on the basis that it claims to be a five star hotel, and it is a poor five star hotel. It would have scored higher if it was being rated in the four star category."
27,1258,"Sep 28 2009 	Would never ever stay there again; not even if it's free	It is listed as a 5 star hotel, but it's more like a 3 star or a bad 4 star at best. My bestfriend and I stayed there for 4 nights (Sun-Thurs) for a girls trip. The room was tired and old. The bathroom sink was cracked, carpet was dirty, and the paint was chipping off the wall. We didn't want to pay for an upgrade to a suite (which they were pushing when you check-in), not knowing that we would've got a room with view of the stairwell instead. The concierge was condescending, sarcastic and unhelpful perhaps because both my bestfriend and I look younge for our age. I go to London 3-4 times a year, and stayed at 5-6 (4-5 Stars) hotels in the city, this has got to be the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. The only positive thing I could say is the location. But I would never ever stay there again; not even if it's free."
28,1258,"Sep 23 2009 	Worst Sheraton Ever.....	The Sheraton Park Tower (where I normally stay) was showing rates of ~ $600 USD, so I chose to stay here with a rate of ~ $300 USD. The only area I feel comfortable giving this hotel a positive rating is location; the rest was abysmal. From the musty rooms with flaking paint, tired carpet and furnishings to the showers with a shower-head that doesn't function properly. Sheraton should do themselves (and all their patrons) a service by either removing the Sheraton name or completely renovating the property and making it worthy of the name.In the end, it was a very tired property with excessive rates for its class. I've stayed in much nicer properties in London for half the price."
29,1258,"Sep 23 2009 	Our stay could not have been more wonderful!	As a long-standing SPG member, I made a reservation at the Sheraton Park Lane with some trepidation after reading the negative reviews on this site. However, our stay of 7 nights, beginning Aug. 28th could not have been more wonderful. We were upgraded to a beautiful room with a lovely bathroom.By the way, the absence of a bathroom hair dryer outlet is most likely the result of a safety regulation, as my cousin stayed at the Atheneum Hotel next door &amp; had the same issue. I have been at many Sheraton Hotels featuring their &quot;sweet sleeper&quot; beds, but this was THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept on! The service we received was remarkable, especially for a large hotel. The staff was extremely pleasant &amp; helpful,fulfilling any request of ours within minutes.In addition, the Sheraton Park Lane is in a fabulous location. My husband &amp; I, who are not really walkers, were able to walk to many sights. In fact, we were in London several days before we needed to use London's superb underground system. The Green Park station is very close &amp; serves several lines. Given this location, purchasing the Hop-on Hop-off bus ticket is really unnecessary, which we unfortunately didn't realize when we bought it. Shepherd's Market, a couple of blocks away, offered several convenient &amp; varied dining choices (breakfast, lunch, dinner or late evening dessert). All in all, I'm thrilled we chose the Sheraton Park Lane &amp; recommend it highly to others."
30,1258,"Sep 17 2009 	NEVER AGAIN	OK That is my last stay in this Hotel I just can't stand it anymore.This hotel is supposed to be a 5 star hotel it bearly reaches a standars 3 stars, except for the price of course. Was there for my 6 or 7th stay had some bad experience with them already but also so good ones so I try being faithfull hopping that it pays out...Big mistake!Arrived on a thursday mentioning that my spuse will join me for the week end so it will be nice a get a nice room. After 20 minutes of explaining that I am a Platinium member and a faithfull customer of this establishment I finaly got the oldest park view room in the hotel, The room was really tired and kind of dirty, no ameneties at all was there, no bathroap. Had a bad experience for dinner at the Palm court (very rare I must say).It was even more disapointing that for once that my wife was with me I wanted her to enjoy one the the finest hotel in london and it felt like the Al multlak Hotel in Ryadh!I had to complain every day about something and once again no gesture were made toward me at all.Even better I received an email from Assistant manager the next week asking me to answer a survey as he was sure that as usual my stay at parik lane must a been a blissfull time."
31,1258,"Sep 16 2009 	In dire need of refurbishment you're better off in a Travelodge!!	I travel to London frequently for a mix of business and pleasure.I booked to stay in this hotel through lastminute.com's secret hotels deal. As a result I achieved a very very good rate. Had I paid full rack rate I was have immediately checked out upon entering (and investigating) my room.I had a classic room. Unlike some other reviewers, my view wasn't too bad. The room was keep temperate by a mobile air con unit - not something one expects to have in one's allegedly 5 star venue.The room size was fine considering central London location.The furniture and fittings were not so much old (I don't mind the classic look) as very shabby.The bed sagged in the middle.The bathroom was clean but that's about the only thing I can say in its favour. The advertised rain shower head made me think that if nothing else I might get a modern shower arrangement, but no it was not to be. The 3/4 bath did indeed have a rainhead shower unit but it was very difficult to enjoy the experience as one wrestled with the shower curtain in a scene not out of place in Psycho!!The mini bar had been removed. No water was provided.There was no kettle, and when one was requested I was told that I would have to order from room service. Price apart, the long waits and general inconvenience of having to call for a cup of tea There was no iron but one was brought very promptly when I requested it (and very promptly).On the plus side........Staff were very pleasant and helpfulPalm Court bar was very goodLocation is excellent"
32,1258,"Sep 13 2009 	Hotel rooms need updating ASAP	Booked this hotel for 7-night stay with points despite reading the so-so reviews on this site. The saving grace of this hotel is the great location!!! The management team was pleasant and efficient in answering questions prior to our arrival. Shepard's Market near by provided pub and restaurant options within 5 minute walk. (skip El Pirata around the corner, not worth the price for tapas) We were upgraded to a suite on the first floor, which barely overlooked the roof top of the restaurant below (that means no views out the window). Room 101 hasnt been updated in years: the carpet was worn and dirty, floor board creaked, bathroom light fixtures were mis-matched and not all there, and the shower curtain was no more than 1 over the tub that resulted flooring after every shower. There was a hair dryer, but nowhere to plug it in the bathroom. Perhaps no one has stayed in this room in some time because there was layer of dust on desk top and TV. Housekeeping never cleaned/replaced the coffee cups, and after 4 days we had to call to get replacements. On the other hand, they were quick in providing slippers and extra pillows as soon as we called down. We were on vacation with two other couples, and they had no luck in getting better rooms. Their rooms were in the same condition and with space barely enough to lay out suite cases. The hotel restaurant breakfast is over-priced!! 26GBP for continental breakfast buffet is outrageous, even for central London. Next trip to London, perhaps will try the other 2 spg properties close by."
33,1258,"Sep 8 2009 	A Crown Jewel	A stately gem with class and character in a prime location. We enjoyed the large and well-equipped room, spacious modern bath (the heated towel racks are a lovely touch), friendly service, and the elegant Palm Court lounge. When arriving, most taxi drivers seem to know it's more convenient to bring guests to the Brick Street entrance, but you may wish to specify just to be sure."
34,1258,"Sep 8 2009 	Oh dear oh dear oh dear!	Went for a Lastminute.com Mystery, which has worked very well in the past but this time it was a disaster. How this Hotel has the cheek to proclaim itself as 5* I have no idea. The room we had on the 6th Floor was just so tired. The bathroom was like a Victorian Spa with old chipped tiles, exposed drill holes from previous attached accessories. The room overlooked a scruffy inner courtyard with a constant whirring from a piece of machinery to listen to if you dared open the creeky window.There were no bath robes as promised in the booking. An ironing board was present but no iron! I found a housekeeper who didn't speak a word of English and had to almost play a game of Charades for ten minutes to get her to understand that I needed an iron and then it was almost unusable due to having a burnt underside. The brekafast is extortionate at 20 each and still they charge you a tray Charge if you want it in bed!I have probably spent over 1000 nights in hotel rooms in my life, but this is the first one that had no Coffee/tea making facilities in the room. You have to request them from Room service who then take an age to deliver them to your bedroom then hang around expectantly awaiting a tip for providing something that should have been in the room in the first place!On the plus side Conceirge were brilliant and arranged Phantom tickets for us at very short notice and were generally very helpful and efficient.Overall however I won't be rushing back in a hurry until Sheraton chuck a few million pounds at some serious Cosmetic surgery on this hotel as a far better standard can be obtained from lesser star rated hotels in London at a fraction of the price.The place did seem almost deserted with very few people milling around. Perhaps word has already got around to stay clear and that's why it is turning up on mystery hotels heavily discounted."
35,1258,"Sep 7 2009 	Definitely not a 5 star hotel!	I picked this hotel because is was listed as a 5 star property on Expedia. It is DEFINTIELY not a 5 star property. 3 star is more appropriate. While the service and location was fine, it is in DIRE need of a renovation. The bathroom in my room was fine, but the hallways of the hotel and my room overall was very old school. Also, when I arrived my room was not ready and I had to wait for one. In the meantime, I went to have breakfast in their main restaurant. The food was just ok and not great, and their bar/lounge scene is non-existent. The bottom line is, if they are not going to renovate this hotel it should be listed as a 3 star."
36,1258,"Sep 3 2009	Great location but that's all	We booked this as a Last Minute top secret hotel. Apart from the excellent location, right opposite Green Park, it was very poor.The room we had was dark and dingy, painted a drab grey, with some rather tired furniture. The view was to the side of another building, very unattractive. There were no tea/coffee making facilities. On the plus side, the bed was large and very comfortable. The dreadful bathroom was the worst feature of this room, absolutely ancient. Shower over a narrow bath so that the plastic shower curtain was always swishing against you - yuck. The supply of toiletries seemed random and there was no mirror for shaving or doing makeup.We did not use the restaurant or have breakfast, which we were told was 23.95.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, even at the cheap rate that we had."
37,1258,"Sep 2 2009 	Not 5 star and a bit tired	Went with friends and my wife for a 2 night stay last weekend having taken a chance on Superbreak's Mystery Hotel offer. The hotel frankly needs a refurbishment and is looking very tired. The public areas are ok but the bedrooms needs an uplift to get anywhere near a 5 star rating. Minimal tolietries, no bathrobe or slippers. Overpriced breakfast which we did not partake of due to price alone, much better to take a short walk to Shepherds Market in Mayfair. Please get rid of the teddy bear on the bed, look cute but how many people have touched this before, not nice. Convenient car park at the rear at 38 per night. Overall we enjoyed our stay but had we not been there on the offer price we would have been dissapointed."
38,1258,"Sep 1 2009 	GREAT LOCATION but.....This Hotel Needs Work!	We are SPG members, as are our friends. We had stayed at the Park Lane a few years ago, happy with the location (we love to walk and this hotel makes it easy to do so), we knew it was not up to the grade of other Sheraton Hotels we'd stayed at this summer. We were upgraded to a room with a lovely bathroom, separate shower, with a view of the Park....but the furnishings were not even garage sale quality....chipped legs, ancient dresser with drawers that would not open. We had to call for the bathrobe and slippers we knew we should have in the room....also had to call for an iron. The bath does not have an outlet for a hair dryer, and where the outlet was there was no mirror....also no hot pot to make tea in London!!!! The room needs new furniture, the hotel needs a nicer attitude...our friends complained about their room which faced an alley, and had horrible lighting..is this any way to treat SPG members? We needed an early breakfast the day we were being picked up for a tour and no one on the staff knew when the restaurant opened!"
39,1258,"Aug 26 2009 	Solid Choice for SPG members	SPG Gold member. Got two adjoining rooms at end of hall. One was a bit larger than the other. The rooms faced the front/park. The photo they show of this hotel makes it look like it's in the middle of a huge park. It is not. It is on Picadilly Street which is a main drag in london. lots of traffic. The park is across the street. The hotel is sandwhiched next to other buildings, not stand alone. But note, NOTHING is standalone in Europe. Dont know why they show a picture like that. It really doesnt matter but I thought I would point it out.This really is a prime location in my book. About a 10 minute walk to Picadilly Circus, and Soho. Quite central to most of london. Subway stop 2 blocks away and bus stop across street. The rooms we were in had been remodeled and were quite nice. Very comfortable sheraton sweet sleeper bed . Best one we had in europe. AC worked great and was quiet. Best thing is they added a third window for sound isolation to the noisy street so you barely hear any street noise. This to me is a BIG plus in noisy european citys and especially since this hotel faces a very busy street.Staff was all great and helpful. Lobby decor is very classic (and some would call dated) european 50's look. Still comfortable. Ate bar food one night for late snack and it was not bad. Tea time of course is hotel expensive and ok but there are lots better ones in london. (The tea at the Orangrey in the park is fantastic). New small italian themed cafe (forgeting the name) facing Picadilly is open for breakfast and was pretty decent and not outrageously priced like the main hotel restaurant (which we never ate at). So all in all a solid recomend. Just make sure you get an upgraded remodeled room because I'm not sure if they have done them all."
40,1258,"Aug 26 2009 	Execllent Hotel in good location with friendly staff	My partner and I stayed one night at this hotel on 22 Aug for his 50th birthday. We chose this hotel as it looked a lovely hotel and was in the exact location we wanted to be in. We had afternoon tea booked at the Ritz in the afternoon, theatre in the evening followed by a meal in Chinatown and wanted to be in walking distance of all of these which we were. We were given a lovely quiet executive room overlooking Green Park. The room was a nice size with a lovely comfortable sleeper bed. Every member of staff we saw said hello to us at all times even if just walking through the wonderful palm court. Mr Igor Buercher was extremely helpful and made sure my stay was memorable. We would not hesitate in returning to this hotel when next in London."
41,1258,"Aug 26 2009	Uncaring staff in an old neglected hotel	My wife and I recently spent three nights in this poorly run hotel. Upon check in we were promised a complementary bottle of wine which was never delivered.In addition upon arriving in our room which had a view of an airshaft and never saw sunlight. We also discovered that the room safe didn't work and that even with all of the lamps lit the room wasn't bright enough to read in comfortably. We called the desk to report the defective safe and someone from security came up to the room and confirmed that the safe was not working. He said the safe would be replaced or the room would be changed. We repeatedly reminded the staff of the problem and three days later when we left nothing had been done to correct the problems, nor was the wine delivered.At check out we were asked about how our stay was. When we informed the clerk that it was miserable. We explained the problems and he informed us that there was no mention of any of this in the computer. We then asked about compensation for this miserable experience. The clerk said he would speak to the manager, and after five minutes returned to offer 1500 Starwood points. When we voiced out displeasure with this he upped the offer to 2000 points. Woefully inadequate compensation for the lousy experience. The manager couldn't even come out to talk with us directly. No wonder the hotel is so poorly run. I am shocked that the Sheraton name is associated with such a miserable hotel. This is a place to be avoided unless you are a masochist."
42,1258,"Aug 24 2009 	A good hotel - excellent location	I had concerns staying at this hotel considering the mixed reviews noted on the different travel sites; however, I was very impressed and pleased with our stay. The room was a nice size and very modern; we stayed in an efficiency suite. The staff was very pleasant and helpful during our stay. I found the location to be ideal, close to Buckingham Palace and major shopping areas."
43,1258,"Aug 21 2009 	Location Location Location. 5 Star Staff. 5 Star Bar 	This is an excellent hotel. Aside from it's central location with a 5 min stroll to Buckingham Palace, the staff bring this place to life. They take pride in their hotel and pamper the guests on every level. My room, 644, was very nice, clean and large by London standards. It did not have a spectacular view, but was acceptable. The bathroom was long and clean, with nice traditional fixtures. I've read a few comments about the water pressure and they are true. My bath was full in less then 3 minutes. So... I'd highly recommend this hotel for it's unbeatable location and friendly staff. 2 min walk to the Hard Rock, 5 min walk to the Ritz, 10 min walk to Regent Street &amp; shopping. Busses, taxis &amp; tube are very accessible. Green Park is directly across the street and gorgeous. And don't miss the pubs &amp; cafes tucked back behind the hotel in Sheppards Market.I can't wait to return. ~ Barrett"
44,1258,"Aug 20 2009 	well situated and well appointed	As a fan of the Starwood brand, I was happy with my experience at the Park Lane. Centrally located - within walking distance to Buckingham, Fortnum &amp; Mason, the West End, Piccadilly, Canada House, the National Gallery and so much more- the Park Lane is a pleasant hotel. The staff is friendly and attentive - especially in the Palm Court (everyone was great) and Bracewells (Anne, especially was great!) - Citrus needs to pick up the pace and lead the charge at this hotel; while our one meal here was disappointing, I couldn't help but think that so much more was possible. I like to be acknowledged by the staff of a hotel, and the Park Lane excels here: from the cleaning staff to the front desk, people were truly pleasant. I'll be back."
45,1258,"Aug 17 2009 	look elsewhere. if this was the first sheraton you ever stayed in it would be the last.	long queues to check in and out caused by old IT systems. dingy rooms and public areas. noisy airco with cold winds blowing even on low setting. noise from ventilators outside if the windows open. constant slamming doors from room service/housekeeping. voices from neighbours clearly audible and also through the airco. no tea or coffee making facilities. tiny bath/shower with scalding high pressure water and wet shower curtain clinging to your back. never again!Well, the location is good, so my advice, stay out and enjoy London."
46,1258,"Aug 12 2009 	Free weekend night...mare!	Do you like to spend the night in a smelly room, with an old worn out mattress, torn out curtains, scalding showers, noisy a/c &amp; noisy bathroom pipework? Use your award points to book an overnight night at the Park Lane Sheraton Hotel. And you will be rewarded with the worst a hotel could offer you.As a member of Starwood Preferred Guest I had a free weekend night award to use until September. I booked the 8th of August for one night in a king size bedroom. When I received the confirmation they offered me to upgrade to an executive room park view for 40. I thought it would be a treat for my partner, so I booked the upgrade giving my card details for that. I did not get the room with the upgrade, I got the worst room in the building. We woke up at 5 am with the pipe noise in the bathroom (more like a Scotsman playing a bagpipe in your bathroom). And left, never to return and ready to write about and warn fellow travellers about it."
47,1258,"Aug 6 2009 	Grim and dated	Stayed one night and picked the location for its central position. The parking garage was great for our motorcycle and very reasonably priced. The reception area was strangely placed at the rear of the hotel and very small. Our room was grim and dark with cracked, marked paint and damp, peeling wallpaper. The bathroom was ancient, cracked tiles and grubby. The shower was good and powerful but set up for a midget. The shower curtain was not waterproof and the floor was swamped. I don't think the bathroom had been refitted since the thirties! A noisy, portable air conditioner made the humid night bearable. The only good thing about the room was the sweet sleeper bed.When we were checking in there were several people in reception complaining. In spite of arranging a late checkout our keys expired before lunchtime and we had to trail back to get one updated.Next time we will go back to the Waldorf - Hilton do it so much better."
48,1258,Aug 5 2009 	Great Location	The location was great we could walk to most sites but the Tube was also only a block away. The hotel was clean and had everything I needed. I would recommended it.
49,1258,"Jul 22 2009 	London Rocks	For our 1st trip to London we stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton (Suite) for 5 nights. As an SPG member I try to stay at their brands when I can and this one didn't disapoint.Not as big and opulent as the Sheraton On The Park (Sydney), but a really nice hotel in a great location, shops/cafes, Buckingham Palace are a short walk, as is the West End theatre district.If you're walking to the hotel (with bags) as we did from the nearest Underground Station (Green Park) it's easier with bags if you go up the lane before the main street entrance and go in to reception from the laneway. This way you don't have to drag bags etc through the cafe area. The laneway access is also where all the taxis pick up.The suite was lovely (if a bit cosy), awesome shower and as usual, a great Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed. Try the interesting cold drinks they have at reception every morning, some (for us) strange flavor ideas going on there.The only things I could be negative about were that there was no &quot;English Breakfast&quot; tea in the room which I thought strange as we were in England - however a quick word to Guest Services had this fixed and our room wasn't ready on arrival, however, we did get in at 8am.The staff were excellent and so was the service during our stay. This even extended to our trip by cab to the airport, when we discovered (at the airport) one of our bags wasn't in the cab, the Sheraton had already put it in another cab (at their expense) and it turned up minutes later - good work guys!!!For all the negative reports about the weather in the UK, we had blue skies and warm temps the whole time, we actually got a bit sunburnt - hard to do as we're from Australia."
50,1258,"Jul 13 2009 	Simply Superb	Before we went I checked the reviews here and was hesitant about visiting, but we keep our loyalty to Sheraton and booked anyhow. Very pleased we did! The whole experience from start to end was excellent. Staff very attentive and extremely polite, we had a superb room (329), extremely spacious, clean and quiet. The layout of the rom was very well though, and even when we had the extra bed for our daughter arrived it was still roomy and at no point did we feel cramped.The concierge helped a lot with arrangements, even putting the picnic we had got from F&amp;M on Saturday in cold storage until we needed it on Sunday.We left the car at the Sharaton Garage, very reasonable cost and again, excellent staff and the car was well looked after.Would we go back? ...in a flash yes! I am baffled by the other reviews and as a very regular traveller globally I was extremely satisfied."
51,1258,"Jul 8 2009 	Room was a let - not 5 star by any means	One night stay booked 'blind' through lastminute.com as a unnamed '5 star hotel.overlooking Green Park'. Paid 148. Managed to check in early. Christian in Reception was very good. Got Room 718. Small room. Difficult to get round door to wheel suitcase in. Very old and tired bathroom. Dripping bath taps. Water hammer noise from toilet cystern. Old mirror and fittings. Not up to standard. Sure visitors from US would laugh at the bathroom. Sure other rooms are better? Not 5 star by any means. No tea/coffee makings in room - poor show. No hotel guide book or stationery. Instead a very strange choice of glossy mag - 'Wallpaper' with lot of sexual content. Didn't use Hotel facilities - looked expensive. Great location - we were attending Buckingham Palace for garden party - very easy walk away. If I'd paid more, I would not have been a happy bunny with room, otherwise OK for a night."
52,1258,"Jul 4 2009 	I Expected More	Some web sites list this property as a 5-star. The lobby and location are great, but the rooms themselves are 3.5-star at best. There is no central air- just a noisy portable unit that you need to constantly keep running and then the room is alternatively too hot or too cold. Hotel restaurants are overpriced. High speed internet hard to get in some rooms. For the price and the star rating they try to project - I was sorely disappointed. I could have stayed at a real 5-star hotel for the same price."
53,1258,"Jul 3 2009 	Great location Service 	Stayed for 4 nights at the sheraton park lane mid June 2009. The location was excellent about a 5 min walk to the centre of Picadilly. The rooms were OK nothing special i think they need to be re-furbished to give them a lift (e.g. carpet worn, furniture worn). The staff did not seem professional and were not as helpful as they could have been. This stay would be worth it if the rooms were 100 pounds cheaper."
54,1258,"Jul 3 2009 	Overpriced Small Room Annoying Lobby Configuration	The Park Lane Sheraton is located about a ten minute walk from the Green Park Tube Station, and a 15 minute walk to Piccadilly Circus. Upon entering from Park Lane you must haul your luggage across the bar/tea room (down and up some steps) to Reception. From there you take one of two elevators to your room floor, and enter your room to discover that you can't fit your little wheely suitcase through because the bed is so close to the door. For a business hotel, I found I had to unplug lights in order to plug in my laptop. However, they did have a very reasonable wireless Internet service for a fee of 38 for the week (I stayed five days).In my room rate, at least, the 184 per night I was paying included neither breakfast nor Internet service. Now none of this is horribly surprising, given how expensive London can be, and we are pretty much in high season. However, I think you can still do better. There is no need to be so far from a Tube station, for instance."
55,1258,"Jun 27 2009 	A+ for Location B for Room Decor / Size B for Room Service	Stayed at The Park Lane Sheraton Hotel from June 20 - 26. Booked the accommodation using Starwood points. First, I agree with other contributors who reviewed this hotel that the location of this hotel is the major selling point. It's about 2 - 3 blocks away from the Green Park Tube underground station. It's a 10 minute stroll across Green Park to Buckingham Palace. There is a PRET and Starbucks about 3 - 4 blocks away from the hotel for basic breakfast and lunch, and a cafe called Henry's (http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/clubs_bars/review-515.php) also about 3 - 4 blocks away that serves a delicious breakfast at a pretty reasonable price. The hotel also has a few restaurants that serve breakfast. I tried the Citrus (http://citrusrestaurant.co.uk/). The food was good, but a bit more pricey. There's also a Marks &amp; Spencer's Simple Food (http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1160/21715.php) about 4 -5 blocks away also. It's above the Green Park Tube underground station. Finally, it's also about a 20 minute walk along Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus where you can catch a play in the neighborhood theater. Room decor / size could be better. My friend and I were originally placed in a Classic room with two single beds on the fourth floor (436). The room was very small, with very little room to maneuver. For the very first time, I ended up calling the front desk within minutes to see if we can get a larger room. The Executive rooms were not available, but the front desk asked that I inquire the next morning to see if there are any larger room. The next morning, I was able to secure a larger room on the 6th Floor (one of the Starwood Preferred Guests floor). The room was still small compared to rooms in the U.S.A., but definitely more room than the Classic room. One thing we noticed is that there are no coffee makers in the rooms (Classic and this larger one). The bathrooms in both these rooms are also very narrow. The decor of the rooms definitely need an update. Room service was also not as satisfactory compared to other hotels I've stayed at. One of the evenings, I ordered two scoops of strawberry and one scoop of vanilla ice-cream. What came was two scoops of vanilla and one scoop of strawberry ice-cream. i also ordered a bottle of Evian water. Instead, at first the room service staff forgot my bottle of water and had to go back to get it. He then brought back a bottle of water from Scotland. When I questioned about the Evian water (which was what was listed in the room service menu), he just said they didn't have it. Also, we had another situation where we couldn't figure out how come there was no air conditioning in the larger room on the 6th floor. This was the same night as the room service The Guest Service department said they would send an engineer over to check. Well, we waited and no one showed up. We decided not to press any further since the room got less warm / stuffy after we opened the windows. Well, the next day was much warmer and we had to call the engineer again. This time someone did show up and explained that the air conditioning for the entire hotel was shut off on the prior days because there were complaints from some guests about it being cold. Maybe my friend and I misunderstood him, but we found the explanation quite strange. While the room service was not as acceptable, the staff at the front desk were pretty nice and helpful. Similarly for the restaurant staff at the Citrus and the Palm Court."
56,1258,"Jun 22 2009 	Some plus points but needs to come into 21st century!	The hotel is brilliantly located, looks grand from the oustide and lobby, well designed bar and restaurant but far less so once the card slips into your room door. What a shame! Rooms are more like a holiday inn sadly, the style and luxury has faded and it all looks a bit sad; out of date, no modern, stylish touches or any real hint of thoughtful creativity in deisgn. Basic office style swivel chair sits at the table- as cold and unromantic/ basic as you could get?!This is what majority of guests will stay at a hotel like this for- a stylish, comfotable but luxurious room. Having previously stayed at the Hilton park lane the rooms here, and being only a tiny bit less price wise, do pale in comparison. Adding new bedside tables/modern chairs, a few stylish accessories and light fittings would do the trick to start with... Just better colour and style coordinated throughout really. Im amazed with so many reviews on here saying the same re. the rooms, that they have let them stay in their current state for so long. Gradually the bathrooms should also be updated!Gym is a plus point but having only stayed one night cant comment on too mcuhl else but the room!"
57,1258,"Jun 17 2009 	Great location service ok it is a 4*	The location is great, the food from the hotel and in the cafe (Citrus) are excellent. The rooms are ok, old-style. But definitely is not a 5*, mainly because of their service, that is ok, but not great. Consider it a good 4*, and you will not be dissapointed."
58,1258,Jun 16 2009 	Amazing experience at a 5 star hotel	I stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane in June and had an amazing experience celebrating my anniversary with my girlfriend. The staff were very professional and helpful during my stay and answered all my queries regarding my stay and made sure I was satisfied with my room which was upgraded for my stay. Mr Igor Buercher from Sheraton was extremely helpful and made sure my stay was memorable. The service and location was excellent and allowed me to get around London very easily.The attention to detail during my stay was excellentI look forward to returning to Park Lane Sheraton
59,1258,"Jun 11 2009 	A very good stay	We found an incredible deal on Expedia for this hotel. It cost us under $300 (usd) for a junior-type suite. We did have to prepay the hotel to receive this deal but it was worth it and there is a cancellation policy so we felt secure. The suite was very large (queen bed, 2 desks, couch, coffee table, 2 easy chairs, fridge, 2 closets, etc.) and we had plenty of room to pad around. The bathroom was large compared to standard London bathrooms - separate tub and shower. I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair 2 years ago for $475 (usd) and the room and bathroom would have fit inside this junior suite.GREAT location (Green Park across the Street and tube station 3 blocks away) and the staff was friendly and accomodating. You have to purchase a timed pass to use the computer in a room off the lobby and we used up a few minutes of our time because of a computer problem so they gave us an additonal pass for free - no questions.There's a wonderful small &quot;locals&quot; pub a couple of hundred yards in back of the hotel (can't remember the name) that the concierge recommended and we had a great fish and chips meal.We never ate at the hotel but the Afternoon Tea looked delicious.Buy an Oyster Pass from a tube station if you don't plan on taking taxis. We rode all around London (tube and bus) for 5 days and it cost us each around $40 usd . Each day it has a maximum deduction so after you reach that amount they stop deducting from the pass. A GREAT deal!!"
60,1258,"Jun 11 2009 	4 star perhaps not 5.	I stayed in the Sheraton park Lane weekend of 4th &amp; 5th June and as I am a starwood member, had enough points to get one night free.I had been in london for the week on business and was staying in a 4-star hotel in Marlebone for the previous 3 nights, so was looking forward to my husband joining me for the weekend and moving to the 5 star Park Lane. Unfortunately I was really disappointed and wished I had stayed on in the Marlebone hotel. The positives about Park Lane are of course the location, it is wonderful. The food was wonderful also, Afternoon tea in particular was amazing. But after you leave this wonderful part of the hotel and go to your room, it is a different story.The most disappointing things for me, besides the fact that the room was extremely basic and badly needed refurbishment, was that there was no robe, slippers or tea/coffee facilities - basics in any 4/5 star London hotel. There was 1 shampoo, 1 conditioner and 1 soap (all very small sizes) left for both my husband and I....and no shower gel/bath lotion. I walked down to reception to express my disatisfaction, the girl was very pleasant and immediately sent up all of the above to our room. I feel it is very poor that I had to ask for these simple and basic things in a 5-star central London location.I filled up a comments card in the hotel, mentioning all the above points but I have heard nothing from them since.This hotel is definitely not a 5-star hotel, and I am very very surprised that it is ranked as such."
61,1258,"Jun 8 2009 	If This Is 5 Stars I'd Hate To See 4!	This hotel is a pit! The rooms haven't been updated in decades, there is no air conditioning and most rooms have no view unless you like looking out the window and seeing an escape ladder and exhaust fans. The lobby is non-existent and the only real choice of restaurants are the far to formal offerings in the hotel itself. The only positive thing I can say about this place is the staff is as accommodating as they can be with what they have been given to deal with. This is not a great hotel and far too expensive for what you get; small, outdated, ugly, hot rooms."
62,1258,"Jun 3 2009 	excellent hotel and location	we have recently stayed at this hotel and was very sceptical following bad reviews however, i can only say visit the hotel for yourself to see how lovely it is.. we stayed last weekend and booked because we were going to a concert at the O2 and got a great deal. The location could not be better, great for the tube although never needed it as everything is walking distance .. leicester square, buckingham palace, piccadilly circus, knightsbridge, marble arch.. couldnt have asked for more. the hotel is very grand and the room we were allocated was lovely.. very quiet and very clean.. staff were extremely polite.the only downside to the hotel was that the drinks at the bar were very expensive but expected. im not a snob but do enjoy good quality and i cannot fault the hotel for anything.... there is a great little pub/cafe called Henrys 5 mins walk from the hotel serving all day food which was great for breakfast etc...all in all, worth every penny..."
63,1258,"Jun 1 2009 	Nice hotel great location but rooms are tiny	Normally get upgraded to a larger room due to SPG status. However, all the hotels were fully booked due to the garden show, and I was assigned a &quot;regular&quot; room.The room was clean, but it was tiny. Even by European hotel standards. The hotel was lovely, especially the lobby and cafe area. And the service is impeccable.The location is beyond amazing as it is right beside Green Park and close to Piccadilly Circus."
64,1258,"May 27 2009 	Nice old-style hotel in convenient location	I agree with much of what's already been said in previous reviews. The hotel is very well-situated, which is it's main selling point. Very close walking distance to tube stations, several bus stops just outside and also close walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, attractions, etc. Also a big convenience was that it's on the Picadilly tube line - which is the one from Heathrow. We took the tube from Heathrow r/t and it was easy, cheap and convenient. We used Starwood points so I can't really speak to the value of the room price. The room was clean and large. Huge, marble bathroom with a tub and very large seperate shower. There was also a walk-in closet. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Front desk was well-staffed and courteous. One minor hiccup - we arrived early and were told to come back at about 1:30 or 2:00 when our room would be ready. When we came back at just after 3:00 pm, the room still wasn't ready, but it was just about 10 more minutes so it did work out fine. One other downside (as previously mentioned) was the cost of the internet in the business center. It was outrageous. We ended up just browsing guidebooks at a bookstore when we needed specific info, but definitely find another place to use the internet and save money. There are some internet cafes around and I saw signs advertising 1 pound for an hour (rather than 5 pounds for 15 minutes at the hotel!)"
65,1258,"May 26 2009 	DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL!!	I was so annoyed with my stay at the sheraton park lane hotel that I signed up to to the trip advisor website just to write this review.I stayed on the 2nd of May 2009 for my sisters wedding. Check in took 2 hours after they sent me to an occupied room and then a dirty room with not even an apologie.2 weeks later I check my bank statement and they charge me twice the amount - I could not believe it!!!This is the biggest dump of a hotel I have ever stayed in my entire life, save your money and do NOT stay in this hotel... I repeat do NOT stay in this hotel!!!WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH - 5 star..... Your having a laugh!!"
66,1258,"May 25 2009 	Great hotel but needs some work	I have stayed at this hotel in the past and will stay again in the future. The rooms are fine, but could be updated a little bit. We had a room (#711) that was oversized and overlooked green park. At night we could sit in bed and look at the London Eye and Big Ben. The service was first rate when something was requested, but if things were not requested, they were sometimes overlooked. For example, we were only given one bar of soap for a 5 night stay. But they quickly fixed it when we asked for more. There was a food charge on our room that we did not make, and when we brought this to the attention of the front desk, it was quickly taken off of our room. The hotel is in a great location and met all of our needs. One of things that we enjoyed was the free bottles of water that were given out by the front desk."
67,1258,May 24 2009 	perfect location excellent staff lovely room	I was a little nervous staying at the Sheraton Park Lane I had read some bad reviews I was going for a week and was paying for two nights and using points for the other 5. I was so pleasantly surprised we had an exueuctive room over looking the park very large king size room with a marble bathroom. The staff was excellent and a few things I needed they were there immediately. I would recommend highly It needs a lille updating but that would not keep me from going back and for course Green Park is the best location.
68,1258,"May 19 2009 	Great location but not-so-great hotel.	My husband and I spent three nights at the Park Lane hotel while we were vacationing in London. The hotel was very well located on the edge of Green Park; a 5 minute walk through the park to Buckingham Palace, and a 5 minute walk to the Green Park underground station on the Picadilly Line. Absolutely no complaints from a location perspective.A bit of a disappointment was the hotel itself. It is in dire need of renovation; the rooms are definitely showing their age and lacked the luxury feel normally associated with the Sheraton hotel chain. We had a one-bedroom suite, but the room was oddly set-up; you entered into the middle of a hallway; turn left and you go into the bedroom, turn right and there is a random sitting room area at the other end of the hall which really served no purpose. The furniture was all awkwardly placed and looked as though it had been there since the hotel's beginning. The only saving grace was that the king bed was a Sweet Sleeper bed that was very comfortable.Overall, the location was great; the hotel was so-so; but certainly a disappointment considering the rate per night."
69,1258,"May 19 2009 	Great location but not a 5 star hotel	The hotel was wonderful, but if I had been paying anything close to the rate offered through most on-line services, I would have been unhappy.My biggest complaint was internet access. The hotel changes ~$10.00 an HOUR extra for internet. There is a reduced rate if you purchase longer periods (per day or per week), but to not include this in the base rate is unacceptable. In addition to the high additional fee, once you pay it's only good for a single computer, so if you travel with a spouse that has her own machine, you have to pay twice! Ta.Steve Porter"

71,1258,"May 17 2009 	We enjoyed a great stay at a great rate.	Over the years, I've stayed at the Park Lane Hotel several times, including this past month. My wife and I enjoyed a great stay there at a great rate. The location is unbeatable--a short walk to Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, the theater district, the shops of Oxford Street and Bond Street, Soho, etc. And--unusual for anywhere in the West End--there's even a Sainsbury's Supermarket, a Marks and Spencer food store and a Boots Pharmacy within a few blocks of the hotel. We found the staff friendly and efficient (the assistant manager, Igor Buercher, was particularly accommodating and eager to please.) And we were fortunate to get a really nice, large comfortable room with a view of the rooftops of Mayfair, at a really good promotional rate (three nights for the price of two.)We can't comment on room service or any of the other hotel amenities, but we did treat ourselves to cocktails in the hotel's magnificent art deco lounge. A harpist accompanies an elegant and luxurious tea service there in the afternoon. These are experiences hard to duplicate in a modern, cookie-cutter hotel. If you're looking for old world charm (albeit a bit frayed at the edges), in the same prestigious location as the Ritz, the Intercontinental and the Dorchester, at a great value, I recommend the Park Lane Hotel. No doubt the hotel today is need of updates and renovation, and, as with most older London hotels, you might end up with accommodations that are smaller then you expected, or have no view, etc. But, when Sheraton gets around to refurbishing the Park Lane to its former glory, it will undoubtedly be one of London's best. And it will also surely be much more expensive."
72,1258,"May 15 2009 	Great location but room and hotel common areas need upgrading	I stayed here for 2 nights. I received some type of upgrade as a SPG Gold member but I think it was only to the SPG floor. The room was decent with a flat screen TV, nice bed and big bathroom but the furniture and walls needed upgrading. They are so old. Still, it wasn't too bad and I got a really good rate. The location made up for any negatives about the hotel. It's right across the street from Green Park and within walking distance of Piccadilly and Knightsbridge. Plus, the buses run so often in front of the hotel that I just used them as ways to get around town (no need to walk to the Tube station and down into the caverns). The staff was generally nice, polite and professional. I also found them to be very helpful with directions and suggestions for places to eat and visit. I would definitely stay here again with the right deal."
73,1258,"May 13 2009 	Great location rooms just ok	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights while traveling in Europe. My husband and I are gold Starwood members, and are supposed to get a room upgrade if available, but unfortunately the hotel did not have it available. The first room we were shown to smelled of smoke, even though we had requested non-smoking. It was also extremely tiny - we could barely fit our luggage and ourselves in the room. We called down to the desk and fortunately they were able to change our room. Our new room was much larger than the previous one, even though it was supposedly not an upgrade. I found that rather strange.The location is great - right by Green Park, very near the Green Park tube station. Considering the rainy weather in London, I was very surprised they did not provide an umbrella for guests in the closet. Using the business center to check in to your flight was free, but any other use of the business center is charged for."
74,1258,"May 13 2009 	Horrible Plumbing	This is a beautiful hotel with a great bar and common room, but the guest rooms were somewhat of a joke. My boyfriend and I stayed here and the toilet would not flush, so we called the front desk. They sent someone up in a timely manor, but simply told us the plumbing was old and that you had to flush it wih a lot of force??? Honestly it was a joke, you had to use all your strength and pump it like 10 times to get just toilet paper down. I will spare you the other details. The shower was pretty poor, the water pressure and the shower head were from the 1700's. The bed was great, but I have seen better at a 5 star hotel. Overall the location is perfect and near many great resturants, but I wouldn't say the price is worth the room we were given."
75,1258,"May 13 2009 	Perfect Park Lane made maiden trip with child unforgetable!	Form the moment we walked in, the staff was friendly, professional, and extremely helpful to the our somewhat unique needs. With 10 month old baby in tow, and another on the way, travel can be somewhat taxing. But our decision to stay at the Park Lane was rewarded with a level of service that was truly Five Star. Additionally, the spacious rooms were very comfortable, and the location couldn't be better. Very good value, and I highly recommend it."
76,1258,"May 11 2009	Gorgeous hotel really central	I visited this hotel in March 09 with my parents who are in their 50's.Hotel was perfect place to stay in, was convenient for everything we wanted to do-shop, sight see, west end musicals etc and there was a lovely atmosphere in the area. We got it at a reduced price so it was good value for money but i'd say if we hadn't gotten a reduced rate it would have been incredibly expensive. One of the negatives was that our breakfast wasn't included in the price and we had to go elsewhere for food as all meals were ridiculously dear. Another slight negative was that the hotel was on the oldish side and the bathrooms were a little shabby and could have done with being refurbished. Overall it was an excellent stay and we would love to stay there again."
77,1258,"May 10 2009 	Great Location nice room size for london	We stayed a week and had a great time. Located right accross from the entrance to green park and only a few blocks from picadilly circus. The loft suite is great with tons of storage and space. The bathroom could use an upgrade but was very clean. The &quot;city&quot; view was litterally the wall of the building next door. I honestly could not imagine a better location for a hotel in london. Restaurants and pubs of mayfair, picadilly circus and green park tube station 3 blocks away. And right accross from a great park."
78,1258,"May 9 2009 	Bring your own disinfectant	This hotel probably has the grubbiest, shabbiest bathrooms I have ever experienced. And, of course, I have seen some bad ones in my time.I had the uncertain pleasure of attending an industry-dinner there this week. As the greying elders of the venerable association waxed lyrical about their 39 years in the trade, it occured to me that the Sheraton bathrooms have almost certainly not been refurbished once whilst these gentlemens careers had flourished.Was it the once-white now much yellowed toilet seat? Was it the grime so engrained in the floor tiles that you really didnt want to go bare foot in the bathroom? Or the cracked tiles on the walls? The shoddily patched up bath? Etc, etc. Take your pick.Thinking it might have just been my unlucky night, I did ask for another room. The reception staff were helpful enough but assured me that all the other &quot;classic&quot; rooms had bathrooms to the same standard. I was offered another room and it was indeed just as bad. So I conclude they were telling the truth. All the bathrooms in the standard - er, sorry, classic - rooms are probably just as diabolical.The room itself was your average &quot;great-location-faded-glory&quot; stuff : a ragbag mixture of fixtures, furnishings and useless junk crammed in the not-unexpectedly small space. The carpet was so dirrty, it was beyond cleaning. They would have been better-off just throwing out half of the junk furniture and leaving some space to move in the room. Perhaps they just left it in there in the hope of hiding the carpet.There were two plus-points though: the bed itself was clean and comfortable and the room was quiet.I should not have been surprised. The Sheraton is probably not the only hotel in a prime location that gets away with appalling quality. I do not doubt they will continue to do so. At 220 per night, I would much rather stay at one of the cheaper-but-cleaner chains and take my better half out for an expensive meal with the money saved!"
79,1258,"May 5 2009 	Not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of imagination	After booking through Ian in Justonehotel.com (very helpful) after paying over 200 per night for the may 2010 bank holiday weekend I was expecting a luxury 5 star hotel. I need not have been as this place is no where 5 star standard. Very very delapidated throughout. Its a joke having to carry your luggage through the bar (up/down various steps) all the way to the rear of the hotel where the reception is! Though we found out later there is a an entrance to the rear it is only suited to those arriving by car not on foot... But this really wasnt the end of the world I guess. Our room was one of the smallest I've stayed in (room 216) and the smell of fresh paint very overpowering. The bed was superb - one of the comfiest I've stayed in. The view was awful... The sky not visible from the room, all that is visable is the adjacent building and dozens of vents about 10 feet away. You could not open the window as both the noise of the vents and the smell from them was like that of a landfil. Unbarable. The bathroom was very poor. Overall the room was very depressing and certainly encouraged us to see as much of London as possible and avoid time spent in the &quot;cell&quot;. On Saturday morning 2nd May while waiting for the lift near our room, I politely asked a porter who was passing by in the corridor if it would be easy to hail a taxy outside ourselves or would I be better off phoning for one?? - I was amazed by his response - He simple shrugged his shoulders without making eye contact and kept walking mumbling &quot;I dont know...&quot; I said excuse me??? But he completly ignored us and kept walking!!! My fiance who was with me pleaded with me not to make a 'scene' by calling a manager so we let it go! The rest of the staff were very polite and helpful.Anyway overall the location is very good only 9 or 10 mins walk to Picadilly Circus and loads of nice resteraunts nearby.If they spent some dosh ( a lot of dosh) doing the place up throughout restoring it to its original elegance and you booked a park view room and did not encounter certain rude porters I reckon the hotel would be very good. However at the moment in my humble opinion its 3 star at very best!"
80,1258,"May 4 2009 	AVERAGE AT BEST..	Our hopes were high but they needn't have been!We arrived at the hotel at 7.30 in the evening only to be told our room weasn't ready and we would have to wait a further 45 minutes! After expressing our disappointment, we were reluctantly &quot;found&quot; a room.I booked the trip as I was running the London Marathon the following morning, though breakfast wasn't served early enough to enjoy before the race. We proceeded to the &quot;Citrus&quot; restaraunt during the evening, where we found the menu rather limited to say the least. We ordered the mash as a sie order which was brought midway through the meal, and the waiter we were allocated had a bad command of English, and was not able to explain the menu. Overall, very disappointing for a pricey experience.We stayed at the Crowne Plaza at Shoreditch last year which was much preferred, and will certainly be looking to avoid this hotel next year."
81,1258,"Apr 29 2009 	Stay at another hotel	Thoroughly disappointed in the room. The room was small, very outdated, poorly furnished, stains on pillow cases and had a loud portable air conditioner in the room. And, it's hard to forget the double bed that had a single bed headboard. The bathroom door lock was broken and the shower head wouldn't stay in place. At best, the room we had was as bad as any one star hotel in the states and any one or two star hotel in Europe. It is convenient to Green Park, but if you're looking for any signs of nightlife, the location is out of the way. I travel frequently throughout Europe and Asia and I must say that this was the worst room I've had for the money spent. If you don't believe me, just look at my photographs of the room."
82,1258,"Apr 20 2009 	Excellent	My husband and I stayed 3 nights at The Park Lane. We celebrated an anniversary, and because I had read some negative reviews I had some concerns. We stayed in a superior room, and we were very satisfied! The room was refurbished, big and clean, with an wonderful big bed. The location of the hotel was perfect. The first night we dined i the Citrus restaurant, the food was great and the service was wonderful. I will book this hotel if (when) I am going back!"
83,1258,"Apr 15 2009 	Will be going back very soon.	Just stayed at the park lane hotel and had no problems with room,location, or staff.I had read reviews on the hotel and was a bit doubtful about my choice.I stayed for four nights and found the staff very helpful and polite my room was big bright and airy and the location is excellent.I would recommend this hotel to a friend.I would like to say thank you to Nicolas the manager for all his help and I hope to be back soon linda"
84,1258,"Apr 13 2009 	A wonderful well located and welcoming hotel	Location is perfect,walking in the parks opposite of poppint inti Shepard market for a cosy meal."
85,1258,"Mar 29 2009 	Awesome location but not worth the price tag.	We stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane hotel for one night in March. We arrived at 2:30pm. We took the tube from Heathrow airport and arrived hoping to get straight into a room. Check in time is 3pm but we didnt get into our room until 4pm. We did receive an upgraded room, but that was because we are Platinum Sheraton members. We were given one round of free drinks at the Palm Court bar, but that really doesnt make up for a 90 minute delay. The lobby is small and there are very few places to sit (while waiting for family members to check in). When entering the hotel from the Park side (which absolutely feels like the most used and recognizable side) you have to drag your bags through the Palm Court restaurant. There are NO ramps into and out of the sunken restaurant/lounge, so you end up dragging bags DOWN then UP stairs all the while passing people having afternoon tea. It is such a bizarre set up. There are NO bellmen to meet you at the entrance. I thought we must have missed a sign or just been unusual in our choice of entrance. While staying at the hotel for 36 hours, I saw numerous others have to deal with the same awkward situation. Also, who wants to have afternoon tea with weary travelers lugging their bags through the tea room?The room: The room had a single queen size bed (very comfy!). Our third adult had to sleep on a sleeper sofa (you could feel the bars through it). Our room was clean and had probably been redone recently (compared to the other reviews on this site, we must have gotten a new room). Our room was on the 7th floor and faced the park, the eye, Big Ben, etc It was a spectacular view. The room was classified as a suite, but it had NO tea/coffee making services. We had to call down to get a tea making service (2 pound delivery charge). Be careful the shower is SUPER slippery and the tub has very high sides (hard to get in/out of).Transportation to hotel: If you are coming from Heathrow, do not waste your money on the Heathrow express! The underground (on the Piccadilly line) takes you directly from Heathrow to the Green Park exit (just a 5 min walk to the hotel). If you take the Heathrow express, then you move fast and have fewer stops BUT you have to change trains! So, dont take it. Just take the tube. Its about 4 pounds per person for a single.When you are moving about the city, purchase a day pass (about 7 pounds) and you can use the tube all day. You can also purchase a 24 hour pass onto the tour bus (there are a few different ones). You can hop on and off as much as you want throughout the day. The tour buses stop at most of the major attractions. You can easily walk to Buckingham Palace from the hotel (changing of the guard every other day). You can also easily walk to the Marble Arch. Everything else is easily accessible by tube or bus. This hotel is expertly located in the city, but it does NOT feel like a 5 star hotel. It feels like an old hotel with a great location. Check in wasnt impressive but the concierge was excellent. He always greeted me with a smile (even the 6 times I bugged him during our 90 minute wait for a room). Id recommend this hotel because of its location but it costs too much for what it is."
86,1258,"Mar 27 2009 	Not a 5 star hotel at all	Old, weary. Chipped paitings. Dark rooms. No window view. Only thing new - Plasma TV. Good beds though. Also great location. But that was it.We booked and payed through www.hotwire.com. When we arrived, they did not find us. No one offered to call Hotwire. I did it myself, it took 10 minutes on the phone before they had faxed over our papers.Then the hotel started to bill us for the stay and unknown stuff. We all of a sudden had a 400  bill (both our rooms). We called down about this and they removed it. Next night (our last) we woke up and we'd gotten a new bill for 110 . No problem fixing this, but clearly there was a misunderstanding about everything. So if you stay here, do follow up on your bill. This was to us, very negative. Like they almost tried to cheat us. We had one drink at the hotel bar, 15  for one gin tonic drink."
87,1258,"Mar 19 2009 	Deserves a much higher ranking	OK, so some of the rooms are a bit cranky. But book a higher grade room or better still, have SPG gold or platinum status and get it as a free upgrade and you're in one of London's best hotels by any yardstick.We were allocated a very comfortable and genuinely well appointed suite overlooking Green Park (651). Flat screen LCD TVs, best beds in in town, classy art deco themed bathroom with separate shower, it ticked all the boxes and then some for a few nights' sightseeing in town.Service is efficient without being overly fawning or sycophantic:Luggage was in the room when we arrived back having checked in earlier in the day. The Dorchester could learn a thing or two in that regard.The bar is one of London's best venues for pre dinner /theatre drinks. Mandeep the barman makes the best martinis anywhere. For that alone I could stay there....almost.Room service arrived on time and as ordered and was pretty good value for money too. A very good roast beef sandwich with fries for around 12 pounds.Concierge was helpful and took time to make sure we could find our way to the O2 arena for a concert. Parking is super efficient and immediately opposite the hotel.What else could you want from a London hotel? Its location is great for Mayfair and Shepherds market restaurants and a couple of increasingly rare &quot;proper english pubs&quot;. We walked everywhere via Green Park and st James's Park to see the changing of the guard, cabinet war rooms, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, London Eye with a very nice lunch in the Royal Festival Hall on the first floor restaurant overlooking the Thames. If you want to pay 400+ pounds a night there are numerous alternatives, but overall this place continues to be our preferred hotel in London."
88,1258,"Mar 16 2009 	Experince London's old world charm with modern convience	This is our third time staying at this hotel and every time it never disappoints. Not only is in a great location, only a walk away from the green park tube, but the rooms are HUGE by English standard, and big by American, and the hotel is very clean. But keep in mind that this hotel is old if you come. The lifts are small and it makes it hard to drag your bags around the lobby area. Also there are hot and cold water faucets, but that's all part of the old world charm. The carpets could use a makeover but other than that the rooms are great. The staff are very friendly but the restaurant isn't worth the money there are plenty of other places around to find better food for a better price. A tip to future travels: have the cab take you to the back entrance when you arrive. That is where the lobby and the check in desk are located. Otherwise you will have to cross the parlor with all your bags."
89,1258,Mar 12 2009 	Solid hotel excellent location	Very pleasant property with gracious staff in a super location.
90,1258,"Mar 11 2009 	On second thougth... very good!	We went to Park Lane mainly for sentimental reasons, as I used to stay there as a child  and that is quite a while ago. We had read the previous TripAdvisor reviews (and, lets face it, disastrous rank), were warned that we should not expect perfect amenities and since we are awful shabby lovers, fellt quite brave about it and decided to book anyway. We were given a standard room which would be considered large to any standard anywhere in Europe, so very big to London standards, yet I must say as we entered the room, our first feeling was that this was probably the  limit of shabby  we were prepared to accept. Bathroom definitely needs some serious lifting. All the fittings are old but luckily of excellent quality. Toiletries are quite austerous (not that it is amongst our priorities but more indulgent ones might make up a little for the worn joineries). As for the bedroom, replacing the rather worn carpet by some more durable, more hygienic wooden floor might be an option (I must stress that insonorisation seems quite efficient). as well as rethinking the painting on the walls. No choice of pillows but perfect mattresses and excellent linen.That is for the standard bedroom because otherwise the hotel is really nice all the way to the bedroom door. It has that Old World feel that we tend to get back to after two decades of minimalism.That was our very first impression. However after three days and from the warm smile at the reception desk to the wave of the doorman as we departed (staff is extremely helpful and eager to please !), from the fresh orange juice at breakfast to the relaxing tea in the lobby or great late night cocktail, from easy strolls in the park opposite the street to great museum and shopping sprees all within walking distance, we had been converted -and decided we might probably not consider any other place in London, no matter the bathrooms.We actually decided to go back next autumn our choice, this time, being based on more than just sentimental reasons.Oh. And for those breakfast aficionados, the  continental breakfast  is actually an excellent and varied cold buffet breakfast.So as a summary (no AA rating. just mine):- Bathroom and bedroom 3*- Mattress 5*- Breakfast 4 or 5*- Location 5* one cant beat the location !- Staff 5*"
91,1258,"Mar 4 2009 	3-star hotel posing as 5-star hotel	1. It's 2009, why are there still 2 separate faucets for hot and cold water in the bathroom sink?2. The website said there were tea/coffee facilities in the room. Not true, I had to call to request this and be told that I would be charged 2 pounds per day for that! Finally, I convinced the hotel not to charge me, but they did not stock it adequately on even a once daily basis. For example, having only decaf coffee on two days, with almost no choice for tea, and no decaf or herbal tea choices.3. Inadequate lighting in the room even with all the lights on.4. Charging 18 pounds per day for internet access, an absurd amount.5. Stairs all over the lobby, entrance, reception area - NOT helpful for wheeled luggage, baby stroller, not to mention handicap access!6. Stairs even within the restaurant area, and in and out of the hotel.7. This hotel is in woeful need of renovation.8. The tap in the bathtub dripped when not on and I was almost scalded the first time I took a bath. This was fixed after I let management know."
92,1258,"Feb 21 2009 	Great locationgreat serviceneeding deep renovation	I was attending a Conference at the hotel so it was the best possible location for me. Moreover for the ones arriving at Heathrow airport is very easy to reach by the underground, since the Hotel is near the Green Park station - and will only cost you 4 pounds! The location is great, within a walking distance from Green Park, Hyde Park and Piccadilly Circus. The service and staff are great, always being polite and helpful. I would expect however a more complete continental breakfast. This hotel needs deep renovation! Of course the rooms are cozy and have all that you need for a comfortable stayBut everything is pretty old! The bathroom was the thing that intimidated me the most: it must have more than 30 years and when I was taking a bath the water temperature went from freezing cold to steaming hot inexplicably! I think that the price doesnt match the actual standard of the facilities. If you, like me, are going for a short period and for professional reasons I guess this hotel would be finebut in my opinion London as much more offer similar/better than this at the same/lower rates."
93,1258,"Feb 18 2009 	Very Good Location...Good Hotel	As we booked our trip we read some of the ratings about this hotel and felt a little worried. We are a mid 20's couple that went to london for an extended weekend looking to hangout. This hotel is in an excellent location...you have the picadilly line right at your finger tips. We walked 95% of time time due to the excellent location. Walking distance to buckingham palace, bond street,regent street, and oxford street. These are major shopping areas that you would want to see. There are excellent pubs and clubs in walking distance. Never felt scared walking back to our hotel at 2 or 3 in the morning. Always a lot of people around. The hotel itself is good. The lobby is excellent and the staff was very helpful. You just have to ask the questions. We got a great deal on a room for around 160 a night U.S currency. The room was smaller in size but clean. The bathroom was small but did its purpose. Always fresh towels and great service. As on vacation we really did not spend a lot of time in our room."
94,1258,"Feb 17 2009 	Decent stay.	The hotel seems to get some bad press on this site. We enjoyed the experience. We stayed as two couples in two rooms over the new year. The bedrooms were fine, lovely beds, the bathrooms quaint. It's probably difficult to renovate and improve the size of the bathrooms in old buildings, ours had character. Never seen a large, deep bath fill so quickly though!! Reception is at the back of the hotel, probably to facilitate a more leasurely taxi drop off than on the busy Picadilly. A lack of tea/coffee making facility seemed odd!Location is superb. Across the road, a 5min stroll to the gates of Buck Palace. Turn left out of hotel, a 10 minute stroll gets you to Picadilly Circus. Turn right then right onto Park Lane and 10 mins gets you to Marble Arch and Oxford Street shopping. Tube with M&amp;S food outlet, 200 yds away on the left. Behind the hotel is a warren of streets composing Shepherd's Market. Restaurants, Pubs and shops abound. Ideal for a safe, quiet evening, eating, drinking or strolling!We had a good deal through priceline. I was aghast at the rack rates when I enquired further. Great hotel if you get the right deal."
95,1258,"Feb 13 2009 	Sadly this place is getting worse if it was even possible!	I wrote a review in Dec 2007 when I stayed at this place for the first time, and swore off this property, I've stayed at most of London's 5 Star hotels as I travel to London on business several times a year, and not really loyal to any particular chain. This last stay I stayed for a night on the way to Africa and on the way back. My PA made the bookings as everything else was booked and this was a last minute trip.I dreaded returning to the hotel as my last experience was very bad, and the hotel lived up or should I say down to my expectations. Its simply amazing that this hotel can be classified as a 5 star facility or that it can even stay in the Starwood chain. Starting with the lobby, or lack of, there's simply no lobby, and to get to the check in area you either take the back entrance from the back street which feels like a servant's or workman's entrace, or from Piccadily and go through the tea room. Don't expect help with your luggage, you won't get it.The staff at the reception are neither friendly nor interested, I'm a Gold SPG card holder and was travelling with another traveller who has an Owners Card (the highest you can get in SPG), when we go to other facilities, the reception he gets is befitting royalty, but not here. When we checked in the young lady at the reception (Eastern European, like ALL the staff at the hotel) barked at us that she can only check in one guest at a time, that's because we gave her both passports at once, even though we were using one credit card for both rooms..The rooms are atrocious, but starting with the hallways, old 70s frayed carpet, and rooms doors, pained an ancient cheap looking brown, and all scarred, quite dingy and depressing.The rooms are horrible, not clean, drafty, and don't even get me started on the bathrooms. This place should be SHUT DOWN, ASAP.Shame on you Sheraton, and Shame on you Starwood."
96,1258,"Feb 13 2009 	Better than average Sheraton	US based Sheraton hotels are typically more budget oriented than I like for vacation purposes. However, I found this hotel to quite above normal Sheraton standards, it is in a great location and the staff was excellent. My wife and I had a very nice meal on the recommendation of the concierge who went out of his way to help us.I had the unique opportunity to see both a standard room and an upgraded room as we broke our trip into two parts. The standard room is nothing much to speak of. It isnt bad in any way, just small and very much like most rooms you might find in a New York hotel (small, uninspiring view, etc.). The upgraded rooms are much larger across the board and definitely more relaxing. I think both rooms could use some help with lighting, but other than that, they are fine.My bases for comparison are the Luxury Collection and Westin Hotels at which I usually stay. While this hotel is not in that realm, it is a clean and reasonably comfortable hotel with a fantastic location. Its an easy walk to many of the tourist sites as well as to Waterloo station for sojourns out of town. Its convenient from the Tube and close to the Shepherds Market area for food and drink."
97,1258,"Feb 12 2009 	Outstanding Visit	This was my first stay at The Park Lane and based on the mixed reviews from the past, I was concerned. However, from the moment I checked in, I knew my stay would be a wonderful one. My room, a spacious studio suite on the top floor, had a great view of the park and despite facing the busy Pacadilly St., it was absolutely QUITE day and night! Excellent double windows - 3 great windows in the room, great light, spacious bathroom with a window, too. Clean, pleasantly appointed, and absolutely quite room, from now on, every trip to London I make I will stay at the Park Lane Sheraton and hope to be in room 851."
98,1258,"Feb 12 2009 	Plan Wisely	I was somewhat nervous about booking this hotel because of the mixed reviews. Before I booked I called the hotel and spoke to a lady on the front desk - she assured me ALL the rooms were first-class, but, the Executive Rooms were..as she put it &quot;guaranteed&quot;. She explained that most of the standard rooms have yet to be updated, but all the Executive rooms had been.So - it cost me about $180 to upgrade - we stayed for 4 nights and paid a total of $824. We booked through the American Airlines site. This was a great deal!Our first room (on the 8th floor) was poor. Very loud noise coming from water pipes in the stairwell and the room had an odd cramped shape. Went down and requested another room which they did with no fuss.The new room - 729 - was lovely. Nice and big with a large plasma TV, large bathtub and rainfall shower. There were some bad things about the room, but most were addressed quickly: No coffee/tea maker, no iron (although there was an ironing board), broken plug in the sink, leak from the bathroom window - I called guest services and everything was brought straight up and the sink and window were fixed.The bathroom is freezing. There is not heat in there at all.The turn-down service was a nice touch!The Palm Court Bar was much welocmed at the end of a long day - even thoug hit was pricey (5 pounds for a bottle of Speckled Hen and 7.50 pounds for a Frangelica) the atmosphere made up for it.The conceirge was excellent - in fact, all the staff were superb.Great location - close to the tubes (5 minute walk) and all the museums."
99,1258,"Feb 6 2009 	Unfortunatley not a 5-star hotel	This hotel has a perfect location within walking distance to Bond Street, Oxford Steet, Piccadilly Circus and Covent Garden.The rooms are spaciuos and the beds are good, but the hotel could do with a renovation. I will not call this a 5-star hotel, but maybe a 3-star. The bathroom was disguisting and freezing cold.The Palm Court bar/resturant was GREAT. Good food, excellent service and Fabio who woks there provide fantastic service to all the customers."
100,1258,"Feb 4 2009 	Sad-Sad-Sad	The hotel does not deserve 5 stars....maybe 2....it is old, the rooms are tired...the bathrooms diguesting for a 5star hotel. Everything about the accomodation is sad compared any other 5 star hotel I have stayed. The hallways are old, creaky floors that are carpeted in 70's rug. The place was shocking, the service in the lobby was of 1star quality....Okay the tea room was nice and the gym ok......would not recommend staying there are nicer 4star hotels....and the Intercontinental down the street 100% nicer with great rates too! NO VALUE for the money spent, not worth it at all!"
101,1258,Jan 23 2009	Old Old Old Lady Lane Needs Renovation	this hotel smacks of great old architecture and history but the hallways and many rooms dank old smelly bot renovation in a couple of decades or more! even the reception lobby is shocking..SHERATON wake up!!!
102,1258,"Jan 10 2009	Good Location - Tired Hotel	This hotel, in the Picadilly area. Is fine. However the room decor is quite tired, and the public areas - other than the main lounge - are even more tired. There are much better maintained and situated hotels."
103,1258,"Jan 3 2009 	Many things to like about the hotel	I come to London frequently and usually stay at the Park Lane. My december trip did not disappoint. During a 3 week period I stayed here 3 separate times and used the hotel to hold the bulk of my luggage while I was traveling outside of London. The rooms are very clean, the bed linens and mattresses comfortable and the shower pressure/ temperature excellent, plus the windows open. Some of the rooms I have stayed in have intricate art deco tilework in the baths and of course that is due to the hotel's age. I have stayed in both the executive and the small classic rooms and have been very pleased. In addition, they are now doing Jazz nights Fri/Sat in the bar area and it makes for a great evening after the theatre. I find the drinks and the bar food expensive but tasty. An ATM , the Green Park tube station and a Starbucks are 2 blocks away. Scores of excellent restaurants are behind the hotel in Shepards Market. I walked easily from the west end theatres to the hotel each night. Green Park and Buckingham Palace are across the street, Hyde Park the other other direction. My only complaint is that the bathrooms do not have outlets for blow driers nor adequate shelf space for all your stuff. Most hotels now a days make you hunt for the blow dryer and the Park Lane is no different . However, at the Park Lane, the outlets are in the bedroom and you wind up drying your hair without the benefit of a mirror. During December, this hotel is very full and its ballrooms are used for many events. Best to book as early as possible. Also, on occasion, I have noticed some errors on the hotel bill, but the staff takes care of them easily."
104,1258,Jan 2 2009 	Best New Year Ever!!!!!!!!!!!	This hotel is fab.....I dont understand why it is rated so so low on here......*Great Staff*Gorgeous Room*Fab Location*Major lovely breakfast!!! We stayed in room 811.....which had a fantasic view of the New Years Eve fireworks display. 10 minute walk to Piccadily and West end!!We hardly used the tube!!Will be booking to go back in February
105,1258,"Dec 30 2008 	Solid if uninspiring	Stayed here recently during a vacation. Hotel location is quite convenient for tourists and business travellers alike - a few minutes walk from 2 subway stations, right in the middle of London. Reception staff were courteous and efficient.The room was a bit small, but decent by London standards. Bathroom was quite spacious. The building is actually quite old - but well maintained. The room was clean, the fittings adequate. Except for the closet - for some unfathomable reason they saw fit to install the safe halfway up the closet space so that it is impossible to hang up a full length coat... or even a standard jacket for that matter.The hotel has wireless internet access available throughout its premises. Breakfast was adequate - but there will be more interesting options within a 5 minute walk.All in all, this hotel was good value - especially by London standards. Staff were efficient and courteous throughout my stay."
106,1258,"Dec 15 2008 	Not so bad	We booked a room here only as we were attending a dinner/dance at the hotel. We also had our 2 young children with us as we decided during the day to have a day out with them. We requested a room large enough for the 4 of us and a babysitter service. Before reading the reviews we were expecting 5 star luxury, then we read the reviews and started getting very worried. In fact we rang the hotel and told them our concerns, we were told not to worry , we would be upgraded and our room would be a refurbished one. I have to stay we were not disappointed we had a spacious room on the 8th floor a very large bed and a sofa bed for the kids- although was a bit rickety - housekeeping made up nicely when requested. The room was plain and simple in decoration- not tired looking, and bathroom clean and modernised. There were no tea/coffee facilities and only 1 small bottle of complimentary water. The kids had room service meals -cheaper childrens options are provided- which were actually more adut size portions- we found this was efficient and meals of good standard. Most impressive was the babysitter provided who the kids loved. I would say the hotel is not 5 star - we have stayed in far more luxurious 5 star hotels which Park lane does not match up to. 4 star is much more reasonable. But I do wonder what we may have been given if we had not rang ahead. Overall - very good, not excellent."
107,1258,"Dec 8 2008 	The worst ""5 star"" hotel ever	Appalling. First of all I would like to emphasise that I do not usually complain when staying at a 5 star hotel as in the past, I have always had a great experience bar minor issues which I let go. I would not rate The Park Lane hotel any more than a 3 star and that is being generous. Our room was extremely disappointing (104) it was so tiny it would remind you of a bedsit. The bed was barely big enough to be called a double and the headboard was only for a single bed. The bed was also pushed against the wall making it difficult to get in and out of especially during the night when one needed to get to the toilet. The bathroom was completely unsatisfactory, the tiles were cracked and the sink had a brown dirty rim. The bath was also cracked and the shower itself was hideous. When we turned it on the whole bathroom got soaked and all our towels which were hanging beside it. This was due to the shower head being totally unstable. There were no tea and coffee facilties or complimentary water which you would come to expect in a hotel of this class. We had to phone down for water and were told it would take 15 mins, 40 mins later we got the water. I got the feeling that this room hadn't been used in a while as I found a book beside the bed which was book marked, a previous breakfast order for room service dated the 15/10/08 and we were expected to use this. The television did not work either and we had to call for an engineer to come up and fix it. I decided to head down to the hotel's restaurant with my husband to have dinner and was told that they were fully booked, then the waitress advised me that if we didnt mind to sit in the lounge area she would serve us the food there. She gave us menu's and told us she would be in to take our order. We waited for 45 mins and no one came so therefore I had to go back to the restaurant with our orders. It took another hour for our meal and we only ordered two pizzas. The staff never asked either of us if we were guests of the hotel nor for our room number or to sign for any bill. We waited for a while in the lounge as we were having a few glasses of wine. No one came near us with a bill so myself and my husband got up and went back to our room completely dissatisfied with the service.  There was a ball on that evening in the hotel and it was just unfortunate that our room was located directly above this and the music was so loud it went on until 2.30 am. I complained to the duty manager the first night and he promised to have us moved to a new room the very next day which he did. The room however was described as a executive room but as far as im concerned it was a standard king room which I was expecting upon check in.  Upon checking out we also were given the wrong bill twice, it had expences on it which we didnt even know about eg a movie purchased which we didnt watch and breakfast expenses which we didnt eat. We are from Belfast and we had travelled to London for the weekend for a medical reason and we thought staying at this hotel would help take our minds off this but The Park Lane hotel let us down very badly. We will never be staying at the hotel ever again and would advise other travellers to stay elsewhere. Horrendous experience. Fawlty Towers springs to mind."
108,1258,"Nov 20 2008 	Great location good service but the fabric of the place is getting tired.	Despite its name, the Park Lane Sheraton isn't on Park Lane. Still, being on Piccadilly just opposite Green Park (and therefore Buckingham Palace) means it's in a great location. Situated between Hyde Park Corner and Green Park tube stations makes it is easy to get to (especially from London's Heathrow on the Piccadilly line), and is ideal for a base from which to explore London.Confusingly, what should be the main entrance from Piccadilly has something of a back door feel, and to get to reception you have to go through the lounge. What is the main door actually feels like a back door, due to the fact it's on an uninspiring and narrow street. That being said, once you're inside, the charm of the place soon hits you and the friendliness of the staff is welcoming.Receptionists were efficient and helpful, as indeed were pretty much all members of staff that I had contact with. The food was top notch, although not cheap. That being said, nothing out of the ordinary price-wise for London. The lounge has lots of character, and in the afternoon there was a harpist playing away whilst we were having afternoon tea. All very pleasant.What lets the place down slightly is the bedrooms seemed a little tired. Not ghastly, but the age of the place shows at times. It's a shame, as with some more money spent on this place, it could really be fantastic. As it is, it's just very good.All in all, a great location and good staff, just showing its age a little."
109,1258,"Nov 18 2008 	Location Location Location	We stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton for our wedding Anniversary. The grandeur of the hotel was impressive and its location was superb. Green Park Tube station is a just along from the hotel, but we found walking to the shops of Regent Street and Oxford Street was so simple. The staff were great and the room we were allocated was very grand and spacious. A Sunday morning walk in Regents Park was fantastic to wake us up, with Buckingham Palace just through the trees. We had a great time and we will be returning."
110,1258,"Nov 16 2008 	Not worth the SPG points...	Used 12000 Starwood Preferred Points for a one night stay at the Sheraton Park Lane and was not worth 100 points. Room was located on the first floor and was a disaster. As soon as the elevator doors open on the first floor, there is a terrible odor. As far as the room went, carpet was not clean, sheets were old and torn, toilet seat was inoperable, etc...Don't even get me started about the view we had!!! I've stayed at many Starwood properties. The Sheraton Hacienda Del Mar in Cabo and the Sheraton Panama City Convention center and the list goes on. Im very puzzled at how this property is part of Starwood when most of their properties are top notch. If you have an option to stay at another hotel in London, do that but don't waste your SPG points or money on this hotel. Nothing to do with Starwood, as they have some of the best properties in the world, but this one is not one of them."
111,1258,"Oct 29 2008	Smelly Sheraton	The Hotel is very well situated but it is badly in need of a face lift,the whole of the first floor smelled so bad, the room was a little shabby, the bathroom looked like something out of the 1930's, for the price it was very disapointing,"
112,1258,"Oct 29 2008 	Adequate but Makeover required	Booked through last minute for 129 a night room only.Hotel well located close to Green Park tube station. Grand old hotel that continues to present a grand public face in the communal areas.Room (242) however was tired and in need of modernisation. Good points - clean, large &amp; comfy bed, modern TV.Bad points - bathroom not modernised for at least 20 years. (even had old electric hair drying machines attached to wall. Bedroom decor dull. Hot and no air conditioning other than machine with pipe out of window that was effective but noisy. No t&amp;coffee making facilities. Rang &amp; asked for some - charged 11 for 2 teas. After more discussion did eventually get a tray &amp; kettle.Breakfast expensive (17 continental + 6.50 for kippers, full english cooked 21) but took so long (over 30 minutes) they waived the charge.conscierge services were however first class. Very knowledgeable, told you where to get the best deal and helpful.Still had good week-end but would ask for modernised room &amp; tea making tray if I stayed again."
113,1258,"Oct 28 2008 	Do not stay here	It was one of the most disappointing stays we have ever had. The hotel is advertised as a five star but without their main lounge/restaurant it rates as a two star. We are very seasoned world wide travellers and we have had good luck with Sheratons until this trip. The manager and staff were soooo rude and the rooms are in desperate, desperate need of updating. My family wore our clothes to bed because our suite was freezing. Three of us had to sleep in a bed because the suite which was to have had a pull out bed for our two teenagers did not have one. The Easter brunch was fabulous in their main lounge/restaurant. Location is good too but until they renovate their rooms and their staff I would not recommend this hotel. Overpriced and underdelivered.K WEdmonton, AB Canada"
114,1258,Oct 23 2008 	Terrible hotel from a starwood gold member	My wife and I booked this hotel using star points. As we are gold members the girl at check in would not upgrade us. She said we were getting an executive king. The room was dark and had a musty smell and the window faced a building about 10 feet accross. Even the toilet seat was inferior. It was wood with scratches and chipped paint. Do not accept room 654 if it is offered although I have a feeling all of the rooms are similar.The elevator had a terrible chemical smell and the hallways are worn out. I guess in comparison we had just com from the Maria Christina in San Sebastian Spain and The Westin Palace in Madrid. That being said if those are 5 star hotels this place is no more than three stars. I would say that if we were not staying here on points we would have left for a different hotel.I forgot to mention that the concierge on at night (a fellow with I think a German accent) was cluless. He didn't know anything about London.
115,1258,"Oct 9 2008 	Refurb required - tatty tired rooms!	I've stayed twice at this centrally located grand old hotel and I am the top tier of frequent stay guest with Starwood who manage this property. On both occasions I have been upgraded to junior suites. I can only imagine then what a regular room looks like because this Hotel is simply not up to the standard of a quality chain in terms of the decor and condition of it's rooms. Cracked and peeling paint work, tired beat up furniture, no robes, poor quality lighting, odd shaped rooms and battered fixtures.The beds are comfortable and clean though, but that is the only nice thing I can say about the room.Anyone traveling to London and arriving here for the first time would think we are third world, it is that bad!Ok, some positives - the staff I found to be outgoing and friendly. The main salon off the front entrance is charming and retro. The location is great.However, there are better deals at much nicer properties then this, until Starwood choose to invest and renovate this tatty place I cannot recommend it."
116,1258,"Oct 4 2008 	Fantastic beds - pity about the rest of the room!	What a disappointment! We booked the hotel because the location was perfect, but we got a nasty shock when we arrived at our room. It was dark, drab and dreary. There were not even any tea &amp; coffee making facilities, which are usually provided everywhere - even at the most humble B&amp;Bs! The bathroom was long and thin and very old-fashioned. To add insult to injury, there was a note saying &quot;Congratulations, you have been upgraded&quot;. From what, I wonder? Surely a 5-star hotel cannot possibly have rooms inferior to the one we were given!The one saving grace was the bed - it was, without doubt, the most comfortable that I have ever slept on. So much so that I shall seriously consider buying one from the Sheraton website.We went there for a special occasion and felt very let down. We shall not be returning."
117,1258,"Sep 28 2008 	Nice Sheraton Glad I got a deal	I was in town on business for just one night and didn't arrive to the hotel until after midnight after my work event. I was promptly checked in and immediately ordered room service when I got to my room as i'd missed dinner. I'm always surprised how long it takes, even when you order at a time when the kitchen shouldn't be busy. Luckily it wasn't too long -- I would say about 30 minutes, but still, for a chicken sandwich, I would think they could get it up to me in 15 min at that hour.The room itself was fine, the bedding was nice and the room wasn't large, but definitely not too small, especially since I was travelling by myself. I've stayed at the Le Meridien Picadilly which has not mastered the art of maintaining the &quot;London feel&quot; or Victorian style of the rooms without making it look old and dated, but this Sheraton did a much better job. The shower was an older style, but actually worked fine for my needs.The only other problem was they couldnt figure out how to add my husband's SPG number to the reservation, finally I got it from my husband the next day and called them and they were able to add it.Overall, I was pretty happy with my stay. The location is good and the room was nice. My dinner was good enough, but I did have quite a few drinks that night so anything probably would've tasted good. Best of all though, is I booked this hotel for 129 on last minute as part of their &quot;Top Secret&quot; hotel that they dont' show you until after you've made your booking. I was definitely happy about that and when I checked on their website, the same room was going for 219... definitely a deal!"
118,1258,"Sep 21 2008 	One of the best hotels I've stayed in	I don't know if we got lucky because Starwood points were used to book our rooms, but I've stayed in a few really nice hotels in the United States/Canada and this one is definitely in my top 10. Never having been to Europe, I expected small, pretty sparse rooms based on all that I have read and the Park Lane was above and beyond this expectation. The hotel staff was really friendly and accommodating since our flight the day before had been cancelled and we ended up checking in at 9 a.m. a day late. They were helpful in getting us setup with an electrical adapter and fixing our TV.The location is great and we were able to run across Green Park to try and catch the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace that morning (although they never changed the guard while we were there :-( ). Just up the street from Piccadilly Circus and other tourist sights.The rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms were absolutely fantastic. We had connecting rooms on a corner and both had whirlpool tubs and separate shower stalls. Plenty of room for all of us to spread out, clean and a very pleasant respite after all of our travel difficulties to get there."
119,1258,Sep 20 2008 	Great Location.	My friends and I choosed the Sheraton Parklane because the location was really good. I heard some of the rooms where renovated and very nice. I guess we were not lucky enough to get an upgrade. The size of the room was big but overall okay. The room was just old. We were out all day so it was okay. The hotel is at a great location. It was so easy for us to go anywhere. Would I stay here again? I will when I get a good deal. But I think next time I will try out the Sheraton Park Tower or The Lanesborough which are near by the Parklane.
120,1258,"Aug 31 2008 	More shabby than chic	We have just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We thought that it would be excellent as its location was so desirable, but the experience was marred by the condition of the rooms which we felt were not value for money. The small room we had, typical of many in the hotel, was dwarfed by a larger than average bed and the furnishings cluttered up the rest of the space. The view from the window revealed a wall of windows opposite. The bathroom was long, thin and with ancient fittings - not antique, just old. A small old enamel bath and unstable shower attachment were complemented by a two layer shower curtain which was bent on attacking the occupant when in use. The waste bin in the bathroom was broken but replaced when we reported it, but not so the plumbing which made a loud cacophony of noise when the amenities were used! The room was dark and shabby. I think that guests are meant to interpret this kind of space as elegant or retro in some way, but it was drab accommodation. A burn in the throw over the bed was unattractive, and the fact that we had paid a similar amount of money for two previous excellent stays in the Manchester Hilton and The Lowry Hotel just threw the different standards into relief. We were not afforded any complimentary tea/coffee or newspapers and are saddened that this poor value for money was to be found in the heart of our capital city.Service staff, breakfasts, public areas etc were fine, but otherwise I would not recommend this hotel."
121,1258,Aug 28 2008 	Average Hotel - Nothing Special except for their beds	First off - I used my starpoints for this hotel. We arrived at the front desk which was small but well staffed. The front desk was very quick and easy check in. I didn't care if they were super friendly or not - just get the check in correct. They had a king at 11A ready - no view. The lobby is beautiful and so are the dining and lounge areas - very classic. The elevators are very small and SLOW! The hallways are very OLD and creaky when walking on it. The room was very old - the bathroom - sheesh - like 30 years old without any renovation. Rooms are a bit small too. The plus? Fantastic location and the bed was super comfy and super clean! Concierge was non caring and recommendation for lunch was horrible! The bar staff was very helpful and friendly - I needed hot water to make milk for my baby and they were fast and helpful. Check out was also super fast. Another note - the hotel is NOT stroller friendly! Just an FYI as many US hotels have to have ramps or elevators - we did not see that in this hotel. Well - those are my comments. Hope it helps.
122,1258,"Aug 28 2008 	Fabulous Hotel	We had read some negative reviews about the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel and were somewhat concerned, however the location was perfect so we gave it a try. I must say we were more than pleased. The room was a bit larger than european standards in older hotels, we had a view of Hyde Park, the bathroom was well appointed and quite large. They staff were very professional and went out of their way to make sure you had everything you needed. They extra touches you would expect from this hotel were definately there. The location could not be beat. Right by the tube with a direct connection to Heathrow. We will be back!"
123,1258,Aug 25 2008 	Sheraton Park Lane	Small room-worn decor.
124,1258,"Aug 24 2008 	Worst Sheraton Ever...	My family stayed at the Park Lane for a week, at the end of June. The staff are ok, but the property needs a serious overhaul. Stains, holes in the wall, a toilet that didn't work (even after maintenance &quot;fixed it&quot;), all were disappointing. I didn't receive a newspaper, even thought the front desk asked me if I wanted one when I checked in. We used points, otherwise I would have been even more disappointed. The price of the room, as well as the restaurant and bar, are quite high.The location is great, but that's about all you can say for it. Not sure who's bright idea it was to put the &quot;Front Desk&quot; at the back of the hotel. When you come in off of Piccadilly you have to go through the bar to get to the check-in and the elevators.I have stayed at dozens of Starwood properties, and I can easily say that this is the worst one, by a long shot.I won't stay here again, until I hear they've renovated."
125,1258,"Aug 19 2008 	I didn't want to leave and can't wait to go back!	If you don't collect Starwood point, I would highly recommend you do if ONLY to stay at this wonderful hotel on the points. Rooms are very pricey and way out of my league. I was traveling with my family (7 of us in total) so we enjoyed 3 rooms, all EXCELLENT. We all decided that Park Lane has the best bathrooms ever! All marble tile with full size tubs, separate showers, double sinks and wonderful amenities. The rooms were oversize, spotless and spacious. Beds were the usual Sharaton superb standard. But as wonderful as the rooms were, the staff was amazing. The doorman was a dream as was the rest of the front lobby team. Location of this hotel is handy to everything. We all would highly recommend this hotel!"
126,1258,"Aug 15 2008 	Good rooms 	I stayed here for one night in early August. I have stayed here before; never with problems in the past.The check-in/out desk is friendly &amp; efficient.Location is fabulous, very central &amp; within 5mins walking of the Tube.The rooms are adequate; nothing special but fine. Comfortable beds, decent TV, fairly spacious (certainly by London standards). However, it was hot while I was there &amp; the air conditioning was not working well.i was tired after a long day &amp; ordered room service. It took longer than 30 minutes; I was not offered the 'discount' for it being late &amp; the food was VERY bland. I also suffered stomach problems almost exactly 6 hours after the meal; possibly a co-incidence but I am not sure ..."
127,1258,"Jul 28 2008 	Good location and service	We chose the Park Lane Hotel in order to use our points earned by using our credit card in the Starwood program. That is to say it didn't cost us money. That being said, we liked the hotel. We got a large room on the 8th (top) floor, which didn't have much of a view but was spacious and comfortable. The furnishings, however, seemed somewhat dated. The bathroom was large and clean.You really can't beat the location. The hotel is on Piccadilly between the Green Park and Hyde Park underground stations, which was convenient for us because it is a direct line from Heathrow airport and access major tourist sites. On our first morning we walked across the street to Green Park and then to central Westminster, past Buckingham Palace, etc.The ground floor has a pleasant lounge with some decent jazz music on weekend nights. We never ate at the hotel restaurant, opting instead to investigate the Shephard's Market area just around the corner. There we found two reasonably priced places for breakfast, some good restaurants and two or three good, atmospheric pubs.If not for our points, however, I don't know if we would have stayed here. It seems a bit above our budget. But for using points, it was great."
128,1258,"Jul 24 2008 	Is a kettle really too much to expect?!	My boyfriend booked us in for a night to celebrate his birthday. We got a deal on lastminute.com; the 'top secret' hotel section, which we had used before, with very good results, so I was anticipating a little luxury after looking at some of the online photos of the hotel.I have to say we were disappointed with our room. We had booked a double, which on closer inspection turned out to be twin beds pushed together (almost but not enough to avoid the inevitable gap in the middle) - not a great aid to romance. The room inself was dark and rather shabby (especially the bathroom, where the shower was archaic, not working properly and we resorted to using the (tiny) bath instead. For me however, the most surprising downside was the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the room. When I rang to ask reception where they were, I was told I could order hot drinks from room service. Surely, it is is not unreasonable to expect to be able to have this facility in a four star hotel? Even the lowliest guest houses and two stars I have frequented have managed to provide this for their guests. Since we had booked room only and no breakfast, I had to wait till check out to get a much longed for cup of tea or coffee. All in all, I would advise caution with this hotel. Don't expect a luxurious room. Ok, the bar looks posh, but other than that, it was quite disappointing."
129,1258,"Jul 22 2008	Excellent location ok rooms	My wife and I spent 2 nights at the Park Lane in late May and we had a wonderful time. We were at the end of a 4 week trip to Europe and it was nice relaxing place to stay. The location was very good - within easy walking distance of more sites than we could see during the time that we were there. We had no problems getting there from Heathrow, the check-in was quick and friendly, and the room was small but comfortable. We had read other reviews before we arrived and were not sure what to expect. I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. Our room was on the first floor (2nd in north america) and was 2 rooms in from the Picadilly side (facing the other wing). It was clean, quiet, a little crowded with the huge bed, and the bathroom was clean but small. The lobby bar is amazing - we started each day there with coffee or an English breakfast and we finished each night listening to the live music. We felt that is was a good value for the money (London is a very expensive place to visit) and we are planning to stay at the Park Lane on our next trip to London."
130,1258,"Jun 29 2008 	Good Location Good Service Bad Rooms	Stay: May 24 - May 29, 2007Room: Executive RoomUpgrades: Room (from Classic Room), Late CheckoutComments: Everything that you have heard about the Park Lane is probably true. I spent more time trying to decide on where to stay in London than the rest of our trip combined. For starters, if you take the Tube, you are going to have to walk quite a bit with your luggage to the hotel. And remember, the lobby is at the back. We of course, were too tired and frustrated (all luggage was delayed an hour) to remember, so we had to drag our luggage up and down stairs and around quite a few corners. The gentleman working at the desk, Rajiv, was EXTREMELY helpful though. When I asked about an upgrade (even though this was a Priceline stay) he spent about 10 minutes looking for something and eventually settled on an Executive Room after night 1. We were never so happy to hear that after we saw our initial room. Gross is the single word I would use to describe it. The carpet, walls and baseboards were black from dirt and use. No AC. The bathroom was only wide enough for one person at a time. This was exactly what I feared about paying $400 a night through *wood.Luckily the next day our luggage was moved to an Executive Room, which was obviously refurbished more recently. The walls and floors were cleaner, but still not what I would call 3* here in the States, and the bathroom was updated. A better value for the Priceline price I paid ($200 a night), but if I went through *wood as was my initial intention, I would've shot somebody. My wife was never comfortable walking on the floor without her socks the entire stay.The concierge did recommend us a VERY good Indian restaurant past Piccadilly Circus and was helpful. Relatively, it is close to 2 different Tube stations, but the entrance off of the back alley is mind boggling. The noise from the lobby/bar IS a problem if you are on a floor lower than the 4th. Suffice it so say, next time I will be staying someplace else, since IMHO, *wood has nothing reasonable in the city.It being London, you really cannot complain since everything in the city is crazy expensive for us over here. The location was good walking distance to whatever we wanted and the 2 Tube stations was good for our longer jaunts. Still, there are other hotels, non-*wood, that are a much better bang for your buck in the city."
131,1258,Jun 23 2008	Never again	You could not pay me to stay at this hotel again. You would think being situated on Park Lane this Starwood hotel would be some sort of flagship.....absolutely the opposite. Quite honestly the worst Starwood Hotel I have stayed in.
132,1258,"Jun 23 2008 	Good Points and Bad Points	I have just come back from a very enjoyable weekend in London and stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane Hotel. I had read previous reviews and dont agree its all bad as some say. There are good points such as location - 10 mins walk from Knightsbridge, Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace - Two tube stops away from Oxford Street. There bar area is amazing not in a modern sense more in an old grandour way and each night there was a jazz band playing. Bad points all relate to the room - they were drab and dark and the bathroom was tiny with no space for your toiletries and you could not turn in the shower. If I was staying again I would ask for a room with a bigger bathroom."
133,1258,"Jun 19 2008 	You get what you pay for	Due to the many negative views posted about this hotel I would like to give my perspective.I didn't go for the cheapest rate - I booked an executive room costing 245 GBP per night. From people' responses I believe it is worth spending that extra money.On the morning of my stay I telephoned the hotel asking for the earliest check-in time with a view of Green Park. The customer service was excellent, and I was given the room of my choice.It was large, including huge bed, desk, arm chair, chest of drawers and walk-in wardrobe. The bathroom was large with great walk-in shower, bath and WC. The view from the 8th floor was amazing.Take my advice - don't go with the cheapest rate - and be prepared to ring the hotel and request the best."
134,1258,"Jun 17 2008 	Very Disappointed not again at this price.	Very disappointed on the Sheraton Park Lane, unfortunately, it really is a bit of a dive. Don't look at the picture on the website. The reality is that the hotel is actually on a bus lane so you don't get dropped off at the front door. You go round the back and up the sort of seedy back street that most people would avoid walking up if they could.The whole ethos of the hotel is a pretty shabby dated and old hotel that obviously had it's day back in the 1960's.The room was totally bland, bare, characterless and although I wouldn't say it was dirty in an unhygenic way, it just seemed as though it needed a good clean.Wireless internet access in my room was intermittent at best, despite moving around the room for a signal (and paying 18!!).The bathroom was about 4 foot wide. I couldn't actually get an angle to get a photo of the shower as it was basically hidden around the corner behind the door.As 1960's plumbing, that hadn't been updated in nearly 50 years it made an absolute racket. Was woken up by someone, somewhere, having a shower at 5.30. It could have almost been in my room, the noise was so loud.Room 269, wireless internet 18 and VAT 47.08 makes the room 334.08 (or at todays rate just over $650). The hotel is priced at the same sort of levels as other hotels in the area, but is just incomparable in terms of service, look or comfort.For 150 a night it would be acceptable. At this price, I'll never stay here again."
135,1258,"Jun 17 2008 	Outstanding service comforts of home.	This Sheraton is now our favorite hotel in London!We stayed twice at the Sheraton Park Lane, with one week in between the stays.The front desk staff are friendly and very accomodating. Our two rooms were large and comfortable. The furniture in one of them was new. The Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed was so comfortable... it was hard getting out of bed!The location is excellent, across from Hyde Park and within walking distance from Buckingham Palace. It is only about 1.5 blocks from the original Hard Rock Cafe, and convenient to the Tube.Room service was prompt and friendly. The Afternoon Tea is award-winning, and definitely worth a visit. The tea, scones, sandwiches and petit fours were very memorable as we enjoyed live harp music.The bath robes in the rooms were a great touch. The only thing I would update would be the TV set, which was a bit small. We had such a great stay both visits (with welcome gifts compliments of the hotel) -- this will definitely be our first choice hotel in London."
136,1258,"May 27 2008 	My room was great	Very mixed reviews for this hotel. That suggests that some rooms are good and some are bad. I guess I lucked out, but maybe it's because I did not go for a bargain rate. My room was large, with a wonderful view of Piccadilly and Green Park. The bathroom was also large, with a separate shower, large tub, and double sinks, all in marble. Even a bidet for those who are into that sort of thing! The lobby is not very impressive, but the location is ideal and the price was reasonable by London standards (GBP 269/night plus 17.5% VAT).I had a little trouble finding the registration desk when I first arrived (they certainly don't make it obvious). The motor entrance is on Brick Street, but if you are walking from the Green Park underground stop (I took the Piccadilly line from Heathrow), go in the first entrance on Piccadilly and head all the way to the back (stay to the right). You may feel like you are crashing a wedding party or corporate event, but don't let that bother you. Registration is at the rear of the building near the Brick Street entrance. You can walk down Brick street as well, but it's a little indirect and not particularly pedestrian friendly.Overall an extremely pleasant stay, thanks to the nice room."
137,1258,"May 11 2008 	Great location but definitely worn around the edges	Just returned from a quick weekend in London, and stayed at the Park Lane. My rate was around US$300 per night. The comments many previous posters have written about the Park Lane are not far off from the mark. For the amount of money being charged for this hotel, I would have expected a little more. While my room did not have worn carpet, the furnishings were a bit old. And, as other posters have stated, the room was pretty small (and being a Starwood elite, I was apparently upgraded, too). I overlooked the backside of another wing of the hotel (make sure you close the drapes). The bathroom was outfitted in white and grey marble, and offers a reminder of traditional Britishness. The towel-warming rack wonderful. However, the toilet was a bit dirty (I don't even want to describe it).The hotel has this general old-ness feel to it. I can't quite describe what I mean by &quot;old-ness.&quot; It's not the upper crust, gilded age of Britain, but it's not decrepit either. It kind of reminds me of the old, Soviet Union tourist hotels from the 1980s. It has a generally worn, slightly neglected feeling to it.That being said, the location of the Park Lane is hard to beat. (If you read my other posts on tripadvisor, you'll quickly see that location is a huge selling point for me.) It's located across from Green Park and near Hyde Park. It's mid-way between the Green Park and Hyde Park Corner tube stations (each about a 5 to 10 minute walk away). It's a quick ride to Picadilly Circus, Westminster Station (for the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben), Waterloo Station (for the London Eye), and Knightsbridge (for Harrod's). Buckingham Palace is a 10 minute walk away, too. The Park Lane is located in the Mayfair area of London, which is a nicer area, and home to many of the foreign embassies. It also has lots of nice little hole-in-the wall pubs (that are not full of tourists).The bellmen and concierge were very helpful, and always offered a friendly greeting and great advice on sights and restaurants. As a note, if you're taking the Heathrow Express into Paddington, it's about a US$25 cab ride (including tip) to the Park Lane. So, if you have the cash to spend (and mind you, London is really, really expensive for Americans these days), and you want a good hotel in a good location, pick the Park Lane Hotel. Just keep in mind that US$300 doesn't get you much in London anymore."
138,1258,"May 7 2008 	Very dissapointing	I read some good reviews of this hotel on lastminute.com, and the description was quite nice. Since it was listed as a 4 star hotel and since Sheraton has a good name in my book, I was expecting a more luxiourius room. How dissapointing! The room was tiny; furniture in bad condition; doors not closing properly; bathroom could not be locked; air conditioning not functioning to standard; a layer of dust in the bathroom; a puddle of water around the toilet after flushing; the mini bar just ripped out; uncomfortable sagging bed...not my idea of a romantic weekend. The check in staff was unfriendly as well + the price of drinks in the bar outrageous! My advice: Don't go here...there are cheaper rooms in much nicer hotels available in this area."
139,1258,"May 2 2008 	Is this really the same place???	Decided as it was our silver wedding anniversary this week - to revisit the Sheraton Park Lane as we had stayed for our honeymoon what seems like many years before!On checking tripadviser really thought this would be a big mistake but our daughter insisted that it wouldn't be the same if we stayed at a different hotel. SO GLAD I LISTENED TO HER. On arrival I told a very sweet trainee receptionist why we were here and check in was great - no problems whatsoever - straight to our room - no problems whatsoever - clean, lovely bathroom, walk in shower, walk in wardrobe - yes it looked out onto Brick Street - but I hadn't booked it for the view. The whole stay was first class and I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone - we have travelled all over the world in the last 25 years - some bad some good hotels but I really can't see what all the fuss is about, breakfast was excellent, service second to none, palm court bar fab it not a bit pricey but hey you are in the centre of London here and location is PERFECT. We loved it - thank you Sheraton Park Lane for making our silver wedding anniversary wonderful!"
140,1258,"Apr 21 2008	Horrific hotel which you could not pay me to stay in again.	I have never been so disappointed with a hotel. When I arrived I was given a tiny room with old and tattered furniture. The bathroom looked like it had not been refurbed since the 1960s. It seemed relatively clean. However, when I turned the heated towel rail on in the bathroom black gunge shot out of it, all over the place. I complained and was moved to a marginally larger room with the same standard of furnishings - except in this bathroom the bath was chipped all over and there wasn't even a mixer tap! I was also offered a complimentary breakfast the next morning. When I went for a shower it turned out that the shower head was broken. An engineer promptly came to fix it, however even when fixed this did not stop the water from the shower cascading all over the bathroom leading to a pool 3 inches deep! When my morning call failed to materialise the next day meaning that I couldn't get my complimentary breakfast AND was late for work, I complained again and was moved to an executive room. No problems with this one other than old tired furnishings which need to be updated - the bathroom seemed to have been refurbed although one of the taps would not stop dripping. This is allegedly a high quality hotel from a major international brand in one of the most prestigious addresses in London. Sheraton should be ashamed. I was informed that they intend to run a major refurb project in the near future but this is overdue by at least 5 years! I would NEVER stay here again, and would be tempted to avoid any Sheraton brand hotels if at all possible."
141,1258,"Apr 18 2008 	Reliable Good and Well-located.	I treval frequently to London and stay at the Park Lane each time. As a way of reference, I've already had three stays this year and am headed back in two weeks time. Many of the reviews suffer from inflated expectations due to inaccurate ratings. Obviously this isn't a five star hotel, and it should be classified as such. So the fact that people show up there expecting a five star experience immediately puts both parties in a bad place.What the Park Lane is is a very well located hotel, with good, reliable service and -- stated bluntly -- mediocre rooms. I am part of the Preferred Guest program so I obviously stay there to capitalize on rewards, however, I've also come to appreciate the old-world British appeal of the place as well.Many of the rooms could use a rehab, and the quality I get on a visit by visit basis is often frustratingly inconsistent. However, if you're willing to overlook a bit of a tatter or miscolor in the carpet, or some cracks in the bathroom tile, you'll find this gets outweighed by generally helpful and efficient staff, a very nice bar and bartenders and a proxmity to parks, picadilly, tubes etc etc. On many occasions, the staff have bent over backwards to help -- for instance giving me a tiny room of my own to wait in until my own room was ready, etc. I've never had anyone be anything but friendly, as a matter of fact. I'm always greeted courteously and professionally. It's one of the reasons I'm willing to overlook a few deficiencies.Hope this helps clarify a bit of the negatives I've read. They are clearly a result of this hotel being nischaraterized. It's not five star, but it's defnitely not a bad place, either. Happy to answer any questions. Just send along a note."
142,1258,"Apr 15 2008 	Don't waste your money!	I took my partner to this hotel for our anniversary last weekend and can honestly say we were very disappointed. It is advertised as 5* on Hotels.com so i was therefore expecting something pretty special. Yes it's a great location but instead of a park view we could only see a grey wall out of our window! Our room was very small and the bathroom dated, with a shower attachment as opposed to a power shower. On arrival, we were behind a large group trying to check in and let's just say the man checking them in was not the friendliest chap i've ever met. He was fairly rude to them to be honest. As soon as i walked into my room, my gut instinct was to go back to reception and ask for an alternative room but the guy's attitude left me with a sneaking suspicion that wouldn't be possible! It wasn't a complete disaster. The staff in the bar/restaurant were very nice but at 200 a night, i'm sure there are much better places to stay in London"
143,1258,Apr 3 2008	disappointed in the Sheraton Park Lane	Very disappointed in this hotel and my stay there - many rooms look into the back of an apartment building rather than Green Park as advertised so most guests were down at the front desk battling for changes - Green Park entrance does not have a doorman so we were stuck dragging all our luggage through the restaurant and up the stairs - fitness center was poorly equipped and water was out and tv did not work - soiled towels and sheets in our rooms were not changed - bottled water in our room was not restocked - cable tv in a room was out with little to no explanation - other than the concierge staff was generally not pleasant - all in all a two to three star experience rather than five star experience.
144,1258,"Mar 26 2008 	Dreadful awful and miserable  dont waste you money.	I did not book this hotel myself, it was offered as an alternative from Octopus Travel after they had taken a booking from me for another hotel, which was later reported as over booked. I had to make a quick decision about the swap as there was very little availability so took the advice from the assistant. On arrival I was left for 10 minutes at the desk while the receptionist was sorting something out, without a word. We booked a triple room and it seemed that they only had one double room left. An extra bed would have to be arranged. When we opened the room door we were so disappointed. It was so small, dingy and the bathroom had seen better days. I went back to the desk and explained that I was not satisfied and in fact was very embarrassed as I had my 85 year old mother with me on a special visit to London. Nothing could be offered so I just had to stay. We booked and paid for the Continental breakfast as part of our stay. This was another huge disappointment. The breakfast room was situated in a worn out corner of the hotel with the buffet stuffed in another unsuitable space. They did not even have any white bread available and the array of eatables was off putting. Dont let the location or address of this so called hotel draw you into thinking that it has something to offer it doesnt. It did not even provide a tea making facility in the room. We had to order 2 teas at a cost of 11.00 from room service. This is just an unprofessionally run hotel with money making as its engine  it has nothing to do with the service industry it is part of. Overall this hotel is just a big mistake. May I add that I am a very fair person and do not set out to find fault but this experience deserves the truth. I hope other visitors will not have their holidays ruined due to the lack of any true professionalism from such a large organisation as the Sheraton."
145,1258,"Mar 25 2008	Terrible Room Condition Good Location Not Honoring Upgrades	The condition of the room was horrible with hallways after hallways leading to a dead end to make you think you actually got a corner room that maybe slightly bigger than usual. Wrong, the rooms are so small and old that you can hardly see sunlight. The TVs are some of the smallest of its kind in this hotel class, roughly 19&quot;. The furniture was from the 80's with narrow walkways around your bed and that's pretty much all the space there is left in the room.The truth is half of the rooms are not facing to the park contrary to the hotel name. Many of the rooms were actually facing each other that you could almost reach out of the window to shake hands with the people staying across from you. Here's the worse part, I booked it using Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy class referral with a guaranteed double upgrade at the time of booking. The hotel didn't honor that. With the price that I paid(over 200 pounds a day), I could have stayed at a much better hotel. Internet access is charged at 19 pounds a day. That's almost US$40 a day."
146,1258,"Mar 19 2008 	Great location so-so accommodations	The main entrance to the hotel is extremely impressive but the rooms just don't match that grandeur. My room was on the second floor and a good size compared to the rooms of some of the other people I travelled with. The bathroom was clean and spacious, but the pedestal sink didn't provide enough counterspace for all my girly toiletries. As someone else mentioned, when showering the shower curtain would not stay put and kept blowing in and sticking to me, which is pretty repulsive. I ordered room service one night and the fellow who takes the orders sounded like he was on some kind of drugs. The food was absolutely not worth the price, and when I called room service to have my cart taken away nobody ever showed p. Other than that I don't really have any complaints about this place. The price is pretty high for the hotel's condition, but its location makes up for it. If you've got the cash I'd probably recommend the Dorchester a few blocks away."
147,1258,"Mar 19 2008 	This Hotel is a Joke	This hotel should be ashamed of itself. The location is the only good thing about the hotel. They have a few good rooms but most have stained dirty carpet furniture and drapes. Walls and ceilings peeling. The control panel on the main elevator was loose and hanging from the elevator wall. The Bar/lounge area off the lobby smelled like a gas leak and we noticed a light flashing on the exterior of the building. Several hours later our room which was several stories above the lounge smelled of gas also. We had maintenance come up and the tech said there has been a mystery gas smell throughout the hotel in spots. He allowed that the flashing light was connected to the problem, He advised us to open the window. When I complained about my room to the night manager she was extremely rude. This hotel seems to have no NO STANDARDS and is a joke. Don't waste your money or Starpoints on this dump!"
148,1258,Mar 14 2008 	I Love it	I had to write this review based on what was written by others. We had read the reviews before going and thought we would be sadly disappointed however we were not in the least. When we arrived we had explained to the check in person that we would be staying for 6 nights and that we wanted to be comfortable. She offered us to look at one room and when doing this I could see where people could be upset but we went back down and told her that we didn't care for that one and she told us that a larger room was going to be opening up in about an hour. We went for lunch (they held our luggage) and came back to a wonderful room. It was huge. The bathroom was wonderful. It had a bathtub to take baths in and then a walk in shower with a rain head. We had breakfast that was included with our package however if it was not we would have eaten at one of the little cafes near by. The location was good. I don't have one complaint about this establishment at all. I think if you ask before checking in you are better off instead of just taking what is given to you.
149,1258,"Mar 2 2008 	Good Location - Not Good Value - Beware of phone charges	The Park Lane Sheraton is located close to many tourist attractions (e.g. Buckingham Palace). Only a 5 minute walk from the Green Park underground Tube station off of the Piccadilly line makes it easy to get to from Heathrow Airport since you don't have to change. Let me preface this review by saying that this hotel has managed to hit three of my pet peeves. If you don't care about these issues, this hotel can be OK, albeit not at a bargain basement price. You won't find me going back to this property.1) As a Sheraton Platinum member, there is no executive lounge, and no complementary breakfast for Platinum members. 2) They have one of the most expensive phone charges for dialing the local U.K. toll free numbers -- 0800 xxxxx. I made two &quot;toll free&quot; 0800 calls and spent ?16 or about $32 US Dollars. It could have been much worse!3) When I complained, the staff really didn't care, and when I mentioned that I would never stay at this property again, they said, &quot;I am sorry to hear that&quot;. My sense was that it really didn't matter to them. The hotel is fairly typical of an older property. It is 8 stories high, and my room was fairly large. The shower and bath were probably updated a while ago -- but it was very functional. In addition, the window in the main bedroom opened to the outside (a plus for cool fresh air) and there were double windows to reduce the outside noise (another plus). The heating/cooling controls did not work, thus the value of having windows that open. Location wise, this is a high tourist area and it is next to the Hard Rock Cafe. Many tourist attractions are nearby and the location of the tube is only 5 minutes away. Right next to the Sheraton is another local hotel and just around the corner is the Hilton and Four Seasons. As I travel quite a bit, I do use the local 0800 numbers. I am used to paying about ?1 to ?2 for an access charge. This I find to be &quot;normal&quot; and typical. This property charges you per minute to access the 0800 toll free numbers, with a &quot;cap&quot; per call of ?10. So if you are going to use the phone for five or six calls, you can literally spend ?50 or $100 dollars. As it turned out, I spent ?16 or $32, which I find ....well outside the realm of reasonable. The bigger issue is that when I complained, the desk really did not care. When I said that I was platinum, and that I wouldn't stay at this property again due to this, they didn't care. At the end of the day, charging a huge phone bill on top of a ?200 room, and then not caring when your customers are unhappy makes it so that I cannot recommend this property to others -- if you care about these issues. There are perfectly acceptable hotels just around the corner."
150,1258,"Feb 28 2008 	Depends on luck..	The quality of the rooms at this Sheraton property varies considerably, so your experience here will depend on which room you are assigned. We have been here a few times and have stayed in a number of rooms, some better than others. Our visits have been using Starwood points or paid for by my husband's employer; this is not a property I would spend my own money on. In London there are better options in the same price range. On our most recent stay the room was ordinary, with no view - an older motel style room in atmosphere. (This was a points stay). However, it did have the comfortable Sheraton beds. The safe did not work, and after we complained they gave us a complimentary breakfast, which was nice. We have had better rooms here, however, even overlooking Green Park, and even when using Starwood points. We also have had worse rooms. On one notable occasion our original suite was very hot and stuffy due to an unaccustomed London heatwave, the airconditioning was not working, so we were moved very late at night to a room way up high in the hotel (maybe where the maids used to live) which was less than mediocre indeed , but all they had available for that night. Even the room we eventually ended up in that time was hot, although the A/C worked; it was so hot that they had to bring in a fan as well. This is probably not a hotel to stay in if it is summer, as it will be very uncomfortable.We've had breakfast a few times here, it is expensive and done better elsewhere. Likewise drinks and coffee in the Palm Court lounge. (For a cheaper breakfast option you can get carryout coffee and croissants from a number of places nearby.) However, both the Palm Court lounge and the beautiful art deco Silver Ballroom are definitely worth looking at; they have been in several movies and TV shows.Location is excellent, Green Park tube is close, and the interesting Shepherds Market area has lots of restaurants. We like El Pirata tapas restaurant, just round the corner, and Sofra for Middle Eastern food, a bit further away. As other reviewers have noted, the lobby is at the back of the hotel in an alley, but cabbies know this and should drop you off there. It is interesting to stay here, in a former Park Lane Mansion, really worth putting up with the quirks of the hotel for the experience. So long as you are using Starwood points, or your company pays, or you get a very good deal."
151,1258,"Feb 26 2008	Tiny room and Preferred Guest insult	If you are thinking of booking this hotel, please be aware that you are paying your well earned money on the address but not the quality of the place.I was in room 145 which is a Classic Room. Its very small, dark and the bathroom is something out of a museum! I mean hand held shower and basin that is from the 1970's or earlier! The bed is very comfortable as it is in all Sheratons. On the morning of departure, I asked for a slightly later check out, I suggested maybe 1 or 2 pm instead of the 12pm usual check out. The Receptionist said it was possible, Great! but then with the next breathe she said, we charge 15 per hour. What a way to treat a Preferred Guest of Starwood Hotels.The place for a coffee or afternoon tea is the lovely Palm Court Lounge, very nice but if you go for the afternoon tea it costs 24.00 per person.On the whole, it's dated, overpriced and you can get more luxury, paying a lot less. Starwood will not have a repeat customer there."
152,1258,"Feb 24 2008 	Great location but dirty rooms	I used 12k Starwood points to stay at the Park Lane Shearton Feb 2008 and had an overall bad experience. Although the staff was very nice and accomodating, the rooms very very dated, carpet very old and looked dirty, very small tv with horrible reception and awful shower. The bathroom was clean, but old and the shower curtain would not stay put- it kept sticking to my body which is just disgusting. The bed was new and was a 2 twins together to make a king- very comfortable and clean. However, overall, the rooms need a major renovation or remodel. The keys to the room are the old style punch cards....not that it matters, but even those are old! The location of this hotel is awesome, but it's not worth staying here. The Sheraton Park Tower just a few blocks away is much much nicer and worth the extra money or points. I was extremely disappointed to waste my hard earned 12k points on this dirty feeling and old hotel."
153,1258,"Feb 12 2008 	Don't go here if you want luxury.	A night in this hotel with theatre tickets was a Christmas present from our daughter. The Sound of Music was fantastic. Sadly the hotel was not. We have stayed in better 3* hotels.As has been said by others, the fabric of the hotel is faded and shabby and all the bathrooms need gutting. No shower in a 5* hotel? And the enamel on the bath was coming off, the curtains were tatty and there was no in-room safe. On the plus side the bed was huge and comfortable, and the room was big enough.The TV and fridge were also old and dated and not exactly state of the art! For these prices I expected at least a power shower, plasma screen etc.Breakfast was good but at 21.50 each, it should be."
154,1258,"Feb 12 2008 	Great Location but 3 star at best!	Stayed here withmy mother and friends in Jan 08 for a concert and weekend shopping trip. Expected great things but the hotel let us down in most areas.For starters this is not a 3 star, don't go there expecting what you'd get in other Sheratons coz its really basic in comparison.The staff were really great but everything else about the hotel was shabby and bland. Common areas were so shabby and in major need of renovations. Our room walls were so thin we had to move after one night because of noise outside. We were moved to room with a view over park which was great and the staff were lovely about it. The rooms are ok, beds are super and very comfy. The bathrooms are really really bad, very old and a bit smelly!!! I cannot tell you how much they need updating, they are like something you'd find in an airport motel. The room service breakfast was appalling, very expensive and such a letdown.Everything about this hotel was a letdown but the location is unbeatable, right on piccadilly practically, no need for the tube at all. If I was going again, I'd stay at the Atheneum next door, its amazing and most certainly a 5 star, the Park lane is absolutely not, don't book it will only dissappoint!!"
155,1258,"Jan 31 2008	How odd...	Was thrilled when I got this hotel on priceline, only $200, when it was going for over $400. I'm an SPG member, and even thought they don't typically give points for priceline stays, I received them and was put on the SPG floor. Room was fine, nice linens, but nothing exceptional. The weird thing is, the Park Lane has no lobby to speak of! I had to wrestle with a bell hop to take my own luggage; I've never seen someone so persistent to wrench my suitcases from my hands, especially when I hadn't even checked in yet! But, overall it wasn't a bad experience, especially for the price. Location is extremely busy; right on Piccadilly. Conviently close to the Green Park Tube Station, I never took a cab."
156,1258,"Jan 27 2008 	Perfectly fine enough	My husband and I stayed here over American Thanksgiving weekend using his Starwood points. I thought it was perfectly adequate. The bathroom was a little worn, but the bed was very comfortable. The size of the room was large and the heat worked very well (which was critical because it was extra cold for London that weekend). The lobby layout is a little strange - if you have a large suitcase, it makes more sense to enter through the back alley otherwise you schlep up and down some stairs and through a crowded bar area and tea room. The location is very, very convenient and in a nice neighborhood, so that can't be beat.My husband stayed there a few months before our visit for work and had a miserable experience. He could not get an internet connection in his room, which was a big problem given that he needed to get work done. We didn't try to use the internet in November, though, so I can't comment on that.Overall, I thought it was good enough for the money (in our case - free!), although not perfect."
157,1258,"Jan 20 2008 	Park Lane charm	I was worried about staying here after reading all the reviews on this site, however we found the Park Lane to be better than expected.Arrived mid day and they had both rooms ready for us to checkin. The rooms next to each other were nice sized rooms, both with nice bathrooms with tubs and separate rain style showers. Both had a wonderful view out over Green Park looking at Big Ben and the London Eye.This is an old style hotel, very British and with some need of renovations, however it still has lots of charm and beautiful public areas. I can see that the molding and doors were rather bashed in, and perhaps some adittional cleaning of windows and tile areas high above on the 10 foot ceilings in the bathroom.All in all it is still a pretty solid hotel. My take is that someone will step in and renovate this hotel and it will become a true gem ,like the Chancery Court hotel in London"
158,1258,"Jan 20 2008 	The Park Lane London - A Wonderful Hotel!	My wife and I stayed in the Shearton Park Lane Hotel in London last week for our honeymoon. We got it from Priceline, and as we wanted to check how good was our booked hotel, we went here and read the reviews.After reading the reviews we thought about trying to replace this hotel but I am SO glad that we didn't.The hotel has a GREAT location, just near the Green Park tube station, only one station from Oxford Circus so it is really in the center. The lobby is very nice, there is always something happening there (business meetings, etc.), and the room we have received was AMAZING - the kind of room you see in a 5 stars hotel. It was very big, clean, and had a huge bathroom. I think we got one of the renovated rooms, but I'm not sure.We also got some little surprises to our room for our honeymoon :)All in all, we had a great stay there and I highly recommened this hotel to anyone visiting London."
159,1258,"Jan 20 2008 	Just Plain BAD!	I stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane for 5 nights on business and I was so disapointed. The rooms are tiny, to get web access they make you call the reception desk and get a code. Everything about it is dated and old. The room is boiling in the evening and night and the AC - well it doesn't work. I've had to call down twice because there are children in the halls using it as a playground.Because I'm here on business I've had to eat at the restaurant downstairs (to save time). Service was horrible, took me over an hour to get my lunch and no one seems to care. The price at the restaurant is way over priced - 20 pounds/$40 for breakfast.The ONLY thing I've found positive about it is the location. Central and walking distance to many sites. It's also across the street from Hyde Park."
160,1258,"Jan 6 2008	I've stayed at 4 Points Sheraton that were better than this one!	Outdated, dilapidated, filthy, gross...I am shocked that they have not shut this place down to completely rennovate it - serious overhaul is required!"
161,1258,"Dec 31 2007 	Great place for central London	Myself, wife and daughter all stayed for 3 nights over the Christmas period and I can only say, what a great way to start the holiday.The room was larger than expected, the service was excellent and the hotel is in a great location that allows you to walk into the centre of London.we managed a run in St.James Park, which although cold, was very refreshing and an excellent way to get rid of any cobwebs caused by the festive excesses.Overall I would recommend the hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable stay in London."
162,1258,"Dec 29 2007 	Needs major work	This was our third stay, first two stays were very good, rooms were excellent, then our third stay:There were problems checking in. Clerks barely spoke English. The room was delayed by 2 hours. When we complained, I think we got the &quot;Complainers room&quot;. Every inch of the floor squeaked very loudly. Every time you used the plumbing it made loud noises. The room was barely big enough for one person never mind 2. In zero degree weather outside, it was warmer outside than in our room. It was sooo cold in the room. The Laundry shoot was right outside our door, and they would slam the door starting at 7am, it shook the whole room, probably the building too.For the price that we paid, it was not worth the stay. I don't think we will stay there again."
163,1258,"Dec 28 2007 	Excellent Hotel!	Our family of 5 just stayed at the Sheraton Park Lane with MUCH anxiety after reading all the negative reviews on this site. In fact I even tried to cancel our reservation and xfer to the Sheraton Belgravia which is significantly higher rated on tripadvisor. Thank God I didn't. This hotel is excellent. It's very convenient from 2 subway stops, we got upgraded to an executive room which was the most spacious room I've ever stayed in in London with the biggest bathroom I've ever seen in London. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was modern and clean, the room itself was luxurious and the service was impeccable. We ordered 2 rollaways for our 2 sons and before we got upstairs to our room, there was someone waiting to set up the beds. I've never seen such prompt service. The hallways of the hotel did have a faint smell and there's no free breakfast for Starwood platinum members. Other than those 2 faults, I can't think of anything I didn't absolutely love about this hotel and will definitely stay here again on my next visit. In fact I wish I'd stayed here rather than booking just 1 nite here and 3 nites at the Hyatt Churchill which is MUCH more expensive and made me upgrade for $$$ to a biggger suite because they refused to accommodate our kids. I've never written a review before but felt compelled to after seeingthe trashing this poor place got, it's totally undeserved and I'm perplexed why so many people had such a bad experience."
164,1258,"Dec 27 2007	Never again	Terrible experience! I appreciate it is England and living and hotel standards are of low quality, but rating this hotel as 5 far is a very big lie by the Sheraton group.Everything is old, obsolete, tired, rooms tiny, no air conditioning, no proper information in foreign languages about what needs to be done to have bedding changed, unpleasant staff, overpriced internet, very damp rooms."
165,1258,"Dec 20 2007 	Needs a serious overhaul	My husband and I stayed here for one night, last Friday. Upon arriving, we waited some time to be able to check in as there were many people checking in and only one desk clerk. We had to take our bags to our room ourselves (5 star hotel?!), and upon arriving at our 2nd floor room I was quite astonished as how small, grubby and tired our room was. The carpet was disgusting with dirt and stains, a television that looked out of the ark, and a bathroom that one would think twice about washing a dog in. I honestly have not seen a worst room since backpacking in my teens - and this was 150 and a 5 star! The room overlooked an internal void and so was very dingy, plus we could hear every word said by the people in the room next door.As we left that night to go out, we requested a room change and agreed to sort this out when we returned. The clerk promised faithfully to sort this out for us and said that we were not the only ones to complain about these rooms. When we returned at 1am, nothing had been done. We were eventually upgraded and moved ourselves and luggage to one of their executive rooms at 2am! This room was more spacious, but still nothing special. If you are thinking about staying here, the location is good, but there are definitely better hotels in this area."
166,1258,"Dec 14 2007	Give this one a pass	NOT RECOMMENDED: When visiting central London, you need to dial back your expectations in terms of room size and amenities.. This Mayfair property is central to everything. Check-in was slow. This old property is terribly over priced for what it delivers. My small room had a king size bed which occupied almost the entire room. The bath area, while clean, is terribly old. Avoid eating or drinking here, terribly over priced for what you get."
167,1258,"Dec 10 2007 	Better than last time but still very ""tired""	I stayed with my husband at the Park Lane hotel for the second time. The first time wasn't great - tiny room etc similar to other people who posted. This time I used some Starwood points to upgrade to a bigger room over looking the park.The bathroom was still in need of an overhaul and the corridors and reception are extremely tired looking. Our room was much better for the upgrade, although we did have to change rooms when we first arrived as the first clearly had a previous guest who smoked in it (we asked for non smoking).The room also had a seperate sitting room and a great view of the park - we had doors that opened onto a balcony. The bar area had a lovely christmas tree up and they do have a great drinks list (although its incredibly pricey even for London).There are nicer places to stay in London and I have stayed in some of them. This isn't the same standard as other Starwood properties."
168,1258,"Dec 1 2007 	Park Lane Sheraton-You can do better	I was generally disappointed. While the staff was good and the service above average, the hotel is not worthy of a 4 or 5 star rating. First, the charge was close to $500 US a night so you'd expect at least a quality room. The room was small by even European standards, the carpeting old and worn, no air conditioning (but they can provide a portable one which needs to vent through the open window) and a musty smell in the hallways and stairwells. There is no in room thermostat and when I entered the room it was like a sauna. The maintenance guy had to manually shut off the heat with a pair of pliers. They advertise that there is an in room safe but there was none in the room I had. Other than the closet shelf, there are no drawers to put your non-hanging clothes in. The plumbing for the shower/tub was rusting.....while the staff was very pleasant and helpful and the location was quite good, the hotel rooms need upgrading and attention and it does not present a reasonable value. I've stayed at 2 other places in London and found both to have higher room standards. I would not stay at this place again."
169,1258,"Nov 26 2007 	Dated and need major overhaul	If you are considering booking this hotel and have to pay for it yourself, I would suggest you look elsewhere. There must be better hotels or bed and breakfast at much cheapter rate. We stayed two nights at this hotel using our American Express points. This is an expensive hotel at over 200/night. The furniture are dated. Althoughthings are clean, everything just looks like it has seen better days.The bathroom is a strange shape -- long and narrow. There are no plugson the bathroom sink...not sure if it was stolen or the staff never bothered to replace it. The bedroom window looks out to the office tower across the narrow lane. The buildings are so close together you feel almost like you can reach out and touch them. What use to be the white sheer behind the curtain is now grey due to wear and lack of cleaning. The closet is fairly small. If you are staying for a longperiod it would probably not be enough space to store your luggage andyour clothes as there are no drawers anywhere in the room for clothes.Maybe due to the age of the building, one morning we got woken up by some noise in the pipes. It sounded like a far off car alarm but it was enough noise to completely wake us up. My partner suggested turning the bathroom taps on and off to loosen whatever is in the pipes. Thank goodness that worked. However, the next morning, it was our neighbours next door. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything that goes on.Checking in was a nightmare. For whatever reason, there was a long line up. The only good thing is that it is a short walk from Green Park staton."
170,1258,"Nov 18 2007 	Suffering from old age and neglect	This was a one night stop courtesy of my clients. I wish London hotels in this area stop using 'Park Lane' in their titles - it confused the hell out of me and out of a taxi driver!!The entrance in Piccadilly is impressive but back to front, for you have to walk through a very dated Palm Court to reach the Reception area which was reminiscent of a small modern bank! Check in was smooth and efficient.Lifts are few and far between for an hotel of this size and they are slow - really slow!!!Room 136 - A 6 feet wide bed dominated the room and my wife and I managed the art of sideways shuffling around it to reach the bathroom and the huge walk-in wardrobe, the cavernous ceiling made the room disproportionate as it appeared to be taller than longer or wider. It's not the dirtiest hotel room I've been in (that goes to an 'hotel from hell' in Derbyshire), but it was not the cleanest nor the driest for you didn't really want to walk barefoot in the carpet and there was evidence of dampness in the floor and on the walls.The bathroom was adequate despite the extremely dated fittings (and these were original, not repro!) the taps didn't close properly and tiling that had seen better days.View from the room was into a lightwell, but that is common in most capital city hotels.Breakfast in Bracewells Restaurant of the hotel was grossly overpriced for an English, and for 21.50, you would expect 2nd or even 3rd helpings at that price!Sadly, these observations are common with many older hotels in many major cities and these 'grand old ladies' are very maintenance intensive and their owners and management can't cope effectively."
171,1258,"Nov 18 2007 	Older London Hotel Excellent location Great Service	This is an older hotel, with classic touches. It could use some updates, but the older features add a quaintness that is unique to the other very modern Starwood properties I'm used to staying in. Thiswas a trip of pleasure and the location couldn't be better for one who wishes to see London for the first time. Prices are high for Americans (declining value of the USD), however that is the case with any hotel you would stay in. The concierge made two excellent dinner recommendations and room service was prompt. If you get a deal or are on vacation, I highly recommend the hotel."
172,1258,"Nov 13 2007 	Good but far from great	This hotel has great potential, but will need serious updates. Stayed here on a short business trip. The location is very good, right next to Green Park. First the bads. The reception area is in the back of the hotel through the restaurant/bar area. Not good. The elevators are loud and obnoxious. The wood floors under the old carpeting are the loudest, squeakest floors I have ever heard. The rooms are very small and quite dated. The fees for wireless Internet are out of this world. Internet fees should be a free-bee in any expensive hotel. There's no reason to be charging the fees they charge for Internet service. Each floor in this hotel should be completely gutted and redesigned/built from scratch. Yes, it is that old and dated. The reception area and elevators should also be moved to the front of the hotel. Millions should be spent updating this dinosaur and it could then easily be a world-class hotel (without raising the current charges). Now the goods. The beds and pillows are first-rate, very comfortable. The bath-tubs are deep and the water is powerful. The excercise room is nice, but no steam/sauna room, no hot-tub and no swimming pool. While I don't regret staying there, I will be looking else-where on my next visit. I think a much better room can be found for the same amount of money."
173,1258,"Nov 13 2007 	What a disappointment	My colleague and I booked in at the Sheraton as we were attending an awards dinner there the same evening. I don't get to stay in London very often, let alone in Park Lane so I was looking forward to a top class hotel and service. I was disappointed. My room was old, dark depressing and hot, even in November. It looked out on to the famous flat roof described in other reviews about this hotel. The bathroom was YMCA standard. The TV picture was awful. There wasn't even the facility to make yourself a coffee. Worst though was the reception. Allow time to check out as they don't have enough staff if someone ahead of you is disputing their bill you'll have a long wait and lots of people seem to dispute their bills here! Despite the fact that my company was picking up the tab including the cost of breakfast they tried to bill me for breakfast. I protested, they apologised for the mix up. Then 48 hours after my return home they put the cost on my credit card! My advice - If you can get away with it don't give them your credit card details. Not that I think they're dishonest I just feel they're too inefficient and disinterested."
174,1258,"Nov 5 2007 	Aging Inconsistent Facility	I had two separate stays during the end of October 2007 over the course of a week. As I was on business, the convenient location made it a worthwhile experiment. Unfortunately, the staff and aging facilities helped insure I will not return.The problems began at check-in, early on a Monday morning, when I was straight off a flight from Heathrow. The check-in attendant wore a badge identifying her as a trainee and insisted policy required a GBP 100 charge for an early check-in. There was no one else behind the desk at approximately 7:30am to provide any helpful overruling of this policy, despite ample vacancies. Thereafter, I got a room that featured worn carpet and aging furniture with a bath that looked like it was renovated recently on the cheap. Although the bath looked somewhat new, it had plenty of cracks that marked shoddy construction. Plus, my room featured a portable air conditioning (it was an incredibly 20 degrees Celsius during my stay). I have seen this before in older European hotels, but the exhaust was pointed right back in the room, rather than out a window. Adding insult to injury was a lack of in-room Internet other than a very slow (and still quite expensive) wifi that required calling down to the front desk, after which they returned my call with a pass code. And most surprising, my room lacked a safe, which I consider to be a basic amenity for any hotel that largely attracts foreigners with passports to store.My second stay later in the week offered a room with internal air conditioning/heating and a safe (after a specific request). However, the hotel is clearly old and run down. The staff was polite on my second check-in, but slow and quite inefficient. Despite hundreds of rooms, the hotel seems to staff its front desk with only one person, who is also responsible for answering calls for any requests from people in the rooms. This overloading makes accomplishing basic tasks quite difficult (and was a reason I did not request a new room the first time around -- the line was too long to even make the request).In total, at a reasonable price, this hotel would suffice. However, it was charging rates consistent with other business hotels that I know to have a higher quality offering."
175,1258,"Nov 4 2007 	Good With the Right Room	This hotel is in a good location and, with the right room, is good. With the wrong room it is terrible.I stayed at this hotel through booking via priceline.com. You never know which hotel you'll end up with via priceline, but I got this hotel by bidding $180 US for a 4 star hotel which is about half of the regular room rate. After I learned I was assigned this hotel, I was not too pleased after reading the reviews here. When I checked in, the bad reviews were confirmed.I was given an &quot;old&quot; room with shabby carpets, stuffy with a portable air conditioner, and a window that opened to a large roof-top A/C vent that was terribly noisy. The room was dark and was indeed old. I realized that I had been given one of the &quot;bad&quot; rooms described elsewhere here.I went to the desk to complain and request a new room. They were nearly sold out and was told that they had two available &quot;executive&quot; rooms but at a cost of an additional 40 ($80 US). This was still a better deal than if I had booked directly with the hotel. The &quot;new&quot; room was great. It was large, had a separate bath and shower, a great bed, central air and heat, and everything was clean and new. A two-night stay here was very relaxing and well worth the money.From what I can gather, this hotel has two types of rooms: old/terrible and new/nice. I'm not sure if all of the new/nice rooms are called &quot;executive,&quot; but they probably are. Be sure that if you reserve directly with the hotel that you clarify that you are getting one of the newer rooms. If you use Priceline, I am quite sure you will be given an old room, so be prepared to pay extra to upgrade as the old rooms are definitely not 4-star quality.The hotel's dining options are very expensive. The bar serves a decent menu and mixes excellent drinks. But, a martini is 11 ($22 US). I don't care how good the drinks are, they aren't worth that.This is certainly a 4 star hotel if you get a new room; a 2 star (if that) if you get an old room. I would stay here again, but if all they had was an old room, I'd look elsewhere."
176,1258,Nov 3 2007 	Love the Sheraton Park Lane	I just don't get all the bad reviews on this site for the Park Lane. We were there in 2001 and had such a wonderful experience we knew we would stay there again on our return. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we were afraid we would be disappointed. We weren't. The hotel was just as great the second time around. The room was huge and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is exceptional. I've posted pictures of our room. It was amazing. Another great trip and we will absolutely stay there again whenever we return to London.
177,1258,Nov 3 2007	Urgently needs a refit	I booked the hotel on a last minute web site at a discount rate. I knew it from the outside and it looked good with a great location.Strange entrance off Piccadilly. You had to travel through the bar to get to the reception desk with very poor signs.I had booked and paid for a double room but was given a single. It was the end of a long day and I could not be bothered arguing.The room was an OK size for a single but in very poor condition except for a good bed. The bathroom was very tired and grubby.Nor reccomended - I would not stay there again.
178,1258,"Oct 23 2007 	Great Location Tired decor Indifferent staff	Location: wonderful. You can walk to just about any kind of attraction or shopping. But as others have mentioned the Picadilly Decor: Omigosh! Everything is worn and sagging - except the bed, which was great. My room was spacious, but dark. The carpets are worn and spotty. The single, small, old school TV was a top the minibar with an attempt to locate it centrally in the room to serve the sitting and sleeping areas. Too bad they didn't put it on a swiveling base so I had to scuff the wooden cabinet when I wanted to move the TV. I had booked an in-room massage. They didn't show up and no-one ever called to let me know what happened. I had to call the concierge and after explaining I had no other time on my visit to re-book, he continually asked me when did I want to reschedule. I don't think I would stay here again unless they 1) remodel or 2) were running a great special as there are so many hotels in London that you can nearly always find a decent deal."
179,1258,"Oct 19 2007 	Disgusting.	One of the worst rooms I've had in all of London. Disgusting dirty carpets and walls (!), primitive bathroom with barely functioning toilet, unsecured window directly adjoining a flat roof with no other means of ventilation all for 180/night breakfast not included. When I asked for directions, the concierge and 2 of his cronies scratched their heads and sucked their teeth &quot;Oh, don't really know where that is, mate.&quot; Also, no offer of a map as I set out in search of the address on my own. All this for a Starwood preferred guest? Way way way below par for Starwood."
180,1258,"Oct 11 2007 	Poor property poor service	We all know London is expensive, so the 250 pound rate for a central location in London is fine. But they're only getting this amount due to their name, nothing else. Even people in London know how shabby the Park Lane Sheraton is.We asked for a crib, not only when reserving, but then in a follow-up e-mail with the manager a couple days in advance (response confirmed a crib would be in the room). We arrived at 11pm after a transatlantic journey and there was no crib. We waited 45 mins for it to be sent up, before I went to the front desk to be told they were all out and were searching other hotels for one. I was told they had found one and it would be 10mins. Long story short, 2 hours after arrival a crib showed up (1am). We did get a free breakfast out of it (thank goodness, at 40 pounds a couple).What else:- Room was never cleaned well at all (no dusting, etc). Used glasses were rarely replaced.- Heating system wasn't working in rooms, so needed to request portable heaters- Internet access was not available for first two days- Overall, property is okay on lobby level, but a bit tired everywhere elseOn the other hand, staff was pleasant/courteous. Bed was comfortable.Lots of other places in London that are much better value."
181,1258,"Sep 24 2007 	Average Hotel - not great not bad	Stayed here on the first two nights of my two week european trip. We got there early and were not able to get our room right away so walked to the Hard Rock Cafe just around the corner and got a beer for an hour to wait - no big deal.The reception people are fine - and the concierge was helpful. Overall I give the staff positive points. The hotel itself is pretty nice on the inside - has a cool lounge area for all to sit in and drink tea, or just hang out. The locations is really more on picadilly than park lane which is nice. You have a short 5-10 minute walk up to picadilly circus and the information center, and a 2 min walk to the park lane tube station. I didn't buy the breakfast though as your choices are american or full english breakfast ranging from 18-25pounds per person which is roughly 40-50 dollars - way more than I was hoping to spend. Instead we walked up the street to a Pret Manger which is next to the starbucks and got a few sandwhiches and drinks all for 8 pounds - far better for the wallet.The room itself was where they lost a little bit. The room we got was somewhat roomy but it was old looking. If you want a clean looking room that doesn't show any wear - this is not for you. Basically the room just looked old which I don't really like. The pro's is that their cable gives you a lot of channels to view - whereas most only give you about 10. So to recap- pro's are location, staff, lounge/bar area. Con's are the overall condition of the rooms, food prices."
182,1258,"Sep 22 2007	God Save....the Park Lane	Wonderful location across from Green park, thus the name. Bizarre entrance, if you will. You go through a revolving door and an employee asked me if I needed help.Men weren't asked if they needed help. Perhaps they are trying to weed out &quot;working women&quot;. I do not look the part. No make up, reasonable shoes. They do seem to have Russian women who &quot;work&quot; in London . One has to traverse the dark Palm Court to get to reception which is tucked off to the side rather unceremoniously . Near it is a small back entrance that leads to an alley. Things are located at weird angles. The decor is ugly as all get out except for the dark Palm court. So dark, no make up needed ladies.  We walked down a drab hall to our room. The teal blue carpet with hideous floral? design failed to tempt us. The room had ikea cheap furniture....e bay &quot; buy it now&quot; quality. We traveled across the pond an expected some semblance of charm, which eluded us at the Park lane. The shower is an absolute joke. The tub is extremely narrow with a shower curtain and impossible to navigate. There are no plugs to use in the bathroom to use an adapter so I was stuck trying to dry very long hair with a pathetic weak wall unit. They did make up the room each day in record time and did a nice job of cleaning it.  The concierge all but tolerated us Yanks. If I may say so, we are quiet and polite and NOT demanding. They were underwhelming in their efforts and did not offer to make a reservation when asked for recommendations on dining. I liked the location very much but the hotel is not one I would recommend. It rather stinks in its lack of effort to be accommodating, attractive and appealing. I would give it a 1 star rating and suggest they try a little harder."
183,1258,"Sep 20 2007 	Okay if you get the right room	This was the third time I have stayed at the Park Lane in the past year. I generally agree with some of the negative comments regarding decor (outdated/boring) and the time since the last rehab (easily 20 years - although all the beds are new). However, if you get the right room it is a great experience. Checked in late on Saturday night and was told I was being upgraded to a suite overlooking the park (#192). That sounded great until I got in the room and realized that meant heavy street traffic just outside my window and that the room didn't have air conditioning. The next morning they were very nice in offering to change our room - even going so far as to give us keys to four or five rooms and letting us pick. Our new room (#322) was big, air conditioned, and quiet. The staff are very nice, the location is convenient to Mayfair, the Green Park tube station, Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, and with a bit of a walk, Soho. Haven't taken advantage of hotel dining opportunities but the afternoon tea seems to be very popular."
184,1258,"Sep 19 2007 	Great location	After reading the most upto date reviews on this hotel I was slightly nervous about visiting this hotel as we were going to this hotel for my mothers 60th birthday.However I was extremely surprised!!!!!!The room we were allocated was a good size as there were 3 of us staying in the room (this was also a standard room).The decor and condition of the room were of a good standard.When we checked into the room no 3rd bed was made up but after speaking to reception this was done immediately and we given a free bottle of wine for our trouble. The hotel is in a fantastic location could not have asked for a better location to see all the sights of London.All the staff we encountered were very pleasant, courteous and happy to help.In summary if you want to stay in a nice unique hotel in one of the best location in London then this hotel is perfect for you. However this hotel is probably not your typical Sheraton hotel but after all it is in London and I would much prefer to stay in a hotel where you are aware of the country you are staying in rather than a hotel that could be the same as any other hotel in the world"
185,1258,"Sep 11 2007 	If only the rooms lived up to the public areas	We had only one night in London and stayed at the Shertaon Park Lane on StarPOints--in a Studio Suite. It was our wedding anniversary and the hotel sent aus chilled wine as a welcome gift--nice touch.The public areas of the hotel are stunning--especially the Palm Court. But our suite--at the end of a service hallway, was underwhelming. The room may have been bnewly-decorated but it was dull, dull, dull, The view of the alley and backs of buildings did not help. There are small issues that detract as well--beautiful marble bathroom that is very well laid out--but there is a heated towel rod that has been turned off and a phone jack with no phone. It is like the hotel is stepping backwards in terms of luxury. Absolutely huge walk in closets were a great surprise, and the King Bed was highly comfortable--good job. The air conditioning was central air and worked perfectly--but it was a suite. I cannot imagine what a standard room would look like.The morning breakfast was in Bracewells--a beautiful old room tha tlooks like lit was once a very elegant restaurant for formal meals. Anyhow--excellent breakfast, beautiful china and warm service. The Palm Court was a lovely place for tea with live harpist and good service.Watch the additional phone charges--a call through Canada Direct-- a free 1-800 service--resulted in a an over 9 pound charge to the room--and there was no willingness to remove the cost. Overall, the hotel was mediocre but could be so much more with a little loving care."
186,1258,"Sep 6 2007 	Pathetic	How can this be a Sheraton?Park Lane conjures images of grandeur and excellence. This hotel falls far short. The rooms must have last been refurbished 30 years ago. The bathroom locks have 'vacant' and 'occupied' signs from the 50's. Cannot believe this is a SheratonThe room is pathetically small. The decor is outdated. The airconditioning unit is a portable unit ducted through the window. There is no safe in the room. The general decor was beyond my worst nightmares ...there is NO WAY I will stay here again, even if they paid me"
187,1258,"Sep 5 2007 	We very much enjoyed the Park Lane hotel.	My wife, daughter, and I stayed at the Park Lane Sheraton in London for 5 days in July. Having read some negative reviews at TripAdvisor, I was concerned that the hotel might be disappointing. In fact, The Park Lane Sheraton was delightful. Our room was very large, clean, quiet, and comfortable. Hotel staff were superb, attentive, and helpful. Room service was very good, as were the restaurants, and the tea service in the lobby. As others have noted, the location is perfect; easy walking distance to both Picadilly and Herrods. The neighborhood behind the hotel, Mayfair, has wonderful restaurants and shops as well. Though the dollar is historically weak, the Park Lane is a good value at a fabulous address.We will definitely revisit."
188,1258,"Aug 31 2007 	5 Pounds for 15 minutes to compose a Word document?	The rooms could use a little updating, though were quite comfortable.The staff was pleasant, and the breakfasts were nice.While planning the trip their web site mentioned a business center, so I decided not to travel to the UK with my laptop. I was surprised to see they charge 5 pounds ($10.00) per 15-minute use of the business center computers - even if you wish to simply upload photos or draft a word document. The tube had many ads for Virgin High Speed at around 20 pounds or so per month, so they may have a good margin on this service.I do not begrudge them for turning a profit...just would suggest an indication of the cost of services on their web site. I did use the service enough they could possible repair the leaky faucits in my guest room. Overall, we did love the location and it was a great visit."
189,1258,Aug 14 2007 	I liked the Sheraton Park Lane	I spent a total of 5 nights (four nights on the first stay and then one night a week later) at the hotel and really enjoyed the experience. The rooms werre very nice and comfortable. They both had large bathrooms with a separate showers. We had a very enjoyable and tasty lunch at the Citrus located in the hotel's lobby. The hotel's location was great and I thought the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay at this hotel again without hesitation.
190,1258,"Aug 7 2007 	Shabby 3 star that needs work	I just came back from staying at the Park Lane August 3-5, 2007. I have to agree with many of the other reviews that this hoel has great public spaces but the shabby bedooms need work. However, the hotel is convenient to tube and has 24 service which is great for business travellers.The front of the hotel faces Green Park but the proper hotel entrance is on the back . It is fine if you are coming by taxi as the drivers all know this, but if you are coming by Tube, you will end up carrying your luggage across a hall and through the tea room/restaurant and bar. And there are no porters to help until you get through the back of the hotel where the official entrance is located. I saw many tourists obviously stumbling off of overseas flights trying to figure out where to go!The desk staff have the typical bored nature of most hotel staff but the porters and concierge are helpful and pleasant. I was first given a room on the first floor but when I asked to change to a higher floor, they changed it to the third floor easily enough. I booked through Priceline so I wasn't given a preferred room on the Starwood floor that other reviewers have mentioned. The room was pretty shabby but clean except for the carpet. The paint was peeling and there were marks on the wall and the carpet was filthy contrasting with the hall carpet which was new and clean. The bathroom was shabby with cracked tiles, paint peeling, and just old. But it was clean and big enough and a huge tub. The saving grace was the bed was brand new, clean, and very comfortable. The bed was great.Obviously my room was once a large room that had been divided into two tiny ones. European hotel rooms are always small so it didn't really bother me but there was too much furniture in the room for that size. The desk table was pushed perpendicular against another console so it couldn't be used--and the computer plug and light didn't work--and the desk chair rubbed shoulders with the room's easychair that was right next to a wall. Consequently, I couldn't get to or use the room's mirror over the console table to use the hairdryer. And like most English hotels, there wasn't a bathroom outlet. The closet was huge and I think they should have placed the dresser --a tiny Ikea cheap thing--inside for more room. The tv was tiny with poor reception but I wasn't in the room enough to watch.I was fortunate to not have one of the portable airconditioners that were evident in other rooms--I could see the tubes snaking out the windows, and since it was cool, I didn't need to run it which is fortunate since it seems very noisy and old. If it was hot outside, I could see how this would be a problem.The location was good. The hotel just down the street from the Green Park stop which is convenient to two lines and also near an M&amp;S Simpley Food (which remarkably was open late for London--until at least 8:30 pm), a Boots chemist, and Starbucks which was convenient for quick food and necessities. The hotel was located down from Picadilly--a bit of a walk but certainly easy. As a female travelling alone, I found the street a bit too quiet for my taste while walking back alone after 9 pm (Park on one side and empty offices surrounding the hotel) and it felt a little sketchy. Would I stay here again? If I had to I would be fine--it is easy, but the shabby rooms seem to outnumber the ones that are for Starwood preferred guests with lots of points so it seems to be a matter of luck if you get a refurbished room."
191,1258,"Aug 5 2007 	Great location but really needs refurbishing	I have stayed twice here over the last 15 months, for a combined 10 days. My experiences have been mixedFirst the good things. Its in a great location - walking distance or a short train ride to Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly, Trafalgar Square and most other touristy places. And if the primary purpose of the trip is business, the nearby Green Park Underground station puts you at the City establishments in 20 minutes and the Canary Wharf area in 30 minutes. Heathrow is abou 30 minutes by taxi. The staff is quite helpful, and you get the feel of a small, boutique hotel. The breakfast is great, and so is the WiFi in the rooms. Now the bad part. The property is really old. Though the lobby and check in areas are great, the rooms need serious work. They are pretty much like what you see in a 2 star establishment. Small, cramped bathrooms with the tiles and fixtures showing signs of age. Old carpets. Small 22&quot; TVs. Lighting from the 80's.After my first trip, I promised that I would not come back here, but had to come back because all other Starwood properties in London were booked. But if they refurbish the place, it would be a great place to return to."
192,1258,"Aug 1 2007 	Good experience at the Park Lane	My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Park Lane. We originally stayed at another hotel outside the city, but decided we wanted to be closer to the sights, etc. We picked the Park Lane for the location and because it is a Starwood property. We booked a standard room for 219 GBP. The room was fine--nice king bed, good size bath and closet, was clean and well attended,. We did not have the portable air conditioner that I saw in some of the other reviews. I am really suprised by some of the pictures and other reviews--I am not sure I would have chosen the hotel had I seen that before we booked. All in all, I thought the hotel was great for the price and the location (which was fantastic!)"
193,1258,"Jul 9 2007 	Worst 5 star ever	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, a last minute decision. Since all hotel rooms were quite expensive (Wimbledon+Tour de France in town) decided to stay in a &quot;nice hotel&quot; just like I happen to do ~150 nights a year for work purpose and booked a five star one. Man, what a disappointment.Reception is in the back of the hotel so you basically have to go through the tea area with all your luggage (feels great!) and of course you have to do everything yourself cause no staff is to be seen. We stayed on the Starwoord Preferred Guests floor (woohoo what a joy): the bed was as small as could be and indeed there was a huge air conditioning in the room making a terrible noise (so what do you do: you shut it off well... don't bother cause outside there is a huge airco system making even more noise). Bathroom is old and ugly and the morning after when I wanted to adjust the shower head the whole bar and stuff came off the wall). Never experienced such a bad 5 star hotel and I do not wonder any longer why nowhere around the hotel you see an official accreditation. A letter of complaint is on its way to Sheraton.My advice: if you want to stay in luxury BOOK ANOTHER HOTEL, really (even if it costs a bit more) or else just SAVE on your money and go to a hostel, the Park Lane only offers you hostel service anyway"
