55,800,"Dec 12 2007 	Quality and Comfort dont live up to expectations of a pricey kensington	The hotel is in a fine part of London over looking Hyde Park, and is a hotel which pronounces charm, sophistication and prominence over other hotels located in the same road. On entering there are two welcoming reception desks, not counters, offering a chance to check in as a person not as a number? Beyond reception is a small bar and small restaurant, so on initial views this is a hotel to stay over night, but not to spend a day relaxing as there are very few public spaces in which to enjoy the limited amenities.The room is typical of many Hiltons with the standard smart decor, and the beds extremely comfortable. The room was spacious and had all the amenities you would require, including large TV, coffee, hair dryers, complimentary water, etc. Again the bathroom was spacious, well presented, although extremely disappointing was the paint failing off the ceiling which looked terrible. The bar area is small but with a range of comfortable sofas and chairs. The bar staff however where less than polite, rushing us in our selection of drinks as if it was some take away food outlet. I felt perhaps he felt we where not of a high enough society level to be in his bar almost implying that we had walked off the streets, despite spending over five hundred pounds for a two night stay. The restaurant is again small, however the quality of staff was exceptional, and achieved the highest standards of service I have yet encountered in any Hilton hotel. The food was average, with the ceaser salad being basic with a dressing akin of a cheap supermarket brand and the majority of the cheese board made up of those packaged cheeses such as babybel. Breakfast was superb, with a good choice of food. However unlike other Hilton hotels, no food was freshly cooked, and on asking for fresh fried eggs, the waitress emerged ten seconds later with a plate of 15 fried eggs prepared some time earlier and equally dried up. That said, it was a good choice on the buffer selection and no real complaints.Overall this is an ok hotel hence my mark, but only as a hotel to stay in overnight. I will end with my main complaint, although this was probably a one off, and is down to room availability only. I had specifically paid full rate for a deluxe room on the premise that **Most rooms have a view over Kensington Gardens**. On top of this being a valued Hilton honors member, I expected a room with views, where as instead I had a room out the back. One window over looked the fire escape and another window directly overlooking other peoples hotel bedroom windows. As I was attending a mind challenging course, the choice of hotel was extremely important to me, and therefore the prospect of views over Kensington gardens was for me the balance of a city hotel with country views. I was therefore extremely disappointed."
56,800,"Nov 26 2007 	Dissapointing	My Wife and I booked this stay over 3 months ago and were looking forward to this trip as it was also our honeymoon. On arrival at 215pm, we were informed that our room wasn`t ready and to come back at 3pm. The room was clean if a little compact, a nice LCD TV was in the room however the picture it recieved was pretty poor. There was the usual tea, coffee, water etc but no mini bar. There was a free safe though which was handy. The staff were helpfull enough, up untill the point I asked why the room was so hot and asked how the AC worked only to be told &quot;its winter sir and isntt turned on&quot;!! I ordered 2 papers which took 10mins todo at reception and in the morning they had not arrived, when asked where they were I was told the Hotel didnot get the ones I asked for!!!! Another 10mins taking off the non arrived papers from our bill. The staff were helpfull with travel advice, ie directions for Harrods to walk rather than 3 changes on the tube. Breakfast on the 1st morning was very busy and not up to much, the toast machine was very slow to say the least. 2nd Morning- We were awoke by knocking on the door by a maid asking if she could clean the room......910am!!!! NOT HAPPY. Breakfast again ruined by faulty toast machine also both the tea and coffee was vile everyday. The 2nd morning we were unable to have either a bath or a shower as there was NO hot water!!!On the last night we had dinner as part of the booking package and in all honesty it wasn`t of the standard I could eat. we both ordered steaks and both were greasy and inedible, we sent both back and told the hotel we didnt want anymore food. To their credit the hotel took off money off our bill for this non-meal.On the whole I found this hotel to charge top dollar for a 2nd rate service, the staff were ok and the hotel clean. Location was great...would I return? probably not..........."
57,800,"Nov 21 2007	I would go Back	Really enjoyed my stay at the Hyde Park Hilton in London. Booked using londontown.com and received a free dinner with booking, both the food and the service were very good. Free english breakfast is included (bacon, eggs, pancakes etc.). Our room was nice and clean, and had a big bathroom with a bath tub, which my wife was happy about. A lot of the other hotels we have stayed at in Europe only had stand up showers."
58,800,"Nov 6 2007 	Will stay again....	We stayed at the Hilton London Hyde Park Hotel for two nights whislt we visited Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at Claridges. The hotel is next door to Queensway tube, but you wouldn't have known. As part of our package we were entitled to a free meal on the first night of our stay plus breakfast each morning. On arrival, check in was a little slow due to a queue of arrivals but the reception staff were very apologetic and checked us in quickly when it was our turn. They immediately booked us into the restaurant at the time we requested. On arrival into the room, it was small and faced the rear of the property, which faced another building, not the greatest of views! However, the room was clean and superbly kitted out with an iron, ironing board, hairdrier, modem connetion. The bathroom had bathrobes and all the normal free shampoo's etc.On arrival in the restaurant, we were greeted immediately, seated and advised of the menu available. The food was great, including the vegetarian option for my wife.The following morning, we went down for breakfast and had to wait for a table. The restaurant was very business as you would expect at breakfast time. The breakfast selection was superb from full english to continental and more.The only downside to our whole stay was the room was a little warm and no matter how we adjusted the air con, it never got cooler. We didn't complain as it was unbearable."
59,800,"Nov 3 2007	central and quiet	Hilton Hyde Parks staff are not as attentative i thought on the other reviews. I had a meeting in london invited my wife with me for the weekend and requested an early check in, the reception staff let my wife sit in the reception and ask her to wait for the room for almost 3 hours. this is bad service and then in the end gave us a less good room than expected! Apart from the bad start, the breakfast buffet was nice and the approxmity to everything was good!"
60,800,"Nov 2 2007 	Not quite 4 star	I was so excited to be staying in the hilton hyde park, but my excitement didnt last long, there is no parking available so we were advised by the reception to park nearby in a car park costing 22 FOR THE NIGHT. The paintwork along the skirting boards could do with a coat of paint, and the room was very cold when we arrived we put the heating on full. I was looking forward to a lie in as it was my birthday but we had a cleaner knock then enter our room at 7.30am!!! which woke us up, then as we were just getting to sleep another cleaner came an hour later so this was very irritating. Overall, it was okay we got a last minute sort of deal but i wouldn't hurry back."
61,800,"Oct 8 2007 	Great location and lovely staff!	Hi stayed at the Hilton Hyde park for 1 night last weekend as we were in London to see Grease as a treat for my daughters 18th. We booked 2 double rooms on a good deal. One overlooked the park and the other overlooked the street at Queensway. Both rooms were equally clean and comfortable. They were not enormous but all you would expect from a london hotel. You could not beat the location right next door to Queensway tube you literally turned the corner and you were there. Also a couple of mins walk from Baywater tube making it easy to visit various locations in the city. The shops, bars and restaurants in Queensway were wonderful. There was such a varied selection of restaurants it was hard to choose which one we wanted to visit! The best thing about the Hilton was the staff. They were so friendly. When Rukhsana on reception found out it was my daughters 18th she went out of her way to wish her happy birthday and later when we were sat in the bar she and some of her staff crept up on us with delicious chocolate cake and free champagne to celebrate! What a lovely touch. I would certainly recommend the Hilton Hyde Park to others, it may not have been all marble and luxury but it was warm and welcoming and thats worth a whole lot more in my book."
62,800,"Aug 22 2007 	Friendly Staff but somewhat clueless Clean Quiet Hotel Great Location	This was my second stay at the Hilton Hyde Park. Although I'm going back for another stay there were some issues. When I arrived at 11PM on a Saturday night desperately needing some antihistamines the consierge told me I'd have to wait until Monday as nothing was open. As I wandered down Queensway I found 4 places that sell meds still open and a Boots open until midnight every day but Sunday. Obviously he hadn't done his homework.Room service was slow, and when I needed ice for a black eye (don't ask, wasn't a pub fight!) they were a bit confused by the request. I needed to extend my stay a week and called the hotel directly and spoke to Emma. After much humming and haaing and asking my name 5 times (no joke) she finally said I was confirmed for an extra week. When I arrive at the hotel that evening my extension was NOT in the system and Emma had gone home. The desk staff helped me get my stay extended.The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable but get a double since the singles are tiny. Bathrooms are small and if you get a room with just a shower expect to hit your elbows to the walls. I'm not a big woman and it was tight for me. It's a great location, tons of restaurants and pubs on Queensway right around the corner from the hotel: Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese, Indian, Greek and Italian. Portabello Market is 4 blocks away and the view of Kennsington Gardens and Hyde Park can't be beat.When booking be careful because they quote some prices with VAT and others without on the Hilton web site. Makes comparisons difficult."
63,800,"Jun 28 2007 	Fantastic Location!	Very convenient for any traveler wanting to get around via the tube (instead of taxis)! Close to Paddington (1-2 tube stops), and across from one of Hyde Park's gates.Right around the corner from Queensway (on the Central Line) - literally about 30 steps from the exit! Bayswater is only about 1.2 blocks away - not too far, but might be tough with luggage. If going into LHR, take the Heathrow Express to Paddington station (if you are leaving out of LHR, buy a return ticket to save you time on your return to the station at the end of your trip), then follow the signs to the Underground. If you are going to use the tube for more than one journey in downtown London, buy a day pass for zones 1-2 (it is 5.2 as opposed ot paying 4 pounds for only one segment of the journey).Rooms were clean, beautiful and spacious (compared to many other London rooms at comparable prices I've stayed over the past 6+ trips there) and the beds were firm with wonderful comforters, pillows, tea/coffee in room, complimentary bottled water, Locking safe in closet, etc. Lovely.If you are bringing a wireless laptop, the Ground floor gets very busy, but the 1st floor has seats, desks, and wireless access easy (and free). I would advise taking the stairs or elevator to the first floor (it was impossible to access wireless from my 3rd &amp; 4th floor rooms during my 2 stays there during this trip).A little way past the Bayswater Underground station is a wonderful Italian restaraunt (Ristorante Italiano). Both pasta dishes and the appetiser we had were amazing (and the garlic bread was delightful). Don't bother with one of the Bella's! We tried this as well (it was the only thing open after the theatre at 11pm, and it wasn't worth it). There are many other eateries in that same area (very local area), including an Indian restaraunt, Moroccan, Greek, Pizza Hut, Deli, and more (including a local grocery store).We walked Hyde park at different times of the day (6am one morning, 9pm one night, etc.) for about 3-4 miles (all on different paths), and it is amazing. Worth it to see all the locals picnicing, walking dogs, exercising, lush gardens, horseback riders, feeding swans/geese/ducks, going to work, etc. I highly advise crossing the street from the hotel, and exploring the park (which is very friendly and seemingly clean).Enjoy your stay. I was there for business, and still enjoyed my visit much more due to the hotel's location and atmosphere."
64,800,"Jun 28 2007 	A fantastic hotel in a great location!	We stayed at this hotel during the fall of 2006. The location was fabulous! I was able to walk to many places, took a taxi easily to shopping locations, and there was a double-decker tour bus stop just across at Hyde Park. The hotel staff and concierge were so helpful and friendly. The room was a bit on the small side; there were only 2 of us and it did feel tight. However, I went to London to see London and not stay in my hotel room, so it wasn't that big of a problem. I would absolutely stay here again! Great for couples and families with teenagers. I don't know if I would bring my 4 boys to stay here - it was definitely an upscale business crowd!"
65,800,"Jun 23 2007 	Friendly and Incompetent	Having stayed at a number of Hilton hotels in London, I tried the Hyde Park location. The area is ok - but restaurants and bars are a bit lacking - jump down to kensington instead. Tube is right near by - which is good. Rooms are fairly standard - but the Hilton Trafalgar, Paddington, and Heathrow are all a step above Hyde Park. The service is very friendly, but basically incompetent. Concierge appears to be useless - and almost asks for tips at every point. Room service was a joke - 20 minute service turned into est. 1 hr, then never showed and I ended up cancelling.Likely won't stay here again!"
66,800,"Jun 23 2007	Had a great 3 generation stay	My husband and I (mid60s/70), daughter and niece (mid20's) and grandaughter (4) stayed for 4 nights in August 2006. We had a double room opposite the park, and the girls had a double + bedsettee on the corner of the building. We were very pleased with our stay despite doing lots of research on alternatives (the girls have tight budgets) we are about to book again for this year. It was excellent. The staff were very obliging. The location was great - tubes and buses (got Oyster opasses each) took us everywhere easily, and the park was great for Diana playground etc., and the girls went running and swimming in the park before breakfast. More than happy to go back again. I don't think 25 is a lot for a dinner - its the usual hotel rate, and we would spend that if we went to our local pub and had 3 courses. There are loads of eating places in Queensway if you want to eat elsewhere."
67,800,"May 11 2007 	Hotel is great for Tube Location	This Hotel, while certainly not a luxury hotel, is clean, efficient and the staff is courteous. My mother (age 75) and I (33) stayed for 6 days. Breakfast Buffet: We are diamond members, so as many other trip advisor members have noted, the breakfast was free. The selection of items on the buffet was impressive. I particularly recommend fresh French bread with Black Currant Jam (found on your table). It isn't something we find here in the states often. Also included, Fried Eggs, Scrambled Eggs, Mushrooms, Sausage with Leeks, Bacon, a selection of canned fruits in bowls, Cheese slices, Cold Deli Meats, Assortment of Breads you can slice off yourself and white bread for toast, Waffles (I don't recommend...they are crunchy), Cereals, Pastries and of course Tea, Coffee, and Orange Juice (Plus other juices located at the bar. We had tea, and can recommend it. They give you a little pot at your table so you can refill it yourself (a nice touch on a busy morning).Check-in: Flawless experience. Upgraded to a deluxe room. They were fine with redeeming reward points and we didn't have to pay any taxes on the room or anything. Entire stay was indeed Free.Room: Deluxe room on 4th floor away from Elevator. We had 2 twin beds that were really comfey and a desk, chair, TV on a stand (under which was the tea service) and a nice size bathroom for English standards. We were very satisfied with the room. It was quiet, as it was tucked away from the street and we did not hear any other guests, even though the hotel was booked.Local Area: Hotel is located next to Tube Stop &quot;Queensway&quot; on the central line. It is a short walk down the street to the &quot;Bayswater&quot; stop on the circle line (which gets you to Every main attraction). It was easy to use the tube and the doormen always give lovely directions. Directly across from the Hotel is Hyde Park. I found it safe all times of the day and night (up to 9 PM). It is an easy walk to Kensington Palace and the round lake. Also, it was a 10 min walk to Portabello Road. Local Restaurants: Try the Waffles along the street adjoining the hotel. I particularly liked the Toffee Waffle...so delicious. Also, the Fish &amp; Chips at the Queens Arms pub was quite good. And, there is a little italian restaurant close to the Bayswater tube stop (NOT Bella) that is to die for...the lasagna was amazing.Taxi's: A trip to/from Heathrow should cost no more that 40 pounds. Always ask the price to the taxi Every time a driver picks you up...even if the hotel tells you the price, ask the driver. We found the hotel gave us lower numbers that the drives and we could negotiate the hotel rates...so ASK. And Never get in a Mercedes cab...they are considered luxury vehicles and they charge way to much. ATM: There is an ATM on the side street adjoining the hotel approx 1 block away. Never had any difficulty getting monies and always felt safe. Enjoy your stay if you decide to go with this hotel. It isn't fancy, but it is comfortable and located well for using the Tube."
68,800,"May 2 2007 	One night in London	Recently stayed at the Hyde Park Hilton for the first time in 2 years. The check in was very efficient and as a HHonors member I was upgraded to a Deluxe Room and offered complimentary full English breakfast.The rooms were smaller than I remembered but OK for an overnight stay. The bathroom was of a reasonable size but overall the room would benefit from being redecorated.Had a nightcap at the bar downstairs  surprisingly cheap for a central London hotel. However, Ill be glad when such areas are smoke free.Breakfast is served either in the restaurant or in the area near the bar and is very good  the selection is great and apart from a problem with the non-appearance of our coffee the service was fantastic.Overall this is a very good property but it is a 10-15 cab ride from the West End  Id use the tube if you want to get around from Hyde Park."
69,800,"Apr 28 2007 	Hated it	This is not a 4/5 star Hilton property, although it is advertised as such. More than a few problems during my stay - Internet did not work in the first 2 rooms I was put in (death to the business traveller), no water pressure, paper-thin walls, and constant construction. The staff was very nice, and pretty much said that their hands were tied - I get the feeling that Hilton corporate is not putting any money into this hotel. Ideally, it should be refurbished and revamped to justify it's price point. In fact, I wouldn't have had a problem if they branded this hotel as a Hilton Garden Inn - that's what it's equivalent to."
70,800,"Apr 24 2007 	I liked it	It is no news how hard it is to find a decent hotel in London without paying a small fortune. When I got a good deal for this hotel I booked it straight away. After booking I checked at tripadvisor and got a bit worried. Doing my best to charm the woman in the reception I ended up with a &quot;deluxe&quot; room on the fifth floor facing Hyde Park. I really liked my room even though it was quite small (London...). Bed was great, two different types of pillows, a/c worked fine. One detail I really appreciated was the possibility to plug-in your i-pod to the little alarm-clock next to the bed. To avoid the sound of music you don't like from the TV. Breakfeast was very nice, fresh and good selection. Small sitting area though. Only downside is that there is only one lift, but that's all. Personally I could live with it..."
71,800,"Apr 3 2007 	Good value for London	Central location, old refurbished hotel. Very good value 2 nights B&amp;B with one dinner included. On arrival we were given a room at th back of the hotel which had the windows covered over and wired, it was impossible to see out! We returned to reception and complained and were immediately offered a complimentary upgrade. This room though not large looked out over the park, was clean and quite adequate for a 2 night stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, dinner was OK but lacking any ambiance. Breakfast was plentiful with lots of variety but on one morning there were no tables available and we had to eat sitting in the lounge at a coffee table - not ideal"
72,800,"Mar 12 2007	Nice Staff - Central location	My husband and I went for my 30th Birthday - the hotel knew this and sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate, which was very much appreciated. The staff were very helpful and always around when we had a question. The rooms where nice and clean, bathroom bit small but clean. The girl that cleaned the room every day was very good and we recieved a daily paper delived to the door each morning, with out charge. The breakfast was brill everything from fresh fruit to a fry. We really enjoyed our trip and the hotel staff helped alot. Thanks - would go back again and bring the family!!!! If you stay at this hotel the Tube Station is at the corner of the hotel as well as the bus stop - Number 94 takes you to Oxford street and Regent Street and the Number 148 takes you to Victoria Station, excellent routes."
73,800,"Mar 7 2007	Not Good But Not Bad Either	We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in November. I've certainly stayed in much nicer hotels, but given the price and the location, I'd say it was decent. Though the tube station next door was closed for renovations 2 of the four days we were there, there is another station two blocks away. As a result, traveling around the city is fairly easy. (And you can't beat its proximity to Kensington Palace...just a 5 minute walk through the park.) They put us in a upgraded room, but it was still pretty small (even by European standards). The only major issue I had was that they mistakenly scheduled our wake up time for 6:00 a.m. instead of 5:00 a.m., so we weren't woken up until the cab arrived at 5:45 a.m. to take us to Victoria Station to catch the Gatwick Express. Everything turned out alright in the end, but that was a fairly stressful way to end our trip to London. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this hotel if you're looking to spend a lot of time in your room -- but who goes to London to spend time in their room?"
74,800,"Feb 28 2007 	Good Choice if You Don't Need Extravagance	I stayed here in February for a two night business trip. The biggest plus was the room was very clean - a problem I've had at other London hotels - including the private bath. The staff was also quite friendly and responded to all requests with a smile. And you can't beat the location. Very short trip to/from Paddington, and accessible to/from the rest of the city, both business and tourist districts. There didn't seem to be much in the way of high quality restaurants around, although I didn't really look too hard for them. The buffet breakfast that was included with the room was nothing special, but again decent. Be aware that it offers a lot of carb-heavy dishes, although there was a reasonable selection of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereal. The only true negative was the room size. I had a single which was probably seven feet by ten feet, plus the bathroom and closet. It was enough to fit a desk, nightstand, bed and television set with just enough walking room in between. Again, I've had this same problem at other London hotels. If you're not claustrophobic or hold very high expectations, this is a good hotel choice."
75,800,"Feb 22 2007	Not bad!	Stayed for a weekend in mid febuary. Very handy location, queensway tube next door! The hotel is very clean and staff very friendly, the room we had was stated as a 'delux' room. It was very cosey to say the least, good standard of furnishing all round but everything on the small side, the bathroom was tiny. We also experianced a fair amount of traffic noise at night when trying to sleep, the hotel is situated on a very busy road and the traffic is constant untill 3am but even after then does not become that quiet. Take some earplugs if u are a light sleeper like me!We had dinner included in the price on our first night and i'm glad it was free because the 25 for 3courses is massivley overpriced for the quality of the food. They seem to try hard but its of a very average standard. The breakfast on the other hand is very good, loads of choice and eat as much as you want.We found the hilton hyde park a decent place to stay overall but maybe a little overpriced for the standard given."
76,800,"Feb 10 2007 	BAD experience again	This was my 6th. stay in the Hyde Park Hilton and the worst one ever.All rooms are different, some recently remodeled, some awful awful awful... not at all Hilton standard (not even the remodeled rooms). This time I had a Deluxe room and that was a joke! Noisy (elevator noise kept me awake all night), twin bed was uncomfortable, light from the corridor came through to the room, the windows were blocked (light beige semi-transparanet tape, so I couldn't see daylight!!!!!), A/C didn't work, breakfast was so-so...The front officer (French?) guy was nice, but all in all lots of staff whose English was BAD! I really hope next time I get a room in another hotel. My company has deals with several hotels and Hyde Park Hilton seems to be one of the few hotels that has vacant rooms when booked last minute."
77,800,"Jan 30 2007 	A fine stay	Stayed the w/e for my wife's 40th - we had a great time (except for Gatwick security going home on Sunday night - an absolute shambolic disgrace). Anyway, we chose this hotel for its location and it was spot on - 2 tube stations on the doorstep, Kensington Gardens just opposite, Queensway and the excellent Whiteleys shopping centre just a few minutes away. All we needed was a decent room with a good breakfast - we weren't disappointed. We'd stay here again. Yes, we get the point about it not exactly being a true Hilton, so what, unless you plan to live in your room the whole time. The staff were very helpful throughout and unless you're looking for luxury, I'd recommended this Hotel to friends"
78,800,"Dec 31 2006 	A real nightmare	I have stayed at dozens of Hiltons across the world and this was the worst, with an overall quality very far below Hilton standards. Actually, I was surprised that this &quot;hotel&quot; is called a Hilton.Since I had to switch between some rooms on my first day (in an attempt to find an acceptable one), I can assure you that even the so-called Deluxe rooms were so tiny that you could barely walk around the bed. The walls were thin and the doors badly isolated with the light of the hall penetrating the rooms. The windows were bolted hermetically shut, the air conditioning was not working. Thus, the only chance I had to get some fresh air was to open a small window in the bathroom. The bedspread was clean but worn out, the curtains were dirty and mold was evident on the walls, the windows and the bathroom. There were 5 TV channels but no cable TV. Minibar was not available and the shaver outlet was not working. The built-in wardrobe was useless, due to a grave constructional defect.The quality of the breakfast was acceptable but the service in the restaurant awful. Apart from two bellmen and a young lady serving at the restaurant, who were friendly, attentive and efficient, the staff of this hotel were confused, disinterested, had in most cases no good command of English and were unprofessional."
79,800,"Dec 17 2006 	What a dump	What a terrible place to stay in. Its a circus not a hotel. We arrived at 2.45 to be told the room will not be ready for another hour and a half!!!! What a joke. Then we were told they could provide us a single room to get ready in so that we can get to a wedding in time. OK we felt like sardines in a can, it was ridiculous. When we eventually got back and got our room, we decided to order room service. The choice was pathetic - 5 sandwiches... So we ordered a sandwich which took 30 mins to arrive, only to be stale. The mini bar had left over food from previous guests, that was not cleared away by anyone. How disgusting! I feel the rooms are tiny, the service is aweful, and noone listens to anything you say. If you wish to throw money away, give it to the poor, but do not stay in that rat hole."
80,800,"Nov 23 2006 	location location location	My wife and I have stayed at this hotel many times and it is out favourite of many in London.The key factors are location and quality.It is located reasonably centrally but literally next door to an underground station with another on a different line only 5 minutes away. Hyde Park is across the road, with huge potential to escape from the madness of London. There are many varied restaurants very nearby as well as shops.The hotel itself seems small for a Hilton and is an old building. Some of the rooms are small and can be a bit stuffy in the full heat and fumes of London but generally are very acceptable by London standards.The staff are consistantly wonderful and so helpful.Breakfast is excellent, although not quite as good as when it was a Stakis hotel. Dinner leaves a lot to be desired and the dining room tends to be very quiet. We usually stay on a package that includes some dinners and these represent tremendous value for money, but otherwise we would not choose to dine there."
81,800,"Nov 23 2006 	Started bad ended ok	My experience with this hotel started out quite terribly, but I have to commend the staff and management for making an effort to improve the situation. The best thing about this hotel is it's location: Right on Hyde Park and practically on top of the queensway tube station. Most of the rooms are TINY. I know this because I switched between several rooms on my first day. All of them were so small you could barely walk around the bed. And bear in mind, these were the &quot;Deluxe&quot; rooms! (I was upgraded since I am a Hilton Hhonors Gold VIP member). The rooms contents are ok - the bed is comfortable, linen is nice, there is a desk, Tv, etc. Everything is Small but cleand and ok. Nothing like Hiltons in the US or elsewhere in the world - but ok for UK standards, which I've learned are... &quot;different&quot;. The main problem I had with this hotel was the maintenance - when I got there I was told the A/C does not work in 90% of the rooms &quot;due to maintenance&quot; issue. I was about to spend the entire week there and they did not think the A/C would be fixed during the week. (These kind of issues are something that I would expect the hotel to state on their website!!). The first room I checked into was so hot and stuffy I could barely breath in it. I asked for a fan, but there were none. The windows only opened a crack and didn't help much. The phone didn't work so I had to go down to the lobby with every question I had until the phone got fixed. Then, just as I was getting ready for a mjor business conference call I find out the internet does not work in this particular room (#410). I missed my conference call and was furious. I was switched to another room (#414) - also deluxe, same size (tiny), still no A/C (but wasn't nearly as hot for some reason), but at least the internet worked (for 15 GBP per day) and the phone did too. After some complaining, the manager called my room and offered 50% discount on my first night and promised to switch me to another room with A/C the next day. The management kept their promise and I was switched to nicer room the next day. This one was slightly bigger and nicer (Room #407) and - finally - all the electrical appliances were working (including A/C). The other main complaint about this hotel is the noise - the street noise is very loud - but I guess that comes with the location. In the end, the last room I had was defintiely ok, and I was pleased with the management responses to my complaints and how they handled the situation (though I was disappointed with the low quality of maintenance of the hotel). I did receive 50% discount on the room rate for all the sta, after all. Bottom line: kudos on the service, low marks on the hotel itself. I will not be staying there again."
82,800,"Oct 22 2006	Depends on the room they give you	I stayed at the Hyde Park Hilton for a business trip. This being my 2nd time in London in 1 month I knew what to expect from the hotels --small rooms, small lifts, etc. When we arrived at 12 am, they said they did not have non-smoking rooms as requested. The agent told me that he only had smoking rooms, so my colleague went up to the room to check it out to see if she could stand it. While she as upstairs, the agent started to get my info. He saw that I was a Hilton Honors member and then immediately said that he DID have non-smoking available. He checked us in right away.My assigned room was cute, I thought and comfortable. The shower had mold on it, which would be tough for me due to a mold allergy. My colleague on the other hand, wanted to switch rooms. She was in a lower level, with windows that were blacked out and she didn't feel safe. They moved her to a &quot;deluxe&quot; room on the corner overlooking the park. Meanwhile my first night was comfortable, however in the morning I noticed something strange. There were about a dozen bees at my window trying to get in! It was really creepy. Their windows are set up to have the old windows and then they inserted a newer set of windows in front. So it is old window, curtain, new window. Luckily I had shut my window the night before, otherwise the bees would have been in my room in the morning. Anyway, the bees were really creeping me out. (check out the pictures) I asked for another room because of the bees and the front desk agent showed no emotion when I told her there were bees, she just said, &quot;I don't know if we have another room&quot;, to check back when I come back from work that day. She didn't even acknowledge what I said, it was like she knew that there was a bee problem in that room. I came back from work and they had assigned me room 105, on a lower level. The room was smaller than my previous room, the window looked out to A/C units and a rooftop. I did not have cell phone service, which was critical to keep in touch with family in the U.S. and for business reasons. So, I asked them to move me again. This time I was smart like my colleague and asked them to move me to a room facing the street. They did and what a difference! The rooms facing the front are bigger and cleaner. The only reason that I gave this hotel a 3 rating is because the staff was very friendly (besides the bee incidence and her lack of empathy or acknoledgement). The concierge/bellman was so polite and went out of his way to help us every time. Also, they were willing to move me when I asked."
83,800,"Aug 7 2006 	Excellent one night stay and was up-graded	Booked a one-night stay thru hotels-- and was very pleased. They have a secure luggage room that only the concierage can open, so your bags are safe if your room isn't ready. We were upgraded for whatever reason to a deluxe room overlooking Hyde Park. The entire place seemed entirely refurbrished. (This is the old Coburg Hotel, used in the Alfred Hitchcock move &quot;Frenzy&quot;. The lobby wasn't altered a lot from when the movie was shot in 1972. If you ever stay here, you must see the video). One tube line next door (Queensway on the District Line) and one a half a block away (Bayswater on the Circle Line). If your breakfast is not included, there's a little bistro next door."
84,800,"Aug 2 2006 	Not Up To Standard for the price ....Hyde Park Hilton	Not Up To Standard for the price ....Hyde Park Hilton Date: June 3 rd 2006My wife and I wanted to stay in a Hotel in London that would have a good level of service and comfort, so we thought Hilton would meet the requirements . Well we were wrong ! When we arrived at the Hyde Park Hilton in May it was undergoing repainting and construction.... some thing that Hilton forgot to tell prospective guests. As we stepped our way through the mess we thought , Oh well the room will be alright ...wrong !The Hotel was under repair, the room was small,the air conditioning didn't work, the tube station next door was also being reconstructed so it could not be used and noises were heard through the night as they did their work, the internet connection did not work in all rooms. We know as we wer moved to three different rooms trying to find one that had everything working, What was worse was that Hilton management were difficult to find and were somewhat indifferent to the issues....Oh I see, complaining American's.Add this to $28 for per person breakfast, same thing at down town pub, $8 ! The extremely small room at the rear and was american low price &quot;motel&quot; standard (say $90 no more value) for nearly $300 a night and it spoiled our stay in LondonHilton was just full of excuses, and only when really pressured did anything to make things better.kevin lane"
85,800,Jul 27 2006 	Good hotel for a london trip	Stayed there in July. Good hotel - Tube next door - breakfast excellent. Would stay there again. For that price a good hotel. Ask for a renovated room.
86,800,"Jul 21 2006	Good location ok hotel	Recent stay at the London Hilton on Hyde Park. Right across from the park and around the corner from the tube and busses, so location was excellent. Breakfast was included with the room and was excellent. Staff was helpful and friendly. Rooms were ok, but nothing special. Otherwise I would give this hotel a top rating."
87,800,"Jul 14 2006	First time visitor to the UK	We were so impressed with the service, the helpful staff in every way. We could not say enough for our most pleasant stay. We will recommend this to our friends. The breakfast was super, and had a variety of foods. The location was just perfect. We enjoyed the park every evening during our stay. We used the subway system and found the hotel very convenient. Once again we had a wonderful visit and plan to return again. Thanks for providing a restful and informative vacation."
88,800,"Jul 2 2006	Perfect first visit to London	Needing to insure my husband had high speed internet access our travel agent booked the Hilton Hyde Park. Flying overnight from Boston we arrived at the hotel at 9:30am and were pleased to be told a room would be ready for us in 20 minutes. We were served tea and coffee in the library lounge and in 20 minutes our room was ready.It was a lovely room with a window overlooking the Black Lion gate to Kensington Park. The bed was cozy and the room spacious and nicely decorated.The staff was always helpful and friendly whether we were interacting with people at the front desk, the bar, or the restaurant. The high speed internet access worked everytime it was needed.The continental breakfast offers a good variety and was quite plentiful.We would stay at the Hilton Hyde Park again and recommend others do also."
89,800,"Jun 27 2006	hotel staff below par	We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights during June 06. My husband, son and I stayed in one room, and my parents stayed in another.When my parents checked in, the hotel gave them a very dark and dirty room (probably unrenovated) with no view under the excuse that their &quot;real room&quot; was not ready. My father took it because he was assured that he would be relocated to his real room once it was ready. But when he went to the front desk to inquire, was told that his real room was now taken by someone else (within a matter of a couple of hours!). My father, being a life long Hilton customer, wrote an angry complaint to the hotel (via some &quot;comment box&quot;) and the next day, was give a better room. The hotel staff gave the excuse that they didn't know my father was a &quot;gold member&quot; or whatever; their excuse was beside the point.The hotel promised us room on the same floor as my parents, but when we checked in, we were not given that room. Instead, the staff changed the subject and urged us to take a room that was ready then, because our &quot;real room&quot; was not ready yet. Hmm, heard that one before? The staff I dealt with did not speak English very well and what he kept saying was very confusing. We held our ground, insisting that we have a room on the same floor as my parents, and finally, someone equivalent to a manager came out and apologized that there were no rooms left on my dad's floor but that they would give us a really nice room if we waited 3 hours until 3pm. So we did.The rooms were very small with limited drawer space but clean and decent. Ours was renovated and everything, except the shaver electric outlet, seemed to be in place. We could not stick any plug in the shaver outlet and my husband had to go without shaving the entire stay. My parents room was not renovated yet, but was clean enough as well. Theirs was what the hotel called a &quot;deluxe room&quot; but besides the existence of a mini-bar, I didn't see the difference. Their shaver outlet was broken down too and so was the mini-bar fridge.When dad called to have it fixed, the staff said she would have someone right up, but when nobody came after 30 minutes, we called again only to be told by someone else that the maintenance guy was not in that day. The hotel didn't have the courtesy to call back to inform us that.This is just one example of how confused the staff are. Everybody seems to say something different, and they don't seem to know much about what is going on. We borrowed a step-down electric converter from the hotel but nobody seemed to know that and was confused when we tried to return it. On the other hand they charged my dad everything in the minibar even though he didn't touch anything. By the end of the stay we had deep distrust for the staff and could not rely on the hotel to give us a morning call because we feared our request might be lost. We had to re-iterate our request over and over again.Hotel location was great especially because we were with a toddler. There was a fabulous playground nearby. But the majority of hotel staff were not up to par, did not have good command of English and seemed to have communication problems among themselves."
90,800,May 23 2006	Good Hotel	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 10 nights during our vacation to London. Our experience with the facilities and staff at this hotel was very good. On our initial stay of 6 nights we had a double room which was adequate for 2 people. The room was clean and daily service by the staff was excellent.We left London and returned for 3 additional nights and the duty manager upgraded our room to the deluxe room. This was really very nice. The hotel is located very conviently to the Bayswater tube station. The Queensway tube station which is located by the hotel was closed for improvemnents during our stay. The hotel is located in close proximity to the Kensington gardens and lots of restaurants in the area.
91,800,"May 4 2006 	Nice Location	I stayed in the hotel for 2 weeks while on a business trip. The hotel was under renovation at the time. My room had not yet been renovated but it was still in decent shape. I had a &quot;Deluxe Plus&quot; room with 2 twin beds. The room was really small and there wasn't much room between the desk and the bed. The hotel itsself is in a great location right across from Kensington Gardens/Hyde Park. The Queensway tube station is underneath the hotel and Bayswater station is just around the corner and up a couple of blocks. Overall, I felt the hotel was in a great location for getting around the city."
92,800,"Apr 18 2006	Great location good clean hotel	After securing a great deal on the internet for this hotel, and then reading some of the reviews on this website I expected the worst, especially as it was Easter bank holiday and the hotel would be busy. However I was actually very pleased with the hotel. My room was recently re-decorated and was clean and bright with a great view of the park. The location of the hotel is ideal and the staff were very polite and pleasant. I would definitely stay again, especially when the special rates are applicable."
93,800,"Mar 24 2006	Not in a good shape	I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my wife as a treat for her birthday. The hotel is in a nice spot opposite Hyde Park so it's ideal if you want to cut across to Kensington. The hotel itself though is very dated and really needs some TLC and/or good management. The rooms are very drab and worn and the bathrooms are ancient and they only provide enough shower gel for one wash? Most odd in a Hilton.When we visited a lift was out of order and one room had it's 'no smoking' sign stuck on with duct tape and it was so obvious that there was no maintenance person. We had Breakfast on one day and it was not very nice, the spread was good and promised much but the food was cold and tasteless but the service for the tea etc was good. Drinks are very expensive in the bar so I'd avoid that one.If you stay here and want to venture out I would recommend that you keep some cash for a taxi as it's a long walk to the nearest anything.Oh and when you leave don't allow the concierge to book you a taxi, he told us 10 for a taxi to the high street and when we got one ourselves from across the road it was 5!The staff are nice and helpful but this place really needs a shake up.We got a late deal so can't complain about the cost but if we'd paid full rates we'd have been very upset.Come on hotel, shake it up because you have real potential."
94,800,Mar 22 2006	Good Location	Stayed over weekend and found no problems with the hotel at all.Built on the Queensway tube station which is closed until May but the bayswater tube is only 100m away.No problems from the construction work at Queensway never heard a thing.Breakfast room seems small for size of hotel and you are given a small note advising you to avoid 08.30 until 09.30 (busy time)but we had no problem either day.reception small and a bit dated but staff ok.Location for us was very good .1.25mile from marble arch (start of oxford street)tube 100m and buses 30m from the door.We went on the low rate weekend deal but I would have been dissapointed if I had paid the advertised (in reception )prices.Queensway at the side of the hotel is a great street with restaraunts pubs and even an ice rink and is a very lively place with a shopping centre .All in all we enjoyed it.Rooms not badly sized althogh no view at the back but clean warm and confortable.
95,800,"Mar 12 2006	we got robbed..	I stayed at this hotel 6th to 10th march with my boyfriend for my birthday holiday break.despite the hall is very small and we had left our suitcases and stuff on the chairs just 2 metres opposite the reception desk while checking in..my boyfriend got his valuable camera stolen, nobody saw a thing. the staff couldnt check the security records but had to wait 2 days for the police to come and do it. apparently it had been a team job of 2 men, 1 inside the hall, the other on the street, talking on the mobile to give instructions and when nobody was looking,camera was gone! the man in the hall was surely dressed as a businees man so being a hilton nobody suspected a thing. there should be somebody at the entrance to check who comes in and out, if not security, a bell boy would do, just to see if the person arrived needs to check in or steal stuff around..after this we got a small room, back facing, with view over the 1st floor roof and buildings walls, leaving just a tiny space to see a bit of sky. renovating works were still on but going on fast and not giving any trouble, even if we could hear drilling in the morning, not clear if from the hotel or tube station right under. our room was the first under 3 steps in the corridor and the door was not certainly noise proof as we could hear every step taken outside. the hairdryer in the bathroom was noisy as the engine of an airplane but not as powerful.. breakfast was very good but it's not clear how such a big hotel has a such small dining room.on our second day we asked for an umbrella at the reception, nice and big..which we returned the day after, but on departure day we saw it charged for 25 pounds!they thought we had kept it.. infact they had asked me the room number when i took it but not when i gave it back..smart eh!for each day they also charged 2 pounds for some charity fare, with no notice about it previously.all in all for what we paid, being mt boyfriend hilton staff too he had special fare for 30pounds a night with breakfast, it was ok, surely not valuable the usual rates. if u ever go there just pay extra care to ur stuff! never lose sight of it!"
96,800,"Mar 10 2006	Be careful	Got to the hotel and went to the reception to check in. My Camera was stolen within 20 seconds after I entered the hotel in a lobby 3m x 3m. Staff couln't use the CCTV. Police seems to take care of it after reporting it. Receptionists at the hotel don't check who comes and goes in that hotel, a bomb could easily be placed there, they won't even notice!!As a Hilton Employee myself, I must say this is the WORST Hilton in the Hilton Hotel Chain!!"
97,800,"Feb 28 2006	Construction Zone Hotel	There is construction going on in this hotel and next to this hotel 7 days a week, including Sundays. In any room, you can hear continuous hammering and drilling going on all day long, including sunday morning. The hotel is renovating the stairwell and elevator areas and in addition, there is a tube station construction zone immediately east of the hotel and this work goes on 7 days a week. Additionally, the mattresses and pillows are hard, the king size bed was really queen sized, and the quality overall is just not up to Hilton standards. We ordered flowers to be present in our room on arrival, but the flowers came without a vase and we had to call repeatedly over two days before we got a vase, which was a pitcher wrapped up in aluminum foil. I would not stay in this hotel again nor recommend it to anyone."
98,800,"Feb 25 2006	If you stay here insist on a renovated room	How bad could it be, the location is ideal, and all I want is a clean bed and shower, I thought when I made my reservation at the Hilton Hyde Park. I was to find out, pretty bad.The Hyde Park Hilton appears to be undergoing renovations and maybe it will be better in a few months, but right now you are taking your chances. Upon checking in I was shown to a room that undoubtly doubles as a movie set for a down-on-his luck drug dealer's flat! The carpet was threadbare, the bedspread looked about 30 years old, not dirty, just worn out. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, there were stains on everything and what looked like mold along the wall close to the window. I refused to stay in the room, it was that bad. The bellboy, bless him, was a savior and he called to the front desk and suggested a different room which was freshly painted, clean, and with new covers and pillows on the bed. The staff was for the most part delightful, they were helpful and courteous, made calls to check on restaurants for me, called cabs, carried my bags, etc, they really raised my overall impression of the place. However, I did have trouble with the breakfast wait staff who insisted my rate did not include breakfast and announced this rather loudly to the entire dining room without asking if I would like to eat there anyways. After a quick check, it was included, but still when I checked out, there was an additional charge. I am still trying to work that out. I got the impression that this is a very inexperienced company running this hotel and that once the renovations are complete (there were wet paint signs everywhere) and the staff procedures in place it will be ok. Until then, you are taking your chances."
99,800,"Feb 6 2006	Hilton Hyde Park hotel	Last week I stayed in this squalid little place. For any hotel, this was dreadful, for a Hilton it was completely devestating.To anyone who may visit my home city of London, please do not waste your hard earned cash in this place."
100,800,Nov 11 2005 	Not Hilton standard	We stayed here for three nights and were very dissapointed. We have stayed at a dozen different Hilton hotels around the world and this is easily the worst of them.Bad things:*The staff was unprofessional.*We had a deluxe room but it was still very cramped.*The interior is old and dirty.*Thin walls and badly isolated doors.*Some maintenance was heard all during the day(drilling?) maiking it impossible to rest.*Expensive.*Only 6 tv channels. No CNN.Good things:*The complemenatry breakfast was good.*Very good location.All in all we would never stay here again.
101,800,"Aug 1 2005	Truly Awful	This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only reason it didn't get the lowest rating was that the staff are very polite and curteous at all times. However, the hotel itself is in desperate need of a refurb! Initally we thought we had stepped back in time to the 1970s. The room was shabby. The net cutains were dirty, the shower door did not open and close properly, there was paint peeling off the ceiling in the bathwork and the light from the hall penetrated the room to a disturbing degree.In all, the hotel was poor and we will never be staying again, indeed, having stayed a many Hiltons across the world this hotel means that I would re-think ever staying in one again."
102,800,"Jun 29 2005 	Worst Ever	I have just read some of the previous reviews and had to set the record straight. When I stayed at this 'hotel' I was amazed that it is called a Hilton.It had a grubby front foyer, the rooms were very tired and very small and the overall feel was more than disappointing.I was on a business trip, so it was easier to get on with it, not a place to go for a break."
103,800,May 28 2005	Very satisfied - would stay again	Stayed for a 2 night leisure break in May 05 - combined with Bryan Adams Concert - and everything went like clockwork. In fact we were upgraded to a junior suite which was particularly spacious for London and I'd requested a high floor so any street noise wouldn't affect us so we were very pleased. Staff friendly and helpful plus breakfast was brilliant with civilised times too at the weekend. Queensway station was closed at the time and we used Bayswater which was only a 5 minute walk away. The hotel is well situated opposite Black Lion Gate entrance to Hyde Park which puts you near Kensington Palace - the Orangery there was well worth a visit for afternoon tea. Our package included dinner on the first night which we changed to the 2nd with no problem and the food was good but the atmosphere was lacking as there were only a few other tables being occupied. All in all good value break with no niggles at all.
104,800,"May 21 2005	it has its ups and downs	stayed at this hilton property for 6 nights. staff was corteous but not very responsive. plus: location. it's built right over queensway station. beware that this tube stop will be closed for refurbishings for one year! so you might consider noise levels. it's opposite hyde park and convenient to shopping, eating (although quite expensive) and public transport. the room was spacious, but didn't have a/c. i would rate cleanliness a 5 stars!minuses: although i am a smoker couldn't open the windows for fresh air. no ice machines available and the staff, sometimes very friendly and sometimes...... not.but for the price i payed (99) i still consider this one of the best bargains you can get in london. beware of staying there in the hot months though!"
105,800,"Apr 13 2005	decent	clean, decent-sized rooms (i was alone), back of hotel not too bad, had view of other apartment buildings and greenery, good location near tube stations, short walk to several &quot;high streets&quot;, fairly safe area, nice-looking but old hotel, elevator is small, area is suitable for young people in their late teens and early twenties, across the street from hyde park, presentable staff, i got a cheap rate for my stay in november around thanksgiving (80 pounds per night - including taxes!)"
106,800,"Mar 19 2005 	Lousy place to stay	I visited this 'so called hotel' in August 2004. Firstly, the reception area of this hotel had 2 sofa's which they called the lounge. I mean, this was supposed to be a 3 star hotel ! The elevator could fit 2 people &amp; 1 suitcase and that was it. The rooms were really tiny like pigeon holes.You had to stand in a que to get to the breakfast table which was badly furnished.I'm used to Hotels in Asia, where if they charge you 250 US$ per night, they give you fabulous service. All in all, a lousy place to stay."
107,800,"Mar 3 2005	No pool or gym but ...	We stayed at Hyde Park Hilton from 1-3 March 2005. Location excellent as right beside Queensway tube station, room had beautiful uninterrupted views of park opposite, breakfast/evening meal delicious, staff very friendly and helpful, room/bathroom very clean and comfortable. Only negative - room too hot but there was a fan. Would definitely recommend this hotel for the 2 night break inclus of 2 breakfasts and one night's dinner. We will return ..."
108,800,"Jan 17 2005	GOOD LOCATION	We got a good deal here, 2 nights, 2 people, dinner on 1st night and breakfast both days - 169. Got upgraded on arrival to room overlooking the park. Had all ameneties, trouser press, tea/coffee, mini bar. Staff were excellent. The location was right outside the tube station so not much walking. Breakfast was great and buffet style. We couldnt fault this hotel! Definately stay again. Rooms were slightly hot, but open the windows before you go out for the evening and you'll be fine."

1,801,Great Hotel	My husband and two teenagers stayed at the Hilton Islington from November 20-26. We arrived at the hotel at 10:00 a.m. and our rooms weren't ready until after 1:00 p.m. but the hotel staff did everything possible to make us feel comfortable. We reserved a double room for me and my husband and a twin room for the kids. Our son came over from Swansea and stayed in the twin room and the kids weren't crowded. Both rooms were very clean and there was plenty of room to get around. We had questions every day for the concierge and they were very helpful.
2,801,"Oct 12 2009 	Good location good room good staff	Stayed in this hotel for a weekend as we'd come up for a friends wedding. We got there early but they found us a room we could go to straight away. The room was a reasonable size, not huge but not too crowded either. Bathroom was a good size and the bed was comfy. Situated on Upper Street, a five minute walk from Angel Tubse station, it really is in a good location.Breakfast is a buffet affair but there is almost everything you could want. Breads, cereals, pastries, full english. The coffee was weak and it was a little chaotic but they didn't rush us which was nice.They even let us check out late and didn't charge us for the priveledge, always worth an ask!I'd go back to this hotel but definitely worth looking for special offers, its not cheap!"
3,801,"Oct 2 2009 	had higher expections	stayed at hilton back in march (only getting around to my reviews now). from what i remember, the OH booked on hotwire and we got a good deal.While the lobby, bar, leisure etc are all fantastic, we felt the rooms were a bit shabby...ours smelled of past smokers..which is a pet hate of mine. Also, housekeeping kept trying to come into our room every morning, despite the do not disturb sign on the door..another pet hate.Location was good - we knew where it was. Would recommend it if you get a &quot;deal&quot; but dont think id book at the rates on hiltons own site."
4,801,"Sep 15 2009 	Great Hotel	I have read the reviews before I traveled and thought is it possible. It's too good to be true, but after being there I agree with every word. The rooms are nice the service is good, breakfast is good and you get a good value for your money."
5,801,"Sep 13 2009 	One of the best	Before I start,I have to say I love chain hotels.I have travelled to London on business every few weeks for the last 5 years and stayed in most of the Hilton hotels.I do not need the luxury 5 star which are often disappointing and generally find that good four star hotels are better.I have no idea why this hotel was not on my radar as I am always on the lookout for a good deal.Yes this hotel is modern,but you get more space for your money than most in London.Staff were exceptionally kind,I have never been in any hotel anywhere in the world where the staff smiled so much,a credit to the Manager who should be suitably rewarded.I had the basic room which was large for London,at the rear of the hotel which made it exceptionally quiet for central London and could not complain about a thing.Breakfast was the usual Hilton good quality but Pawel ran it with outstanding efficiency,I wish I could employ him in my company.For our visitors I just want to add,Islington is seriously cool and highly fashionable in London.There are loads of restaurants and bars in the area and it is 'the place' to see and be seen in London,so would probably suit the younger crowd.The whole hotel was immaculate and staff just fabulous,I will book again."
6,801,"Sep 8 2009 	Excellent clean efficient hotel in a brilliant location!	I stayed at the Hilton Islington with my girlfriend for a few days at the beginning of September. The staff in the hotel were brilliant, super friendly and knowledgable as they recommended a brillitan chinese restaurant just up the street. The hotel is situated on upper street with plenty of restaurants, bars, shops and cafes if you dont fancy taking a tube/taxi on an evening. We found this to be the best thing about the hotel. The rooms are spotless and big however as with all hiltons extras are incredibly expensive. The tube station 'Angel' is about 5mins walk meaning sightseeing is very easy."
7,801,"Aug 27 2009 	Always a wonderful stay at the Hilton Islington	We have stayed at the Hilton, Islington twice now and on both occasions have been impressed by the standards &amp; service at the hotel. Rooms are good size, staff are efficient and pleasant. We were worried on this trip as we were given the first room off reception and we thought it might be small &amp; noisy, but the room was excellent in every respect. This hotel is ideally situated on Upper St, just around the corner from Angel tube station. We usually stay here for attending matches at the Emirates and its perfect!"
8,801,"Aug 26 2009 	Great Hotel Decent Location	My daughter and I stayed at the Hilton Islington last week for four nights. We also got the two for one deal which made this a fantastic place to stay. The room was large(ish) and the air conditioning worked great, nice bathroom. Islington is a great area with tons of cute restaurants, pubs and shops. There was a full breakfast buffet included in our room rate. From Heathrow we took the Picadilly Line to Kings Cross and transfered to the Northern Line to Angel. The hotel is a few minutes walk from the Angel tube stop. The only drawback to this hotel is that the Northern line isn't the most convenient line to be on. It took us at least 45 minutes, usually an hour to get around town. We had to change trains at least once to get anywhere. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because the rate that we paid made it worth it. I would definitely consider staying here again if I could get a similar rate."
9,801,Aug 19 2009 	Bargain stay!	A great hotel in a nice area close to the centre and a stones throw from Angel tube. We got a very good deal on Hilton.com booking 2 nights for the price of 1. We were plesantly shocked to discover this also included a full breakfast every morning of our stay! A bonus! The hotel was very clean and the receptionists were very helpful with check in being very quick. I hope to visit this hotel again in the near future.
10,801,Aug 12 2009	Excellent hotel for a short stay	We booked this hotel after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. We got a great deal of 2 nights stay for the price of 1 including breakfast. On arrival we were checked in very quickly and were allocated a Club King room on the 4th floor. This surpassed our expectations as the deal was for a double room. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We would stay again if we could get another good deal....................
11,801,"Aug 10 2009 	Good location.... shame about the windows	Excellent customer service from the minute we arrived until the minute we left - from Front Desk, to Housekeeping, to Restaurant Staff: no complaints. Good location for restaurants and pubs, bars and coffee shops! Excellent spot for catching a bus to virtually anywhere and to and from mainline rail network. The only problem we had was a faulty bedroom window which was broken (and which we reported) - which meant that we had to use the air conditioning all of the time - which in these environmentally conscious times was a shame - as even though the windows are double glazed to cut down on noise, it felt claustrauphobic to never be able to open the window (during our four day stay)."
12,801,"Aug 4 2009 	Cheapish but very average hotel. Nice area not too far from city	Islington is certainly a pleasant part of London. Lots of restaurants, and you feel fairly safe. Its a short taxi trip away from the city. If you'd prefer to take the tube (5 min walk) then youre relying on the Northern line working, as its the only like that passes through the Anget tube station at Islington.The hotel lobby area is certainly 4 star. Unlike most 4 star hotels rather than opting for a minibar instead they have a vending machine as you exit the lift on your floor. Each floor has different machines. On my floor there was beer, small bottles of wine, or mini spirit bottles sticky-taped to mini coke cans, as well as toothbrushes, razors etc. Interesting idea but not what I'd expect from a Hilton. From the vending machine it was a short walk to my room down a rather dated and stale smelling corridor.I had a 'king' room (the standard rooms had sold out). There was a king sized bed and decent sized flat screen TV. There was a single-seater lounge chair in the corner, and a large unused area. I guess this area would be good if you were into pilates or yoga. I just cant work out why they didnt just put in a larger sofa. Luckily I was on my own. If I had a guest then where would they sit? Hmm.They supply bottled water, which is nice, but at 4 pounds a bottle I gave it a miss. Heres a hint - the water is cheaper at the vending machine.The room was very clean. However on two separate occasions the cleaner left a rubber glove in the bathroom sink. And one of the towels must have had a previous life in one of the smoking rooms.I used the iron, but this leaked dirty water onto my business shirt. This certainly isnt the first time that this has happened to me at a hotel and I had a spare shirt so I wasnt too worried... I think hotel irons get dropped quite often, so I cant really blame the hotel.The lighting in the room was quite dim. I think its because they have switched to compact fluoros to cust costs &amp; save the planet. They probably just made the mistake that most newbies make, believing the label when it says &quot;8W is equivalent to 60W incandescent&quot;, which of course is bollocks (to use the lingo). If you have trouble reading in dim room (which I do), either sit at the desk and use the desk lamp, or bring a decent torch.Internet wasnt cheap at 15 pounds a day. If youre staying for two days or more then heres a tip - pop down to the local &quot;3&quot; mobile shop and buy a prepaid mobile broadband dongle for 29 pound. A gig of download valid for 30 days costs 10 pound.My room key stopped working twice. I had to go down to the lobby and they just reprogrammed it and it was fine. Just a tip, dont risk going to the vending machine in your PJ's just in case you cant get back in and have to go down to the lobby.Sorry if I am being too negative. To even things up I have to say that the beds were very comfortable, the curtains blocked out the light well, and the room was certainly fairly big for London standards.Would I stay here again? Maybe. London hotels at this price are hard to find, and beggars cant be choosers."
13,801,"Aug 3 2009	Hilton Islington	I spent two nights staying at the Hilton, Islington, London as it was convenient for a course my husband and I were attending in the City. We checked in and found our room to be comfortable and clean. The staff were really helpful throughout our stay and the position of the hotel is ideal for sightseeing and within walking distance of the tube.I have to admit, I usually hate chain hotels as they all seem the same world wide, but the warm welcome from the staff at this Hilton made our stay very enjoyable, the staff were attentive without being bothersome. We had dinner at the hotel both nights, the food was better than we expected and quite reasonable price wise. We booked a last minute deal and would certainly go back and stay there again, should we have to spend time in London. My only criticism is for the 15 per day fee for internet use in the bedroom. There is no wi fi and you have to attach a usb cable to your laptop, which meant only one of us could use a computer at a time."
14,801,Jul 29 2009 	Great Value	Only stayed one night. Very convenient. Very comfortable. Great location for exploring all that Islington has to offer. Excellent breakfast with plenty of choice. Superb value for money if you can get a deal.
15,801,"Jul 19 2009 	May not have been the absolute best choice as to location but good nevertheless.	I took so much advice from Trip Advisors Members before I finally booked at Hilton London Islington. I chose there because of the high cost of eating breakfast daily at the Hotel and because there were supposed to be lots of cafes close by where we would be able to get breakfast. Well that was absolutely true. We eat breakfast at small cafes close by every day and were very happy. The only thing is that Islington is not near to anything else; well it is near to the Angel Tube Station which we found handy. However when we wanted to go to aDinner/ Show we had to take Taxis and after the Show, wait quite a long time for the taxi tocome after we had called for it. The service at the Hotel was excellent: checking in and out - no problem; restaurant staff helpful and friendly and the Concierge Staff particularly Anthony exceptionally helpful. Anthony arranged our Dinner/Show for us and the taxi service to get to/from there, and also on leaving, our transport to Gatwick Airport by The Dot to Dot Express.Our experience at Hilton islington was very good."
16,801,"Jul 19 2009 	Not too close....not too far	My husband and I, along with my two sisters stayed in the Hilton London Islington on our very first trip to London. This hotel is in a great location. It is far enough away from the &quot;touristy&quot; areas, but it's a 5 minute walk to the underground (Angel line). AND, just add another 10 minute ride and you are in central London. As for us, we were also visiting friends who live in Islington so this was a perfect location for the group. I would recommend getting an oyster card or the London pass (check the zones when buying these cards as most sites are in Zones 1-3) if you are staying for longer that 5/7 days.  We booked the Executive Suite/Bed &amp; Breakfast package and it was lovely! Our bed was super comfortable with flatscreen TVs and the breakfast/ was very good - except for the scrambled eggs. They had a strange, watery yet (???) rubbery texture, but everything else was delicious (especially the variety of sausages, breads, and fruit).The toiletries (Evelyn &amp; Crabtree) were replenished daily as were the towels. There is also a coffee/tea maker in the room and bottled water. Excellent housekeeping and excellent reception. The staff is very accommodating and extremely helpful with dinner reservations and booking tours. All in all, top notch service.  The hotel is in a great neighborhood with tons of restaurants, pubs and shops. It was also a fraction cheaper going out to eat/drink and shop in this area. We spent a few days just exploring Islington and it reminded me a little bit of the the West Village in NYC. As I mentioned above, the underground is a VERY short walk and the buses are as just outside and will take you into the city center.  We had a wonderful time in London - absolutely LOVED it there and can't wait to go back this year in October!"
17,801,"Jul 15 2009 	Nice hotel near Tube	Location is near St. Pancears? where the Eurostar stops about 2 city blocks away. One of the reason this hotel was chosen. Hotel almost right across the street from Euston station. Walking distance to British Museum and British Library, for Southern Californian no less. Staff was excellent. Very helpful. Gave my daughter some candy when we checked in which of course made them happy. Room was decent size. Hotel was able to put 2 roll-a-way beds into the room at no additional charge. Room faced interior courtyard so there was nothing to see. But also no noise at all. Room had the basic, desk, iron etc. Nothing special. Bathroom also typical and clean. Hotel did give us bottle water and biscuits every day. Breakfast is good but typical. I made the mistake of having a 7AM flight out of LHR. Hotel was able to arrange car service to take us at a reasonable price."
18,801,"Jul 14 2009 	Excellent value for money	Booked this hotel through Londontown.com at a great weekend rate, including an excellent buffet breakfast . At first, I was doubtful to book because it was my first visit to London and I thought maybe I should look for a more central location, but this hotel proved to be a perfect choice. The center of the city on a summer weekend is a madhouse and the Islington location is not that far out. We had a nice 20 minute walk to the British Museum and when we wanted to get somewhere fast with the Angel tube stop at a 3 minute walk we could get anywhere in the center in less than 10 minutes, even on a Monday rush hour! The Islington area is lively and full of shops, bars and restaurants, but is relaxed enough to be a nice respite after a day in the city.The hotel is very nice, convenient, comfortable and modern. The rooms are great, very nice decor, big, extremely comfortable beds, everything looks brand new and is spotlessly clean. It's worth staying in Islington just to have this, everything in the center in its price bracket looked straight out of Man about the House. We also had a great view of the City skyline. The only negative I can say about this hotel is that it doesn't have minibars in the rooms and that the hallways are a little ugly. The brick walls don't look very appealing. The staff was absolutely brilliant, from the very nice gentlemen that checked us in at 3 am after a disastrous Ryanair flight, the very nice concierge, the great breakfast buffet servers and the very nice assistant manager that helped me retrieve a forgotten item in the room safe when I was running late for the flight back. Everybody seemed genuinely nice and caring about our stay. I will surely return on future trips to London and I've already recomended it to several friends."
19,801,"Jul 6 2009	Wonderful	After spending the previous 10 days at 3 hotels near Kings Cross, this Hilton was a fabulous relief. Beautiful room - twin - the beds bigger than usual. Front desk very helpful and courteous. Quiet. Enjoyed the location in Islington - 2 min. walk to tube station."
20,801,Jun 19 2009 	Good hotel just don't let them book you a mini-cab	Very warm welcome by Hanna on the honors desk and the staff were all smiley and efficient. The room service offered a good choice though the 5 tray charge is very high. The rooms were clean and quiet and the beds comfortable. I stayed on 2 separate nights and the service was consistent.However I asked them to book me a mini cab on my first stay and was quoted through the front desk 12 to Euston Road which was steep. The Crescent Cabs driver came in to find me and let me struggle with my case. He then tried to charge me 14 ! On the second stay I walked 100 yards to the main road and a black cab did the same journey for 8.20. So the hotel is great but stick to black cabs
21,801,"Jun 15 2009 	This was absolutely ideala great hotel.	This hotel was absolutely great. It was in a great location in Islington, amongst shops and restaurants and within a 5 minute walk of Angel tube. It was easy to drive to from the M40/A40 and lots of parking available, at reduced rates for the weekend. (60pence per hour) The beds were one of the most comfortable I have slept on. Room was very nice, with airconditioning. breakfast was huge, a grand buffet, with hot and cold. Staff were extremely pleasant, and helpful, and allowed us to check in early. All in all, a really nice,weekend break."
22,801,"May 25 2009 	Sometimes you get more than you pay for	Normally &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; and a bargain price at a central London hotel might send shivers down the spine of experienced travelers. But when you get a great discount price at a Hilton, you can be pretty sure you're not going to be shafted and we certainly weren't. I booked this hotel on Londontown.com because it came up with a rate of 65 pounds per night, prepaid. That's astonishing! Even better because the pound is low compared to the Canadian dollar. The credit card was charged $125 CAD per night. Islington is just a little away from the main centre of London but this hotel is a block from the Angel tube station and there are a number of busses that go by on Upper Street right outside that take you anywhere you might want to go. The location was ultra convenient for us because we arrived at St. Pancras International and were leaving by Euston. The hotel is away from the street so you don't get traffic noise either. It's beside a business centre so maybe that's why there are good deals on weekends, I'm not sure. We arrived about 7 p.m. and were checked in straight away with efficiency and a smile. The room was a basic double (queen size bed) but it was roomy and so was the bathroom. Bright and clean, the decor was muted tones and there was a nice lounge chair in addition to the large desk with ergonimic chair. The bed was comfy and the pillows felt like clouds. We ordered room service on our first night. The designated button on the phone didn't work but reception took my order and Room Service called back to confirm shortly after that. They delivered promptly when they said they would. The buffet breakfast was included in our prepaid rate, another bonus, and it has a wide variety of choice."
23,801,"May 8 2009 	Below par	Stayed here after a theatre visit in March 2008 and was not impressed. The service at check-in was cold and un-helpful which started the stay with a bitter note. Being a Hilton, I expected a lot better of the room which turned out to be very basic and, regrettably, not unlike Travelodges I've stayed in.Room service was painfully slow, overpriced and not at all worth it.Checking out was the deal sealer. The Greek gentleman was incoherent and seemingly couldn't understand much of the English language. He was rude, arrogant, ignorent, snappy and I could go on.All the place has really got going for it is the half-decent location for restaurants and Carling Academy etc and the bed's were pretty comfy. You'll find miles better in London!"
24,801,May 6 2009 	Another great stay	We arrive about 11.30am and we were checked in within 10mins including having a room ready for us.The room was clean - spacious We booked the Hotel using hilton honours points and it was room only - nearby is a great selection of restaurants - for breakfast we eat at a place called S/M lol a must place for all day breakfasts ( 2 full english - including toast and free refills of tea or coffee 14 )Back at the hotel staff checked us in online for our home flights and printed out our boarding cards ( no charge )My wife and i have stayed at the hotel about 5 times - we've had no problems in the past and none this time.The hotel is less than a 5min walk from the Angel tube station - some lovely antique shops nearby.All in all another great stay i'm sure well be back again in the furture - great helpful/friendly staff.jj.....
25,801,"May 4 2009 	Great hotel good location - excellent deal	Spacious room with loads of storage and different seats. Large bathroom too. We booked a great deal and they threw in breakfast on arrival too which was an enormous buffet selection of both hot and cold food from bacon to bagels to bran flakes and everything inbetween!It is located 5 minutes from Angel tube station and near to some really good shops, posh Islington High Street had some really nice restaurants and pubs.If we got a good deal again we'll definitely stay again."
26,801,Apr 23 2009	hilton islington	We stayed at the Hilton Islington for the last 2 nights of our month in the UK to be close to my daughter who lives in Islington. We were shown to a delux room and on and before entering it had a strong musty damp smell but thought that we would just put up with it as it was a bother to complain and change rooms. After spending one night in the room we both felt ill and could not even face up to breakfast. We did speak to the desk and to there defence they moved us to a suite which was extremely nice and we were very greatful. The staff helped us move and when we spoke to the Housekeeper she told us that the smell was from the carpet and the leak under the bath. I found that very annoying knowing they actually put us in there in the first place. When you left the lift it had a smell of being musty and mouldy.On the first night we had dinner in the restaurant and out of the 3 meals we ordered one was correct with the other 2 going back to the kitchen one for being cold and the other not being what was described on the menu so they replaced them after we spoke to the manager. The waiters didn't know what was what on the menu when questioned and had to keep running away to check but was very pleasant and apologetic as he normally was bar staff. Then there was the breakfast staff and that was another experience they stood around doing nothing looking at each other and talking and when we had finished we had to ask them to clear our table not to mention the cold tea and coffee. The actual breakfast buffet was very nice and the reception staff extremely helpful but the restaurant staff were hopeless.So in summing up I will never stay there again.
27,801,Apr 7 2009 	fantastic service	My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in April 09-every member of staff was so nice and courteous and friendly -couldn't do enough for you. Hotel handy to tube but best part was availabilty of buses-seemed you could go anywhere in london directly by getting on a bus from just outside the door-great hotel!!
28,801,"Mar 29 2009 	Great Place to Stay	Stayed here for one night, four adults, 2rooms. Both rooms were very clean &amp; comfortable. No problems at all. Great location, right in the heart of Islington. Will def stay here again."
29,801,"Mar 29 2009 	Fantastic deal at a central London Hotel	In London for a wedding locally. Got a great deal through Expedia. The rate was 67 for B&amp;B (inc taxes) for their standard double for both myself and my wife. Both the room (336) and en suite were large by central London standards, large bed, and flat screen TV. The above bath shower was powerful (not something I can say about many hotel showers) I don't know if the hotel has been recently decorated but the decor was immaculate. It looked out onto a quiet Islington backstreet. Breakfast was a very nice buffet with high quality produce all round. All of the staff were courteous and friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel especially if you can get a deal"
30,801,Feb 20 2009 	One of the best hotels outside central London	I have been a regular customer of the Hilton Islington. While it is outside the centre of London it is still only 15-20 minutes away by tube. But the area around the hotel has some very good bars and restaurants and is a very relaxing but cosmopolitan area. While the hotel has the feel of a business hotel it is perfect for shot visits.
31,801,"Feb 10 2009 	Great hotel to stay in	I booked this hotel after seeing an advert for the Hilton January Sale and I couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel.I have stayed at many hotels around the world and this hotel is well up there with the best I have stayed at.Location is good, the Angel tube station is only 5 mins walk up the road. This is on the Northern line and just one stop from Kings Cross tube/station which is central for must routes for the major attractions/areas to see in London.The room was lovely, very clean, decor up to date and big wide-screen telly in the room. I had breakfast included in my deal I was very pleased with the buffet style breakfast on offer, everything was well stocked.Staff were helpful at all times and couldn't have done more for you.Overall I would definately stay at this hotel again."
32,801,"Jan 31 2009 	I'd Stay Here Again	My fiance and I stayed at the Hilton from Dec. 26-28 and were very pleased with our stay. While we want to be comfortable when we travel, we also have to watch our budget since we're saving for a wedding in a few months. So when we found the Hilton for about $90/night, it seemed perfect. However, after reading some of the reviews, we remained cautiously optimistic. We weren't disappointed!The front desk was extremely welcoming and helpful. Upon mentioning that we were hungry, the concierge offered to locate a few restaurants on a map. He then gave us a run-down of a few attractions and events in the area. There's quite a bit of activity on the street: various restaurants and pubs, a Starbuck's and lots of shopping. The hotel is tucked away from the main road, so it's not too loud at night.The Angel tube station is only about three blocks away from the hotel. The station iteself is not in the most convenient part of the city. You have to switch lines a few times to get to the major parts of the city, but that's manageable as long as you're not returning to your room a lot.The room was very nice and spacious, especially compared to other hotels in cramped European cities. The bed wasn't the most comfortable bed I've slept in, but it worked.I would definitely stay here again, especially if I can get the same rate."
33,801,"Jan 26 2009 	Noisy waterworks and aircon - otherwise great!	Fantastic location, excellent facility. Great price too - delighted with the value for money in the Hilton January sale including a very good breakfast. Lovely staff - everyone was very helpful leading to a hassle-free stay. Comfortable room and free water which was a lovely touch and much appreciated. Only issue was the noisy aircon and my neighbours' plumbing - very noisy early in the morning. Will consider again when I need to be back in the area - if the price is right."
34,801,"Jan 26 2009 	Nice Surprise	I was ecstatic that my price for $75USD was accepted by Priceline for a Hilton hotel. I looked up tripadvisor to read about the hotel and the area, and read overall good things about it. I also looked up the rate of this hotel on the Hilton.com website and was astounded to see it going for 100 pounds a night; at the time I looked that was $150 USD! My stay did not disappoint since upon arrival I found a nice, hip area with lots of bars and restaurants and a nice hotel. The staff was very pleasant and efficient, a quick check in for me and I was off to my room. The room was of good size and the bathroom was spacious. The water pressure was good and the housekeeping did a great job at cleaning the room. I did not have breakfast at the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. I was a bit peeved that the internet was as expensive as it was (Like 15 pounds per day), but it is what it is. I just went to an internet cafe down the street for like 1 pound a hour; which was fine. I did get billed for eating at the restaurant when I did not ($45 USD); I found this out 2 days later while in Amsterdam as I was checking my online purchases billed to my credit card. I called and spoke to the manager in their billing department and he called me back a few minutes later and admitted there ahd been an error and that he has issued a credit adjustment. 3 days later it posted to my credit card account with no problems. Overall, I would defintely stay at this hotel again if I can get a priceline rate; for $75 USD it can't be beat!"
35,801,"Jan 19 2009 	Great hotel for the price	I've stayed at this hotel twice now. It's on the very trendy and central Upper Street in Islington and is surrounded by nice cafes and restaurants.The hotel is just a standard Hilton and to me that always says &quot;nothing special to look at&quot;. But the rooms are of a decent size and very modernly decorated. You get big lcd screen, a desk and seat and another seat. Plus the bed is very comfy. And it's only 2 minutes from Angel tube station.I got my latest deal for 60 for the night which included the cooked breakfast buffet. There is surely no other hotel deal in the UK as good value as that at the moment?)People have mentioned that this hotel is nothing special from the outside, hate the tacky vending machines, and were angry that they got a smoking room.I agree that if you get a smoking room when you've specifically requested in your notes that you don't want one then that's fine.But it's still 5 stars for me."
36,801,"Jan 19 2009	hilton islington	We had a fantastic stay at this hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived and even though we had paid an incredibly cheap rate for a london hotel we were allocated a brilliant room. The breakfast buffet offered a good choice and was well stocked and the cooked food freshly prepared. Our room was very clean and toiletries and tea, coffee etc replaced daily. We have stayed in dozens of hotels in london and this hotel was by far the best."
37,801,"Jan 17 2009 	OK chain hotel	This hotel is in a good location - a short walk from the Angel Islington almost opposite Islington Green, in an area full of bars, cafs and restaurants. This is a fairly smart and comfortable modern chain hotel. Large comfortable bed (actually two singles made up together), well-equipped and plenty of nice touches, bath as well as shower etc., very helpful staff, nice bar area. Less impressive are the feeble thermostatic blower heating (a basic electric heater was provided as well) and the level of noise (TV / voices / plumbing) from adjacent rooms. The shower hose leaked, and internet access is expensive (15). Overall this is a comfortable place to stay but it wouldn't rate it in my top five for similar-priced hotels in central London."
38,801,"Jan 13 2009 	Not a great experience	We got a room half price so were pleased with the price. Room was pleasant and clean, reception staff very friendly and helpful. We returned to room half through evening to find it smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke despite being a non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor. Called reception who told me as the hotel was fully booked they would send someone with some air freshener. A very snooty and on the verge of rude porter (despite being very nice to him) came to our room with foul smelling spray which was worse than the smoke. Night very quiet, despite being in 1 of a pair of adjoining rooms and bed comfortable with large flatscreen TV. Unfortunately breakfast was an absolute mess. Half the staff were again snooty, rude and unattentive. We had to queue to get into the restaurant for 15-20mins where we were given a glass of orange juice that had been sitting in the sun for far to long. We then decided to go straight for the cooked breakfast as everything apart from ham, cheese and cereal had run out and was not being noticed and replenished by staff. We then had to queue for another 15 mins for a cooked breakfast as the chefs were not able to cope and were not noticing the food getting low quick enough - I found this the most surprising element as I would think that a chef at the Hilton could multi-task effectively but apparently not. The chef at the front of house couldn't cope with asking for things in time, and cooked the eggs so quickly they were still raw - there were about 15 people waiting at this point. The waitresses, although I understand were busy, simply were unattentive and I got asked if I wanted tea or coffee near finishing my food. Eventually the sliced bread was replenished in the restaurant so I could have a piece of toast - there were no other items ie. the pastries, waffles and muffins there were supposed to be. I asked a waiter where the butter was and he could not understand the word 'butter', basic english for working the breakfast shift at a hotel I would have thought. It was the worst breakfast experience I have had at a hotel ever. The hotel is ok if you can get a good deal ie. not over 60 a night. The rooms were nice, reception staff very helpful but breakfast appalling - go at 7am or forget it."
39,801,"Jan 1 2009 	Great on discount rate	Given the very cheap rate we got through Hotwire (about 100 USD/night), this was a terrific bargain. Better beds than most English hotels, large room, widescreen TV, nice location in the lively Islington area and the general comfort that normally is associated with Hilton. On the negative side are the high prices for everything that is extra, the dull and unispired building (and bathroom) and the very un-romantic view from our first floor room (facing a garage).For snacks, water, sodas, etc, shop across the street at the tiny convenience store.The location is great for hanging out in Islington, but less fantastic for general London tourism given its distance to most sights."
40,801,"Dec 16 2008 	Very Enjoyable Experience	My husband, son and I stayed in the hotel from 5 December for two nights. On arrival we were able to leave our bags with the front desk until check in. I was unhappy with the first room we were allocated as it was on the ground floor and also smelt of smoke, so I asked for another room, the receptionist I dealt with could not have been more pleasant and gave me another room right away and also said to come back to her again if I wasn't satisified. Moving rooms also meant setting up another bed for my son, but by the time we reached the second room we were met by housekeeping delivering the bed. The rooms and bathrooms are spotless and the breakfast has something for everyone. We found the staff to be really friendly and approachable and on checking out we were again able to leave our luggage until we were leaving for the airport at 6pm. The location is perfect for travel to central London and is easily accessible by bus and tube. Would heartily recommend."
41,801,"Dec 11 2008 	Mixed feelings about this hotel....	I only stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, in preparation for a flight out of Heathrow after vacationing in Scotland. I checked in late, thanks to a delayed train (around 8:30pm) and was told that I was being given a &quot;smoking&quot; room. Apparently, this was the only room available and there was nothing that I could do about it. I booked this hotel via Hotwire with a great rate, and probably because of the rate I paid they decided to give me this crappy room. Now, this was my first time to the UK and maybe things work a little differently there than in the US, but in the US I would have been given a NON smoking room unless I specified otherwise. Maybe in the UK it is the opposite? I'm not sure. And Hotwire doesn't give you the opportunity to specify a choice anyways. But regardless, my room reeked HORRIBLY of smoke, and to make it worse, the windows are locked shut so you can't even air the room out! The smell was absolutely nauseating! However, I will say that the hotel was able to switch me to a different room the next day, which was much better. It was definitely an inconvenience, though, since I had to pack up my bags again so they could move them to another room. I really think that they should have been able to switch me to a new room the first night....I've stayed in many hotels and only complain when something is really bad, and in every other case I've been accommodated right away.The location of the hotel is pretty good as other reviewers noted, as the neighborhood does have plenty of dining &amp; shopping establishments, and the Angel tube station is nearby. And the price I paid was good for London, but after staying in a lovely family-run guesthouse in Edinburgh where we were treated very well, this place was quite the contrast. If a generic hotel with hundreds of rooms and sub-par customer service is what you are expecting, great. If not, I would suggest staying somewhere else."
42,801,"Dec 4 2008 	good option	Got a great deal on howire...less than 50.Very comfortable bed.Clean bright ,spacious room.Easy check in/out.In this part of town, what more do you want?"
43,801,"Dec 2 2008 	Not a fantastic choice	This Hilton Islington just about meets the grade.A few flaws though are evident though after staying here:* nondescript exterior, coupled by non-descript interior.* horrible, rock hard matresses* expensive internet access* tacky condom/snack vending machines opposite lifts on each floor that make the place feel like a pay-by-the-hour motel.Room was clean, staff were pleasant enough - but the whole place just lacks so much charm, soulless doesn't even do an accurate job of describing it. Would avoid, given a choice."
44,801,"Nov 12 2008	Good choice on a discounted rate	I'd really like to give this one 3 1/2 stars. There's really nothing exceptional about the hotel -- aesthetically, it's probably slightly below average for a Hilton -- but it's fine.The rooms are on the small side (I think they limit occupancy to 2 per room, and that's about right!), and everything is in reasonable condition. The breakfast buffet is good -- at least if you want a proper English breakfast, as the choices beyond that level are a little limited (good fresh squeezed OJ, though).As previous reviewers have noted, it's about a 4 to 5 minute walk to the Angel tube line which public transport pretty easy (the Northern line is not the BEST for tourists, but with connections it works fine). The neighbor hood seems &quot;real&quot; and &quot;yuppified&quot; with plenty of nearby restaurants -- you could easily dine at a different restaurant for days at any price level.The hotel seems to pop up frequently in the Islington section on priceline and hotwire, and it's a good property to bid on for 50 pounds or so. You'll be happy paying that price, but at regular non-opaque rates, my hunch is you could probably get better value elsewhere, unless Islington was your specific destination in London."
45,801,"Nov 8 2008 	just okay. nothing special	the hotel is about a 5 mins walk to the tube station and is on a good road for various restaurants and bars.the rooms were fine, big tv and comfy bed. quite basic - no extra touches. we didnt eat or drink here due the amount of choices nearby.the staff were okay but not that friendly. i asked for general directions to a nearby area and everyone i asked just told me to jump in a taxi then walked off.only really stayed here as i got a bargain on hotwire but i would probably give it a miss next time."
46,801,"Nov 2 2008 	Great Hotel	Loved the Hilton Islington. Stayed for two nights on a shopping break to London. Nice area, lots of nice restaurants and bars and some shops, gap, fcuk, m&amp;s etc. Short walk to Angel tube station. Got there early and our rooms were ready, we got ajoining rooms. Beds very comfy, very quiet at night, tea and coffee facilities in room. All the staff were very pleasant. Would stay at this Hilton again."
47,801,"Oct 31 2008	OK for short stay	I stayed here for one night on a work trip. The hotel was average at best. The bed was hard, the room looked a bit dated (although it did have a nice flat-screen TV). I would not have stayed here but for the fact it was the closest hotel to the office. I would not stay here again if I had a choice, as I have stayed in much nicer properties in London for the same price. But if it is close to where you need to be, it is an OK hotel for a short stay."
48,801,"Oct 28 2008	A good value for London	Hilton Islington London. 4* Rated.One Night weekday stay. Hilton HHonors Gold status.A Hotel review is based on a personal and subjective opinion.What may be acceptable to you, may not be to me, and vice versa. Location: Excellent - right on Upper St, and adjacent to Chapel St. Market and Islington. Angel Tube station (Northern Line) 4 mins walk.Area undergone gentrification, is now somewhat a destination for dining, and reflects authentic London pub/night life. Lots of great shopping and dining options in immediate area. Sainsbury's and Marks and Spencer food stores. Everything you may need within a few mins. Direct Bus and tube access to Theatre land / West end shopping 10 mins away.Safety: Very good 7/10. Although Big City common sense always applies. Check in: Easy and good natured. Staff mostly European.Property: Stakis property managed by Hilton, currently undergoing some upgrades and improvements.Lobby Restaurant area. Good WiFi - Food and coffee ok, not too overpriced for London. Room: Non smoking floor - No club room upgrade but not bad - Flat screen tv - Bed too hard.Internet: BT OpenZone Public areas (Prepaid coupons for sale at Concierge)Conclusion: A great location to base yourself for all tourist activities. Easy to get to, but far enough from the tourist centers to be a better value. Consistent budget quality in a city notorious for overpriced, sub standard accommodations.Stay again? YesUS rating: Solid 3.5 Star.Value: Good $$. 7/10"
49,801,"Oct 26 2008 	Great Hotel	This is a great hotel close to the Angel underground station and with a huge selection of restaurants and bars within walking distance.Despite having a full house when we were there we found the hotel to be very quiet and cosy, the staff are welcoming and helpful. The large rooms are clean and nicely furbished. A large buffet breakfast is seved in a bright room just off reception.In general this is a great hotel in a very central location."
50,801,"Oct 19 2008 	Excellent hotel in great neighborhood	I won a 3-night stay at the Hilton Islington on a Priceline bid of $80/night (about $98/night with taxes and fees included). I couldn't have been happier with my stay. I was already familiar with this part of Islington from previous visits, and was happy to stay in this diverse, untouristy neighborhood. Upper Street is full of bars, cafes and restaurants of all types - from pizza to Turkish to Indian. There are many lovely Georgian terraces and garden squares to explore, as well as the Regent's Canal and the charming antiques shops of Camden Passage. Excellent bus routes run to all parts of London from right outside the hotel, and the Angel tube station is also a very short walk away. I found it very easy to take the tube from Heathrow to King's Cross, and then the #73 bendy bus to the hotel.The hotel itself is modern and very well-kept. Front-desk service was gracious and helpful, and there never seemed to be a queue. My second floor room didn't have a view - it faced a pleasant interior courtyard - and was quiet and peaceful. The room's modern decor was somewhat bland, but everything was highly functional and in top condition; the room seemed to have been recently renovated, as the carpeting and furnishings all looked spic and span. There was ample closet and drawer space for my belongings. The bed had pristine white linens and was supremely comfortable. The A/C worked great, as did the large flat-panel TV. A business traveler would have felt comfortable here, as the lighting was great, electrical outlets were plentiful, and the desk was an excellent work space.The bathroom was large and just as spic and span as the bedroom. Outstanding water pressure and temperature, and plentiful towels and complimentary toiletries. I didn't try the hotel restaurant, as there are so many choices right outside the door. Breakfast wasn't included in my Priceline deal, but there are excellent options whether you want just a quick coffee or croissant, or a full cooked breakfast. Tinderbox Cafe has excellent espresso drinks and Ottolenghi, a Mediterranean deli/cafe/restaurant, is an outstanding choice any time, day or night.My stay at the Hilton Islington couldn't have been more pleasant, and I hope to win another Priceline deal at this hotel next time I come to London!"
51,801,"Oct 17 2008 	Standard Hotel - Very Good Location	My room at the Hilton Islington was quite large for London stnadards. Everything was in very good condition but decor and furnishings were drably contemporary. While I prefer modern design over more traditional decor, in case of the Hilton Islington it was just two standard and unimginative to leave an impression. Also I did not like that the windows could not be opened for some fresh air - which amazed me given that hotel only has four floors and I mostly found windows that cannot be opened in much higher hotels. The bed was OK but you can certainly find more comfortable ones in many hotels today.Service seemed very uninspired not to say impersonal. I can't say it was truly unfriendly but definitely also not outgoing and making you feel welcome. We did not have breakfast or dinner at the hotel since there are so many great places just around the corner. The location was our prime reason for chosing this hotel. If you want to be in a very nice neighbourhood which is actually more frequented by locals than tourists I would recommend Islington. It is not far from the West-End and Angel tube station is a mere 5 minutes walk from the hotel with many direct buses also connecting you directly to most areas in London stopping even closer. Restaurants, Bars and nice little shops are plenty in Islington and all within easy walking distance.I might return to the hotel - given that choices in the area are very limited and the Hilton having a prime location in Islington. The hotel itself would probably not draw me back there but then again it would also not keep me from coming back."
52,801,"Sep 23 2008 	Was upset about the service	I stayed at this hotel for three nights. I chose it because it was conveniently located in Islington close to Angel tube station and because the price seemed to be good.The hotel rooms are not small and they are clean, although I could smell smoke in my room. The rooms were not nicely decorated and particularly uncharming. The staff was absolutely unhelpful. When I arrived, I asked them to call a taxi for me. I waited for 45 mins. That was not their mistake. However, I had told them where I wanted to go before they ordered the cap and when I got on the cap I found out that my destination was only a 5 mins walk away from the hotel.The next day, I wanted to get something to drink at night. They told me that the bar was closed and that I had to get something from the machine on the 3rd floor. When I got to the machine, I found out that it only operated with credit cards plus PIN, which I don't have. I went back downstairs to the reception desk where they told me to go to the machine on the 2nd floor. That machine only had snacks, but nothing to drink. I ended up, going to bed thirsty and upset. The worst thing is that the staff did not seem to care at all, where they were sending me."
53,801,"Sep 21 2008	Great!!!	What can I say but the Islington Hilton is a great hotel !!!!We last stayed here in 2001 and sadly at that time we were not impressed with its faded decor, lack of motivated staff and bad breakfast standards....On this ocassion we returned as part of a large party booking and were a little worried about the standards this time round....BUT we need not have worried!!!!Service was flawless, staff were friendly, helpful and professional.Rooms were very well decorated, high standards, very clean, well stocked facilities and good range of electronics.Room service was 24hours, super fast and great value. and quality.Bar staff were excellent, very professional and friendly and the bar had an excellent range of draught beers.Breakfasts were superb!!!!!Breakfast staff were all up beat, happy and efficient which was great to experience each morning!!!!Buffet fruits, pastries, porridge, cheeses, cold meats, juices, smoothies, yoghurts, cereals..... Were a;ll very well presented, well chilled and very very clean. Staff were very attentive and pro active in keeping stock levels up, clearing tables and generally maintaining the area. Flawless!! An excellent buffet cooked breakfast was provided by the Chef who was friendly, professional and efficient. We thought he seemed very proud of his role too as he was a friendly person and was happy to cook guests fried eggs to order. We observed all cooked breakfast meats being probed for temperature by the chef and we saw consistent high standards on all 3 mornings we ate breakfast.Reception and concierge were all extremely friendly and professional.... cannot fault them!!!!Room service were excellent and friendly and did not enter the room when do not disturb was requested. A card was left asking if room cleaning was required later in the day, and if so to let them know the best time for them to return!! A great consideration!!!!The only negative thing I CAN say about the Islington Hilton is that they didnt have any decent shoeshine facilities ..... apart from a small cloth supplied in the room.... BUT the concierge were very quick to offer advice on a local store about 10 metres away where we could get some from! Overnight prior to our departure the hotel bill was pre- supplied for review, with the option of an express checkout slip and envelope if we wanted to leave fast.We checked out with the reception who offered to arrange a taxi to the Train station, which we took advantage of. A quality silver mercedes private hire taxi arrived within 5 minutes and the driver who was very friendly and helpful took us to the station in quick time and the fare was only 3 more than the price of the tube!!! Overall... a fantastic hotel!!!!"
54,801,"Sep 16 2008	Great location average hotel	This hotel has a great location in one of the best areas in London. Islington is bustling with lots of bars, restaurant and small shops. The hotel is a few minutes walk from Angel tube and easy to find. The rooms are above average size for London with well kept with nice bathrooms. The hotel is more modern than a lot of hotels in London but does not have a good range of facilities and an extremely samll restrauiant and bar area. The rates are good if you are lucky enough to get a deal. I stay here as it is the best hotel in Islington and convenient,"
55,801,"Sep 1 2008 	Great value	I stayed in the Hilton Islington for one night in mid-August 2008. By London standards the room is perfectly fine and, for the price, as good as you could expect: neutral decor and spotlessly clean with LCD TV. The bathroom is fine and has crabtree &amp;evelyn toiletries. Service was very good; the staff polite and courteous. Gave me my HHonours points even though it was booked on priceline.The location is great - heaps of restaurants and cafes nearby, and a cinema in the N1 centre. Buses 19, 38, 30 will take you straight into the west end. Islington station is only a few minutes walk away. I didn't eat in the Hilton - considering what's around the hotel there is no need to.If you're bidding on Priceline this is the only 4* hotel in the islington/finsbury region. I got my room for 60 per night (the cheapest online price was over 100/n). For that price, it is incredible value."
56,801,"Sep 1 2008 	Avoid this hotel.... It is cheap for a reason!	Please be careful, when you book on Hilton.co.uk, or check through any other travel website. Hilton UK send prices without taxes/VAT through. What seemed like a bargain 106, turned into 130!We arrived at the hotel at midday, and were checked in by the most unhelpful member of staff ever. He looked like he had been on shift way too long, was really discourteous, and started questioning the room I had booked. As the first person, you see at a Hilton, you should expect to be welcomed to the hotel. We had previously booked via the Hilton website, and requested a non smoking double room. I ended up being given a disabled persons room in the smoking section. I do have to admit though the room was very clean. I would have complained, but due to dogdy trains, I would have been late for a wedding. Our room was Bed and Breakfast, we went down for Breakfast around 9.30am, and the Host sat us down at a dirty table, which was cleaned whilst we sat at the table. We had to wait for cutlery and crockery, which I was not happy about. To top it all off, we requested a late check out, so we could hit the stores on Oxford Street before going home, we were told it was not available. I was a little concerned..... surely they knew about our request at check in....I was very disappointed."
57,801,"Aug 30 2008 	Nice Hotel right by tube stop	Very nice hotel right by a subway stop. A bit out of town, but with the London subway systems, who cares? We got a good rate via Hilton.Staff was able to get us tickets to Wicked, 8 rows back in the center. That is a great show by the way. Everything else was flawless, very nice stay."
58,801,"Aug 17 2008	Efficient and convenient	Very clean with an efficient check-in/check-out and helpful staff. Room had all the facilities you'd expect, with brand-name toiletries, well-laundered towels, a really nice bathroom, widescreen LCD TV with extra channels, etc. The only thing that stops me rating as a 5 is that the extras such as internet, breakfast etc. are very expensive (prohibitively so IMHO). I booked through Priceline and the price was good for London fo this quality, but didn't include breakfast. I'd recommend eating at one of the local cafes/bakeries. Location is fine, and very convenient for where I needed to get to - just a few stops on the Northern Line (nearest tube is Angel which is around a 10 minute walk)."
59,801,Aug 3 2008 	Ideal Location	Great location and usual superb Hilton breakfast.Staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and of a good size.Ideal if you are going to Saddlers Wells as we were or the Business Design Centre. Fredericks restaurant in Camden Passage is a must.
60,801,"Jul 15 2008 	Fantastic service and the most attentive staff!	We recently stayed at the Hilton in Islington and must say that we were really impressed by the hotel generally.Firstly, the location is very good - not in central London but easier enough to get around as it is so close to Angel tube station.The room was spotlessly clean and spacious considering there were two adults and one child - one double bed and a single.The window was locked so could not be opened, which we would have liked as it was a warm weekend, but the air conditioning worked very well - however, would still have been nice to have got some fresh air in the room. Tea and coffee making facilities but no mini bar or fridge - again would have been nice.The only negative thing about our stay was the breakfast. We have stayed in numerous Hilton hotels and have always been very impressed with the 'Hilton Breakfast' - this one was disappointing. The selection was very limited and not fully stocked, the worst being the hot selection which consisted of baked beans, mushrooms, very pale undercooked potatoes, scrambled eggs, again very pale insipid looking greasy fried eggs, the worst sausages I have ever tasted (again very pale, undercooked with an overpowering herb ingredient) and bacon which was pale undercooked and very fatty - difficult to serve as all stuck together in a clump. The items looked as though they have been 'boiled' and could have done with a proper grilling to make them look browner and more appetising.The best thing about our stay were the staff - ALL of the staff without exception were polite, obliging, smiling and couldn't do enough for you - special mention for the housekeeper who did an excellent job with a smiley, cheerful attitude.Overall we were very pleased and would certainly return."
61,801,"Jul 15 2008 	Great London Hilton	I've stayed at many of the Hiltons in London and I have to say that this is one of the best. I was upgraded to a suite which was large and comfortable. Everything was very clean and overall the room was excellent, faced into the courtyard area so there was no traffic noise.As has been said before it's a great location for pubs and restaurants and very convenient for Central London.Breakfast was buffet style. Huge selection and everything freshly cooked."
62,801,"Jul 7 2008 	Much more than I expected! Loved it!	Our trip to the UK had us in London twice. We stayed here after we had stayed at another London Hilton and we did not expect the LARGE room and the great service. The front desk remembered us after our check in; the concierge was extremely helpful in finding a small pub that had been recommended; the buffet breakfast included in our rate was extensive but the large room blew us away. I mean, this is London! We also enjoyed the area very much. Just step outside the hotel and you are in the midst of a vibrant street scene: outdoor cafes, open air markets and a few short blocks from the tube (Angel station- last stop in zone 1) and the N1 'mall'. We found our new home away from home in London."
63,801,"Jun 19 2008 	Functional and convenient	I should say I'm not a fan of personality-free corporate hotel chains. That said, I booked this through lastminute.com's 'Secret Hotels' (&quot;4* in Islington&quot;) because I needed somewhere in that part of town and didn't want any hassle. The hotel did its job perfectly - no hassle, quick service, friendly staff. The room was a good size, with a comfy bed. As with other chains like this, extras were VERY expensive, but I didn't bother with them - I'm amazed people still put up with hotels charging for WiFi access. So, in summary, a good location, a trouble-free stay, very comfortable, and good value if you get a deal - but beware the extra costs if you want breakfast or internet access. (For breakfast, head across the street to the S&amp;M cafe on Essex Road - excellent sausages!)"
64,801,"Jun 16 2008 	Fantastic hotel with great location!	We booked this hotel through lastminute.com and got it for 157 for 2 nights as a top secret hotel and was really pleased when we saw it was a hilton. We'd never stayed at a Hilton before so wasnt sure what to expect but it was brilliant. The front desk lady was really nice and booked us into our rooms no problem. We had two rooms in our party but we had booked sepreatly but she made sure we had rooms next to each other with no fuss at all. The rooms were a really good size for London and there was loads of room so you didnt feel cramped. The big plazma screen was fantasic and the beds were really comfortable and large! Tea and Coffee stuff was nice and even got herbal teas which is a nice touch. The bathroom was large and there was Crabtree and Evelyn toiletres which were replaced every day we were there which is unusal but great! The units in the room and bathroom looks dated in the photos but its not in real life and is really smart.The location was fantastic its a 5 min walk max on a straight road from Angel tube station (which is 1 stop from kings cross, it is really quick to get into central london) and was really easy to find. islington is like a mini town and has a Boots, Sainsburys, Monsoon, Waterstones etc all about 3 mins walk away. There are some really nice pubs and restaurants 2 mins walk from hotel, Cafe Uno is really nice! We didnt need to go into the centre of London at night cause there was so much to do so close to the hotel.Overall the hotel and the location were fantastic and I would stay there again."
65,801,"Jun 15 2008 	Wonderful stay!	Stayed here since I was attending a concert in London that evening; booked through lastminute.com and got a decent rate too. Very accessible to both public transport and the local amenities such as restaurants, which meant I didn't have to pay through the nose for room service. Very comfy bed, nice big room and Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries - what more could you want? If I got the same great deal on another occasion, I would have no hesitation in staying here again!"
66,801,"Jun 1 2008 	Great hotel - just one flaw...	Excellent location, 5 minute walk from the tube and buses, 20 minutes into the city. Lovely hotel, nice decor and excellent staff. Most uncomfortable bed we've ever slept in though which results in a lower rating than it could have achieved."
67,801,"May 27 2008 	Decent Hilton in area with few hotels	This is not the easiest part of London in which to find a hotel, let alone a good price for one. However, this Hilton is above the usual UK Hilton standard, and so merits its price tag. The location is great for Islington, and within walking distance (at a stretch, and not with heavy bags) of Kings Cross St Pancras. Clean and comfortable, with friendly staff - would stay again."
68,801,"May 21 2008 	Great hotel	Great hotel not as good as the Hilton can be, be still a great hotel in a good location."
69,801,"Apr 29 2008 	Great Location Comfy Room	We stayed at the Hilton for three nights during a quick visit to London. I was a bit apprehensive about the location because I won this hotel on Priceline for $90 per night, but we were pleasantly pleased with the location and the room. The hotel is a five minute walk from Angel station, which is convenient to most of London (one stop from King's Cross/Pancras, which is a larger station.)Our room, #233, was a non-smoking room with a very comfortable bed and well-appointed bathroom. Very quiet and enjoyable. The window overlooked a courtyard but we weren't there to spend time at the hotel. Like most major chains, breakfast is not included. Sadly, the hotel did not have a gym and to use a nearby facility (down Essex Street, a three-minute walk) incurred a charge, even though they gave Hilton guests a 5 pound reduction.The location is actually superb....there is everything you need in the area from a Marks &amp; Spencer to great restaurants to even a Borders and Starbucks. In a little outdoor mall area there is even a Sushi Yo! and a Wagamama, which is an amazing restaurant with great food.The one thing we found troubling was that to use the phone in the room would require a 2-pound connection charge each time we dialed out, including toll-free numbers. For some reason, we could not access the toll-free number from the phones in the lobby but one of the managers was kind enough to allow us to use the concierge's line. What a lifesaver as we were desperate to let family back home know we arrived safely. When we asked a receptionist (Amy) for permission to use the concierge line before our departure, she sadly would not give us permission to do so. Fortunately, we found a famous red phone book on the main street and were able to call home.We were certainly stay here again. The housekeeping staff was very helpful and accommodating."
70,801,"Apr 26 2008	Aside from a broken toilet a good stay	This review is based on a four-night business stay. My rate included the breakfast, which was very good and worth the price.Considering this is London, the room was relatively large. I think my room may have been bigger than average because I was in a corner of the hallway. If memory serves me right, this was called a &quot;Club Room.&quot; I'd advise asking for one when you book, since this gives you a more comfortable feel. The room amenities were fine, although Internet access was rather expensive.The one problem with my room was that the toilet would not flush at all. I reported it broken the first day. On the second day, I could tell it had been repaired, however, it still had trouble flushing consistently. I eventually figured out how to work it, but it was a pain.As for location, this is a nice area with tons of eating options. There are plenty of Indian, Thai and Italian restaurants within a very short walk. You are also close to the tube &quot;Angel&quot; station, which I'd advise for a faster, cheaper trip to/from Heathrow.Also, keep in mind there is no fitness room with this hotel. They will send you to another location at an extra charge.But aside from the broken toilet, this was a great stay."
71,801,"Apr 8 2008 	Nice Hotel - good location	Just back from a weekend in London. Stayed at the Hilton Islington for two nights. Got a great rate with Londontown.com. Hotel is in a great location. Around 3 minutes walk to Angel tube station (even tho it was closed last weekend for maintenance) and Kings Cross station.Located right on the main st with loads of restaurants and bars in the immediate facinity.The rooms were nice, newly refurbished. The bathrooms were ok. Just what you want when your not spending alot of time in the room.Overall i would recommend this hotel as a good base. Staff were extreamly helpful and friendly.Not a four star standard, but for the rate i got and its location it was a great deal."
72,801,"Apr 4 2008 	One Of The Best	This was one of the best hotels I have stayed in! Travelled to London to see Arsenal play newcastle and stayed on the 29th Jan 08. Not one problem with the hotel as it was clean, had very helpful staff, breakfast was good and the fact they let me try full halfs of lager before i purchased full pints. Room was very modern LCD tv's lovely furniture etc... I would definatly recommend this hotel to eveyone from tourists to corperate personnel. Some very nice places to eat nearby. exit the hotel access road to the left and try the Masala Zone (obviously indian grub) it had a great selection on the menu and all the meals myself and friends had were very tasty indeed.Hope this changes people's opinion of this hotel.P.s Arsenal won which was a bonus!!!"
73,801,"Mar 25 2008 	Great Hotel	Booked the room at hilton.com Got a good rate which included 1 breakfast and 1 dinner. The room size was good, which included a flat screen tv, desk, chair. The bed could have been more comfortable but it did the job. We requested foam pillows and they were there when we arrived. The room also included a bottle of still and sparkling water. Not sure if this is free for everyone of b/c we are hilton honor memebers. They also left shortbread cookies each day. The bathroom was a very nice size with nice toiletries. We were on the 3rd floor with a nice view of the street. The staff was excellent. We missed the breakfast b/c we missed our wake up call and the manager sent up coffee, juice and pastries. Overall we would stay here again without a doubt as long as we got a good deal. This hotel was expensive but worth it."
74,801,"Feb 25 2008 	OK but not the best	My husband and I stayed here for locality to Fifteen restaurant for birthday surprise.The good first:Great shower,seperate controllable power and temperature. Big shower enclosure.Crabtree &amp; Evelyn comp products. 2 double beds (more like large singles),clean white linens and duvets.Large flat screen tv,tea/coffee etc + kettle.Digital alarm clock.Wired internet in room 15 inclu vat for 24hrs. Wireless internet in lobby (buy vouchers in reception..Now the bad:He had booked a smoking room and this was very obvious when entering the room,it absolutly stank of old cigarette smoke,cant quite understand this as have stayed in many smoking rooms and no smell noticable to me and i am a smoker! This was made worse by the fact that the window didn't open!The view from the window was of a rubbish strewn alley and back of houses.My husband had breakfast and he said:Clean,tidy, efficient service.Buffet breakfast, tea,coffee,table service.Good variety of foods and all fresh cooked.Yoghurts,fruit,selection of breads,cheeses,cereals and full english as well."
75,801,"Feb 15 2008 	Quick trip to London	My fiance surprised me with a birthday trip to London. We found the hotel to very nice overall. It is right in the heart of Islington, just a 5 minute walk from Angel tube station. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but accross the road there is a nice funky cafe with serve great breakfast. The are lots of bars and restaurants nearby the hotel also. The room was modern and very clean."
76,801,"Feb 8 2008 	Good value base	This hotel is well located for both the financial district and other central London areas as it is close to the Angel tube station that is just a few minutes walk away.The hotel itself is clean and comfortable and my bedroom was a good size, although the furnishings were nothing special. The room could benefit from a more comfortable easy chair but as my stay was only one night this wasn't an issue. There was some noise from water pipes which disturbed my sleep; perhaps I was just unlucky with my room. Service was quick and efficient but nothing more.There are seemingly endless restaurants and bars in the locality, all within walking distance. There's also a shopping centre between the hotel and the Angel station.All in all this was a good value stay for the rate paid given the prices of similar hotels in London."
77,801,"Jan 23 2008 	Clean Hotel in City Location	Clean room, fairly spacious for a short stay. Flat screen tv with limited choice of channels. Comfortable bed with white linen. tea/coffee facilities in room along with iron and ironing board. On the negative side the towels were thin, the loo roll was single ply as was the insulation between rooms! Bedroom window did not open and the room had an unpleasant odour. Shower was a disgrace, with a dribble of water and did not give a refreshing start to the day. No traffic noise, close to Angel for the London Underground and bus routes into the city. At 135 room only I won't be rushing back."
78,801,"Jan 15 2008 	Great location nice staff lovely hotel	The Hilton London Islington Hotel is located in an excellent location. Hotel is a short walk from the Angel Tube Station on the Northern Line. There are numerous nice bars, restaurants and cafes on the same street as the hotel. Hotel has a nice restaurant and small bar. Staff are lovely and room was more than adequate."
79,801,Dec 31 2007 	OK hotel but extras very expensive	Stayed overnight Saturday to Sunday. Check in was easy and rooms were fine for 1 night although the lighting was very poor and very little light from windows. Bathroom speaker from the radio didn't work and curtains wouldn't close. We were offered buffet breakfast at 17 not including coffee/tea which seems a lot for a self-service offering so we passed. There's car park under the hotel and while I don't blame the Hilton for the charges (it doesn't belong to them) we felt that 42.20 for not much more than overnight was well over the top.I'd go back there if we got the great rate through Hotwire but next time we won't bring the car!
80,801,"Dec 27 2007	Nice Hotel Good neighborhood	This is a great hotel. Very comfortable bed. Nice, clean room. Staff was helpful with info on how to get around by tube. The restaurant has good coffee. Felt like a 5 star. The hotel is located a couple of blocks from the Angel tube stop on the Northern line. Easy walk from the station. It is located in a good area with a mall, small shops and a Union Burger (good burgers) right across the street. I would stay here again for sure."
81,801,"Dec 21 2007 	Great location for London stay	We stayed at the Hilton Islington for 10 days prior to a cruise. The location is an easy 5-7 minute walk to the Angel Tube station and a 3-5 minute walk to the major bus stops. The hotel rooms are the largest rooms we have ever stayed in while visiting the UK. The bath room was very modern and had a speaker from the tv as well. The room included an ironing board and hair dryer. The rooms have internet access, but we did not take a laptop so had to rely on the computer downstairs at 3 pounds for 15 minutes. We got a great rate on hotwire and would certainly recommend this location to those who don't &quot;need&quot; to stay in the heart of London. This is just 1.5 miles from St. Paul's Cathedral/the City area. We connected for most underground lines at King's X/St. Pancras or Euston. Getting around from here was very convient and easy. For those traveling through Heathrow, there is a ground level access/elevator 1 tube stop up (about 10-12 pounds via taxi) for the Picadilly line. This makes for easy and cheap transport to Heathrow.Tons of good places to eat, just a few steps outside the hotel. We certainly would stay again. For $99 US a night we felt like we had a great find."
82,801,"Dec 20 2007 	Comfortable hotel	I stayed at the Hilton London Islington for work. Nice location, surrounded by great restaurants and pubs. The rooms are large - pretty comfortable. Internet not included and pretty expensive approx. $30 for a 24-hr period. Not convenient if you are here for business. Staff friendly enough. Overall a good hotel."
83,801,"Dec 1 2007	good location	I'm in the hotel right now. good hotel in a good location for local bars etc, but the standards were not great- if I had got a better deal I would have been happier"
84,801,"Nov 5 2007 	Could not fault this hotel	We stayed at the Hilton Islington after booking it via LastMinute.com through their Top Secret Hotels deal. A total bargain at 63 p.n for a double room.Although before checkout you don't know the name of the hotel, it's easy to figure it out from the reviews :)Anyway, the hotel was lovely and i honestly could not fault one thing about it.Just a couple of minutes walk from Angel Tube station and there are loads of really nice restaurants and pubs on Upper Street (just across the road from the hotel)The room was a really good size and had all of the necessary amenities (including a flat screen tv, iron/ironing board etc) Lovely big bed and it was comfy too !!We didn't bother with breakfast as at 17.50 p.p it was a bit too much. We'd stay at the Hilton again without a doubt."
85,801,"Oct 30 2007 	No way is this 4 star.	This is not a 4 star hotel - It has no amenties such as pool, gym &amp; minibar (or fridge) - the only vending machine that worked was on a different floor &amp; charged minibar prices (without the convenience. While the room was large, comfortable &amp; clean, it is lacking in some areas. The beds are very springy. There isn't a powerpoint to plug your laptop etc at the desk without climbing under the desk. I asked for an extension cord, but they didn't have one. The clock is nowhere near the bed, so the snooze function is next to useless. The water pressure in the shower was very low.Prices charged for communications are astronomical. GBP 15 for 24hrs of internet. I only needed short periods to check email. Phone calls to Australia are GBP 8 per minute. Hilton is gouging with these prices esp. given the level of quality. Luckily this time I had an office to go to. Hilton should realise that people just don't use these facilities at all and go elsewhere. It leaves a very bad taste in your mouth.The staff were friendly enough, just not very helpful.The location is fantastic. Five minutes from Angel. The restaurants and pubs are lively and inexpensive. I ate at Le Mercury and dinner (Crayfish Ravioli, Chicken with Lentils, a cocktail and a glass of wine) came to less than GBP 20.00. The food was great. There is also a Sainsbury, unfortunately, there is no fridge in the room to put anything.I got a good buy on Priceline (USD 87.00 per night) but overall came away feeling that people only stay there when they can get a room at a high discount. Again it is not a 4 star hotel - lucky to be a 3, given the lack of amenities."
86,801,"Oct 1 2007 	Excellent value and rooms great location	A true priceline bargain at 45 for a one-night stay - one of the best four-star deals I've ever had.Location: at the Angel end of Upper Street (a few minutes' walk from the Tube), near the Business Design Centre. Upper Street gets a bit posher as it heads North but there are endless restaurants, pubs etc. as you head up there or Essex Road.Decor: nice subdued lobby, modern and unobtrusive decor in the room, but the corridors had unbelievable shrieking orange carpet and exposed brick, very seventies and clashing with the low-key elegance of the rooms.Rooms: Big, comfortable, good bed, LCD television (with a rather paltry selection of channels, but including some European ones). Tea and coffee making facilities, no mini-bar. Good-sized bathroom with above-average shower. Excellent standard of cleanliness. Ice machine on each floor (and vending machine for 'essentials' but this was empty).Didn't try the hotel bar or restaurant, both certainly looked at least adequate.A bit of a characterless hotel, certainly comfortable enough, a businessy rather than a touristy atmosphere, but extremely convenient for most areas of interest in London (5 minutes by Tube from King's Cross) and in a vibrant area. Recommended."
87,801,"Sep 30 2007 	Good stay at convenient location	Great Location, helpful staff. Got a great deal on Hotwire!Internet not included, but that is standard in Europe. Only a few blocks from the tube. Very safe. Nice room, updated hotel, very modern."
88,801,"Sep 16 2007 	Loved the area	Booked a late deal and proved excellent value for money. The room was spacious and very clean. Islington is a great area with lots of bars, cafes and restaurants to choose from and reasonably priced. Recommended."
89,801,"Sep 9 2007 	My new fav hotel in London	Stayed at Hilton Islington Aug 23rd and 24thTook the first capital connect from gatwick to kingscross and a cab to the hotel.Hilton Islington is tucked away in the corner from a street full of shops, boutiques, bars really a great areaTheres a wine/liquor store on the corner and Sainsbury grocery store and a starbucks all less than 5 minutes walk from the hotelThe hotel room was small but adequate and clean, plasma TV, no tub standup shower, low pressure water in sink but shower was great. Dont use the ice machine there was SLIME, anyone from Houston Texas knows Marvin Zindler God rest his soul we learn to investigate the ice machine lol. The staff was very friendly however they didnt give me my Hilton honors points because I booked via hotwire.All in all i loved this hotel, clean comfortable great price awesome location."
90,801,"Sep 5 2007 	Overall a great stay	We booked this hotel on Hotwire, and for less than $100 USD a night, were very, very pleased with what we got. The hotel is a 3-5 minute walk from the Angel tube station, surrounded by places to eat, shops, and grocery stores. The room was spacious and clean.There was one unpleasant incident with the hot water not working our first morning there--the hotel had it fixed within the day, and we did receive an apology note. We also had one unpleasant run in with a member of the housekeeping staff, who didn't appreciate that on our one day to sleep in on our vacation we actually had slept in (we left the hotel at about 10:30, as opposed to 8:30), and subsequently interrupted her cleaning schedule. After huffing her displeasure and asking when she might come back to clean the room, she never bothered. But we didn't consider that reflective of the hotel, just of that one particular staff member.The front desk staff were helpful and polite. Again, for the price we paid for this hotel, we have no complaints whatsoever. It was a very nice stay."
91,801,"Aug 25 2007 	Very Nice	Was here from 21 - 23 August 2007. Well treated and given a free upgrade with breakfast !! Enjoyed the local area and as previously stated not too far from central London by Tube.Staff very pleasant and rooms clean and tidy with new flatscreen TV's. Like to move about however, this is a nice hotel and I can recommend it as long as you do not want to be in central London."
92,801,"Aug 22 2007 	Great rooms and location - service well intentioned but not fine tuned	This hotel is above average by London standards. The rooms are really nice and the hotel is clean. For the price, it's a great deal - the location is not in central London but close enough. The tube stop is right around the corner and the neighborhood itself is very cute with shops, restaurants and pubs. I felt safe in the neighborhood. The hotel staff is well intentioned but I couldn't help but feel that the service isn't what you expect at Hilton. My wake up call did not come the first day, on the second day it came 30 minutes EARLY.. by day three I finally got the right wake up call. Be careful because the &quot;24 hour&quot; internet billing tries to charge you every 8-12 hours - I notified the front desk and they corrected it. At breakfast, I wasn't served coffee until after my meal for the first two days, when i finally said something, the staff over-corrected themselves and practically stood over me while I ate to make sure that I had everything... it was a little annoying (but well intentioned) Also - don't ask the concierge staff to call you a taxi - get your own on the curb - they call a private car service rather than taxis and they charge about 20% more than a London taxi (I tested this a couple of times)"
93,801,"Aug 19 2007 	Very nice good location	We stayed here in April 07 and have no complaints.The hotel is well located in a very nice area, and the tube station (Angel) is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Around the hotel is a good choice of bars, cafes and restaurants.Our room was quite spacious - larger than expected for Central London. The staff were very pleasant, and brunch in the bar/dining room was very nice and reasonably priced.The hallways on our bedroom level looked a little odd and somewhat dates - very swirly carpets and exposed bright yellow brick!Lovely hotel. I would stay there again."
94,801,"Aug 7 2007 	Good value attractive village-like location	I paid about 60 GBP/night through Hotwire and definitely got value for money. The hotel is a short walk from the Angel tube station (northern line). Islington is obviously up and coming, an emergent upmarket village atmosphere characterizes the bustling, multicultural neighbourhood with excellent food and shopping opportunities. The decor of the large room was pleasant, new, and tidy. The lack of an in-room safe is an unfortunate omission. The ridiculous phone charges (8 GBP for one minute to New Zealand) sent me to a nearby phone booth. Overall a greatly enjoyable stay, though."
95,801,"Aug 4 2007 	surprising!	We booked this over lastminute.com as one of their secret hotels!Had we known at the time of booking it was a hilton we wouldn't of gone - we had a very bad experience at the stanstead one.But having paid for it we went.It was pretty cool, our room was nice and big and very well decorated. The bathroom was nice and big and the room had nice touches like music in the bathroom and all that.The bed was really nice and comfy. The hotel is only two stops from Euston.I would go here again."
96,801,"Jul 19 2007 	One of the best Hiltons I've stayed at	I booked this Hilton after reading other reviews on this site and I have to say it's good reviews were well deserved. The location although not central London is awesome. Shops, a movie theater, restaurants and a tube stop (Angel) were all within 5 minutes walking distance. My room was quiet, comfortable, the air conditioning was actually cold (some hotels have it preset and it's hardly AC at all) and the shower pressure great. Staff was helpful and friendly. I've stayed at two other Hiltons in London and this was by far the best in terms of value for the money (not cheap by any means but a good value for a Hilton)."
97,801,"Jun 14 2007 	really nice	I have to say I would never have booked a room there if it hadn't been for the special deal I got. I'm not the richest person so I'm always looking for at least semi-cheap rates and am also very location-oriented.We got there a little early (11 am) and asked if we could still check in and the front desk checked to see if there's something available. We were offered a disabled room, which was fine with us; as described it had more room to move around. The room was clean too and it had a water boiler, tea bags and some cookies (I love this about hotels in England) which were filled up promptly the next day.The hotel is in a good location, only a 5 minute walk from the tube station. Generally this hotel is in a nice area with lots of shops, an arcade, plenty of choice regarding meals, there's a drugstore and supermarket within walking distance and some pubs too.The staff was friendly and we were especially glad about the hassle-free early check-in.We didn't eat there or check out any amenities.For the special rate I got I would definately go again next time I'm on vacation in London. I don't know about the usual rates."
98,801,"May 16 2007 	Good hotel great value!	We stayed at the Hilton Islington for a Friday night recently and got it for under 100 through Opodo, which I think is brilliant value for a good London hotel. The area is upmarket and full of life, with such a choice of bars and restaurants literally on the doorstep. We wanted to stay in this area as we were going to the Almeida restaurant, which I would recommend highly. We were upgraded to a King Deluxe Club room, which was very large and immaculately clean. The hotel is modern and comfortable and all staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. Lovely Crabtree &amp; Evelyn toiletries in the room and a fluffy robe too. Didn't have breakfast there due to poor reviews on this site. Instead we went to Camden Passage (right opposite the hotel) and found The Breakfast Club, which was extremely popular, had to wait 10 minutes for a table, but worth it. It does all kinds of different breakfasts, smoothies etc and the surroundings are really unusual. All in all, I would highly recommend this hotel if you can be slightly away from central London or if you do not want to have to take out a second mortgage to finance your stay!"
99,801,"May 12 2007 	Best Stay so far	I have stayed at this hotel many times in the past few years &amp; had some problems but this trip was very un-eventful, yes one of the better stays (three nights).Check in was excellent, the room (they upgraded me) was one of the best in the hotel &amp; the breakfast each day was very good.My wife &amp; I also eat in the restaurant one night &amp; again the food was fine. There are better restaurants in the area but it was raining &amp; we did not want to leave the hotel. I always try &amp; stay at this hotel due to its location my only complaint (nothing to do with the hotel) is the police &amp; other sirens at night. Looking forward to another stay on my next trip to London"
100,801,"Apr 23 2007 	Excellent hotel good location	Great location, excellent staff, good price.The hotel is 5 minute walk to the Angel tube station and from there you can easily access any major site in London. The hotel is less than an hour from Heathrow airport.There are also plenty of reasonably-priced restaurants nearby.We paid about $100 US from hotwire."
101,801,"Apr 14 2007 	Good for the price	I obtained a wonderful price for this hotel on Hotwire so for the price paid my overall experience was good. The hotel is very well situated: about three blocks from the Angel tube station and right off Upper Street which is lined with restaurants, pubs and even a Starbucks right across the tube station. You are just a couple of tube stations away from Covent Garden and most places in Central London. The hotel is in a fair condition although the furniture in the rooms looks a little old and the rooms are kind of small (which is standard for London). For a Hilton, and a four star hotel, I expected a little bit more in terms of service and amenities. The room did not have a safe box for example, nor a mini-bar. There are vending machines in every floor but none of them worked during the three nights I stayed there. But, there is a lttle store on the corner whre you can buy water, drinks, etc. if you need to."
102,801,"Apr 10 2007	Poor poor security	The hotel itself was of good standard and the food was also good. Our trip however was ruined by a theft in the lobby of the hotel which could have been easily avoided if the hotel paid a little more attention to security. Basically a scam artist (very dodgy looking) was able to waltz in and steal an expensive mobile phone from under our eyes, and make a run for it even when we were shouting 'THIEF!' because there was absolutely no staff in the hotel lobby present to challenge him, or stop him entering in the first place. For a four star hotel I thought this was appalling, and severely tainted our opinion of the Hilton chain. My main advise would be to be very vigilant in the lobby of this particular hotel."
103,801,"Apr 4 2007 	Great Place to Stay	For my first trip to London I booked my hotel through Priceline so was a little nervous about what I would get. Happily I had no reason to worry. The Islington Hilton was a wonderful place to stay. Only about a 5 min walk from the Angle tube station,it was easy to find. The staff were very helpful and seemed to be knowledgeable about the general area pointing me in the direction of the nearest post office when I wanted to mail some postcards. The room was very spacious and the bed was comfortable.I can not comment on the food as I did not eat at the hotel during my stay. But there are many good pubs and restaurants nearby along with a Boots and Tesco. A very nice neighborhood to stay in, and while not in the center of London it was a short tube ride away to the major attractions. While the Hilton's prices are out of my budget making it impossible for me to stay there normally next time I visit and use Priceline I will be hoping that I get this hotel again."
104,801,"Mar 29 2007	Below My Expection for a Hilton	I booked this property due to the price (best value) and the convinence to the tube station since I had an early connection to the Waterloo station the next morning. Arrived the hotel around 5PM due to the MAJOR baggage delay (Thanks British Airways, missing out whole tank of luggages without ANY single agent showing up). This is a short walk from the Angel Station, and the area is very nice, its good for first time solo travelers since they are easy to find. As a HH Gold member, i got turned down for the upgrade to the club rooms (I am sure they have plenty but they said no). But i got breakfast instead. The staffs are nice and helpful (well, some aren't that knowledgable for the local areas but oh well, its not hard to get around the area once you have a tube map). They also let people to borrow AC adaptors too!The room is big for UK size/European standard. Typical Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products but the mattress, as other members suggested - sucks! The bed is so springy..I mean seriously, when I sit on it I can hear the spring sound and I can actually COUNT on how many springs they have on my mattress.. What happened to the hilton sweet sleeper bed? The rooms appears to be clean BUT the soap dishes are green!! moldy!! nasty!!!I mean Its not that expensive to change a soap dishes right? The A/C in the room works like a charm, I really appreciated that. The breakfast wasn't THAT bad in my opinion. UK is not a country known for the delicious cusine. Even McDonalds taste worse in here than the states (in my opinion). However, the breakfast is decent enough to feed you if you just want to fill yourself up in the morning. In contrast to the previous revewer, the screamble eggs ARE NOT COLD. Its hot, the guy makes it infront of me, and he takes requests too - pretty nice (except that they don't make omelttes). Fresh Juices, fruits, yogurts, few meat selections available but I would not pay full price for this breakfast tho. THere are many pubs and restaurants within walking distance so you should try it out. Love the pubs next to the hotel, cheap place to chill for the night!"
105,801,"Mar 27 2007	Comfortable stay for convenience only	Got a good deal on this hotel on Lastminute.com fro 63 ( secret hotel but you can work it out generally). Needed a cheap stay in this area for a night for it was ideal for me for a bed for the night.When i checked in I was told i had been upgraded to a delux room, i was excited but when i got to the room I was brought bacj down to earth as it was very average and very small, still very clean and all i needed. Good value for the moneyI ordered room service as was too tired to leave the room, wish i had as there looked like a hughe choice or restaurants in teh immediate area. I ordered the risoto, it was 12 but after the 3.75 tray charge it was expensive- I only had a bit of it as it was so salty I couldnt eat it. Lucky I wasnt starving.Nice crabtree and Everlyn products.The room was cold, I put the heat up as much as I could but couldnt warm up, the covers were very thin and it was lucky i had two beds, i nicked the other duvet and had two. I woudl stay again if i coudl get the same rate and needed to be in the area but would not eat there!."
106,801,"Mar 6 2007	Could not recommend	When we arrived at 3.30 p.m. having travelled since 10.00 a.m. the hotel had no electricity so we could not check in. They said it was a fault on the grid - but all the surrounding premises appeared to have electricity. They stored our bags and said the problem would be fixed by 5 p.m. and then minutes later that was changed to 6 p.m. so we left and went to a pub just around the corner ( 2 mins walk) which had electricity. At 6 p.m. we returned &amp; checked in.We had booked for 3 people at 166.00 per night for B&amp;B and paid in advance.There were 3 cups in the room, 2 bottles of water, 2 bath towels and 1 bath robe! So we could all have tea together but would have to share towels?We went out and returned at 8.45 p.m. to freshen up before dinner. This time the hotel fire alarm was sounding, people were leaving and the fire brigade arrived 1 minute after us!  Positives:(1) Our room was clean, big and bright.(2) The staff were polite(3) The location is excellent - Angel tube about 5 mins walk(4) Lots of good pubs and restaurants in the vicinity.Negatives:(1) The breakfast is disgusting and at 16.00 an absolute rip-off. Horrible salty bacon, cold scrambled eggs, cold tea, and you have to make your own toast. I left this so called &quot;cooked breakfast&quot; on the table and went for fruit, ham, cheese and a roll. No selection of cheese - just slices of sweaty cheddar and poor quality ham. I cannot compliment any aspect of the two breakfasts I had to endure there - I so regretted having paid for the breakfast in advance.(2) Inadequate provision for the number of people in the room.(3) The heating system - it was cold but they don't have central heating - just a blow out air conditioning / heating unit which made a terrible racket. So wake up in a cold room, turn on the unit, go back to bed and get up 15 minutes later when the room is warm?(4) Our room key card failed twice and they tried to convince us we didn't know how to use it properly.(5) No mini-bar - it's supposed to be a 4 star(6) Finally to add insult to injury they tried to charge us again for our stay on checkout.The electrical problem may not have been their fault or the fire alarm going off but the rest of the problems could be fixed. Their staff have been trained to say Sir / Madam at will, but we wanted value for money, not just politeness."
107,801,"Feb 27 2007	Great Location	Great location. Spent a week there in February 2007. We found the angel location a short trip from anywhere in the city. THe neighborhood was intersting with great small pubs for quick meals. Staff was friendly and helpful. We had a family double, corner room. Very comfortable and large. On site restaurant a little pricy but very good food. Breakfast buffet a great deal if you get it with your room rate, lots of choice. Chapel Street marketplace a great diversion during the days. Bloomsbury, Russell Sq a short walk down ST John Street and RoseBury. Overall a nice place to stay would do it again without a second thought"
108,801,"Feb 25 2007 	Leaves a Bit to be Desired	Once you reach the hotel, which takes a while as it is hidden from view from the road, it has a fairly good location in relation to the tube, about 4 blocks. The rooms were decent and clean, there is air conditioning for summer, the staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable about the surrounding area, and there is a parking lot beneath the hotel.However...1. Parking is ~ $85 USD per day (after $5 hotel discount) which is not disclosed when booking2. The fitness center is 1/2 mile away, in a shady part of town, and does not allow anyone under 18 to use the equipment or pool (also not disclosed, as we had children wanting to swim in the &quot;indoor&quot; pool)3. The hotel breakfast buffet is ~ $32 USD per person and is limited in selection4. There are no self-laundry services inside the hotelYet if you don't bring a car, don't excercise or swim, don't eat at the hotel, and don't rely on the staff for information about London, this is a reasonably good hotel for you (if you can find it)."
109,801,"Feb 5 2007	Great Location Decent Hotel	I have stayed at the Hilton in Islington on 4 occassions over the years and find it to be a perfectly acceptable choice.It helps that I know the area, having lived there in the early 90s, but the hotel really does have a great location. You are 15 minutes from the heart of the West End by tube (25 minutes by bus), but should you wish for a different, less touristy experience, Upper Street has bars and restaurants to suit most tatstes and budgets.The value for money can vary enormously, and I have managed to get a deluxe room for 50 a night via Lastminute or 200 via the hotel. It certainly pays to shop around.On this visit I was upgraded to a suite, which made the 180.00 a night seem like good value, but beyond that the standard rooms are comfortable and quiet.All in all, this is a good hotel for those on business or vacation."
110,801,"Jan 4 2007 	Ok Only	For a 4 star hotel,our stay was very average.We chooze this hotel for practical reasons namely its location as its close to the emeirate stadiumn where we were going to see Arsenal play that night.For this reason it does well,but where it gets its 4 stars from i'll never Know perhaps because of its association with The Hilton tradename,it could be nothing else.The rooms wee bland and small no mini bar,and just basic in house services.The fire alarm went off at 11am the following morning for five minutes,fair enough they were doing a drill of which they had advised the night before but why not do it after check out time at 12 and an alarm ringing in you head for 5 minutes is not good.Twice housekeeping came to the door to do the room and then the porter came us to ask us if we were checking out and all before the check out time of 12,this was annoying and rude.For the price we had paid you would do far better in staying down the road in the jurys inn,islington where the service is better and the rooms cheaper.We wont be staying again!!!!!!."
111,801,"Jan 2 2007 	Weekend in London	Stayed here for a long weekend in November. Hotel was a nightmare to find as we missed the original turning and ended up on the dreaded one way streets but once we did get to the right road it was fine - won't make that mistake again!Check in was fab, staff very good and room was a pleasant surprise. Clean, comfortable and quiet. Islington was buzzing and it was nice to have a bite to eat in the nearby restaurants and bars. Hotel breakfast was fine - good choice and staff were good. Angel tube station is close by and getting into central London was easy. Would definitely stay there again"
112,801,"Dec 28 2006	An Excellent 4* Hotel	The Hilton London Islington is an excellent all-round hotel. Its location is good, just off Upper Street, next to the Business Design Centre. It is a short walk from ANGEL Underground station, on the Bank Branch of the Northern Line, and there are also plenty of buses.The check-in was reasonably straightforward. The lobby area is pleasant, bright and clean.The rooms are of extremely high standard, with a lot of space, and a nice seating area. There is mineral water, wine and chocolate in the room each day. The decor is modern and the facilities are functional. The beds are comfortable, and there is air-conditioning. The bathroom is spacious, with a nice sized bath, and there are Crabtree &amp; Evelyn toiletries upon each day.The restaurant is excellent, serving an outstanding buffet breakfast, which includes a hot selection, with freshly cooked eggs, waffles and pancakes. The dinner in the restaurant is also of excellent quality. A good variety of food can be found on the menu, and is bound to suit all tastes.I would recommend this hotel for any purpose, whether business or leisure, and for any length of stay."
113,801,"Dec 17 2006	Well recommended	Booked via Hotel Connexions, my stay here was most enjoyable, especially compared to some other London hotels, reputedly 4 star! The hotel is a few minutes from the Angel tube station, with easy access to London's attractions. It is also in a fascinating part of the city, with many antique and bric-a-brac establishments near by. The room was comfortable, modern and spacious (by London standards). Breakfast did get very busy on the Saturday morning, with people having to wait for available tables. However, there was printed advice about this in the lifts, and there was certainly no problem prior to 08:30.I definitely would stay here again."
114,801,"Dec 11 2006 	Excellent Hotel	Stayed for a weekend city break with my husband and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff were efficient and friendly and we were upograded to a de-luxe room FOC which was a bonus. Room was spacious, modern and clean with everything we needed. Breakfast was great with a wide choice and staff were helpful and efficient. Location was superb - two minutes walk from Angel tube and ideally located for mainline stations and getting around London. We felt safe walking from station to hotel early mormning and evening when there were fewer people around &amp; there were bars and restaurants on the main street although we didn't sample these. There is also a Sainsbury's &amp; M&amp;S located nearby the hotel which is handy. Would stay again - we really enjoyed our weekend break to see the sights &amp; shops - we also combined it with a visit to a Gordon Ramsay Resuarant - Boxwood Cafe which we can also thoroughly recommend."
115,801,"Dec 3 2006 	Solid choice good value great neighborhood	I used priceline to get a bargain in London and was given the Hilton in Islington for $100/night for 7 nights. I was a bit worried about the cookie cutter large chain thing and about being in North London (would it be too far away from places I wanted to visit?)Well, no worries. It's a fine hotel, good customer service (Ben the concierge was particularly nice) clean, good amenities, and in a great neighborhood. I loved Islington and Upper Street. Lots of cafes and shops, 5 minute walk to Angel tube, walkable to St. Paul's, and just a nice neighborhoody local and not touristy feel. I really felt like a Londoner in that neighborhood, unlike anytime I got near Piccadilly, where I felt I stood out like a sore thumb.The hotel itself is cookie cutter and what you'd expect, not up to American Hilton standards but par for the course for those in London. Completely acceptable, but not remarkable, and for $100/night on priceline, I'll take it anytime."
116,801,"Nov 22 2006 	Rude Reception	We stayed here for one night with our two kids in interconnecting rooms. It was clean and resonable and breakfast was fine. Not that atmospheric, but the location in the middle of Islington suited us as we were going to a party in the evening. When it came to checking out the next morning, there were some unidentified costs on the bill. It turned out our 6 year old son had been able to access pay per view material on the TV in his room. I asked what he had been able to watch and suggested that they should have put a parental lock on the TV as they knew two children would be sleeping in the room. The receptionist, whose name I remember was Akshit, was unbelieavably rude. He said they didn't list channels on the bill as it could include pornography. When I said that I was concerned that this had been available to my young children he said this wasn't his responsibility and was extremely rude and supercilious. So ok hotel - but beware of Akshit, he ruined my stay."
117,801,"Nov 21 2006 	Great Hotel excellent location	Stayed at hotel over weekend. Hotel is in an excellent location - Islington itself has everything you need from a social perspective for bars, restaurants, coffee shops etc. It is about a 6 cab ride from Kings X or only one stop on the tube.Hotel itself is very nice and modern with everything you need. Staff were excellent, very friendly, polite and professional.We got this deal for 89 per night bed and breakfast and one night dinner. Price wise it is on par with a central LondonTravel Lodges however is heads and shoulders above in terms of quality. Have to say that this hotel will be my new preferred choice when I stay in London from now on. Highly recommended!!!"
118,801,"Nov 20 2006 	Handy for the Emirates stadium	Nice clean hotel, had family room, 2 double beds and one double sofa bed. Room was fairly standard, but had lots of space. Hotel does not have any leisure facilities. Check in/out very fast and efficient. Staff were very attentive and customer focused. Breakfast is usual all-you-can-eat hot/cold food, cereals fruit, bread etc etcHotel is roughly 20mins walk to Arsenal ground, and sited close to a variety of pubs and eateries...and some nice shops too. Angel underground is right outside."
119,801,"Nov 20 2006	Great hotel excellent staff and location.	I stayed at the Hilton Islington with a friend and found the hotel to be far better than we expected. We booked a special offer whereby we got a free evening meal on the first night and full breakfast on both mornings. After arriving at the hotel late on the Friday evening, the very helpful desk staff changed our free meal to the next evening. We were not expecting them to be so accomodating.The rooms are great and very comfortable. The staff cannot be faulted and no request is too much for them.Best of all, this hotel has an excellent location, right by loads of gread restaurants and bars. Ideal for a weekend away and not much more expensive than a grotty travel lodge.Would definitely stay again."
120,801,"Nov 15 2006 	Great Value	Booked a Hilton weekend break directly through the website - great value at under 80 per room per night, including breakfast and one evening meal.Hotel fairly modern, room quite spacious and clean. Close to Angel underground station, so only a few stops to all major attractions. Islington itself on your doorstep with loads of restaurants, pubs, cinema etc.Hotel staff very friendly and helpful.If you are looking for a good mid range hotel close to the centre of London I would highly recommend."
121,801,"Oct 17 2006 	no problems here.	stayed here over the weekend, had a king non-smoking as requested. Staff was friendly and helpful (though I don't usually ask for much other than peace and quiet). Hotel was clean and no problems... it's a little bit away from the city center but an easy 5 minute walk to Angel tube station. Location is nice enough, all kinds of local shops in the area and seems very safe even late at night. Vending machines instead of minibar, which is fine with me.This hotel does not compete on luxury with many of the much nicer city-center hotels, but it's generally priced much lower and I think the value for your money here is generally good."
122,801,"Oct 9 2006 	Great Hotel	Stayed here for 2 nights, friday and saturday, 2 adults 6th and 7th October 2006. Found the hotel was brilliant. Everywhere was so clean and bright and nicely decorated. Had everything we wanted. Did not eat in the restaurant so cant comment on that as we were out and about sightseeing and eating, but did have breakfast in bed which was a real treat!! Ordered lots of things on the menu and was delivered promptly at 8.00 a.m as requested. Paid a good price for the stay through lastminute.com which included the breakfast. Will be staying here again without a doubt. Angel tube station 5 minutes down the road with all lines to all places easily accessible. The hotel is situated on the main street of Islington but you are not disturbed with any noise due to hotel being set back from the main road. Plenty of bars and restaurants in the vicinity. Only one complaint did not have a fridge in our room which would have been useful. Never mind!! Good helpful and polite staff. Would recommend."
123,801,"Sep 11 2006 	Excellent Hotel Excellent Location	We only stayed for one night but the hotel was great and the staff were helpful. We were allocated a disabled room even though neither of us were and the bathroom was huge! The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows in the wardrobe if you needed them. There was even a yoga mat if people wanted to exercise.The free breakfast was superb, with a choice of hot or cold food. The hotel is about a 10 min walk from Angel tube station and is on the Northern Line.I would definitely stay here again."
124,801,"Aug 28 2006	Trendy location	I have recently spent three nights at this Hotel with my family including my wife and three childrens aged 12, 4 , 1 booking two connecting rooms. Although I am Hilton Diamond Member they did not upgrade me to a better room due to the fact that they only have connecting doors on standard rooms. However I found the same slightly cosy but well refurbished.Reception and overall assistance on average with some good exception. I had dinner twice at the Mosaic Restaurant and in general food was acceptable but not exciting even considering the price. Also breakfast was good but due to the tight space provided you can suffer some queue with waiting time. I would rather recommend to spend time to eat elsewhere considering that the hotel is located in one of the best trendy place in London where you can taste how londoners live.But also centre of London such as Piccadilly, Regent Street and so on easibly to reach with bus and tube.In general we were satisfied of our stay and could choose once more to stay here in future."
125,801,"Jul 17 2006	Positive staff good location	Stayed five nights at this hotell first week of July during a heat wave in London. First night was a challenge because the air condition broke down, but we were given a new room next day without any problems, and the staff moved all our suitcases while we were out in London. We were two adult, one teen and one child and we were given a large family room (Hilton Club room with an extra bed). The room was clean, bath room spotless and the teen really enjoyed the big towels and the dressing gown. The staff was most helpful both with room, luggage and information for travelling around London. The hotel is located close to a busy street with many bus lines right out side the hotel and a 3 min walk from Angel tube station ideal for getting around London (take bus line 274 from Hyde park up past Regent park and through camden to Islington as a sight seeing). Although this central location, we did not experience any traffic noice because the hotel is not on the main street itself. We had breakfast in the hotel every morning and there was plenty of it. The kids were offered pancakes without asking. You can also have breakfast at one of the many small cafes and resturants immediately outside the hotel if you prefere. We had all our evening dinners outside the hotel in one of the many resturants just around the corner and enjoyed eating from a different culture cuisine every night. Apart from the air condition break down the first night, we had a very pleasant stay and we will use this hotel again for future visits to London because of its quiet location, nice staff, cleanliness and with many resturants nearby."
126,801,"Jun 28 2006	Centrally located and pleasant stay!	Stayed for 1 night on 20 June, just 10 mins walk from Angel tube station. Convenient location with lots of resturant and bars around.Check in is ok. Ask for a free upgrade because of the HHonors Gold VIP, given a Non-smoking Club room on level 1. No free breakfast, asked but said that one can only enjoy one offer at a time (1 week after the saty, received an apology from Manger about this error and promise to rectify this next time).Room is clean and spacious. Bathroom amenities just ok. Boiler, Tea, Wine complimentary. No noise at night (facing the courtyard). No swimming pool but free access to a Health Club nearby.Staff (Ben) very friendly and helpful. Internet Access at 3 pound per 15 mins.Connection to central London very easy via Waterloo or King's Cross.Shopping mall (N1) just one block away with shops like GAP, Woolworth, etc. Good choices for dining on the 2/F of the Mall, Yo Shushi, Japanese Noodle, Pub, Chinese Buffet resturant etc."
127,801,"May 29 2006 	Pleasant surprise	Spend 5 nights here in late May (business and leisure). The hotel is located 200 meters from a very convenient underground station (Angel on the Northern line which takes you to the vicinities of St Pauls, London Bridge and London Tower), whilst Islington per se is not a tourist attraction. 10 minute 13-15 pound night cab drive from downtown or 15 minute 17-18 pound cab drive to Paddington Station (for Heathrow Express). Supermarkets, cinemas and franchise eatings (from Starbucks to Wagamama) are all nearby.The neighbourhood has many little and less expensive restaurants, shops and bars (check out Kings Theatre on 115 Upper Street with free life music every night) where you can spend your evening away from the overpriced places, the tourist crowds or the noisy and drunken youth of Soho and Leicester Sq. 15 minutes walking brings you to the British Library with its magnificent exposition of very old and illustrated books.The Hilton is a pleasant surprise if you know London hotels (I know around 10 by know). Rooms are spacious (a luxury in London) and decoration is modern. Everything looks quite new and clean and doesnt smell (also uncommon in London). Only a few lame TV channels to keep you busy when it rains. Stuff is helpful but not going out of their way for you. Breakfast is a rip off (18+VAT) of if you pay it apart. Better take a morning stroll and eat double the food for half the price at any nearby Caf. Bathroom amenities are the minimum, ironing board in the room and quick/efficient housekeeping. Ask for a room facing backwards or the courtyard, since there are no views independently where your room is and at least you dont get the entrance ramp noise.Overall an adequate 4 star hotel, with a honest price/service relation, like you would expect in any other European city, but since this is London, it turned out a rather pleasant surprise for its star and price category."
128,801,"May 8 2006	Good Location 	My partner, daughter and I have just returned from our weekend at the Hilton, Islington. All three of us were very happy with our experience. Our room on the third floor was very spacious, it had two double beds along with a double sofa bed. There was no mini bar, however on departing the lift there was a vending machine with the usual minibar stock of drinks and snacks. It operated by inserting your room card and making your selection. The prices were very reasonable. The food in the hotel restaurant was quite nice however service was slow. Islington is a trendy part of London and filled with fantastic restaurants where service is not a problem. It's also an area where the atmosphere is lively but relaxing. Islington houses plenty of antique shops, however bring comfortable shoes as shoe shops are practically non existant. I would recommend this hotel and this area to anyone who wants to shop in the city by day (transport links are excellent) and chill out in the evening in an area where you can feel safe. The hotel is very good value for money and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone. My ten year old was impressed with both the Hilton and Islington so much so that she forgot she had brought her playstation and was happy to walk, eat, shop and not complain!!!!"
129,801,"Apr 19 2006 	Great Location for London Tourism or Business	Stayed here as part of a dual pleasure and business trip. Nice, clean business type hotel up to the Hilton standard. Staff was very helpful. About a 3 minute walk from the Angel Tube station, which makes getting to anywhere in London in 10-15 minutes very easy indeed. The best part of this hotel was the location in the centre of Islington and it's many shops, bars and restaurants within an easy walk. Will stay here next time in London!"
130,801,"Mar 21 2006 	I will never stay in a Hilton again	This has to be one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in in this category. The service was shocking; I stayed 2 nights, and on both mornings was woken at the wrong time for my wake-up call (on the first day, 2 hours early). I mentioned this at reception and didn't even get an apology, but the worst thing of all was the complete rip-off regarding internet access. Any other hotel I've stayed at which offers a 24-hour in-room access rate, calculates the 24 hours from the time you first log on. Not this one.I logged on for the first time just after noon, and again for less than 5 minutes just after midnight and they charged me for 2 full days' internet use. When I queried this on check-out the manager just told me that it was clearly stated (it wasn't) and basically tough luck. There was no water or mini bar in the rooms, (mostly) unhelpful and unknowledgable staff, and the worst corridor decor I've seen in a long time. What can I say on a positive note? They didn't lose my laundry. Islington is a great part of London, and if I go back there, I would stay 5 minutes walk from this hotel at the Jury's Inn where my folks stayed and had lovely happy, smiley service. I will go out of my way to avoid any hotel in the Hilton chain again in future. God, that makes me feel better, getting this off my chest. I travel regularly for work in lots of countries around the world, and I have never been moved to write a negative review before, but this place really got my goat."
131,801,"Jan 2 2006	This is a Great Property! Will Definitely Be Back...	Got a great price of roughly 85 pounds a night over New Year's weekend. Admittedly the gold member Hilton upgrade probably didn't hurt but I came away really, really, really liking this hotel and the Islington neighborhood.Lots of little bars and restaurants and cafes in the area I think what won me over with this hotel is that it's relatively small! And ironically that was a benefit. I also stayed at this hotel planning to take an early morning from London City Airport. Worked out perfectly. You can take the Tube from Angel to Bank and change there for easily for London City Airport. For those of you looking for an early morning departure from that part of London this hotel will work for you.What did I like about the hotel? Highly efficient front desk staff (Elvio was incredibly helpful and polite) and beautiful rooms. Hotel is modern in design, great location and I was very, very pleasantly surprised by the rate I got. Room is quite luxurious and bathrooms are nice.Enjoy your stay in the Islington area. And certainly feel free to use this hotel as your home while visiting any part of London."
132,801,"Aug 22 2005	A good base for a weekend in London	The Hilton is located just off the main street of Islington (Upper Street) by the British Design Centre. The nearest tube/metro stop is Angel (Northern Line) which is about a five minute walk from the hotel. Islington is a bustling part of London, and Upper Street has a great choice of shops, bars and restaurants, which you really should take the opportunity of enjoying rather than limiting yourself to the Hotel's restaurant and room service.The Hilton is undergoing refurbishment at the moment, BUT, unlike other london hotels, there is limited noise, and a lot of care from staff to ensure you have a good stay. Rooms are nice, and if you are lucky enough to be given a room on the 2nd Floor, (non-smoking only) these have just been refurbished and updated with more modern day furniture akin to that of the Executive Floors at the Hilton London Gatwick. Rooms feature all the things you would expect from Hilton. Rooms are air condtioned, but sadly, you cannot open the windows in your room for fresh air, which is a bit disappointing. Like the last reviewer, room service breakfast whilst nice, is cold by the time it gets to you, which is a shame really - as it is quite good. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but the service looked slow, and the food not that appetising, do yourself and your wallet a favour and take a walk into Islington.All in all a good hotel at a good price, would stay again!"

1,802,"Great hotel near everything!	My husband and I stayed at the Hilton London Kensington during our stay in London last week. What a fabulous hotel! We were given a corner room which was larger than most and the room was clean and comfortable. The nearest tube is Shepherd's Bush which was walking distance from the hotel. The Westfield Mall nearby is a shopper's heaven! They have high end and regular stores and tons of places to eat. My husband and I ate at Byron which serves burgers. The food and service was great. A little pricey but everything in London is pricey! I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who is traveling to London for the first time. Easy access to tube and buses, taxis everywhere and very safe neighborhood! One negative thing is the inter"
2,802,"Small but clean. Not the best location.	Overall, a decent hotel. Rooms on the small side for a family of 3. Clean. Good breakfast. Location is OK, but not the best. About 10 mins walk from the tube and shopping for the basics (as well as an upscale mall)."
3,802,"I wish we hadn't bothered	My wife and I stayed at he Hilton Kensington last weekend (27-29th of Nov 09 as a short get away from our busy jobs. We decided to stay ta the Hilton because we had an excellent stay at one of the Hitlon hotels in Glasgow (where we got engaged). Unfortunately we were extremely disappointed with several aspects of our stay. We selected a non-smoking room, however the room (2063) we received and the corridor it was on smelt badly of cigarette smoke. I rang the duty manager who was very pleasant and offered us two solutions - have the room freshened and/or move rooms the next day as the hotel was fully booked. We had booked a 2 night stay with breakfast and one eveening meal. We went down to the restaurant (which was not busy) and we were shown to a table that was not completely set. From our Glasgow experience we were anticipating a buffet style meal with a variety of choices. However we were disappointed to find an extremely limited and unexciting set menu (this needs to be highlighted on the Hilton's website as we would probably have booked without this evening meal included). There was an option to upgrade the meal, however the supplements in question were quite exagerated (for example 13 pound to go up to a grilled chicken dish that is 15.50 approx from the al a carte menu).My wife opted for the vegetarian options from the set menu (she is not a vegeterian). The spinah and ricotta tortolleni was extremely balnd and disappointing and she felt that tesco own brand fresh pasta and sauce would have been more exciting. My wife chose bread and butter pudding with custard for desert. She was again highly disappointed. The bread and butter pudding was very dry and nothing compared to what she made herself the week previous. The custard tasted school dinner like and was certainly powdered based. My starter was a very bland watered down 'fresh' pea soup. My main with an 8pound supplement (21.50 of the a la carte menu) was a West Eleven (restaurant name) fish and chips. The plate arrived with a mountain of chips, 2 small pieces of fish (apparently turbot) and stne cold mushy peas. The chips were nice and so was the tartar suce, but the whole meal was boring. I only chose this as the set menu was lacking in any good choices. My dessert was meant to be white choc cheesecake - however it was not available and I opted for the stoffee and pecan nut cheescake. This was also very boring. To summarise the meal I would say it was a waste of money and the service was certainly not 4*.That night we went to relax in our room as we had planned a busy Saturday. However, when we were about to sleep at about 12.30 we heard a group of girls banging doors and entering the room next to ours (2061) while shreking and screaming. We understand that there will be some noise, however the girls continued to get louder with intermittent screaming, loud laughter, music , the slamming of doors and running up and down the corridor. After this continued for approx 40 mins we felt that we had no choice but to ring reception. They agreed to speak to these rowdy guests. 5 minutes later we heard a member of staff knocking and asking the girls to kindly keep the noise down. They obviously didnt care as the door had just closed before they started again louder than ever. About 40 minutes later another staff member knocked their door (we hadnt made a second call and assume that someone else complained). This staff member (who introduced himself as a manager) again asked them to be quiet. He must have waited outside the room as very soon after he knocked their door and informed them that they would have to leave if he ahad to warn them again. Unfortunately, the grils continued to ruin our supposedly relaxing stay. We ended up not getting to sleep until well after 3am. The following day we were extremely tired and my wife decided to speak to the manager about our disappointing and unrelaxing night. This duty manager (female) was very helpful and understanding but she said she was unfortunately unable to deduct anything from our bill as we had paid in advance, she told her that she would speak to her manager about how they could compensate us for our lost nights sleep. When we returned to our hotel after a long day out we were given keys to our new room (7061) which was the same size as the previous room (relatively small), no mention was made at that time of how we would be compensated for the previous night. The following morning, after a more relaxing night's sleep, we went to breakfast only to be told that we could avail of the Executive lounge, this had obviously been done the previous day by way of compensation but unfortunately this had not been communicated to us, although we did enjoy a relaxing breakfast in the lounge, had we known that we had access the previous evening we could have made more use of this and could have enjoyed complimentry drinks and canapes and would have felt this was adequate compensation for the previous night but unfortunately due to poor communication we feel that we were poorly compensated for our dissapointing night.On our second night we went to a restaurant recommended be the concierge (Edera) - it was good but very overpriced and lacking adequate portions.The hotel was situated well as the original tour bus stop was directly opposite the hotel. The hotelw as close to shepherds bush tube stationa nd the large westfield shopping centre.We have come home from this trip without being relaxed and overall our stay was disappointing and we dont think we could could risk booking a Hilton hotel again as their is clearly no consistency."
4,802,Good location great service but small noisy rooms	This Hilton does everything right except the guest room doors slam shut and are loud enough to wake you from your sleep. I am returning to London shortly and will not be staying here again until this is repaired.This is a short walk to the Shepards Bush underground station and the new mall.
5,802,"Nov 20 2009 	Excellent hotel and staff - will stay there again!	I gave this hotel &quot;5&quot;s on everything. We stayed three nights and each one was pleasant. The staff went far and beyond what was expected. The hotel was extremely clean and well kept. Linens and towels were excellent. The rooms were exactly as promised. I know some said it was small but I think it is more accurate to state that space is well utilized. The hotel was accessible by tube and bus. The tube was right around the corner and the bus with all their double decker charm was right outside the hotel. You can take the tube from Victoria to Shepherds Bush or Holland Park via the Victoria Line and the Central Line. Or even more fun is to walk out of the station to Victoria Street and catch Route Bus 148 from Stop: G towards White City. The buses tell you the next stop and you just ring the bell to stop. A great web site for travel through the city is http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2605.aspx. You can find times, stops and best routes using the tube and buses on the Journey Planner. If you are in London you are going to walk. Taxis were available. I cant tell you how much we enjoyed the location, the staff and the rooms."
6,802,"Nov 19 2009 	Great value for a nice hotel	I booked this hotel on hilton.com, and got a rate of 89 pounds/night without breakfast. We got a big hotel room with a queen bed, desk, separate sitting area, and a tub/shower. It was really a great deal for such a nice room. As everyone else says, the hotel is in a nice tree lined neighborhood with easy bus and tube access. It was our first time in London, and we had no problem navigating the transportation. We really liked walking for dinner/drinks in Holland Park (Bombay Bicycle Company is great Indian food) and Notting Hill. I would definitely stay there again. My only complaint was that on the second night when we arrived with sore feet from seeing the sites, our keys didn't work. When we arrived back at the front desk to get them reprogrammed, the staff required that we wait in the long line to check in instead of quickly fixing the hotel's error for us."
7,802,"Nov 16 2009 	Nice hotel smallish rooms but good for what we paid!	We booked this hotel through priceline &quot;name your own price&quot; deal and paid 60 per night per room. The room was nice and recently renovated although it did not have a bath, just a shower, which is always a disappointment when going away for the weekend. The location was good, in Kensington, just a couple of minutes walk from the Westfield shopping centre and Shepherds Bush station. The only criticism I would have was the size of the room although the price we paid and the location made up for this."
8,802,"Nov 14 2009 	Comfortable Hotel	We have stayed at the Hilton Kensington on two occasions; once in April 2008 and in Oct 2009. Rooms are bright and cheerful; much improved following the renovation. Room size is not large but adequate. The most irritating point is that the room is full of brochures and the first task is to put everything away in a drawer and re-claim every available surface for my use.Breakfast menu has a wide selection but service at the restaurant can be inconsistent depending on how many staff called in late/sick or if there is a tour group staying in the hotel. Otherwise it can be a enjoyable experience. If you intend to have breakfast in the hotel, always book hotel room and breakfast at the same time for a better deal. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful.Hotel is close to the underground train station at Shepard Bush. If you are staying in London for more than 5 days, consider getting a 7 day underground pass that gives you unlimited use of the transport system within London.I will recommend and stay at this hotel again on my next trip to London."
9,802,"Nov 12 2009 	Fabulous hotel	Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in order to do some Christmas shopping. Check-in was easy and we were given a choice of room. Rooms were very clean and comfortable and towels were changed daily. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Breakfast was fantastic . . . most days we were so full we didnt need anything except coffee until around 5 o'clock! The food in the am/pm restaurant was also very tasty. A small gift shop in the hotel also stocked toiletries and medicinal products. The location of the hotel, although not in central London, was very good as it was 5 minutes walk to Westfield Shopping Centre and restaurants. Shepherd's Bush tube station is beside Westfield and Oxford Street is only 5 or 6 stops away on the Central Line (no changing necessary). Would definitely return to this hotel and would recommend a stay here."
10,802,"Nov 7 2009 	Refurbishment completed	I have visited this hotel about ten times I guess. During the last years there has been an ongoing refurbishment, which was completed by our last stay in october. The rooms are not big, but really nice and very clean. We were upgraded to executive rooms and lounge access due to our Diamond status, and enjoyed the complimentary wine and finger food in the evening. The staff in the lounge, the reception, housekeeping and concirgedesk are very nice and friendly. Hilton Kensington is good value in a nice area of London. The Westfield shoppingmall a three minutes walk from the hotel, has everything from Topshop to Dior and Louis Vuitton. No need to go to Oxford strret or New Bond street."
11,802,"Oct 29 2009 	The Best Hotel In London	It's the best hotel I saw it in London this is my sixth trip to London I spend 12 Nights at this hotel , nice location ,nice breakfast, nice staff, nice room and modern stile, I arrived at 10 AM and they provide me the room upon arrival after long flight trip, bus number 94 &amp; 148 (24/7) buses just in the front of hotel door 15 minutes to oxford street and 20 mints to pecadelyand mayfer, Westfield mall just 5 minutes walking from the hotel, many coffee shops and nice food near the hotel i liked the aria really, when i checked out they allowed me to sit till 3 PM and they keep my luggage till 8 PM because my flight was at 11 PM, really I recommend this hotel for everybody want to visit London, room size is average for London hotel and it's perfect for 2 persons :).Thanks Hilton Kensington for making my trip so nice.I love Hilton Kensington :)"
12,802,"Oct 26 2009 	Would stay here again	Very nicely appointed hotel. Room (1006 on the first floor) was v. clean, not super-large but comfortable. Breakfast buffet was good. My only criticism was that the toilet cistern took a long time to refill which meant you had to wait around 15 mins or so before being able to flush again.The hotel is technically just inside the Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, but a more accurate appellation would be the Hilton Shepherd's Bush as it is a stone's throw from Shepherd's Bush tube and so is extremely well situated for the Westfield shopping centre and venues like the Shepherd's Bush Empire (we stayed at the hotel after going to a gig there). Being right next to a Central line tube station means it's well placed for access to central London too. If you're looking for a hotel in this area, I'd recommend staying here."
13,802,"Oct 23 2009 	Wonderful location and hotel	We stayed here when in London for a couple of days prior to Easter. I found the stay amazing and so helpful, a great London hotel experience which I would recommend to anyone. Breakfast was well organised, no panicing, great selection of food (fresh food that is) and very attentive staff. We used the bar, restaurant and executive lounge and I found all departments really friendly, efficient and welcoming. Will definitely be staying here again on my next visit to London and as somebody who travels and uses hotels frequently this goes to the top of my list for great service and helpful staff in very relaxing surroundings."
14,802,"Oct 17 2009 	Overpriced Overhyped And unwelcoming unless you are a 40 year old businessman!	where do I start? myself and my girlfriend booked up this hotel for a week prior to a concert we were attending at wembley arena.First of all. Car parking. there is a large car park underneath the hotel. But that priviledge will set you back 30 for 24 hours. Meaning it would have cost me 180 to park my car for the amount of time I spent there! I ended up having to park at a lower price car park in the middle of canary wharf (about 40 minutes train ride away) for 50 for the week! But of course then I was spending the entire week worrying about my car! Not to mention the fact I had to drop cases and my girlfriend off, drive slap bang through the middle of london and out the other side to canary wharf, drop the car off and get two trains back to the hotel again!Next up the room. Nothing wrong with that. Quite spectacular actually. I decided to splash out on an executive room as a treat. This plus breakfast and dinner came to 1100. Not mentioned on the website at all however is the fact that the evening meal is from a set menu with VERY limited choice. Maybe something for the non veil and duck lovers amongst us would have been a better bet. Despite paying for a weeks meals, we only actually had our dinner there for the first night because of this. Maybe if it had been on the site I would have just opted for bed and breakfast.Now for the best part. When I stayed here, I was 22 and my girlfriend was 18. So I checked in, and was immediately told of a &quot;deposit&quot; of 50 which I had to pay by debit card or cash before they would give me the room. This despite me being 3rd in a queue of people checking in, but yet being the only person asked to pay this deposit! why is that I wonder?! When asked why I was told it was a policy. Asking why no-one else had been asked to pay this deposit drew a blank response of either pay the deposit or we cannot give you the room. hmm.Even better. on no less than 7 occasions(!) I was asked by security if I was supposed to be in the hotel, and was asked to present my keycard as proof. You can imagine the embarrassment of paying over 1000 for an executive room and everytime you enter the hotel, you are asked to prove that you are allowed in, in front of other guests. Also upon entering the executive lounge...which someone seen me open with my keycard, I was asked at the other side to prove I had an executive room and was allowed in there! I get the feeling unless you pull up in a BMW driven by your butler and aged over 45 you are NOT welcomed by the staff at this hotel!On the 7th night of my stay, I swapped to a bog standard hotel for the concert - the premier inn at wembley. We were treated a LOT better by the staff there, the food was a LOT better and I could park my car for a fiver a night!...directly under the hotel! The best park was, the standard room there was bigger and just as nice as my executive room at the hilton. despite being half the price!The hilton kensington could learn a lot from the premier inn!"
15,802,"Oct 16 2009	Loved it!	Just back from a long weekend here at the Hilton Kensington. Stunning hotel. Nothing a bother to the staff. Found evryone helpful and cheery. I'm struggling to understand many of the strange reviews on this site. Re; underground stations? Where were you actually staying as it certainly wasn't this.Restaurant:Breakfast; Good service. Good food.Dinner; Exellent! Food was delicious and staff (special mention for Chandrahas!) exceptional. This restaurant should be alot busier as the chef is quite obviously very skilled.Yes, the rooms aren't the biggest I've ever stayed in but, you're in London for goodness sake! Land's at a premium!Thank you Hilton Kensington for such a wonderful stay.....hope to see you soon!"
16,802,"Oct 12 2009 	Average Hotel	This hotel was conveniently located by Gloucester station; therefore, if you are traveling to and from Heathrow and you are traveling by tube (about 45 minutes), this is a convenient location to stay. The hotel should be considered a 3 star (not 4 star). This is a high traffic hotel where large tour groups stay. As long as you are not on the same floor as them, the rooms should be relatively quiet. The check-in/check-out process was fast and the concierge was very helpful. This hotel is also near Kensington Park, which is beautiful. Since the hotel does not offer free wifi, you can go to nearby internet cafes to access internet. There is also a pharmacy next to Gloucester station if you need to buy bottled water. The restaurant onsite had a good menu. My husband and I had dinner the first night we arrived there and enjoyed it very much (the mussels were great!)."
17,802,Oct 8 2009	Far From Underground Station	On a &quot;first class&quot; group tour; thus the big city hotel was not well located. 20 minute walk to the nearest underground station.
18,802,Oct 7 2009 	Good Place to stay	I spent three night at this Hilton. My rooms was not very big but it was clean tidy and had everything that i needed. Our door key kept not working and staff were very quick to sort it out. Didnt use any of the facilites or eat in the hotel. Really close to westfields for shopping!!!
19,802,"Sep 28 2009 	Clean and comfortable but overpriced	Clean hotel and decent room, but no better than many cheaper hotels that I have stayed in.Breakfast is overpriced, but there are several places nearby (including a Weatherspoons pub)The location is good for the underground. It is 5 minutes walk to Shepherds Bush Underground or slightly further to Holland Park.I paid 80 per night for 4 nights (room only) through Travelocity Secret Hotels. I realise that this is a good deal for the Hilton, but it was still overpriced. I would rather have stayed in a 2* or 3* hotel with breakfast included."
20,802,"Sep 27 2009 	Nice Hotel but Poor Service	Hilton London Kensington is nice hotel, nice area, as it is close to westfiled shopping centre, but the service is too bad, I am still in staying at the hotel (Room 6009) as my check out will be on Oct. 02, 2009. This is my first time in Hilton as I am Marriott member since 1988, but I really miss the service at Marriott. at the Hilton Kensington I keep calling the house keepering every day to ask them to finished uncompeleted job at my room."
21,802,"Sep 26 2009 	Good enough at a price	Stayed here for a couple of nights . Had stayed here many years ago, hotel much more modern now.Hotel is just in Congestion charge zone. Problem getting in to Car Park with barrier. Dealt with eventually with complete lack of charm.Room fine for the price, this is usually amongst the cheaper 4* Hiltons in London and is near to new shopping centre, and was quiet.Decent enough breakfast if you remember that less than 10 per person is allocated."
22,802,"Sep 26 2009 	EXCELLENT HOTEL WHOSE STAFF LOOK AFTER THEIR GUESTS EXTREMELY WELL	I stayed in this hotel after a trafalgar tour on 31 August 09 for 4 days and before the tour on 190809. The staff in this hotel treated me extremely well and made my stay extremely comfortable. Their customer service is impeccable and excellent. I was quite nervous after the tour on 310809 -being alone and this being my first visit to London. However, the concierge, front desk, staff at the West Eleven restaurant plus the cleaners from this Hotel did everything possible to make me feel comfortable and at home. Rashid, Sofiane, Khoo and others of the concierge helped me choose tours for London,taught me how to get around by bus and even called security and the police for me when I was harassed by a beggar near the hotel. I have yet to experience such wonderful service in any hotel I have stayed at and if there is any word that exceeds excellent, I would use it to describe the service I had receive. The front desk too provided excellent service. When I arrived from Australia to Hilton at 6:30am on 190809 I was about to physically collapse from the long trip.I told the front desk about it. They went out of their way to get me a room by 8am so that I can shower and sleep before I collapse. They were so good about it that I even received a call to see if I am happy about the room and if I am ok. Such service deserves an award and if there is an award that this hotel can get, I will be the first to recommend it."
23,802,"Sep 25 2009 	Average hotel if you get a good price	Me and my partner stayed at the Hilton Kensington last weekend and having a paid a price of 148 inc. breakfast (booked direct through the Hilton website - this was the cheapest I could find it at last minute) I have to say I was a little dissappointed, particularly after noticing that in a recent review somebody mentioned they paid 68 inc. breakfast.Our main disappointment was the size of our room, I had read previous reviews and noticed a few people had also mentioned this, but thought how bad could it be, I realised when we got to our room exactly what they were talking about, I dont think I have stayed in a hotel with such a small room, it was literally a box and a tiny bathroom with just a shower (no bath). It felt very claustrophobic and while I appreciate you do not spend all the time in the room, when youve had a busy day shopping in london and you want to relax for a couple of hours before you go out, when your in this small and pokey room its not very good. I wouldnt have thought the size would have bothered me but it really did!The location of this hotel is pretty good if you are not bothered about getting on the tube, with shepherds bush tube being the nearest and holland park in the other direction. If you walk up to holland park tube there are a few nice little bistro's/eating places to go to. There is also westfield park literally opposite, which is a really nice shopping centre (with some great food places to eat).The hotel has a car park underneath and there seemed to be plently of parking spaces and safe- it cost 30 for 24 hours (dont forget to get your ticket stamped when you check out) which I thought was pricey but this is pretty standard for hotel parking in London.We opted for the breakfast, which was pretty good, although we had to que for about 15 minutes which was a bit annoying, but still a really nice breakfast, with everything from a full english to cereals and fruit.My overall opinion of this hotel is basically if you can get a good price, i.e 68 inc breakfast then that is great, I would not however recommend this hotel for the price we paid (nearly 150 inc. b/f) for a standard double room, I know there are a lot nicer hotels for the money. For the price we paid I would rather have saved my money and booked in a premier travel inn for half the price and probably a bigger room!"
24,802,"Sep 25 2009 	BRILLIANT LOCATION	This hotel was in a brill location, very central and a lovely walk down from Holland Park Station to hotel. We were room only in hotel but found a great place for breakfast &quot;Paisserie Valerie&quot; which was only a short walk from hotel. The hotel is only 6 stops on central line to Oxford Circus and one stop away from Nottinghill Gate which takes you to Portabello Road which was definitely worth a visit. I thought the Hilton at Holland Park was a really lovely place to stay and I would certainly recommend it. Our room was very nice with all amenties you would expect from a Hilton hotel."
25,802,"Sep 22 2009 	Great hotel..would definitely stay again	My husband and i stayed at this hotel twice, one for a recent visit to London and another for our anniversary. They had a special deal going and we managed to get a suite for the price of a normal room-brilliant! The hotel is relaxing and very clean and the service of the staff is superb. The only complaint would be the price of dinner...we had been to eat at Le gavroche the night before and found we got better quality food for a better price there! Although the restaurant staff were brilliant and very polite. At night, the bar downstairs has a brilliant atmosphere, we spent ages there one night downing cocktails.The hotel is a fantastic location in a upper class Kensington neighbourhood with walkable distance to all the major sights and a nearby tube station. Would definitely stay here again, ignore all the bad comments!"
26,802,"Sep 21 2009 	Excellent location for shop til you drop ...	Stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel was lovely. Very clean, staff really helpful, excellent location. Right next to the Westfield Shopping Centre so you really can shop!Couldn't fault anything."
27,802,"Sep 19 2009 	Great hotel for a weekend stay	We stayed here on a sightseeing weekend in London. We had a very comfortable room on the 5th floor, no street noise and the whole hotel was very clean and smart.Good choice of food at breakfast , and all staff were extremely helpful and polite.We paid 62 for a twin room with breakfast, great value for London!"
28,802,"Sep 17 2009 	Good Hotel in Kensington	I'm a little confused about some of the reviews here and wondering if they stayed at the same hotel I did. This is a great hotel in London, and even better if you use a certain well-known travel booking service that has William Shatner as a spokesman to book your room.A couple of points about the hotel. It's not actually in Kensington proper, but in an area between Kensington, Notting Hill and Shepherd's Bush. It's about a 200 yard walk to the Shepherd's Bush Underground station, which is nice, but you have to cross two major roads to get to it. Fortunately, for the really busy one (West Cross Route, A3220) there's an underground tunnel that passes under it, so it's not that big a deal. The rooms are a bit small by American standards, but are quite typical of most European hotels I've stayed in; our room was totally fine for two people, but more than that would have been a bit much.The good: Great location, right on the Central Line into London. Quiet, well-kept area of town. Great service - check went smoothly. They didn't have our room ready for us when we got there, but it was like 10am so I wasn't expecting it and it was ready by 12:30pm. The bad: 15/day for internet access? Really? I've seen some high prices before, but that's just totally insane. And it's not even wireless, so if you're going to pay that outrageous price for Internet access, bring a Cat-5 cable with you. The hotel cafe is also very pricey: a coffee, a soda and a muffin ran us over 11; walk down the road it would've been under 5."
29,802,"Sep 16 2009 	Great Location and Service - One Major Design Issue	Stayed here in Feb 09 when attending the National Wedding Show. Camped in a twin room with one of my bridesmaids and we were very impressed! The room was neat and clean with modern furnishings and nice bath/ shower with Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products (yay!). However I have one MAJOR DESIGN ISSUE I feel the hotel should address - the doors! Being an engineer, I understand hotels have to meet certain regulatory standards regarding fire doors but surely there must be a door equivalent of the sort of soft close cabinet drawers you get in kitchens! A small family were on our floor and I think the kids were in a separate room from their parents because we could hear them moving up and down the corridor and banging the doors late into the night - not very pleasant when one is trying to get a good night's sleep after a long day at a trade show or sightseeing! Breakfast was great, long queues on Saturday morning but we didn't queue for long and they gave guests free drinks while queueing. Don't be put off by negative reviews as it is a very nice hotel with friendly staff. Plus close to the Central Line tube or can take a bus into South Kensington where the museums are or walk across the traffic island to the massive shopping mall (Westfield). I booked through expedia and had a smooth check-in and check-out except for excess tax to pay on checkout which I was expecting anyway because it does state when booking on expedia that &quot;local charges may apply&quot;. This review was mainly posted in the hope that a member of the Hilton design team (or whoever is contracted to design and build their hotels) will read and possibly incorporate some kind of noise reduction feature for the room doors if the hotel becomes due for refurbishment soon."
30,802,"Sep 14 2009 	Kurt 	My wife, babysitter, 2 children and I checked into the Kensington Hilton in August after staying in wonderful Hilton Hotels around the world. My wife is a gold member and I am currently a gold member (having been diamond for many years). When we checked in I kindly gave the front desk clerk my name, spelled the name and explained that we had two reservations one in my wifes name and one in my name. The lady at the front desk appeared to be in a funk and asked me for my reservation forms. I didnt understand the lady at first so she repeaded in a harsh tone that she needed to see my reservation forms. I found this unusual as when I usually check in at Hiltons they will pull my reservation up on the computer and I will be escorted to the executive floor check in or to a Hilton Honors check in area. This lady seemed to be confrontational so I took the time to pull up my travel documents and showed her the two reservations. Later, my wife agreed with me that the front desk needed skills in dealing with the public.When I mentioned to the lady at the front desk that we would like to be on the same floor as close to each other as possible she was indignant that one room would be on the 5th floor and the other on the 6th floor. In my years of traveling with family, and I do travel with family much more than the normal person, I have had issues getting adjoining rooms and even sometimes rooms close together, but rarely are there issues of being on the same floor. I figured I would deal with the floor separation, but traveling with a nanny and children pose different problems. Simply put I do not like my children age 7 &amp; 11 having to get on an elevator if they want to go from one guest room to the other guest room.Finally, we were turned over to the Hilton Honors lady and the room problem continued. It was the longest check in for me this year at any hotel. We were finally given rooms on the 6th floor but not very close. It was livable as my wife would be in one room with the babysitter and our daughter. My son would sleep with me. Dont ask, after weeks of traveling around the world anything goes.The entire check in process set a negative tone for the stay. Overall, the hotel has numerous positives as in location to a beautiful Westfield mall and convenient location to Shephard' Bush station. It is also easy to pick up a bus and be in the heart of London in about 1/2 hour.The executive floor services are located on the first floor adjacent to the primary restaurant. It is convenient for coming and going during the day, but not as nice as having an executive floor on the same floor as the hotel rooms. The staff at the executive floor were nice and helpful.The selection of breakfast items in the executive lounge was adequate and fine. The evening selection was also acceptable. The concierge staff at the entrance to the hotel seem more concerned with offering services such a bus tours on the red bus that stops across the street and other services where they probably get a service fee from the vendor than providing true concierge help and assistance. My first stay at this Hilton was back in 1975. I wasn't even a teenage back then. Over the years I have stayed at this hotel several times, but I am forced to put this property on my bottom 5 list of Hilton properties at this time.If you do get a chance to stay at this property a fun past time is watching the Thai airline crews check in and check out. Usually, flight crews come with a couple small pieces of luggage, but these crews come with multiple suitcases that consist of more luggage than I require for multiple month treks around the globe. Hum, are there auto parts in them there bags?"
31,802,"Sep 13 2009 	Awesome Location!	This hotel is so convenient to Westfield Mall which offers incredible shopping and free Wi-fi. The mall has a variety or restaurants to chose from, although I favored the Gourment Burger Kitchen. The hotel is very convenient to Shepard's Bush Undergroud but the 94 and 148 bus routes stop right in from of the hotel. The routes go from the hotel to Marble Arch, Oxford Street, and Picadilly Cirus, they go into the heart of London. I had a very good experience at the hotel with one exception, the main concierge attendent was short at times. On my last day, there was a female standing in the check-in area who was answering questions for guests and seemed very friendly and professional. The breakfast was plentiful and favorful. Overall, I had a great experience."
32,802,"Sep 7 2009	Slow in resolving overcharge issue	My sister in law and I stayed at the Kensington Hilton for a period of 12 days in June - on the night before departure we finalised the bill with nothing owing. At 3am on departure morning we had a bill slipped under the door to say we owed money. Went down to sort it out to be told by the Reception staff that they would speak to the accounts person when they got in to fix it, only to find when I arrived back in Australia my credit card had been charged more that AUD$500. I have been trying to get this charge reversed since 14th July 2009 and am just getting the run around, being told on several occasions that they will respond within 3 business days. We are now 8 weeks down the track and still no positive response from anyone. Hope they don't treat all their guests like this - Rachid on the Concierge desk was fantastic, breakfast and bar staff great, but the Reception staff need more training in being able to undersand the accounts side of a bill. Overall our stay was great, but the overcharge has made our stay disappointing."
33,802,"Sep 6 2009 	Check-in staff need training in customer services	Stayed at this Hotel for 2 nights Generally this Hotel os ok, situated within a few minutes walk from Shepherds Bush stations and Westfield shopping centre. Hotel was very clean and room make up service was excellent. On the downside there is a charge for internet access within the rooms of 15 per day using a cable (no wireless). There is also internet access from the ground floor bar at a cost of 4 per 15 minutes. This is just a rip off!Dont open or touch the minibar unless you want to be charged even if you just want to have a look. (maybe all hotels are similar in this, but it was a new one for me). Also the bottle of mineral water priced at 3.50 in the room is a joke considering they have the same bottles on the counter at breakfast which people can take away for free?Don't get me wrong, I am quite happy to pay for services etc. But i felt that this Hotel was just trying every way to get more money out of people.And the main downer for my wife and myself was the check in staff. We had a slight problem with the booking in, despite the reservation being made at least three weeks earlier. And trying to explain this to a young, non-English and inexperienced staff member was an unnecessary drawn out trauma. The young lad tried to ask his supervisor who was passing, (a rather stern faced jobs-worth of a woman), for advice and she just dismissed his question and looked contemptuously at us before moving on to patrol her territory! Eventually the problem was left unresolved and despite this, we checked in anyway and we then approached the concierge to ask for advice. This man was completely different and dealt with the problem efficiently and without fuss to our great relief!To sum up, this Hotel is clean, in a good location and was overall an enjoyable stay.Just watch that bill!And for added enjoyment make sure you sit on a table that gives you a good view of the breakfast room. You will enjoy the chaos as the staff try to keep with the demands of the guests (one guest was standing at the breakfast bar holding a bowl full of cereal and asked several members of staff for milk as the dispenser had run out-he was last seen waiting patiently outside the kitchen for at least 5 minutes!)"
34,802,"Aug 31 2009 	best place to stay in london	I have stayed on business many times at this hotel.i am always welcomed by the most friendly and competent staff and feel more comfortable here than in any other london hotelholland park is quite close to the centre and now next door to the best shopping areatravel to central london is easy, but at the same time the hotel is in a quiet areaI always ask for a room at the backThe restaurant is first class and there are many good eating places nearby in Notting HillWhy stay in the noisy centre and pay twice as much"
35,802,"Aug 8 2009 	Good but I've seen better from Hilton	Having stayed in a number of Hilton's both in the UK and abroad this wasn't quite up to the usual standard (room wise) - having said that though I got a good deal from Londontown.com (215 for 3 nights) so I can't really complain. If I'd paid more for the room we got I wouldn't have been happy though. Granted it was a standard room, however the carpet was shabby, the wardrobe door wouldn't shut, there was rust in the bathroom (I could go on) - all little things, but again not what I'd expect from a Hilton. Otherwise the room was clean and the bed comfortable. The staff were excellent - from the moment we arrived until the moment we left they couldn't do enough for us and all were very pleasant and friendly. Definitely 5 star service. Breakfast was very good - plenty to choose from and the food was always freshly cooked.I personally really liked the location - close to Westfield Shopping Centre and reasonably close to both Shepherds Bush and Holland Park tube stations (about 5 minutes walk).One thing I would say is that if you'll need to use the Internet bring your laptop - if you've got a laptop you can get Internet access for 24 hours for 15. If you want to use their computers they charge 5 per 15 minutes. I wanted to use the Internet for a few hours (and didn't bring my laptop) so you can imagine what it would have cost. I just walked up to Shepherds Bush where there's loads of Internet shops that charge about 1 per hour. I'd probably go back, but next time I'd definitely opt for an executive room."
36,802,"Aug 7 2009	Requested a twin but got a double.	Took a family member on a short 2 night break. We requested a twin bedded room for obvious reasons. Hotel reception said they only had double rooms left and so would ask housekeeping to make up another bed in the room. The bed was a hospital / camping bed. It came with 1 piece of someones body hair on the covers. The hotel seemed to be struggling for rooms and when we came down later on, several people were lying down with their luggage in reception. The breakfast was not great. Some of the hot food was cold or overcooked. We found the location to be okay. It was a short walk from shepherds bush underground station. I would not stay here again. Overall it was overpriced and not too welcoming."
37,802,Aug 6 2009 	Very Nice service and Food	I stayed at this wonderful hotel for 3 days and was totally pleased.I found and booked the hotel through Luxury Group directly and everything went smoothly from the beginning.
38,802,"Aug 4 2009 	Suited me fine	Good location for shops, transport, places to eat. Pleasant room. Near the park as well.Food was okay."
39,802,"Aug 4 2009 	Business 	The Hilton Kensington is very well located. Across the hotel is a bus stop where both the Hop On-Hop Off tourist bus stops as the regular bus (take the 194 down the street to shopping and Picadilly), 5 minutes away is a bus station and tube station. Right behind here is a new grand mall with 'posh' shops as Chanel and The Beers and regular stores like Marks &amp; Spencers. There are plenty of restaurants here as well. There are several pubs near by (Belushi on the next corner is a favorite of mine: live music, drink specials and crazy people to watch).The lounge for the executive floor is what made our trip. The breakfast staff left a little to want but the food was good and plentiful (empty trays will be refilled, have a few minutes patience), afternoon tea was simple and the evening happy hour &amp; snacks pretty much made our meals of the day. Most staff is very prompt and attentive. I received flowers for my birthday and inquired about a vase with housekeeping. They brought two up for me to pick within minutes and thoughtfully brought scissors so I could cut my flowers.The concierges desk is phenomenal! Great advice and service in arranging cabs, theater tickets or just advice on where to go.Down sides: executive or not, the bed was a full not a queen and a little hard and uncomfortable. Don't forget to have your mini fridge emptied as it has an automated registry (the sticker on the door telling you this was for us not very clear to see or read). The lobby rest rooms were nasty; not cleaned very often or looked in on? Overall staying here made our trip not only easy, as in getting around to meetings, but incredibly fun as well, as in surprise dessert for my birthday! I am looking forward to going to London again, and am working toward making this hotel my place to stay again."
40,802,"Aug 4 2009 	Overall a good experience	We had booked a 2 night stay requesting a quiet room on the top floor. We arrived from Heathrow at 1100 and did not expect our room to be ready, however as we had booked a room as Gold card members it was nice to have immediate access to the lounge where the staff were very attentive. Unfortunately there were issues with the previous guest checking out from our room and whilst everyone else was getting access to their rooms, we did not get ours until just on 1500 and then they had to swap us to another room rather than the original allocated. Room 6028 is nice but it is not quiet as it has the ice machine outside the door.We enjoyed breakfast in the lounge which we were glad we could get at as the queues for the dining room were so long. Breakfast range was very adequate, though food not as hot as it should have been.Evening refreshments in the Executive Lounge were very pleasant, again a good range and it was nice that the young lady came round and spoke to everyone about 15 minutes before the drink was to be taken away to check if people wanted one more drink - so often hotels just whip stuff away and if you have lost track of time you miss outRooms was clean and bed was the usual -I find all Hilton beds very comfortable and this one was indeed good.Elsewhere I had read it was better to use Holland Park Tube station if you had luggage, we did that on the way there, but it was a long walk and there were some stairs to negotatiate before the station lifts in fact the Shepherds Bush station is nearer and whilst it has escalators is very easy to negotiate then it is a step free 5 minute walk - go to the right across the road to avoid the few steps up to the roundabout. Although the roundaboaut is big, the pedestrian crossings are good.We found the Concierge a little dismissive of us when we asked for directions to a restaurant we had booked ourselves through recommendations from others. I think he was annoyed we were not letting him handle our bookings but he did give us correct directions once we had convinced him this was indeed where we wanted to eatYes I will return to this hotel when we come back to London if the price is right"
41,802,"Aug 2 2009 	Mixed Feelings ( Breakfast!)	Stayed at the hilton for 2 nights, staff very friendly and helpful. Room was o.k. Very quite at night on the 7th floor. The disappointing part was breakfast on the first morning, we went down at 9.45 to find a queue of about 30 to 40 people! decided to go for a walk, came back 1hour later walked straight into restaurant to find ---- cold porridge, cold scrambled egg, rock hard bacon and no plates also the servery was very messy! I have not found this with any other Hilton, so very disappointed. I did speak to the food manager who sorted something out for the next morning, but even so be aware when the hotel is busy this is how it will be. Overall good stay."
42,802,"Aug 2 2009 	Great Hotel and good breakfast!	I stayed here for 1 night in July as me and my partner went to see a westend show. The hotel is great. It is about a 15 min walk from Holland park tube station. We were offered breakfast for a reduced rate of 10, and the breakfast was great. All in all a really nice stay."
43,802,"Aug 2 2009 	Good hotel especially if you get the upgrade	We stayed at this hotel for five days and it was clean, comfortable and the service was good. My husband is a Hilton Rewards member and we received a room upgrade upon request at check in. This gave us complimentary breakfast, access to the executive lounge, which meant complimentary afternoon tea and happy hour, as well as free internet on the hotel computers in the lounge.The room was a decent size. The bed was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was large and clean. Internet in the room was extra.This is a big hotel with many guests coming and going. The location, near Holland Park, is on the edge of a lovely residential area on one side and a gigantic shopping mall and tube station on the other. It is not centrally located but the value we got, especially with the upgrade, made it worthwhile. We purchased Oyster cards for the tube and found it to be a fast and reliable way to transverse London easily.We had a flight booked out of Luton airport at 6am in the morning. This airport is about a 50 minute drive outside of London. I asked the concierge what our options were for travel at that hour and for that distance. He told me that my only option was to hire a car for 185 Euros. I knew there had to be another way and looked through our Rick Steve's England book - don't travel England without it - and found a Green Line Coach bus for 13 Euros each person. We took a taxi to Victoria Station and caught it. Bottom line is; their concierge either didn't know about this or chose not to tell me about it.Other than that one experience, the staff was helpful and friendly."
44,802,"Jul 27 2009 	Don't expect it to be in Kensington	Stayed one night at the Hilton London Kensington, I found the name misleading as I was expecting to be closer to the centre of London rather than in Shepherd's Bush!Having recently stayed at the Hilton Gateshead we were expecting a similar standard at this hotel, sadly it fell far short of that. The room was adequate but nothing more and a little on the small side. Breakfast was not up to the expected standard and there seemed to be a shortage of staff. Serving spoons rather than tongs made picking up the sausages and bacon quite difficult and many guests commented on this. We will certainly look for a more central location for our next visit to London. It was expensive for what we paid 135.Internet access if 15 per day, which I think is exhorbitant."
45,802,"Jul 26 2009 	great location for Westfield shopping centre	a friend and i were seeing Russell Brand at Hammersmith Apollo and wanted somewhere between the venue and the Westfield Centre as we were going shopping the next day. the hotel was easy to get to from central london using the tube. it is a short walk from shepherd's bush station. the receptionists were very friendly and the hotel room decor was modern and clean. the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and there were plenty of towels (always a plus for 2 girls staying together!). we decided to have a quick bite before the show in the hotel bar. the bar staff mixed us some fab cocktails and the food was pricey but nice. the hotel got us a cab very quickly and we even returned after the show for some late drinking in the bar. all the staff we spoke to were very helpful and friendly. good show, good stay, good shopping!"
46,802,"Jul 25 2009 	Great Hotel - Will be back	I have travelled widely and stayed in many top hotels but the service at this hotel was second to none. Every phone call to reception had an immediate response this despite the fact that they were in the middle of a very busy summer season. My son's problem with his t.v. was delt with in a manner of minutes. Check in was flawless, bags and room service arrived on time. Breakfast was fast and efficient. My pot of coffee arrived within one minute of ordering every morning without fail. The impression was a good team working flat out to make sure that each and every person was well looked after. My only gripe was that the room service dinner arrived not quite hot enough although the waiter was chatty and professional. This hotel is working on all engines and our stay was really enjoyable as a result. It always felt good to come back each evening after a long day. For a medium priced busy London hotel it doesn't come better than this."
47,802,"Jul 24 2009 	Poor excuse for a Hilton	Was so disapointed by this hotel. Holland Park is a lovely area in London, mix with the Hilton name and I was expecting far more than was delivered. I think this hotel was overpriced for a particularly average hotel. I've never stayed in a Hilton, but based upon this, I won't be staying in one again. Room very basic and not very clean, not a great breakfast and am just pleased i was only there one night."
48,802,Jul 22 2009 	Nice hotel but nothing special	The hotel is literally two minutes away from Shepherd's Bush tube station which is very convenient and on the Central line which takes you to Oxford Street. There are a couple of changes required if you want to go to Heathrow by tube but it is generally easy to get to. There is also a huge shopping centre at the tube station which is worth checking out.The reception area is very nice and the staff were pretty efficient. There is a concierge who can look after cases etc if the room is not available and we took advantage of this when we checked in and out.The room itself was very small - and I have stayed in some small rooms in big cities. There was perhaps 30cm at the foot of the bed to squeeze past. There was very little floor space for opening a suitcase or anything like that. There was a flatscreen LCD TV but honestly I doubt they could have fitted a TV in if it was not a flatscreen attached to the wall. The bathroom was equally small with quite a low ceiling. It didn't have a bath - which didn't bother us but perhaps you would expect a bath for that price.We did not have any food in the hotel so I can't advise on that. There are quite a few places along Holland Park Avenue - we didn't try any but there are plenty of options. Also a Vue cinema in the area.The thing about hotels in London is that average hotels are extremely expensive. I would say this hotel is case in point - over 100 per night for a pretty small room without breakfast.We were not in the room much but it would have been nicer to have a little more space - although it didn't ruin our stay.
49,802,"Jul 20 2009 	Nice hotel slightly outside of central London but easily accessible	Stayed at this hotel for one night upon arriving in London. Was actually a pretty good place to stay.The hotel is bordered by two interesting areas: Holland Park / Kensington area which is a relatively quiet, leafy street, and the Westfield London shopping centre, easily one of the most opulent malls I've seen outside of Las Vegas.The hotel appears to have been renovated during the past few years. The rooms were small, but well laid out and quiet. Although I don't think our rooms were renovated, they were in acceptable condition and I'll grudgingly admit that they were good by London standards, for the price we paid (57 GBP).The location is near Shepherd's Bush tube, though it is a bit of a walk around the mall, so I'd suggest the slightly longer but far more pleasant walk from Holland Park tube to the hotel. There also are a number of bus routes in front of the hotel, often an easier and cheaper alternative in central London. It really just is a few stops to Tottenham Court Road station, which is a good starting point for touring London.Overall, I recommend this hotel, especially to people who have been to London a few times and may be looking for a slightly different area to stay in. For first-timers, you may want to stay somewhere just a bit closer in to central London. But either way, a good bet."
50,802,"Jul 9 2009 	Another Fantastic Stay	This was my second time at the Hilton London Kensington, and it was another fantastic stay. The front desk personal were extremely friendly, and fast . I was able to check in early with no complaints or hesitation from the front desk. Last time I visited this hotel, they were in the middle of the renovation, so it was noisy during the day (which my partner and I didnt mind actually, since we were out in the city anyways.) On this trip, we were really pleased with the updated refurbishment, and how quiet our room were. The room was nicely decorated, and the bathroom was extremely clean (love the shampoos by the way.) The bed was also clean and comfortable. The hotel is near a Tesco Express, which is great if you want a quick walk and breakfast before hitting the town. Sheppards Bush tube/bus stop is just a very short walk also. The area is very safe, and I felt comfortable walking down the sidewalks even in the middle of the night.If there was one thing I could change, that is more control over the A/C. I really like my room cool (even during the winter) and that was kind of hard to do, otherwise the only major disappointment is not staying there longer. I will return, very soon, and will stay at the Hilton London Kensington."
51,802,"Jul 8 2009 	OK I suppose	Stayed with partner for an overnight Birthday treat, combined with a trip to Westfield, which is in walking distance.Booked a standard guest room, but asked for a smoking room on check in and were upgraded to an executive room on 2nd floor (all smoking rooms on 2nd floor) room was clean,b ut tiny, I mean really small. Bathroom was equally lilliputian, though nice shower. Breakfast included, was ok would have liked some non pork sausages.Very, very noisy, with traffic, police, ambulance sirens, all night long. Our ambience was further disturbed by seeing a couple having a physical fight outside our room. Not the hotel's fault obviously!Friendly staff, quick check out. A toothbrush kit would have been appreciated!"
52,802,"Jul 5 2009 	Lovely hotel easy transport links would return.	My friend and I recently stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. We had a twin room which was very clean and had all the necessary facilities, TV, safe, tea and coffee, etc. (with a kettle you could actually get more than 1 cup of tea from which was nice). We didn't use any of the hotel amenities, choosing to be up and out for the majority of the day, so I can't comment on the restaurant or bar, etc in the hotel itself. There are however plenty of cafes, restaurants, etc., a couple of minutes walk from the hotel, so we chose to go out and explore. As you come out of the hotel, to the right and about 5 minutes walk is a large modern shopping centre with lots of restaurants which are open late. To the left from the hotel and again about 5 minutes walk are local cafes, restaurants etc. We ate at the local Bombay Bicycle Indian Restaurant one evening, which served lovely food and had pleasant staff.The location is good, in a nice area, not far from Shepherds Bush or Holland Park tube stations on the central line. Although Shepherds Bush is slightly closer than Holland Park (2 minutes but across a busy junction), we chose to use the Holland Park station, which was a lot quieter (no escalators for those with cases, but thankfully a lift which was even better). The station is only a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel, along a pleasant tree lined street. There is also a Tesco just before the tube station which we found handy. Continuing up another half mile from the tube station and to the left, you head into Nottinghill and the famous Portobello Market (saturdays). Basically just follow the crowd and you can't miss it! Wear comfy shoes though, the market is huge.We certainly had no complaints about the hotel which served our purpose nicely and would recommend it as a place to stay in a nice area."
53,802,"Jul 1 2009 	London break- great location average rooms	Hilton Kensington is in a great location, close to two tube stations and bus route just out the front.The Restaurant Staff were very courteous and the food was great.The Reception Staff were at times difficult to get assistance from and the rooms are VERY small and in need of a refurbishment. They were clean and the housekeeping team that we encounted were pleasant and professionable.If you are not in your room for any length of stay, it is not a bed place to stay."
54,802,"Jun 30 2009 	Great Hotel ......but.....	Really nice hotel , great staff , nice area , very close to westfiled shopping centre , Hop on Hop off tour bus starts just over the road , BUT..... a massive wait in the evenings for your meal , if you eat in the evenings at this hotel make sure you you have a few hours spare !!! no kidding on our second night we couldn't even wait for dessert , we just went without , we had already been in there hours !!! such a shame as this was our only complaint ."
55,802,"Jun 27 2009 	Fine for 1 night stay.	The usual standard Hilton, not central location but near the tube, room was ok, could hear next door TV and talking, so sound proofing is not adequate. Breakfast very slow, fine for 1 night stay."
56,802,"Jun 26 2009 	Avoid 2095 - and the Restaurant	On arrival allocated room 2095, a shoe box size room with no bath. No way would I stay in a room of this size for 3 nights. So small you have to walk round the bed to get into the room and the TV is wall mounted due to lack of space. Are Hilton proud of the manner in which they accommodate their Silver VIP Hhonors members? Returned to reception where a room change was no mere formality. Laura trotted off twice to confer with the manager and only after some delay was I granted an alternative room on the 4th floor. This appeared to be a standard room which had at least a bath in a tiny bathroom and begs the question as to how room 2095 could be described.Our restaurant experience was also a dire affair. This dull, windowless room was understaffed to the extent that we had to ask twice for water, twice for re-fills and wait a long time for our order to be taken and also between courses. I point no finger at the waiting staff in this respect. Staffing levels are just not adequate and cannot cope.Unfortunately it was the same sorry story at breakfast. Tables not cleared, no side plates, hot breakfast served on cold plates - I could go on but to what avail?The Hilton name used to be a guarantor of quality, at the Kensington it falls very far short of that standard."
57,802,"Jun 24 2009 	LOVE LOVE LOVE!	What a find! It is kind of off the beaten path but oh so worth it. It is located on a cute little street that seems out of a picture. There is a little gelato place on the same street towards the underground that is absoultely fabulous! I would stay here again in a heart beat! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that our toilet did not work well. Oh, they also charge a large fee for using the internet. Don't foget to visit Nottinghill! It is literally a ten minute walk from this hotel. VERY CUTE!"
58,802,"Jun 24 2009 	Mega breakfast lacking in one thing for me	Great location , excellent for transport to other places. My second time at this hotel, last was as a single person. Twin room can be claustrophobic for 2 people. I am a smoker and my companoin was a non smoker, she was o.k. with this but I wish there was an area outside the hotel to sit in comfort and have a drink and a cigarette so I did not pollute the bedroom for my non smoking friend. As usual the buffet breakfast was incredible and could set you up for the whole day. Cleanliness of room could not be faulted. I asked for a small fridge in the room when I checked in and this was provided . I know it is possible to get 5* accommodation for last minute bookings in London at a discount but why bother taking the risk ? If you can book ahead and know for sure what you are getting this is a good option."
59,802,Jun 23 2009 	Loved it!	Just returned from 5 night stay at the end of our trip and very much enjoyed the neighborhood and the hotel. Although we were not one of the lucky ones to have our room upgraded we made do with the space in a standard room and managed quite well. It was kept spotless and tea/coffee cookies were replenished each day. The concierge service was always helpful and pleasant and the one meal that we ate there (because we were too tired to go elsewhere) was very good. We would most definitely return.
60,802,"Jun 21 2009 	Guest orientated hotel	Stayed here for one night with my wife. Generally, a pleasant and commendable stay. This hotel stands out because all staff treat guests with respect - they are prepared/have been trained to give that little bit extra and nobody had an indifferent attitude. They also greet and talk to guests in a helpful and positive way.Pros: straightforward check-in and out; the attitude of the staff towards guests was excellent; bus stop outside hotel (in both directions); ten minute walk to Holland Park tube station; located on pleasant tree-lined avenue; brilliant upmarket Westfield Shopping Centre within walking distance; large executive lounge with plenty of choice for breakfast and pre-dinner nibbles and drinks and also free internet access; plenty of areas for sitting down and relaxing on ground floor; good breakfast in large restaurant; hotel provides value for money for Central London.Cons: evening meal in hotel restaurant (dinner b&amp;b basis) offered a limited choice and although the service was good, the food was only satisfactory; the bedrooms (even the executive ones) were small- and the black painted areas in the bedrooms was a bit downmarket. I would recommed this hotel if you are looking for good value and good quality guest relations in this part of London."
61,802,"Jun 16 2009 	Reasonably priced in a location just outside of the hustle and bustle.	We stayed at the Hilton Kensington in April of 2007 and were more than pleased. Most flights from the US to Europe get you there before check-in at hotels. The staff was more than happy to secure our luggage in a closet until our room was available. There were plenty of other bags in the closet, so apparently we weren't he only ones. The staff also assisted me with contacting the airport where I had left a bag...ugh. The hotel staff did everything short of driving me to the airport.When we checked in we found the room to be in good condition. I wouldn't even consider the bedroom small. The bathroom was a bit on the petite size, but served its purpose.Our 9 night stay didn't tempt us to eat at the restaurant on site, but we did stop off at the bar for a couple of drinks. All of the staff were pleasant and the concierge was top notch (I forget his name, but remember he was Algerian). The hotel is located between Shepherd's Bush and Holland Park tube stations. There is a bus stop right outside of the front door, so public transportation is at your beck and call. The hotel is located on a main road that will take you through Notting Hill, the north side of Hyde Park, Marble Arch, and into the shopping district at Regent Street.The conierge arranged for a taxi to pick us up at 6:30 AM the morning of our departure. The taxi was actually waiting for US!!! I would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to save a few bucks in London and who doesn't need high cost amenities."
62,802,Jun 15 2009 	All round great	Lovely welcome and nice room. Excellent service in the bar to quickly accomodate 20 of us for drinks and snacks. The staff couldn't do enough for us.
63,802,"Jun 12 2009 	Great stay - wonderful area!	Stayed one night and was not disappointed. Typical large Hilton, but still attentive to service - very pleasant check in staff and waiters at breakfast. Clean, comfortable and in a wonderful trendy location. Complimentary wine was a lovely touch."
64,802,"Jun 10 2009	Very enjoyable stay	My family and I just stayed at this hotel for 5 days for our trip to England. The rooms were okay in size, very clean and quiet. Our rooms face the roundabout just outside the hotel, but I could barely hear the noise from the street. The complimentary tea/coffee/cookie was refreshed daily. Hotel staff was polite, friendly and helpful. The location was excellent; it's a 5 min walk to the new Westfield Mall and the closest Underground station (Shepherd's Bush), and about 30 mins from Heathrow Airport by taxi. There are also bus stops right in front of the hotel. Prices for the rooms were reasonable. We've already decided to return to England next summer, and will definitely stay at this hotel again."
65,802,"Jun 9 2009 	No complaints	We stayed here for 4 nights and would come back again. Very clean and spacious room, attentive service, and 24 hour lounge. Close to two tube stations and a lot of shops within walking distance. The Greek restaurant across the street has the best taramasalata I've ever had. After I checked out, discovered I left my favorite dress in the room. Called and they said no worries, I could pick it up whenever. A week later, I stopped in before heading back to the US and they quickly brought my dress out. The internet access was a whopping 4 pounds for a half hour, so skip that and head to the many internet cafes past the Shepherd's Bush station."
66,802,"Jun 9 2009 	Fantastic Stay	We stayed at this hotel for three nights 5th-8th of June and it was a fantastic stay.From the minute we checked in until check out the hotel was just great.First we were given an upgrade to an excecutive room complete with lounge access and this was a big bonus. The room was spotless and by no means small,it was on the 6th floor with a massive comfy bed so there was no problem at all getting a good nights sleep.All the staff that we met were so professional,but also very friendly and helpful,they could'nt do enough for us and I do mean all the staff. Next is the food, it to was very good as we were on DBB we ate in at night as well as breakfast.The food was good but was limited in selection for diner,but hey it was still fine as we were only there for the three nights.Breakfast was the usual Hilton 'one' just great, excellent selection and quality. I would recommend this hotel no problem and if we ever return to London we shall not hesitate to book here again.A BIG thanks to all the staff who made our break so special."
67,802,"Jun 8 2009 	exemplary service	We have stayed at this hotel many times since our daughter lives in the neighborhood. On this visit, I overlooked retrieving my American money from the roomsafe when I left, and, upon inquiring, was very pleasantly surprised to learn that the purse had been turned in. The hotel seemed to be much busier than usual--perhaps the Westfield Shopping Center practically at the doorstep, is responsible. Other reviewers have commented that the hotel is a bit out of the way for London attractiions. However, the neighborhood is so lovely-very enjoyable to stroll around Holland Park and Notting Hill--and gives a differerent aspect to a London trip."
68,802,"Jun 5 2009 	One off a kind........	Stayed there for two nights,rooms are big and verry clean.The buffetbreakfast is verry nice and everything you like is there.A wonderfull place and good service.Worth the money you pay."
69,802,Jun 3 2009 	simply loved it	Great hotel
70,802,"May 29 2009 	Exactly what we wanted	My daughter and I used this hotel for five days as a base for touring universities outside London. It was perfect for us: light, airy and very clean room, with enough counter space in the bathroom, and a nice view of leafy trees out the large window. The walk from Holland Park tube station was lovely, with charming shops and a supermarket along the way (Sheperds Bush was closer, but we enjoyed the walk, and bus service is outside the front door). We did check out Westfield shopping center...lots of retaurants there as well, and the biggest Boots drugstore in the universe. A few cons: expensive internet access in room (15 pounds for 24 hours running noon to noon, though cheaper with different terms in lobby); we kept the window open instead of using the air conditioner and there was quite a bit of traffic noise; weak shower pressure, but not a dealbreaker. Admittedly this hotel is not in the center of the action...a plus for us as we've been to London a few times before, but I'd recommend for first-timers as well if you're looking for value for money."
71,802,"May 24 2009 	We'll be back for sure!	Just completed a stay that totalled - including a weekend away in the country - two weeks. And I have to say it was a great choice. Of course, if you arrive at 9 a..m. from your transocean flight and checkout is 11, there's a chance there won't be a room available. So stash your luggage and go for a walk or bus ride! And yes, the rooms are small, by North American standards, but no smaller than comparable London hotels, and - at least they are clean, well sound-insulated, and everything works! Location couldn't be better: True, it's not dead-center in London, but you're in a real London neighborhood, only a short walk from the Shepherd's Bush tube (10 minutes to Oxford Street, max.) and - even better - several bus routes into central London stop right at the hotel door! (We used our Oyster Card on the busses and got a free tour of London with every ride!) Plenty of local restaurants - both at the sumptuous, brand-new Westfield shopping center and (in the opposite direction) along Holland Park Avenue. Best of all: The breakfasts (included with our room, and easily worth 15 per person) - I have never seen a buffet to rival it: Made-to-order omelettes, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, yogurts, fresh fruit (pears, melon, orange slices, and more), porridge and dry cereals, pancakes, sausages, fried tomatoes, croissants, wholewheat breads, smoked salmon, cheeses, and more. We simply snaffled rolls, apples and some cheese from the buffet and rarely had to buy lunch! Lukacz, our favorite maitre d', makes sure you get your coffee or tea, plus choice of juice, delivered within seconds of your being seated. Two complaints: An overly-soft mattress in our second - post weekend - room: No biggie. And a truly rip-off charge of something like 6 an hour for high-speed internet use! (We found several places a few minutes away in Shepherd's Bush that charge just 1 an hour, and many Cafe Nero and Prete cafes have free wi-fi. So does the British Library at Euston.)That said, we'll be back for sure!"
72,802,"May 20 2009 	Great hotel	Superb location as we were attending a concert in the Shepherds Bush Empire. Good room, smallish but that's par for the course in London, nice Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. The staff were lovely and breakfast was very good, we did get a bargain at 65 including breakfast and I'd definitely stay here again. We also ate dinner in the restaurant and it was pretty good as far as hotel food goes and reasonably priced."
73,802,"May 19 2009 	Great Location Clean 	This hotel has a great location in the Holland Park area - about 4 blocks from the Holland Park tube stop on the Central Line. There are many small restaurants and several small convenience stores nearby. The area near the hotel is safe to walk around and is adjacent to some of the more expensive residential property in London. The room is reasonably sized with the usual Hilton amenities. There is a well stocked coffee/tea tray in the room as well as a hair dryer and iron. We have had some bad experiences in London staying in small independent hotels, local chains such as Thistle and Guomon and B&amp;B's and so decided to give this Hilton a try - it was nice to stay in a well ventilated room that had an en suite bath with good water pressure - so what if the ambiance isn't &quot;local&quot; - after a day of business or site seeing, it is nice to come back to clean, comfortable and safe accomodations!"
74,802,"May 12 2009 	Happiness At The Hilton	I spent four nights here as part of a stay over in London. Its a beautiful hotel and rooms are nicely decorated with tea and coffee making facilities. I gathered my room was one not recently renovated since I found some dirty marks on the carpet and wallpaper, compared to my friends room which had undergone recent refurbishment. I attempted to arrange to have my room earlier by emailing the hotel a week before hand with my request, was willing to pay additional for this because I was going to the theatre in the afternoon and evening and wanted to drop my luggage off and change. Sadly my room was not ready at 12pm but they offered me a small double room, sadly they didnt reduce the price which I find a bit of a con but I guess its how they make their money. The concierge is excellent, I was expecting a delivery on the Tuesday and I let them know. When I returned back from some shopping they informed me it had arrived and had been put in my room which I thought was nice of them! The bathroom was tiny, too small and the shower had a large step up to it which is not suitable for people with disabilities, I stubbed my toe several times trying to get into the shower! The mini bar is overly priced as is the hotel bar but then its the Hilton. Good tip for basics nip to the Tesco Express on the bus down the road, get off a Notting Hill Gate and youll spot it plus save a fortune in the long run! Location is good, buses are frequent and taxis are on hand outside the hotel night and day. I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again should I managed to afford to visit London again!"
75,802,May 7 2009 	Absolutely brilliant	I have just come back from staying at this Hotel. me and my husband stayed here for one night. we booked the hotel through londontown.com and got it for 65 per room per night including breakfast. I would most definitley stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. the service was brilliant and the rooms were compact and very clean. A great experience all round.
76,802,"May 7 2009 	Seventy five pounds for 7 days Internet access !!!	This was my first stay in this hotel. The location was perfect as business took me further West and the hotel is a good middle distance between Heathrow and Central London. It should more properly be called Shepherds Bush Hilton given it's location.The Staff were friendly upon check in. However I couldn't believe they wanted 75 pounds for Internet access! Eventually I ended up paying this exhorbitant amount. I was given incorrect advice at Reception about the access spanning the two halves of my trip (I checked out at the weekend) and had to get a Supervisor to review the situation. They ended up upgrading me to an Executive Room with access to Internet in the room plus access to the Executive Lounge only to call the next evening and say they'd made yet another error and that although I could have the Internet I was not going to have access to the Executive Lounge. My experience was that the Reception staff looked to find some way to blame the customer for their mistakes.One of my towels has a nasty big handprint on it - looked like someone had motor oil or something on their hands! I informed Housekeeping.The Restaurant was lovely and service was a little uneven in quality but overall friendly and portions were good. I was there when they had a Spanish theme and the Tapas was very good.The beds are very comfortable and Room Service was prompt, friendly and the food was piping hot.Overall a better hotel for Leisure rather than Business seeming to cater to large tour groups and sports fans rather than the business traveller."
77,802,"May 6 2009 	wonderful place to stay	Just recently stayed at this hotel for a 3 day stay. Rooms were neat and clean, staff was very pleasant. Bar area was great, food and drinks very reasonably priced. The resturant was nice, breakfast in the morning was buffet and a various things to chose from. We were very pleased with our stay here."
78,802,"May 1 2009 	Lovely hotel great breakfast!	We stayed at this hotel for a weekend during March. The room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast was great with plenty of choice and good service. Food at the bar was lovely too. Location was good, only a short walk to the Underground. Only thing to be prepared for is high car parking cost at 30 per 24 hrs."
79,802,Apr 28 2009 	Great hotel - will stay again	I stayed at this hotel on 14th April 09 and thought it was great. The check-in staff were very friendly and gave me a choice of rooms. I then had a call in my room after about 15 mins to check all was ok and it was. The room had everything I needed and was tastefully decorated. My view wasn't great but that didn't bother me as I had lots of work to do! I ate at the restaurant - WestEleven in the evening. I opted for the 20 menu for 3 courses. The food and ambience was perfect. The buffet breakfast was also very nice  loads and loads of choice and great healthy options. The hotel is situated perfectly for Westfield Shopping centre - a 5 minute walk. The underground is near by too. I was travelling alone and felt totally safe in the hotel and surrounding area. I would definitely go back for work or pleasure.
80,802,"Apr 23 2009 	Great service and location	Hotel was very clean and welcoming. Check in staff were very friendly. Beds were not the best, however staff were able to find us a better bed. Breakfast was great. Location is in a good area and not far from central london. Bus stop right outside and mall close by. No laundry facility on site. One close by, &quot;but not the best&quot;. Would stay at this hotel again."
81,802,"Apr 21 2009 	Small rooms but clean and good location	The location is great, with easy &quot;tube&quot; access (Shepherds Bush). Many restaurants close by. The room was very small with barely enough room to walk around bed. Windows look right out on other rooms in close proximity. Bed a bit wobbly. Closet space very limited. Room was very hot on arrival due to sun exposure, but A/C worked well and got temp to sane level in about an hour. Due to space, TV mounted on the wall in a corner of room. Reasonable quality but not a lot of channels.Desk space limited and Internet access very expensive (15 pounds per day). Bathroom small but functional. Shower stall very small and with very limited ceiling height. Lots of small detail problems: alarm clock not working, shower head not quite right, musty smell in hallway, but nothing major."
82,802,"Apr 18 2009 	NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER.	Stayed 20th March 2009 for 3 nights. Room was on the 4th floor, Kingsize bed, widescreen t.v. bathroom with bath and overhead shower. (crabtree and evelyn toiletries in bathroom) All very clean and perfect.Check-in staff very accomodating and efficient. The doorstaff were very attentive and helpful.Breakfast was excellent,including omlette bar. Plenty of choice for the health conscious option, or not as in our case.(full english all 3 mornings)Would certainly stay here again, and would have no problem recommending this hotel to anybody.Can't wait for next years London weekend break.Age of party 45 &amp; 49."
83,802,"Apr 17 2009 	Some good mostly bad	Recently stayed for 4 nights with my wife over Easter. The hotel has some good points but was mostly dissapointing.Whether the location is good for you or not will be highly dependent on what you are looking for. The hotel is not very central - its in a fairly quiet residential area on Holland Park Avenue. Its very close to the Shepherd's Bush tube station on the Central Line (Tip: the Hilton website tells you its near the Holland Park tube station, which it sorta is, but Shepherd's Bush is much closer).and right next to a bus stop (Tip: do not take a bus to Camden. It took ages and was a very unpleasant trip. On the other hand the trip to Victoria or Marble Arch is much more pleasant than taking the tube), so you can get anywhere in London pretty easily, but if you want to be walking distance from major tourist areas this hotel is not for you. On the other hand its very close to Notting Hill and Portobello Rd, and its also right next to the huge and very impressive new Westfield Shopping Mall which is definitely worth a visit if you want to shop. Its got all the usual main street shops, plus some decent restaurants. For us the location was just fine.The hotel itself is pretty drab, and reminiscent of a railway station when busy. The building is flat out ugly, the Lobby not very attractive. Its all clean and modern, just very ...blah. Our room was TINY. Even by London standards. There is barely any closet - enough for 2 coats, maybe a suit or a dress. There is virtually no draws to put away your clothes and worse still nowhere to put your suitcase (which you have to live out of anyway). The bathroom was microscopic. One other problem - the rooms are not well ventilated. I couldn't believe that in fairly chilly weather (down to 5-6 degrees at night) we had the window open, the heating off and it was STILL STUFFY AS HELL. I hate sleeping with AC, but that's what I was forced to do. As fas as cleanliness and decor is concerned it is modern, clean and pleasant enough. I wasn't crazy about the bed. Its a regular double (you couldn't fit anything bigger in the room anyway) and was way too springy. Felt like a foldaway.They have Internet in the hotel, but its very expensive - 15 pounds per day. (Tip: you can get a prepaid wireless dongle from T-Mobile for 30 pounds, plus 10 pounds for a weeks access giving 3GB per day (plenty!!). This is a total of 40 pounds, so its worth it for a 3 day stay or more.)Breakfast was included which was a mixed blessing. Ok, so we were there over Easter and the hotel was pretty full, but I think its inexcusable that we had to stand in line for 30 minutes to get a table. It wasn't that it was so crowded, there just weren't enough people to clear the tables. For god's sake Hilton, how about putting enough staff on duty for busy periods!!! The food itself was adequate. Nothing spectacular, but adequate. There was a guy making omelets, there was a choice of pastries, fruits, bacon, sausages, etc. We didn't eat any other meals in the hotel, nor did we use any other facilities. There is a bar in the lobby which seemed quite lively.We paid 110 pounds per night including tax, which was pretty much spot on in terms of value. In other words, in an expensive city I would hate to pay more than that for this place. In fact, I would put this hotel on par with a Holiday Inn which I would generally expect to pay a bit less. Don't let the Hilton brand fool you, this is not a fancy hotel."
84,802,Apr 16 2009 	Queuing for Breakfast	Nice hotel at nice location. Rooms are clean a bit too small though.Worst experience here was we had to queue for 30 minutes before we could get breakfast. Staff was doing its utmost best but clearly a management mistake understaffing a full hotel that week end.
85,802,"Apr 15 2009 	Good base and great value.	Well located hotel, close to Shepards Bush tube. We got a very good deal - 100 per night for 2, B&amp;B on the easter bank holiday! Room was clean and well appointed, with a large bed. The gf also really liked the toiletries. The breakfast was excellent and all of the staff we met were friendly and courteous. Recommended."
86,802,"Apr 15 2009 	Nice location	Short review,not much to be said,it's a nice hotel,lovely location.helpful staff a short walk to the tube and plenty of shops nearby."
87,802,"Apr 14 2009 	Good location but tiny bathroom	We stayed at the Hilton Kensington for one night and whilst the location could not really be described as Kensington, it is still a very nice area. The walk down from Holland Park tube station takes you past a very pleasant pub and a number of cafes and patisseries. Turn left out of the hotel and you are practically at Westfield Shopping Centre so it is very easy to find things to do in the locality. Whilst the location is excellent the room was not quite so good. It was furnished nicely but there was evidence of a substantial leak from the roof which had stained the carpet and looked very unpleasant. The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was good. The main complaint though was about the bathroom. It was tiny. This would not usually bother me but it was so small I could barely stand up in the shower (I am 6 foot tall). Not really acceptable for 125 per night. Also noise seemed to travel very easily between rooms and I was woken several times by slamming doors in the night. If you get a good room with decent size bathroom this hotel would be a good choice but I didn't so I wouldn't be inclined to return."
88,802,"Apr 14 2009 	Very good Hilton	We were a bit nervous having booked this hotel as a 'secret hotel' on Lastminute.com realising it was not in the West End. It is not in Kensington it has to be said! It is at the western end of Holland Park Ave, near to Shepherd's Bush. Having said that, we need not have worried. The hotel is in a pleasant , safe area which is quiet too even though the hotel is on a main road. It is close to Westfields shopping mall, small local shops, good local pubs &amp; tube stations. It has a bus stop immediately outside the front door from where you can catch a variety of buses into the West End in no time at all. With an 'oyster card' a bus journey is 1 and far more interesting than sitting underground! We only stayed for one night but I expect you could walk into Kensington quite easily.The only downside for us was that lastminute had not communicated our reservation to the hotel before we arrived! This could have been a problem as the hotel was very busy but luckily we did get an excellent room for an even better price (approx 60 - bargain!). The receptionist we dealt with was as good as I have ever come across, he sorted out a problem with very little fuss. The staff all had a 5* attitude but were not in the least bit stuffy. You can also eat and drink here without taking out a second mortgage.The hotel has a very pleasant atmosphere and the staff are brilliant - very friendly. Where else would you get a friendly 'hello' when you walk in the door at a large city hotel?! Everyone we came across was helpful and efficient. The room was not huge but very clean, comfortable and more than adequate. Better in fact than many rooms at a much higher price. We would certanly recommend this hotel and return on a future trip."
89,802,"Apr 11 2009 	Excellent hotel great location!	I stayed at Hilton London Kensington for three nights on the Easter week. I found the hotel from the hhonors.com web site, and booked it after reading positive reviews from Tripadvisor.com. Even after all the nice comments from fellow reviewers, I was still positively surprised. The hotel really lived up to all my expectations.Check-in was courteous and quick. I arrived at the hotel at 11 am, and was given a room straight away.My room was on the 3rd floor, and it was overlooking the mechanical plant on the roof. Not much view there, but not a problem either. The room had an OK sized working desk, a king size bed and a lounge chair + small table. All quite comfortable and clean. The dcor is modern but comfortable. There was also a flat screen TV, although the picture quality was somewhat poor. The spotless bathroom was standard fare with a bath tub. There is a large safe in the room. I was able to fit my wide-screen laptop + all camera equipment there easily.Breakfast was served in the chic WestEleven restaurant on the ground floor. The buffet had plenty of choices with made-to-order omelets and pancakes. Real nice start for each day.The location of the hotel is great. Its five minutes walk from the Shepherds Bush tube station on a quiet residential area. (Note for others who navigate themselves from the tube station to the hotel for the first time: The hotel is on the other side of a large roundabout. Walk from the _left_ side of the roundabout to get to the hotel. It took me some minutes to figure out the streets and find the route to the hotel.) The station is served by the Central line, which offers good access to almost all other tube lines. The hotel is less than two miles from the Paddington station, so if you are arriving on the Heathrow Express, it is only a short cab ride from the station to the hotel.Next to the Shepherds Bush station is Westfield London, which is a huge, brand new shopping center. It provides excellent shopping opportunities, and there is also an excellent super market which has a good selection of ready-made meals to take to your hotel room.My only complaint in this hotel is the lack of available power sockets on the working desk area. Unless you unplug the desk light or the alarm clock, there are no power sockets available for all gadgets. This is a typical problem for all the hotels built before the emergence of laptops, cell phones and so forth. Not a major problem, but when you need to charge your phone, laptop and camera all at the same time, there is some organizing to do.All in all, I really liked this hotel. Im pretty sure to return here next time Ill be in London. Ill be happy to recommend this to other travelers, too!"
90,802,"Apr 1 2009 	fantastic	My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Kennsington after being in England and France for two weeks. We try to stay in London for a few days on our way back to Canada. We will be staying here again on our next trip. From the minute we walked to the door we feltwelcomed. Our room was so comfortable and the fresh fruit waiting for us was a real treat. We had spent all day travelling. Breakfast in the morning was the best I had ever had. The best Omlette ever and the coffee was great. Being from Canada, We love our Tim Hortons. Bed was so Comphy, slept like I was at home. We were over looking the front of hotel and was nice and quiet. Staff was great and very helpful. Can't wait to go back. I know what I am getting for Christmas again this year. Oh, by the way a great door man, you are going to love him."
91,802,"Mar 27 2009 	Clean and comfortable stay at the Hilton Kensington	We stayed at the Hilton Kensington for 3 nights as a base for a London city break. We travelled to the hotel using the Underground, with the nearest stop being Shepherds Bush just a short walk away. Check in was fast and efficient, the room was small (typical in London) but clean and had recently been refurbished. We had a king size bed, flat screen TV, internet access (charged locally), bath with shower and nice views of the park opposite. We didn't pay for breakfast as it was overpriced but walked over to the Westfield excellent Shopping Centre each morning for food. Only fault with the room was it was quite difficult to sleep with the mini bar buzzing and strange sound of high powered water going on and off all night....after walking around London though it became less and less difficult to sleep!"
92,802,Mar 24 2009 	Great hotel great location!	We stayed at this hotel for two nights in February 2009 and were really impressed by it. The location is more Holland Park than Kensington so is also handy for Notting Hill and the hotel was less than a 10 minute walk from Holland Park underground. It's a beautiful part of London and I would love to have had longer there. Our room was lovely with tea and coffee facilities and a really comfortable bed and the breakfast buffet was immense with a wide range of options. The room wasn't cheap but it was very luxurious so worth it for a nice weekend away.
93,802,"Mar 22 2009 	Fantastic! Great room and location!	Me and my Fiance booked to stay in the Hilton for 2 nights in March. We didnt pay full price for the room, as Hilton were doing an offer on staying in their hotels over the weekend. We paid about 120 for two nights for two people.The hotel is situated in between Kensington and Shepards Bush and right across from the tube station and a MASSIVE indoor shopping centre, with lots of places to shop and eat-very up market!! If you stayed in the Kensington area on an evening there were some lovely places to eat, and some nice quiet pubs. We only ventured into Shepards Bush once-was not our scene at all, came across as been a bit rough during the day, full of young kids in hoodys....was a bit intimidated during the day nevermind the night.On arrival we were greeted by the door man who was very well spoken and polite.Our room was on the sixth floor, we booked a double room, and our bed was enormous. It was easy a kingsize, with lovely feather pillows and duvet! We had a fridge with everything in it-very highly priced and if you removed something to look at it you got charged whether or not you had it-told reception on check out and they removed it from the bill. The fridge also was warm?!! We had a big phillips plasma screen in our room, a spacious table and mirror, a kettle, with coffee tea sugar and biscuits everyday, a very good hair dryer, ironing board and iron, spacious wardrobe with shelves, lots of cupboard space, lamps. The bathroom was lovely, was very clean.The breakfast was fantastic, everything you could want, hot or cold food both available. Our breakfast was included in the price, but it was 20 each otherwise-bit steep!Was a great place to stop for two nights,would probably stay again, but I don't know if we would pay the full price of around 120 per night to stop there...Just one snag-the air con was broken when we were there, and was not blowing cold air out much. So our room was VERY hot-hotter than being abroad, and i found it very hard to sleep. But this was a technical fault that was being fixed when we checked out. Also, internet was 3 for 15 minutes!"
94,802,"Mar 12 2009 	certainly a 4 stars hotel with wounderful food and service	my wife,son and I stayed at this hotel in march 2008 and 2009, the room accomodated the 3 of us even though it was not very large. the room was impeccable and the bed very comfortable. the food is worderfull for breakfast and dinner. the meal plan is a bargain. the hotel staff is very helpfull and and very nice. the location is great since it is 5 minute walk from the subway (Holland Park station) or you can enjoy the 2 decker bus (94) which brings you downtown london in a pleasant way since it rides along marble arch and Kensington and Hyde Parks. Since the bus 94 runs 24 hours a day and it stops right in front of the hotel door, it is a very safe way to travel to and from downtown london even at night.In summary, great hotel at a reasonable price for Londopn, great staff , great food and great location which made our 2 trips to London a worderfull experience . WE recommend this hotel to anyone who does not need to stay in the center of the city"
95,802,"Mar 4 2009 	Great value for London	Stayed at this Hilton with my girlfriend in February 2008. We were in London for 3 nights and the Hilton group had a half-price sale on which equated to paying around 65 a night per room including breakfast. At the price we paid or with some level of discount I would definitely recommend the hotel. At full price, I wouldn't be averse to staying here but I think there are stronger contenders out there.The reviews of this hotel seemed to vary quite significantly so we were unsure what to expect. While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I found some of the conflicting reviews confusing, particularly on what appeared to be factual matters such as location and distance to the nearest tube station. I thought I'd try and clear this issue up, particularly for those not familiar with London. In essence you will need to define what you want from your trip. If you are looking to stay in London and don't mind taking a short tube or bus trip into the West End this hotel is fine. It is only just outside zone 1 on the tube which I consider to cover Central London. The central line from Shepherds Bush or Holland Park will take you directly into Oxford Circus or Tottenham Court Road which are about 5 or 6 stops away. The area felt safe at night and there were shops and pubs to cater for you in Shepherds Bush and Holland Park, even if neither area offers much for the tourist. If you are really into shopping, the location is unbeatable as the Westfield Centre is a short walk over the road and this includes all of the high street chains and lots of designer stores as well as a number of restaurants.However if you are looking to stay slap bang in the centre of London with tourist attractions in easy walking distance, this hotel will not suit you.If you are looking to stay in Kensington, it is also worth pointing out that the Hilton group's definition of Kensington is obviously broader than mine. This hotel is not in Kensington, it is on the border of Holland Park and Shepherds Bush. They should rename it to reflect this really. The hotel website also directs you to the hotel from Holland Park tube station which is about a 10 minute stroll along Holland Park Avenue. Although this is the most pleasant approach to the hotel, it isn't the nearest tube stop. This is Shepherds Bush which is just the other side of the roundabout. Some reviewers have said the nearest tube is a long way off. I'm not sure if Shepherds Bush was shut for renovation when the shopping centre was built, but this is not a fair comment any longer. To be any closer the hotel would have to be built above an underground station!The hotel itself is ok. It is very busy so be warned if this isn't your thing. There were large queues at breakfast on Saturday and Sunday, although I felt the staff managed the queues well, offering orange juice while we waited. They did also give us prior warning us of this at check-in and they offer guests a bribe of a glass of Bucks Fizz if you go to breakfast before 8am at the weekend. We went down around 9 and had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated which wasn't too bad. It is buffet service and it was well stocked at all times. The only minor irritant is that you have to wait for someone to come to your table so you can order tea and coffee. The sheer numbers meant that you were often waiting ages for someone to ask this or you had to take the initiative and find a staff member yourself. Quick suggestion Hilton: why don't you get the person showing you to the table to take the tea and coffee order at the same time?If you upgrade your room there is a separate breakfast room with no queues on any of the days as far as we could see.The bar was fine although a little pricey as you would expect from hotel bars. We had a standard room. It was quite small but it was perfectly reasonable and it was clean. The bathroom was small but the shower was good. Perhaps if you spend a lot of time in your room you might want to upgrade but it was ok for us.The only drawback for me was the heat. The temperature was fine in the communal areas downstairs but our room and the landing floor felt very warm. I guess this is a personal thing but we had to sleep with the window open and leave it open in the day to keep the temperature reasonable.We had a good experience at this hotel. For the price we paid, you would struggle to find anything of a similar standard in London especially inclusive of breakfast. The value was exceptional. That said at full price and if you were happy staying anywhere in London, you could probably take your pick of chain hotels and I'm yet to see anyone outdo the City Inn Westminster at that sort of budget."
96,802,"Mar 4 2009 	Actually very good - but ask for a good room!	After reading other reviews on here we were nervous about booking via lastminute.com on one of their Top Secret hotels (very easy to work out which hotel you will get by checking nearby restaurants!) and getting a very good price - 138 for two nights. This is a good price for London and we were 6 tube stops (18-20 mins) from Oxford Street and the centre of London attractions and sights. We asked for a refurbished room and a King Sized bed on check in and we got one! Our room was on the top floor, very modern and a good size for myself and my wife. I can only assume that other reviews have been for un-modernised rooms or single rooms - as ours was lovely. I travel a lot as part of my job and this room was a typical Hilton with everything you need in the room, a functional bathroom with shower, LCD TV and modern decoration. You could control the air conditioning in the room and we had an iron, ironing board, tea and coffee making and biscuits. You have to request a change of towels and bed sheets - as part of planet saving/cost saving measures - but when you do ask it gets done. Not an issue at all. We took the gamble on what we thought might have been a poor room - on the basis that we would simply be using it as a base while we explored London and the sights. We were, then, very pleasantly surprised. The staff at the hotel were helpful, welcoming but not imposing or in your face too often. We didn't eat or drink in the hotel as we wanted to explore, so cannot comment on this. The bar and restaurant all looked fine though and we never saw any queues for breakfast as we passed by the restaurant entrance each morning. The lifts worked and the internal decoration of the lobby and reception were all good. Location of the hotel was fine. Not within walking distance of any major attractions except for Westfield which is a new shopping centre - think you own indoor shopping centre and triple the size! It is very new and has all the major High Street shops. It also has a lot of bars and restauarants if you do not want to travel by tube to something a little different in the centre. Walking to the tube station (Shepherds Bush) took no more than 5 minutes - even lugging cases and you can see the Hilton sign as soon as you step out of the tube station. SB tube is also new and modern. I know that some of the other reviews are poor. However, our room was modern and clean. Everything worked perfectly and we needed to ask for nothing. As the phrase goes, if you don't ask you don't get - so be clear when you check in what type of room you would like. We had a very relaxing stay, we were happy to travel on the tube each day to see the sights (Zone 1&amp;2 day pass costs 5.60 per person) and did much more than we planned to in just 2nights/3days. Our advice, pay less for a slightly off centre hotel and you can spend the extra seeing the sights - we did this and got to do a lot more as a result. Hotel was excellent. But make sure you ask for a good room and be nice to reception staff when you check in.... ;-)"
97,802,"Mar 3 2009 	Great central location good hilton standard would recommend!	I stayed here with my partner in Jan 2009 as part of a overnight stay to london to go and see wicked (which was incredible) for our anniversary. We booked this hotel through last minute and were very pleased. The hotel is lovely inside with standard smart reception and a nice bar area with attentive staff. When we checked in we were told we had been put in a twin room, however the staff on reception were very good and changed our reservation to a king room (inside room) straight away. The room was of a good Hilton standard and the bed was very comfortable. The only issue I had was the shower was wall mounted and quite low. I'm only 5ft 6 but I did have to contort myself a little to get it to spray on my head Like some of the other reviewers had said, we paid 10 pp additionally for the breakfast but it was well worth it and despite our breakfast being on a sunday morning also, the breakfast manager was prompt and efficient.We used Notting Hill Gate Tube stop as our nearest one- I guess this Hilton does count as Kensington, although is not accessed from the two kensington (South Ken and High St Ken) tube stops if you are looking to be near to attractions by these......Despite that, its in a central zone, close to the tube and the room/breakfast/service was great. would recommend!"
98,802,"Mar 2 2009 	loved the hotel and staff were fab!	Stayed from the 27th february for 3 nights on a birthday celebration weekend. From the moment we arrived we experienced an extremely high level of customer service, from the concierge (Rachid - an amazing man!), the waiters, porters, reception staff(gosia) and colleagues. Nothing was too much trouble. We were upgraded to an executive room and found the executive lounge was perfect too. As it was my friends birthday, they surprised us with wine and fruit delivered to room and at dinner they brought out a cake and sang happy birthday! I have already recommended it to all my other friends and have booked to go back in may! excellent Hotel!"
99,802,"Mar 1 2009 	9 out of 10?	A few years ago we stayed in this Hotel courtesy of a special offer which included the famous Hilton buffet breakfast (where you basically eat until you burst at the seams!). I remember thinking disappointedly, that the Hotel had seen better days - indifferent personnel, tired rooms, bathrooms with cracked tiles and peeling plaster... I also remember I wasn't in a hurry to book another stay! The next few years I stayed away from the Hilton group mainly because of a distinct lack of reasonable deals that I could get much better elsewhere on the Internet. Then this year I needed to come to London for a few days in January and saw by chance, that the Hilton were doing a good weekend-only deal of approx. 65 per night including full brekkie. Great! Adjacent to Holland Pk. underground station on the central line, this Hotel was perfectly situated for my needs but after my previous experience, I was unsure whether to stay there again in spite of the cheap price. Sometimes I think it's better to pay a bit extra and get a bit of extra quality in return. I must say, I needn't have worried and was very pleasantly surprised. In the intervening years, this branch has obviously had a major make-over. The reception and 24hr bar were both new and smart. To one side of the bar were 4 PC's and for quieter preferences there was a separate computer booth a few yards away. I recall that the surfing rates were not even as extortionate as they usually are...I can't remember exactly but something like 3.00 for 30mins, anyway a lot cheaper than other hotels I've stayed in, that's for sure and OK for emergencies as I didn't notice any internet cafes nearby which is hardly surprising as Holland Park is undoubtedly an upmarket area. Even the bar seemed to have reasonable prices for both drinks and food (including the dessert menu for sweet tooths like me) and was packed out on the Saturday night. The rooms were newly re-furbished and although small-ish (the bed took up most of the room), were super-clean and modern with dark wood furnishings. The bathroom was also scrupulously clean. My only grumble was being shower-only, hence no bath, it was small-ish too and a bit more space to maneouvre would have been nice. However space abounded in the shower which took up one whole side of the wall with sliding glass door that completely sealed in the heat and moisture and was spotless - no cracked tiles, no rusting chrome fittings (my pet hate) - perfect! One of the best showers I've experienced! All done to a high-spec - all taps and fixtures etc were by Grohe, one of the best makes for bathrooms. Luxury toiletries by Evelyn &amp; Crabtree too. On to breakfast....well it consists of everything you could possibly want and more which spells disaster for your waistline! You name it, it's available. And you can have as much or as little as you want. I found that the Sunday was obviously very busy as EVERYBODY wants a leisurely Sunday breakfast, don't they? When we descended to the breakfast room there was a queue right out the door, however it went down surprisingly quick and you were not kept waiting long. This was largely due to the very efficient breakfast manager who kept a beady eye on his staff and didn't miss a thing, also finding time to be charming and attentive to the guests...something I hadn't seen at any Hilton (except the Hilton Glasgow Grosvenor) until now. Food was of a good, fresh standard with the added nice touch of an Omelette Chef who cooked your eggs to order at the moment. On a side note, some joker had obviously turned up the toasting machine way too high and soon the air was permeated with the smell of bread burnt to absolute cinders that people seemed to accept and eat anyway instead of turning the heat down! If something ran out, you only had to mention it and it was immediately replenished. There were free newspapers too although bizarrely, I was unable to find the TV page. For some reason there wasn't one which I found annoying. Nevertheless, I have to say I had a totally relaxing and pampered weekend - all the more so because it was totally unexpected. If you are looking for something more intimate and boutique then maybe this doesn't quite hit the mark but they succeeded in being much less corporate and more caring which is no small feat! The area is pretty spot-on too. It's a 5 minute walk from the Underground or several buses from the trendy Notting Hill area (about 1 mile away) stop right outside the Hotel which is hightly convenient. Plus I noticed some great tea-rooms inc. Patisserie Valerie (nobody does cakes and pastries better than the Brits!), an express-style Tesco's supermarket (although I prefer Sainsbury's), the obligatory Pub and a sprinkle of various funky shops and boutiques, all on the brief stretch of road from the Tube station towards the hotel which makes for a pleasant walk while window-shopping. I believe that going the opposite way ut of the hotel leads to a recently constructed shopping city called Westfield, however I didn't explore it further as I'm not a shopping mall kind of person, whatever the shops.So to the vote...I give this Hotel 9 out of 10. Why not 10 out of 10 you ask? Because perfection is nigh on impossible but when I stayed there, it came pretty close :-)"
100,802,"Feb 17 2009 	Excellent location for new shopping centre	A typcial 4 star Hilton with nothing out of the ordinary. Casual dining was busy but the restaurant was empty on a Tuesday night. A few things missing in the room, bottle opener, some toiletries but comfortable enough. Check-in was pleasant and efficient but I saw queues quite frequently. The gym is small but equipment was in good condiiton.The location for the Shepherds Bush overground and underground lines is excellent, just a couple of minutes walk. The hotel is virtually across the road from the new Westfield shoping centre which is excellent (De Beers, Tiffany, Dior, Prada as well as main high street stores)."
101,802,"Feb 11 2009 	Not the normal Hilton Standards I expect get a grip Hilton Kensington	The hotel is in Shepherd's Bush not Kensington, not that that mattered to me. Me and my partner decided to stay at this hotel as we got a last minute half price deal, as it was her birthday and the hotel had leisure facilities.First impressions of the hotel were very good not a bad location, nice reception and bar area very modern and clean. However there was a constant que at reception and for the concierge desk this regulalrly meant a 10 -15 minute wait. The staff were very friendly and trying hard, but clearly not enough of them.The room was clean, niclely decorated and furnished, although the room was tiny and without a bath !!Went to use the sauna and steam room early morning, three hours after it was due to open and neither were warm. Both were filthy dirty with large build ups of body fat. The poor lighting and steam must have covered up the filth very well. This clearly had not been cleaned properly for weeks if not months. I immediately raised this issue with the Manager who agreed it was filthy dirty and he stated it was meant to be cleaned daily but he could see this had not happend for some time. Also there was no jacuzzi or water facilities. The gym was small but nicley appointed with basic equipment.The Manager gave us an upgrade to the executive lounge for breakfast, glad he did after seeing a 100 plus que for the standard breakfast lounge.The executive lounge had two members of staff who were clearing tables and working very hard. We had to ask for side plates, glasses, milk and butter, not really acceptable for the Hilton.The full english was lacking, no beans, no hash browns and poor quality bacon all served just about warm !! If you just simply want a room to sleep the night it's probably ok if you don't mind queing and waiting a long time for a cold Breakfast !!If I paid the full price, I would feel like that I had been Robbed !!Previously stayed at the Holiday Inn Kensington which is far superior in every way."
102,802,"Feb 3 2009	cant understand negative reviews	stayed for 2 nights, got a brilliant online rate and stayed in a executive suite. First impressionof the room was a bit small for an executive but it had been recently refurbished and was very clean with a big flatscreen tv and nice decor it had a well stocked mini bar with iron + board and a decent hairdryer!!! when you go executive you get acces to the exec lounge which provides free drinks and food (6-8pm) also you get a free breakfast the lounge is open 24hrs a day where you can get tea/coffee/cold drinks, also there is an am/pm bar where they serve drinks and food i thought they could have done better with the decor and i found it quite expensive i found all the staff very helpful. if your thinking of staying at this hotel book online you will save a lot of money"
103,802,"Feb 2 2009 	smalles hotel room...	We booked a one night stay at the Hilton Kensington for end January. The room was one of the smallest ever, with the bathroom being equally minute. It was however nicely decorated and we were only using it as a base for sightseeing. The breakfast was excellent and inluded in our package price. The Hotel is not however near enough to Kensington, it is however perfectly placed for the new London shopping mall, which is only five minutes walk away."
104,802,"Feb 2 2009 	Average for a Hilton	We booked this hotel at the end on January 2009 with a good deal from Lastminute.com, which we were glad of because for a Hilton this is definitely of the lower-end, not up to standards of Hilton's I've stayed in before.Having said this, it wasn't bad, just not the high standards expected. It still beats a Travelodge etc etc and the price was good to reflect this. If I'd paid full price though I'd have been disappointed.Location is the otherside of a large island from the massive brand new shopping complex - Westfield - which for shoppers is heaven! Shepherds Bush tube and station are there too which are brand new so very convenient.The 148 bus stops directly outside the hotel also which for 2 is cheaper and more convenient that the tube to get to Park Lane / Marble Arch / Victoria etc.The standard rooms are fairly small, but do have everything you need and were clean. However the AirCon in our room was either not working or just basically rubbish, so our room was very hot and uncomfortable the first night, but we had the window open all day the 2nd day so it was cooler the following night.Breakfast was very nice, although as it was so busy you do have to queue to be seated, at one stage there was probably about 100 people in the queue (luckily we'd got there just before the large group)All in all this hotel is fine if you get it cheap, but full price it's not worth it there are better hotels."
105,802,"Jan 30 2009 	Not a business hotel and poor Hilton standards	The hotel is not somewhere I'd recommend to anyone, particularly business travellers. The building is in desperate need of renovation, which they happened to be doing in the hallways while I was staying there. As a result, there was dust everywhere, the lifts broke, and we were forced to take the stairs. The room was clean enough, but tiny - the smallest I've seen in London. The bathroom was ridiculously small with broken fittings, and I could hardly fit in the shower. I was shocked to find the hotel only offered wired internet access, despite promoting wifi. Wifi is only available in the lobby, and I'm hardly going to hold a webconference there. The ethernet cable was about 30cm long, which didn't allow me to move my laptop at all around the bedroom. Paying 15 GBP daily for wired internet seems excessive and rather outdated. I'd happily pay that amount for wireless.I've stayed in 3 star hotels that are much nicer than this, and even some 2-stars that are nicer. This does not deserve 4-star status.It was particularly frustrating that when the hotel staff asked my opinion of the hotel at checkout, and I replied honestly that I was decidedly unimpressed, they barely acknowledged my response and didn't offer an apology.I won't stay there again and will ask my company to take them off their preferred hotel list."
106,802,"Jan 27 2009 	Should be Hilton Shepherd's Bush	Hotel is not in Kensington, it's next to Shepherd's Bush train station. Still very convenient for the tube though. Hotel service was disappointing the front desk initially refused to give us our breakfast despite the booking form stating breakfast was included three times. Eventually had to ask for the manager to resolve this.Bar was disappointing with all the draught beers not available one night.Room was small but fine and very clean."
107,802,"Jan 26 2009	OK but not central	The Kensington Hilton is a nondescript building situated at the very edge of central London. The Kensington and the Notting Hill districts are within walking distance, but anything else requires a trip by taxi, tube, or bus into the city center, which can take anything from 15 to 30 minutes. This has to be factor for those who are staying in London as tourists.However the hotel is significantly cheaper than most hotels nearer the center. I found the reception staff courteous and helpful. The public areas are spacious and pleasant, with a discreetly contemporary design. My room was small with rather drab furnishings and carpeting. The bathroom was quite ordinary but clean. All quite OK, but nothing special. I did not use the restuarant.Internet connections are available in the room but at a scandalously high charge. This is typical for most British hotels -- the Brits seem to regard the internet as a precious resource akin to gold or platinum, to be rationed carefully and expensively at all times. (Don't even THINK about using the internet facilties at London airports!) Worse, the Hilton's internet service has a puritanical cyber nanny that blocks huge numbers of websites as being too naughty for guests. I discovered this when it blocked an art gallery website because the word &quot;nude&quot; appeared on the site. Out of curiousity I tried a few other sites with clinical words like &quot;scrotum&quot; and &quot;circumcision&quot; and those got blocked too. What makes this tyranny all the more bizarre is that the hotel provides pornography channels on the room TV, so guests can wallow in depravity in one medium but not the other. Go figure.Transport into central London is straightforward -- a straight run from Holland Park Ave to Oxford Street. The bus is slowest but provides the best views over Hyde Park and other sights if you sit upstairs. Taxis are expensive. The tube has a fiendishly complicated fare structure, because unlike virtually every other urban mass transit system in the world, it charges by distance rather than a flat rate. To save yourself the hassle, buy an Oyster Card at the tube station -- this calculates the price automatically and saves you money too.Tourist tips: A double decker round-London sightseeing bus picks up passengers opposite the hotel -- this is an excellent way for visitors to get an overview of this wonderful city. And take a walk to nearby Holland Park. This lovely park was originally a country estate and is full of charm and surprises -- well worth a visit!"
108,802,Jan 14 2009	Good	I booked this hotel at a discount rate as they were doing refurbishment works in the reception area so my review is probably skewed by the fact that the price was good (and I was on a high floor away from the noise). The room was surprisingly spacious. Only problems with room:Bed uncomfortable (ask for twin not double);Room not well cleaned after last occupant (but subsequent cleaning was good);Thermostat not very sensitive.Otherwise all the staff I spoke to were helpful and friendly. I promptly got a replacement extra fridge when I asked for it as the mini-bar fridge is computerised so you can't rearrange it. Also for those who are not familiar with London the hotel is located very near Sheperd's Bush underground and the new (huge) Westfield shopping centre. Holland Park tube is further away and you need to walk through Holland Park or catch a bus for High Street Kensington. It would probably be better to rename it Hilton Westfield or Sheperd's Bush.
109,802,"Jan 13 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	We booked the Hilton Kensington at short notice and received a very favourable nightly rate. We assumed the accommodation would be bog standard and our expectations were not particularly high. On arrival, we were impressed at the facilities in the hotel, a nice bar and restaurant, a large reception area, shop, and a gym. Check in was straightforward and quick. The room itself was situated on the 7th floor. It was expansive and beautifully decorated. It was also very clean. The staff were very friendly and you were greeted with at least 4 &quot;hellos&quot; on route from your room to the front door. The service at breakfast was excellent and the buffet was well stocked. It didn't affect us, but some of the late risers had to wait a while for a table. The hotel is handy for Shepherd's Bush tube station - definitely the closest one. There is also a large shopping centre just across the road. If you're looking for the nearest shops and eateries - again, head past Shepherd's Bush tube station and you'll find shops and restaurants."
110,802,Jan 6 2009 	This is a Hilton?	The hotel is an uphill 4-5 block walk to the nearest tube station which is not what is advertised. The hotel can be noisy as it is located at an intersection. It was clean but needs some renovations.The restuarant prices were absurd...even for London. I would not stay here again as it was not worth the $200/ night. I think a B&amp;B would be better for our next trip.
111,802,"Dec 30 2008 	business minded below Hilton standard	We stayed for 2 nights while at conference in London, our second visit for same purpose. Our room was very small, and only had a shower and no bath. Very disapointing for a Hilton hotel. It was however very clean and comfortable. We had dinner included on the first night, small portions but ok, nothing special. Whole place seems to revolve more round business clientele, and certainly would not recommend for a couple break for instance. It's also a long walk (relatively) from nearest tube, especially if it's raining."
112,802,"Dec 27 2008 	Kensington Hilton: Just OK	Stayed here for over a week over the 2008 Christmas period. As a Hilton Gold Member, I opted for the free internet service rather than the breakfast. Paying 15 for non WiFi internet for 24 hours would have been too galling and I'm always too tired to get up to stand in the long breakfast lines.Anyway, the hotel is located right next to the new Westfield Mall at Sheperd's Bush, just one hundred yards away. Great for shopping and several restaurants under cover. Head in the opposite direction for a ten minute walk and you're in Notting Hill and the edge of Hyde Park (good for power walking) or 2 minutes away to Holland Park itself and the upmarket neighborhood which surrounds it.This Hilton has a modern feel, with plenty of room in the lobby and a bar/restaurant open all hours. The lifts/elevators made a dreadful racket as you're going up and down, so I've taken to vigorously crossing myself each time I come and go to my room.Speaking of tiny spaces: that's what the rooms are like (on the 3rd floor at least). Once the queensize bed has been thrown in there's not much room for anything else except a de minimis desk and chest of drawers. The bathroom is relatively tight as well. Sadly no U.S. plug transformers as in other Hiltons (but the concierge tossed me one when I asked) and not enough electrical connections in general. It's all well decorated but the mattress was so soft I thought it was a water bed at first.The gym, too, is smallish with a TV for entertainment, a couple of treadmills, an elliptical and a few other machines, but it's adequate. Unfortunately it's underground so no windows and to get in you have to go to the concierge each time for a key.A nice touch are the free newspapers (FT, London Times, USA Today) at the entrance, and the presence of a sundries store in the lobby which is remarkably well stocked (but no shoelaces !). There are a couple of concierges, but one was very rude to my super-polite wife when she asked a question , referring to her as &quot;Your Majesty&quot;. Stupid and unecessary.Paid about 100 a night on average + 14% in taxes, which was about right. Would I go back ? Probably not because the area is not too interesting (except for the mall)."
113,802,"Dec 26 2008 	poorly situated 	The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, and far from the tube or any attractions. The rooms are dull, and placing 3 rotten apples addressed to someone else (seriously!) in a bowl doesn't really liven them up. The restaurant is mediocre and hugely overpriced,But the worst thing about this hotel is the staff. It would be charitable to call them rude and incompetent. Example: One day my key stopped working. Rather than accompany me to my room, where my passport would have confirmed that it was my room, the staff found it easier to imagine all kinds of nefarious scenarios explaining why I would want to break in to my own room.Probably the worst experience I've ever had."
114,802,"Dec 17 2008 	Can you spell srvice? Neither can they.	It really wasn't terrible, but it was close. The location was fine (at least for my nearby business meetings), but as the cabbie pointed out, it is not in Kensington. The room was clean and comfortable, though a bit noisy. The only real problem there was that even with the heat off and the window open it was impossible to keep the temperature at a reasonably cool level.The real problem, though, was the service. Beginning with check-in, extending through the breakfast buffet, the lobby bar and housekeeping, and ending with check-out *every*thing was incredibly slow. In both bar &amp; restaurant, the problem was not staffing level, but staff assignments. There were a large number of &quot;suits&quot; busily supervising a very small number of actual workers. And even the supervision seemed to be entirely oblivious to waiting customers. I sat in the bar for almost 15 minutes before being noticed and watched at least one other party give up and leave. Getting coffee *with* (as opposed to after) breakfast proved to be beyond their capabilities. And if you do end up here for breakfast, just skip the omelettes. The omelette cook is also responsible for replenishing the rest of the breakfast buffet, leaving the omelettes to dry out (or worse).Normal housekeeping service was fine, but a special request (&quot;We'll be right up, sir!&quot;) took 45 minutes and a follow-up call.Slow service at check-in and check-out seemed to be a matter of competence rather than staffing. One particular clerk seemed to be responsible for all of the delay action. Unfortunately, he was the senior person and assigned to the HHonors desk."
115,802,"Dec 14 2008 	An excellent base from which to see London	I took my wife away overnight to London to see a show and stayed at the Kensington Hilton. It was really convenient as the Oxford Tube (bus) stopped right outside and collected us again the next day. Initially I was a little apprehensive as the hotel looks like a 1970s monstrosity, however, on entering I was pleasantly surprised. It became a really spacious, clean and welcoming hotel with excellent staff (especially Rashid the concierge who helped with bus routes and directions etc etc). Our room was an executive room (6035) which was really nice if a little small with tea/coffee making facilities, flatscreen TV with freeview, safe, internet connection, en-suite, mini bar etc etc. Ice making facility in corridor for the provided ice bucket (Hint - take own champagne). My wife curiously removed an item from the fridge before returning it and although it is automated we were not charged (as previous review). The room was not ready as we arrived early but our luggage was stored with the concierge until we returned. We had access to the executive lounge and breakfast included. The breakfast was lovely with lots of choice. I ate this morning at 0900hrs and it is now 2000hrs and I am still full. We did not eat here during the evening so cannot comment other than to say the room service menu looked a little extortionate. Our sleep was interrupted by morons messing about in the corridor and adjoining rooms all night following a Christmas party on the ground floor but apart from this we had a really good time for just 99 per night which was very reasonable for what we got (this was one of their deals). Just over the road was the new Westfield shopping centre which was great for Christmas shopping but not for my credit card. We will definately be returning as it was an excellent base from which to see London using the 3.50 all day bus rover type ticket. It is best to arrive by public transport as parking was 37 overnight and the hotel is within the congestion charge area. Look out for deals to make this a superb visit to London."
116,802,"Dec 14 2008 	Had a wonderful time	Had a brilliant weekend with friends. Hotel in a great location, good transport connections from this area to central London. Lovely room with every facility - great choice at breakfast and enjoyed a very nice evening meal on the first night. Booked afternoon tea at the Ritz on the second night and it was absolutely gorgeous, would highly recommed it as a special treat. Fantastic shopping centre just opened - opposite the Hotel - amazing selection of shops. All staff very helpful especially the consierge - oh and if anyone finds a silver diamond and pearl earring anywhere in the hotel - its mine ! Thanks."
117,802,"Dec 12 2008 	Good Enough For Us	We arrived early in the morning (about 9am) and was granted an early check in by the hotel receptionist.Check in was a breeze and service was average.We were given a room on the 1st floor facing the main road. Room size was reasonable for the price we paid in our opinion. Tea and coffee facilites together with some butter shortbread biscuits are provided FOC in the hotel room. Toiletries were also provided in the reasonably clean bathroom. Room heater took some time to heat up the room though. Basic tv channels including a thai channel and a (i'm guessing) Dubai channel was available.Hotel was situated about 10 mins walk away from the tube. Along the way there were some cafes and a tesco which we bought our H2O from.Alternatively, the concierge told us that if we took a bus (can't rem the number) from the bus stop infront of the hotel, it would take us to Picadilly Circus. Tried it and it costs 2 pounds per person. Better off getting the day pass from the tube for 5+ pounds for unlimited number of trips within zone 1-2.The area surrounding Hilton was very safe as we noticed plenty of upmarket cars parked along the streets. There were also police vehicles patrolling the streets around 6+ pm.Overall, a value for money hotel that we would gladly stay at again during our next trip!"
118,802,"Dec 8 2008	Great for sightseeing	I've just returned from a weekend break with friends and found this hotel to be ideal for our needs. We arrived around 1pm and were in our rooms within 15 minutes of arriving. Our room (a twin overlooking the street) was spotless, if a little small, but we were only using it to sleep so size wasn't really an issue. The bathroom was quite spacious and there were complimentary toiletries and a hairdryer. The beds were really comfortable - I suffer from back problems and I slept like a baby in this one!Breakfast was included in the rate (which was booked through work so I got a really great deal) and was enough to keep us going all day. The staff were really friendly, especially the concierge who was most helpful with directions etc. It's close to the tube station and handy for all the sights and shops.I've read mixed reviews about this hotel but I would not hesitate to recommend it for a short break. We had a great time and can't wait to go back in the spring."
119,802,Nov 30 2008 	Great Stay!	My 8 year old niece and I stayed at this hotel Nov 22-29. The room was clean and very comfortable. The staff was friendly and took the extra step with my niece. When we checked in the reception clerk spoke to my niece and made her feel welcome too since this was her first trip to London. They also were quick to answer any questions we had about the local area. It was about a 10 minute walk to the tube station. There were a lot of shops and places to eat. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to London and would stay here again. Good job!
120,802,"Nov 30 2008 	Worst hotel I have ever stayed in!!	I have stayed in hundreds of hotels over the years all over the country mainly through work. This was possibly the worst I have ever stayed in.The rooms were well furnished and comfortable but very small. This was the only positive point!The a la carte menu on Friday night was just horrendous. We spoke to many people on the same night and they all thought exactly the same.The food was the worst I have ever experienced. It was buffet style for the main course. It was cold, dried out and tasteless! Absolutely disgusting! We hardly ate any of it.The breakfast the following morning was just as bad, luke warm at best and we had to wait 10 minutes for plates!!The service from the staff was dreadful too. I asked two people for a tea and coffee, waited 10 minutes and it had still not arrived so had to ask for a third time.One couple we spoke to that had arrived on Friday night found blood in their sink and toilet. The room had not been cleaned prior to their arrival.There also appeared to be a lot of people complaining about items going missing. A Nintendo DS and mobile phone for example.Also, the cost - 5 pounds for a bottle of water! 9 pounds for the cheapest glass of wine. 33 pounds for a steak - GET REAL!!Oh, and if you move any item in your mini bar, even if you dont take it out and use it - You will be charged!!"
121,802,"Nov 27 2008 	Nice hotel	For 80 gbp it was quite good value for a double with breakfast, and breakfasts in Hilton are excellent. From outside it doesn't look so great, but rooms are nice and it's clean."
122,802,"Nov 25 2008 	value for money if below 100 GBP/night	If you get a special rate or some deal which allows you to book this hotel below 100 pounds/night, then go. If it's more expensive - choose another.The positive sides: spacious rooms, aqequate location (you can reach city center in 15-20 minutes), safe area, good breakfast.The negatives: dusty carpets, old furniture, mostly indian staff, which hardly speaks english. I felt myself very strange when trying to explain that I need semisweet wine, not dry. The waiter couldn't understand the word &quot;semisweet&quot; and kept asking me &quot;Sweets? You need some sweets, sir?&quot;.I'd recommend City Inn Westminster or any of Park Inns. They are of the same price but of a much higher quailty."
123,802,"Nov 24 2008	Friendly staff expensive internet	Hilton London Kensington is located between beautiful Notting Hill and the new Westfield Shopping Centre - a prime location in London. However it's a bit far to walk to the next tube station. The staff is very friendly, the rooms warm, cozy and up to Hilton standards. Internet is 15 GBP per day, which is way too much given that a mobile internet flatrate for your Laptop costs the same. Otherwise nothing to complain about!"
124,802,Nov 23 2008 	Value for money	Booked short break under a secret deal and got 2 nights room only for 2 at this deluxe hotel for 138. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Room was adequate for a short break.Only disappointment was a twin room and no doubles available. However staff did offer an upgrade to an executive suite at 50 per night.If traveling by tube get off at Shepards Bush as its nearer than Holland Park.Close by is t he new WESTFIELD shopping complex which at night is magnificent.
125,802,"Nov 20 2008	Pleasant stay	Since my friend frequently indulges me perks from his Diamond status with Hilton, he guilted me into this crazy quick 4 night stay in London where we stayed at a different Hilton property each night to maintain his status. O.K., he didn't really guilt me, I jumped at the chance, but 4 hotels in four nights? This was a nice hotel in a residential section on the border of Holland Park and Shepherd's Bush. It is a quick 5-8 minute walk from the Tube station and really quiet. The rooms are small, but adequate. The bedding was comfortable. There is a nice gym with some weight machines, dumbells and several aerobic machines in the basement. The concierge desk was quite helpful and arrangements were completed quickly. The entire staff smiled and were quite friendly. Overall, a good value."
126,802,"Nov 3 2008 	Top Location	Great location, only 10 mins to Oxford St, across the road from the largest Urban shopping centre in Europe. 5 minute walk to tube station.The Hotel and Staff were excellent."
127,802,"Oct 29 2008 	Holland Park handy base	The Hotel is in Holland Park, handy for the tube and a 15 minute walk to Kensington High Street.We arrived early and were able to check-in straight away. Room was small but comfortable - we were offered breakfast at 10 , rather than 19 .Had a drink in the bar and bit steep for a glass of champagne- 10 plus 10% service charge to put it on the tab.That aside , the staff were excellent , location excellent and very comfortable beds- see what people mean about doors banging but no big deal.Decent hotel."
128,802,Oct 28 2008 	Nice Stay	I saw this hotel on Hotukdeals website and snapped it up for 60 BB for two adults. For those of you who know London Hotels that is a steal!Parked outside London and got the tube to Holland Park and booked in early..i would not reccomend parking at the hotel as the price is steep and you must pay the congestion charge also.I was checked in although no rooms were ready (as i expected) but i did check in my luggage for FREE with the Conc'.Returned after a fantastic day in Camden Town and Covent Garden to pick up our Key Card and retire for the night.Room was clean and 'compact' (the size expected from London Hotels) - modern decor and nice big LCD at the foot of the bed to watch MOTD on.....perfect.Nice hot shower in the morning and a big breakfast (mine was included in my tariff but i would of baulked a bit at 20 a head!!).Checked out and skipped out feeling good!!Staff were friendly and helpful especially Georgina who answered every email enquiry before my visit within minutes.When the deal comes round again i will book into here for sure...
129,802,Oct 22 2008 	great location	We stayed for 4 nights in a room overlooking the street at the front of the hotel. It was smaller in size compared to Australian hotels but large compared to other London hotels. The room was very clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and very busy with the huge number of guests. The location of the hotel is great with tourist buses leaving across the road from the hotel entrance - (hop on hop off buses). The tube station is an easy walk from the hotel passing lots of shops on the way. Breakfast was buffet style very busy and hard to find a seat.
130,802,"Oct 16 2008 	Lovely Lovely lovely	I was staying at this hotel for 1 night with my sister. The hotel was well decorated, clean and with a welcoming atmosphere. We got into our room an hour and a half before check in and had a lovely stay. I would recomend this hotel to anyone."
131,802,"Oct 14 2008 	pleasant 1 week stay	we arrived at the hotel after an overnight flight and were able to check in to our room at 10:30 am. the room was on the executive level, 6th floor, and very clean and comfortable. our room was near the elevator so we did not notice the slamming door sounds as much as other reviewers. and the elevator is very quiet! since we are hilton diamond, we had access to the exec lounge for free breakfast, cocktails and snacks in the evening, and coffee, water, sodas throughout the day. the neighborhood is beautiful. holland park is nearby with the kyoto gardens, lots of children and moms, and dog walkers - a very pleasant park. between the hotel and the holland park tube station are some good neighborhood restaurants and shops. bus stop is right outside - we loved sitting upstairs right in front on the bus! all hotel staff were effecient and friendly. and the price was right at under 100 pounds per night booked on the hilton website!"
132,802,"Oct 14 2008 	loved it	Very nice hotel. We stayed there for eight nights in October 2008, and we have no complaints. Food was great, location was great--great public transportation near by, buses just outside, and the tube a five minute walk. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Before travelling I read some of the negative reviews--and I am very perplexed as to their nature. The rooms are fair size for London, and everything in the room worked just fine. Breakfast was great, huge selection. We had a dinner and breakfast package, and dinner is a nice selection of a three course meal-- I highly recommend it. You might hear at night people coming back into their rooms in the hallway--but it's very minor and the hotel is very quiet at night. In conclusion: don't let the negative reviews influence you, it's a great hotel in a very good location."
133,802,"Oct 5 2008 	great hotel	Stayed for 1 night at Kensington and found no problem at all. Arrived early morning and asked if I could leave my luggage while I went to conference and was able to check into my room. Room very clean and recently refurbished.Breakfast was excellent the next morning, plenty of choice and all fresh and very nice.Yes there was a bit of noise as people came back to their rooms in the evening but surely this is to be expected when staying in a London hotel!!"
134,802,"Oct 1 2008	Terrible Terrible Terrible	TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE....Hi.. Just did a 1 month tour of Southern Europe, then GB and Ireland, and at the end of the bus tour we were dumped in the Kensington Hilton! It was part of the tour package, so it wasnt our choice... all the places we stayed in during the tour were fine, they all had their ups and downs... BUT, but this place!! it looks lovely when you enter the foyer, and that is where the 'lovely' all ends... small, dirty, discusting substandard accomodation, and breakfast provided was not edible. We planned to meet English friends for breakfast one morning, but it was far too embarrasing to put them through it... so we eat out. I could go on, but if this is enough to warn people about booking here, it's enough. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE...."
135,802,"Sep 30 2008 	Hell At The Hilton Kensington	Ive never written a review in my life and have never had a reason to complain about services. I generally have empathy for people working within the hospitality industry as it gets hectic and difficult at times, but my recent hotel stay at the Hilton Kensington has been the worst hotel experience Ive ever had and need to express my frustrations in this review!Staff: The reception desk managers are incompetent, arrogant and wouldnt know what the word customer service meant if it slapped them in the face. Theyre NOT helpful at all! They do not make you feel welcomed or accommodated in any form. It appears to be a strenuous and difficult task to provide any level of service, so theyve chosen to stick with rude and inept!I would have been fine if the hotel facilities werent up to scratch and the staff were friendly as it makes all the difference to a tired traveler, but since the Hilton Kensington failed miserably in being friendly and professional, Ive decided to include the other issues with the hotel that I came acrossHotel Facilities:As for the hotel the rooms, theyre smaller than small and claustrophobic. Bathrooms smallest Ive ever seen, youve more room in the cupboard! Hotel looks aged and dated.Room service meals are extremely over priced and disgusting (spaghetti served with lettuce in the mince, with a side of mustard, mayonnaise and tomato sauce???????? Or a ?20 breakfast that is dismal and usually nothing available). Believe me take the time to walk five minutes up the road and buy some real food for  of the price. If youre staying for business dont intent to get much sleep, its noisy and doors slam constantly, and pack water for your epic journey to your room, usually with your bags as they dont carry them to your room either!House keeping clean the rooms differently each day some days they replace the products some days they dont, guess it depends how they feel on the day. I think youd have a better stay in 3 Star rather than the Horrible Hilton Kensington! The Oxford definition of Hospitality: The friendly and generous treatment of guests or strangers. The Hilton definition of Hospitality: Weve got your money now go up to your box and dont bother us!! Were busy being rude to new customers.I will never stay at another Hilton hotel as long as I live, I will recommend the hotel to be delisted from my company as a preferred hotel and at any given opportunity when I hear that someone is intending to stay in any Hilton hotel tell them of my experience!"
136,802,"Sep 23 2008 	Brilliant	This is a very good hotel in a very expensive city. Room service is as you would expect from a Hilton property.We have stayed here on a few occasions and would definitely stay again. There are 2 tube stations nearby, the closest being Shepherds Bush which is only the other side of the intersection. There's also a cinema and some restaurants locally too.It's always one of the cheaper Hilton hotels in London, so if you can get an Advance Purchase rate you will not find a better hotel in London for the price.Also I should mention that the management were very kind and accommodating to us when we couldn't travel due to a family bereavement. They comp'd us the 2 nights we had paid for on our next visit. Absolutely top class."
137,802,"Sep 23 2008 	Fantastic Stay	We had arranged to meet several friends at this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday - everything was great, all rooms were good, a wonderful range of breakfast items and we also had dinner in the Restaurant - we had a table of 12 and the restaurant staff were wonderful - they explained the contents of the menu, (many hotels the waiting staff have no idea what they are serving) They brought out my husbands birthday cake and all the restaurant staff along with 4 chefs came to our table to sing happy birthday. The staff certainly made our break very memorable. Will definately be staying here again."
138,802,"Sep 17 2008	Not For Me	Had two separate stays here on business and sampled many rooms. I had asked for a quiet room, and to be brutally honest, I don't think there are any in this hotel. Probably the loudest slamming doors ever along the seemingly endlessly long corridors. Some rooms refurbished - some not, some rooms are absolutely tiny with the smallest shower facilities I've seen in a hotel.Internet expensive (even in the lobby), good gym - no pool. Decent help yourself breakfast was included for me, but looked extremely expensive at nearly 20 if it was extra. You need to eat a lot of food for that.Although it's the Kensington Hilton, it's right next to the Shepherds Bush roundabout. The whole area will have a very different feel about it from November when a massive Shopping Centre opens (and the nearest tube station reopens as well).If you're using the bus to get into the West End, at least you can get a seat before all the other tourists get on at Notting Hill and Queensway- they'll have to stand."
139,802,"Sep 15 2008 	Fantastic holiday	I stayed at the hotel a few weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The room was spacious and the bed extremely comfortable. The main restaurant is expensive but the food is well worth the price.The only issue that we had was that the nearest tube station was closed for refurbishment, meaning that we had a 10-15 minute walk to the next station. Obviously this is not the fault of the hotel but it would have been beneficial to have been informed of this when checking in."
140,802,"Sep 11 2008 	Clean but musty	We choose this hotel because it was the only Hilton we could afford....at $300 per night. While it certainly doesn't compare to what you'd get for $300 in the U.S., it wasn't too bad. The room was recently refurbished, so it was clean, but there was a musty smell about the place. The worst part is the room doors aren't sound proof...they have a 1/2 inch gap between the door and floor, so anytime someone came or left, you could hear the door slam down the hall."
141,802,"Sep 10 2008 	Still a great place to stay	I used to virtually live here Monday to Friday a couple of years ago.Got used to the regulars in the old Exec lounge up on the top floor.This hotel has a nice friendly, homely feel but was always a bit worn out. Revisited after a year away and they have done a superb job with the room refurbishments!the Executive lounge has been relocated to the ground floor an although I miss the cosy 7th floor lounge it used to be a bit cramped.The new exec lounge is a definate success! Nice to still have windows and has a lovely feel to it when inside. Much better than the misake of the move of the Glasgow Hilton where they moved the lounge from a light and airy upstairs floor to a dungeon of a basement room - yuk.Will always look to stay at this hotel when visiting London. Avoid walking to Shepherds Bush late at night - always turn right out of the hotel and go up to Holland Park."
142,802,"Aug 28 2008	Workable hotel but you can do better	This hotel is located in a beautiful leafy neighborhood. A bit inconvenient to the Tube... Central line station is about 1/2 mile away... But it is a pleasant walk, and plenty of pubs and cafe on the way as needed.My room was extremely small, like a train compartment. Hard to turn around in the shower, etc. It was clean and had all the necessary amenities, so the size wasn't actually a big issue for me.Breakfast was an above average spread.I had some trouble with the front desk staff... Got back from work dinner late, and needed to make some travel arrangements for the next morning. Paid for internet kiosk connection, but none of the terminals were working. Front desk staff was quite surly about this... wouldn't let me use the concierge computer, for instance. I caught them lying about the fact that &quot;all internet was down&quot; at the hotel. I know it's kind of a minor thing, but I hate it when they just want you to get out of their hair... no attempt to solve your problem.On that basis, I don't think I'll be going back. Same price as other alternatives, which have better tube access, and better employees."
143,802,"Aug 23 2008 	Birthday Stay	This was the third time I had spent my birthday at this hotel, and I have to say we were very well looked after.I had emailed a week before arrival to request an early check in as I was arriving at midday and their check in time is 3pm. On arrival the extremely efficient front desk welcomed me back and stated that our room was ready and we could go straight up. Check in done in under 5 minutes, we were up in our room in no time. This time we were on the seventh floor - I have stayed here many times and the rooms on the top two floors are bigger - and this time did not disappoint. The room was large and spacious with an extremely comfortable bed and arm chair. Plenty of storage space and plenty of room to move about. On arriving in the room we found that the kettle did not work so housekeeping brought another within five minutes, and the safe had been jammed by the previous occupants, but again maintenance were on the case and had solved the problem in five minutes - this was indeed customer service at its best.We stayed for three nights in total and were very sad to leave as we had been extremely well looked after. It will not be long before we are back at the Hilton Kensington. I hughly recommend it!"
144,802,"Aug 13 2008 	Wonderful Surprise!	What a pleasant surprise. I've been to London several times for work and stayed a various 3 star or better hotels and I must say the Hilton Kensington is the nicest hotel I have stayed in London ever. The hotel is exterior is bland but the interior is very contemporary, spacious, clean and inviting. I had a double bed room and it was quite spacious for London. The bed was extremely comfortable, the furnishing were new, nice flat screen tv and very clean. The Kensington (Holland Park) neighborhood is so beautiful. I felt perfectly safe walking around alone during day and night. There are loads of shops, cafes and restaurants around. A very quaint european feel neighborhood (obviously very wealthy area). The staff was very helpful also. I truly loved this hotel. I stayed at the Hilton Euston and it is a complete dump compared to this hotel. Enjoy your stay."
145,802,Aug 7 2008 	Hilton sort your act out	When you arrive late to attend a meeting the next day with a colleague and have two seperate rooms booked you don't wish to hear &quot;you will have to share&quot;. We had paid 200 per night each for two nights. The intolerant front desk managed to find a disabled room for my colleague and I think I got a converted hospital theatre room. My head hit the wall while sitting on the bed tying my shoe lacesGood point was the bar chap who was very friendly and tought me how to swear in Hungarian. That sound you hear is my HHonours card going in the bin.
146,802,"Jul 16 2008 	A lovely time in London	While traveling back to the states I decided to take a three day tour of London and was very pleasantly surprised by the Kennsington Hilton and their staff. Meals at the hotel were fine, the contenential breakfast in the morning was a great start. I particularly enjoyed the modern decor complete with giant fishtanks that gave a calming International-Fen Shui effect to the environment. In addition, the conceirge was delightful and extremely helpful in giving me advice as to getting the most out of my short stay. Being close enough to the transit system, I was able to tour a variety of locations throughout the city. As well, I found it easy enough to attend an early evening showing of the play, Mama Mia, at the Prince of Wales Theater, followed by a light dinner at Aberdeen's Steakhouse, just up the street. On a lighter note, brisk walks through the Kennsington Palace environment were delightful enough. In addition, the surrounding shops and restaurants were filled with all sorts of housewares, fine china, and clothing. I was blessed with good weather and good health on this journey."
147,802,"Jul 5 2008 	Delightful	We just got back from a week at the Hilton Kensington and this place was everything we needed, at the best price. After reading the reviews and forums here, I asked for a refurbished room. They may all be refurbished by now, but I think the request made them pay a little more attention. We got a third-floor room overlooking Holland Park Avenue (just above the flags out front) and the little Royal Crescent Park. Holland Park tube stop was only a 6 minute walk when we rushed. By the end of the week (walking over most of London and Paris one day), we started catching the bus out front to the tube stop since we had the 7-day Oyster card, which covers both.We skipped the high-priced breakfast downstairs and bought pastries the night before at the Tesco market near the Holland Park tube station. We even had a couple of picnic lunches and one dinner from the Tesco store -- saving a ton of money. We also brought granola bars and pop tarts for my daughter. Coffee and teas were available in the room with a nice electric kettle.We splurged one night at Cyrano's up the street on the recommendation of the concierge. He called ahead a few minutes before we headed over, and they gave us a &quot;reserved&quot; booth. (I saw them refuse to sit some walk-in folks there, saying they were reserved.) It was a nice meal, french food. Try the Coq au Vin -- and definitely the desserts were a treat! Price was $39 for two of us.We also had a final splurge with lunch in the lounge area before heading for Heathrow. The pricey $13 cheeseburger was very big and very yummy for the kid. I had the salmon eggs Benedict and it was a bit of heaven at the end of a long week. It sure is a nice place to sit for a while. They have wireless for a fee there.We skipped the Internet because of the big charge. It was nice to have the safe for the laptop and other precious items.Only minor issue for us was getting our glasses and cups replaced with clean ones the first night. I lined them up at the sink area the next day to make the request obvious.Overall, I loved this place. It was bigger than I expected -- sort of like a New York hotel room. I had no big issues with noise or water, and was happy to have the A/C with hot days near 27 degrees C. I read here on the forums that we Americans always want big rooms with hot water and cool air. Yes, we are a bit spoiled. I just couldn't settle for the B&amp;B route with cramped rooms, no air, tiny bathroom and possibility of no hot water for a shower.I searched for four months to find a better/cheaper place without luck. We paid about $200, but other Hiltons were $400-500! Try this place. If you're on a budget, you'll like it. I would recommend to everyone. And ask the concierge desk for anything. They seemed so helpful with all of our requests."
148,802,"Jun 29 2008 	Better than expected	Ive just come back from 3 nights stay with my husband and friend. It was much better than I expected. It is in a nice area not too far from Holland Park tube station. Check in was easy and quick, we had a room with a view of the road but our friend had a side room looking out onto a drain pipe! The rooms we thought were OK, modern looking, clean with flat screen TV (our TV had a bit of a fussy picture but our friends TV had an worse picture) the bathroom is small, but functional  I think they could have cleaned the floor better but overall it did seem nice and clean. Breakfast was good they provided Soya milk which is very helpful for my husband. A few minutes after arriving in the room they came with complimentary apples. They also have apples on reception during the day which for us was a really nice touch. We had a room rate which included dinner on the first night which was very nice and it saved us having to go out again to find somewhere to eat. The only problems we experienced was the minibars are really loud, our friend had the same problem but we had to call receiption 3 times to get someone to come and turn it off we couldn't have slept with the noise (the bloke that turned our minibar off new about the noise problem which is just stupid to keep them in the rooms). The reception staff on check in must have programmed the key for 2 nights instead of the 3 which meant having to go back to reception tired at night to get the key reprogrammed. Our friends key also stopped working but he had to go back to the reception again as it still didnt work! (I think they programmed his key with our room number in error - not good service) They didnt apologise which was a shame but it didn't really course too much trouble and once the fridge was turned off that was fine. Overall the hotel is clean, in a good location and we had a pleasant stay. I think we would go back because of its location and it was a good hotel for what we paid."
149,802,"Jun 6 2008 	Not Impressed	We stayed in a standard room and were not impressed with the cost of breakfast or internet. 15 pounds per person for the continental breakfast which added up to $60 US for my husband and I. The internet cost for 30min is 8 pounds which equals $16 US. One of the elevators acted as if it was going to break at any moment. The hallways smelt moldy, and we could clearly see water damage on the carpet in the hallways. Our bathroom had a sour milk smell, and did not go away the whole week we were there. The Front Desk/Entrance decor is worn-out and unattractive. This hotel was obviously ripping off the tourists who stayed in a standard room and not an executive suite. Do not have a 4 star expectation if you come here."
150,802,"Jun 3 2008 	Decent Hotel in London	My husband and I stayed at the Hilton on 2 separate occasions while in London in May 2008. The hotel is located in Kensington (about a 5-10 minute walk from the Holland Park Tube). The area is very nice, safe, and quiet. The hotel is clean and operates efficiently, but the rooms are very small. During our first stay, we had a room on the 5th floor. Our room had a safe which was large enough to hold my laptop. When we returned to the HIlton for our second stay, we were given a room on the 3rd floor. This room was very, very tiny - barely enough room to walk around the bed (I couldn't even roll my luggage to the other side of the room because it was so cramped). The safe was also smaller and would not hold my laptop, so we asked to switch rooms. Our luggage was transferred to a room on the 5th floor the following day. Unfortunately, I only took pictures of our larger room on the 5th floor. Furthermore, the walls are very thin and I could hear every door that opened/shut on our floor. There were a few minor irritants - not replacing used cups/spoons when the room was cleaned. There were some positives to this hotel as well. As I said before, nice location outside of the center of London. The concierge was helpful with directions and providing umbrellas on our many rainy days. The staff were helpful and accomodating, never rude. Overall, I think this hotel is a good value for the price since London is such an expensive city."
151,802,"May 27 2008	Great weekend at Chelsea Flower show	Just had weekend in Kensington Hilton. It was great value and the breakfasts were great,staff were helpful and very pleasant. The dinner was typical hotel fare but because it was included our expectations were not high any way."
152,802,"May 14 2008 	Good Value	Good clean rooms (bit on the small side- but that's London), friendly helpfull staff and great breakfasts all in a handy location for sightseeing of London"
153,802,"Apr 30 2008 	Above average pleasant but not a home run	I'd give the Hilton Kensington a B-plus. The place didn't blow me away but it was well above adequate.My room was comfortable, clean, and bright, though definitely on the small side. No view worth mentioning, but on the plus side, the room was quiet (not overlooking a street, no traffic). No security chain on the door. Water pressure of the shower was a joke, you'll get barely more than a trickle; if you have the time, take baths instead. The tub is high off the floor, I didn't have a problem with it but older / handicapped people might. Fluffy towels are provided, but no bathrobe. I'd forgotten my razor and the Hilton cheerfully provided one free of charge. The room is outfitted with a hair dryer, iron and board, minibar (you can't use it for your own beverages because it's full, and removing anything triggers an automatic charge to your hotel bill), a generous safe that holds a 17-inch Powerbook, a flatscreen TV (fairly poor quality signal and set to the wrong aspect ratio, no way for guests to change it), radio alarm clock, two phones (one of which had an intolerable buzz on the line). No available outlets: I had to unplug a lamp to alternately charge my laptop and cell phone. Will hotels never learn? No paper(s) delivered to the room by default, but you can pick them up for free (the Times and the Financial Times, at least) in the lobby on your way out. Health club is free to guests but astoundingly small. Ice machines can be a long walk away (the hotel's footprint is huge), and they're slow and stingy with what they dispense, but at least they work.Internet is 15 British pounds A DAY, which comes close to blackmail. One day it didn't work for hours straight, I spent 20 minutes on three phone calls trying to get a refund (which was ultimately provided). Weirdly enough, cleaning staff took my pillow -- the one I bring on my trips -- and I had to raise hell to get it back. That took 24 hours, though. And the hotel shut the water off for seven hours one night, though this was announced in advance and they sent a couple of bottles of mineral water to my room when I requested it, no charge. The rooms have no wireless Internet so you have to use the Ethernet cable the hotel provides, but it's only about a foot and a half long so you have to sit at the desk to use your laptop -- no surfing in bed unless you bring your own cable (12-15 feet should do nicely).I'd seen reviews complaining about the distance to the tube station but I had no problems. Holland Park station is just down the road, an 8- or 9-minute walk. It then takes less than 15 minutes to get to places like Leicester Square, Covent Garden, and other central spots. A cab to Paddington Station (from where you can take a train to Heathrow airport) costs just under 10 pounds. Several doubledecker buses, including the one to Camden Town, stop right in front of the hotel.The Hilton lounge is pleasant though the serving staff didn't always excel in speed. I didn't try the on-premises restaurant -- looked at the menu and decided it seemed overpriced (most hotel restaurants are). There are lots of inviting lunch/dining options a short walk away, including Thai, Chinese, several Indians, a really good French pastry place, a couple of cafs, a Starbucks. All pretty affordable. A French-run wine store is nearby also. Pack a corkscrew!Holland Park Avenue has few shops worth a damn, but a good, well-stocked bookstore (Daunt) is five or six minutes from the Hilton, right on the main drag. (They did make me buy my own wrapping paper when I bought gift books for my kids -- one pound a sheet. Ouch.)Holland Park itself is three or four blocks away and it is as gorgeous as ever (go there after it's rained and revel in the great smells of the grass and the copious blooms). The Belvedere, right in Holland Park, is a very swanky-looking restaurant, beautiful grand interior, terrific ambience. The food was good, not great, but at 18 pounds for a three-course prix fixe lunch, I had no reason to complain -- on the contrary.For the right price, I'd stay at the Kensington Hilton again."
154,802,"Apr 26 2008 	As each time perfectstay	I've been to this hotel several times and, as usual, this Hilton is perfect. They've been through a programme of refurbishment (with 3million pounds!) and it was worth it. The rooms are clean and spacious, still offering free bottles of water (but not sure it's in every room since I'm Silver VIP in their HHonors programmes and they brought the bottles in the afternoon ...). The closest station, Shepherd's Bush (on the central line) is closed as they are re-building it, but if you come by the Eurostar, you can go to Shepherd's Bush Green (on the Hammersmith &amp; city line, direct from St Pancras, 30 minutes) and if you turn left when coming out of the station, walk 5 minutes, you will come to a bus stop. Take the C1 which will cross the roundabout, get off just after it, walk towards the left, stay on the same footpath and the Hilton is just 5 minutes walk from this bus stop. Otherwise, there are busses stopping in front of the hotel too, that's the 31 and his end station is at Shepherd's Bush. The stop is also just after the roundabout, right opposite the hotel (bus stop name: Royal Crescent). The 94 is also stopping just in front and will bring you to the city centre (but the congestion in London is still a real pain!)If you want a good plan for food, I recommend the &quot;Caf Rouge&quot;, a French brasserie - there are several branches in London, just check (--) and enjoy!"
155,802,"Apr 24 2008	Can not fault and stayed here many times - always impressed	Have stayed here many times as I have never had reason to fault. Always plenty staff on reception and they all smile. Have been upgraded every time stay here and even once to a suite! Breakfast is lovely with many options and area large enough for amount of guests. Dinner a little expensive but very nice and so is the chinene restraunt that the hotel has in its premises. Lovely area too, you get a bus outside the hotel that takes you to Oxford Street and Piccasilly in about 20 minutes and the service is very regular, nice areas to go for walks around Holland Park and if you have time walk up to Holland Park as there is lovely shops and restaurants. Bar is very clean and staff always there to help. An amazing hotel close to central london but far away enough to enjoy a nice area of London. My 1st choice hotel for staying in London and its highly recommended."
156,802,"Mar 30 2008 	great location great staff	The hotel is located in a nice neighborhood out of the congestion of London. The rooms are nicely appointed and very clean. We are gold Hilton Honors members and were able to upgrade to updated rooms on the executive level that were very nice. The Executive Lounge on the first floor offered a nice breakfast, as well as daily snacks and drinks. All the staff we encountered were excellent from the doormen, front desk staff, waitstaff, concierge, and housekeeping. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this hotel.There is a bus stop in front of the hotel with many bus routes for easy access to London. This is how we got around and found it to be very convenient. The Holland Park tube is just a few blocks away, if needed. There are some nice restaurants in the area. We especially enjoyed those on, or near Queensway (north of Hyde Park and a just a few bus stops away). If you love Indian food, don't miss Khans."
157,802,"Mar 30 2008 	We'll go again	Stayed 25th and 26th March at the Hilton Kensington - Its a bit of a hike from either of the nearest tube stations but there is work ongoing at the Shepherds Bush station which I think will be finished soon (and its about 50 yards away). But nil desperandum, the bus stop is across from the hotel and with an Oyster Card, trips are only 90p - and you see so much more!The hotel is really good, the concierges have so much local knowledge and the doorman I think is Chinese but, again, whatever you want to do, he has the answer.We stayed in the executive wing (deluxe rooms) - the rooms are fine and roomy and clean but it also gives you access to the exec lounge where you can get snacks and non-alcoholic drinks most of the day and then alcoholic drinks from 6 to 8PM in the evening.The bill had no errors, everyone was helpful and the breakfast was very good with plenty of choice (for all nationalities) albeit, no offence intended, interesting to watch two young japanese girls putting porridge onto their fried breakfast plate! But they seemed to enjoy it so hey!!Can't recommend the Hilton Kensington enough - we'll use it as a base for our next break."
158,802,Mar 20 2008 	Great Hotel and Location	I have stayed in many bad hotels during my earlier trips to London. This time I wanted to try something new. Hilton is a famous brand and has a high lowest standard. The Hilton Kensington doesnt disappoint you. The lobby is wide and very elegant. The room was not a disappoint either. It seems to be refurbished and it is a very nice room. You have high speed internet access in the room via cable and wireless in the lobby. The breakfast wa the best one I ever had. You dont need to eat lunch after that! I also like the location. It is close to Sheppards Busch station and Holland Park tube station. Since I was travelling to Oxford I found it great that the Oxford buss stops right outside the hotel. I will definitely stay here on my next trip.
159,802,"Mar 7 2008 	Excellent value in a great area of London	Stayed two nights in this hotel on business in March 2008. I was in an Executive room. The room as of a good quality standard and seemed to be recently renovated on the 7th floor. I was in the Executive lounge too and enjoyed the evening snacks and the a few drinks in the evening whilst watching the Champions League football on the flat screen TV's. There are also falt screen TVs in the main bar and lounge and there was a good atmosphere in the bar whilst the games were on.Breakfast was in the Executive Lounge and this was of a good standard on the ground floor. Regulars to the hotel told me this was a recently renovated lounge and used to be on the top floor of the hotel.The closest underground station was Holland Park, probably a 8-9 minute work from the hotel and this gives you an understanding of what a lovely area of London this hotel recides in.The service as exceptional and staff very friendly and focus on making your stay as good as possible. Really was top quality service."
160,802,"Mar 5 2008 	Basic Hilton Excellent Breakfast!	We stayed at this hotel for friday and saturday night in February, found the hotel easily from Holland Park tube station it is only 10min walk as Shepherds Bush tube is closed for a few months, the general area is very nice and safe.The room was standard double nothing spectacular, it was quite small and the bed was small too, bathroom smaller than previous hiltons we've stayed in but the shower was good. Breakfast was fantastic everything you could possibly want, very busy in the morning but the staff seem very organised so it runs smoothly. well worth having included in your room rate as I think it is 19.99 each if booked separately which is quite expensive."
161,802,"Feb 27 2008 	Pretty Location and huge breakfasts	Hotel was easy to find, straight off at Holland Park tube station and was a 5 min walk to the hotel past bars, boutiques, deli's and restaurants ...a really nice area to explore.Arrived at the hotel on the Friday evening and received a warm welcome and free room upgrade as we had booked through LondonTown.com ...for 3 nights for 2 people was only 306 inc breakfast, wich compared to other sites was a total bargain for the hotel.Breakfast was very generous, plenty to choose from, polite staff and very clean and organised.Room was a good size for a london hotel, good quality sheets and fresh towels. Only negative point were that the maids weren't great at topping up the teas/coffees, and also left dirty glasses in the room which had been brought up the night before from the bar ...nothing major at all though.Concierge were very helpful, we booked open top bus trips through them (which is a total must do for anyone visiting London)-however the ticket collectors on the buses offer half price tickets to other attractions so double check before buying the tickets from the hotel.All in all a really good hotel, although its a few stops away on the tube its a good excuse to get the open top buses and do some walking to properly see the sites."
162,802,"Feb 22 2008 	Pretty good generally	Generally we liked the hotel.The good bits:- In a nice area, about 10 mins walk from Holland Park tube station and only another 5-10 mins away from Notting Hill- Refurbished room nice, albeit small.- Staff generally pretty friendly and helpful.The bad bits:- Walls are paper thin.- Restaurant for breakfast is somewhat claustrophobic - no natural light and packed in.Apart from that, we thought it was fine, and excellent value for money."
163,802,"Feb 21 2008 	Convenient for BBC TV Centre	As a Sliver Hilton Honors member I had hoped for an upgrade, but it was not to be. However, the 5th floor room that we were allocated was clean and at the back of the hotel, so pretty quiet. The bathroom was very small, but clean and with a modern shower fitting. Crabtree &amp; Evelyn soap, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel, but no shower cap. The room itself was on the small side - but that's expected in London, and had a flat screen tv, double bed, arm chair and mini bar. There were 2 free bottles of mineral water, and a selection of coffee and teas (including herbal teas). Breakfast was a buffet, fresh fruit, pastries, cheese and full english. Quality was good and there were no queues. Very good fresh orange juice. Main consideration for us was proximity to the BBC Television centre. Hotel is a 10 minute walk from Holland Park underground station, but there is a bus stop almost opposite the underground, and the hotel is only 2 stops away. There are some restaurants and pubs near the tube station, which would give alternatives to dining in the hotel. Overall, not a bad hotel and reasonable value for London."
164,802,"Feb 20 2008 	Rooms were average but good service	I stayed here during a training course for work. The room was pretty average - small with fairly sterile decor, but it did the job. Wasn't impressed with the cost of internet access though. The service was good though - the staff were friendly and when asked to help they did, and not just pro-forma. The walls were very thin too - I was woken up on at least one occasion by someone in the next room packing."
165,802,"Feb 15 2008 	Average Business Hotel	This is a very average hotel. No doube this is below the normal Hilton standard. But for the price, its better than many London hotels I have stayed in. The hotel location has good access to the central line underground. However, it is a 10min walk to station. I caught a bus from the front to the station most days. The breakfast was amazing. But if your breakfast is not included in your room rate. It is a GBP19.99 per person charge. That is alot of money for breakfast!!!!! A traditional english breakfast from places outside the hotel would charge approx GDP5-6. I was given a rennovated room. Not sure when they rennovated it, maybe in the late 90s? I was given a room that was facing the back of the hotel which was nice and quiet. The bedroom was on a small side but was expected from European hotels. The shower was a joke, Im 6'3 tall (191cm) and my head would touch the ceiling when Im in the shower. There is also a sign in the bathroom saying, please do not overflow the shower as there is no drain in the bathroom. No drain in the bathroom??? Would I stay at the HIlton Kensington again? Maybe. Dispite all the annoyances, it was bareble and I have stayed at many worse hotels in London in the same price range."
166,802,"Feb 13 2008 	Character-less	A chain hotels sets your expectations at a certain level. For us it fullfilled the purpose: we just needed a nice place to stay. The room was very nice and clean but showed some effect of a long-term lack of cleaning, eventhough I think we had a refurbished rooms (as mentioned in a previous review).Another thing we didn't like was the noise which was a little much all during the night (thin walls, and from hallways). Strange enough in the lobby there was an advert for the executive floors, if you wanted calm and tranquility, which I found a bit strange if the 'normal' rooms aren't even up to a 'normal' standard. But not wanting to complain to much, there were definitely good things. The room was indeed comfortable and the staff were very friendly and efficient. The experience was a good one, but not a special one. The location was good as well, fairly close to the underground (although Shepard's Bush is shut for building works) and the area is nice and quiet.For a business guest it will most likely be a good option, but for tourists looking for a atmospheric experience i'd suggest not to go here, as it just a basic chain hotel."
167,802,"Feb 4 2008 	Book a room that has been refurbished!	I booked the Hilton Kensington for a 1 night stay as I was attending a work party in town. The hotel's got a nice location near Holland Park, and outside the hotel looks OK too. Well, it's typical Hilton (never look very cool or trendy but you can spot the same &quot;H&quot; sign everywhere in the world). The lobby area was OK, tidy and no complaints. I was upgraded to the Executive floor but my room was still very small and very old-fashioned (decor wise). However, the hotel is undergoing a refurb as most of the floor was sealed away. I'm assuming and hoping that the room decor will be updated and made modern. I had a good stay, nothing to complain or rave about. The rates at the hotel are quite good so after the refurb, I may return! The breakfast they provide at the Executive lounge was pretty good. I didn't visit the lounge in the evening so don't know about the canapes or cocktails."
168,802,"Feb 2 2008	Small but clean	If you like the Hilton chain, you will get what you expect, except the rooms are much smaller than in the US. My extended family and I stayed here and enjoyed the recently renovated rooms, and small, clean bathrooms. The restaurant is also decent, and there are nice areas to hang out with family. I would definitely stay here again."
169,802,"Feb 1 2008 	Great value quiet neighborhood tiny rooms	This hotel is located in the quiet residential area of Kensington (near Notting Hill). There are numerous pubs, shops, and restaurants in the area. It was sedate, but there was plenty to do.Directly outside the hotel door is a stop for the numerous double-decker bus tours; tickets can be purchased at the consierge desk. There is a tube station about 10-12 blocks away from the hotel. The rooms are quite small, but normal by European standards. We stayed in a &quot;regular&quot; Queen room and you could barerly walk between the edge of the bed and the wall. The television was hung on the wall in that space, so watch your head!The breakfast buffet was incredible and was included in our price. It included traditional English breakfast foods (sausage, beans, eggs, tomato, etc.), American treats, and international foods such as fish, deli meats, etc. The value was great.Internet is wired and quite expensive - about $20/day US. You can purchase pay-per-use cards from the front desk which allows you to use the internet from lobby computers. We arrived at 11am after a 10-hour flight and were given a room immediately at no additional cost - that's worth it's weight in gold!"
170,802,"Jan 29 2008	Not cold water	My stay was tainted by my estate agent booking me in for February 28th instead of January 28th. The hotel was full but they found me a room at 169 instead of the 115 I did have. This room had to be a smoking room on a floor that was being refurbed. My room had no cold water and so no flushing toilet, no cold water to clean teeth and so I had to have a boiling shower.The room smelt of smoke and the air con did nothing apart from keep me awake we the slashing light on the control.The clock was wrong on the radio.Room service brought me white wine instead of red wine for dinner."
171,802,"Jan 13 2008 	Your average 'chain' hotel - but stay here purely for the location!	This hotel is your average typical chain hotel - but I would recommend it as it is just completing a complete renovation so standards are higher than some you may stay in. Good quality beds / linen, bathroom / towels / toiletries and a good supply of tea / coffee in the room - as you would expect. Don't bother paying extra for a more expensive room (try requesting an upgrade if you are a HHonors card holder) because all you get is a bath robe and slippers! High points are the breakfasts and the bar - where service is quick and efficient and the standard of food and drinks is good (can't comment on the food served in the hotel restaurant). The hotel offers parking - underground car park run by NCP - so a bit pricey but your car is safe! Don't forget that this part of Holland Park is now within the congestion zone! Hotel is easy to find and easy to navigate your way out of! Best of all Holland Park tube station is a 5 minute walk (10 minute stroll) so you're straight into town with no line changes in minutes. Try exploring Holland Park Avenue on the way to the tube - lots of top notch groceries (and a Tesco open til 11pm), cafes, bars etc, a superb bookshop (Daunts), hair / nail salons etc so everything you need is on the doorstep! The only low point is that this hotel is heavily used by flight staff and rooms often aren't ready unitl 4/5pm as the flight staff are still asleep! Try to get a guarantee that your room will be ready when you need it or demand a more expensive room! It works!"
172,802,"Jan 7 2008 	Lovely hotel and really nice staff.......	Myself and my boyfriend stayed here over New Year's and we had a great time. We arrived from Ireland at around ten o clock in the morning, very tired and one of staff member who was really nice let us check in to our room which we were delighted about!The room was a bit cramped but we didn't mind as we had a lot of sight-seeing to do and we didn't intend on spending too much time there. We ate in the restaurant on New Year's Eve and it was absolutely delicious, very pricey but well worth it.The Tube station is just a five minute walk from the hotel and there is also a bus stop with a frequent service just across the road. Also Hyde Park is a 15 minute walk away and nearby to this is the Science Museum, which is just fantastic!London is the place to be for New Year's!!"
173,802,"Dec 22 2007 	Moldy bathroom	I went to London for shopping for 3 days. I chose this hotel as it's in Kensington and a Hilton. The first 2 nights, my husband and I were on the 5th floor, renovated and clean, but the beds were too narrow. So, for the third night, we asked for a room with a double bed. We were given Room # 1078. The walls and corners of the bath tub were covered with mold, the sink had black mold belt around it. I closed the bathroom door, but couldn't opened it from inside. The door looked like it had water damage. I called out my husband, he opened it from outside. I wondered what would have happened if I were alone! I reported the bathroom condition at the front desk, was told the room was one of the best rooms on the floor."
174,802,"Dec 5 2007 	A good night's rest	I visited London many times between 1960 and 1990 and stayed in mid-priced or budget accommodation fairly near the centre. Typically these so-called hotels were converted houses with rooms which were cramped, cheaply furnished and had limited en-suite bathrooms or perhaps only shared facilities. Although they were usually clean and served an adequate hot breakfast, my main complaint was the amount of noise from street traffic and frequently from other guests, which meant that it was very difficult to get a good nights sleep.On this 5-day trip, since my wife was with me, we decided to treat ourselves to something a little better. I was shocked at how prices had risen since my last visit some years ago; even the budget hotels were surprisingly expensive. In the end we settled for a 4-night deal at the Kensington Hilton with full English breakfast and two evening meals included for 488. We slept well with no night-time noise either from traffic or other guests. Our air-conditioned room was a good size, probably fairly recently decorated, but with a few signs of bad workmanship. Service and breakfast were excellent. The Table dHote dinner (included in our deal) was very good value for London, albeit the choices were limited. The A La Carte menu is much more extensive but be prepared to pay a lot more.The hotel is convenient for most people - out of the centre but easily reached by public transport. Returning from the theatre in the West End from Tottenham Court Road tube station via Shepherds Bush took less than 30 minutes door-to-door including a 5-minute wait for the train. A 3-day Travelcard is an economic way of getting around without the expense of taxis.I cant see why some of the other reviews are critical of this hotel  I guess some people are accustomed to much higher standards than us, maybe they were unlucky, or maybe theyre just a little bit picky. I have stayed in hotels of similar or better standard and paid a lot less  but not in London!!!"
175,802,"Nov 11 2007 	Do Not Stay At This Out Of The Way Boring Inefficient Hotel	I am a Hilton Diamond member and have stayed ay many hiltons/conrads around the world. When we stayed here we saw a mouse running across the bar area, lack of fruit in a simple glass of Pimms, the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing and a generally poor ill positioned second rate hotel. The excec upgrade rooms were like going to a low class bar and the upgrade was the difference between having a dirty wet table cloth on your table or a dry one. If you need to be staying on that side of town be somewhere else. Hilton as you would expect it this is not. Forget getting any decent food or for that matter a decent bottle of wine. Rooms are dated and hot with rubbish views. If the people before me have reviewed this as o.k then I can only presume that they have not stayed at a half decent hotel. I have only left such a poor review as it reflects the totally poor experience we encontered."
176,802,"Nov 11 2007 	Satisfying Stay	The other reviews for this hotel are very accurate. It is in an upscale neighbourhood between tube stops-- so it is not exactly in the &quot;hub&quot; of things, but if you want a nice hotel with good value for London, I think this is a good choice. We had the package with breakfasts and one dinner included. The breakfast room (also the dinner room) is very nicely done and both breakfast and dinner were very nice. Staff were friendly and helpful. We are walkers so we were able to walk to Kensington High street through Holland Park. It is about a 25 minute walk, through a beautiful neighbourhood and park.The rooms and bathrooms are nicely renovated. There is a flat screen TV, comfy bed, nice clean modern bathroom."
177,802,"Nov 5 2007 	Very good choice good value for the money	We stayed at the Hilton Kensington the weekend from November 1-4, booked two double rooms via Londontown.com.I sent a mail to the hotel before, that we would be glad about early check-in and that we celebrate a birthday there.Arriving at the hotel at 10.30 AM our original rooms were not ready, but we got two alternative rooms immediately. Check in staff was vewry friendly and efficient.Location:The hotel is located on Holland Park Avenue, about 10 minutes walking distance from Holland Park District Line Station. Not really centrally, but 3 bus lines with direct city access stop right in front of the door. So we loved the location, a nice upscale living area, close to Portobello Road and Notting Hill, lots of nice shops and restaurants closeby.Hotel:60's style from the outside and lobby needs some re-decoration. But all rooms are newly renovated. Size is average for London standards, bathrooms small. Beds are very comfortable and all bathroom amenities availablke, turndown service offered. we will definitively come back.Food:One dinner and all english breakfasts were included in our rate. Breakfast was delicious, all you can expect from English breakfast. Breakfast room is too small for the size of the hotel, but if you come early, there is always enough seating, otherwise you have to wait some minutes.Dinner was perfect, a 3 course meal, very good choices and excellent food.Extra:Coming back to our room we were very surprised when we found a bottle of champagne and two glasses in our room. Next to a letter from the General Manager, wishing us a happy celebration (referring to my mail I sent to the hotel). This was really a great experience and shows the spirit of the entire staff.Overall:If you look for central location or 5 star luxury, stay away.If you look for good service, nicely renovated (all non-smoking) rooms and good value for the money and you dont mind to take the bus to central location you will like this hotel."
178,802,"Nov 4 2007 	Excellent Choice	October 18, 2007 for five nights: After a rather disappointing eight night stay at the KK Hotel George in May 2007, based in part on what I determined to be overly positive reviews, I vowed to give the Hilton London Kensington a chance upon returning to London. The experience was very pleasing. I dont know if my stay was enhanced by my lowly status as a Hilton Honors Silver Member but the staff could not have been more accommodating. Though I didnt receive an immediate early check-in, after about an hour, I was provided a room that was ready with the provision I could change to my requested room after some rest. This was a blessing. No, this was a life-saver! The double was perfect. Flat screen TV, bathroom with tub/shower, chair, room to move about, nice size window that opens and a comfortable bed with a deep mattress. Other matters; the all important buffet breakfast, housekeeping, concierge, front desk, all truly exceptional and very surprising considering the size of the hotel. Indeed in every aspect, there was an efficiency that I had not expected. Though the setting is certainly a bit further out than most hotels, its only a short walk to the Holland Park tube station through a beautiful residential neighborhood. Tesco and other essentials at the tube station. Suppose the bottom line on the location is: if you can get around by tube, the location is a bonus if you like the benefits of a quieter residential location. With respect to the hotel and the amenities, I could not have been more pleased and will most definitely return."
179,802,"Oct 23 2007 	Good hotel good experience a little too far away!	We recently spent 2 nights pre-cruise at the Hilton, Kensington. We were able to get a group of 4 rooms on Priceline for $99 USD each per night! Check in was just fine, no problems, room was small, not as small we we thought it MIGHT be, we had enough room for luggage (we had a LOT) and to move about. Room was clean, yes it is an older hotel, there is some wear &amp; tear to be seen, but all in all, it was nice &amp; clean.We DID have washcloths provided! The one complaint I had is the 1 &amp; only electrical outlet I could get to!!! You needed a power strip to be able to plug things in. The bathroom counter space was very small and the lighting a little dim, but we managed. There was a safe in the room and the maid service was good.We did not eat in the hotel so cannot comment on that. The continental breakfast offered in the bar area looked pretty nice with a lot of selections. They only offered a buffet for breakfast in the dining room. The dinner menu looked decent.Location is on a very busy, beautiful tree-lined street with MANY restaurants within walking distance. The tube being about 4-5 blocks down. However, it is a 20 pound ($40 USD) cab ride to any of the &quot;main&quot; attractions!!! (ie: Buckingham, Westminster, The Eye) The tube is the best way and takes about 30 minutes with quite a bit of walking &amp; stair climbing!!If I was to &quot;do&quot; the main attractions as a first timer to London, I would not stay so far out, a hotel more centrally located might be more convenient &amp; time saving in terms of transportation. This is a GREAT location for those wishing to do more things within the same area."
180,802,"Oct 2 2007 	Second time at this hotel	For the second time this year, stayed at the Hilton Kensington. Again found it to be fantastic, and in a great area of London. Nice to get out of the hustle and bustle of London. Staff were lovely at reception and in the restaurants. The breakfasts are fabulous, every single thing you could ask for. I love their porridge!!The number 94 bus right across the street takes you right into town, and Oxford Street. I prefer the buses to the underground."
181,802,"Sep 21 2007 	Good Place to Stay!	We spent 6 nights at the Hilton Kensington and were very happy with our stay. We chose it based on value and the reviews we had read posted by others who had stayed there. It is located in a really nice area not far from the Holland Park Tube Station with a bus stop just outside the hotel door. (Buses 31, 94, and 148 all stop there.) We purchased tickets from the hotel concierge for the Original London Tour (Hop On/Hop Off) for $38 each. You can catch this tour right across the street from the hotel. If you book with Golden Tours, they will also pick you up at the hotel. We took the Windsor/Sonehenge /Bath Tour.(While they do pick you up at the hotel they DON'T return you - they will drop you off at some central point and you will have to find your own way back!The room was clean and the bed comfortable. Nice pillows! Our room was on the 1st floor and faced Holland Park and while we did hear some road traffic, it was not unbearable. WARNING: Don't open the mini bar if you don't want to pay top $ for the items inside...And don't use it to place any of your items in it. There are sensors that will charge you if you remove anything! Don't exchange your money at the hotel. While it was convenient, you get a lousy exhange rate. $2.25 per pound...There are money exhange sites all over and we saw some some as cheap as $2.07. We successfully used our debit card everywhere with the exception of the tube station where we had to use a credit card. We recommend you take along an extension cord and adapter if you have some equipment that you need to plug in. There were no outlets at the head of the bed and my husband uses a CPAP to sleep at night. We contacted housekeeping and they were there within 3 minutes with an extension cord that we plugged in under the desk and then placed his machine on a chair next to the bed so all was well. I was then able to use the same extension cord to plug in my curling iron. Look for the hair dryer in the desk drawer. You have to hold the button down the whole time so your hand gets a little tired but it works great. If the room had had a small refrigerator it would have been perfect but since it didn't we used a gallon size zip lock bag and put ice in it (there is an ice machine on each floor) and then placed the items we wanted to keep cool in it. Probably would have been good to have taken a small soft side thermal bag for that purpose. Since we found the price of breakfast in the hotel to be extravagant ($40 per person), we would go to the Tesco up the street each evening and buy rolls/yogurt and fresh fruit for the next morning. We used Hotelink to get from Gatwick to the hotel. We bought our tickets online and paid $50 per person but it was worth it because you are so tired after an all night flight and it is nice to have someone meet you, get you to the train and then from the train station, they put you on a mini bus and drive you to the door of your hotel. Coming home we booked Hotelink through the hotel concierge for our return ride to Gatwick for $40 per person. Be advised that rush hour on the subways can be treacherous. You are litterally jammed in. Since a one-way trip on the subway is $8 advise you get an oyster card or a travel card. We bought a 3 day travel card (Approx $33 each) that allowed us to ride the subway and/or the bus as much as we liked for that time period. If you are there on the weekend you must go the Portobello Market (located in the Knottinghill area but not a bad walk from the hotel) In addition to the antiques, the streets are filled with vendors selling fruits/vegetables/flowers/souveneirs etc. etc..."
182,802,"Sep 13 2007	Appalling soundproofing	We stayed two nights at this hotel on a deal and saw Ricky Gerais Live.The first night included dinner, which was fine, for what we paid.Rooms are small but adequate, comfy bed, nice flat screen tv.But on our second night,we had a group of tourists going in and out of their rooms, opposite and next door to us,for about two hours between eleven thirty and one thirty,the noise was from their doors slamming.I actually went into the corridor and complained and to be fair,they then shut their doors quietly.The doors to the rooms are self shutting fire doors,which if you dont shut ,bang.It sounds like the people are in your room.I mentioned this at reception and they said there is nothing we can do.I would not stay at this hotel again,purely because of noise from the corridors. This is a borderline four star hotel,although breakfast was very good."
183,802,"Sep 10 2007 	Fantastic	Having used this hotel before, i was ungraded on arrival to an executive room, which was very large and clean with full use of the free bar. I also for the first time used the Sauna / Steam room which i was unaware of before, they should tell you this when you check in. It is a mixed use, on arrival in the sauna i was greeted by 2 young girls or were totally naked, I have to say I was shocked at first, but they started a conversation so i felt at ease, they informed me that it is a normal in this hotel as it is a mixed area and they have yet to see people wear costumes, and they actually asked me to remove mine. Overall a great hotel with very friendly staff and facilities."
184,802,"Sep 2 2007 	Very Good Stay at the Hilton Kensington	We stayed here for 5 days during mid August. We booked a Disabled room and a twin room. The disabled room wasvery small and faced the lift area with an unusual open wardrobe. The shower is also very small if someone needs to use a wheelchair. This was on the 3rd floor. The other room turned out to be a King size bed which was a big improvement on the disabled room. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we found the breakfast selection to be very good and plentiful, with weekend breakfast until 11.30. We booked a deal with Dinner included for 2 nights and found the set menu slightly restricted, but it was good value for an extra 2 per night. It is definitely a good idea to book a Hilton Dinner Bed and Breakfast deal if you can. The only other drawback was noise from some over excited people who woke us up in the middle of the night twice, but the Reception staff soon quietened them down. All in all a very pleasant experience and if you want a hotel with bigger rooms,try the London Metropole which is slightly more expensive but also has a pool and shop which are useful. I would like to congratulate the staff at the Kensington Hilton who were mostly very kind and helpful to us and would recommend staying there to anyone who wants a short break in London at a fairly reasonable price."
185,802,"Aug 24 2007 	Nice Hotel Small rooms	Very nice hotel with helpful staff. Minutes from the Shephard's Bush tube stop was very nice for getting around. Only complaint was the rooms were very tight, and breakfast was not that good for the price. However, I definately recommend this hotel, it has a great staff and is easy to get around London from."
186,802,"Aug 21 2007	kensington hilton hotel holland park	A great hotel!! Staff was very helpful and polite. Room was small, but I suppose they all are. Very clean, the shower was the best ever. The water pressure was terrific; I have never seen a hotel with such a great shower.The neighbor is wonderful. Lots of great shops, pubs, grocery store. Walking at night was not a problem.We would definitely return."
187,802,"Aug 7 2007 	Substandard Hilton	We have just returned from a long weekend stay at the Hilton Kensington. Compared to other Hilton hotels I have stayed in, this is definitely not up to Hilton's usual high standards and as a result we wont be going back to this hotel again.First of all the rooms are no bigger than cruise ship cabins and the bath although it made us laugh was not even big enough for a child to comfortably have a bath, let alone an adult. The beds were really uncomfortable and the air conditioning seemed to blow out hot air - in fact our family who we were staying woke up with flu like symptoms.The idea of our trip was to watch a rugby match at Twickenham and upon returning after the match, we were made to feel distinctly unwelcome at the hotel, as we were dressed in rugby tops. The hotel bar staff questioned us on several occasions on whether we were a) guests of the hotel and b) whether we had swiped a credit card behind reception and then they took 35 minutes to make a drink claiming the bar was busy, which it was not. When we questioned the bar supervisor on this matter, he assured us that Hilton do not look at what people wear but this did not do much to allay our fears considering the poor service we had received.Luckily we spent most of the weekend sightseeing as I would not have wanted to spend any more time in this hotel than I had to."
188,802,"Aug 7 2007	Nice Hotel	The Kensington Hilton is in a great location in Holland Park. It is an upscale London Neighborhood instead of the braving the crowds in Central London. The rooms are very small, but clean and very quiet. You get your own kettle for tea, and they even give you cookies so you can enjoy a pick-me-up. I found the concierge very helpful. He recommended nearby pubs for food like the Crown (friendly service, good food) and the Miter a little further down the street (disorganized service, but there are tables outside where you can smoke). The only negative about the hotel (if I can call it one) is the scary prices for food because of the week dollar. Forty dollars for breakfast! $7.50 for a cup of coffee! I discovered a Tesco down the street where you can buy premade sandwiches and snacks. Once you learn that the 148 bus is your friend, you can go almost everywhere 24/7."
189,802,"Aug 6 2007 	Not Great but OK	The roome I had was updated even though it was small. The common areas need a good update, and the concierge staff look like they haven't seen a shower in days.... Would also recommend dry cleaning their suits more often. Rooms were clean quiet and air conditioning was adequate.... not sure it would have helped in a heat wave. Location is good and convenient."
190,802,"Aug 4 2007 	Great for a two night break	Having used this hotel several years ago, we were aware of its location, just slightly outside the main hotel areas. That for us was a bonus - there is a good bus service into the centre and the tube station is 5 minutes walk away and connects directly to Oxford Street and the theatre district. We found a really good Chinese restaurant - the Singapore - just up the road with a selection of pubs nearby, with prices half those in the rip-off centre of London. We had an good room overlooking the main road &amp; there was very little sound due to the excellent double glazing and the substantial trees, which seemed to soak up the sound. We found all the staff charming and pleasant, generally with a smile. Our room was smallish but very clean &amp; the bed was quite comfy. We had booked the two night break with dinner on the first night and breakfast each morning included. The rate that we got at 94.00 per night was outstanding for a London hotel of this calibre and Hilton Hotels should be congratulated for this offer, (which applies to most UK Hiltons). Dinner on the first night was ok - the food was well cooked &amp; ample, and the breakfasts were the usual Hilton buffet with every conceivable item for a breakfast available. The only criticism was that the dinner restaurant was soul-less, with some jazz music being played in the background, which sounded like a cat being strangled. There were very few takers for dinner and that didn't surprise me when the bill for extras arrived showing 3.35 for one cup of coffee! A carvery-type restaurant would be much more sensible and would get the punters in. This is an excellent hotel for a short break in London for those who want to avoid rip-off hotels offering poor value for money."
191,802,"Jul 23 2007	my week in London	I wanted to introduce my daughter to London and did not know what to expect from this hotel but was pleasantly surprised. Beds were very comfy, room so quiet we overslept, and had a hair dryer and ironing board in the room. It is convenient to the Holland park tube and any bus took us to the tube station with our daily pass. The neighborhood seemed safe and food was just down the street if we needed it. My complaint would be the cost of the &quot;extras&quot;...we avoided the hotel restaurants because of price. Internet was 3 pounds for 15 minutes or 5 pounds for 30 minutes! It was cheaper to go to an internet cafe for one pound an hour. We arrived at noon after no sleep at all on a flight from California and had to wait until 3 pm for our room. Possibly an earlier check in time would be nice for people coming across the world!! In all, we enjoyed this hotel. It is on only the central tube line so you have to change lines if you need any other line to get somewhere."
192,802,"Jul 23 2007 	Disappointed with Hilton	Given that the US dollar is pitiful in the United Kingdom and wasn't willing to spend $250/night for a bed bug ridden hotel room, I went looking for an esteemed, established brand hotel in London that was close to Central London for many obvious reasons. I stumbled on a good rate (for London) on Hilton's website and booked it without hesitation given my outstanding success with Hilton in the past. I was extremely disappointed with this hotel, however. Our room had a strong smell of stale smoke in it, half the bed was severely tilted so that when you laid on it, it felt as if you were going to fall off, our room was handicapped excessible which is fine except when your shower enclosure doesn't keep water in the shower like it's supposed to, some of the lights in the room didn't work, the concierge was extremely rude when we asked him to check on Wicked and Wimbledon tickets for us. The list goes on and on...London is about as expensive as it gets, but I wouldn't stay here again for $100/night. The one plus was that it was in a good location, close to Central line stations and Hyde Park (which is a beautiful setting for talking a walk or a jog). Find some other reputable brand hotel to stay at in London if you're looking to find a good deal. Don't stay here."
193,802,"Jul 20 2007	A Decent Value	With the exchange rate with the pound, Americans have to look for value. This hotel fits the bill. A place to stay that is not a dive. The hotel is very average and the rooms are consistent with European standards, i.e., very, very small. There is nothing about your room that is luxurious, but you did not pay for that luxury. A place that I would describe as a decent business hotel. Something that I found revealing was that Thai Airway pilots and flight attendants use the hotel for overnight stays. In my experience and observations, airlines book decent but not wonderful hotels.I do disagree about claims that the hotel was centrally located. The hotel area is off all the central London maps that I've seen. That is not to say that the location is inconvenient. By the tube, you can get to your location in a reasonable amount of time, however, you are not within walking distance of any of the &quot;sights.&quot; You realize the distance when you have to pay a taxi fare from the theater district to the hotel after seeing a play. I also disagree that the hotel is &quot;near&quot; a tube stop. The nearest is Holland Park, which is in zone two, not one. If you have luggage, it will take you eight to ten minutes to walk to the hotel."
194,802,"Jul 14 2007 	Good Value 4 Star	Very pleasant modern hotel with nice rooms. You won't be disappointed there. Beware of the mini bar which automatically charges you even if you simply remove a bottle to take a look! I complained and the charges were waived immediately. But these devices are very un-English and should be banned. I really hate them.Front facing rooms are cooler as they do not get the afternoon sun. However the AC is pretty good anyway.If you are coming from Heathrow, you can take the Heathrow Express to Paddington. A taxi from there will cost you 10 pounds.The HotelLink bus service is also good. Avoid the tube if you have a heavy suitcase because you will need to change lines. Overall, a positive experience."
195,802,"Jul 6 2007 	OK.... but that Loo	Pros: Good facilities, great breakfast, perfect central London location - close proximity to a tube station and right opposite a bus stop. And fantastic concierge service - very well informed, courteous and competent.Cons: Dirty toilet, even after we complained, and they 'cleaned' it, it was still an appalling state (see photo). Most cheaper B&amp;B in London offer free/complimentary room internet access, Hilton disappoints on this + no wifi :-(. Could the bathrooms be any smaller? water spills over in a shower and there is no drainage!"
196,802,"Jul 6 2007	Definately Recommended	The Hilton @ Kensington ticked all the boxes when we looked for a middle priced hotel with a good location for the attractions of london.Its a couple of hundred yards to the nearest tube station which made it really handy for getting around. The room was as expected. Good size, eqipped well and was clean and tidy. Booking in took a little longer than I would like but we obviously picked a busy time to arrive. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the stay.We booked one of Hiltons 2 night &quot;deals&quot; which are very competitive. I would recommend this hotel. Your stay should be comfy, pleasant and hassle free."
197,802,"Jul 4 2007 	A great place to stay on a budget	Although we visited this hotel a year ago, I finally am getting around to posting a review. My wife and I stayed at this hotel during the last week of August, 2006.This is a great little hotel in a very quiet area. All we needed was a quiet, clean and comfortable place to sleep as we were out and about all day, every day. Although the building itself is a bit old and non-descript on the outside, the interior was fully remodeled and modern. The room was quite large by European standards (see photos), and had a nice flat screen TV. The bathroom was solid... with great high quality soaps and shampoos. The staff was quite attentive and the concierge very helpful. The only issues with the hotel itself came down to cost - and not of the room itself which was quite reasonable, but the restaurants within. London is expensive, no doubt, but the Hotel greatly expands this. The breakfast buffet, for example, was high quality but cost $80 US for two people. We didn't eat at all other than the first breakfast in the hotel. Instead, we ate out at chippies or much of the time shopped at Tesco for things like sandwiches, etc. (There was no fridge in the room, so we had to eat right away.) The Tesco is a grocery store just down the street - a short 8-10 min walk - and had very reasonable prices even by US (Boston) standards.This hotel is very well located if you want a quiet place to stay on a very posh street in the Holland Park area of town. It is right next to the Notting Hill area as well. It is located between two tube stops, though the Holland Park stop is a bit further from the hotel (10 mins or less walk), it is the one we used because it was much nicer and closer to little shops and such. When we were lazy, we took the bus which stops directly in front of the hotel and runs 24 hours. Transport is not an issue with this location - subway rides were short and get you pretty much everywhere you need to go quickly, cleanly, and safely.(Highly recommended that you purchase an Oyster card - a &quot;touch and go&quot; pass - if you plan to travel a lot on the subways and busses; there is a little newsstand down the street that sells them.)All in all this was a great place to call &quot;home&quot; when touring the city. Highly recommended for those on a budget."
198,802,"Jun 15 2007 	Good price excellent condition and handy location	We stayed here in two interconnecting rooms with the children in one and us in the other (50% off second room with Hilton!) and were visiting family nearby.The hotel was in very good condition and thought the rooms looked newly refurbished and were very clean and in excellent condition. I think we were at the back of the hotel though as we had a fetching view over a load of aircon pipes! Communal parts of the hotel were in good condition, there is a gym but we didn't use it and no pool which is a shame. The breakfast was the usual Hilton brilliant buffet breakfast with good choice, well cooked and plenty for everyone. Staff were efficient and friendly.When booking with the central reservations they advised that no roll-away beds were available but on check-in they did have the rollaway available - so if possible I would check with the hotel before discounting it.Location wise we thought it was excellent - the lovely leafy Holland Park is within easy walking distance and Holland Park tube is 10 mins walk away and gets you into theatreland direct in about 15-20 mins. Easy to get into central London but in a nice leafy area so not too congested.Speaking of congestion this hotel is literally 5 meters inside the congestion zone which is a little annoying and the parking costs a bomb. If we'd known we may have looked into a nearby car park outside of the zone to save a bit of money.All in all we would definately stay here again and think it is a great hotel."
199,802,"Jun 12 2007 	Dont waste your money!	This hotel was terrible. The staff were extremely unproffesional and unhelpful. I had been traveling all night and wanted to check in at 11 am, and i was told me Hilton customer service that i could do so because the hotel was not booked/busy. It wasnt until i got irrate with the front desk staff that checked me in early. I have hitlon honors membership and they were still rude and gave me no preferential treatment. The rooms are really small and dont have a view of anything. the hotel is not located close to any landmarks."
200,802,"May 29 2007	Very comfortable nest	We were looking for a hotel in London and the prices made us pause. We settled on the Hilton Kensington as a compromise because it was affordable. The location was in a semi-residential area but convenient to the Tube. The accomodations were very comfortable and quiet. Our room came with a small refridgerator which was convenient. Breakfast was delicious. All around pleasant and quite satisfactory stay. BTW, it is located conveniently near a small supermarket which had sandwiches and fruit - a nice light dinner."
201,802,"May 23 2007 	Hilton Kensington - Nice facilities	We booked the Hilton London Kensington through Expedia and stayed for 4 nights.. May 18th - May 21st. I had asked Expedia for an early check in, but there was no response and when I called to ask about it, they didn't have any information. When I arrived at 11 AM, the desk clerk was able to accommodate my request and was very gracious about it. They checked me in with my Hilton Honors account, but I never saw any benefit that I know of. The hotel is in a very residential area, but within a 10 minute walk of the Holland Park Tube Stop (out the door and turn right.). There's a small supermarket which has the essentials - fruit, sandwiches, drinks and you're just minutes from a Starbucks. Bus 94 runs from the hotel to Oxford Circus. The rooms were small, but very clean and included a small fridge and lcd tv. I didn't try the continental breakfast but it looked very good and the bar / lounge was hopping every night. The walls are on the thin side so we got to hear our neighbors discussing her parents and their marital problems. They keep the hair dryer in the desk drawer vs. the bathroom. The fitness center is very nice, with 3 pieces of cardio equipment and a couple weight machines as well as a good selection of free weights. In addition there's a coed sauna and steam room. if you like to get a morning run in, the neighborhood is safe and gives you a pretty wide range of terrain. I only had two issues with the hotel. When I checked in they asked if they get my credit card to guarantee the minibar, and i asked that they turn off all credit for the room. When they did that, they locked the refrigerator using a remote control. Unfortunately I had put a soda in there, and was unable to rescue it until the morning I left. The other issue was with the Concierge, and unfortunately I didn't get his name. When I went to him for assistance in booking tours, cabs, etc. he was extremely efficient - almost to the point of being a caricature of pompous actions. However when i asked to confirm my return trib to Gatwick via Hotelink and poied out that I'd already made arrangements, he changed to simply calling and getting a confirmation number. Neither of these had a significant negative impact on the trip or even the hotel experience."
202,802,"May 20 2007 	Good but not exceptional	This was the first time I stayed in a Hilton hotel, and although it was a good experience it fell short of the high expectations and esteem I had for the Hilton chain. In all honesty, this hotel is not remarkable for anything: not for the area it is located in (on a busy through road in a residential area about 4 km from the center), not for the exterior of the building (an average though well-maintained plain brick facade), not for the rooms or the reception area or the service provided. It is all nice and good, but the same can be found in many 3 and 4 stars hotels throughout the city.Rooms are smallish, and bathrooms even more so. Some of the rooms were recently refurbished, with more light colors, modern lighting, and a flat screen tv as the main benefits. I've seen a non-renovated room too, and the difference was not that big so no need to make a scene when you find out you got an old one. Airconditioning works fine and the window is well isolated so hardly any noise nuisance from the busy street in front of the hotel. Beds are supersoft, and there is a selection of pillows.I didn't take the breakfast because it was quite expensive (12 pounds for continental, 16 for British breakfast), but there are many good sandwich places close to Shepherd's Bush tube station (5 min walk) and I believe there were also a few options along the road to Holland Park tube station (10 min walk). As others have noted, the walk to Holland Park is a bit longer but nicer. But the most scenice option for going into the center is of course to stay above ground and take a real London double decker bus: lines 94 and 148 stop just opposite the hotel and run very frequently during daytime and once every half hour throughout the night.I would not hesitate to stay again in the Hilton Kensington on my next visit to London, but this time I'll have the benefit of more realistic expectations. As long as the price is right (I paid 80 pounds per night though the hotel's website) this is a good place to stay."
203,802,"May 17 2007 	Very nice place to stay!!!	My wife and I stayed here for a week in May and really enjoyed it. Check-in was very fast and we were able to check in early, which was very nice considering the 8 hour flight. I am a Gold VIP with Hilton and although an upgrade was not available, they gave us free breakfast every morning of our stay. The concierge was also very knowledgeable and helpful. Our room was newly renovated and was very comfortable. The shower was a little small, but pretty normal for European standards. The breakfast buffet every morning was very good!!! A very nice assortment of food, from traditional English fare to waflles, pastries, fruit and made-to-order omelets. We really enjoyed the walk from the hotel to the Holland Park tube stop, it is a very nice part of London with tree-lined streets and unique shops and restaurants. We especially liked Nicholas wine shop and an Italian restaurant called Edera. There is another tube stop (Shepherd's Bush) that is closer to the hotel, but not as nice of a walk. The tube is very convenient to central London and very easy to navigate. We enjoyed our stay here very much and would definitely stay here again!!! If you like the hustle and bustle of downtown London, this is not the hotel for you, but if don't mind being away from the madness, this place is in a beautiful neighborhood and will definitely meet your needs!!!"
204,802,"May 16 2007 	An excellent experience don't listen to the negatives!	My stay at this hotel was a great experience from beginning to end. It is a walk from the nearest tube station, but a beautiful one at that. Primarily we walked past homes and shops. On the journey, there is a Starbucks, Tesco (grocery store), and a few restaurants. This helped us in our stay and made the walk enjoyable too.Once we got to the hotel, there were no problems checking in. I found the desk staff to be pleasant and helpful, once we understood what each other was saying. The hotel has a travel desk that was helpful for us to get information from. In the main lobby, there is also a little shop that sells some souveniors and stamps, plus there were about 5 computers with access to the internet at an expensive price. Once we got to the room, I was continually pleased. Everything was clean, the flat screen tv was a perk, and bed was comfortable. The bathroom was also great. Honestly, I don't have a bad thing to say about this place. It seemed quiet to me and allowed for a lot of privacy. The buffet breakfast in the morning was not cheap, but well worth it. I'd recommend paying extra for it because there isn't a lot around for breakfast foods otherwise, plus it helped to get our day started off on a good foot. The food was good - we only had breakfast there. Go stay here. Yes, it's a little out of the way, but you won't be disappointed."
205,802,"May 13 2007	great hotel a little out of the way	The Hilton was a great hotel to stay at in London. It was far from the major sites, but transportation was easy. The bus stop is directly out side the front door of the hotel. The rooms are clean and staff was friendly. Bathrooms were average. Same type of hotel that you would expect in the US from the Hilton. There are not any places to eat outside of the hotel. There was one Indian and one Greek restaurtant but that was it. There is a grocery store 6-7 blocks away for drinks and snacks. The hotel does have a restaurant, but it is expensive and not open late. Overall, the was a great hotel for the price. Easy to get to and I would stay here again"
206,802,"May 12 2007 	A disappointing experience	I stayed at this hotel, primarily for the price. Although the hotel was a bit out of the way in the Holland Park/Shepherd's Bush residential area, the Shepherd's Bush tube station was only a couple of blocks away and buses stop outside the hotel that go to the West End. I found the room to be comfortable and clean but quite small and the toilet did not flush properly. Overall, the accommodations and staff were not up to Hilton standards in the United States. The initial room I was given had not even been cleaned-- the bed was unmade and cigarette butts filled the ashtray (I did not request a smoking room).  I was subsequently given another room; however I experienced a power failure. When the staff was unable to resolve the problem within an hour and one-half or so (by then it was 1:30 AM) I was given another room and told by the manager on duty that the hotel would refund one night's stay. However, when I checked out, the desk clerk reneged, after checking with the duty manager, saying that because I booked through Expedia, I could not obtain a refund. While I was offfered extra Hilton rewards points and after some negotiation, a free breakfast and a waiver of a 15 pound bill for telephone calls and a soft drink from the mini-bar, the 15 pound bill was charged to my American Express card. I wrote to Hilton about the issue but have not received the courtesy of a reply.Other complaiints include an inability to print a document from a business center computer and an unconscionable 20 pound ($40) charge at the hotel bar for a mediocre Caesar salad and small beer. Fortunately, there were a number of good restaurants in the area that charged significanlty less for full meals. I would not stay here again."
207,802,"May 11 2007 	well...it was ok	From outside it's very depressing! when I got there I thought &quot;oh gosh, I hope it's not this one!&quot;. obviously, it was. Fortunately, when we got it, we found it pretty pleasant and modern. Check in was amazing, and here I want to thank Ian for being so friendly and helpful. We went to our room (executive) but when I got it...what a surprise! very small...exactly the same as other standard I went to in other hotels. That was a bit depressing, coz I was hoping in a very luxury week end away from Manchester with my boyfriend...but anyway, we were happy because the bed was very confy and we had a bath. The executive lounge was a bit upsetting. very small, with view on the roofs...mmmh...no alcoholic drinks on a saturday night! well#...we had a tea. But, at the end, it's worth a visit just for the breakfast. amaaaazing! plenty of EVERYTHING and I mean it. I've almost got sick to try all that stuff, and it was so tastefull and nice, from the bacon to the waffles!But...I wouldn't come back, honestly, I'm sure you can find a real executive in London.PS: it was also very noise...it sounded like there were enormous washing machines running up and down the corridor, night and day. very weird...."
208,802,"Apr 29 2007 	Wonderful	Wonderful hotel to stay for the price we paid. Great location. Buy the Oyster card and take bus #148 or #94 to get to the main places. Walk for 7-10 minutes and take the tube (train) at the Holland Park station. If you walk to restaurants, the prices are high and not great food but if you take the bus to Notting Hill (5 minutes) there are plenty of fast food restaurants and great food. I asked for a renovated room and one was given to me. I also asked to check in early and the room was ready at 10:00am which is pretty good. Starbucks is close by. The only thing I did not like was the construction going on around the hallways and I once was awaken by the construction. Will stay there again!"
209,802,"Apr 25 2007 	Not wowed	I am a Hilton Gold VIP HHonors member and had to stay here because all other Hilton hotels were booked up. I had stayed at the Hilton Paddington earlier in my trip, and so am comparing the Hilton Kensington to it, since the stays were just days apart.Overall, not quite up to par for a Hilton. If you are working near this hotel, then stay here, but, overall, it is not too convenient a location and far from the closest tube stop.I had to check in very late due to a late flight and the front desk was nice, although they could not upgrade me. They offered breakfast vouchers instead (two vouchers for three people), but it didn't matter since only I ate breakfast, in the end.The bedroom was small-ish and they had to roll in a cot (which we had pre-arranged). It arrived reasonably quickly, given the late hour, and was pretty comfortable for a roll-away. But there was barely enough space in the room to fit it (we had to put the side table underneath the desk to fit the cot!).Everything worked, which is always nice.Again, nice to have a bottle of still and a bottle of sparking water -- my fave perks (and quite necessary for a dehydrated frequent traveller).The bathroom was fine, nothing special, but good water pressure in the shower.Concierge was very helpful with directions to a hard-to-find art gallery.Internet access was supremely overprices.Overall, very clean and usable room but I'd recommend the Hilton Paddington over this one, if the prices are comparable. For 250GBP a night, I'd prefer something a little more luxurious.Check out was easy and the breakfast buffet had quite a large selection, though most of the food was mediocre and the service was spotty and inattentive."
210,802,"Apr 23 2007 	great hotel lovely staff	stopped at the hilton kensington as our friend was running the marathon, we booked the hotel where you great the meal on the first night, went to the restaurant was met by one of the friendly members of staff, who then showed us to our table, meal was fantastic and wine was quite good value for money at only 18.00 a bottle. The wine in the bar is 7.45 a glass so buying a bottle is a lot cheaper. The room was excellent but then we did get free upgrade being a hilton honors member, our friends room i must admit did look a bit tired and worn out, but it was clean and fresh. Breakfast was excellent, with a huge choice of food. The street on which the hotel was on was nice too with lots of nice little restaurants and bars for you to eat in, the castle pub was lovely and the staff nice there too. I would recomend this hotel to anyone who wishes to have a nice place to visit london"
211,802,"Apr 20 2007 	Bed! Very bed! Too bed!	Staff is &quot;ok&quot;, just &quot;ok&quot;...The rest is ...Don't know how to describe! Do not go to stay at this hotel if you have any other chance. Gold HHonors member and stayed many Hilton's worlwide but this the worse. I have no idea what Hilton guys doing at their offices. They don't know, or they don't care what is going at this hotel? Room is so small, old furniture, noisy (from tubes, air conditioner, from the street, from the corridor, from everywhere)...Check-in was ok but than everything was unbelivable! I asked concierge to arrabge a cab for me to the airport, his friend came to pick me up! I asked concierge where is the nearest sushi rest, he said in Notting Hill, walking 10 mins, went there, took 25 mins, abd it is a take away place! No heating in the room, freezing in the night! Oh, I just don't want to write more, but this is not only the worse Hilton I have ever seen, but one of the really bed hotels I have ever seen. If you have any other chance, if you don't have to, stay away from this hotel. I am not sure that this is a real Hilton."
212,802,"Apr 17 2007 	Lovely affordable Hilton in London	This is always my first choice when in London as its affordable luxury (can normally get rooms for 60 - 90 a night) which for London is good. Bus stop outside that takes you to Oxford Street in about 15 minutes, could walk it in about an hour through holland park, nottinghill then bayswater.Stayed here about ten times and have never faulted the service you receive and neither has any friends and family who have also stayed here. Beautiful hotel, lovely rooms and staff are brilliant and friendly.Good restaurant just up the road, cant remember what its called but an americam theme and is good (brown windows and doors and near the tube)Lovely area and nice to walk around the hotel as it has amazing houses and parks close by (can walk through the actual prk to get to kensington high street)."
213,802,"Apr 15 2007 	A detailed(ish) review of the Hilton London Kensington and surroundings	Firstly about the location and getting to and from the hotel. Be sure to buy an oyster card as this is the cheapest way to travel in London and gives you access to bus and tube routes depending on which zones you need. The tourist zones are 1 and 2. Youll probably never need to go out of these. The nearest tube station to the Hilton London Kensington is Holland park tube station (central line), but that is a good 15 minute stroll along Holland park avenue. The tube was closed for the majority of my stay so I had to rely on busses and Notting Hill Gate tube. The area is safe and has plenty of shops so if you forget anything from home, you can find a Tesco Metro next to Holland Park tube station.Also, Busses to Piccadilly Circus (the 94) stop over the road from the hotel so this was convenient.This hotel is OK and really thats all I can say. Standard. It does not have any kind of WOW factor nor does it have particularly impressive interior (considering it's just been renovated). After check in (which was swift and pleasant) I made my way to the room which was on the executive floor 6 (floors 6 &amp; 7 are executive floors) and when I entered my room I was really quite surprised at how small it was. The bathroom was really tiny and didnt have a bath! Im 60 tall and my head almost touched the ceiling in the shower! Although the room was small, it was equipped with all the necessary toiletries etc (complimentary bottled water in the room, The Times in the morning -that sort of thing).The executive lounge is definitely worth visiting. Every morning a continental breakfast is served and snacks and soft drinks are served during the day. In the evening between 6:00pm - 8:30pm alcoholic drinks are served too. The good stuff like bottles of Stella and Becks larger, red and white wine and all top brand spirits and mixers, even Courvoisier brandy! Cheers!There are a couple of bars and clubs in Notting Hill and a Pizza express, but really you want to be in the heart of the west end lapping up the atmosphere when in London. If you want to book a show, I recommend you do this prior to your visit as you will pay a lot less. Dont use the hotel concierge! If you dont have time to book tickets before your stay, you can buy them from booths in Leicester Square or even at the theatre box office. I went to see Little Shop Of Horrors (my favourite show) and Les Miserables and both shows were absolutely fantastic! Just be extra careful when in London. Tourists are targets for being ripped off. Im originally from London but have lived in Manchester for years and I know that you can sometimes feel uneasy. This year in London I must have been approached by a beggar on a daily basis. Maybe its coincidence but Im sure it hasnt happened as often as in previous years. Now I know this happens in all major cities, but just be careful about who you buy tickets from and street traders. Common sense really! Tours every visitor to London MUST do are: The Tower of London (see the crown jewels), St Pauls Cathedral (for its sheer beauty) and see a west show (please see little shop of horrors if its still on, I gave the cast a standing ovation. Alistair McGowan as the dentist was hilarious and Sheridan Smith as Audrey had a fantastic voice very talented. A really exceptional performance. all the cast were exceptional!). Now back to the hotel, it has a small gym, a sauna and a steam room which was OK but I only used it once. There is a bar and a restaurant on the ground floor, but again, youre in London GET OUT OF YOUR HOTEL AND TASTE THE CITY!Really, youd have to be a bit boring if you want to dine in this very standard hotel. Its quite hard to imagine this hotel has been recently renovated. Im not saying the hotel is scruffy or dirty, just not very modern. The TV in the hotel rooms are very standard. Youd probably expect an LCD TV in a freshly renovated 4*hotel, but not this one.If the executive floors have such small bathrooms, I cant imagine how small the other rooms are.My only real complaint with this more than adequate hotel is the size of the room. This was the first hotel Ive stayed in where the bathroom had no bath, and I would not expect that from a 4* Hilton Executive room. This is why I have rated it this way.I was mainly comparing this hotel to the Hilton Paddington, where I stayed at last time I was in London. The executive room I got there was much bigger and had a coffee percolator, bigger TV and just generally higher standards. More like a suiteSo if you want a little more space and a more central location, maybe this hotel would be better for you. I hope this review has helped. Id be happy to answer any questions."
214,802,"Apr 13 2007 	FANTASTIC TIME!	I have just returned home after a two night break with my Husband and 8 year old son. From the moment we checked in, to the time we left, we could not find fault with anything. The rooms are quite small, especially with three in the room, but when in London there are so many more things to see and do than sit in your room! Although small, we find the rooms always exceptionally clean, and I am very fussy! The staff are particularly good - the restaurant staff (breakfast), the reception, the house keeping, the concierge and in the executive lounge. They are all very attentive and couldn't do enough for you.The breakfast is very good, as they are in most Hilton hotels.The location is in a very picturesque, safe neighbourhood but so near to the tube stations that your trip into central London is very easy. The Tesco Express on the way is good for picking up a picnic lunch to save on money and queuing later in the day whilst out and about sightseeing.This is our second stay here and have tried various other Hiltons in London, but this is our favourite and plan another stay in the Summer."
215,802,"Apr 10 2007 	Will Definitely Return	I stayed at this hotel for about three days and would definately stay there again. My boyfriend and I were visiting London for the first time and this hotel suited our needs and wallets perfectly. I have stayed in some so-called decent hotels and been disappointed in the past. But this Hilton was clean and had all the amenities I wanted. There are two bice restaurants in the lobby, one that is even open 24 hours. While we were there, they were renovating, but we honestly barely noticed it. Also, the staff were the most friendly people we encountered in London, and were very helpful. From the moment we walked in, they made us feel comfortable.My only caveat is that our standard room was on the small side. It was especially hard to lug our bags into the door. For two people, next time I will definately upgrade my room. Other than that, the room was great. The furniture, bedding, and bathroom were clean and looked new.This hotel also worked well for us because the area was near everything we needed. There are two tube stations within five minutes or less walking distance. The street is also lined with cafes, a few restaurants, a small supermarket, a couple convenience stores, and even a Starbucks. We actually ate at a pizza place about three minutes from the hotel that had excellent pizza.Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. It was great to come back to this hotel after a long day of walking and signtseeing."
216,802,"Apr 10 2007 	Stay away from room service!	We stayed here for 5 nights---a nice average Hilton Hotel, which was undergoing renovations. The location is good and, while not in an area with much nightlife, was easily accessible by bus or tube. However, the room service food was very poor! My husband had a pizza which was similar to the lower end pizzas sold in the frozen food section of grocery stores. Very poor quality. Then he ordered a steak pie, which was so hard it couldn't be eaten plus the bottom was burned. He asked room service to bring another one and received another pie in the same condition. The waiter said that is how they're delivered to the hotel. He had the waiter return that to the kitchen as well and asked that it be removed from the bill, which they did not do. We had to ask the hotel management to remove the charge. Clearly, the kitchen just orders some frozen food from a central food concern, probably pays a dollar or two for each meal and then jacks up the price sky high. One would expect such low fare in very low class hotels or restaurants, but not in a Hilton and NOT AT $20-30 PRICES!!! If the pizza had cost the hotel a dollar, I would be surprised. The kitchen management should be ashamed of itself for serving such inferior food."
217,802,"Apr 5 2007 	An average Hilton	I arrived late, check-in was quick. The room was on the 1st floor and luckily on the back (the front street is really busy). The room size is standard for London, the bed was quite good, the bathroom very small. Chair and carpet weren't that clean (something I would accept in a cheap motel, not at a Hilton) and the walls and bathroom should be refreshed. BTW, if you are 1m90+ don't try to shower, your head would hit the roof.Haven't checked out their breakfast, there's a Paul and Starbucks a good 5 minutes walk from the hotel (next to Holland Park tube station)."
218,802,"Mar 28 2007 	Lovely Neighborhood- Standard Hilton	We just returned from a three night stay in London and found that this Hilton more than met our needs. The room was a very decent size (although the a/c didn't work too well) and everything was clean. It really met all Hilton standards. Great neighborhood on the other hand- close to Notting Hill, five min to the metro stop... we found the staff to be friendly and the overall stay was great. With all the hotel options in London, this is a very safe bet."
219,802,"Mar 21 2007 	Just OK	Stayed here over New Year 2006/07...Accommodation pretty standard; breakfast OK (though exceptionally long queues on a Saturday morning)...very average in general (nice to have an ice machine on each floor though).Hotel is expensive for what it is...if you have a car (which we had) the introduction of the congestion charge would put you off paying it and staying here.TipIf you've a car, the hotel carpark is extortionately expensive..park across the road in Royal Crescent (no charge after early evening or from Saturday afternoon- Sunday)"
220,802,"Mar 18 2007	Dreadful	Terrible hotel. Unfriendly, unhelpful staff. Dirty rooms (someone's old sock in mine, coke cans and newspapers on floor of my colleagues room). Would not stay here again if at all possible."
221,802,"Mar 13 2007 	Great value	We just returned from staying at the London Hilton Kensington. The room was large for European standards. We were on a floor that was being remodeled. Construction was ongoing during our entire stay, but it was absolutely no problem. They worked quickly, and they never bothered us at all. Our room hadn't been remodeled yet, and it was still in fine shape, so I can only imagine how it would be to be in one with fresh paint, wallpaper, and carpeting. The concierge was helpful. The lounges and the restaurant were busy and nice. The frontdesk was helpful as well. Overall, we had absolutely no complaints and the price was excellent. As far as its location, we travelled to the touristy sites daily, and found this area to be convenient, as it was near the Holland Park tube stop and two buses stop directly across the street. We stayed out late for the pubs, and had no problem getting back to the hotel on the transit. This may be the best kept secret in the Hilton chain in London. It wasn't breathtaking, but highly adequate for a visit, work, or simple leisure. We saw some of the airline employees staying here as well. I'll certainly return to this hotel if I have the opportunity."
222,802,"Mar 5 2007 	small but acceptable	My husband and I stayed at this hotel while we were having a long weekend in London for a friend's wedding. Our flight arrived early in the morning and we wanted to rest for the wedding later in the evening. We explained this to the staff and were able to get a very early check in time. The room itself was fine. Everything was new and clean and very modern. The bed was very comfortable as far as hotel beds go. The bathroom was small but the shower did have plenty of water pressure. The shower stall was very small (no bathtub) and really tall or really obese people might have a difficult time. The room was also really small and a little hard to get around if two people are trying to dress at the same time. There are renovations going in the hotel so there is some noise during the week. Overall the hotel was just fine but certainly not luxurious. It was clean, the staff was helpful, and overall we had no problems. We like the Kensington area as we have been to London a few times and have our preferred neighborhoods. If it is a first visit to London, the location might not be so great and you might want to stay somewhere closer to the center of town."
223,802,"Feb 18 2007 	Not worth the price	Only stayed for 1 night prior to being picked up for a tour. I had just arrived from a long flight and was really tired, I arrived about midday and they would not check me in early which is fine they have to stick to the 3pm rule until I heard the person checking in beside me ask the same thing and their request granted. I should have made a scene to get my way but I didn't so not sure how successful I would have been.The room I had was tiny there was nowhere to put the suitcase not sure if others in the hotel were larger. The room was basically as big as the bed with no room to get around the bed. Bathroom was extra tiny. The room was clean with modern decor.Very spacious lobby &amp; restaurant. Only had breakfast there and it was OK nothing too flash but perfectly adequate.Didn't try public transport from here but it did appear a bit out the way"
224,802,"Feb 17 2007 	Acceptable but could do better	I arrived early after a flight from Cairo at about 11am and due to the hotel being fully booked the evening before, even as a hilton honors member was not able to get a room until about 1:30. Bad luck here. The staff at the front desk was very attentive and did their best to accommodate me. Finally I was given a room. It was small but very clean with a plasma tv and appeared refurbished. I proceeded to sleep for a couple of hours. Upon waking I went to make a coffee and have a cigarette and found there wasn't an ashtray. I phoned and requested one to be sent up and was told it was a non-smoking room though my res was clearily for a smoking room and I had discussed it at the front desk. I was immediately given a new room. The new room was much larger and had a full-size bathtub which I had requested where as the other did not. Everything was very clean. The furniture was tired, but walls, drapes, bedding, everything else was in good condition. The electrical outlet for coffee maker did not work and I had to use floor outlet. The major drawback to this room, even though facing the street and had a big window, was that even with all lights on it was very dark.Likes: Very comfortable bed, roomy for London, price 89 sterling +vat, all hotel staff were great, bus stop right in front of hotel, Shepherds Bush tube 3 minutes walkingDislikes: dark room, 15 sterling + vat broadband, food/drink expensive, AM/PM Lounge staff very unattentive,"
225,802,"Feb 13 2007 	Nice hotel a bit far out	Hotel was nice. about 20 mins from city center but the bus stops just outside the door which is fine. The tube line was out of service this weekend when I was there so i had to get the bus into town. the hotel is very close to Notting Hill, about 5 minute walk. Got a taxi to the airport which cost just under 40, good price and very fast.Room was small but refurbished. Bed was very comfy and shower was great. Hairdryer in the room wwas the best I have ever found in a hotel. Tea coffee and buscuits were nice for a snack. Room service was prompt and food was hot, a bit pricy tho.drinks in the room are expensiveInternet access is expensive 3 for 15 mins.......I would say this hotel is 3* def not 4*"
226,802,"Feb 9 2007 	Comfy bed crappy location	Got this place on priceline for the low, low price of $200 USD per night...what a rip off....priceline quotes this place as a four star...definately overrated....it's a three star at best. The room I booked was renovated and that in itself was quite nice. The bed was comfy and the sheets and pillows made for a nice sleep. If you request a 'renovated room', which you should, be aware that if they stick you on the third floor (which they did for me) they are currently renovating that floor - so it can be noisy. The hotel itself seemed depressing, almost deserted and the moment you enter the lobby from the outside you're hit with a bizarre smell...not a bad smell, just *weird*. If you're arriving from the underground via Heathrow, have fun navigating the route - a nightmare. This hotel is on the outskirts of central London - not much around it but nice homes and offices. If you're wanting to be in the middle of things, DO NOT book this place. If you're wanting to stay in a quiet, isolated place then you'll love it."
227,802,"Feb 6 2007 	Worst Hilton I've ever stayed at	If you are looking for a hotel that lives up to the name of Kensington, DONT stay here. though, the bed was good, it was bad all alround. The service staff is terrible and don't speak English very well. After a long haul flight, I had to wait 15 minutes before I could check in. It seemed that the staff didn't know to call for extra assistance when a queue was starting to form. The HHonors line was way long, and the front desk clerk didn't have the customer service skill to help those that were waiting the longest, but immediately helped three younger ladies that wander into the queue. I mean, was he BLIND to those loyal HHonors customers that were waiting longer?My internet connection, for whatever reason was working, and I called down to the staff and they said they would have an IT person fix it and call me back. Well, she never did. When I call back they had an engineer come to check the connection, and then HE told me to call the IBAHN 800 number. Why didn't they tell me that in the first place.The health club is located on the lower level. The in room brochure said that we could use our room key to go and access the fitness facilities. When I went down there, a staff member said &quot;Oh, you need to get a key from the concierge&quot;...Well, WHY DIDN'T THEY STATE THAT IN THEIR PRINTED MATERIALS IN THE ROOM? This was the third inconvenience, and i went upstairs in a huff (sorry), and because the doors didn't have any hydraulics, they banged a lot. THEN the staff person kinda told me off and said in a condescending way, &quot;there's no need to bang the doors&quot;. AS IF I WAS REALLY TRYING....Also, while they advertised sauna and steam facilities, they forgot to mention that the changing room, the sauna and steam were UNISEX! I can understand the sauna and steam being unisex, but the changing room? No way, Jose.The executive lounge was cramped and crowded. There was no way to relax in that facility at all.Every night that I've called for a wake up call, I've had to repeat myself as to the time. I don't know if it's their comprehension of English, but the hospitality is lacking in their staff.If you can find another Hilton to stay at, do so. I won't stay here again."
228,802,"Feb 3 2007 	Definitely not as horrible as they say...	I got this for $80 on Priceline, October 12-15, 2006. I'm not sure what was going on at the time besides Diwali, but almost all hotels except the priciest ones were completely booked, so I had to settle for this area.I was afraid of being too far from everything since this was my first trip to London, and I wanted to see the touristy stuff. However, it wasn't too bad at all. It was easy to find from the Holland Park tube stop, and I didn't even have to look at my map (go right when you exit, and it's a little way down and across the street).The street has lots of nice shops, bakeries, restaurants, etc., so I was happy to find it was a pleasant area. At some point during the stay, they closed the tube stops closest to the hotel, but the bus that picks up right outside the door took us just about everywhere we wanted to go anyway.Check-in was very quick and simple, and my room was easy to find. I couldn't believe all the complaints when I got there. The room was spotless, and it was huge compared to other European hotels I've visited. The bathroom was a good size, and there was plenty of room in the main area to spread my junk all over my side of the room and still be able to walk around. I didn't bother with the coffee and shortbread, so I can't comment on that. I didn't watch much television, but there were plenty of channels, including an Iranian one that seemed to show the same ongoing soap opera 24 hours a day minus azan breaks. My view of the street was blocked by trees, but I guess that's better than a wall.I ignored the restaurant since I heard the prices were outrageous, and I try to avoid hotel restaurants anyway. The lobby was large and lively at night as I waited for my friend who was arriving from Spain. She got in pretty late, so the only thing open in the area was the Indian restaurant, Bombay Bicycle Club. It was not the best Indian I've had, but it was good enough to kill our starvation.The only problem I did have was with the lack of English skills from the concierge desk. The only thing we asked for was a bus map due to the tube closure. It took forever to explain what a bus map was, and he kept telling us they don't have bus maps and pulled out a tube map and started circling sites we should see. We told him we already had that map and our plans were set, but we needed a bus map. He told us once again that they don't have bus maps. Finally, we gave up and started to head back to our room when he said, &quot;The only other thing I have is this, but it probably won't help,&quot; and it was a bus map! And he had a whole box full of them. &quot;Bus&quot; and &quot;map&quot; are two words you learn in just about every elementary language class, so I don't understand why it was such a problem, but it truly took nearly 45 minutes to get it out of him.Other than that ordeal, and the unannounced construction on my day of departure that made it near-impossible to escape the hotel, everything about this place was fine. We had a great room and great service, so I don't see where the complaints are coming from. But we also got sunny blue skies and perfect weather for our whole trip, so I guess we're just lucky."
229,802,"Feb 1 2007 	So not worth the visit	Myself and my friend decided to have long weekend break...when we arrived everything seemed fine... however the service went down hill...after a day out our room we returned at 7 room wasnt serviced so we waited hopeing next day we would get a service ...a lady knocked and gave us towels and walked away we tried to explain we were on our way our it was half 10 but she said no problem but we returned agin that day and we serviced our own room.... next day wasnt cleaned either.. we asked for towels and were handed them and we went and bought our own t-bags and milk...our room was across from a laundry room where linen and trolleys and bags were kept so every day and night it constantly banged with porters bringing bags and housekeeping going back and forth so we coulnt rest up proper ...even though we explained we were trying to rest... diffrent menbers of staff were going back and forth so it was pointless... my friend had a call card which she rang reception to ask if their was a charge to use phone she was told 50p however it turned out to be 2.50. we tried to explain but receptionist refused to refund anything..hard to believe it was 2.50 just to use the phone when she bought a call card to save money....bar staff and reception staff were very rude and ignored us with conversations about their shifts and days off...and that included a manager....over all these little things of hygiene , noise and bad manners will make sure we will never return again...was very disappointed as stayed in hilton in paddington and was delighted with service"
230,802,"Feb 1 2007 	Comfortable and good for transport	If you want to avoid the high costs of central London equivalents, this is a good choice. You can get some great rates here and it's still easy to get onto London's main tourist trail by tube, Queensway station's just a few minutes walk away. OK, it's not Hilton's best hotel but my room was clean, comfortable and well-equipped, although a little on the small side. Reception can often feel like a bordel but I got a great greeting at the front desk and had nothing but good service from any of the staff. However, plan on eating out (although not at the Indian restaurant across the road) as the food's not the best value for money."
231,802,"Jan 28 2007 	Good Hilton Ken	I stayed for 5 nights in January for a conference. I had previously emailed the hotel and asked for a refurbished room, as I knew some had been done and some hadn't. I had a room on the 4th floor, which was pleasant, immaculately clean and very comfortable. Bathroom was small but typical of a central London hotel. Drinks in the bar were hideously expensive. Good places to eat in the vicinity.Tip - try and get a room on the 4th/5th/6th floor as these seem to have been refurbished.Would stay again, but not if I was picking up the bar bill!"
232,802,"Jan 15 2007 	OK but we won't be staying again	We stayed at this hotel for 1 night and paid 80 through the hotels website. The room was small, it was clean but was looking a little tired round the edges. Our bathroom was tiny, there was not a full size bath, no shower curtain and a rusty shower curtain pole. We did mention to reception that we had a missing shower curtain and it was fitted within 30 minutes. The bar area was very smoky and the drinks were very overpriced (15.00 for a g&amp;t and a jd &amp; coke). We had an evening meal in the restaurant and this was good. If we were coming up to London again for the weekend, we wouldn't stay here again - we have stayed in much better hotels that were not that much more money."
233,802,"Jan 12 2007 	Worst hotel we have ever stayed in	One of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at. We were there for a conference that was going on close to the hotel. Although the reception area was nice, our room was very shabby. Our first evening we were meeting people for drinks in the lobby, I had forgotten my gloves and popped back into our room only to hear a funny sound coming from the bathroom. Upon entering discovered water literally pouring from the ceiling tiles above onto the bathroom floor! If I would not have gone back then, we would have come back to a fully saturated bedroom! Also, the drinks in the bar were astronomically priced. For 6 doubles (which were not doubles) we paid over $77 pounds.! Ordered room service for lunch the next day &amp; had to return the meal..it was cold and tasted as if it came out of a tin! The only concession was that the staff were really nice."
234,802,"Dec 28 2006 	Good value for London	Good value for London, a bit far from the theather area but with 2 subways near by. ( Sheperds Bush and Holland Park).-We booked through the hotel website 3 months in advance and we got a 60 pound rate, very good for London.-Rooms are larger than normal for Europe. ( We even had a side table). ( Ask for de refurbished rooms).-Ok bathroom with bathtobe.-Ok mini bar.-TV, with &quot;on command&quot;.-Very expensive Breakfast. 18 pounds.-Dont take a cab form central london 25 pounds at night."
235,802,"Dec 20 2006 	No care in the world!	Nice location, reception decorated nicely.Other than that, terrible!Overcharged- the price we were told by reception was wrong (admitted it) but still charged the higher as &quot;Dat is die price&quot;.Workmen in the room next door started drilling at &amp; AM- not good when you have been out late the night before, and when complaining- told &quot;We ARE doing works yes. Sorry!&quot;No attempt to placate us at all!Very rude staff in the Restaurant- (You have NOT paid for breakfast) - again, a mistake of the receptionist from the night before.I would NEVER stay in this hotel again- wrote a letter of complaint, to recieve an apology and &quot;Free Breakfast on yoiur next stay&quot;.Considering I had just paid nearly 300 for a terrible experience, I think it's safe to say Ill never be claiming it!"
236,802,"Dec 10 2006 	A Very Pleasant Stay!!!!	The Hilton Kensington was one of four hotels I stayed in during a recent trip and I was very happy with that choice (made unwittingly by Priceline).I had a modern, refurbished king-bedded room on the 5th floor (which I had to request) which was very simply but pleasantly decorated. The amenities in the room were basic but more than enough. Little touches like shortbread biscuits restocked each day were a nice touch. The room was well-maintained each day and the staff I encountered were very friendly and helpful. A mistaken charge to the automated minibar was immediately removed. I also enjoyed the flatscreen TV.My room had a rather grim view westward towards Shepherd's Bush and some other buildings, but it was kind of immaterial.The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Shepherd's Bush tube, round an unpleasant roundabout. 10 minutes the other way along a very pretty tree-lined street to Holland Park tube. Busses outside door (literally) go right to West End.Lobby very modern and relaxed. Everything seemed very new. The health club is in the basement and a bit depressing. I used only the first day. TVs on and fluorescent light, but clean and bright.I would give a very big thumbs up to this hotel and would hope that next time I book on Priceline, it comes up."
237,802,"Nov 23 2006 	The Tops!	I recently spent ten nights at the Kensington Hilton and had a wonderful time. My room was located on the 5th floor and was absolutely perfect. The entire staff, from management to check-in to housekeeping were polite, professional and very helpful. I can't imagine how someone could feel otherwise. The hotel is located in a very nice area of London and is fairly close to two underground stations. I personally felt that the Holland Park station was a nicer walk...maybe 10 minutes at most. Very nice Starbucks near the tube stop for that NEEDED morning jolt!DO NOT, however, make the mistake (as I did) of using the phone in your room. 5 relatively short calls to the States cost me nearly $250. Not the hotel's fault...I should have known better.This hotel is GREAT and I look forward to my next trip to London. I will certainly stay at the Kensington Hilton again!!!!!"
238,802,"Nov 7 2006 	Dissapointed!!!	My stay at the Hilton Kensington was not what I would expect from Hilton. The staff was unhelpful and to get a wake up call it took at least 15 rings before the front desk would pick up the phone. I had also left my luggage there for a few days while I took a short trip to Scottland only to return and find the zipper on my suite case had been tampered with and it took 30 mins just to get it open myself. Not at all the condition I had left it in. Luckily I had taken all my valuables with me! They also charge you a &quot;charity donation fee&quot; without asking or explaining which &quot;charity&quot; this goes to. The room was ok, but really small."
239,802,"Nov 7 2006	Great hotel great location	I booked this hotel through Hotwire and was pleasantly surprised. This was my first trip to London. The hotel is in a beautiful, mostly residential neighborhood close to central London. The homes and parks that surround the hotel are gorgeous. I felt very safe there, even walking around at night. There are plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants close by and the Holland Park tube stop is a few blocks away. I recommend The Castle, a cool pub/bar on the way to the tube stop, as well as Mr. Pumpernink's, a pizza by the slice place. There is also a Tesco Express where you can get prepared foods, fruit, yogurt, croissants, beer, etc if you don't want to spend money on restaurants, which are super expensive (for Americans, anyway, because of the exchange rate). There are two buses that stop right in front of the hotel that take you directly to central London, too. Holland Park is kind of behind the hotel and it's really beautiful, a little green oasis in the middle of the city. There are many embassies and mansions nearby. The room was clean, modern, and very comfortable. I had no complaints. The staff was friendly and helpful and the lobby was nice, with a lounge and a restaurant, and internet access. The concierge was helpful and the tourist bus (double decker, open roof) picks up right in front of the hotel every morning. I highly recommend this hotel. We got a rate of $92 a night (that's dollars, not pounds) through Hotwire. I felt that was an excellent value in a city where most &quot;bargain&quot; hotels start at 100 pounds per night."
240,802,"Nov 6 2006 	Good experience!	I emailed the reservation staff prior to arriving to request adjoining rooms as we have 3 small children and also to request the bed types and non-smoking rooms. The email exchanges were very pleasant and professional. We missed our morning flight and had to take an overnight flight. I called the front desk to let them know that we will be arriving early morning the next day instead and to make sure they keep the rooms for us until check out time so we can shower and get a few hours of sleep. The staff was very courteous and even offered a late check out of 2pm instead of 12noon. When we got there, we were told that we had 3 rooms instead of 2. As it turned out, the 2 rooms which were adjoined were: 1 room with living area/flat screen tv/bathroom/fridge and the other room was the bedroom with a queen bed/flat screen tv and bathroom. The 3rd room was across the hall with two twin beds set up together and a 3rd bed for our 3rd child (with no extra charge). The rooms need some updating but were clean and the beds were very comfortable. The overall experience was excellent and we were very happy with the service and courtesy of the staff."
241,802,"Oct 30 2006 	Extemely Disappointing	After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I was a little worried but went ahead with it anyway. I wish I hadn't, it was a horrible start to a wonderful holiday. I've never experienced staff as rude and unaccommodating at a hotel before in my life. We requested an early check in as we arrived from Australia at 5am and this was &quot;granted&quot;, when we got there we were informed there was nothing they could do but we had to wait until 3pm, then they laughed about it. The hotel room was very old and needed attention, my husband was too tall to shower standing up in the bathroom.I would definitely not recommend this hotel, I just wished I'd listened to the others."
242,802,"Oct 27 2006 	Better late than never - Hotel rooms need facelift	A group of us traveled to London and stayed at this well worn hotel. There are good points to this hotel, as well as negative. The good: location. The hotel has access to close public transportation - walking is also a lovely option and the dining area is remodeled. The negative: Although the dining area has had a face lift, our hotel room was very old and in desperate need of attention. It was very dismal. Also, we were there in July - right in the middle of a nasty heatwave - and there is no air conditioning (and from what I hear, typical of London). Hilton should spend some resources to make the views from the rooms more palatable - we overlooked an industrial site - or so it seemed. I am not sure I'd stay here again - I'd rather find a more updated hotel."
243,802,"Oct 21 2006 	A bit disappointing	Overall I found the the Hilton London Kensington a bit disappointing. The room was tiny for a 4 star hotel, even for London standards, though in general in good condition. However it was January when I stayed here and the room was pretty hot. The only way to get the temperature in the room down to an acceptable level was to keep the window open at all times, which was possible since the room was on the backside of the hotel and not towards the busy street infront. Other facilities were quite limited. The lobby and bar area were pretty hectic and felt more like a busy railway station.The location of the Hilton though is quite good within walking distance of two underground stations, unfortunately both on the same line, bringing you quite conveniently into central London and to Ealing Broadway. From there you can change to the Heathrow Connect service for Heathow airport which is a much cheaper and for this hotel also faster alternative to the Heathrow Express service into Paddington."
244,802,"Oct 19 2006 	Comfy beds	Fantastic hotel, booked a couple of rooms in the executive floor which were just the right size. Our rooms were next to each other which was really good. The holland park tube station is about a 10 min walk and doest take long to get into the centre of London or there is a bus stop outside. We took the bus along to the Hard Rock Cafe and was 1.50 (exact change only) and dropped us off at the corner so quite handy. They have net access downstairs (if you dont have a laptop) which costs 5 for 30 mins, if you need to print anything check with reception that there printer is working before you try printing. (this is handy for printing boarding passes for the plane)If you do get a room at the front of the hotel, beaware that the traffic outside can get noisy police sirens etc so close your window over at night."
245,802,Oct 13 2006	Absoloutely Fabulous	Just came back from London. We stayed at the Hilton Kensington and were completely satisfied. The newly renovated rooms are amazing. The beds are sooooo comfortable. We actually stayed at this hotel two separate times. The first time for three days and the second time for two days. We had a rental car and were able to park underground. Although it is under the hotel it is not owned by the hotel. You do get a discount if you get the front desk to stamp your parking receipt. Area is fantastic - close to the Shepherd Bush tube station or the Holland Park tube station. If you use the Holland Park tube station there is a Tesco Express (mini grocery store) just when you come out so it is handy for when you are going back to the hotel to pick up a few things. The only thing that I can say is to stay away from the mini bar (as always extremely over priced). The restaurants and bars downstairs in the lobby are no better either. But you can walk to Shepherd Bush and there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. But directly across the street from the hotel is an excellent Greek restaurant (Kleftika) - highly recommended. I love this area (my father grew up there and I know the area well) and anyone who stays at the Hilton will be very pleased.
246,802,Oct 9 2006 	Pretty good	Cant understand how anyone could call this hotel &quot;terrible&quot;.I was very satisfied with it for my three night stay. It's about a three and a half star which I got on Priceline for a two star price so I am very happy with it.Nice location with an excellent bus service.Bar a bit quiet and bathroom small but very clean and tidy.
247,802,"Sep 28 2006 	Good for a one night visit	I stayed at the Hilton Kensington for one night at the end of August. The booking was made at the very last minute through and I paid 63 for the room. The hotel is at the far western end of Kensington and is pratically in Shepherds Bush, but at least this way Shepherds Bush tube station was only a five minute walk away! The hotel reception is very contemporary and we received a nice welcome despite the fact that we arrived a little worse for wear at 1.30am! The bar man cheerfully made our nightcaps before heading up to the room. The room itself was rather disappointing as the decor is not up to the same standard as reception and is definitely on the small side; but for the rate I paid I wasn't complaining! Refurbishment of the rooms is apparently under way so maybe the decor issue will be addressed throughout the hotel soon. Had a slight issue after I checked out as a random charge appeared on my credit card statement. A quick phone call got the charge removed but it is something worth looking out for perhaps. All in all a good place to get your head down, but I wouldn't choose this hotel if I wanted to be close to the centre of town."
248,802,"Sep 19 2006 	Not a good choice at all	My mother and i stayed here for two nights in September. Not a good first impression as on checking in after requesting an early check in we were told our room wasn't ready at midday. We had also requested a low floor as my mother is claustrophobic and will not use lifts and this was not granted also. We were told &quot;its only a request not guaranteed&quot; We finally were given a room on the 1st floor but the hotel doesn't have stairs and I had to go up in the lift and go down the fire escape to let my mother in from outside the hotel all through the stay !!!!. The room itself was tiny...our confirmation described a 19m sq room, in reality it was nowhere near that. the room was very very shabby and tired and did not live up to my expectations. At dinner on the 1st night I found a hair in my starter and was only offered a replacement !! plus a glass of wine in the restaurant was 7.45 which in my eyes is extortionate even for London !!. Only plus point was breakfast, plenty of variety and keeps you going all day. I will not be returning, the Hilton group should hang their heads in shame."
249,802,Sep 15 2006	Loved the Kensington Hilton	Just returned from 4 nights at the Kensington Hilton. We got a great advance purchase deal for 65 pounds and it was just great. Even though our room wasn't ready upon arrival at 3pm - the staff were very friendly and apologetic. We had to wait for 45 mins. Hotel is ideally situated in Holland Park (2 bus stops from the Tube Station - 1 bus stop from Shepherds Bush). Great rooms on 4th floor - recently renovated rooms which I made sure I asked for having read previous reviews - a double and twin with adjoining doors as requested. Couldn't believe our luck. Even though its on a busy road its away from the buzz of the city centre and a beautiful residential area. The girls spent their days trying to spot celebrities .... Not a single complaint about the room except to be careful of the minibar. The girls wanted to put some chocolate/coke into the fridge and moved the contents to make room for it. Everything in the fridge is on a sensor and so we were charged for everything that moved !!!! A quick word with reception and the offending items were removed from the bill - no problem.94 and 148 buses stop right outside the hotel and go to Marble Arch and Oxford Circus - or just to the tube stations at Holland Park and Notting Hill Gate. Found the tube much quicker for getting around especially at rush hour.We didn't include breakfast in our deal and don't regret it as there was a Starbucks and Tescos at the Holland Park tube station and lots of little places for breakfast nearby -including the Bagel Factory at Notting Hill Gate. A few nice restaurants in Holland Park and more possibilities at Notting Hill Gate - Pizza Express etc. The Sightseeing bus tour actually leaves from outside the hotel every 20 mins between 08.00 and 10.30 (tickets from the Concierge).Looking forward to our next stay although I suspect the prices will go up once the renovations are completely finished !
250,802,"Sep 14 2006 	Nothing to mention - it's just a hotel	Never had any problems at this hotel - bar a fire alarm at 3:30am, but that's not the hotel's fault - but there's never been anything special, either.Arriving at the hotel, there's a nice lobby area with a doorman who's always happy to get a taxi. Repeated stays has seen the same service time and time again. Check in is normally a lengthy affair, although the staff are attentive and communicative. It just seems like there's never quite enough of them.The rooms are standard multinational affairs, with little flair but efficient enough. Somewhat on the small side, there's nothing to really complain about. However, the shower is fantastic - constant temperature and very powerful!The restaurant is a similar story - fine for what it is, but nothing to excite you, although the breakfasts are generally pretty good.Car parking is underground but, if you've got a low slung sports car, make sure you go in nice and slow - I've managed to scrape the front AND back of my car on the way in and out. Parking is expensive, but competitive for London.The location is right on the corner of Shepherds Bush, so there's plenty of traffic outside but it's never intrusive. There's a tube station within a very short walk, along with shops, bars, restaurant and a cinema. The tube journey into town is always longer than you expect, but it's cheaper than the 10+ taxi ride.What this hotel does offer above many others is good value for money. As a major chain brand hotel, the price (we've never paid more than 75 a night, including breakfast for two) is pretty good, and far cheaper than some more central hotels.Overall, nothing ot complain about and nothing to write home about. It's the Ford Mondeo of the hotel world."
251,802,"Aug 30 2006 	Very enjoyable stay	I booked a two night stay in an executive room over the bank holiday using my Tesco Clubcard Deals vouchers. I was expecting to be treated as a slightly less worthy customer, but on the contrary, as our room wasn't ready when we arrived the receptionist gave us a larger than average room, with complimentary mineral water, newspaper etc. The hotel was quite far out from the usual sights but was convenient for the Notting Hill Carnival which was on that weekend. The tube stations are about a ten minute walk away but the bus stop is over the road. The executive room was great, it had views over London and was very comfortable. The only bad thing I can say is that the wall covering in the small bathroom was badly stained. The benefits of having an executive room were also being able to help ourselves to soft drinks and cakes in the executive lounge during the afternoon, and after 6pm, until about 8pm we could help ourselves to as much alcohol and snacks as we wanted. The breakfast was also served here and was very relaxed. The staff couldn't do enough for us and were very child friendly. There were also balconies from the lounge which had views over London and were suntraps. I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay here again."
252,802,"Aug 23 2006	Ok	Was my 4th time in this hotel in last 10 years. Of course what was 10 years ago is not now. Has a feeling of &quot;getting old&quot;. Second floor looked ugly in colors. I had a room on 4th floor. The night i had to spend an a tiny room, however Hilton Staff moved me to a larger room next day without any problems. Breakfast staff had to be reminded to serve coffee and juice, even though, on being seated I was told that morning beverages will be served. Overall good, clean, nice beds:) but needs a refreshment."
253,802,"Aug 1 2006 	OK Hotel in an OK location	The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood and quite a ways from the historical attractions. There is a bus stop directly in front of the hotel, which is very convenient. But the nearest tube stop is a 10-15 minute walk away. There is a market (Tesco) next to the tube stop, so that was a plus.The staff was very helpful, however the rooms were unbelieveably small (but then again...it is London where space is at a premium!). It was reasonably clean. Try to get a room that doesn't face the street, otherwise the noise from the traffic would be annoying."
254,802,"Jul 17 2006	Excellent for the price!	We won this hotel via Priceline for $67 USD per night. Excellent price! However, the reviews scared me quite a bit! I was expecting a pit! What a shock to arrive at this hotel. Not too asthetically pleasing from the outside, but very nice on the inside. The lobby is very modern, and so is the new cafe. The concierge was very helpful in helping us navigate through the city for museums, monuments and shopping. However, not very helpful in advising us the hip restos and bars. Do you research before you go if you want to go to a few trendy spots! The room was better than expected, small but nicely renovated. ****VERY IMPORTANT: Be sure to ask for a new renovated room at reception.*** Half the rooms aren't renovated...make sure you get a good one! The bathrooms were pretty tiny, shower small, but for $67 USD (40 pounds??) per night, we weren't complaining! Excellent location - bus stops right in front of the hotel. Couldn't be more convenient! However, if you have a limited amount of time and bit more money to spend, I would go closer into town....if you don't mind the tube or the bus, this hotel is great!Cheers!"
255,802,"Jul 16 2006 	Very Disappointing	I have just returned from a business trip to London. I travel to London approximately once a year. I chose the Kensington Hilton due to its proximity to where I needed to be each day for meetings. The room was clean and I am no longer suprprised by the small rooms and high prices in London, including 15 pounds per day for an internet connection at this hotel. The problems with the Kensington Hilton are with the management and upkeep of the property. This was probably a nice hotel 20 years ago. The towel rack was disconnecting from the bathroom wall and was hanging on for dear life which may be why I was never provided with bath towels during my four-night stay. The check-in/check-out stations are not universal so you can only check out at certain computers; however, there are no signs to indicate this so people were waiting in the long line to eventually find out that they needed to go stand in a different line to check out. A colleage pointed me in the right direction so I was not a victim of this confusion but many people were leaving the hotel angry that morning. Once I reached the front of the correct line, it took 20 minutes for me to check out, during which time the person checking me out admitted that she had quit (this was her last week) because of the kind of problems that caused my check-out delay. There are more stories and examples of management problems (one which required management intervention and apologies) at this hotel that I will not detail, for the sake of brevity. U.S. visitors to England, of course, should not expect the level of convenience they are accustomed in the U.S.; however, the level of inefficiency and neglect at this property were a disappointment and I would not stay here in the future. There are better hotels in this price range in London. I stayed at the Paddington Hilton last year which was far and away superior to the Kensington Hilton. It's hard to believe they are both Hiltons."
256,802,"Jul 15 2006	Good location okay hotel	My sister and I stayed at this Hilton in mid June for 3 nights. We got this hotel on Priceline at $68/night (plus tax and fee), which was a great deal. Overall I think it is an okay hotel for the money. However, I have stayed at several Hilton hotels in the US and Japan, and in my opinion this Hilton does not seem to keep up with the Hilton standards. I arrived at the hotel around 11am (my sister arrived late at night) and was told that our room was not ready. The receptionist said that a twin room would be arranged for us by 3pm. The room arranged for us at 3pm was however a room with one double bed, which is on the 1st floor. The room, I guess, must be one of the tiniest rooms in the hotel and its condition was horrible; the carpet was dirty and incomplete bed-making revealed that the mattress had large stains. I should have taken photos of this room. I called the reception immediately to ask for a twin room and the receptionist said that a twin room for us would get ready in half an hour. I was able to stay in the double room until our new room became ready, which was good. But actually I had to wait almost 2.5 hours in the tiny room until I finally got myself settled in the twin room. During this period of time, I found that some of the receptionists were not efficient, reliable, or polite. I called the reception after waiting more than half an hour and was told that our room was not ready yet. The receptionist said she would call me in the next half an hour, though that did not happen. I called again and she said that a porter was on the way to get me the keys for the room, but no porter came up ever. It was almost 5pm I decided to call again. Another receptionist took my calls that time, but hung up after saying one word, Reception, transferred me to housekeeping twice, and then hung up again. I finally decided to go pick up keys at the reception. In the lift, I met a gentleman from the US who said that he just arrived and was going to complain about his room which was being used by another guest. The receptionist finally gave me the keys without a word, eye-contact, or anything, which I thought was impolite. She did not ask me if I would need a porter.The twin room (5th floor) was much larger and cleaner than the double bed room. Housekeeping services were not perfect (e.g., no lotion one day, no washcloths another day, no tissue paper refills, etc.). The concierges were friendly, but did not seem to know much about less touristy places. For example, they gave us wrong directions to Southall and needed to get help from someone else to find the way to Walthamstow. Phone calls from a room are very expensive (e.g., 2.5 pounds /toll free call). Checkout went smoothly. We liked the location of this hotel very much. It is in a nice, quiet, non-touristy neighborhood. #94 and 148 stop in front of the hotel. From/to High Street Kensington, #49 is convenient, which stops around the corner of the hotel. Both Holland Park and Shepherds Bush are close. Several cafes and restaurants including Indian, Chinese, Thai food restaurants, Starbucks, and a French pastry shop (cakes there were delicious!) and TESCO are located between the hotel and the Holland Park tube station. There are many interesting small shops around the Shepherds Bush tube station."
257,802,"Jul 15 2006	Best Hilton for a long time.	We stayed here as a late thursday night theatre stopover as part of husbands birthday weekend and after reading reviews here was worried about what to expect. But from check in to check out couldn't have asked for better service. Definately made up , a little, for some of the problems caused by a Hilton stay elsewhere this year. Used HH points for first time and expected to get the poorer end of the draw as it vas a points stay but got Executive Floor, nice clean room, no outlook but didn't matter this time, quiet with good breakfast and fruit and coffee in Executive lounge.Everyone helpful. Will use again. Thank you London.Do beware if you are parking that Hotel attached car park has raised its prices from those on website and if you don't need your car outside the door then there is an NCP car park over the top of the Morrisons in Shepherds Bush--24 hour, with 24hr security at 10 a day (at the moment) and only a 5/6 min walk."
258,802,"Jul 11 2006 	Reasonable Business Hotel in Charming Neighborhood	I've stayed twice at the Hilton Kensington (which is actually in Holland Park) in the past month and have generally enjoyed it. All the problems I encountered occured at checkin, but after some consultation with a manager were always resolved. Both stays were in refurbished rooms, one large on the American pattern and the other a typical London &quot;single&quot;, i.e., a double-bedded room in a small space. However, for a business hotel, I never felt cramped. The new decor is simple, but pleasant. The hotel is clean and the food, generally good. Staff try to accommodate the customer and were able to meet all my requests (none rock-star outlandish). As is typical of London hotels, the price for breakfast is abusive. There are a number of cafes in the area where you can have a breakfast (including a full English breakfast) for much less. The Shepard's Bush and Holland Park tube stops are easy walks and Notting Hill Gate tube is only a 15 minute walk away."
259,802,"Jul 10 2006	Quiet clean rooms	This hotel was fine. Normal sized rooms, by Euro standards. Breakfast needs some variety. Same thing everyday. Our view was of the roof top--not so great. I would stay here again."
260,802,"Jul 5 2006	Great for 3 adults and 3 boys	We stayed here with 3 teenage boys. We had one adult in one room, 2 adults in another and the 3 boys sharing a third room. They gave us 3 double rooms all next to each other which was great. The rooms and bathrooms were spacious by London standards and the air conditioning was a wonderful relief from the heat. We stayed 4 nights. The only complaint was that the 3rd bed didn't arrive until late in the night (after midnight ) and when we checked in at 1pm they assured us it would be ready. After calling several times and then appearing in registration in my PJs at 12:30am it finally arrived!!! The next day another single bed arrived in the room with the single adult!) We paid 74GBP per night for each room not including taxes.That was the rate we almost paid for a 2 star hotel so we were very happy. There was internet access in the 24hr bar in the lobby (one has to pay for it). Breakfast was not included so we walked down the street to &quot;Tootsies&quot;, a fun little cafe on the way to the Holland Park station (a much nicer walk than the one to Shepherd's Bush...there is also a Tesco's grocery store near the station if you want it) and bought a full cooked breakfast-important when you are with teenage boys who never stop eating- for about 3-4GBP each. Much cheaper than the full breakfast at the hotel for 18GBP. Overall, a great stay and we may use it again next yearif we can get a decent rate. My only caveat; don't expect super service."
261,802,"Jun 29 2006	Check your bill carefully	I stayed at this hotel from 6/11/06 to 6/17/06. Overall it's ok. The air conditioner in the room wasn't cooling the room enough during first couple days when the temperature is in the 80's and very humid. But the most troubling thing is that when I received my final bill on the day I checked out, I found out that the hotel were charging me some items from the mini-bar in the room that I didn't consume. They did remove the charges when I confronted the clerk, but I felt that I shouldn't have to do that. I don't believe it was just a mistake because the hotel did the same to my sister staying in another room. So please check your bill carefully and make sure the items listed are indeed that you have consumed. I do have to say that the staff are friendly comparing to my stay in Holland and Germany. The location of the hotel is also good because there are bus stops right in front of the hotel, and the subway is not too far away either."
262,802,"Jun 24 2006	Make sure to get a room on the 4th floor!	My husband and I arrived at the hotel late at night and were given the only remaining room, a smoking room on the 3rd floor. It turns out that the smoking part was the least of its problems! The bathroom (shower only, no tub) was deplorable; there was dust/dirt/mold caked on the side of the minibar and on one of the air/light vents; the hallway outside was dingy and worn. An absolute disgrace! On the plus side, the bed was comfy.The next morning we were moved to the 4th floor, the only floor which has been renovated (although they appear to be doing renovations on other floors currently), and our room was quite nice, up to what I consider to be Hilton standards. If I were sure I'd be on this floor again, I would not hesitate to stay in the hotel. Otherwise, I would look for another option."
263,802,"Jun 11 2006 	OK but go for Exec Rooms option if on Business	Ho hum another Hilton. It's okay. A notch down from the Hilton Olympia up the road but which was unavailable (fully booked).Good points : great range of support services, clean. Bad points : very small rooms (standard), one of those dreadful baths that are 3 feet long. Bed a bit lumpy, noisy aircon.Helpful concierge booked us two 'luxury' cars to ferry clients off to dinner - however - 5 year old cronky Mercs, will ring my own next time.Just a liittle more effort with the Bar would be welcome. Brightly lit cafe type area devoid of atmosphere.In hindsight I wish I'd splashed the extra 20 or 30 quid and gone for the Executive Rooms which seem much much better and also give you an all-day lounge option. They're on the top floors so also away from the external noise which is considerable.Great little greek restaurant literally opposite the hotel.In summary : does the job fine but definitely go for the Exec room option."
264,802,"Jun 8 2006 	Perfectly adequate	I only stayed here for 2 days by myself, and didn't spend much time at the hotel itself. I found it more than adequate for my purposes. The hotel did nothing grievously wrong. I had a (very) small room which was clean and neat, and appeared to be recently refurbished. If there had been 2 of us, it would have been a bit tight on space. On the plus side, the bathroom had plenty of counter space, in strange contrast to the main room, where there wasn't even space to put my suitcase anywhere but on the floor. The location is quite handy with two tube stations within easy walk: Holland Park and Shepherd's Bush. The latter is the closer of the two, but the walk to/from Holland Park is far more pleasant and interesting. Not very far from the hotel is the wonderful Holland Park itself, one of London's semi-hidden gems: I wonder how many hotel guests realize it's almost on their doorstep. The only two grumbles I have are: (1) the in-room broadband internet service (which costs a ludicrous amount of money) was painfully slow - felt more like dial-up than broadband. (2) the breakfast room, while offering plenty of variety, is chaotic and service is very hit-or-miss: one morning my tea was delivered right away, the next morning I had to ask twice. I'd be happy to stay here again."
265,802,"May 23 2006	Wonderful	My husband and I just stayed two nights at the Hilton London Kensington and found it to be perfect for what we needed while in London. As mentioned in other posts, it is within easy walking distance to the Holland Park tube station and the #148 bus stops right outside the door. It is a quick cab ride from Paddington Station (approx 8 pounds). If you wish to do some sightseeing, the Original London Sightseeing Tour bus (which is a great on-off tour) picks you up right across the street. The hotel is in a great neighborhood with some good cafes and shops as well as being quite close to Kensington Palace and the attached park.The rooms are small in US standards but usual for London and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet (which you should try to get as part of a package) is huge and has variety for any tastes. The staff was very polite and pleasant. We have absolutely no complaints whatsoever and would stay there again."
266,802,"May 12 2006	American Complaints	I booked this hotel and then read the reviews. After reading them I was scared that I had booked at a flea pit with angry staff that did'nt speak english.I was surpirsed to find that the hotel was perfectly fine. It was clean and comfortable with friendly staff and good service. I live in North America and travel quite a bit. This hotel is as good as any Westin / Starwood or other Hilton hotel in North America. Yes, the rooms are smaller and there are less TV channels but this is Europe.A lot of the complaints on Trip Advisor are from US travellers. If my fellow Americans are that concerned about hotels being different from the hotels back home then they should stay home where they know that they will be in familiar surrounding served by people who look, sound and think like they do.Further, do not believe the complaints that the hotel is miles from any tube station. Unless you are 300 pounds with a heart condition, the Holland Park tube station (Central line) is a 8 minute walk. Sure it would be great if the tube stopped in the basement of the hotel but it doesn't. If an 8 minute walk is too much you shouldn't be travelling in the first place."
267,802,"May 11 2006	Lovely Hotel in a Leafy Avenue	We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel. We were given a recently refurbished room on the 4th floor and found it to be very clean and comfortable (if a little small). The staff were friendly - be it Reception, Concierge, Bar area or Restaurant. We booked through the Hilton Website on a &quot;Spring Saver&quot; offer, which included dinner on the 1st and 3rd nights of our stay. The dinner was based on the Table d'hote menu and was lovely. The wine etc is expensive, but it is London!! again we found the same with the bar - 3.75 a pint and 5.95 for a gin &amp; tonic + 1.00 for a mixer!!!!!!!! however, this seemed to be the prices all over this area. The breakfast was buffet style and had EVERYTHING! if you can't find something you like here, then you're just too fussy.The nearest tube station is Holland Park - about a 10 min walk away. This is on the central line(red) and is very easy to use. Alternatively, there is a bus stop directly outside the hotel. The bus # 94 or 148 takes you to Piccadilly Circus for 1.50. However, with London traffic as it is, it can be very slow. There are a few bars, shops and restaurants nearby. It takes about 20-25 mins walk to Notting Hill where there is a lot more. A further 5-10 mins walk from there is Kensington Gardens/Palace. After reading a lot of the reviews on Trip Advisor about this hotel, we were a bit apprehensive about staying at this hotel, but thankfully we found our stay to be very enjoyable and I would definetly recommend it."
268,802,"May 10 2006 	You can do better	The hotel is cheap for London but you'll make up for it in travel costs as it is not near anything (except Notting Hill - the other way is a bad neighborhood as we were told by the concierge). The staff was very nice - that I can say. Otherwise this was the worst Hilton I've ever been in. The hallways smelled very musty and the carpet was worn and stained. The rooms also smelled badly - the bathroom of mildew and urine. There were stains on the carpet, walls and lampshade. The AC/heater was ineffectual and the room was quite warm. The room is very very small - but I was expecting that. We stayed at another Hilton in Edinburgh this trip and it was stunning and lovely. Last trip to London we stayed at the Hilton near Harrod's and that was also very nice with none of the above issues. Also - be warned there are no sheets on the bed. A bottom sheet over the mattress, comforter and pillow cases only. My comforter smelled of cheap perfume so I'm guessing they don't change it between guests."
269,802,"May 9 2006	Needs a new manager	I find it sad that a hotel, which clearly could be so much better, is allowed to exist in this state. On the bad side, you have to wait for everything and it can take fifteen minutes just to check in, the food is bland, expensive and pretty basic, the rooms are small, dark (more so if you don't face the front), the lobby area needs a good clean (as does the bar) and often have blown light bulbs and everything is more expensive than it needs to be. On the good side it is far enough away from central London not to be in a crowded area, but near enough for things to be accessible, it is on coach routes to places like Oxford so day trips are easy, and the staff do try their hardest to do a good job."
270,802,"May 5 2006	Average - Just!	The room that we were initially given was dark, tiny and with no windows, but came with a 'balcony' according to the staff. The balcony doors were permanently locked due to health and safety reasons and it was filthy anyway. We asked to change and did get a much better room but my overall impression is that all the rooms are in urgent need of essential updating, which may in fact be happening, as the foyer has obviously been updated. Definitely not great for a Hilton in Kensington although I have seen worse."
271,802,"Apr 30 2006 	Terrible service	Out of the 3 people staying here, we all had problems. 1. I was assigned to a room that had not been made up, after already having trouble getting a no smoking room, even though I had reserved one. Turns out there were plenty availble, but the person checking me in was either too lazy ot incompetent to figure it out.2. My friend bought a bottle of water in the shop close by. The same brand in the mini bar, but a 10th of the price. They tried to charge her for it even though the mini bar one was still there.3. Another collegue was delayed and was going to arrive after midnight. He rang to ask them to hold his room - they said no problem. When he arrived all rooms were taken and he ended up sleeping something close to a janitors closet - it didn't even have a bathroom!! They tried to placate him by saying they wouldn't charge - how generous of them!Over all the service was terrible and the hotel is mediocre."
272,802,"Apr 25 2006	Very pleasant stay indeed	This was my first time staying in the Hilton Kensington, and was very pleasantly surprised indeed.I arrived several hours earlier than planned, and went to the executive lounge to see if there was a room available. There wasn't at that time, but I was invited to sit down and have some breakfast. Being a small lounge, the range of food wasn't quite as good as other executive longes, but I greatly enjoyed it.My room was excellent, spotless and very nice.I particularly enjoyed the evening snacks and wine in the lounge; the food quality was first class, and as the rain had stopped I could sit on the balcony.This was a one night stay, and I will be most definitely returning!"
273,802,"Apr 23 2006	Great Hotel Great Location	Stayed at this hotel recently on a London stopover and what a lovely surprise. Great location right near Holland Park, High Street Kensington (great shops!), Notting Hill and Oxford Street (more great shops!). It really was a great stay with helpful, friendly staff especially the concierge whom helped plan our sightseeing. They have a new restaurant too which is a cut above normal hotel restaurants and cool decor. The rooms were well appointments and all the facilties for a great stay. We had a nice view over the Royal Crescent gardens too which really was a treat.Would highly recommend this hotel if you are after a great value for money property which is close to everything you could need in London."
274,802,"Apr 21 2006	Expected more from a Hilton hotel	I expected better quality from a Hilton hotel:The bathroom was not clean and had a really strong smell of bleach, The room was constantly cold, Room service was very slow and I had a blown light bulb in my room that despite several reports to the hotel staff was not changed. I would never stay at this hotel again!!"
275,802,"Apr 20 2006	Would recomend!	I booked the Hilton Kensington at the last minute and must say I was a little wary of what to expect after reading some of the reviews left on here.However, I found the hotel to be 'quite a find': situated in a quiet area a few minutes walk away from Holland Park station, a tube ride away from the centre and the hotel room itself was very clean, spacious and above average for a twin room in london for the price paid. I hope to return to the Hilton Kesington very soon!"
276,802,"Apr 9 2006	Great on a budget	Although I have seen many complaints about this hotel on TripAdvisor, I thought it was a fantastic hotel if you are on a budget. I booked it for $80 a night on Priceline and stayed here with a friend from April 2 to April 7, 2006. We had a 2nd floor twin room that was typically small but not oppressively so. Our room looked onto a side street and we slept with the window open and never found it too noisy. Our floor was pretty quiet as well. I would agree with the earlier post about the showers; if you are over 5'4 - good luck! The bus stop is truly right across the street and the Holland Park tube is only 10 minutes away. There is a Starbucks and a Tesco Express (supermarket) right next to the tube. There are also a couple of restaurants and a pub on the way to the tube as well. The Original London Sightseeing Tour also stops right outside the hotel. Unlike earlier posts, we never felt unsafe in the neighborhood even at night. A couple of nights we did take a cab from Trafalgar Sq and Oxford Street and it ran us about 11 pounds. We never had a problem with the hotel staff, who were always helpful. We had unbelievable weather - it rained only 1 day and then blue, sunny skies for 2 full days!! I would definitely stay here again."
277,802,"Apr 5 2006	Awful Awful Property	I am a Diamond VIP with the Hilton Honors Program. I have stayed at many Hilton properties both domestic and Internationally. This property ranks at the very bottom especially when it comes to service, courtesy, and amenities.I was at the property from March 17 through 21, 2006. When I checked in, I presented a voucher for 3 free nights and paid for 1 night. When I wanted to check out from my room using the video checkout the previous night - this feature was not functional. I decided to go downstairs (twice) to inform the folks that they had charged me for 4 nights instead of 1 night. I gave up after waiting 20+ minutes in line. On the day of departure, I pointed to the folks at the desk that they had overcharged me including charging me for drinks that I did not use from the room bar. They said they would take care of it. I am still disputing the charges with both the Hhonors VIP customer service and my Credit Card Company.The room (on the Executive floor) was very small for the two of us and the maid service kept forgetting to leave us toilet paper. I eventually had to track them down and grabbed a couple of TPs to last us for the stay. The VIP lounge was so tiny that guests were leaving in disgust. Luckily, we always found an area to sit down. The breakfast spread was decent.Bottom line - the group at the desk downstairs are so dysfunctional it is impossible to get any decent service. English is not their forte. My recommendation is to avoid this property if you can. I know I will unless I hear back from the HHonors Diamond VIP desk."
278,802,"Apr 3 2006 	Be prepared to Wait for Everything	Be prepared to wait at spend at 30 minutes every single time you need anything from the front of house. Only 2 occasstions did I not have to wait in againt queue - and on those occassions the computer was down and they asked me to come back later when there was a giant queue again, or in the other case I was sent to my room 2 times in a row with room keys that did not work.I left 2 days into my 4 day reservation and moved to a different hotel out of sheer fustration."
279,802,"Apr 2 2006 	Deliberate overbooking	I booked a double room through amex centurion.Arriving at reception there was a queue snaking around the lobby for check in. As a gold card &quot;member&quot; I was directed to check in on the excecutive floor.Another queue to check in - and NO ROOM. The hotel was overbooked!!So an hour wasted - of messing around, waiting and queuing so Hilton can make it's 100% occupancy target. No offer to help book another hotel - NOTHING. There was one girl on check in - with a queue of waiting guests, she had been left on her own - presumably while management hid elsewhere.LAST TIME EVER in a Hilton. They've got too many customers so I'm helping them out by never again being one again. I suggest others do the same."
280,802,"Mar 30 2006	Awful experience moved to different hotel	We were supposed to stay at the Hilton Kensington for six nights, but left after only three. Our stay was prepaid and we took a loss. We were treated disrespectfully by staff and felt unsafe at the hotel and surrounding area. There is nothing near the hotel to see nor eat and the amenities within the hotel are minimal. The rooms are small and old.We moved to the Hilton Gatwick Airport which was wonderful!"
281,802,"Mar 19 2006	Great deal but not a great hotel	Pros:This was a great bargain. I didn't find the location inconvenient at all. The rooms were also nice, I didn't think they were small at all. We were able to check in at 11:30 instead of 3:00.Cons:Breakfast was overpriced and wasn't very good. Neither was the service. If they weren't out of orange juice, they were out of glasses. Every time I found something I liked, they wouldn't have it in the same flavor the next day. We had dinner at the restaurant and the service was awful! My fiance also barely ate a bite of his food.Maid service was horrible at first. The maid either took or threw out my contact lens case not once, but twice! The manager had it replaced the first time, when she took the replacement as well, I believe he had her replaced also. This was very inconvenient though, as I didn't find out until I was ready to go to bed. It took several hours to get a new one."
282,802,"Mar 14 2006	Really really good!	I got a very good deal with priceline and had this hotel for 40 pounds/night!!! We stayed 3 nights and we realy liked it! Except for the fact that it should be called Holland Park Hilton or Sheperd's Bush Hilton, this is an ideal location in London, in a beautifull avenue and very nice neighbourhood. There are 2 tube stops nearby and a bus stop in front of the hotel, with buses to oxford circus every 5 minutes from 7 to 24! Our room was 2042, a standard double room, with a rear view, with very comfortable bed and pillows. The bathroom is very small but cozy, but the bathtub ceiling is very low. We are very tall people so it was a bit inconvenient, but the water pressure and all the fixtures were great. I really recomend it!"
283,802,"Mar 9 2006	Excellent value	My wife and I stayed at the Kensington Hilton from 2 to 5 March 2006 and we were very happy with our stay.Despite other users' comments about the location of the hotel, I would still say that there is nothing wrong with the location, as long as you don't expect to be staying in the city centre of London.In fact I thought it was an extremely nice neighborhood and it is a wonderful 5 minute walk to the Holland Park tube station. There are also a couple of very nice pubs on the way, should you feel tempted when coming home after a long day in the city centre...We knew that the restaurant was undergoing renovation works and therefore breakfast was served in a Japanese restaurant inside the hotel which was no problem at all, except that there was a bit of a crowd in the weekend.Other users have commented on the language skills of the hotel staff, and if that is something you are concerned with then you probably shouldn't come to London at all! The large majority of people working in the service sector in London are foreigners, but I have never run in to anybody that didn't speak at least a bit of English.To sum it all up...The Kensington Hilton is a very good hotel, especially as long as you don't pay much more than, say, 80 per night (incl. breakfast)."
284,802,"Mar 4 2006	Great hotel!	We just returned from 9 days in London at this hotel. My husband is a Hilton Gold member, and we were given an upgraded room. We found it to be a really good hotel, especially for the price. We paid 63 pounds per night. As gold members, we could use the executive lounge. They have a really nice continental breakfast with eggs, cheese, yogurt, rolls, toast, and choice of juices and coffee/tea. The other great thing is evening cocktail hour with hot hors d'ouevres and free wine and cocktails! We actually had this for our dinner on a few nights since we were tired from a day out in London.I had read the negative comments about the hotel and was prepared for the worst. Well, it was really very nice. The room was small but just fine. I guess my only complaint would be the tv stations. I'd have really liked satellite tv, but there were about 6 foreign language stations and a couple of premium channels as well as the local channels. Not a big problem, though, as we enjoy watching BBC when we're there.Overall, this was a fine hotel, and all these complaints have been unfounded, in our experience. The people who think it is too far from the tube are silly....it's a five minute walk! And the bus stops at the front door, just like a taxi, so you can't complain there.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone."
