142,1969,"May 13 2009 	Great hotel the Waldorf	I travelled to NYC with my daughter last week. We had organised to stay at a private club for the 1st 4 nights. We were delighted with the accommodation there, it was 1st class, however they were full for our last night and I had to find somewhere equally as nice, and decided on the Waldorf.Well! What a lovely experience! We were SO sorry we had not spent the week there!!! The room was large and the beds so comfortable. The buzz of the reception, lobby &amp; bar area was electric. I did find the bar and restaurant expensive: but there is a Starbucks on the premises and so many restaurants nearby....u are never stuck for somewhere to eat in NYC!!Our ONLY problem was, that the fire alarm went off at 2am !! It was a false alarm...so could have been worse.New York is such good value, I look forward to my next trip. I will be staying at the Waldorf for the full duration of my trip!Cant wait!"
143,1969,"May 12 2009 	Old fashioned hotel good location	We chose Waldorf-Astoria because the incredible offer on their site (pay in advance, no change of dates, no refund, a room for around 230USD). As we could not find anything better at this rate we thought that trying such a world famous hotel would be fun. In fact the hotel is nothing special, I would say it is fairly average. The rooms are clean but a bit run down, you can see that they have not been redecorated or renovated in decades. The TV is at least 15 years old. We stayed on the 10th and had absolutely no view, only the offices in front of us...I would have been a bit dissapointed had I paid the normal rate......When we arrived nobody offered any help with the luggage and I was a bit surprised to see the internet service for almost 5USD per minute (we came from Central America on our way back to Europe and had no laptop). I was a bit shocked that this was the world famous Waldorf, but with the price I paid it was worth it. I would definitely not pay the normal rate as it would be far too much for this service and quality. I personally prefer smaller, friendlier places and Waldorf-Astoria is definitely none of the above."
144,1969,"May 11 2009	A little underwhelming!	Treated my Mum to a two night stay at the Waldorf Astoria over Christmas 2008. I unfortunately expected a lot more from this hotel, and was a little disappointed with the stay.Check-in was incredibly slow and ended up leaving bags with the bell captain and walked around Manhattan to kill time until our room was ready. Ended up with room 1455 which had fairly average furnishings. The curtains needed a good clean, the surfaces were all a bit grotty and the telephone hadn't ever been cleaned! The bathroom was pretty average but they did provide nice toiletries. The room did have two very comfortable double beds with lovely soft pillows, sheets and gorgeous feather quilts. Had a wonderful porter who was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. Most of the staff we came across were very helpful. No wireless internet access in rooms. To use the business centre downstairs it was a fee of $4.99 to log on, then 80c per minute thereafter. I did get random wi-fi behind the lobby by the public telephones but it dropped out frequently. My advice is to find an internet cafe!Don't drink at Starbucks inside the Waldorf at the 5th Avenue entrance. It's way more expensive than every other Starbucks. After eight previous stays in NYC, I'd prefer to be over on the 8th or 9th Avenue side of Times Square for proximity to cheap and cheery restaurants and bars. 5th Avenue was a little short of eateries at night, but did find a nice little Italian place called San Martin on 49th between Lex and Park. Great food and service was fabulous. I'm sure the East Side has great places to eat, but given the weather on Christmas Eve, we didn't venture too far away. Would I stay there again - No. I think it's overpriced and over-rated. For that kind of money, I'd try the W Hotel or spend the extra money on Broadway shows!"
145,1969,"May 9 2009 	Excellent service though comes at a price	We held our annual conference at the Waldorf in June 2008. The whole atmosphere in and around the hotel makes you feel nostalgic... as if you had stepped into a movie from the 1940s. Highly recommended... though comes at a steep price if you are purely a room guest. We have compared a lot of plush NY hotels and frankly, the cost differential isn't too much.Let's get down to the basics:-Accomodation:- Most rooms are slightly larger than standard hotel rooms that you would find. Though I must mention, that we had a few rooms that extremely large and had enough space to fit in cars.Location:- Right in the heart if midtown Manhattan. Conveniently located for sight seeing as well as business meetings. Taxis, subways, buses... you name... right at the doorstep of this hotel.Service:- The service levels have been immaculate, especially considering that we were hosting a conference with over 200 people participating. The hotel staff is dedicated enough to ensure that your needs are met ontime, everytime.Food:- We had requested special Indian dishes for lunch and dinner... and honestly, the Paneer Makhanwala and Maa-ki-daal were as good as you would find in most Indian restaurants. Otherwise, haveing lunch or dinner in their restaurants can turn out to be a very pricey affair.Cheers...."
146,1969,"May 9 2009 	Very Disappointing	I stayed at the Waldorf for two night on business. I was quite excited because of its history and name, but came away disappointed. I stayed on the 6th floor, the room was small, view of a brick wall, dated furniture and no wireless internet. I ordered room service for room service, 2 eggs/coffee and juice and it was $53. For the price, there are a ton better options and I'll never stay there again."
147,1969,"May 5 2009 	Traditional Glamour and Charm	We were 'upgraded' to this hotel by our travel agents, so found ourselves based here for a two-night stay by happy accident. Our room was allocated to us on arrival at 10.30am and we were delighted to discover it was a very spacious twin room decorated traditionally (lots of florals going on!). The bathroom was somewhat dated but was perfectly adequate for a short stay with good supply of towels and toiletries.We found the bars and restaurants in the hotel to be almost prohibitively expensive, but this is probably due to the weak Sterling when we visited. That said, we had a couple of drinks in the bar near the lobby - everyone just seemed to be having the most lovely time in there and we didn't want to miss out! The hotel is well located for first time visitors to New York who want to do all the sights - we were able to walk to most landmarks, although there were always plenty of taxis to be had nearby if needed. It's always a comforting feeling in a big city to pop back to the hotel to drop off shopping/freshen up before heading back out - and the Waldorf was located centrally so as to allow us to do this. Overall, this hotel is the very meaning of 'faded glamour'. Whilst I'm glad we experienced the charm of the Waldorf I would probably pick a more contemporary hotel for future visits to New York."
148,1969,"Apr 27 2009 	Great First Time Stay at the Waldorf	My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at the Waldorf in April 2009. We stayed for an extended weekend and we had the time of our lives. Upon checking in, we asked for an upgrade and were given a minisuite on the 42nd (top) floor. We found out this suite also doubles as a second bedroom for the Royal Suite, which used to be the part-time home to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The room was absolutely beautiful and had windows that faced 50th Street and you could also see Park Avenue. There was a small foyer, that included a wetbar and refrigerator. Then the bedroom/living area, which had the most comfortable king bed I've ever slept in, along with a desk and chair, couch, armchair, coffee table, end tables and entertainment center with TV. To the right of the bedroom was a small changing area with a closet where the safe was kept along with luggage racks, iron and ironing board. Through the dressing area was the bathroom, which had a tub and separate shower area. We could not have asked for better service. The hotel was convenient to everything and there were a couple subway stations within a block or two. We would definitely love to return to the Waldorf someday, but there are so many other cities/countries we want to see first."
149,1969,"Apr 27 2009 	Average	This is a large, impersonal, busy hotel. We had a one bedroomed suite which was spacious enough for a family of four. The bedroom and lounge were in good condition, comfortable and clean but felt cold and dark even on the sunniest of days. The bathroom was old and very dated. We heard no traffic noise. Drinks and food were expensive.I found the location of Sunday brunch in the main foyer next to the check in desks to be rather odd.I was surprised at the lack of security at this hotel, as anyone could just wander in.The hotel is ideally located and within easy walking distance of many attractions."
150,1969,"Apr 26 2009 	A perfect stay.	From arrival to departure everything was superb. The room was clean and spacious and the staff were just wonderful throughout.There is a guided tour of the hotel, which was actually a really great experience. We learned a lot about the history of the hotel and got to see parts of the hotel you would not normally see as a guest, including the kitchen. I would happily recommend it and I would happily stay again."
151,1969,"Apr 25 2009 	Honeslty?.....I stayed for the name!	The Waldorf is extremely elegant, and as the famous hotel it is i certainly wasn't disappointed. The rooms were not huge but immaculate, and I loved the bathroom, really bright with loads of mirrors! The bed was fabulous (mind you, its so exhausting sighseeing you would sleep on a washing line!) However in New York you spend very little time in your room anyway! It has to be said the people watching in the Waldorf was fabulous full of tux's and ball gowns and me in my Ugg boots! I have to be fair I only stayed in the hotel because of it history but it really did make my trip to New York special!"
152,1969,"Apr 24 2009 	Not worth the moneyyou are only paying for the name.	Thought I would celebrate my 50th birthday with three friends.The holiday wasnt cheap,we saved for a year.We had requested adjoining rooms,didnt get them and later told there was no adjoining rooms anyway.Rooms we basic and cold.Heating didnt work and it had been snowing when we were there.Grafitti scraped on bedside cabinet,shower/bath knob was missing,electric sockets not working.Best of all my friends felt very let down that the hotel hadnt even left a card as the knew I was celebrating my 50th[I didnt mind] so they complained and when we got back in on the first evening there was a bottle of cava and a box of four chocolates left in my room.Only thing was they took the money from my friends credit card for them.They did not reply to my letter nor my emails.I would stay clear of this hotel."
153,1969,"Apr 21 2009 	A Fantastic Hotel Experience!	I too read the not-so-flattering reportst about the Waldorf-Astoria before I left. I did not get the chance to choose a hotel because we were part of a group. I was pleasantly surprised by my WA experience! The service is second to none. They took care of anything we asked for. One night, I needed to ice my foot. Within minutes after asking, I had an ice bag at the door. The decor was upscale and very elegant. The hotel room was large and spacious. The only part of the hotel that showed any age was the bathroom plumbing. I was ok with that though. We had the opportunity to have dinner in the Bear and Bull. Quite expensive, but very nice. A drink in the lobby was about twice what it would have been anywhere else. The food at our two group breakfasts was super, and a perfect way to start the day. Would I stay here again...probably not since it's a &quot;been there, done that&quot; kind of thing. I do prefer the Crown Plaza on Time Square to this hotel. Would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely! It's a great place to experience atleast once.On a side note...we noticed what we thought were hookers in the lobby very late one evening. Not sure if this is something you see in other NY hotels but the were there to &quot;see&quot; someone. I'm not sure if they were allowed upstairs or not. (GROSS)"
154,1969,"Apr 21 2009 	Nice Place....middle of road for NYC.	Wife and I stayed at the WA for a long weekend with friends. Location is central in Midtown which makes it easy to get around. The WA's famous name makes it sound more appealing than it really is. I am not going to rip on the hotel because it is nice but lets face it...It is an old place....and you can sort of tell it. I think the management has done a great job with what they have but the WA is aging and it is easy to tell in some spots. The hotel apparently does not have AC and heat...they only have one or the other. the temp was 80 degrees in NYC but the AC in the hotel had not been switched on. Our room was not uncomfortable but our friends did complain. they were told to open a window and they provided them with a small oscillating fan. It was funny to see this cheap little wal mart fan blowing around a room in the WA. Our room was small but it was well appointed. the bath towels were top notch and the bed was very nice. the 42 inch flat screen was cool too. check in service was polite and the concierge was very helpful. Bartenders were cool and recommended great restaurants. The WA is nice and everyone is as nice as they could be but honestly the place was a little disappointing. Overall, I think the problem that I, and all of our friends, had with WA is that the hotel itself does not live up to its big name. when you say WA you think of timeless elegance and oppulent accomodations. Not bashing the WA but we are just used to something a little nicer and i think most seasoned travelers would be on the same page."
155,1969,"Apr 21 2009 	Beautiful Hotel good service challenged experience.	The Waldorf is a beautiful Hotel with comfortable beds and a helpful staff. Its location is perfect, near the liveliest spots but far enough to allow for a good nights rest. Now for the not so great, our non-smoking room was a smoking room with an air-ionizer placed in it. The hotel double charged our account for our stay, only after placing a hold for 100 dollars a day over the initial quote for the possibility of &quot;incidentals&quot; (ie. minibar, internet use etc). This brought the on hold amount from our bank account to 240% of the initial quote. In the staffs defense, after being told by the desk attendant I was wrong and the charges were correct, the manager called and corrected their mistake, 24hrs later it was corrected, both on paper and in my bank account. The television remote never worked, but we were so tired from running at city speed we didn't have time to notice. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff, attentive and courteous, with the exception of the desk clerk,were always professional. I had high expectations for this hotel, but found myself disappointed when I had to correct another billing issue at check out, this time an incorrect charge for the minibar, of course in the hotels favor. Everything here is specifically designed to seperate you from your hard-worked for dollars. Enjoy your stay here, but double check all billing, and be prepared to direct attention to poorly handled billing procedures. Don't be too nice to make a stand, you will be taken advantage of."
156,1969,"Apr 18 2009 	Convenient Luxury	Elegant art deco lobby. Beautiful entrance - especially from Park Ave. We had the corner room on the 12th floor and it was lovely.Only complaint is that it is a huge hotel. (you don't get that &quot;personal service&quot; feel like from small boutique hotels - there is a long line at the check-in, long wait on the phone, etc.)Great location - centrally located.LOVED telling the cabbie - &quot;Take me to the Waldorf!&quot;"
157,1969,"Apr 17 2009 	Great stay in NYC	My wife and I booked at the Waldorf for a romantic getaway this month and were pleasantly surprised at the accommodations. We booked the romantic package(champagne &amp; breakfast in bed). and were pleased to be upgraded to a tower one bedroom suite, above and beyond the package suite. The restaurants are a bit pricey, we at Qdoba across the street for dinner one night. Had lunch at the Peacock restaurant in the hotel and would say that it is fair, although the fact that it is off the lobby and the people watching was great. When booking in NYC I recommend considering the Waldorf simply based on value. I am looking at booking another trip to NYC and the Waldorf is only about $40 more than the Hampton Inn, so for the extra money I will stay at the Waldorf based on it's status and proximity to local attractions."
158,1969,"Apr 16 2009 	After not expecting much I was pleasantly suprised once there!	After reading the reviews on this I traveled to New York not expecting much from the hotel. Well I must say I was wrong. The hotel is in a fantastic location and I would say that if you were to use all the facilities, which I did not, then it would be worth the money. The rooms were very clean and the staff more than happy to help.Despite the fact my first room was on the small side after requesting a larger room I was given a corner room which proved to be larger, although some bathroom space was compromised. Not to big a problem as that is an area I do not tend to spend much time in.The location was excellent. A 4,5,6 subway round the corner, a ten minute walk to Grand Central and about the same to Times Square. All in all I would recommended you stay here if you get a relatively good deal."
159,1969,"Apr 14 2009 	Great location enjoyable stay	We were really apprehensive with all the previous negative reports, but we have to say we had a great time. When we first arrived, the room we were given was not big enough for my wife and two sons. We enquired with John, the very helpful check in clerk, who moved us the next day to a large corner room.We were on floor 12, which is barely half way up the main hotel building on the front (Park Avenue) corner and we heard almost no noise from passing traffic. You hear the odd car horn but what else would you expect in one of the busiest Cities in the world.We did not eat in the Hotel as we found it very expensive and not suitable for children. The hotel lobby and reception are however stunning and the staff are all very helpful and accommodating. We will return to this hotel on our next trip to NY and our experience does not reflect some of the other entries on Trip Advisor."
160,1969,"Apr 9 2009 	Lovely Hotel	We spent 4 days at the Waldorf Astoria to celebrate my 60th Birthday, we didn't eat in the Hotel as we were out from morning till night sight seeing. On the morning of my birthday I was going to have a lovely bubble bath and champagne, only to find there was no water, we couldn't even have a wash. Disappointing to say the least, we were told that no rooms had any water and that it did eventually come on , but unfortunately we had left to go shopping by then."
161,1969,"Apr 9 2009 	Great historic hotel with modern amenities	This hotel is a gem. The room was a typical size for NYC, the bathroom was really nice, and the bed/linens were comfortable. The decor was impeccable, and the service was great. We would recommend this hotel to anyone."
162,1969,"Apr 7 2009 	OMG the perfect hotel perfect room and perfect staff!!!	My husband and I went to New York for our wedding anniversary and chose the Waldorf because of it's name and also we were offered a pretty good rate. We stayed on the concierge floor (actually 2 flights up on 28) because continental breakfast was included, and we might get a better view up higher. It was the best decision ever! Our room was BEAUTIFUL, with a loungeroom, walk-in-robe, king size bed, fireplace, and although the view wasn't spectacular, it was decent. We just loved going down to the 26th floor for breakfast. Seeing the gorgeous fresh food laid out on proper silver ware and greeted with a smile and kind words each morning was fabulous. Breakfast included cereals, fresh fruit salad, yogurts, smoked salmon, bagels, a selection of breads, freshly brewed tea and coffees, all of which could be taken away and eaten in your room if you wanted. The hotel itself was amazing. Now, we would probably only stay in a hotel maybe two or three times a year, so are not experts or anything, but we know when we are enjoying something and we DEFINITELY enjoyed the Waldorf Astoria. We ate i the famous Bull and Bear restaurant (I enjoyed my surf and turf, the hubby HATED his oven roasted rib), drank in Sir Harry's bar ($9 beer, $12 vodka &amp; coke, $22 cosmopolitan + tips), and walked EVERYWHERE (20mins in heels to times sq!). We even arrived to our room one night to find a bottle of champagne and choc dipped strawberries awaiting us. No, we definitely can't speak high enough of the Waldorf Astoria, LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!"
163,1969,"Apr 4 2009 	Unexpected luxury	The hotel overlooking needs refurbishing, the windows and corridors as well. The hotel located in an excellent place. It is very huge you can loose yourself easly. We didn't get the reserved room, but they offered free breakfast for us. A strange noise from the street had heard. The quality of the service was excellent and stay as well. We've been there only one night. I told the problem for the receptionist at check-out, she wrote it up, I hope they can do something."
164,1969,"Mar 31 2009 	Beautiful stay at a historic hotel.	We chose the Waldorf Astoria for a two-night stay before a Caribbean cruise on the Queen Mary 2. We wanted to combine this modern cruising icon with the historic landmark of NY that the Waldorf is.The hotel is impressive and has this kind of old elegance, charm and finesse that it is difficult to find in modern hotels. It is well maintained, even if some places look tired. We particularly liked the rich wood hues in various walls and the balanced combination of spaciousness and restricted classical atmosphere in many public spaces. Our room was tastefully decorated, giving you a sense of intimacy, warmth and harmony.Service was very good and the staff was helpful and friendly. Actually we experienced this as soon as we arrived, when a kind young employee at the front desk (we remember him with gratitude) upgraded us to a beautiful junior suite at the 17th floor.We had dinner at the historic Bull and Bear Restaurant of the hotel, whose decor and ambience we enjoyed. The restaurant promotes itself for its awarded beefsteaks, and we found our own to be true to the advertisement.The location of the hotel is magnificent, at the centre of action of New York City. Everything was near, and when we needed to do some shopping all we had to do was to walk a bit, simultaneously enjoying the atmosphere of the city. Right outside of the hotel we also found the two-decker buses that we extensively used to explore the city. Overall it was a most memorable stay. Decor, room, service, staff, location were great. We would return to the Waldorf Astoria in a heartbeat."
165,1969,"Mar 30 2009 	Beautiful hotel but rooms disappointing	I have just returned from this hotel and overall the hotel was stunning inside but our deluxe room was dreadfull, it was small and with no heating working outside i could of been staying anywhere in the world as all i could see was 3 brick wall and a generater !!! I imediately complained and was told that there were no other rooms available which was an absolute joke eventually after sleeping in our robes we were moved the next day to a slightly better room. The location is great and we have Brad and Angelina staying there but some how think there room would be a bit nicer than ours!!!"
166,1969,"Mar 28 2009 	You have to go to Chamber Magic Show	Even though I have lived on the east coast all my life, I have never visited NYC. We bought tickets to Steve Cohen's Chamber Magic Show after seeing him on CBS Sunday Morning. The show takes place in the Waldorf Towers, so we decided to treat ourselves and spend the weekend at the Waldorf. The show was absolutely amazing! Mr. Cohen provides an up close personal magical experience. The Waldorf provides the luxury that is expected from such a posh hotel We were able to visit most of Manhattan and then return to our comfortable room to relax. It was a weekend treat that was well worth the experience. It wasnt budget friendly but it was certainly worth the cost."
167,1969,"Mar 27 2009 	great location - threadbare rooms - grand dame is ready for an overahaul	The Waldorf is ideally located - easy access to everything. The staff is incredibly helpful (great concierge!) - but the room we had was pitiful, way overdue for an update. Paper thin walls - with a neighbor who slammed the door at least a dozen times a night between midnight and 2am - the lingering smell of smoke (nasty!) - no glazing on the windows so even on the 19th floor you felt like you were in the midst of mid-town traffic. All the more annoying since I had called the hotel and specifically requested a renovated room (to avoid all of the above). Management was not particularly helpful when I pointed out on my confirmation that I had made the request, their answer was to give my daughter a stuffed bear. A lovely gesture - but a quieter room without the acrid smell of smoke would have been better. My husband is a fan of the Peninsula - I fully understand why. If you want a reasonably priced room and are willing to take your chances with a room which may (or may not!!) be renovated then the Waldorf is just fine. But in a city with so many great hotels - I'd try elsewhere the next time."
168,1969,"Mar 24 2009 	Peacock Alley Fiasco	Our family were in New York for a birthday celebration, as a thank you I booked Sunday lunch in Peacock Alley for 12.30pm. Booking was made by telephone from Ireland, the receptionist gave his name (I will not embarrass him). When we arrived, despite the fact that there were innumerable empty tables we were told that there was no record of our reservation but a table would be found if we cared to wait. We waited and were ignored for 20 minutes, then gave out and went looking for an alternative, a wasted morning and a big disappointment as I had previously eaten there and was anxious to share the experience with my family."
169,1969,"Mar 22 2009 	Fabulous Stay at the Legendary Waldorf=Astoria	This was the second time my 9 year old daughter and I stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria. It is our yearly &quot;Girls Weekend in NYC&quot;. The lobby is beautiful...Art Deco all around. Don't forget to look up at the ceiling and check out the golden clock by reception. If you go to the website you can also download an I-Pod walking tour of the hotel. Fabulous!We arrived early. Although our room was not yet ready, we were able to check in and have our luggage stored until we came back from a Times Square sight seeing walk and some lunch. After our return, we picked up our key and our luggage was taken to our room. We had a corner king (room 1113) on the eleventh floor. Note: After 6:00 pm you need to use your card in the elevator to go to your room. Our room was recently renovated. I had asked for a renovated room because the room we had last year, although very nice and large, was in need of sprucing up. This year, our room had tones of Gold with red, green and beige. The accents were dark wood and brass with beautiful fabric wall paper. There was plenty of closet space. The room included a long desk, comfy large upholstered chair, marble bath with tub/shower and plenty of towels, Lg. Phillips flat screen TV, I-Pod dock/radio/alarm clock with presets, 2 phones, and a comfy king bed with enough pillows for both of us ...I'm a pillow person. The bath had very nice amenities including cotton balls and tips, glycerine soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner. There were heavy drapes at the window with both sheers and pull shades.The views from our two windows were fabulous. There was a great view through the far window of St. Bartholomews church and it's dome, as well as, down Park Avenue. The view from the front window was slightly obscured by the building but Park Avenue was still visible.The only thing I can say that isn't complementary is that our room had uneven floor boards under the carpet on one side of the bed. That's it. And truly, hardly worth mentioning. Nothing more than that. Everything else was great.In the morning, my daughter and I ordered up a small pot of coffee and small pot of hot chocolate. This is where you either like room service or not. I knew what the total cost would be before I ordered. But for those of you who may find this excessive I will explain. Each pot is $8.00...not too bad for a 3 cup pot in NYC. However, there is a $5.25 surcharge per person for your order. There were two of us, so, our coffee and chocolate came to $26.50 plus the $2 tip. If this is too much for you, there is a Starbucks downstairs at street level by the Park Avenue entrance (revolving doors) to your left, before you go up the stairs to the Terrace lobby. Or, you can take coffee downstairs in Peacock Alley or at the Terrace. Overall, everyone we interacted with at the Waldorf, from the doorman to the concierge to the reception desk to the waiter who brought up our beverages in the morning was very professional, courteous and helpful. They made my daughter feel as if she were a princess in a castle. The location can't be beat. This hotel is located on the East side of Midtown Manhattan. Close to Radio City, MOMA, Rockefeller Center, Top of the Rock, American Girl Place, Build a Bear and within a 10 minute walk of the Empire State Building and Times Square. A thirty minute walk will take you down to the Central Park Zoo. A little less time will take you to the park's playground, horse/carriage rides and FAO Schwartz (my daughter loved the floor piano -- think Tom Hanks in BIG). There are so many things to do at the park. On the East Side of the park, a little further down from the Zoo, is the petting zoo and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. On the West Side of the park (you will need to take a cab or walk for a bit) is the Museum of Natural History. Don't forget the Tavern on the Green, the castle and all the fabulous concerts and outdoor performances in the summer.We will definately stay here again next year, and hopfully for years to come, on our &quot;girls weekend&quot; in NYC. WE CAN'T WAIT!"
170,1969,"Mar 22 2009 	Wonderful 25th Wedding Anniversary Celebration	My husband and I celebrated our 25th Wedding Anniversary in Febuary at the Waldorf. After reading a few negative comments we were a bit apprehensive about what to expect. We shouldn't have worried. The staff were very friendly and couldn't have been more helpful. We had asked for an upgrade and received a room on the 27th floor with a corner view of Lexington and Park Avenues with an amazing view of the Chyrsler Building.We never ate in the hotel as it was too expensive, but found an excellent cafe around the corner for breakfast called Cafe Europe. All in all brilliant.One top tip, try and get tickets for the Rose Centre, sound and vision show in the Planetarium."
171,1969,"Mar 22 2009 	Doesn't live up to the name	I was very excited to spend my birthday in the City and stay at the renowned, Waldor. Well, to keep this brief, I would have been more impressed and gotten better value for my money staying at the Holiday Inn. First off, check-in was confusing and took too long. The elevators malfunctioned (had to go down to go back up). And worst of all the room, was not what we was expect. I get the appeal of old charm, but our room was just OLD and had a weird, musty smell. The tub backed up and we had to space showers so that the water could drain completely. To make matters worse, I was over charged...We compensated for our accomadations by spending absolutely no time there, we returned late and left as soon as we awoke.."
172,1969,"Mar 21 2009 	A little dusty but great location for the price	We were very excited to stay at the famed Waldorf on our trip to NYC but were definitely a little disappointed by the experience. The hotel had a very &quot;convention/tourist&quot; feel rather than the old world elegance we were expecting and the hotel as a whole was pretty dusty and tired feeling. Our room was a decent size for an NYC hotel but our view of the flat rooftop left a lot to be desired. The room was pretty clean though and the location to the 5th Avenue shops and Broadway can't be beat. Room service costs (for breakfast) were absolutely outrageous, even by NYC standards which was annoying."
173,1969,"Mar 20 2009 	Service much improved	I've stayed here a few times over the years, and always thought their service was pretty dismal. It would appear that someone has decided to remedy this. Was also pleased with a relatively large room -- stayed in the front of the hotel this time rather than towards the back. Rooms are clean and beds are comfy. My room only had a shower -- no big deal for me but I think a larger person would have difficulty fitting in the rather small space. If you like more space in which to shower in, suggest that you ask specifically for a bathtub."
174,1969,"Mar 19 2009 	Best avoided unless you are a VIP	The Waldorf obviously is a landmark hotel and its reputation is well deserved in most respects. Unfortunately, I find that the level of service and quality of room drops significantly if you lack celebrity status or your name is not prefaced by something like &quot;Senator&quot; or &quot;Ambassador.&quot; On recent trip, I was made to wait 2 hours beyond regular check-in time for my room after having registered early (but they were more than happy to hold my bag ... thanks for that). Then, I was told that I was &quot;upgraded&quot; to a SUPERIOR Room. Wow (thanks again). What I found was that my SUPERIOR Room was so small that I had to turn sideways in order to squeeze past certain spots, and the bed needed to be moved in order to unfold an ironing board. Calls to Guest Services were met with ambivalence. Simply not acceptable for a hotel of such stature. There is a W Hotel and a Doubletree directly across the street, likely better values for a stay in Mid-town."
175,1969,"Mar 18 2009 	Great hotel with great service	We took our daughter to New York to celebrate her birthday. We reserved a junior suite, but the hotel upgraded us to a full suite when they learned the occasion of the visit. It was a beautiful suite - a mini-apartment - with a great view of the cathedral. The staff was highly solicitous and the concierge was extremely knowledgable and very smooth. It was a great stay, and one that will be memorable for our family."
176,1969,"Mar 17 2009 	Charm and elegance	I must be a romantic but this hotel is just fantastic. The common areas are furnished and appointed exceptionally well. There is so much history here that it is hard to just walk through the lobby without feeling that you are in a special place that has seen a lot through the years. Our room was very comfortable and being on the 15th floor overlooking Park Avenue was perfect with very little street noise and only an occasional sound from the hallway. My only complaint was that we had called prior to arriving with some special instructions, and they had not been followed through prior to our arrival. We had to wait about an hour for our requests to be attended to. But that was our only issue during our 4 night stay. We will definitely stay here again."
177,1969,"Mar 15 2009 	Excellent hotel and great location	The hotel was in a great central location about 5-10 minutes walk to Times Square and 5th Avenue. Our room was on the 16th floor, the room was very spacious including a large dressing room and bathroom. Overall, we had a brilliant stay in New York City, the location of this hotel was brilliant for sight-seeing."
178,1969,Mar 14 2009 	Great stay...better than expected	First class stay. All the staff was very helpful from resturant reservations to theater reservations. Oyr room was just perfect...no complaints at all. Can't wait for our next visit
179,1969,"Mar 14 2009 	Art Deco opulence in an outstanding location	A wonderfully plush and equisite hotel with outstanding customer service. We were upgraded from a king concierge room to a corner room on the 34th floor of the Waldorf Towers. The view was fantastic across Manhattens' skyline but the room was a little shabby (flaking paint and an avocado bathroom suite!), however the view and the comfiness of the bed overrode this point. Breakfast was gorgeous, with delicious pastries, cream cheese and salmon bagels, yogurts, fruit and cereal served everyday."
180,1969,Mar 12 2009 	fantastic locationfriendly staffmost comfortable bed in the world	Arrived in new york for the first time in august and checked into the waldorf for not a lot more than no name hotels charge in poor locations.The staff are very friendly and eager to please.Our room wasnt ready on arrival so they gave us a free upgrade with a view of lexington avenue and a voucher to get some free drinks at the bar.We had to wait about an hour so we had a look around the hotels ballrooms and shops.The room was very nice as we had expected and the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept on.The maids came every day and did an excellent job.Unfortunately I didnt know til we got home that youre meant to leave a few dollars tip on pillow every day .Its a good idea to have a roll of dollar bills ready for tips to the staff who appreciate even for a buck.The location is perfect and I felt safe walking around surrounding area at midnight .I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone and hope to go back again one day.
181,1969,"Mar 11 2009 	Loved every minute of it	I had wanted to stay at the Waldorf since I was little. Further to this, we booked a 4 night stay this March for my 40th.Before I booked I read every single review on this site and made a note of what I did and did not want. In the end we booked a king mini suite. I made additional requests for a high floor, refurbished room with a nice view.We got there quite early due to a morning flight and were given some vouchers for drinks. At this point I asked if there was any chance of an upgrade and they said they would see what they could do. We spent a few fun hours in Harry's Bar and then went to check in. There were no ques and we were whisked into the 'Diamond Lounge' to formally check in. We were advised by a very nice lady that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to an Astor suite. A gentleman was summoned to take our bags to the room. I got over excited about the tipping and gave him $20. 5 minutes later he rang our door bell (yes door bell) and asked us to follow him to the 18th floor for a private tour of the ballroom and other grand meeting rooms. This was fab, a real treat. The rooms are amazing.Our room had a seperate parlour and bedroom and an enourmous marble bathroom with seperate bath and shower. It was a really cosy room which my husband said was like a 'little flat' all of our own. We were on the 19th floor and had fantastic views from 4 windows of Lexington Avenue and Manhattan. It snowed while we were there an it was amazing to see from our room.We paid $279 per night for the room. Including 1 room service breakfast, a room service dinner, a shoe shine (had to try it) and 4 budweisers ($50.50 but on ice with their own table!), our whole bill came to about $1500.Allot of money but when you look at the quality and size of the room, the level of service and the location, then compare it to the prices of other 'posh' NYC hotels, it isn't half bad.I loved the whole experience. Please don't even bother staying here if your main priority is a wide screen telly and wifi. Do stay however if you fancy being sent back in time to a more elegant and classy era.Another tip. Don't book on line. Phone the hotel direct and speak to a real person, then be very clear aboout what you do and don't expect. Booking on lne is more of a lottery."
182,1969,Mar 10 2009 	great place to stay	My wife always wanted to stay in Waldorf Astoria. It lived it's expectations!! marvelous place!!we will be back!
183,1969,"Mar 9 2009 	Excellent Service	We have stayed at the Waldorf several times over the past years and have always enjoyed our stay - this time we returned to the Waldorf after a couple years absence and were impressed by the increased level of service and efficiency - all given by genuinely friendly, competent personnel. All members of the staff: the doorman, valet, bellhop, check-in person, room service, maintenance, waiters at both Bull &amp; Bear and Peacock Alley made us feel like we were the most important people staying at the hotel and I observed that this level of service seemed to be the norm.Although the Waldorf was fully booked, we never had to wait or ask for anything - check-in went very smoothly - we were escorted to our room and the luggage arrived immediately, as soon as we stepped outside we were asked if we needed a taxi and it was promptly hailed, as soon as we arrived to one of the hotel's restaurants we were immediately greeted and shown to our table, the server came to our table instantly and continued to provide excellent service, each call to guest services for a request had someone at our room within minutes - even getting our car at the end of our stay - Biden was arriving as we were leaving so the cars were being delayed but the staff was wonderful and very responsive to the guests - we relaxed in a lounge area of the hotel and when we returned to get our car, it was waiting with a couple people helping to load the luggage, open car doors, etc. - and, it was extremely busy at this time.Again, all the staff were genuinely warm, friendly and extremely efficient. Everything seemed to go perfectly, we did not have to &quot;think&quot; it was so seemless. The Waldorf is an older, historic property and there are some things about the Waldorf that probably would be helpful to know:- During all my stays, there has never been a coffee maker in the room, I have speculated on reasons - building construct and codes, etc., but have never found out for certain. However, we called room service and asked if they would deliver a hot pot and a variety of tea bags for our stay - we paid a very minimal charge and these items were delivered promptly.- Rooms appear to be continually renovated. Also, there is a great variety of room types and the floorplans on each floor vary. I always note that I would like a renovated room when making a reservation and repeat the request upon check-in. I have always received wonderful rooms. Each room appears uniquely decorated and this time we stayed in a beautiful one-bedroom suite that definitely had an elegant, warm, &quot;home&quot; feeling rather than a cookie-cutter hotel room feel.- As with any hotel, there may be maintenance issues, but the staff responds immediately and expertly if you mention it. We had one of the heaters in the living room giving off cold air, no heat. We called guest services, a maintenance person arrived within 5 mins, explained that a new part was needed but rather than have us wait, he called housekeeping for an electric heater. This arrived in 5 mins - a brand new, quiet, tower style heater. Then, when we returned from our activities there was a message from the manager to check that everything was ok and to please call if we need anything else.- Bathroom amenities, etc. - if you need anything else by way of bathroom amenities, a phone call to guest services has it delivered promptly.- Turn down service - the hotel services directory notes that you should call if you would like turn down service, we called the first day to request it and it was provided consistently throughout our stay.- It has been my experience that management at the Waldorf responds to comments or issues immediately and does their best to ensure that things are resolved during a stay. We had an excellent stay at the Waldorf and, if it were possible to transport the Waldorf staff to every hotel I stay at, I would."
184,1969,"Mar 7 2009 	Nice hotel with great Park Avenue location.	I've stayed at this hotel several times and every time I ahve had a very different room. My favorite is the Towers room as I was given this time. While not as spacious as other rooms I ahve stayed in, it did have sevral lttle upgrades tha made it feel nicer. Service is good, about what you would expect from any Hilton. It has a nicely recently re-done fitness room that I got to enjoy for free because of my VIP Hhonors status; it wold not have been worth it if I had had to pay for it."
185,1969,"Mar 6 2009 	Great Staff and Atmosphere - But Average Guest Rooms	We loved the Waldorf, mostly because of the high level of service and the wonderful public rooms. But our guestroom was a bit small and needed some TLC and the bed was only average. The prices for dining are very high. Overall a tremendous experience but not one that we would repeat over and over again."
186,1969,"Mar 5 2009 	Paying for the name. Rooms were of an average standard extremely professional but nothing special	Although a fabulous lobby and ground floor of the hotel, the actual experience itself was nothing to write home about, rooms were average for the city and the noise outside was not blocked out by the windows. President Bush happened to be staying when we were here, i just hope he had a more impressive room than i did!! Im sure if youre willing to pay alot then there is fantastic rooms, but i would go elsewhere if you just want to stay at a reasonably priced, good hotel."
187,1969,"Mar 2 2009 	3 Star room in 5 star hotel	The lock on the bathroom door didn't work at all, the bathroom door handle flopped around. The door paint was well overdue for TLC. I would echo several other comments about hot water taking ages to arrive at the bath/shower. The next day we spoke to reception about the faulty lock and they moved us to a slightly larger room. Solution -- complain ASAP. The second room was 1302 and suffered from some street noise, but tolerable. Same problem as the 12th floor room with poor hot water supply. We loved the hotel's ambiance but at the end of the day your room is the major factor and the 1st room was 3 star and the 2nd room was 4 star."
188,1969,Mar 2 2009 	Unforgettable stay	I visited New York at the end of February with a friend for a three night stay at the Waldorf Astoria. Upon arrival at check-in we were ignored by the majority of the desk clerks but a charming lady called Monika smiled at us and welcomed us to the hotel and indulging me by not laughing at my faltering few words of Polish (she could speak flawless English by the way). We stayed in a lovely double/double room with separate dressing room and bathroom on the 17th floor overlooking Park Avenue (and consequently further away from the traffic noise which was a definite bonus). I have visited New York twice in the past and stayed in rooms the size of a shoe box so it was a definite bonus to be so well accommodated. I wouldn't say the room was spotless or perfectly decorated but it had a certain elegance and charm which you rarely find. All in all worth every penny. I would definitely stay here again.
189,1969,"Feb 24 2009 	A legend shows its age	I had heard miraculous stories about the Waldorf, so when my company agreed to put me up there I was thrilled. The thrill was short lived as I experienced a real disappointment.The Waldorf has well sized rooms that are tastefully decorated and of course has a good location in New York City, but I found it shabby and somewhat in disrepair. My room was also noisy and I had hairs on my pillows. Of course for a legend you pay high prices, which was not a problem on my company's dollar - but I would never go here on my own bank account."
190,1969,"Feb 19 2009 	Consistency is a serious problem	If you want to stay at the Waldorf go ahead, but do not expect it to be better than other places you could choose. I travel for business all the time and need a good fitness center and a nice salad from room service at night. Fitness Center: First night there was no attendant but water, fruit and towels were plentiful. Second night there was an attendant at the beginning and when she left she left water and fruit on the counter. Third night there was an attendant at the beginning but when she left she put away the water and left fruit. Fourth night the attendant put away the water and fruit. Now, isn't this the Waldorf Astoria? There are hardly any people using the fitness center at night. Is it too expensive to provide bottled water and fruit for people using the fitness center.Room service: I order a chicken ceasar salad, dressing on the side, whole grain rolls every night. I am going into the detail so you will understand that my order is so consistent when I travel that it never changes, the food I received was all over the board. First night I received the salad and no whole grain rolls/bread. Second night I received the salad and whole wheat toast. Third night I received the salad but without parmesan cheese slivers, and the whole wheat toast. Fourth night I received the same thing as the third night but was charged $8.00 for the whole grain toast.Overall: When you travel all the time consistency is key. Just didn't feel that here. If you want to stay here once, go ahead and roll the dice. If you want to be sure of service, you might need to look elsewhere. Plus side: The check-in staff was great. The staff in the lobby to answer questions was great. My room was not as clean as it should have been the first night (vacuuming was poor) but after that it was clean and the room was always well stocked with towels, shampoo, etc. Hall noise was minimal to nonexistent. Cons: Consistency. TV choices: No travel channel, food channel, etc. Just the basic networks plus middle eastern channels. No Fox News if you like that choice - MSNBC and CNN related choices only."
191,1969,"Feb 18 2009 	Fabulous history and main areas. Lacked little touches.	Pro'sBeautiful building.Great location.Fantastic public areas.Cannot fail to feel the history of the building.Clean.Professional.We were upgraded by one room category even though the hotel was full.Con'sNo shower gel in rooms - only soap!No Bathrobes or slippers.Erratic turndown service (1 night in 4)No tea or coffee making facilities.No duvet covers only 2 sheets with a duvet in between - very strange!We stayed over our 1st anniversary and Valentine's Day and there were no little touches to celebrate this - choccies etc. as experienced in many other hotels of this quality and expense in other major cities in the world.If visiting New York again we would not choose the Waldorf, but are glad however to have experienced the history of this magnificent building."
192,1969,"Feb 17 2009 	Beautiful hotel issues with service	My wife and I stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria for two nights in late January 2009. We made our reservation through American Express for a room listed as 1 King Bed Concierge Level. The Waldorf had always been a hotel I wished to stay in so I was excited about the visit.The hotel is truly magnificent. Staying there really takes one back to a time when a visit to a hotel was an EVENT, not something we do simply as a necessity. I was taken thinking of how my parents or grandparents would have felt as a guest there, and how much the hotel has changed in the past century, but how little (overall) the Waldorf had managed to retain the grand charm of days long past. If for no other reason than connecting with history, staying in the Waldorf is an experience one must do at some point in their life.The room we were given was in the Waldorf Towers and we were very pleased with the room overall. The size was exceptionally large for a New York hotel room. In addition to the main bedroom, there was an entry foyer, a kitchenette area, a dressing area, and a very large bathroom. The fixtures were a nice blend of old and modern, from the trio of closets to the multi-jetted shower. The condition of the room was excellent and all the linens and amenities were of superior levels. The view was a decent view down Park Avenue but nothing postcard worthy.The Concierge Level lounge provided a very nice continental breakfast each morning in a private room. The quality of the food and the selection were excellent, even if you had only a moment to grab a coffee to go. The staff in this area did a nice job of helping with most all requests. The area is small though, so dont be shocked if you have to wait a few moments for a table.The main amenities of the hotel are all superior. The fitness facility is very modern and well thought out, even providing guests with fitness gear in case you have left yours at home. The concierge is most helpful, providing good information and reviews on local restaurants. The shops and business center are well done and very convenient. And the location of the hotel is hard to beat.My main complaint with the hotel is one of attitude towards guests who are younger than, say, 50 or 60 years. Although they were always polite, the staff seemed to be uncomfortable dealing with my wife and I (both in our 30s but looking much more like two people in their 20s). From the front desk to the bell attendants, there seemed to be this underlying sentiment of are you sure you are old enough to be staying here? whenever we dealt with staff members. Given that we are polite, courteous and professional people, it caught us very off guard. Overall, this is a fine hotel and well worth a visit. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those over the age of 40."
193,1969,"Feb 16 2009 	Phenomenal Experience	Came to NYC for the very first time with all of the women in my very southern family. We shopped, toured, ate amazing food, and stayed in this breath-taking establishment. The staff were beyond helpful, offering umbrellas and curbside cab-call. Everything was top of the line. We ate breakfast 2 mornings in the restaurant downstairs. The Starbucks Shop was nice enough to stay open an extra half-hour per our request because it was rainy and cold, we needed warm coffee!! Would most certainly recommend this to any and everyone wanting to visit the beautiful big apple. A+++"
194,1969,Feb 16 2009	Horrible Service!	We went to the bar at the Waldorf for drinks after the Opera and no one even looked at us for 10 minutes! The bar had horrible service and was not even busy..... I will never go back!
195,1969,"Feb 6 2009 	W-A better than many reviews	I was rather nervous about staying at the famous Waldorf-Astoria after reading a number of negative reviews on various web sites. But, I had the Hilton Honors points, and there was a discount sale making it no more points than the Hilton Hotel several blocks away. So, I opted for the W-A. Frankly, this is an old, prestigious hotel, and I wanted to experience the art deco building and style.Check-In: More clerks than guests, so I walked right up at about 4pm. Pleasant clerk took my check-in, and said that I had been upgraded. Nice. Asked several times if there was anything he could do for me, anything I wanted to know. Nice attitude.Room: For NY, this was a LARGE room. Big King bed, huge desk, flat screen TV, mini-bar, two large windows (alas, overlooking a rooftop of another section of the hotel, but you can't have everything - if I looked sideways, I could see the street). Furniture was traditional style, and very fine. No wear and tear. Bathroom was good sized, black and white marble, exquisite fixtures in art deco style.Amenities: everything worked well, including the heat controls, and the maid did the room early each morning. Just fine. Newspaper every morning.General: Elevators are on key-card after 6pm for security, and they were FAST. Lobby is fantastic. The entire hotel is beautiful and kept up well. There were employees everywhere asking to help. The concierge was helpful, printed my boarding pass for the return flight without charge. Room service was expensive, so I left it out. No coffee maker, but I suppose that was an economy measure. Starbucks is in the hotel. Lower lobby. So, why bother?All-in-all, it was a very delightful stay. Room was great, checkout was swift. Internet in the lobby is free; in the room it is a charge. No problem sitting in the lobby accessing the net. Others did it too. Enjoyed seeing Cole Porter's piano in the Cocktail Lounge. And, I felt like a rich Master of the Universe, for only 120,000 points. The room is certainly worth the money - the location is great, the service is excellent, and the art deco furnishings and architecture are fabulous. A landmark it is. They had pictures of famous guests everywhere, but I was never able to figure out why Hermione Gingold was relegated to the Men's Room."
196,1969,"Feb 3 2009 	Beautiful hotel - but dissapointed with room size	Great hotel, fab and spacious lobby, tiny rooms for the price and found the beds very uncomfortable and killed my back but they did bring me a plank to put under the mattrass to make firmer - so the service was great!The sheets were lovley - finest egyption cotton which certainly helps.Location good but would have prefered times square as it's quite isolated and a few blocks up from central park. Really enjoyable although a bit uptight for my liking - I like 5 star without the snobbery attached! :-)"
197,1969,"Feb 3 2009 	As expected...	Ok, just back 4 night stay. After reading the reviews on the site, I had lowered my expectations somewhat about what to expect and I was neither hugely dissapointed or 'wowed'.First off - I did want to stay here as I was going with my brothers and parents and it is somewhere we have always wanted to go.The lobby is magnificant really opulant and I love that, we had no problems checking in, we all arrived separately and they accomodated an early check in as my brother was arriving first.The rooms where v small, which I was prepared for, however three of us where staying in a room with 2 double beds and there where 4 small drawers in total + a wardrobe for hanging, so we ended up just living out of our suitcases.Bathroom was tiny, but functional, we only used our rooms for sleeping and cleaning, so size wasn't getting us down.We had breakfast in the hotel in the morning (Peacock Alley - Oscars was shut during our stay) - cost was outrageous, I don't care how affluent you are, this was too much. Also having to pay to use the gym on top is bizarre I think.In summary, I found that other reviews lowered my expectations in terms of the rooms, however it was definately a dissapointment on my original impressions of how it would be.Lobby aside, the whole place is just a little too tired for my taste.Did I enjoy it - yes, as a one off with my parents and brothers, but would I go back again with my wife and kids - no.It was ok, but not worth it. I think we could do better."
198,1969,"Jan 27 2009	loved this amazing hotel	we have just arrived back from our 5 day break at the waldorf astoria&amp;after reading alot of the reviews on how unhappy peaple were with their rooms,i was a bit concerned!When we arrived,straight away our bags were taken care of by the doormen,while we checked ourselves in.The hotel is huge&amp;very elegant.We arrived at 2pm and were given our room keys almost immediatley.We just booked the standard king room and we were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful it was.Very spacious,huge bed,desk,fab mirrored wardrobes,very beautiful marble bathroom with huge shower,bathrobes,hairdryer,minibar ipod station and immaculatley clean!we had a huge window with a view of park avenue.We were very pleased.It was my husbands 40th birthday and had a very exclusive box of waldorf chocolates&amp; white rose left in our room which i thought was a lovely surprise.Hotel bars &amp; restaurants are very expensive.Didnt eat at hotel so cannot comment on the food.There are alot of business and money peaple stay at this hotel but all the same we felt very comfortable around them,When we went to plaza hotel for a look around we felt very uncomfortable and out of our league.The waldorf is very central 2 everything,it is in a great midtown position.Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone considering it.I give this hotel 10/10"
199,1969,"Jan 24 2009 	A complete and utter disappointment	In early August 2008, having arrived at La Guardia from LA X, the last thing you'd want to do is arrive in a stuffy indoor car park and wait there for about half an hour whilst a member of staff gives you the look of death for not tipping him! This kind of sums up the experience. The moment my family and I arrived we were very disappointed. Service was rubbish-we waited at the reception desk for about 45 minutes whilst people buzzed around EVERYWHERE. I was personally upset upon arrival to my room. It smelled of urine and smoke, the bathroom was appallingly tiny and the toilet failed to flush. It was a good summary of the Waldorf experience. Come dinner time on the first night, we were waiting for about an hour for some disappointing food which should have taken about half an hour maximum. The waiter had an attitude problem and felt the need to correct a jet-lagged and disorientated yours truly for pronouncing a dish wrong. Breakfast was fun, though (NOT). It was worse than waiting in a long queue at the supermarket. Whole groups of tourists gathered around our table to talk to friends sitting at other tables, taking photos and in general disturbing most people trying to eat their breakfast. Often, the queue for breakfast was so long that it extended up the stairs which lead to the room itself. To have an enjoyable breakfast you'd probably have to be down there by 6am.After two dreadful nights, we left the Waldorf Astoria and I honestly could not have been happier to find a haven in the form of &quot;Le Parker Meridien&quot;. Not only was it less teeming with people, the staff were friendly, the rooms beautiful and modern and the service impeccable.This is a plea to anyone thinking of going to the Waldorf. Don't go! It thrives on reputation alone and is as tired and frankly dead as the film stars of the past who resided there from time to time."
200,1969,"Jan 20 2009 	Great Hotel Experience	We stayed at this hotel from January 16 to January 18 using Hilton Honors Awards. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a corner luxury suite. And my what a wonderful suite it was! The room was about 700 square feet with a foyer and a coat closet by the entrance door which leads to a luxurious living room. The room has an executive desk, and a view of Park Avenue. Bedroom is separated from the living room and has a walk-in closet. The bathroom is all marble with a deep bath tub. We didn't have any problem with the water or room temperature. They provided a turn down service at night time.We had an opportunity to eat at the Peacock Alley for brunch. If you have a chance, one should try it even once in a lifetime. The buffet was great with wide variety of food such as oysters, clams, lobsters, chocolate fundue, crabs, shrimps, brioche, pancakes, crepes, and so much more.The gym on the 5th floor is adequate and open for 24 hours. We were told the spa on the 19th floor also has a gym but smaller than the one on the 5th floor.This hotel is great. The staff are courteous and polite. The location is wonderful. We really enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to return to Waldorf Astoria upon our return in Manhattan."
201,1969,"Jan 18 2009 	OOOOPS Living on past glories!	I took my wife to New York for our 40th Wedding Anniversary so where did I think would be swish and, although expensive, well worth it!? Well the Waldorf Astoria ofcourse. The Queen stayed there afterall, it MUST be good. Booked the flight and the hotel over the internet and although it cost me an arm and a leg thought 40th Wedding Anniversary I'll surprise and delight her!!Well WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!! 'Fraid I was somewhat embarassed because quite frankly the room was NOT of the standard I would have expected, there was no robes and no tea or coffee making facilities and the net curtains looked like they hadn't been washed in ten years (her words not mine I hasten to add). Sorry but it took the edge off our holiday and I most certainly would not recommend the Waldorf to any of my friends, acquaintances or anybody else for that matter. The Foyer is brilliant but it would seem that that is all they've refurbished and the rest of the hotel is fraying around the edges if our room is anything to go by."
202,1969,"Jan 14 2009 	Nice experience	It was a nice experience to stay at the Waldorf given the history of the hotel. While the hotel room was a bit small and dated, the hotel has wonderful ambiance. It was great to have tried the hotel, but it's very expensive for what you get. While there are many better choices in NYC, it's worth staying at the Fairmont at least once in your life. No regrets."
203,1969,Jan 13 2009 	Average Hotel	Hotel did not have our room ready until 5:00pm and check in time was 3:00. There was no one at the diamond reservation desk.The room was above average but a little on the small side. Most of the staff were friendly.
204,1969,"Jan 10 2009 	Good and Bad	I booked this hotel with Hilton HHonors points and was really looking forward to a great stay at a classic New York City establishment for part of my mom's birthday surprise.We drove down from Westchester without any traffic and after bringing our car to the valet (initially $65/day, but turned out to be $50), we found our way up to the front desk for check-in. I couldn't believe that the long line in front of us was for check-in, so I double-checked with the concierge. Yep, check-in...50 very TEDIOUS minutes later, we were finally at the desk. While watching dozens of people (read: tourists) babble on with the front desk clerks and most likely ask questions about where to go and what to do while in NYC, I was beyond infuriated. The man who checked us in could not have been nicer. He was incredibly pleasant after what must have been a long, trying day for him. He offered us information about the hotel while our reservation was processing and also offered me 1,000 Hilton points to &quot;reward&quot; me for my long wait time. Very much appreciated.The room was exactly as I expected: old school, fancy hotel room with that New York charm I was hoping for. My mom, who loves fancy, classic things, was overjoyed.Overall, the stay was lovely in spite of the mobs of tourists. If you are a New Yorker and choose to stay here, bring your patience. You'll need it; think Times Square crammed into a hotel..."
205,1969,"Jan 8 2009 	How can they get away with this ?!	I stayed at the Waldorf last year ago and found the experience quite disappointing then, however I decided to put my concerns aside as I returned with my friend and daughter who really wanted to stay there. We arrived after a long journey from the UK at around 4am UK time. There seemed to be various altercations going on at the check in desk with other guests, but we were basically told that the hotel was overbooked and that we were being sent to a Hilton 10 blocks away. We were handed $10 to pay for the cab ( which we were expected to sort out for ourselves ). When I eventually got to see the manager I was told that everyone checking in that night had to do the same and that she would send me a voucher for a return free 2 night stay. I had no choice but to accept this, my daughter was in tears as she had been so excited to stay at The Famous Waldorf, and basically it ruined our trip. To cap it all, 4 weeks have gone by and I have received no voucher or communication. I think this is pretty disgraceful and I would never stay here again. Go to The Sofitel...I stayed there last year and it was wonderful with service like it should be."
206,1969,"Jan 8 2009	Lied To!	On Oct 23rd 2008 I booked a 2 room Concierge level suite at a very good negotiated rate of $399+taxes.I was concerned when the E mail confirmation said &quot;King Bed Concierge Level&quot;I phoned and questioned this and I was told,&quot;Don't worry Sir that's only the way it prints out,your reservation is for a suite as discussed&quot;.On the7th of Jan I recieved an E mail offering me cut price upgrades and when I investigated found that the suite was an upgrade being offered to me.I phoned the Waldorf and spoke to them without rancour as they'd obviously made a mistake.No mistake,they wanted an extra $150 per night.I pointed out that the $399 rate was actually above their rate for a king bed concierge level available on the internet but they wouldn't budge.I've cancelled and have achieved a very good deal at the Sofitel which I will report on later."
207,1969,"Jan 7 2009 	A classic beauty	The main entry reflects elegance of a time gone by.We are Hilton Diamond members and used a Hilton Award to celebrate a special anniversary. Our room was a newly renovated corner room on a lower floor. The heating system worked perfectly. The room had a large boudoir adjacent to the well sized bedroom. The bathroom was a marble studded gem. The location of the Waldorf is perfect for touring NYC. The theater district, MOMA and 5th Ave shopping are located close enough for a walk or a quick cab ride.Oscars, a wonderful breakfast place on the lower floor of the hotel, is no longer a perks for Diamond or Gold members. The Starbucks is the new breakfast benefit. Starbucks is located at the base of the hotel. It is very good, but you have to bring the food into the hotel if you want to sit down to have breakfast.Sir Harry's bar is a cozy place to go for drinks. You can order champagne by the glass. The Diamond desk has a staffing problem. This is the second time this year we have had excessive waits to get registered. If someone at the Diamond desk has a problem the staff does not alert the hotel management that additional help is needed to take care of Diamond members. Once we did get to our beautiful room we were pleased. The house keeping staff does a beautiful job of keeping it clean. They were exceptionally friendly and courteous."
208,1969,"Jan 7 2009 	Better to visit than stay	My husband booked a surprise three night stay in NYC at the Waldorf for the pair of us. The hotel is breathtaking upon entrance and definitely worth a look around as it is beautiful with regards to bars/restaurants/lobby etc etc. However the rooms were disappointing. Whilst I appreciate the hotel is old, the room we were given was very small and 'faded' even though we had paid to upgrade. In addition we were right next to the service area which was very noisy at 5.30am! We requested a move but having arrived Xmas night were told the hotel was full and would be offered a better room the next day at 3pm. We returned to move our things at this time and were disappointed to find our room not ready so had to hang around until it was, which was a bit annoying as we only returned to the hotel to move things and thought we could freshen up and have a rest but c ould not do this as we were 'in limbo' between rooms. We were then given a better room and yes it was in a nicer part of the building ie quieter and yes bigger in size but pretty much the same in the way of 'tiredness' of the room if that makes sense! Overall I loved New York and this did not spoil our stay but certainly wouldn't pay the money my husband did to stay there again when there are cheaper hotels with much better accommodation in New York from what I have seen/heard .(This was my fifth trip to NYC) Make the time to visit the Waldorf and even have a drink in Harry's bar (albeit very expensive I had the best Apple Martini I have ever had!!) its worth a trip but treat it more as a museum to visit rather than somewhere to choose to stay."
209,1969,"Jan 2 2009 	A retrospective of 5 stays	In the last decade my wife and I have stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria 5 sepatate times, each during Christmas week. We have experienced accomodation categories from an executive room in the Towers to a king one-bedroom suite in the main hotel. Much to my surprise, we have never been recognized as repeat clients when checking in. In some other hotels we have frequented, the better rooms are routinely given to returning clients. This has not been our experience at the Waldorf. Overall, we have never had an unacceptable experience (by our standards). Our one stay in the Towers is remembered mostly for the rude and unhelpful Towers staff. Our room expereinces in the main hotel have been hit-and-miss with both postives and negatives. In terms of the rooms alone, our best experience was being assigned a corner suite on a high floor. This suite was very spacious and the basic decor was classic. Yet, some of the furniture was broken and (in the bedroom) the backs were literally falling off both nightstands. The wall paper in the parlor was waterstained and bubbled around a window. I mention this case specifically because this is very typical of our 5 Waldorf expereinces--a mix of postiives and negatives that some will find acceptable (or at least tolerable) and others will judge totally unacceptable.This past year (2008) we had a Lexington Ave side king- suite--significantly smaller than the corner mentioned above but overall better appointed and in better condition. A few oddities with the bathroom plumbing and a large entertainment console that did not fit well in the parlor. Quite noisy at times due to Lex Ave emergency vehicles and garbage trucks. That mix again.The queen Astor suites in the Lexington Ave side of the hotel were redecorated a few years ago and overall I would expect these suites to be in better condition than others. Early on we had a mini-suite with an excellent bed but otherwise in need of furniture replacement--topped off by 2 bathrooms and a great view of the St. Barts dome across 50th street. Always a mixed experience.Over the years we have found the reception and housekeeping staffs to be polite and willing to help when asked. As I am a native New Yorker, we have never used the concierge staff. At present, it appears that occupancy is down (hotel was significantly less busy that in previous years)and staff reductions have already occurred. A problem in the making--not sure.So why then have we returned on numerous occassions? The main reason is that we have had mostly good times at the Waldorf, in large part because we have been able to enjoy the positives and put the negatives aside. In many ways this is a great classic hotel. In terms of cost, the suites have been nicely priced in late Dec. (relative to many other hotels). As others have frequently mentioned, the public spaces are magnificent. I started this review with a bit of a negative tone because I think that one should be aware of the Waldorf experience. Given that, I have rated the hotel above average overall as this is how we judge our collective experience with this hotel. As this forum indicates, many others have a different view. I have no reason to think that the general situation sketched out above will change for the bettter or for the worse. If you like modern and impeccably appointed hotels look elsewhere. If you are comfortable with history, classic decor, and flexible on many little details you may well enjoy a stay at the Waldorf. I believe that no two rooms/suites are the same, so you are in part dependent on the luck of the draw as far as accomodations are concerned. Will we return?--haven't decided yet.h"
210,1969,"Jan 1 2009 	unforgettable holiday	we stayed at the Waldorf for Christmas, what a great expierence. I did have some concerns after reading some of the negative comments from other travelers, who had stayed at the Waldorf. All I can say is I don't see how any one can stay in this Historic Hotel with has such an elegant appeal to it, and not be happy. Our room was ready on arrival and it was spotless, it was much larger than I was expecting and the bed was very comfortable. The maids came in daily and did an excellent job. The concierge staff were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We had a room on the 17th floor as we had requested a smoking room, not much of a view but we weren't expecting one, its New York. The people of the city were very helpful, we even had our photo taken on a policemans Harley Davidson. We did not eat in the hotel as there are so many Delis that serve excellent food at a fraction of the cost, I can highly recomend Scottys Diner on Lexington Avenue, wonderful food with a great service. We decided to spend our money in Maceys. What a shop so easy to get lost. Iceskating at the Rockafella Center looked rather small so we went to Central Park, the rink was much bigger and less busy. A helpful tip, if you want to go to the Empire State building get there early, we went straight up at 9.a.m, by 10a.m. the queue was going round the block. I would recomend this beautiful hotel to all of my friends and I could not find fault with a single thing."
211,1969,"Dec 31 2008	Great Time In NY 	1st time in NY and booked at The Waldorf. Staff were excellent. The porters were very helpful and friendly, the cocktail bar man advised us a couple of places to eat ('I eat there with my family') and we were not disappointed. Our stay was great, the hotel is beautiful and has kept its old charm. Its not the cheapest but what a nice place to stay and the area was very business like and not overly populated with tourists (us). Remember any room you book in manhattan will be small unless you are paying a fortune so don't expect huge rooms, but again the time you spend in there is asleep anyway. The hotel was great and I would stay again and recommend. It was our first visit to NY and the hotel and its staff made us very welcome."
212,1969,"Dec 29 2008 	Not what you would expect	When you first walk in the lobby is fabulous. The room, however, was a disappointment. Understanding the age of the hotel I expected small rooms (ours was one of the few with a King bed) but the room had none of the amenities you would expect for $389 per night. No robes, a small tv, no thermostat to control temp (we had to open the window frequently to keep the temperature from being uncomfortably hot). Decor was also a dissapointment. the bar was nice, and Sonny was a great bartender. Sandy (waitress) on the other had consistently complained about her job in front of customers, and always had a scowl on her face. Getting change for cab fare was next to impossible as the line for guest services was frequently quite long (10 minutes).Concierge service was unimaginative to say the least. they couldn't recommend restaurants new the Waldorf open past 10pm on two requests. (City that never sleeps?)The Sunday brunch was ok (but at $95 per person you would expect more) and the Bull and Bear turned out an acceptable steak, but pale in comparison to Del Friscos just down the street.All in all, we won't stay at the Waldorf again."
213,1969,"Dec 28 2008	As sad state of affairs	Unbelievably awful and depressing. Used to be a grand dame of hotels in NY, now is like any crappy Hilton. We had to wait 40 minutes behind ropes to register, las vegas style because there was a mob scene and the hotel decided to have 4 desks open. The lobby had been converted to a crappy las vegas style buffet, so the mob had to stand beside the steam trays and wilting roast beefs. The hotel seems to service hoards of tourists and is about pushing people in and out. The room was not as pictured/described at all. The &quot;one bedroom suite&quot; was a cramped, shoddy, depressing room that looked out at a brick wall. The bathtub drain didn't work, the temp controller was broken so the room was insufferably hot. There is no free wireless, like there is in any mcdonalds or red roof inn. It is a crowded, touristy, depressing hellhole with outrageous prices. Sad, this used to be a gorgeous and lovely hotel. Whomever ruined this hotel should be ashamed of themselves."
214,1969,"Dec 22 2008 	Like staying at Grandma's - but she doesn't love you any more.	I travel to NY for business a good bit. I was spending a quick weekend for pre-xmas NY enjoyment and wanted to use some Hilton points. I saw I could book the fabled Waldorf Astoria - why not? I knew it was a bit of a gamble but figured the location was right, plus I didn't require much, and when else would I get to check it out?It went fine. It was what we needed. The location was indeed very good. The room was good enough. If I had paid $ I would have been very disappointed. It was like a best western I guess.. except I think those have had to keep up with the 1990s at a minimum. I can't think of much to compare it to. Old school vegas, maybe. Think freemont street. Frozen in time. Everything is a bit musty and dank. If they built it today and used that styling you might call it retro and give it a good laugh. When it is actual items from the 60s, however, they are a bit grimy and dirty. The rooms are full of carpet and oldness. There is a massive draft through the poorly sealed 1954 window. The temperature controls are pretty shoddy. Think motel 6. There are 600 uniformed employees to watch you as you walk around the hallways... there are large chandeliers... these things are all true - note them if they are what you are into. The mini bar doesn't autodetect what you take. If you are really lucky they will give you some COUPONS for free tiny bottles of water from the mini bar. They will instruct you to place these COUPONS in the minifridge in lieu of the water.. really... 1984-style. It is a riot. The showerhead literally has a font from a beatles album on it. Neat... but.. not very good for showering.The business center literally has FLOPPY DISKS for sale. I kid you not. I heard them tell someone they could lend him a charger for his laptop - $50/day. Funny stuff. Wifi? You gotta be kidding... nothing close. Lucky you have power. 2-prong power. No ground plug. I can't believe they had mag cards now that I think of it - I would have expected a bunch of skeleton keys handed out at the front desk. Kiosk checkin? HAHAHAHA. No way. Oh it gets better... We get a PERK.. free breakfast! After the checkin person mentioned 2 restaurants that would honor this, they backtracked in apparent embarrassment when the printed vouched stipulated the 'breakfast' was at.. STARBUCKS. Yup... one cookie and a coffee. Out of control with oldschool old-fashioned cheapness that seems ignorant of all the real hotels with customer service dotting the city.Oh yeah... went for a run. Wanted a hot tub. Called around and inquired about having one at the gym... no.. maybe the spa?... no... nowhere. No hot tub in the entire palace. Ok.In sum, this is without a doubt the worst hotel I've stayed at in years - and certainly in New York. It should definitely be demolished and replaced with something useful. It still exists for the same reasons as racism and The Varsity restaurant in Atlanta - sometimes people value 'tradition' over any actual quality/benefit.Don't stay here."
215,1969,"Dec 15 2008 	Best hotel in New York!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Myself and my husband were due to go to New York 4th Dec 2008 for 5 nights we had booked a hotel through expedia a bog standard 2 star property however upon arrival I found that my darling husband had secretly changed our hotel to the Waldorf to my absolute delight!!!! Bless him, it was a surprise xmas gift as he knows I have always wanted to stay there as I thinks its so new york!!! The hotel is amazing so luxurious and gorgeous and our room was lovely. The hotel is always busy and full with people and there is always something going on such as an awards ceremony or a wedding etc so very posh!!! The hotel is in such a great location and we found it easy enough to get everywhere from there. Very very very busy in New York in december never seen anything like it shopping was just a complete nightmare as you had to que to get in everywere so maybe I wouldnt reccommend dec as too busy but then on the other hand you wouldnt see all the fabulous xmas decorations and lights which we just unbelievable! all in all a brilliant hotel and we thought why the hell not as to us we probably wouldnt visit new york again so we wanted it to be special!"
216,1969,"Dec 11 2008 	Great place for three-generation New York vacation	We took a three-generation July 4th trip to NYC, and just had to stay at the Waldorf because it is SO New York, and also because it was the only hotel my father would stay at, except the Plaza and they were closed for renovation. The oldsters where thrilled with the hotel, accommodations, food, service. The teens and pre-teens found endless wonders daily in and around the hotel. And those of us in the middle were happily just a few blocks from Bloomingdale's. All of our rooms were really large and seemed brand new in a New York old-money kind of way, which was unexpected but great. From the doormen in front who would get you a limo or cab in a blink, to the glorious, glorious lobby bouquet, to the stiffly-press bellman, to the front-desk staff that seemed to belong at the UN as much as at a hotel front desk... it was perfect New York. I was a little concerned about staying right in the middle of midtown on a trip like that, but it was a great location, with all the flavor and comfort that we wanted."
217,1969,"Dec 10 2008	Park Avenue's Historic Hotel	I had not stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria since 2002 so I was interested to see if anything had changed at the hotel. The service at the hotel is excellent and the breakfasts' that I ate at the restaurant &quot;Oscar's&quot; were very good as well. Check-in was swift. The only complaint was that the first night I was supposed to have a suite and my room was located near an elevator shaft and I heard it making a noise all night. This room was on the 22nd floor. I was moved to another room after I let the staff know about the noise which was much quieter- however, it was not a suite. I would recommend using the Lexington Street exit to hail a cab from between 5 PM-6:30 PM as the cab lines on Park Avenue are way too long. I missed a dinner reservation because of it."
218,1969,"Dec 10 2008	Really enjoyed our stay	Stayed 5 nights at the Waldorf Astoria in November.Upgraded to a King suite at check in, which was great. No negatives to our stay.Room was cleaned to a high standard.Breakfast in the towers lounget was of the continental variety, would only pay for this if you really want the convenience.Spent most of the time out of the hotel although made use of Harry's Bar early evenings and for a quick drink before bed, great ambience, good service"
219,1969,"Dec 2 2008 	Relive a golden era	Ya gotta love grand old New York! We arrived by cab on the Park Ave side. The hotel was quite busy so we toted our own luggage up a short flight of stairs into the enormous lobby. It was as if we entered a long lost era. The lobby features those high ceilings and big chandeliers you rarely find in contemporary buildings.Checkin was very quick.. the front desk team very friendly. Took our own bags to the room. Booked through corporate travel, it was your basic room. The decor is a bit dated but very plush. A king bed that slept well. A big flat screen tv. Furniture in good condition. Nice, very clean and well appointed marble bathroom with a shower, no bathtub. Again, I had booked a basic room.. so I give the Waldorf a big thumbs up that I wasn't in some dark dank closet but instead in a well appointed space. We had drinks in the lobby bar. Very pricey (16 each) but well made. Came with good bar snacks. The bar was not clubby as you'd might expect in an old grande dame hotel though. A bit disappointing.Checked out via the service on the television. The bellhop had us wait inside (in the warmth) until our car arrived. Overall a pleasant experience. Better than many of the newer boutigue hotels with tiny rooms and darkened hallways. I would go stay here again if my business or visit keeps me on the east side of NYC."
220,1969,"Nov 27 2008 	Wonderful hotel experience	Myself and my girlfriend stayed here the week of 19th November. we arrived at the hotel at about 245pm, to have our bags helpfully taken from the taxi, in the underground entrance off lexington avenue. We went to the grand lobby and were checked straight in to our deluxe room. The staff during our whole hotewl stay were very good, from the doormen to the reception staff, concierge desk, travel desk and the cleaning people were all very nicve and helpful.Our bags were delivered to our deluxe room promptly. The room itself was fantastic, it definetley was a bit bigger than i was expecting. The bed was a huge and super comfortable kingsize bed, really good. The room was quite big that we had three large windows facing the bed, but the room was in no way cold, in fact we even turned the heating off at night. We also had two large separate built in wardrobes. The bathroom was all marble and the shower was good. The wireless signal in the room was not the strongest, but for all the length of time i was using it for, i just used the free service in the lobby.The hotel location itself is fantastic. The nearest subway entrance is only about 150yards away, fith avenue shopping only a five minute walk away and times square is about 15 minute walk or a quick ride on the subway.Is the hotel brand new and shiny...no. But it has a charm and charisma and everything was spotlessly cleana and in working order while i stayed there. I would definitely stay here again for a New York holiday."
221,1969,"Nov 26 2008	Upgraded!	I wanted to say that I too was on the Cunnard booking and the organisation from Cunnard was not good but also add that I feel we were really well treated by the Hotel staff and how we enjoyed our stay in this majestic old style hotel. The hotel had said the rooms would not be avaialble until 3pm, we knew this prior to arrival so we went sight seeing. On return after 3pm I went straight to reception desk and we booked straight in. I know that other Cunnard guests waited in a reception room for a long time but I feel this is because the information they got from the tour guides was not good. We had asked our travel agent to arrange two rooms together and as this was not available we got upgraded to a junior suite. This was wonderful large room which had recently been decorated with a huge really comfy bed. The other room we saw was also excellent. It appears that your experience of this hotel depends on the standard of the room allocated, if unhappy ask to be moved!We found really helpful staff who went out of their way to help throughout the Hotel.The Cunnard group was over 300 people so the check in was not going to be easy, all I can say is how well we wre looked after. It is a great hotel, close to the action."
222,1969,"Nov 25 2008 	After the QM2 crossing	We were booked here via Cunard after a transatlantic crossing on the QM2. Hotel was a disaster at the start. We arrived early (not sure who to blame) at 11.45 but our tickets said rooms ready for 3pm. Luggage taken off coach and put on pavement outside hotel.We were put in a very hot room and given coffee and advised that as we were a large party - 300 - our rooms may take a time to be allocated.Sensing a long wait my husband and I left the hotel and began our sightseeing trip.We arrived back at the hotel at 4pm to see little change. Loads of our party getting very agitated as few rooms had been allocated and that our luggage was still outside on the pavement! There was nothing to drink despite requests for water. A representative from the hotel said that rooms would be released as soon as possible.5pm came and went with the production of 3 jugs of iced water and paper cups but no rooms being released.Despite being told to wait for our keys/rooms to be allocated I joined a short queue in the main reception of the hotel. I checked in as normal and was given my room key and advised my luggage was in my room!!!Quite obviously the hotel was not able to cope with the Cunard guests and showed it was utterly unprepared.Next morning we received a letter from management apologising for the delays and we were given a credit to our room account of 50 dollars. This did not even cover the cost of a buffet breakfast for two.Our room was draughty, the sash windows were not clean and the whole room had an air of faded charm.The reception/lobby of the hotel is magnificent and is a magnate for all tourists to New York and is not to be missed, but there is no way I would stay here again.Some of the blame for the problem can be laid at the feet of Cunard and this is also being addressed."
223,1969,"Nov 24 2008 	Dreadful welcome at the door but everything else fab	Dreadful welcome. Our taxi pulled up, no help from the taxi driver to get our luggage out. The doorman saw us and barked &quot;It's too early to check in!&quot; and promptly ignored us with no help for luggage / doors etc. It was 2 30 pm ! However everything else was fab. The diamond desk sorted out a double bedded room with a separate dressing area for 4 girls. Jackie and Mary were very welcoming and helpful, giving us info on shoppping and other trips. They assisted with obtaining a late checkout as well. Lovely ladies.The public areas were spotless and full of wonderful Art Deco touches.The wedding flowers in the foyer were fabulous ( though we overheard security say on the Saturday night that the wedding guests were fighting!) and we loved reading the history of the hotel from the displays. The staff were smiley, approachable and all took a pride in their job. The doormen at the luggage collection point were a complete contrast to their front door colleagues. They sorted our luggage, smiled and chatted and found an extra large taxi. Excellent.Our room was spotlessly clean and large enough for 4 adults. Plenty of hot water and the beds and bedding were super comfortable.The hotel was in an excellent spot for sightseeing and we would certainly stay there agin"
224,1969,"Nov 17 2008 	Good Stay but wouldn't come back...	Booked the Waldorf Astoria for weekend of November 17th for a Ladies weekend in NY. Was hoping for these lovely large rooms I'd seen written about so many times on the reviews but alas...it was not to be. The room was one of the smallest I'd ever stayed in..tight for 3 women. The bathroom was just like any other hotel bathroom except also maybe smaller. Nothing about the inside of the room made you think you were in anything other than a large dime a dozen chain hotel. Of course the lobby and public spaces were very nice but is it worth the huge upcharge...no.There is no wireless internet except in the lobby and the wired internet is pricey. There was also a shooting in the hotel stores while we were there. A crazy man tried to rob the Cellini jewelry store and he shot the security guard, a retired NYPD officer... sad and crazy! All interactions with staff were pleasant but again, nothing to brag about.The Sunday brunch was quite a shock. It is set up in the lobby and looks very nice although not much more elegant or posh than a local resteraunt in my town. The cost was $95 per person... Ouch!"
225,1969,"Nov 10 2008 	Charming and Full of Character	Myself and three girlfriends were all sharing one room but hey - we were staying at the Waldorf! The room was large with two generous sized and very comfortable beds. We had a separate dressing room with wall to wall mirrored wardrobes, with double doors leading to a large bathroom complete with huge mirror and marble washstand. After reading several reviews where people were disappointed with their rooms - we were thrilled with ours. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful, the service couldn't be faulted. Rooms were clean and tidy, there's a turn down service so don't leave stuff on your beds when you go out in the evening. Towels were changed twice a day, even when we'd left them out to dry. One down side for us English ladies was that there are no tea-making facilities but we had brought our own travel kettle and tea-bags after being fore-warned by other reviews. Take the time to have a look at the exhibition of old photos and memorabilia in the lobby and visit the Ballroom and Starlight Bar - fabulous art decco decor. Apparently there's a guided tour of the hotel but only on Thursdays so we missed that. We had one rather decadent night drinking champagne in the piano bar where we were spoilt rotten by the most lovely waiter who brought us complimentory savoury nibbles, then dainty cakes, then chocolate desserts in champagne glasses - with the third bottle of champers also being &quot;on the house&quot; we had a lovely memorable evening - hic!"
226,1969,"Nov 9 2008 	Of course it was great but...	First of all, this is THE W-A, so it is an amazing (and amazingly historic) hotel. The room was HUGE, especially for being in the heart of Manhattan. We had an OK-sized bathroom, a nice sized living room, a bedroom w/ King and a walk-in closet. BAM!!!The service was great and any staff we came across were helpful.BUT....there were some things I was not crazy about, like the bathroom door was big and swung open w/in an inch of the toilet - NOT convenient. And the hotel, as historic as it is, is also OLD...the dark hallways w/ old carpet reminded me of &quot;The Shining,&quot; no kidding. But all in all it was a great stay for a weekend. Truly awesome to have stayed in 1 of America's most historic and luxurious hotels."
227,1969,Nov 7 2008 	Beatiful Elegant a fantastic stay.	The Waldorf Astoria hotel was beautiful and elegantStayed in Manhattan for three days whilst visiting friends in New Jersey .Family of four (two girls 14 &amp; 10). The lobby areas are a must see even if your not staying there. The staff where friendly and so helpful. We had a good look round the ballroom was unbelievable.Our room had two double beds although not large it was very comfortable.The location was great short walk to the Rockefeller top of the rock is a must.It was well worth paying the extra to experience staying at the Waldorf.
228,1969,"Nov 6 2008 	Living on it's past	This is the second time we've stayed at the Waldorf, the first time we were upgraded to a fantastic suite, this time we were given the smallest hotel room I've ever seen, for three of us! We asked to move and the room we were given was certainly larger but with peeling wallpaper, ripped cushions on the furniture and a very unusual smell. We had originally booked for four nights but checked out the next day and went to the London Hotel on 54th and 7th which was a breath of fresh air.The Waldorf has great history and a rare presence, but if you need quality accommodation at a this price you can do a lot better. There is no wireless internet in the room and the wired service is expensive."
229,1969,"Nov 4 2008 	Great service old-world charm	My husband and I stayed at the Waldorf during the NYC marathon since we found a great rate ($275/night) by booking nearly a year in advance on the hotel's website.We loved the attentive service, and especially appreciated the free upgrade to a larger King room. The quality of the service and the history put this hotel in the 5-star category. However, we've stayed in hotels with nicer rooms in 4-star hotels.We recommend the Bear &amp; the Bull bar for a nightcap. The bartenders were hilarious &amp; very attentive. Be prepared to spend $30-40 for two drinks (unless you are drinking the $6 pints of beer).We would definitely stay at the Waldorf if we found another great rate, but there's no way we would pay the going rate of $700/night."
230,1969,"Nov 1 2008 	Overpriced and over-hyped	The hotel staff were really good, the location is excellent BUT the hotel itself is faded glory, the rooms we were in (and we were poart of a large ocnference) were in serious need of redecoration and upgrade, if I had paid $100 per night it might just have been acceptable, for $600 it most certainly was not.I would go out of my way not to stay there again"
231,1969,"Oct 26 2008 	Classic charm but . . .	Stayed here on business in mid October 2008. I had stayed here a couple of years ago and found it to be a little dreary for its price range. This time my room seemed to have been recently renovated, bringing it more in line with what I expected from its reputation and price range (low $400s per night before taxes). Several things about the hotel bugged me. First, it is a bit of a maze with some elevators not going to all floors. If you have meetings in the hotel this can be frustrating. Probably not a big deal - part of the charm for some. Second, the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling off and the sink was chipped. Not what I would expect at all at this price range. Third, there was no hot water one morning when I went to take a shower. Definitely not what I would expect. Last, the price of cocktails in the bar was astounding. Two basic cocktails, although excellent, set me back $40, which even for Manhattan seems beyond the pale. Positives were: great location, classic charm in the lobby and public areas, fast bell hop service coming and going, friendly concierge helped with reservations without a pause even a couple of days before we checked in, personal wake up call from a real human being, and nice and quiet rooms, at least on the upper floors."
232,1969,"Oct 25 2008 	Wonderfull old world nyc glamour	I have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria now on 3 occasions....i love the location of this hotel....Park Avenue.Great location for 5th Avenue shopping...although close to all other areas you will deff visit.Hotel rooms are of stardard size for NY....most rooms not very large if you book std rooms.Hotel has a very 'Old World Glamour ' feel with still with all original features from when hotel was first built.I have saw many celebs at this hotel,and watched first hand a hollywood movie being filmed in the lobby!!!"
233,1969,"Oct 23 2008 	Did exactly what it said on the tin	Waldorf Astoria. A classic piece of NYC. Had to be done really, as (for now) it was my only visit to NYNY. I am so glad i stayed here. Yes, its not your trendy boutique hotel in the village, but it is a piece of history, and its like living, in a piece of history. Great service from all, had a refrigerator delivered to the room FOC - great for keeping beers in ! - wonderful service from front of house, great bar - who could resist having a manhattan in manhattan !! - just a great place to spend a long weekend. i would recommend it. room was fine, a litlle dated, but what do you expect. everything clean and working order. had great alarm clock with ipod docking station. stole all of the toiletries and stationery, well, you have to don't you !!go there once, for the experience, you won't be disappointed - we weren't !"
234,1969,"Oct 23 2008 	Time Warp in a positive way	After a couple of stays in this NYC classic Im very pleased with service and also with rooms provided. We had our requests met with good attitude, although some mix-ups and misinformation occured, but nothing serious or nothing to effect our stay.As usually mentioned here this is a wonderful historic place with importance and iconic status to NYC. While we where there Alfred E. Smith Foundation had its annual dinner featuring Barack and John making some decent jokes. We didnt get to the dinner, though...If you dont mind some aging and spots here and there and want to experince tradition with good sense of today, Id say go for it!"
235,1969,"Oct 19 2008	Stunning hotel but can find better for the price.	This is a stunning hotel and a piece of NYC history. At $500 a night though i found the grand hyatt to have nicer, larger rooms and the service to be better. The Grand Hyatt usually falls between $350-450 a night."
236,1969,"Oct 19 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	We stayed at the Waldorf for 4 days last week and, after reading several negative reviews, I have to say that we were pleasantly surprised. I should note that we used our Hilton Honors points to book the room, so it was basically free-- but it was also the lowest category of room that they had available. It was a large (by NYC standards) room with decent furnishings, a nice bathroom, and a great, comfy bed. We've stayed in several other historic/landmark hotels, and I have to say that this one seemed much more cookie-cutter than the others. But, we noticed no musty smells or signs of shabbiness that were reported by some other reviewers. We were notified, after we checked in, that the water system needed maintenance and there would be no water in the guest rooms from midnight until 5 am the next day! This was no problem for us, but I can see how it could have been a major problem for others. Our room had a terrible view of a lower rooftop with utility equipment, but it turned out to be a blessing because we were away from the city traffic noise. The walls are a bit thin, so you tend to hear what's going on in other rooms (honeymooners, please keep this in mind). The hotel staff was pleasant, helpful, and professional. The Waldorf's location is great-- in mid-town, two blocks from Rockefeller Center, with two subway stops nearby on Lexington Ave. There's a lot going on at this hotel... it seemed that every evening there were people milling around the lobby in black-tie attire. You really feel like you're in the center of all the action. Very New York."
237,1969,"Oct 14 2008 	A trip back in time	We celebrated our 10th anniversary at the Waldorf recently booking through the Hilton Honors customer service due to a complex itinerary. First, the lobby, bar area and Bull and Bear restaurant were lovely and did not disappoint. We were upgraded to a suite (two rooms + wet bar room, bath and vanity area) due to my gold status. In this era, when it seems nothing is free, the Waldorf management really came through with a surprise gift of a full size champaign and chocolate dipped strawberries waiting in our room to acknowledge our anniversary. That really meant a lot. Make no mistake, however. The other reviews are on to something. The room just seems to lack pizzazz and/or doesn't seem to convey $500/nt value somehow. Some of that may be that a dollar doesn't go very far in NYC. I stopped to consider what I would ask them to do differently. Unfortunately, the reality may be that staying true to the hotel's history and art deco style may mean living with what feels to some extent like staying in your grandma's living room. If they updated decor to the luxury standards we've come to expect, would it be just another hotel vs. a trip back in time?"
238,1969,"Oct 13 2008 	Waldorf fine but shabby in places	I was looking forward to my one night stay at the Waldorf this past weekend. I have to say there were highpoints and low points. The lobby is wonderful. Angel at reception was patient and kind when checking me in early. But my room - 1060 - was not the best. The bed was great and comfy, but the wallpaper was separating and had a few problems. The white curtains were dirty, and the cable tv seemed to be having problems, too, as most of the stations were a little snowy.The service was, however, impeccable from the room service to the maid who turned down my bed to the Bull &amp; Bear and to the guest service managers who handled my complaints about the wall paper, etc. (I hope the room got looked at after I left). I was given free breakfast at Oscar's and $75 off my room price. Yes, things are pricier at the Waldorf ($95 for Sunday brunch) I treated myself to a Waldorf Salad (appetizer size) and a glass of the house champagne which came to $34.00. Room Service for onion soup and hot chocolate was about the same. I enjoyed people watching - no dowagers in tiaras -but several rather formal events were taking place that night at the hotel. Surprised by the lack of doormen at the front to assist with cabs, etc., but on the whole, a pleasant experience. Would I stay again? If I got a good rate again - and I would make sure that I didn't get room 1060."
239,1969,"Oct 4 2008	Does not live up to the reputation	We spent a week here for our honeymoon. We found the experience somewhat lacking. We went straight to check in after a 10 hour flight. The staff were apprehensive about assisting us until, after they served several people before us, they discovered we were staying in a suite and their entire attitude changed. I found that approach mercernary at best. Our room was extremely large, however the bathroom was very small and not terribly moden. The whole hotel gave us the impression that it must have been something in its time but some modernising is needed here. We were on the 27th floor and we still found street noise a problem, however we soon learnt that this is a new york thing and therefore hardly the fault of the hotel. The lifts were not working properly for 2 days while we were there and as we were so high up, taking the stairs was dreadful, especially after walking around the whole of manhattan during the day. Our new york experience was somewhat disappointing all round. We found it a soulless, money hungry city."
240,1969,"Sep 29 2008 	Where's Waldorf?	I broke down and spent the extra $115 per night to take my wife to the Waldorf-Astoria, instead of a cheaper NYC hotel after reading a bad review about that other hotel on TripAdvisor concering bed bugs. The Main Lobby and floor of the Waldorf is opulent, but the room I was in was significantly less so. The room I stayed in was nothing too special, and lacked features you would expect in a high class hotel. There was no flat screen television, no t.v in the bathroom, the queen sized bed was too small, and the lighting was poor. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice hotel room. But, I expected great and was disappointed. There always seemed to be a bustle in the main lobby comprised of well dressed foreignors and corporate types. The best thing about this hotel is its lobby and location. The hotel is situated in easy walking distance to mid-town sites and is surrounded by impressive buildings. As NYC mid-town hotels are un-godly expensive, the Waldorf was actually a fairly good bargain. My room, unfortunately, was near the elevator shafts, so I keep hearing the swoosh of elevator cables all night while I was trying to sleep. That's my fault for trusting the reception staff to pick my room, because I went with the cheaper option of having my room selected for me upon arrival."
241,1969,"Sep 26 2008 	Great stay	We began our honeymoon in New York, at the Waldorf Astoria and it was really great! There was a bottle of champagne with strawberries waiting for us and the room (a deluxe one with queen bed) was very spacious and clean. The hotel is huge and very charming. The position is very comfortable. The staff was very king and helped us when we had some troubles with our luggage. In a word: marvellous! I hope I'll able to visit it again sooner or later!"
242,1969,"Sep 23 2008 	Great Hotel	We were recently very lucky to spend one night in the Waldorf, thanks to my sister &amp; brother-in-law booking us in with their Hilton points. We had a great king size superior room on corner of hotel - more like a suite as it had separate dressing room. I liked the old decor and charm, the room was very comfortable and by far the most luxurious we've ever stayed in. It was also the largest. There were so many cupboards and wardrobes - our meagre overnight bag looked very lost! The housekeeper was very attentive with regards to making sure we were happy with everything in our room.We used the Starbucks for snack on arrival and the Bull &amp; Bear for cocktails before going out in the evening. We had emailed the hotel a few days in advance re menus as my husband has special dietery requirements but unfortunately they didn't bother to reply - so we didn't eat there.We also found that the hot water supply in the room wasn't that great.Neverthless, we did enjoy our overnight stay there and thought it was very grand hotel."
243,1969,"Sep 20 2008 	Historic and unique but aging	I stayed at the Waldorf and found it charming and authentic, but it does show its age. The Waldorf service is top notch, with lots of extremely helpful staff at the ready at all times. Great food, location, and fitness center as well. Starbucks in the lobby - yay! The accommodations are not necessarily as deluxe as you might expect at this price point (more than $700/night) - the bathroom in my suite was tiny, with only a pedestal sink and a shower/tub combo. I could not open the shampoo bottle to save my life, and outlets were hard to find. On the upside, though, the towels, sheets and robes are fabulous, I loved the alarm clock with the iPod docking station, and the view of the Chrysler building out my window was priceless. On the whole it is a treat to stay there, but don't expect flat screen TVs, jetted tubs or updated fixtures. The place has character!"
244,1969,"Sep 16 2008 	Fantastic	We stayed at the Waldorf back in 2004 when we got married and it was truly wonderful. Very glamorous, admittedly a faded glamour but this only added to the charm. The hotel really enhanced our New York experience and the staff were very kind to us, upgrading us to a room with fantastic views of the Chrysler building and sending strawberries dipped in chocolate and a bottle of Champagne up to our room on our wedding night. It was the most, wonderful special time and we WILL be going back but probably not until a special wedding anniversary because it is expensive!"
245,1969,"Sep 13 2008 	Historic Hotel	We stayed in a small double bed room on the 14th floor and even though we had a bad view from our window, our room was comfortable, clean and elegantly decorated. The only small problem was it seemed as though we would occassionally hear a banging and scraping noise coming from the rooms above.The staff was very helpful and eager to please.I would also suggest eating breakfast around the corner since it is Very expensive eating there."
246,1969,"Sep 10 2008 	A piece of NY history!	This hotel is pure New York history, I have always wanted to stay here and being a huge movie fan I was fascinated by this hotel! The hotel has displays about its heritage which are very interesting and just walking around with all the old money clientele is an experience in itself!The location is great for getting to 5th Avenue and to all the NY tourist attractions via the subway which is very cheap and convenient or via the open top bus tour which I highly recommend as it stops outside, is really good value and lots of fun plus you hop on and off at any attraction you want!Also go to Central Park for a full day, there is a lot to see and do and its bigger than you think!The hotel staff were very friendly and we were given free champagne as we were on our honeymoon! The Bull and Bear do the best steak I have ever eaten and I recommend going to Gordon Ramseys restaurant at The London also. This hotel is expensive and as there is so much to do in NY you dont really spend lots of time around the hotel, Id recommend visiting for the infamous Sunday brunch and the tour and staying somewhere a little cheaper! New York is amazing!"
247,1969,"Sep 8 2008 	Loved it!	The Waldorf was not cheap but it was worth it. The hotel is as grand as I had imagined it to be. We stayed in a basic room (no upgrade) but it was still fantastic. The room was a comfortable size, the black out drapes were great, the marble bathroom was lovely. All in all, it was the perfect luxury hotel experience. I have never enjoyed a hotel stay more, I didn't want to leave the room!"
248,1969,"Sep 7 2008 	Corner Suite	I've stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria four or five times over the past two years. As a Hilton Diamond VIP, this is my preferred Hilton full-service property in NYC. The separate check-in lounge for Diamonds, just to the left of the looooooong registration desk, is a nice touch.The Waldorf is truly an historic gem, rich with period details. I booked a one bedroom suite for $529 and received an upgrade to corner suite 13-A (yes, they have a 13th floor). A nice room with non-working fireplace in the living room, crystal sconces, small but nice marble bath, and a very comfortable bedroom with walk-in closet, suite 13-A overlooks St. Bart's.Room service was prompt and very cordial. The housekeeping staff were pleasant and attentive. Bathroom amenities were on a par with the Four Seasons.Peacock Alley is a great spot for lunch or cocktails. Kenny's gives an upscale men's haircut in a private salon, for a price (about $125). Avoid the Bull &amp; Bear - if you want a steak, go out on the town.If you love historic hotels, you won't be disappointed at the Waldorf."
249,1969,"Sep 3 2008 	Just like the movies	The Waldorf Astoria is everything you'd expect from a 5 star New York City Hotel. Absolute luxury and first class service.Personally speaking, the location is a little too tourist friendly but I can't fault the hotel. The service was fantastic."
250,1969,"Sep 3 2008 	Wowie Waldorf	I used Trip Advisor to review a number of hotels prior to booking for my stay in NYC. As the Waldorf had very mixed reviews, I decided to take a chance anyway and book it - keep the fingers crossed and hope for the best. I need not have worried, our experience was utterly fantastic! Yeah, the doorman was a bit distracted when we stepped out of the taxi but I can carry my own case and yeah there was a wee queue for check in and breakfast but what's the rush - I'm on holiday!!! Nothing about our Waldorf experience dissapointed - the room was luxurious, particularly the mattresses and its a pleasure to be in a hotel with an environmental conscience. We ordered room service one evening and both the service and food were second to none. I work in a quality and customer focused environment and tend to suffer a bit of occupational hazard - with the Waldorf there was no need. I would return here again and again, it certainly contributed to a wonderful NYC experience for me! Thank You!"
251,1969,"Aug 31 2008 	Enjoyed my stay 100 %	Stayed overnight from Sat-Sun in August 2008. Everything want smooth. In the times of Hotel Chains and standardized products the Waldorf Astoria was a good surpise. Still the style of an old Grand Hotel, every member of the staff treated me like I am the most important guest for them, even if my room was one of the cheapest available. I enjoyed the stay. The breakfast could have been a little better but is was according to the standard of this hotel. I did not expect and I must say I did not want a high tech &amp; modern design room. I just wanted to enjoy the stay"
252,1969,"Aug 29 2008 	Out of this World!!!	I stayed at this hotel last year and I chose it because it was my first time in New York and after hearing about the Waldorf and seeing it in so many movies I just had to see it for myself!I was not disappointed!!My friends and I hired a Limo to take us to the hotel as we thought we may as well as it really didnt cost that much (about 30 each for a return trip for 3 of us) the limo pulled into the underground car park of the waldorf and we were greated by a staff member who immediately loaded our luggage on to a trolley and guided us to the reception desk to check in, this was very quick!!He then showed us to our hotel room (2 double bed deluxe room). The room was beautiful!!!! very spacious we had a corner room and had a view of park ave, you really feel in the heart of the city! The room looked so nice i was afraid to touch anything and was very warm and inviting compared to some hotel rooms now that feel quite impersonal and clinical! The bathroom was very clean, great shower (nothing worse that a shower that has no power in it) and overall a great standard!!I also found the staff to be fantastic! I went to the shop within the waldorf to buy a sewing kit as I found I had a hole in my jumper the hotel staff offered to have it fixed FOR FREE!! Overall the staff were so helpful!! Ive never been to a hotel where i've felt so well looked after! from beginning to end this hotel is truely an experience and yes it can be expensive but if you can afford it or can save really hard like I did haha its well worth it! We ordered room service on our last morning which was so much fun just to have done it i think it was $25 each and all silver service i would deffinately do it just to treat yourself!The staff were perfect! The room was perfect! The door man was so friendly i loved staying there just because it was so nice talking to him in the morning, the staff are a credit to this hotel.I really hope I can stay here again, i give this hotel 11 out of 10!I think if anyone has found fault with this hotel they are very very very hard to please!!"
253,1969,"Aug 27 2008 	Fantastic stay at the Waldorf	We have just returned from staying at the Waldorf Astoria and had a wonderful time. We were apprehensive after reading some of the recent reviews but every fear was unfounded. On arrival at the hotel, we had to enter via the car park which was disappointing, but the doormen don't like airport shuttle buses parked outside the front entrance.We found our way to the lobby with our cases and checked in within five minutes. The staff were friendly and asked if we needed help with our luggage but we declined, knowing that it might not arrive quickly.When we entered our room we were very impressed with the size and the decor was traditional and well maintained. We had e-mailed a few days previously to ask for the best room possible at our rate and also stated that it was our anniversary, so arrived to find a bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries with a note wishing us a pleasant stay.The airconditioning was effective, the room was clean, and the maids provided a turndown service each night. We were on the 27th floor and had good views towards the East River and Park Avenue.We did not intend to eat at the hotel knowing that the prices were high, so have no complaints about the cost. We did drink in Harry's bar and ,although quite expensive, I am sure that we could have found other hotels nearby with the same prices.The hotel itself was beautiful, and if you take the time to walk around and explore, you can imagine what it must have been like in its heyday. The grand ballroom and silver corridor were especially magnificent.The location of the hotel is great as you are within easy walking distance of most of the main attractions but do not have to put up with the constant hustle and bustle of somewhere like Times SquareWe had no problems buying food nearby and ate in places varying from the cheap Viennese deli on Lexington towards the Chrysler building, to the Oyster bar in Grand Central Station, and the View restaurant 48 floor up in the Marriott Marquis hotel in Times Square.We also would recommend taking the Gray Line bus tours from the 49th street side of the hotel. We had 72 hour passes and these included all routes and tickets to the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty. There are street vendors everywhere but we bought ours at the hotel ticket desk. We experienced prompt attention and good service with no queues.We went to the Statue of Liberty via the bus and although it took some time to get there, the tour was very interesting. The queue to the boat was long but moved very quickly and we only waited half an hour. We did not get off the boat but you can disembark at Liberty Island and Ellis Island if you wish.We went to the Empire State building when it opened at 0830hrs as recommended by the hotel staff, and walked straight through with no waiting and no crowding on the viewing platform. Later in the day queues form outside and around the building.Returning to the hotel after a busy day was always a pleasure and the sheer opulence of walking through the lobby and not being in a brand new 'chain' hotel with no history was lovely.Staying at the Waldorf Astoria does not have to be that expensive and to be in such beautiful surroundings only enhanced our stay in New York.The staff were always friendly, helpful and easy to approach.We hope to return to New York and stay in the Waldorf Astoria again."
254,1969,"Aug 22 2008	A Grand Dame	In today's world of Holiday Inn's, Courtyards, etc. it's always a pleasure and a treat to take a step back in time and bask in the glory of a time gone by.After reading some of the posts, it made me wonder if I was the only one to appreciate this landmark hotel. I took in all the glitz and glamor the hotel could offer. Our hallway was adorned with photos of those celebrities caught in the moment of being in the Ballroom, at dinner, and the likes. I wish I had more time to stroll the other hallways and gaze upon moments preserved forever. My daughter and I were in the city for one night, to attend a cooking demonstration at the Astor Center on E4th St. We were able to take the subway, just around the corner from the hotel, and be in the SOHO District in 10 minutes, and I think it only cost $4 for the round trip. We took the train into the city, so we didn't have to deal with driving/parking, because it is a nightmare!We were upgraded to a suite, offered a choice of continental breakfast or 2 cocktails at any of the 4 bars at the hotel and 2 bottles of water --being an Hilton Honors member does have it's priveldges :)Our 2 room suite was huge...a small entryway, large 'coat' closet, fireplace in the living room area, another huge (7x5ft) walk in closet in the sleeping area. I felt extremely spoiled having the room we had..we were on the 9th floor of a 26 floor hotel. They do have a club level. Water pressure and temperature were just fine. 2 tv's, mini-bar (always outrageous prices with mini-bars, but they are fun to see what's in them!) We were at the end of the hallway so I never heard any noise...but being in the city is loud..constant traffic, horns, sirens, but that is all part of what makes NYC the best city in the world! NYC is expensive, so be prepared...We had drinks at the Peacock bar and just watched the world go by. Our drinks were complimented by 2 little dishes of marinated olives and espresso dusted almonds...thank you Nick and Michael for your attentiveness, you're great mixologists! Even at 10pm there were people, lots of people checking in, checking out, the front desk was always busy when we walked by, and we were there on a Monday. I loved hearing the clock chime. There is so much history in the hotel--enjoy it while you can, and if you can, be grateful that you were able to...."
255,1969,"Aug 19 2008 	Don't Waste Your Money	I have been to NYC on many occasions. I have stayed at some WONDERFUL places like the Carlyle, Ritz Carlton and Affinia Dumont. On this trip, we didn't want to spend that much money on accomodations as it was only for one night. However, I was traveling with someone who really wanted to stay at the Waldorf. We found some very reasonable rates online (around $350). We drive into the parking area for Valet. When you first drive in, it seems very nice. We waited about 15 minutes just to pull the car up and get the bags out. No one helped us with our bags. This is not a big deal, as we are certainly capable of carrying our own bags, but I certainly expected better service from The Waldorf.We finally get inside and found it a bit hard to find where to find the lobby. Not a big concern.We get to the lobby, which is indeed very nice, but certainly an older hotel. We then found a large row of registration desks. We found an even longer line to check in. Standing on line with our bags for about 10 minutes or so. Again, not what I would come to expect of a hotel. I have received better service at the Marriott.There are a large array of people staying at the hotel. We get to our room and it is a good size for a superior room. The hotel, it's obvious is older and the renovations don't appear to have helped. Upon going to the restroom, I walk out and notice that I am actually walking downhill from the bathroom to the main room. There is a slope in the floor in our room.The bathroom and the bedroom were spacious. The bathroom had been renovated, but it seemed more like a 'face-lift'. The sheets on the bed were ok and the towels in the bathroom were good as well.Getting a cab from the Park Street entrance was a nightmare. The front door men seemed really lazy and there was always a line of people waiting for a cab. Not to mention the bike riders constantly asking if you want a ride. It's NY, so it's ok. The staff would try and move them to the side, but they always seemed to be in the way of cabs and cars. It was easier to walk a block down and flag a cab myself.The restaurant took a very long time to get seated for breakfast, which was odd considering there were only 4 people eating at the time. The food was ok, the bloody mary was terrible and overall WAY too expensive. Would have been MUCH better to hit a deli.Location is ok, but there are many other great and reasonably priced hotels in the area that would be worth your time. Don't waste your time staying here."
256,1969,"Aug 18 2008	Old elegance in need if some renewing	When you enter the Waldorf-Astoria, you are greeted by the lobby's obvious opulence and beauty (though if you arrived by car, you will first notice the complete disorganization of the parking in the driveway which runs through the middle of the building - there is luggage everywhere.. it looked like when American Airlines' baggage system broke down).As you roam the halls and arrive at your room, you'll notice that things aren't exactly as elegant as they once were. This seems to be a pattern at the older, more historic hotels. They rely a bit too much on their historical value, but don't seem to be reinvesting any of their hefty price tag on updating or upkeep. There are lots of walls that have been patched over (and not patched well), our room had holes in the wall where a headboard had previously been drilled or a painting previously sat, peeling wallpaper, a curtain hook that was coming off the wall, and other signs of age. Everything was otherwise clean. The bathroom was probably the part of the room in the best condition, though the shower head was starting to rust, and the shower faucet had references to a button that needed to be depressed but there was now only a hole. I was also surprised that our room had an old CRT television.. I'd expect flat screens at a hotel of this caliber at this point in time.I would also say that while this isn't really important to me, I was surprised at the level of service. I don't think I saw a single door man, and staff seems to be mostly in the lobby area only. Overall, no major problems or complaints - the hotel just doesn't live up to its name, reputation or price tag."
257,1969,"Aug 13 2008	Really disappointing	This is a grand old hotel, and the lobby and public spaces don't disappoint. Our room, however, did. Cramped, dark, with no place to sit comfortably and relax (except on the bed or at the desk), with a view of some sort of shaft. In order to tell if the sky was blue or gray, we had to crane our necks up from the corner of the window. The concierge staff was helpful if you could get to them; there were always a lot of people waiting in line at their desks and at the front desk. The cleaning staff was friendly and did a good job.If the hotel cost less, one would take these inconveniences in stride, but when paying so much, one expects more. For less money, I think I would in future book a nicer room at, for instance, the Helmsley on Central Park South. Better location and you wouldn't feel depressed every time you returned from touring.P.S. When, in answer to a question about my stay, I indicated my disappointment while checking out a friendly person at the desk gave me her name and said she would see I got a nice room next time I came. I probably won't take her up on it."
258,1969,"Aug 12 2008 	Not Great. For that price there are so many other hotels to choose from.	We just returned from a trip to New York City. We have been there many times and have stayed in many different hotels that varied in price. The Waldorf is pricey and you would expect things to be different that what we experience. I found the room had an old musty smell. The lobby was grand and beautiful but there was always a line at the front desk. Even though there were probably 10 spots for staff to help customers there were never more that 3 or 4 people working at one time. The line was ridiculous. On our last night we woke in the morning with no running water. Supposedly there was a problem in the middle of the night and they had to shut off the water throughout the hotel. When they turned it back on at about 7:30 a.m., it came out of the facets in the sink, the shower and in the toilet, black. We could not shower, wash or even brush out teeth. When I got down to the desk to complain, I had to wait in line to speak with someone. I heard other people compaining about the water as well. I was compensated with a free night. That was the only prositive part of my stay. They also sent our bill up to our room on the day of checkout, riddled with mistakes. There were charges for mini bar purchases we did not make and charges to the fitness centre when my husband is a gold priority club member and fitness centre visits are free. For the amount of money we paid for this hotel room, there are so many other hotels I would prefer to stay at."
259,1969,"Aug 11 2008 	ok hotel	For the hotel itself, the staff was great. We had a problem with our theatre tickets, and although they couldn't help, the concierge tried. They were always willing to hail us a cab. They held our bags for us both before we checked in and after we checked out. They were great.The room was really largel and had a fantastic view of NY The bathroom was a good size, although the shower was a stall and no bath. I don't take baths in hotel rooms, so no problem. The hotel offers a free continental breakfast, which I didn't take advantage of, and free coffee and tea , which is really nice for a NY hotel. And the rates were comperable or better than other places in the city."
260,1969,"Aug 10 2008 	Nice hotel with excellent service	We stayed 6 nights at the Waldorf Astoria, and it lived up to our expectations. We knew that it was a very old hotel, but wanted to stay there for the history and to be able to say that we had been there. We arrived early in the evening, but the room they had reserved for us was not ready yet, so instead of transfering us to a less nicer room they gave us a free dinner at the Bull and Bear Restaurant, which is a very good steak restaurant at the hotel. When we were done eating the room was ready.We stayed in a superior room with a big flatscreen TV and nice furniture. The aircondition was old but it work just fine. The place is a little worn down, but we knew that, so there was no surprises. Our view from the room was not so great, as we were overlooking the construction between 2 buildings and part of Park Avenue. Overall it we had a great stay here and the service of the staff was excellent. Im not sure that we will go back, because at that price you can find much better hotels in New York, but its fun to be able to say that we have been there and to have experienced the unique history of the hotel."
261,1969,Aug 8 2008 	Loved the Waldorf Astoria New York City	We have just returned from stay at the Waldorf Astoria. The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service before. This is absolutely the best hotel we have ever stayed in on any vacation. The entire staff went out of their way to help us with any need. We asked a staff member in the lobby directions to the 49th street exit to catch a tour and he did not just give us directions he walked us the entire way to the door. Every one was helpful and friendly. The door man remembered my 7 year old son and called him by name every time that we entered the hotel. We will return to this hotel on our next visit to New York.
262,1969,"Aug 8 2008 	Do not stay during a heat wave	Overall the hotel is clean. Our room seems to have been updated based on other review. The bath room and room are a bit on the small side but this is NYC. They are big for NYC. I have stayed at other hotels in the city with smaller rooms. The room was cleaned every day and even had a turn down service.My issue with the Waldorf was that nothing seemed to run smoothly. Maybe my expectations were too high. We checked in at 11 am and were told our room was not available. This was no big deal and expected. We were asked to give them a cell phone number and they would call. We were also told not to stand in line when we returned since all we needed to do is big up keys. I should also mention that we were using Hilton Points to stay at the hotel and were in the city for a wedding. We left the hotel and went to entertain ourselves in the city. At 4:30, we decided we should head back since we had to be at the wedding rehearsal at 7pm. It was over 100 degrees in the city that weekend and needed to shower before the event. When we arrived at the hotel we went were we told to go at 11 am. A woman working for the hotel came over and said we needed to stand in the check in line. After explaining our situation she said we still need to stand in the line; which had over 10 people in it. Oh, I have forgotten to mention I am Hilton Gold. After a 20 minute wait, we got to someone to help us. We were told that we had been upgraded to a nicer room but it still wasnt available at 5:30pm. At which point, I told her I had to be somewhere at 7pm and needed to shower ASAP. She left to go speak to a peer. 15 minutes later we were given a room key. We were told it was just a normal room and to make it up to us they would give us drinks at one of the hotel bars. At this point, I was more worried about making the rehearsal. We were told our bags would be sent up.After 30 more minutes our bags finally arrived. The room was extremely hot. The bell boy told us they dont keep the AC on in the rooms. He showed us how to work it and left. We were in the room for only 45 minutes before we left as well. The room was as hot as when we got into it.When we got home at 2am the room had not cooled down at all. However, since it was so late and we were exhausted we decided not to worry about it.The next day we went to the front desk and they said they didnt have any other rooms at that time but could move us later in the day around 6pm. The wedding was at 5pm and that was not going to work. They said they would send maintenance up to the room and see what was wrong. That night it didnt feel any cooler. The next day we noticed the entire hotel was warm. In the long run I do not think there was anything wrong with the AC. I believe the Waldorf is an old hotel with an old AC system that can not handle a 100 degree heat wave.On our last day we checked out and stored our bags at the hotel. When we came back to get them at 4pm, it took over 45 minutes to get them. The bell boy even expected us to tip him. FOR WHAT! Thankfully, our car service understood and we still made our flight with plenty of time.Some other issues were that neither our tub nor sink drained properly. Additionally, the mini bar smelled like something had died in it. The smell was terrible. Thankfully, we only opened it once to get our Hilton Gold Gift-bottle water. I did mention this to the maid in the halls. She said she would clean it. I do not know if it was done since I didnt want to risk opening it again. PEWWW!!!We also had a few drinks with friends at Sir Harrys in the Waldorf. The service was terrible. We hit it at a lull so I would expect some slowness but we both had to ask for our bill and then also walk it up to someone to get it run after waiting 20 minutes for her to pick it back up.Unfortunately, my experience didnt get any better once I got home. My bill was $0 since I was using Hilton points for my stay. The Hilton website confirms. However, once I got my credit card statement I had 3 charges on my statement from the Waldorf. One for $16.10; one for $8.70 and one for $1578.00. I have been on the phone with the Waldorf and they plan to credit my card back for all the charges. It is just a hassle to deal with in the first place.I am glad that I got to experience the Waldorf. If I was paying for the hotel, I would go somewhere else. There are plenty of hotels in NYC that do a better job and have better service. The name isnt worth what they are charging and for what you get. Once you get out of the lobby the rooms are the same as any other Hilton, DoubleTree, or Marriott. There is nothing special in the rooms themselves."
263,1969,"Aug 7 2008	Never again	We arrived at 6PM with a reservation for an executive king.When we attempted to check in, we were offered a room with a defective TV but they offered us free movie. We declined. This was a sign of things to come.After 20 minutes they assigned us another room. I clarified to make sure that it was an executive king. When we arrived we found it was an ordinary room. We called down and asked if the room we reserved was not available, why had we been downgraded instead of upgraded.We told them we were furious for being lied to at the reception, downgraded without a discount and unsatisfied, We were tired of arguing and accepted their offer after a half hour of haggling of $100 per night and a bottle of champagne.Our luggage took 45 minutes to arrive. Worse, the bubbly that was supposed to calm us down took almost 2 hours despite the promise of priority service for our unhappiness.In summation, the staff at the front desk are either incompetent or poorly trained or trained to lie. They are overworked and guests are inconvenienced.Hilton ruined the once great Fontainebleau in Miami and were thrown out. They have totally destroyed the Waldorf.I wouldn't go back if they paid me."
264,1969,"Aug 6 2008 	Nice hotel	This hotel is not modern, its a classic piece of New York's history. The lobby is beautiful, the staff are great and the rooms are nice. All the staff that we encountered in our 5 day trip were pleasant, seemed to enjoy their jobs and were very nice and patient. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Our room was very clean, very comfortable. The walls are a little thin so you can hear the odd tv or person but it is to be expected in such an old hotel. The cleaning staff were great, offering privacy when needed and the turn down service was very nice.We stayed there just to experience it and it was worth it."
265,1969,"Aug 5 2008 	Classy hotel infrastructure old rooms	I spent a night at the hotel with my girldriend.When you see the historical building and even more when you enter in the hotel you are absolutely stunned!Fantastic lampadar and lobby with a historical watch in the middle of the lobby.When you pass the elevators you start getting aware of the age of the hotel. The elevators are old and slow, the corridors or nothing special and the rooms have nice beds and desk but not all rooms are newly refurnished. The air conditioning is still very old and smelly.The view from the 7th floor was nice with a view of the Rockefeller center. Nothing special compared to other hotels like Hilton Times Square.Worth a visit but happy to have spent there only one night just for the historical importance of the building."
266,1969,"Aug 4 2008	Enjoyed the Waldorf...Just Know What You Are Getting	Spent a week at the Waldorf Astoria and had a great time. Reviews are split on opposite ends, so I will try to enlighten anyone considering this hotel.First of all, you pay a hefty premium at the WA because it is historic, has a famous lobby, etc. The rooms are large and the hotel displays old world class. Also, a friendly maid was always in the hall if you needed anything. The hotel is kept very clean despite its age. Hotel service was always friendly, but, due to the size of this hotel and its many occupants, you often had to wait a while to get a cab, talk to the concierge, etc.As for the drawbacks, there was some cracking paint above the shower in the bathroom, but nothing major. Don't expect a flat-screen t.v, swimming pool, vending machines, free internet or gym facilities at the WA. I did feel the hotel &quot;nickle and dimed&quot; its guests somewhat considering the premium paid for the hotel (i.e. - $10/day for internet and $15/day to work out in their gym). As for location, there is a subway stop across the street and you can easily get to 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue shopping in a few minutes. However, it is pretty good hike (15 minutes at least) to Times Square/Broadway by foot or about a $10 cab ride. If you are going to visit those areas daily, consider a closer hotel. It does have a Starbucks in the lobby, but there is also one every 50 yards in Midtown (including across the street at 50th and Lexington), so no big deal.Bottom line, I am glad I stayed here just to say I did, but would stay closer to either Times Square or Central Park next time because I spent most of my time there and didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants (Midtown has great restaurants every 30 feet, try them). Since you know you are paying a premium for this hotel, just know that the premium is in return for a stay in a historic hotel that people recognize for its class. If you want more modern amenities closer to the 'around the clock' action in Manhattan, you can spend much less elsewhere."
267,1969,"Aug 2 2008 	Does not deliver	We wanted to stay here to soak up the ambience and history. We have stayed in historical properties before so we knew the rooms would be small and possible a bit dated. What we did not expect was a smelly, poorly furnished, boiling hot room with dirt everywhere. We were totally shocked. The room had a beat up old air conditioner that did not not work the two of the three days we were there. It was filthy. The bathroom was horrid with some sort of drywall bits and other dirt in every nook and cranny. The bathroom ventalation system looked to be about 30 years old (and never cleaned). It made a tremendous noise but seemed to move no air.We called the front desk about the problems. They repeatedly apologized and then did nothing. We asked for a new room to no avail. This was the rare occassion when we dreaded our return from a day of shopping and sight seeing.Just to top it off, we had a view of the top of the roof between two wings which was a bloody mess! I took a picture (which is on another computer so I may get around to uploading it along with the shot the air conditioner I also took) it was so funny/sad. It looked like what you see driving down a back alley in a poorer neighborhood.The public areas are great. They were everything we expected. The food was, sadly, very poor. The drinks were great. The staff were very good too.Having just come from the Michelangelo (at $100 a night cheaper and a much, much better room), this was a real let down. Never again...all the nice places in the hotel are public and you can enjoy it without being subjected to the rooms!"
268,1969,"Jul 31 2008 	Waldorf Times	Recently spend 3 nights at the Waldorf and we would compliment the hotel on a very good central location. Public areas were traditional and well maintained. Our guest room although quite big, was a little tired in style and presentation which was disappointing given the hotel's historical standing in the city. Same for corrdidors to guest rooms.........Was disappointed with lack of flexibility in room charging. We stayed for three nights including a weekend and were charged dearer weekday rates throughout our stay because we stayed from a Friday . If we had only stayed on a Saturday and Sunday, our nightly rates would have been a good bit less.????Hotel expensive to dine it.Lots of good eateries nearby at a fraction of the cost.......also, down town open top tourist bus stops right outside the hotel.......worthwhile to get your bearings."
269,1969,"Jul 31 2008 	Disappointing	I was realy looking forward to visiting the Waldorf Astoria, but was very disappointed. The rooms we were given were poky and in need of a change of decor, the bathroom was tiny and there was a very odd smell in the room. Our outlook was on to another wing of the hotel, so we often looked out to see other people staring at us from their rooms.Windows could not be opened, so the stale smell stayed the whole week.One night I threw the heavy top cover off as I was so hot and found what looked like blood on the inside, I told the chambermaid the next day, and even though there was a clean one put on the bed that night, there was no word of apology.As I went with my son, we requested rooms close together, he ended up down the corridor and round the corner, his room also had a funny smell and was just as poky as mine.I had expected more from this hotel, having read so much about it.I would definately NOT return as there are many more modern, and cleaner hotels to choose from in New York.The only good thing I can say about it was it was nicely situated, breakfast was chaotic, and staff very poor.Love New York, hate the Waldorf."
270,1969,"Jul 29 2008 	Loved Waldorf Astoria	Stayed here nov 07 was a bit unsure after reading the reviews on this site but have to say it was a wounderful stay.Had mini suit was newly refurbished view was out the back of the hotel but wasn't in the room often only to sleep so wasn't that bothered.It was thanksgiving weekend so was very very bussy, would stay there again."
271,1969,"Jul 29 2008 	Better than what we expected but not 100% amazed.	Took a long weekend to stay here with husband, who is a Diamond HH member (we paid for the hotel, so this wasn't a reward stay).Upon arrival, I was expecting a grander entrance to the hotel, instead it was a small revolving door, and a couple of heavy push doors that would not fit a wide suitcase through, and a 50m walk to the lobby. This is not necessarily a criticism, just that I was expecting the lobby/reception area to be visible upon entrance. In saying that, everything was very grand, and there was a beautful bouquet of flowers, probably the largest I have ever seen, on display in the lobby area.The room was very large for NYC, some may call the rooms dated, but I would say that the Waldorf is trying to keep the decor looking grand and classical as opposed to the minimalist style. I thought it was quite nice. There are modern touches like flatscreen TVs, and the radio which accepts ipods.The bathroom was clean and tidy, everything was marble effect. Toiletries felt like good quality.The main cons:Breakfast $25Gym $15/day - unless you use the Guilane spa. I was extremely dissapointed that not even Diamond HH members could use the gym facilities!!Pros:cleanswanky - people will awe when you say you're staying at the Waldorf!great location - steps away from Madonson/5th ave, but also great neighbourhood/local eateries and bars if you take a stroll down 3rd.extremely comfortable bed &amp; pillows.If you're looking for a weekend packed full of activities, and hardly anytime in the bedroom, then the waldorf is probably not worth it, but otherwise its worth a visit on the weekend when rates are lower."
272,1969,"Jul 25 2008 	Waldorf doesn't live up to reputation	My wife and I stayed four nights for business as a part of a large group. Excellent midtown location with the subway immediately across the street to the left on the Lexington entrance. Very good Redstone Pizza, Duane Read Pharmacy, and a liquor store are three blocks to the right down Lexington. Morrell Wine Bar is a great place to people watch the Rockefeller crowds a few blocks away.The Waldorf lobby, common meeting areas, and restaurants still convey a grand old school appeal. The peeling paint in the bedroom bathroom and the non flat screen TV's should be improved. Service was hit or miss when the staff could or could not manage the crowds. The front desk manager was excellent at handling a stressful checkin, while an undertasked bartender at the Bull and Bear was lazy and unattentive. This is a BIG hotel, and there are so many good hotels in the area. I wouldn't stay here unless the price was right or my company was paying again."
273,1969,"Jul 24 2008 	Nice hotel but GREAT location	Stayed in the Waldorf in July 2008 for one week with my mum and sister as a shopping trip and chance to meet with family who live in NYC.On arrival our luggage was taken care of quickly and we were taken to reception rahter than just being directed. Check in didnt go according to plan as when we booked we booked two interconnecting rooms (these were promised by travel agent) On check in there were no interconnecting rooms left although it worked out in the end as the single room was offered on the 17th floor (smoking rooms only) which one of our party wanted.Rooms were big - our room had two double beds, walk in wardrobe (great for the shopping bags) although it did have a small bathroom. We experienced problems with the shower.. you have to run it for over 15 mins before any hot water. My sister complained once and was given breakfast vouchers (which we didnt use) but the water was never fixed properly. Housekeeping okay - turndown service didnt happen every night and when you wanted towels changed they hung up your used ones again so we called down a few times for fresh towels. The room has a/c which you cant turn down lower than 63. Rooms look like they could do with a facelift but hey how long are you spending in your room.We used the Theatre and Tours desk within the hotel to book a show (Chorus Line) Richard on the desk was very helpful and got us great seats. The Concerige desk was again very helpful especially when it came to plotting all the shops we wanted to go on a map! No problems getting a taxi outside the hotel.. although for those who have not been to NYC before like me.. their taxi drivers always ask for a full address of where you are going!!!Theres a Starbucks in the ground floor of hotel which is pricey compared to the starbucks out and about but ideal very first thing in the morning.Hotel has all different types of guests... we saw wedding parties, business persons and tourists.. the hotel does say it has a dress code for lobby areas but we wore shorts etc and noone said anything.The best thing with this hotel is the location. A pleasant 15min walk to Times Square/Tiffanys/Bloomingdales/Grand Central Station its perfect.We wanted to have a late checkout as our flight wasnt till late at night.. when we called down to first ask we were told 75 dollars per hour so we werent going to bother. On the day we were going home we called again and were told first hour free then 35 dollars per hour so another warning... always check again! We also had mini bar charges on final account which we had not used so again check your bill before you leave.All in all a lovely hotel with its amazing lobby and history but personally I prefer a more modern hotel and if I was returning I would find one but ensure it be close to the waldorf as location was great."
274,1969,"Jul 20 2008 	Over-rated	Gorgeous lobby then it goes downhill. For the price paid, there are much nicer hotels in the vicinity - the rooms are very old fashioned - and I dont mean quaint! We had trouble getting hot water via the shower - tip - let the tap run for at least 15 minutes then turn to shower mode. There is a on-site Starbucks but the prices are quite hefty - tip - loads of Starbucks outside and charges are much cheaper. The staff are very helpful but on checking out, noticed we had all been charged for using the mini bar (we couldnt even open ours!) - not a problem though, the charges were immediately taken off. Remember to check your bill before leaving. There is a dress code in certain parts of the hotel but we had no problems wearing shorts and tshirts as were many others, bearing in mind this hotel is also hugely used weddings, business conferences,etc. All in all a fantastic stay in New York but would definetely stay in a more contemporary hotel."
275,1969,"Jul 19 2008	rob and vivs 40th birthday in the waldorf	stayed in the waldorf astoria in march with my girlfriend for our 40th birthday what a hotel. the staff were so helpful what you would expect from a top class hotel .the room was really nice and the bed was so comftable with those triple folded down sheets never slept in a bed like it.if you go out the lexington entrance the are plenty of places for breckfast .a good tip if you suffer from astma you can e mail them and they will supply astma sheets . unless your going to drink out of the mini bar leave the stuff inside alone because as soon as you lift something out it registers on your bill . you can book in online from the buisness suite in the lobby for free for your return flight home the staff are more than helpful.if you want to see a broadway show go to the booking office of the theatre the day before or on the day you can get seats at half price we did at the winter garden went to watch mama mia the seats where 3 rows from the front and the show was fantastic.. if you go to macys shopping as for a discount card in the shop visitors get a 11% discount .have a go at the helicopter flight you will enjoy it we did and a good tip if your going to visit ground zero or liberty island its all in the same area so worth planning we did the helicopter flight then went to ground zero, . all of the starbucks have wi fi so just buy a drink and surf away on your laptop.just a last thing we felt safe all the time in new york night and day even on the subway and we are going back"
276,1969,"Jul 19 2008 	Fantastic!	This hotel has the most beautiful lobby of any otel Ive ever stayed in and although my room, paid for with Hilton Reward points collected over 7 years of almost constant business travelling, was tiny and overlooked the service area of the hotel, who cares? Its a great place to base a stay in NYC if you can afford it (which I normally cant!). The beds were incredibly comfortable and the staff, except for one depressingly surly breakfast waiter were great."
277,1969,"Jul 19 2008	This place is a dump	This place is totally resting on its laurels. Our room was large, which was about the only good point. The carpet was filthy. There were no slippers so I had to request them. They probably haven't done a thorough renovation of the room since 1970. There were layers and layers of paint on the bathroom door, closet doors, and on moulding, whch also had a nice big piece of blue painters tape stuck to it. The furnishings were tired - there was a hole in one of the lampshades. The bed itself was nice as were the sheets, but the decorative pillows and stuff were practically threadbare. The marble/granite was nice in the bathroom, but you could tell the tub had been refinished about a 50 times. There were a few layers peelng off around the drain. Can't complain about the price since we used Hilton points to stay here but if I were paying anything close to the rack rate, I'd be very annoyed. No way would I stay here again - there are so many nice hotels in NY why waste it on a has been?"
278,1969,"Jul 18 2008 	Loved it!	Having read the reviews, I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about staying here with my family, particularly given the comments on the condition of some of the rooms from many previous visitors. However, from the second we arrived until the very second we left the Waldorf, the service was excellent. It was my son's 15th birthday whilst we were in NY and I wanted to make it a special occasion. I had e-mailed the Waldorf a few days in advance explaining this and requested a nice room with a view. We were not disappointed. We had a large room (there were 4 of us) with a separate dressing room and bathroom facilities all in very good condition with an excellent view over Park Ave. The Waldorf even sent my son a personal card, some fine bottled water and exclusive chocolates for his birthday. The hotel is something special and people who plan to stay here must remember it is not a modern hotel, This is quite simply its appeal. The reception areas are stunning and the scent from the wonderful flower arrangements is simply lovely. The staff were always extremely helpful and curteous and made you feel very welcome. This is a truly special hotel which offers character and a bit of history which undoubtedly is its charm. I would have no hesit ation in recommending this hotel to anyone."
279,1969,"Jul 12 2008	Loved the Waldorf	After reading all the negative reviews about the waldorf I was hesitant to stay. We used points for our first trip there in October 2007 and were delighted with our room, service, tour desk... everything. We returned in May and our room was outrageously large for NY - with huge closet, large bathroom with seperate shower and bath, and a seperate sitting area. I love the classic elegance of the hotel and I must say we loved the Waldorf."
280,1969,Jul 11 2008 	There are better options.....	Converted Hilton points for my stay so did not pay. Room was very small. By the time we removed decorative pillows and bedspread walking aroudn the room was severely limited. Bathroom very nice. Air conditioner was marginal at best. If it had been warmer outside the A/C would not have been sufficient. Public spaces are gorgeous. For a nearly 80 yr old building it was very well conditioned. Service was fine. I have stayed at the Hilton NY (Ave of Americas) and for the same # of points could have stayed there and had a better room and a better location. It's a great tourist spot but there are better rooms and locations for the money in NYC.
281,1969,"Jul 10 2008 	Pleased with the Waldorf-Astoria	Be booked at the Waldorf-Astoria since this is such a well known and famous hotel, but we were not very certain after reading some of these mixed reviews. We decided to book an &quot;executive room&quot; (or whatever they call it) to make sure not to end up in one of the smaller rooms. When arriving we were sent to the &quot;VIP&quot; check in because all receptionists were busy. We were seated in this kind of office got a very helpful and nice check in from the lady behind the desk. The room was not ready (as we arrived a bit early), but they would call us when the room was ready. The bell boy took our luggage and we went out to get something to eat. The only bad thing is that the stairs leading from the Park Avenue entrance is quite difficult when you have a lot of luggage. The public rooms are all simply gorgeous and grand like other reviewers tell. No need to repeat the story. After one hour they called and the room was ready. Our room were on the 15th floor with an amazing view of Park Avenue and the church next door. The room were very spacious! Not only for a New York hotel room but in general. The hallways and all public areas are all spacious at this hotel. They were probably not so space efficient in the old days. Large and clean marble bathroom. No peeling paint or dirty ventilation shafts. Very comfortable bed. Clean. Walk-in-closet with iron and iron board. Nice furnishing allthough they could have put in an extra lounge chair or something. The room was not new and not in perfect shape, but it was &quot;nicely worn&quot; and quite acceptable. I think some floors are renovated later than our floor but we were pleased with our room. Very old kind of style, but this is not a trendy boutique hotel. Not over the top luxurious but comfortabel and good size. I think that people have to have in mind that this is a very old hotel and not modern and completely up to date as new hotels would be. However this is much of the charm. If they gutted the entire hotel to make it all trendy and fancy it would not be the same. It would probably end up as a &quot;Las Vegas old style hotel.&quot;The bar next to the lobby and the elevators is a very nice place for drinks. Wonderful and helpful staff. The people working in the bar is of &quot;the old school&quot; and have maybe been working there for their entire lives. The bar in the Park Avenue lobby with live piano music is nice for late cocktails before going out to dine. We ordered room service one day we were to tired to go out, and it didn't take long for the food to arrive. Very efficient. Good service and good food. The last morning of our stay we came home at 6am after some really hard clubbing. We were drunk and probably a bit shabby. They let us keep the room for 3 extra hours without any charge. Very nice of them or we would be completely destroyed the last day in NY.The check out was quick. We had to stay some hours in New York because our plane left quite late. The bell boy came to our room to pick up our luggage and placed it in storage. When we were leaving for JFK we went to the taxi &quot;drive though&quot; inside the hotel, gave them our reciept and the bell boy put the luggage in the taxi. Very efficient and smooth service. The Waldorf-Astoria was everything we expected. Maybe we were put back by reading some reviews and didn't have too much expectations, but compared to other 4/5 star hotels in New York the Waldorf-Astoria is one of the better places we have stayed. Maybe it's advisable to spend the few extra dollars to upgrade from the standard rooms. This will probably make sure you don't end up in a &quot;staff room&quot; or in the smaller rooms. The con is that this hotel is really huge, and even though the service is good and smooth it's only on the surface. There is no personal service at this huge place, but the service we got was good, efficient and met our expectations. We didn't encounter any service problems. The second con is that the lobby doesn't have much sitting space except from in the resturants. There are two huge lobbyes, but very few places to just sit down and wait. The public areas seem to attract tourists not staying there, and this makes the public areas sometimes a bit crowded. Maybe that's the reason why there are so few sitting areas. Would we stay at the Waldorf-Astoria again? Yes. Next time in NYC we will most probably end up at the W-A again."
282,1969,"Jul 4 2008 	Nice Hotel but worth the money	Well this place is a great location. Close enought to shopping and restaruants but not right next to you so you don't have that much foot traffic around. So given the other reviews, I must have really lucked out. My room was spacious, newer furnishings, beautiful bedding, bathroom with marble counter top and hugh medicine cabinet to store your stuff, two plush bathrobes in the closet and a nice chair and ottoman all provided a wonderful room experience. The staff was courteous but not over accomodating but it is New York. They were, however, able to get me into my room my 1PM so I was thankful for that.Again this is New York, but I still have diffuculity spending $16 for a glass of wine in the lobby bar that is, by the way, pretty noisy. The lack of a coffee maker in the room is amazing in this day and age and while there is a Starbucks in the lobby, I hate to have to get dressed and go down there each morning. The $14.95 daily charge for itnernet usage is part of the nickel and dime stuff that a hotel of this magnitude should not subscirbe. Also beware that when you are quoted the price for the room there are also about 15% additional for various taxes.So it was a nice hotel in a great location but but not worth the additional money."
283,1969,"Jul 2 2008 	Big disappointment	When my company booked me at the Waldorf Astoria for a business trip I was overjoyed. Even though it would be for only one night, it would provide me with an opportunity to stay at this legendary hotel. The lobby, the elevators and the general ambience lived up to the reputation; however the room was a big disappointment.The room was very small, with faded wallpaper and musty carpeting and the window opened out to service chutes with view of piping. The bathroom was tiny and dirty.I am not planning to stay in this hotel in the future"
284,1969,"Jul 1 2008 	Superb	Stayed in The Waldorf Astoria at the end of May 2008 &amp; was rather nervous given that it has more than its fair share of bad reviews, however the whole experience was excellent.Arrived well before the specified check in time but had no problems checking in - there was no queue &amp; we were in our room within 10 minutes of arriving. Luggage turned up 5 minutes later. Reception staff &amp; porters were all very friendly &amp; not at all snooty.we paid for a standard room - Our room was on 27th floor &amp; had a double aspect view up Park Ave towards the park &amp; East towards the river. Room was very spacious, well decorated &amp; furnished &amp; clean. Aircon worked well &amp; unobtrusively. My stay coincided with my birthday &amp; I was sent a complimentary bottle of champagne &amp; chocolate covered strawberries on the day - a nice touch.We also found the concierge service in the lobby very useful for advice on getting around &amp; booking tours etc.My only gripes would be the high cost of room service (We didn't use it there are plenty of reasonable restaurants &amp; delis within 2 minutes walk) &amp; the high cost of the laundry service.overall, highly recommended &amp; well worth the money to stay in a piece of NY history."
285,1969,Jun 27 2008 	Old World...New perspective	No problems at all here. The hotel is extravagant and quite beautiful. I would stay here again in a NY minute.I loved the historic touches and detail that the hotel provides. It's a side of the Big Apple that I have never seen before. Well worth it.
286,1969,"Jun 26 2008 	A Beautiful Piece of history	We were guests at a wedding in the city &amp; the bride &amp; groom chose the Waldorf as their host hotel. We live on Long Island but hadn't stayed at the Waldorf for more than 20 years (we usually stay at the NY Hilton, which we love). I had remembered the Waldorf as having an opulent lobby &amp; tiny, musty rooms. We were pleasantly surprised! Our family had 3 rooms &amp; each one was more than adequate. The size of the rooms, although not large, were certainly not tiny nor musty. The bathrooms were all redone in marble &amp; the bed &amp; bedding were very comfortable. I found the staff to be very accomodating, unlike other reviewers before me. Perhaps because we paid a slightly reduced rate because of the bridal group rate all the things that disturbed other reviewers were inconsequential to us. I still prefer the NY Hilton's rooms, but the history &amp; beauty of the common areas of the Waldorf are something to behold."
287,1969,"Jun 25 2008	Waldorfn Astoria	Spent 2 nights in the Waldorf. Was a bit unsure due some bad reviews on this site. Check in was great and our room was excellent, vWe had a King Deluxe andnit nwas deluxe in everynway. The staff we met were very helpful right down to a man who helped me down a flight of stairs with my case when the elevator was being repaired.Would recommend it to anyone. Try the Hilton.com site for good deals."
288,1969,"Jun 23 2008 	Old and Over-priced	I recently stayed at the Waldorf with my boyfriend as a weekend getaway to NYC. We picked the Waldorf because of location and hotel history. Upon our arrival, there was a long check-in line and after waiting, we found out our room would not be ready for another 2 hours. When we finally were allowed to go to our room, it was very underwhelming. The room was tiny (queen size bed) and outdated. The bathroom was small and the tub/vanity/sink was circa 1970s. Around dinner time, housekeeping insisted on scrubbing the outside of our door for five minutes knowing we were in the room... very awkward. The &quot;luxury&quot; room did not have simple amenities such as coffee maker/ample electrical outlets/slippers. Overall, we were extremely disappointed. It was an experience I would have expected at a $125 per night hotel vs $500+ night experience."
289,1969,"Jun 22 2008 	You can find better quality for your money	This was the third time I stayed in the hotel and on this occasion I was most disappointed.I booked to stay 6 nights but checked out after 3 nights.I found the room in dire need of refurbishment.I was placed on the executive floor and had access to the executive lounge but found a real change in attitude to my previous experiences some 5 years ago.At $600 a night I exspect good quality accomodation with a classy edge, I think this hotel is now lost within the New York market place of posh hotels these days.Previously I found every member of staff greating you with 'good day sir' and the lift had a bell boy and took you to your floor.These little extras made the hotel special.On this occassion I found the staff unfriendly and probally demotivated.I was concerned to the lack of security at the hotel, one would of thought these days that such a high profile hotel would have better security arrangements.So all in all I think prospective guests can find better quality hotels that offer the wow factor for the same if not less room rates.A real shame, I think this hotel is in dire need of a change of management."
290,1969,"Jun 20 2008 	An utter disappointment!	On a recent trip to New York City with friends we decided to indulge in what we thought would be the ultimate splurge and stay at the renowned Waldorf Astoria. We were very excited and after a long day of travelling we were looking forward to settling into a luxurious and comfortable room. What we got was a small, dirty and dated shoebox that was well below our expectations. At over $700USD per night we were shocked. I don't even know where to begin. The carpet was worn and filthy, even coming up from the floor and away from the walls, The walls had stains and marks all over them, the tiny minibar fridge that sat like a box on the floor (not even in a proper wardrobe) had leaked water all over the carpet and our view was over what appeared to be an air shaft. The furnishings are dated beyond belief. The beds need new linens, comforters, pillow shams everthing. It all looks as thought it has been used since the day the hotel opened. I could not believe the overall state of the room. It reminded me of a Super 8 motel room I had once visited in Bangor, Maine. Absolutely dreadful.The bathroom was small, the sink was cracked and the shower had to run for about 20 minutes before we could get any warm water. The toilet barely flushed.I really could not come to terms with the amount of money we spent on this room. We were speechless. Unfortunately we arrived late to the hotel so a room change was not possible at that hour however the next day after voicing our displeasure with reception we were moved.Our second room, although quite nice at first glance, suffered from many of the same signs of age as our first room. We did now have a nice Park Ave view, a large dressing room as well as a few lounge chairs to sit in however there was just not getting past the fact that the rooms are in dire need of an update. Even in our new room the hot water situation was the same and the toilet flushed like it was 1920. Obviously, overall, we were utterly disappointed. To think of how much we spent versus how much satisfaction we got from our stay makes me ill. We were comparing so many properties during the planning phase of this holiday and we spent MORE than necessary simply to stay at the Waldorf and I'm afraid that all you are really paying for is the ability to be able to say &quot;I went to New York City and stayed at the Waldorf Astoria&quot;. A visit to the lobby will suffice if you feel the need to see what all the buzz is about. Beyond the lobby, the hotel is a huge disappointment.Just as an aside, after paying through the nose for the room, the Waldorf then has the audacity to want to charge you $30 if you wish to access the internet from your laptop in the room. Ridiculous. Our last night in the New York area was spent at the Sheraton Newark Airport hotel so that we could be near the airport to catch an early flight. The room cost $140, the internet connection was free and the accomodations were clean, modern and extremely comfortable. I realise Newark airport is not Manhattan however it just goes to show that all you are paying for at the Waldorf is a name and the faded memory of a once 5 star hotel.I would NEVER recommend a stay at the Waldorf , your hard earned money can be spent elsewhere and you will be much happier."
291,1969,"Jun 19 2008 	luxurious position	We spent 4 nights in New York before going down to the Caribbean. Booking one year in a dvance the Waldorf came up cheaper than many below its standard..... You can't fault the location, you can't fault that lovely feeling of history and just 'staying at the Waldorf'.... but the room we had, whilst very large was drab and tired with paint peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom. . I think part if it is undergoing a revamp and it's due. Drinks and food are very pricey at the hotel but there are plenty of local breakfst options if you would prefer to eat elsewhere. If you get a good deal take it, if you don't ,stay at the Marriott!"
292,1969,"Jun 16 2008 	Pros and Cons	I wondered, why the reviews posted here differ so much in rating the hotelrooms and staff. I even supposed some of the (overly positive) reviews being feigned. So, I was a little apprehensive, also because two friends joined us there for over night stays due to my suggestion of this hotel.To begin with, there are many aspects I liked about this hotel. Above all, it is classic and old fashioned and I do like that. The price (329 USD) was good compared to other high class hotels in that mid town location.On arrival, the super shuttle from JFK let us off at the motor entrance. He told us, that a concergie would take care of us. Odd enough, we saw at least six employees waiting and NO one took notice of us and our luggage. So we chose of the side entrances and took our way towards reception.On check-in, waiting time was short and the employee booked us in efficiently and politely. He (probably) upgraded us into a corner room (11th floor in a wing towards 50th street) and took care that our friends arriving two days later would get an adjacent room.The room had a good size, an old closet in the entrance area, a perfect bed, a bath-room with a big shower and a window. There were no curtains at that window, only a blind, which we had to pull down when using the toilet. We reported this to the reception desk, the employee listened carefully, but curtains never appeared throughout the stay. The view was not over impressive but not bad either. It was memorial day with obviously less traffic, no noise disturbed during the night. The air condition was an individual device and a little noisy.House keeping was good, only turn down service was inconsistent (no turn down at all on third night).Some of the lifts did not work properly. Once we got stuck in a lift and had to push the alarm. Good luck, the problem was resolved quickly.We had vouchers for continental breakfast at Oscar's (due to my gold status). The seating procedure proved to be a little fight in order to get a table where we prefered to sit. The buffet was unimpressive and did not keep up with a hotel of high reputation.The Bull and Bear restaurnt's steaks were of huge size, but charred on the surface. One of the steaks (party of four) had a penetrating taste of charcoal. The waiter told us, that this is the typical style they prepare steaks, but he will take that one off the bill. The seating was slightly uncomfortable, because the table was a bit too small for four persons. All tables were on the small side.The last night I detected, that the water on the bath room floor did not stem from our using the shower but was dripping from the ceiling. We reported this in person to the receptionist, who offered us a room change (not for the very last night, too much trouble). She offered us free breakfast (we had the vouchers). So we obtained four vouchers for free drinks at Sir Henry's Bar. I must say, we enjoyed our drinks there greatly. Returning into the room late, I found a message from the receptionist in charge who was concerned about the leakage from the ceilling in our bath room. She offered a room change without moving our luggage and asked me to call back. Well, I was tired (it was late), I did not want to be further away from our friends staying in the neighbour room (we wanted to check out togehter next day, continuing our journey), and I thought it was too much trouble for the very last night. Eventually the leaking stopped since they fixed it in the room above us. - Nevertheless I rose this issue at check out the next day and eventually got 100 USD off the overall bill.The departure was smooth. Our luggage was collected and deposited at the motor entrance. The employee there got us a taxi for four people. That worked well and fast.To cut a long story short: I liked the hotel but it does not live up to its reputation. And that is a pity. Staying here, was a good and fairly nice experience, but it could have been better. Reading other reviews I guess, staying at the Waldorf Towers makes a complete difference. But that is like another (high priced) hotel. They should work towards a more consistent appearance in terms of rooms, maintenance and service."
293,1969,"Jun 13 2008 	Your money could be better spent elsewhere	This was our second stay at the Waldorf and we were less than impressed. We paid an absolute fortune for this stay given it was high season. There were three of us staying, and our first room was basically an old shoe box. We were not happy to see the carpet coming up in places, marked and peeling wallpaper and a cracked sink. We asked to be moved after the first night. Our second room was better - much bigger and not as damaged. But still looking quite old.On the positive side, the lobby of the hotel is very grand and luxurious. Plus its a great location.But next time we'll stay elsewhere - the Waldorf needs extensive renovations before we'll stay again."
294,1969,Jun 10 2008 	Loved the hotel	We stayed at the hotel for Friday and Saturday night for my husband's 50th law school reunion from Columbia U. We were in a short line but a hotel clerk could see my husband was having a problem standing so they ushered us into the Hilton diamond office with no wait at all. We were treated wonderfully and given a very nice room. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and nice. Our room was great. Service was great. The hotel is elegant and beautiful. They sent us a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to celebrate my husband's law school reunion. I can't say enough nice things about this hotel including location
295,1969,"Jun 8 2008	Wonderful Classic Hotel	Our family, which consists of myself, my husband and my two daughters aged 12 and 15 stayed at the Waldorf for 4 nights from 24 May. It was our first time to New York and we all really loved it. The Hotel is very classic so anyone wanting contemporary will not be happy. However I liked it and prefer the old style. The room was rather dusty around the fixtures and fittings but the bathroom was cleaned well every day and we always had the room done by the time we returned from our outings and fresh towels. The maid came in the evening to take off the bedspreads as it was warm at night. The size of the room was adequate as it was a standard room. We had 2 double beds but we had a seperate dressing room and the bathroom was next to that so we all had privacy when required. We had room service a couple of times and that was very prompt and the food was lovely. All the staff we encountered were very well mannered and helpful. We used the safety deposit box facility which is free and found it useful to safeguard money and passports etc. Taxis were outside the Hotel to take to you to wherever you wanted to go and they are very cheap. We had a great time and will return!!"
296,1969,"Jun 8 2008 	A nice stay	We decided to stay at the Waldorf Astoria during our trip to New York because it was not that much more expensive than other hotels and the location was great. There were three of us in a room with two double beds. It wasn't giant, but it was large enough to be comfortable for three people.The best part of our stay were the beds, because they were some of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept on. The location was also great, with plenty of attractions within walking distance, and the subway close by.There were only two things to worry about. One was the constant static electricity we built up due to the plush carpets throughout the hotel. We kept getting shocked every time we touched metal.The second was the maids who were quite insistent upon coming in to turn down the sheets around 6pm, even when we asked them not to. They seemed to be blatently pressing for tips. Tipping was in general expected among the staff, so be prepared for it with some spare bills.We didn't use the restaurants in the hotel as they were more expensive than other places in the area.In general I would recommend this hotel to anyone, but note that it is not the cheapest in the world. But how many times can you stay in a place that is also a tourist attraction itself?"
297,1969,"Jun 5 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location	Perfect for anybody who wants a large , luxurious hotel in a great location. Was extremely impressed with the impeccable service and friendly staff who go out of their way to make you feel welcome.Our stay was enhanced by the fact that we were upgraded on our arrival to the boutique Waldorf Towers at no extra cost. The hotel is usually very busy with business meetings, wedding receptions, graduation parties etc and can appear quite formal and as such may not suit everybody, however this is only a minor gripe and didn't detract from our stay at all. Overall it was a pleasure to stay in such a landmark hotel. Highly recommended."
298,1969,"Jun 5 2008 	Loved the Atmosphere	The Waldorf is a traditional style of hotel and probably some of the furnishings in the room are a bit tired looking but overlook that and it is a fantastic experience to stay there. The bed was really comfy and the room very quiet. There was always something happening in the hotel and I could have sat all day in the lobby, people watching. Sir Harry's bar does a mean G &amp; T which was worth the $16. Great location. We bought an open top bus ticket for 3 days and used it like public transport from right outside the hotel. Ate in the Bull &amp; Bear one night and wouldn't really recommend. Great local places for breakfast. Loved New York and thought the Waldorf made the trip really special."
299,1969,"Jun 2 2008	Loved it!!	We booked a 2 bedroom mini suite and were not disappointed. We spent one week here and it was wonderful. Large bedroom, separate living room with a TV in each. 2 bathrooms and large walk in closet. It was all clean and nicely decorated. Check in/ check out was very quick. We were on the 22nd floor but those lifts are so fast it wasnt a problem. The iron in the room was broken but when my daughter reported it a new one was brought within minutesWe had buffet breakfast on morning which was lovely. We also ordered meals from room service twice. Both times it was delivered quickly and was very hot. More than enough food, with all the little touches included.We were treated well by all staff, and the location is perfect. walking distance to all the major attractions"
300,1969,"May 31 2008 	The worst nice hotel in the world	I am a Hilton Diamond member so I try to stay at Hilton Hotels. For the last few years I've stayed at the Hilton on Avenue of the Stars and it was fine, but I thought I'd try Hilton's &quot;premier&quot; NYC property the famed Waldorf Astoria. This will be the one and only time I make that mistake. Straight up, this place is nowhere near as nice as the Hilton a few blocks over (which is no gem but merely serviceable) and WAY over-rated.I had a 6th floor room with a view of anything other than a rooftop. Fine, not a big deal but the floor was also being used to host a conference of some kind and there were tables set up in the hall all the time of my stay and a constant procession of wait staff setting up things for the conference. When I got to the room neither the TV nor the Air Conditioner worked. I called about both. They fixed the TV but didn't do anything about the A/C. (The TV here is a old tube not like the sexy flat screen a the &quot;lesser&quot; Hilton a few blocks away). I called again about the A/C the next morning and they said they'd fix it .. but nothing again. The morning of my last night there, I called again. When I got in from my meetings at the end of the day, they had installed a crappy window unit air conditioner in the room. It was extremely loud and was letting in heat in the side spaces where it didn't quite fit in the window. I called and complained and told them I wanted my rate reduced. They agreed to give me my last night free. Of course, when the bill came under the door it included my last night so I had to go wait in line and manually check out in order to get that night removed (And explain the whole experience again). I've actually never answered the question &quot;how was your stay?&quot; with the answer &quot;not good&quot; before until now .... at worst, I would say &quot;fine&quot; to the person checking me out but I just couldn't hold my tongue. Eventually they got the bill right. But at $525 per night, this was a joke. So many better places for this price. I KNEW I wasn't staying at the Four Seasons, but surely they can beat their very own Hilton a few blocks away!?! What a joke. I'll never go there again and am thinking of abandoning the chain entirely."
301,1969,"May 30 2008 	Top class hotel!!	We have just returned from a stay at the waldorf astoria and want to say what a wonderful time we have had. The check was easy, even though our room wasnt ready until 3pm, they had upgraded us and made mention of our anniversary and told us we were down as vip guests. (I had emailed the hotel prior to arrival to inform them of our special occasion) When we went back at 3pm our room still wasnt ready so because we were tired, we agreed to pay a nominal fee to upgrade to a suite. The room was beautiful, very elegant, it had a sitting room and a lovely bedroom. The furniture was in no way dated as suggested in previous reviews, it suited the grandeur of the place - maybe these other reviewers prefer the crisp pristine look of a boutique hotel and the classy look does not appeal? On the day of our anniversary the hotel sent us champagne and chocolate strawberries with a rose and card wishing us all the very best. What a lovely touch! We were extremely happy with everything. The breakfast was lovely, lots to choose from at the buffet and the waiting staff were efficient beyond words. No wonder Americans can seem quite impatient in a restaurant in the uk if this is the service they have come to expect! All in all it is a wonderful place, very very clean and elegant and we would not hesitate to stay there again. The staff in no way looked down on you, in fact we would say quite the opposite. If you get the chance to stay there do not worry - as long as you appreciate the history of the hotel and its intended style you will certainly not be disappointed. Cannot wait to go back!"
302,1969,"May 28 2008 	Very enjoyable	Stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in feburary for my 30th birthday as a surpise weekend from my wife. We had an excellent corner room with with windows on two walls. The room was comfortable and of a good size and clean. The staff are very good and helpful.We ate at the japanese restaurant , in the hotel, on the saturaday which was my birthday which was very good with a nice atmosphere .The location was great we were able to walk everywhere."
303,1969,"May 26 2008 	Doesn't get any better ...	There is an elegance to the grand old hotels like the Waldorf and the Plaza that is simply unmatched. So when you get the opportunity you simply cant pass it up. We came across a great rate (&lt; $350 a night) over this Memorial Day weekend. It was first class all the way. PROS:. Rooms are large. Linens and bedding were great. Lot of hot water and good water pressure. Small refrigerator in the room (great for water and sodas). Complimentary continental breakfast (upgradeable to full breakfast for $6). Elevators are fast and all elevators were operational all the time. Entire staff was friendly, courteous, and helpfulCONS:. No shower caps for the wife. Wallpaper a bit worn but not a distraction"
304,1969,May 24 2008 	Love the Waldorf	We loved the Astoria - all our experience with the staff was of the highest standard from check-in to check-out time. Concierge were great and always helpful.Would definitely stay here again - not only for the grandeur of the hotel but also the location.
305,1969,"May 23 2008 	World Class... but worth the price?	My wife and I stayed at the Waldorf=Astoria in April. My parents stayed their about 25 years agoand I had always wanted to stay their. We're from Las Vegas and we've stayed in many luxury hotels all over the country. This Hotel was exceptional, especially when you consider the history of the building.We need to get one thing straight. The Waldorf=Astoria is OLD. If you're expecting everything to look shiny and new, you'll be disappointed. If, however, you are willing to accept the fact that you're in a well kept piece of American history, and not the Disney/Vegas-based hotel/resort, you'll be in good shape.The hotels does have its pros and cons.To be honest, I probably wouldn't stay at the Waldorf again on my own dime. The place is full of history and really lets you peek into what the &quot;old guard&quot; must have marveled at in it's day. The entire hotel drips with history and old world charm that makes it very obvious as to why its considered the &quot;Gand-dame&quot; of hotels. But for a regular guy like me who wants to squeeze as much luxury as i can get for my dollar, it may seem like a waste of money.Though my wife and I agree that the service and staff were all phenominal. We just couldn't bring ourselves to spend $8.50 for a glass of Sprite and $14 for an Amstel light at the bar. The $95 per person Sunday Brunch buffet had us very puzzled, as we've both been to some of the greatest buffets in the country and never paid more than $30 per.If you're a business traveler and have a decent expense account, the Waldorf may be for you as the hotel seems to be really concentrating on large meeting and conferences, which with corperate sponsorship, would make more sense for some of the prices.The area itself is just about perfect if you want to be close to the action, but not RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of it.A ten minute walk will get you to Times Square, which in my opinion is just an unkempt Disney-type property. Every piece of wall is covered with some sort of advertisement designed to catch your eye, and there are thousands of ads trying to out-do eachother to get you attention, so all together you look at everything and focus on nothing. Though it is quite the spectacle, Times Square epitomizes that universal image of NYC; almost overwhelming.Before you get to Times Square from the hotel you'll run in to Rockefeller Center. Top of the Rock is a must do. Beware of the creepy security guard at the top who REALLY seems to like to take pictures of couples kissing with the view of the city in the background.My wife and I couldn't stop laughing because he kept moaning &quot;yeah, yeah, kiss her again&quot;. Friendly guy though!Walk over a few blocks to the east of the hotel and there are several privately owned restaurants that won't hurt your wallet.We really liked Ristoranta Lazagna. Great specials and amazing Lazagna, especially for the price.We also enjoyed the Grayline Hop-on/off bus tours.If you walk into this the the mind set that you're going to get to see the city from a bit better view than what you would in a cab, you'll appreciate it a bit more. Don't expect much more aside from that.What more advice can I give you? Don't be afraid to eat off the street carts. Try the gyro guy a block west of Rockefeller Center. Try Ray's Pizza on 7th Ave btwn 53rd and 54th st. and have a slice.Try the original Grimaldi's Pizza in Brooklyn. Friendly staff and great pizza.Don't be afraid of the subway, It's very easy to learn the system, and most people will gladly help you find your way around.Try everything!!! It's New York City!!Last last bit of advice is to take comfortable shoes. In NYC you never realize how much you've walked until the end of the day. If you like to explore as we did, your feet will thank you if you leave the dress shoes in your suitcase and wear those walking shoes."
306,1969,"May 22 2008 	This is how it is - Fantastic!	I stayed here for a girls trip in 2007 and loved it so much went back this year, little did we know the hotel could only be better than before! And no it didnt cost the earth at all, for 5 nights we paid less than 600 between us which for this hotel is amazing!On arrival we were dropped off at the underground section, somthing we hadn't had in 2007, we were met by a 'welcomer' to the hotel who greated us, had our bags taken to our room, walked us throught the hotel and checked us in while we sat and relaxed on the sofas. He came with us to the room, and after saying we would like a bigger one, just because our room in 2007 was slightly larger, he made a call and we were moved to a large suit and had strawberrys and bubbly arrive at our room as a welcome gift. Anything we wanted he looked after us. All other staff were amazing. My friend and i love the old world style of the hotel, the fact that all the furnature is not new and Ikea looking is what i want from the hotel, the grandure of it all makes you feel special,ALL the staff are amazing and the beds better than any i have ever slept in! We never dress up in the day and never feel out of place at all, never looked down on and only given respect by ALL the staff!On leaving the hotel in Jan we did have a slight issue, only minor with regards to our luggage as we left, i recieved an email from the hotel asking for my opinions on the hotel and detailed my minor issue. Within 3 days i had the director of the hotel on the phone to me in the UK to discuss the matter and express his regret...and this was only a tiny issue i raised!! He knew i was returning to the hotel in Feb and on my arrival, to my suprise, met me to further appologise, upgraded my room and when i checked out left a note to say on my next visit i would get another upgrade and a free night, so if you dont like something in the hotel tell them and they will do everything they can to make it better for you!! Oh and the welcomer from my visit in january spotted me in the hotel and welcomed me back, sent more bubbly to the room and gave us any info or help we needed....all the customers he would see but he remembered me and greated me by name! Thats the kind of personal touch i would never have expected in a hotel that size but it just shows the level of class with its employees. All staff from the door staff to housekeeping were fantastic and would do anything for you.I would not stay anywhere else in New York. Its location is amazing, the experiance is one of a kind and above all you feel safe within the hotel which is important in any city you stay in, more so when its two young women traveling alone.I am not a visitor to the hotel who as one reviewer wrote 'is on the billionaires list' but i am always given the attention from the staff that makes my stay more than i would expect. If you are going to New York please give this hotel a chance it will do nothing but make your trip more special."
307,1969,"May 21 2008 	Beautiful and very pricey	First off, I have to say the reservations and billing department are fabulous when you contact them. They are very helpful, courteous, and patient with first time customers.The hotel is beautiful and located in a good area for sight seeing and transportation choices. The flowers in the reception area are incredible; you can smell them as you walk in the door.My friend and I could only afford a standard room. It was definitely standard. You must remember that this is an old hotel, and there will be flaws in your room. However, our room was very quite with no street noise whatsoever- which is a PLUS.The staff is very helpful and courteous.The restaurants and bars at the hotel are VERY expensive. We ordered martinis at $20 a piece. Needless to say, we only had one. There is a Starbucks tucked away downstairs. Better yet, we found a great deli a block a way.We will never stay here again because of the expense and we will opt for something more updated next time, but we are glad that we had the experience."
308,1969,"May 20 2008 	World Class	I spent my entire life in the hotel industry, 22 years of that as a general manager for a large hotel chain. I have always wanted to stay at the Waldorf. I booked a girlfriends weekend there in March. I was not disappointed. The staff was first rate from beginning to end. The history of the hotel and it's &quot;presence&quot; were amazing. The room was enormous, especially for NYC. Maybe someday I will be able to return to this gem of a hotel... Don't hesitate to stay there and when you do, savor all of the history, people and amenities this hotel has to offer."
309,1969,"May 15 2008 	Landmark hotel some issues	I booked my reservation through the hotel- there was a special discount which applied if you used a Visa card. Upon arrival we were greeted to a very crowded lobby. But hey this is NYC and what can you expect. The line moved quickly and we were able to check in. However the price I was quoted on the phone when I made my reservation was not the same upon check in (it was corrected) The staff at the front desk was excellent-polite efficient and no attitudes. When I booked the room I specifically asked if there was a fold out bed. I was told all suites had fold out beds. No such luck. They did bring up two cots which were provided at no charge(usually a 50.00 charge each). We stayed in a corner suite and the room was excellent. Couple of small issues- the furniture was dirty and could stand to be cleaned and even on the 13th floor the room was noisy. The concierges were useless, usually concierges in a NYC hotel are helpful and knowledgeable. And I expected the same from a large hotel like the Waldorf. I called about a week or so ahead of time to see if they had any pull at a particular restaurant and the concierge could not have been less helpful. To quote, &quot;Its not like they are holding any tables for us&quot; well no [--]. During our stay I asked one of the concierges about the address for Brooks Brothers and what the cross street was- no clue what Brooks Brothers was!! She aked me to spell it for her and then she had to google it-I eventually just walked away. Overall the staff at the hotel was great the exception being the dopey concierge staff.Also Bull and Bear drinks are outrageously expensive. I've been to NY many times but even I was a little surprised at 18.00 for a gin and tonic and 20.00 for a maritni. But the atmosphere is very NY and the bartender was excellent.I like the Waldorf- its busy but it is a landmark and the location is great."
310,1969,"May 13 2008 	Wow what a place to start your trip	We have just returned from a holiday to New England and decided to start our trip with three nights in New York, so we thought where else than the Waldorf. We booked directly with the hotel, but then after visiting the Trip Advisor reviews we were more than a little worried by what we read. No need, we arrived at the Waldorf to be greeted by a delightful bell boy, who introduced himself and said if there was anything he could do, we only needed to ask. Check in was swift, and within 10 minutes we were in our room, which was delightful, lovely furnishings and bathroom everything we had hoped for. During our stay the concierge station was always helpful with theatre tickets and restaurants for dinner. They recommended a really nice Italian and the food was excellent. I can't praise this hotel enough, no wonder a lot of the staff are long standing. You can tell."
311,1969,"May 13 2008 	Disappointing tired and overrated.	I know I am late in writing this, but as I have not received anyreply from the hotel in over a year after writing to them several times via email and completing their feedback form several times, I want to write about our experience. Hopefully they have renovated by now. This was supposed to have been a wonderful experience for our 30th wedding anniversary in the great Waldorf Astoria. We had saved up to go to New York for ages. We arrived jetlagged after more than 24 hours flying,late at night to a tiny room that greeted us with a massive stain on the carpet that had seen better days. The paint was peeling and the bathroom had make up all over the door and basin. I used the toilet and it got blocked, very blocked, so we called reception who said they would get a plumber. By this time, we were beside ourselves with tiredness. We asked if we could have another room to go to sleep and were told no as it should not be long. The room was like a sauna all night and we slept in by 30 minutes(having slept about 2 hours in all) so we missed the buffet breakfast that we had paid for months before. They said all they could offer us was coffee and sweet pastries. It was such a waste of money, hard earned money. I have stayed in better hotels here for 1/4 of the price. The most disappointing thing when I look back is that there were no apologies of any sort. Not even a simple reply to the numerous emails..... We love New York, but never again will we stay at the Waldorf Astoria."
312,1969,"May 12 2008 	Loved the whole experience!	We stayed at the Waldorf for 4 nights in April, 2008. I had reviewed the comments on this site, and was skeptical but, we decided to go for it. We are so glad we did! It was absolutely everything we could hope. We had a two room suite which was better than what I expected. The rooms were very well decorated, with a large and updated bathroom. The lobby of course is exceptional, and it was great to just walk through it each day. We found the staff to be very professional and friendly. I can't quite understand comments from others about snobby attitudes. We experienced none of that , and found the opposite to be quite true. We ate lunch the first day at Oscar's waiting for our room to be ready (it was extremely busy that day) and at at the Bull and the Bear twice, because we enjoyed it so much the first time. We found the service in the restaurants beyond reproach. They even helped us not to over-order! Of coure, that type of attitude encouraged us to return on our last night, so the restaurant lost nothing in terms of money. On our last night, we had a window table and sat for hours enjoying the ambience. We certainly can't afford to stay there often, but, on our next trip to New York, we will definitely return to the Waldorf. We loved New York, can't wait to return, and the Waldorf helped make our stay all that it was."
313,1969,"May 7 2008 	Thank God for Travel Points!	We spent 4 nights at the Waldorf Astoria (WA) in a suite on the 9th floor. We were using travel miles that had accumulated over 9 months time. This was my third trip to NYC, and we loved the WA's location. The lobby and its expanding hallways are magnificantly furnished. The entire place had that &quot;old money&quot; feel. Our checkin was quick, but we didn't have our confirmation page with us. We were told to provide it before we left or we would be charged $910 a day. We were not required to have bell service with our bags. We were given 4 free passes for a drink/Bull and Bear or for a breakfast/Oscar's. We took the drink tickets and headed down to the Bull and Bear. Our wine was $14 a glass. The three of us had dinner for a grand total of $333. Two of us had the filet for $50 each. It was terrific, but it could have been a smaller cut for less money. The lobster soup was first a dollop of lobster served in a bowl with garnish. The server then came back and poured the bisque into the bowl. Fabulous! We tried the waldorf salad, but it was basically a partial red and green apple slivered for $17? My friend had just had a birthday, so she picked up the tab as her celebration. One of us is a smoker so we were going down the elevator a lot at night to smoke at the ground level parking entrance. We wound up making friends with the valet staff. There is also a private entrance down there for upscale clientele. One night we saw Donatella Versace and her daughter, Allegra. Room Service: We didn't want to pay $8 for a small pot of coffee (3 cups) delivered to the room...plus a 15% gratuity and a $5.25 service charge. Instead we headed across the street/outside on 50th Street to Starbucks. $2.11 for a Grande/including tax. Later on we found out there was a Starbucks in WA, but their prices were higher. Suite: There were beautiful tapestry pillows and bed runners on the beds. The first time we returned to our room after being out all day, we found our beds turned down with the music playing at the IPOD station. We enjoyed the scented body lotion left for our use in the bathroom. The bathroom lacked a fan for ventilation. We kept joking about the price of what the WA charged for any kind of laundry service. $9 to wash a pair of panties?In the end, all we had to pay for was our internet service. It was well worth the visit."
314,1969,"May 6 2008 	Friendly Waldorf	We have just returned from a 4 night stay which was booked as a surprise for my birthday. I found about the trip 2 days before we went, came straight on here to check it out and was apprehensive to say the least, after some of the reviews!Get the not so good out of the way first - our taxi was directed round the side, and no-one gave us directions to reception so we stumbled around for a while. One evening in the bar the barman looked a bit sniffy at our 15% tip on 2 drinks. And my parents had a problem with their room.Good bits - Fabulous lobby - very grand and beautiful. Every member of staff we had contact with was extremely friendly, polite and professional. We got some great advice on where to eat, and excellent help with everything we asked - cancelling a restaurant booking we had made elsewhere, directions, booking return flight seats - nothing was too much trouble!Our room was spacious, and we had a corner room, so 1 window that overlooked other room windows, and the other with a view down Park Avenue. Big TV, great radio / clock, and a really comfortable bed. There was a room service note to say they would change the sheets every 3 days unless we asked them to change more often, but they changed the linens every day anyway. Our bathroom was small, but looked like an original bathroom, which we thought was nice - it was small, but fine for 2 people. Good turndown service - bedside lights are turned on, and the radio is left on low so its almost like youre returning home. Maybe if I were to be picky I could say that the decor was a bit faded, but if we wanted sparkle and modern we would have stayed at the W or the Hyatt.MY parents twin room was large with a gorgeous bathroom, but they did have a problem, and when they spoke to reception they were immediately moved to a suite which was beautiful. Their problem was handled swiftly and professionally - perfect!We didnt find the hotel, the other guests,or the staff stuffy or snobby in the least. There were functions going on every day, and we just marvelled at the management that this took. It was lovely to see people all dressed up in their finery, and yet we didnt feel out of place at all. Some of the reviews had said you would be out of place if you werent dressed up in designer clothes at all times, but I dont see that - I saw people in jeans and trainers, flip flops, and shorts and t shirts just back from running, and no-one batted an eye. Some of the retaurants have a dress code, but thats to be expected, isn't it?!There is a starbucks just to the left of the main doors that opens at 6.30. If you are from the UK, and youre awake before then and need your coffee fix faster, go right out the main doors, turn right at the end and there is another Starbucks 50 yards down which opens earlier!Take a trip up to see the ballroom and the Starlight room - both are amazing!!"
315,1969,"May 6 2008 	Starbucks paper cups and snobby staff	What a beautiful Art Deco lobby! ... it seems to be one of the NYC top sights. Get a coffee from Starbucks located next to thePark Avenue entrance and sit down comfortably in the lobby and enjoy.Afterwards leave the paper cup somewhere, on the stairs for example.The staff is so snobby they won't even notice You (unless You are mentioned on the world's billionaires list), so no problem! ...and You have been able to enjoy the best W=A has to offer - for a reasonable price!There is no reason why You should stay at this hotel:as already mentioned the staff is snobbish and uninterested in serving a guest (however not at the bar!)During my five days stay at the hotelI didn't receive a single smile from a staff member.The rooms are very outdated and depressing. The overall room standard was surprisingly low - even at the higher room category (superior).A very modest turn down service occured every second evening.Bathroom toiletteries (mixed!) where changed once during my stay.In the bar, Sir Henry's, You can expect to find all a tired travelingsalesman needs after a long day (however even here the standard was surprisingly low!) ...and of course a good selection of liquors, as well.In brief: once You leave the lobby (although with those paper cups) there are no signs of a world known luxury hotel anywhere- at least not below the Waldorf Towers floors."
316,1969,"May 5 2008 	Classic hotel but no 5-star	I very much looked forward to staying at the W=A given that I had heard that they had refurbished the hotel. The common areas, including the ballrooms have been cleaned up to reflect the original style (classic modern architecture) and, while not my style, they did a nice job. The rooms, however seemed to have been overlooked. Wallpaper seams were exposed in the room and bathrooms. Basic fixtures did not get replaced (i.e., toilet paper holder or smoke alarms that have a kahaki color that comes from plastic getting old) so they looked like a bad Motel 6. And, much of the furniture had clearly not been addressed (e.g., dings and scratches in the wood, backings coming off of the armoires, etc.). The staff was friendly and the food was great, so it is a good place to visit....especially from a historical perspective. But if you are looking for a 5-star hotel, suggest staying somewhere else."
317,1969,"May 5 2008 	Glad I stayed will I will try somewhere else next time.	I really am glad I stayed, but next time I will stay in a newer hotel.Check in was easy and quick all the staff we came across were very friendly. I went to New York with my mum, sister, 2 children and husband. I stayed in a king size room which was bigger than the 2 x double bedroom. The beds were very comfortable.No kettle in the room but if you phone down for one they will bring one up for you, but no tea, coffee, milk or sugar you need to bring your own!! We had no view out side our window.Shampoo, conditioner, soap and body lotion and a hair dryer 2 x bath robes and towels are provided. The rooms do need redecorating, but it is what it is, a very old, well know hotel which every one should stay at! The lobby is very impressive and grand ,old money springs to mind. There are a lot of business and very well dressed people in the hotel I wish I had taken my nice clothes instead of causal sight seeing ones. The hotel is very well located 2 blocks from rockafella centre. we did not eat at the hotel, but at the restaurant in the Raddison hotel down the road."
318,1969,"May 4 2008 	Great Hotel	3rd May 2008We have just returned from a week at the Waldrof Astoria, New York.What a fabulous place, without doubt it must be one of the best hotels of its kind in the world. Not a glass and modern minimalistic boring place, but one steeped in history and grandier that you don't find in many places today.When we arrived we were greeted with a very warm welcome from the receptionist, who didn't take long to go through all the details of the booking. Our room was a bit small for a weeks stay, but no problem ,we returned to reception to ask for a bigger room and although they couldn't do anything that day told us that after 3pm the following day they would have a superior room for us to view.After viewing the room we were very pleased indeed and took it straight away.We found all the hotel staff more than happy to answer any questions we asked,The room was cleaned every day and the bedding changed every other day, and turned back every evening. Yes you do find that the hotel is very busy with business people, but thats one of the things you have to put up with as these people and there companies are the ones that are probably keeping this hotel going.No, we didn't find them intimatating as we also saw how pleased some of the were to be in such a lovely hotel, and they to were taking photographs of the lobby and asking passing guests to take a photo of them in the hotel.Please except it as a pleasant experience as we did. How is wish we could go backAnn DaviesSwansea"
319,1969,"May 1 2008 	Classic New York Experience	My husband and I had always wanted to stay in NYC around the holidays so we cashed in some Hilton Honors points and stayed at the Waldorf. The building and lobby are beautiful and dramatic. The location can't be beat for all the mid-town touristy sites. However, the room decor could use some updating but was very richly decorated. We also didn't care much for the clientele - the Waldorf is not necessarily for those who want the best, it's for those who want everyone to know they spent the most. Though we are fairly well off for our age, I felt out of place for not wearing a full-length mink coat or a 10 carat Harry Winston diamond. The staff was also snobbish towards us for not being a member of the New York elite. New York is full of hotels - I'm sure there's another one that also has history and a great location minus the snobbery."
320,1969,"Apr 30 2008 	Dissapointed	Arrived after a long weary flight to find a long line waiting the check-in, which seemed to take an age. The receptionist insisted in going through an extensive briefing (selling) on what was available at extra cost. The room we were assigned, at $514 per night, was not reflective of cost. It's a fine old establishment, but the service level needs review as I found out one evening trying to get a drink at the lobby bar, Sir Henry's, when the bar man informed me that he was extremely busy and asked if I wanted him to &quot;split himself in 3&quot; to get served. I alerted management who did not appear surprised that this had happened. I would recommend a visit, but stay somewhere else."
321,1969,"Apr 29 2008 	Great Location Aging rooms	We stayed in Room 905 for one night 4/26/08. We received a free upgrade to a king room for $299 a night, but our room was not available until after 4pm. Not a huge problem, b/c we left our suitcases with porters and went sightseeing---until the next morning when housekeeping banged on our room door at 8:30am--how is it that the room is not ready until 4pm, but housekeeping starts before 9am?Room service arrived promptly and the portions were adequate.The bed was super comfortable and was turned down. We had a king bed, chair with ottoman, flat screen TV, walk in closet, desk and chair. All in all, it was the largest hotel room we have ever had in NYC. The decor is aging, the carpet was worn around the edges and the draperies were 1960s granny style.All service personnel are polite, welcoming, helpful and sincere. There was a Denzel Washington movie filming at the hotel, which meant that the Park Ave entrance was closed periodically, which made it difficult to hail cabs. The Starbucks is convenient, but a venti nonfat latte cost over $6, almost double the normal fee.We would probably stay at the Waldorf again due to the size of the room and the location, and would expect superior service but a dated room."
322,1969,"Apr 26 2008 	visit but don't stay	secod time to the waldorf first time twenty years ago wish i had left it at that. reception looked very grand with all the christmas decorations up. staff lovely and very helpfull then we got to our suite reality set in, like visiting your grannys house that she has'nt decorated since the early seventies not grand antiques just plain cheap and nasty. great location and fab to tell people your staying at the waldorf but expect to be underwhelmed and you will not be dissapointed"
323,1969,"Apr 20 2008	5 Star Rip Off	I booked with a friend for a very special trip (significant birthday) and took one of their experience packages, which was the most truthful thing about the stay, it was an experience. Grubby suite, bed not made (just the sheets straightened, no comforter put on or pillows, but it did mean that they didn't need to do a turn down at night!). Draughty (the maintenance man came at 11pm and put gaffer tape around the windows to stop the draught). Two ancient TVs - why?? - tiny shower room in this suite for 4 (we were fortunately only two and no toiletries. Room not tidied or vaccuumed. The hotel was just faded. 2 concierge on duty for hundreds of people, long queues every day. Expensive, not worth it and I wouldn't bother, in fact I so wouldn't bother that they have given me one night in a 'luxury suite' and I am certainly 'not bothered' to return. Good if you want a Starbucks on site as they have one in the basement so you can sit on the stairs with your paper cup and eat a muffin out of a paper bag - nice."
324,1969,"Apr 17 2008 	Mixed feelings about the Waldorf	Okay, after reading a few reviews on here prior to going, I had mixed emotions about what we were going to expect at the Waldorf.I, myself, am a Travel Agent within the UK so I have been trained to always go somewhere with an open mind.The check-in was speedy and perfect however it did go a little down hill from there.The room we were given was 'dated' and not what I'd expect at such a famous and well recommended hotel.As we were there for 'tourist 5-days' we always felt out of place within the hotel as it was mainly full of buisness people carrying briefcases and chatting loudly on their mobile phones in posh Armarni suits. We were (more than once) looked at like we smelled of dirty poo, even though we were dressed quite smartly.The bad thing is, is that I've booked the Waldorf to stay in for my wedding in May and it was too late to cancel it and find somewhere different.Fair enough, the hotel was in a very good location and if it wasnt for the dated room with a crap view and the nasty stares from the other guests then the stay would of been great.The bonus you have within the hotel is it has a Starbucks inside which is a must for the 'City that never sleeps'.Anyone needed any further info or for recommendations on other hotels in NYC, please feel free to contact me."
325,1969,"Apr 17 2008	A good base in NYC	Considering what a huge hotel this is, service is remarkably efficient and personalized. Everything we needed or wanted was promptly provided. Our updated room had a nice view of St Barts. Other reviewers have talked about a lack of heat. This certainly was not our experience. Food and drink are not cheap, but considering this is a grand old hotel in New York what do you expect? All in all a good base from which to explore Manhattan"
326,1969,"Apr 16 2008 	Not 5 Star!!	Just Came back from a long weekend trip to USA. On the way back from a hotel conference in Las Vegas, we stopped in New York for 4 nights. In Vegas I stayed in The Venetian, stayed in a suite, and it was great as well as the rest of the hotel.When arriving to Waldorf Astoria, they did not have the room that i had requested. BUT they offered to upgrade me to a junior suite for only 100 USD extra per nnight, and i accepted this. When seeing the room i was very disappointed, not really any bigger than any normal hotel room, and in need of refurbishment. As it was late, and i had a dinner appointment that night, i did not have time to waiste complaining to reception. The following morning i was woken up very early by building work outside. This was confirmed by reception....who amazingly admitted they knew this when they upgraded me to this room.I was given another STANDARD room, now on the other side of the hotel. Very small....and I had to call reception again later that day as the water was stuck in my bath!On departure day we checked out before 10 am as we were told. We were offered to store our luggage till we had to leave for JFK. When arriving back in the afternoon to pick up my luggage, I was told to wait outside on Park Avenue where Taxis would be found, and they would bring out my luggage. Well!!!....after waiting 20 minutes, i asked the doorman if he could find out what happened with my luggage, so he went in to find &quot;investigate&quot;. As he never came back, after waiting another 15 minutes, i went in to the bell desk AND soon found out that nobody knew where my receip for luggage had gone missing!!!! and nobody came out to tell me....but instead i had to follow somebody down to the garage and luggage room to identify my luggage!!!Just to add to the story, my friend who also had attended the hotel conference in Vegas, also had to request a room change when we arrived to Waldorf Astoria.They might live on their name/brand, but not worth it!Lots of other great hotels in the area!!!E.S"
327,1969,"Apr 16 2008 	Ummmm...not sure	So, where do I start. First off, everyone should have the experience of staying at the waldorf at least once in their life. The lobby is AMAZING. I felt like a ultra rich person as I checked in.Now the average news....everyone who's written on this website so far is correct. There are good things and there are bad things.I paid for a mini-suite and wound up in a handicapped room with absolutely NO VIEW. It was the view of the inner core of the hotel. YUCK. No sun coming thru at all. Then waking up one morning to workers inside this &quot;core&quot; yelling all morning.It was 75 degress and no air conditioning. The next day it was 50 and no heat. I called and they said that they have no heat/ac at this time of year so they'd send somebody up to open the windows. YIPPEE! (sarcasm)I called the next day to complain that my room was not a mini-suite as promised. No sitting area's, just 2 double beds. They said they would move me, but I said, I just want some money back. I was in no mood to move. They wouldn't do it since I didn't pay thru their website. Instead, I got offered an upgrade on my next visit.The pro's:1) beds are wonderful2) the room was clean3) It was quiet (for the most part)4) It was not in the middle of times square. And there is something to be said about that.5) Beautiful lobby - elegantThe con's:1) disappointed in the suite I paid for (not as indicated on their website)2) No heating or AC3) Took 1 hour to get my luggage4) I arrived at 1 and didn't get into my room until 3:30 after standing in line 3 times5) Having to take the back route to my room due to events happening in the lobby6) The shower too forever to heat up and since it was a handicapped room, I felt like I was taking a shower in a large closet.Location was pretty good.I went to the bull and bear to have the famous Waldorf salad and it was about 3/4 cup of salad with 4 walnuts. I had 1 glass of wine and the salad and my bill was $35.I think I would rather book an event there than stay there."
328,1969,"Apr 14 2008 	Fantastic Place - Will be going again.	We went on a five night stay to New York (First Time) we had no idea on what to expect. When we arrived underneath the hotel we where helped with the bags from a friendly porter, and directed to the lobby. The lobby itself was very very impressive! Booking in was a breeze with the amount of desks open and with smiling people standing behind them ,was a nice change from England with scowling people :)We had a room on the 13th floor the lifts are alot faster than in the UK i'm pretty sure, we got into the room to find the maid turning down the bed for us(nice touch). The room itself was very clean and tidy the bed was very very comfortable, the bathroom was spotlessly clean! Everywhere in the hotel was just impeccable, no matter where you looked there was cleaners busy!All the staff are excellent and very friendly, the concierge was excellent made our stay effortless as we'd ask for a good resturant and 5 minutes later it would be booked at whatever time we asked for.Location was very central so i couldnt have asked for more from the hotel and when I do go back to New York I know what hotel i'll be booking.New York is fantastic!"
329,1969,"Apr 14 2008 	Waldorf Astoria - OK if you're a ""Pretty Woman""?	Myself and my friend stayed from 9th to 13th April 2008. This was a special trip for our 30th and 60th birthdays so I wanted somewhere we could both enjoy.First impression was it was a great location. Out taxi pulled up at the grand entrance and was then asked to move to a different entrance not once but twice. So at the third attempt we were directed through the scaffolding at the side of the building (now affectionately known as the tradesmans' entrance!) and up to reception where we were advised room was not ready but hey took our mobile and said they would call when it was...no call but we did not mind as we took a great carriage ride around Central Park instead ($34 for 2 of us plus tip)Check in was smooth and girl was very pleasant. Our room (1609) was better than expected having read some reviews prior to departure. It was spacious enough for the 2 of us, although bathroom was a tad small although perfectly serviceable! Plenty of towels and 2 robes provided. Only negative was the shower took ages to get the hot water to come through (they did do some repairs one day so may have been fixing it then?)Using the tradesmans' entrance was to become a regular thing...on 3 separate occasions we were advised that we could not use the front entrance as there were events taking place and they obviously did not want us common folk getting in the way! This got a bit annoying after a while!!One night when it was late and raining we returned...wet and minus our umbrella! We were ignored by the doorman so he could run down the road to the aid of what could only be described as a &quot;pretty woman&quot; character! (incidentally already carrying her own umbrella!!!) It was a quite a picture which will not be forgotten quickly...next time I go I must wear at least Prada/Cartier to get any kind of attention and carry my Amex card of course!!Overall we had a great stay tho' . ideal location, comfortable room and we got a good deal via Greenbee!"
330,1969,"Apr 12 2008 	The Wonderful Waldorf....	We stayed at the Hotel to enjoy the history of the Waldorf and it's old world charm. Found the room w/ a Queen bed to be on the small side with an outdated 26' TV set in a large armoire.The staff was very professional and helpful, especially the doormen hailing us a taxi and giving us city tips.Enjoyed dinner at the Bull and Bear restaurant, although overpriced and somewhat darkly lit.You must stay at the Waldorf at least once in this short life.Paul H. - Irvine, CA"
331,1969,"Apr 9 2008 	Old Titanic	I stayed at the Waldorf in March for two nights. I had the opportunity to stay in several high end hotels and I can tell you that I was not impressed. I realized it's NYC and prices are higher but really folks, 20.00 for two eggs any style in the Peacock restaurant for breakfast? Twelve dollars for a bowl of oatmeal (not that we ordered that) Check out the menu on their website, your eyes will roll back in your head. Ok down to the nitty gritty, the room, 17th floor average size and just plain ugly old yellow and brown decor, with a huge armoure that takes up too much room and an old 27 inch regular TV. The beds were terribly uncomfortable, the bedding scratchy white hotel sheets with a 200 lb bed spread that looked like it belonged on one of the beds on the Titanic and flat pillows. The only modern device in the room was the alarm clock that allowed for an Ipod. I could not regulate the heat, it was very hot, the bathroom was really small and there was no exhaust fan. It took 2 minutes before the water came out of the faucet in the tub and then it took at least 8 minutes before any hot water came out. The curtains, again very Titanic and white sheers that looked so dingy I wondered if there had been a fire. The desk is way to small to do any work on. Don't ever book a room that is near the elevator because all you will hear all night is the sound of a 747 taking off down the runway. The website doesn't tell you that there is a Starbucks down stairs. And it does not tell you that it costs 50.00 a day to park your car and an additional 10.00 if you have an SUV. I paid 120.00 bucks for two days OUCH! The lobby is very &quot;grand&quot; and dark, again like an old ship. I will say that when I checked in I found the staff to be very friendly, including the bellmen, the doorman and any man or woman that worked there. Here's a cool fact that the man who checked me in told me when I had advised him that my father stayed there in 1950 for his honeymoon, he asked if he still had that bill? Then went on to tell me if he still had the bill and wanted to stay there, that the Waldorf would honor that price he paid in 1950. If you are going to have to stay in a hotel, don't you want to have the same amenities or even better amenties that you do at home? I suppose if you are a history buff, you might love it"
332,1969,"Apr 6 2008 	Earplugs are provided!	My wife and I came to the Waldorf Astoria to attend a meeting of my old alma mater. We were given a room by the elevators which was not properly insulated for noise. Cars going up and down all night made it difficult for us to sleep. When we reported the incident, we were offered ear plugs!The following day, when we insisted that we would like to have a good night sleep, one of the managers, Mark, who had offered the plugs in the first place, suggested that we move to another room, but at twice the price! When we expressed dissatisfaction with this option, we were promised an alternative room, which would be ready in a matter of minutes. We left a cell phone number where we would be called. Five hours later, we had not been contacted. Before attending a show at the Waldorf Towers, we complained to Vivian, a kind person at the reception, who spoke to another manager, reassuring us that there would be a room available but that it would take a couple of hours to be cleaned. When we returned two hours later, as requested, we were asked to talk with yet another manager, Elena Oxford. She informed us, as kindly as she could, that there were no rooms available at that time. It was 11:00 PM then. We asked to be moved to another hotel. We were offered The San Carlos, a few blocks away. After several new phone interactions with Elena, who was always very professional and polite, we were shown yet another room at the Waldorf Astoria, but that now had constant noise from the street!By midnight, when we were ready to change hotels, we were offered another room, on a higher floor, and far from the elevators. At long last, we could get some quiet time. This was a perfect example of a lesson I received from one of my old tutors at university: when a place has a good reputation, I does not deserve it anymore!"
333,1969,"Apr 5 2008 	Elegance and Service with a great location!	My husband took me to New York City to celebrate my 40th birthday. We spent two nights in the Waldorf-Astoria. This hotel embodies old word elegance and charm. I felt like I was in the middle of an old Hollywood movie from the moment I walked into the impressive lobby. This sprawling hotel is also quite luxurious with plush carpets and swag draperies. A bellman greeted our cab as we pulled up to the hotel and our luggage was whisked away by very efficient porters. At check in, we learned that our room probably wouldn't be ready until about 3:00 p.m. The front desk clerk took my husband's cell phone number and said that he would give us a personal call when our room was ready. After receiving the call that our room was ready, we took a ride in the elevator to the 15th floor where our room was located. I must admit, after reading some of the trip reviews posted here, I was a little nervous and scared that I would find mold in the bathroom, peeling wallpaper, or dirty furniture. Thank goodness I did not find any of these things. Instead, we walked down a private corridor to our room and were greeted with a very elegant and clean bedroom. The main room had a King sized bed, a plush chair, a desk and chair, nightstands and an armoire with a large flat screen T.V. on top. Off of the bedroom was a dressing room with another plush chair, a small table, two mirrored his and her wardrobe closets, and a vanity area with stool. The bathroom had French doors and was done in black and tan. There were lots of nice details such as silver waste baskets, a silver tissue holder, complimentary magazines relevant to the NYC area, and plush robes. The molding and light fixtures were very pretty and added character to the room.Shortly after settling into our room there was knock on the door. Because it was my birthday, the hotel sent up a birthday card and a silver tray complete with fresh fruit, a small loaf cake, and a large bottle of Spring water. It was services like this that made our stay so unforgettable.We ate in Peacock Alley and Oscar's while we were there. I ordered a steak in the Peacock Alley and was disappointed to find that it was full of fat and quite tough. The service in the restaurant was top notch and the waiter quickly noticed my distress. The manager came over and said that we would not be charged for my entree and would I like the chef to grill me another steak? They also provided my husband and I with complimentary flutes of champagne in honor of my birthday. My husband was very pleased with his meal and gave it a thumb's up. Since the service was so wonderful, the unfortunate steak incident was quickly forgotten.We had breakfast both mornings in Oscars. They offer a decent breakfast buffet which was complimentary to us since my husband in a Hilton Diamond member.The location of this hotel is very nice. Walk two blocks and you are right at Saks Fifth Avenue and across the street from Rockefeller Center. You are within walking distance of Central Park, great shopping on and off Fifth Avenue (including Bloomingdales), and Times Square. Cab service was very easy to catch from the front of the hotel. The hotel assists guests with finding a cab. The bellman always opened the door when the cab pulled back up to the hotel which gives you a nice &quot;welcome home&quot; feeling.One thing I did find strange was that the conditioner, soaps, and moisturizer were all from the same English brand but the shampoo was Neutrogena. They did not refill the soaps or shampoo between cleanings of the room.We did enjoy the turn down service each night because they also pulled down all the window shades and closed the curtains. We did not find the room to be too noisy considering that we were staying in such a central section of the city."
334,1969,"Apr 5 2008 	Famous hotel but a little dated	The Waldorf does live up to its reputation, although in parts, it is becoming rather dated.The staff were the friendliest and most helpful I have met in a hotel to date. The lobby area is very exclusive, and shows why the Waldorf has the reputation it has. The room was very good, and the decor reflected the upmarket nature of the hotel, however, the bathroom was dated, and the carpet was showing signs of wear. The shower head also looked cheap and It would not stay up on its own.The elevators/lifts also took a long time to arrive at the floor (though they arrive quickly in the lobby). On one occasion, we waited 10 minutes, then decided to take the stairs instead from the 9th floor."
335,1969,"Apr 3 2008 	Great stay at the Waldorf	We wanted a hotel for a seven-day New York experience and chose the Waldorf for its name,and despite seeing some indifferent reviews on this site.We need not have worried; the stay was great. The service from the hotel was absolutely first class, and the rooms (on the cheapest tariff) were spacious and well maintained.We even stayed for breakfast every day- something we had not planned to do- as we found the buffet so good.Another bonus was the ease with which we could access city attractions, as we were easily within walking distance of Times Square, Broadway, MOMA and Cental Park.A super holiday at a super hotel!"
336,1969,Apr 3 2008 	Fabulous Waldorf	We stayed here for 3 nights over the last weekend in March and had a fantastic time. The photographs do not do justice to the real thing. It is old fashioned but absolutley fabulous. The service is second to none and the best my sister has experienced and she has stayed in other hotels in New York over a dozen times over the years. We paid a bit extra for a superior room but got a good discount. The room was very large with 2 king size beds and a walk in wardrobe and beautiful marble bathroom. You will be bowled over by the architecture and stunning flower displays. The rooms do not have tea and coffe making facilites but there is a Starbucks in the main entrance that we used.A good tip if you havent been to NYC before is to take advice from the concierge with regard to restaurants as some look decidely ropey from the outside but fantastic when you get in. We had great meals in Little Italy and China Town. We also booked Empire State building on the internet and got a far better deal than if we paid on the day (plus you can jump the queue) We went to BB Kings for brunch on Sunday with the Harlem Gospel singers and had a great time. This was also booked online as all the shows at BB Kings were sold out for the 4 days we were there. The pace in New York is frantic and all the people we met were friendly and helpful without exception. The key is to plan what you want to do but be flexible according to the weather. Tickets you buy online are not date and time specified which allows you to make the most of good weather and shop when bad weather! Best times to visit attractions seem to be early before 9am or after 6pm. We visited Top of the Rock at 11pm and it was deserted - fantastic!
337,1969,"Apr 2 2008 	Loved The W=A!!!	My husband and I went to New York last month for the very first time. We booked our trip on Expedia and were so excited to stay at the Waldorf since it's such a landmark hotel. After reading some mixed reviews on tripadvisor, I emailed the concierge to ask if my husband and I could be upgraded to a recently renovated room during our stay. I got a prompt email from the head of guest services indicating that he put our request through. We were not disappointed when we checked into our room. Our room was lovely, w/a flat screen t.v., king sized bed, 2 windows (one facing Park Ave.), nice black &amp; white tiled marble and new fixtures, etc. But the room was just the beginning of our wonderful stay there. From the moment we checked in to the moment we left, the service from everyone from the reception, bell desk, doormen, maids, to every other W=A staff person we encountered was impeccable. Which was very impressive considering that we are in no way people of elite status or means. Everyone is (I hope) treated with equal amount of respect and quality service. Wonderful experience."
338,1969,Apr 2 2008	Beautiful	We stayed here as I love the film Coming to America and it's where the king stayed!! I did not expect great things as the reviews weren' t great. I was pleasantly surprised as we were upgraded to a suite with a dressing room living room and kitchen. Room service was expensive but well presented. Try the sunday morning brunch it's to die for. Great Location good for a treat.
339,1969,"Apr 2 2008	Nice but overpriced.	I didn't think the rooms were anything special. Classic old money New York. There are a lot of more exciting places to stay.I ate dinner at the steakhouse and my steak was poorly cooked and lacking flavorWith all of that said, the history of the hotel is amazing and everyone should stay at the Waldorf at least once in their lifetime"
340,1969,"Apr 2 2008 	At the Waldorf.... March 24-26	I really wanted to love the Waldorf. I had set my expectations accordingly i.e. low, changed in a few large bills for smaller bills to tip everyone we came across and I had even made sure not to wear blue jeans at the Waldorf=Astoria so I could take in the historic hotel and feel one with my environment.Unfortunately after the front desk, service pretty much went down hill. I remember Lauren checked us in and she was quite nice giving us the option of two rooms to choose from and even supplied us with a map of NYC, complimentary water and a verbal overview of the hotels restaurants. The room (1727) was nice enough, pretty clean and I could find almost no fault with the room, loads of hot water, working quiet heater, no inside or outside noise. The lotion that the staff leaves from FRESH is top-notch.Unfortunately at the Waldorf apparently the doormen are too busy doing other things (standing around looking Waldorf=Astoriaish) to hold open doors.At the Waldorf bell hops are too busy (talking about other guests broken luggage) to take your bags and just leave you standing around feeling foolish in front of the hellhop desk.At the Waldorf cleaning staff never fully make your bed, but instead leave the bedspread and shams folded in the room on the luggage rack for your entire two night stay. At the Waldorf's Bull and Bear Restaurant where one soda, one drink and dessert run $50 the staff is far too busy to provide your table with a table cloth or service of any kind.At the Waldorf you will be left to fight off black town cars sent over by the staff to take you to the airport. The WA even has a sign inside suggesting you only take yellow checker cabs, so why an employee would send a black town car over to it's guests is beyond me.If you want to stay here, you are going to do it no matter what you read. It's not horrible, but I just say make sure you know why you want to stay here and that it's not because you think you're going to have some super four star treatment by the staff of the Waldorf=Astoria."
341,1969,"Mar 31 2008 	Great stay in great city	Although the hotel itself is old, the room we had was recently remodeled &amp; better than expected. Flat screen tv, updated bathroom, and larger than most NY rooms. Friends stayed on another floor and their room decor was older, not recently updated, yet larger than our room, no flat screen tv, but a huge dressing room and large marble bathroom. The hotel staff was friendly, turndown service was great as was doormen &amp; bell desk. The hotel sundry store is lacking, but there's other DR drugstores nearby or street corner vendors for a cheaper drink/snack. The lobby is beautifully decorated. Location is great for shopping in midtown, 5th Ave, walking to Time Square, theatre district, and MoMa. I will stay here again. Room Service &amp; restaurants are expensive, but exptected in this area &amp; this hotel. Quality is good."
342,1969,"Mar 31 2008 	Wonderful Experience	My wife and i have stayed here twice. Each time was truly a great experience. The staff was friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable . Room was superb, food was top notch, and ambience was unbeatable. We have booked 5 more stays here for next winter."
343,1969,"Mar 31 2008 	Perfect New York Hotel	After being surprised for with a Christmas present of a fully booked trip to New York, I was straight onto tripadvisor to check out the Waldorf but slightly worried after reading the reviews. When I arrived at the hotel everything from the bell boy taking our luggage, to the amazing lobby, right up to our huge room, they all far exceeded my expectations. The Waldorf Astoria a hotel of movies. Old World New York has been sadly mistaken in previous reivews for shabby and it is far from this. IT IS OLD WORLD, the New York style that Sinatra and co would have known. They have kept the hotel true to its original style. The amazing main foyer is something to experience, treat yourself to cocktails accompaniend by free nibbles of olives or fancied up bread sticks and music by the house piano player. Admire the supersized flower display like none I have ever seen before and people watch, see the real new yorker have meetings here.Our room was amazing, we paid for the grade above standard and were amazed at the sheer size of the room. There was a massive super king bed, 2 walk in wardrobes. THe bed was incredably comfortable and there was a turndown service every evening. We got engaged while we were there and the hotel were aware of this, we arrived back that evening to find a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a card from the hotel. The hotel is in a great location, you are in walking distance of lots of major attractions and some bus tours stop right outside the hotel.Definately would go back."
344,1969,"Mar 28 2008	Shocking Hotel. Good Stay.	I stayed in a quadruple room (two double beds) on the 9th floor of the Waldorf for 6 nights in March. Check in was fast and courteous. The Receptionist wasn't overly friendly or interested in us but that suited us quite well as we just wanted to get to our room. We'd had a long and bumpy flight and been terrorised by the rudest little man I've ever met at immigration in JFK.Anyway. The room was a good size, very clean and comfortable. I had been worried by previous reviews mentioning the shabby decor but although it did look a little tired and dated in places the wonderful comfortable beds, walk in closet and fluffy towels made up for that. The bathroom was also slightly dated but the shower was great and the toiletries were replenished daily. There was a good hairdryer in the room and an iron with ironing board. The only things missing were tea and coffee making facilities. I know Americans don't drink much tea but this was an international hotel and I go a bit mad without my tea.The staff were helpful and polite and I did feel a little bit special despite it being such a large hotel. This was very welcome because outside of the hotel almost all the New Yorkers I met were very rude - something I found gobsmacking in a city where the world and his wife wants a tip for their &quot;good&quot; service.I only had two real problems with the hotel. Firstly, the lighting in the bathroom was somehow rigged to make you look like you'd been dead 4 weeks - or feel like you wish you'd been dead 4 weeks. I've never felt so ugly! Secondly, the entire hotel gives out electric shocks constantly and is filled with the sight of people leaping back from light switches and elevator doors. It did make us laugh at first but when you've had your 9th shock of the day and start debating with your friends who is going to draw the short straw and have to touch a door nob then it gets a little bit irritating. However, these are minor points and if you can get a good price via the internet then I recommend the Waldorf because of it's location, cleanliness and peace (the lobby is often very busy but once upstairs in our room we never heard a sound from another room or from outside). I wouldn't pay the full prices asked for if you book directly.We didn't eat in any of the restaurants as we'd heard they were expensive but did enjoy some ultra strong but wonderful cocktails in the lobby one afternoon. You can sit and guzzle them while listening to piano music and watching the world walk by - very nice.I liked this hotel and loved the bed which I could have lived in quite happily!"
345,1969,"Mar 27 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed for 5 nights in a great corner room with twin beds (3 persons) No heating in bathroom, but otherwise very good. Very good service all over hotel, but also very expensive bars and restaurants. Eat outside for breakfast : &quot;Burger Heaven&quot; on 49th, and great thin Italian pizza at &quot;Angelos&quot; 2 av., or at &quot;Dockers&quot; in the neigbourhood.The atmosphere is worth everything at this great hotel."
1,1984,Nov 16 2009 	Excellent hotel	Great hotel. Really new and clean. Great location for all tourist sights in NYC. Free breakfast was a great bonus. Fitness room looked really nice (although didn't use it). Loads of TV channels. Really comfy bed. Would definitely stay again.
2,1984,"Nov 12 2009 	Location location location	Our room was a king &quot;suite&quot;, the smallest room type at this property. We were at the back of the hotel, a real plus for us, since this hotel is on a busy cross town street, with lots of traffic noise. Because this is a Hilton Grand Vacation Club, it had a coffee maker and a mini refrigerator, (but no microwave). This property only opened in July, everything is brand spanking new, as a result. There is an owner's lounge here for breakfast and snacks, but no in house restaurant or room service. There is a concierge, and we found her quite helpful. The lobby area is attractive, with lots of hotel personnel, but pretty small. The location could not be more central for Manhattan. Both buses and multiple subway lines are right outside the hotel. We walked to a couple of nearby museums, the Museum of Art &amp; Design, and the Museum of American Folk Art. Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center were only a few minutes walk away, as was Central Park."
3,1984,"Oct 12 2009 	Great location and wonderful amenities!	Loved the location - right in the center of it all! Of course if you're only looking to do Broadway, there are closer hotels, but this one was perfect to check out Central Park, visit Times Square, catch &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, etc. The room I stayed in was a bit cramped, albeit typical for a NYC high rise hotel - I know a few of my colleagues got upgraded rooms that were a bit bigger. In room stuff (TV, desk, bathroom amenities) were dated, but I understand that the hotel is undergoing a huge renovation project to upgrade everything. Highly recommend this hotel for the location alone!"
4,1984,"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent location wonderful staff wonderful room!	If you have an opportunity to stay at the West 57th Street by Hilton Club, you should! This is not a typical hotel as it is part of the HIlton Vacation Ownership portfolio. So if you are staying in it as a &quot;hotel&quot;, then you are considered a &quot;renter&quot;. If you find a rate that you can live with at this property (remember it's NYC), book it!I have only great things to say about this property. The location is wonderful (next to Carnegie Hall, just 1 block from Central Park, ideal shopping just blocks away, nearby restaurants, etc.)! The staff was extremely professional and accommodating - a very pleasant team to work with. They do have an lounge for owners where they have continental breakfast (upgraded continental) and evening hors d'oeuvres, but if they allow you access to it, be sure to use it as it is worth it!The rooms are fantastic and I think quite roomy for NYC standards. I stayed in a studio unit and loved it. They offered both an empty fridge and a mini-bar. They have included many technological enhancements to the rooms so they can be a bit overwhelming with all of the instruction cards they provide. But a quick tutorial by one of their staff (who admits he does these tutorials several times each week), will have you maneuvering through it all quickly.Overall a great experiece! I would definitely stay there again if I get the chance!"
5,1984,"Oct 8 2009 	Great location still working out the kinks	We purchased a timeshare at this hotel more than a year before it was completed, and had been looking forward to staying here for months. We decided on a studio unit for our first stay--didn't want to get spoiled by having to later &quot;trade down&quot; from a larger unit. The studio was beautiful, large (for a NYC hotel room!), with ample amenities. What we didn't like was the bathroom design--the glass shower stall is completely open to the bedroom, and although there's a sliding opaque door that mostly covers it, there's still a 6-inch clear glass gap even when it's fully closed, so someone in the shower can see into the bedroom--and vice versa! This wasn't a problem for us, but I don't think I'd be as comfortable staying in this unit with anyone other than my husband....Overall, service was good, and we loved the continental breakfast (more upscale than most) and happy hour snacks &amp; drinks in the owners' lounge. But the lounge got quite crowded at peak hours (particularly between 8:30 and 9:30 am); it really needs to be larger. We didn't use the fitness room, but it was quite impressive, and I'll definitely try it on my next stay. We called about several problems (no hot water one morning and a light bulb making an annoying humming noise in our bathroom) which weren't addressed before we checked out. I was disappointed that the spa wasn't open yet--am also looking forward to trying that on our next trip..."
6,1984,"Sep 23 2009	try this again	My family has returned from a five day stay at the new HGVC West 57th street in New York. I wanted to give you a few of our observations and suggestions.A. People B. Building C. Location D. SuggestionsA. Certainly having good people on site is very important. Our experience was very good. The staff was willing to help in every area where we had a challenge. As DCBob previously reviewed, the Television system is complicated and challenging. The Hilton staff came to our room several times to get the set up explained to us. This includes day and night request. The doorman was quick to recruit us a taxi and to give walking directions. When the computer was removed from the Owners Lounge (now relocated to the welcome area) the desk was willing to let me use the machines downstairs to check emails. B. The building is very much our taste, modern and contemporary. The artist drawings are VERY much what it actually looks like. There are just two guest elevators and they stay busy and move slow. Even thought the lifts are small, my compliments on having floor buttons on each side of the door. The exercise room has a glass window over the street on the 2nd floor. My wife used a treadmill each morning; this area is a 10. It is a super view. Journey to the 25 floor to enjoy the outside terrace (see photos). My family sat up there an hour one night, with a cold beverage, to enjoy the night lights! It is an even better view than the exercise room. Please note that not all the guest rooms face the north (57th). On our floor only 803,804, 805, 806 and 807 had the premium view. Hey, I did not travel to the city to look out the window so our poor view was not a problem for me. A photo of our view is attached. A guest ice machine would be great even if on a few floors. I do not mind calling guest services for ice or even giving a tip, its the waiting that is a thorn. The large bathtub has no horizontal place to set your soap, shampoo, or wine. Perhaps a wire type basket could be attached. Our room refrigerator did not get very cold, only cool. We did call and have maintenance check it but it was below standard. C. Super location. One subway entrance is 30 yards and another is at the other end of the block giving us access to several lines. Please note that there is a large pharmacy next door with everything from Q-tips to beer so doesnt worry about forgetting anything. We walked to Top of the Rock, a Broadway play, Central Park and Time Square with ease. Local restaurants will keep you happy Rue 57 has sidewalk seating which is fun. We walked to Le Cirque and to Ruth Chris, both very good and expensive. My favorite meal was at the Brooklyn Diner just a block west on 57th. The burger was $17 but very satisfying. The club had umbrellas for guest use no need to bring one. This is a location HGVC owners will enjoy as a home base for NYC fun. I did overhear a few people complaining about parking but I do not know the details. D. Better television set-up Ice Machines Bath tub basket Accessible computer to check emails Outside sidewalk cover for rainy days It would be helpful to have a mirror in the living are of the 1BDENJOY, we did!"
7,1984,"Sep 18 2009 	Falls short in too many ways	Arrived on Sept. 16, for 2 nights, a studio room. The room was average size for NYC, nicely decorated with hardwood floors, marble shower (no tub) and high end toiletries. Flat screen TV with residential style cable box with a plethora of channels, including HBO, nice owner's lounge that servce an excellent continental breakfast. So far, so good. Here are the drawbacks: VERY slow internet access in the room (both wired and wireless - it took almost an hour to download a video that at home would have taken 3 minutes - I am a Honors Diamond member, so I have some perspective on the internet standards at other Hilton sites, and this one is just not up to par); no turndown service, even upon request (even the Doubletree Times Sq. has turndown upon request); poor lighting in the bathroom; during breakfast, there is very loud new age music playing (so loud that I could not have a conversation on my cell phone - I mentioned it to a manager, who fixed it, but the next morning it was back to high volume); nice to have a ton of TV channels but no channel guide (either on screen or printed), so with so many channels it can be frustratingly slow to find a specific network (for example, MSNBC, CNN and FOX News are not lumped together); it would be nice to have on demand movies available; the front desk is staffed with many newbies who all seem very nice and eager to please, but they (and even their managers) do not have the knowledge or experience that I've seen at other Hilton properties. For example, the front desk clerk at a brand new Hilton Garden Inn in Long Island knew more about the details of the fitness center hours than did the front desk clerk at W57th. When I asked about the availability of turndown service, it was clear that the clerk had no idea what that term means. I really wanted to like this hotel, but for now I will go back to staying at the Hilton Club at TheHilton,"
8,1984,"Sep 15 2009 	Excellent Service- Extremely Helpful!	I travel to NYC frequently on business. I always stay in a high-end hotel close to the park, and naturally, decided to give West 57th Street a try. I was extremely pleased with the level of service- which rivaled some of my favorites- the Parker Meridien and the Pierre. The Concierge was extremely helpful. I needed car service at 11:00 pm, which they were able to coordinate for me on demand at the last minute. They also arranged for me to see Billy Elliott on Sunday afternoon by getting me 2 tickets at a great price! The rooms are also very clean and spacious- especially for NYC. I am looking forward to my next stay."
9,1984,"Sep 13 2009 	Not up to HGVC service standards	I just returned from a three night stay in a one bedroom &quot;premium&quot; suite. Although the suite was nice - three rooms - living room, bedroom, bathroom - and it was huge by NYC standards, the service was really not good at all.We have beeen HGVC owners for nine years. We have stayed mostly in Las Vegas and Orlando and our experiences have been perfect. Big, nicely equipped properties with lots of amenities and staffs who knew the property, the surrounding area and the nearby attractions. This staff was almost clueless. There was one guy, Jeff, who was very helpful interms of directions and the very talented Ovie at the door was charming and really good at his job. Beyond them, though, nothing. My perception, based on the website and advertising, was that the room would have a view of Central Park. Not even close. I had a view of the people working in the buildings across the street. I called the desk when I got to the room to see if I could get a better view since I was paying many extra points to be in a one BR PREMUIM room. The woman said, no dice. All the rooms are the same and none of them overlook the park, Not at all the impression you get from the website.My minibar had no price menu so I called the front desk to ask the price of a bottle of wine. The guy said, &quot;The price list is in the minibar.&quot; I said, &quot;No it;s not.&quot; He said, &quot;Well it should be.&quot; (Is that helpful??) I asked him if he could tell me the price of the wine and he said he'd call me back. He never did.I complained about these two things to a manager the morning of my checkout and he said, &quot;Yeah that's why I'm here for two weeks.&quot; But he never asked for specifics or my name or anything. That was not good. I was trying to provide him with some constructive feedback and he blew me off.Now, the room itself was nice. The breakfast buffets and cocktail parties were nice but wicked crowded. It rained the whole time I was there so the pation seating was unusable but I was unable to sit down half of the time I was in the place. That was unpleasant.Great location but bad service. I'd be careful with this place until they figure things out."
10,1984,"Sep 10 2009 	Wonderful wonderful wonderful	What a great place. Had a studio w/ a king bed which was nicer than any hotel I've stayed at in New York (all 4*s). Everything was new and clean which helped tremendously. Location is 2 blocks from Central Park, same block as Carnegie Hall. The workout room and owners lounge were very attractive. Staff was very friendly and helpful.Would stay again in a heart beat!"
11,1984,"Sep 9 2009 	Hilton Honors Members - STAY AWAY!!!	I've been an honors member for years and the only reason I stayed at this hotel was to take advantage of the triple honors point offer. I'd read the review below about the woman at the front desk messing up his points reward. Well, the people at the front desk said I was all set when I checked out. Now three calls to Hilton Honors later I have to wait 7-10 days for them to process my claim - and god forbid you lost your receipt (I didn't). So either the front desk people screwed up or the Hitlon people screwed up - I tend to think the former since this hasn't happened to me before. I could complain about the rude way I was treated by the Honors people on the phone, but that's another issue. The valet also took 45 minutes to bring up my car for an important business meeting on Long Island. Basically a disaster for Honors members - nice brand new rooms but that's about it."
12,1984,"Sep 1 2009 	Luxury made to feel like home!	I went to NY for the first time and since I was alone the staff was wonderful to help me do all the little things like teaching me how to hail a taxi to making reservations at places a solo traveler would feel comfortable. All the staff learned my name on the first day and always went out of their way to welcome me. It was nice to always know who you were going to talk to when a question arose. There was a delay at check-in but it was worth the wait! The room was incredible with views of both the Upper East and West Sides and all of Central Park. I had a Suite that was smaller than most 1-Bedroom Suites in the HGVC resorts but it was plenty big for 1 or 2 people. It had a large couch and a uniquely nice Bose system for a hotel room. The bathroom was the most amazing part since you could take a bath and look out floor to ceiling windows of the city. (As long as your discreet of course!) They have room service that is fast and serves huge portions. One order of bacon lasted me for 3 days. But beware of the mini-bar. I opened it and started picking up several items looking at them but did not take any. At the end of my stay I was charged for all of them and they said that the refrigerator has a weight sensor so when you pick up a item it automatically charges your room. The owners lounge was a nice place to grab a cup of coffee in the middle of the day when I needed a break from the city. However, around cocktail hour it becomes too crowded for my comfort. I'm not sure if you are allowed to go in there if your not an owner though. They had someone outside the door checking off who came in so don't be surprised if you get turned down. I never had breakfast in there so I can't comment on that. The internet worked perfectly and had no complaints overall. It was sort of weird staying at a HGVC resort where you did not have to take out your own garbage and do your dishes. They will come in and empty the trash daily for you upon request only, however like all HGVC resorts they only do cleaning once for a 7 night stay. For me that is to be expected but for others who are checking in here as a hotel instead of timeshare then you need to realize you won't get fresh towels and made beds unless you ask for them. But then again perhaps they treat the hotel guests differently. I don't know. Regardless I loved my week there and did not want to come home."
13,1984,"Aug 29 2009 	Great new hotel near park	Full of modern decor and accents and a bit of a studio apartment instead of hotel room feel, this property is a comfortable and warm home base for New York business or leisure travel.The rooms are large and well appointed with a soft bed, large bathroom, and comfortable desk area.Television comes from a direct cable feed and not On Command/Lodgenet, so it has a great variety of channels.Room is very well lit and large for similarly priced accommodations. Most rooms don't have a park view though.The lobby is a bit small and feels much more like an apartment entry area than a full-service hotel.Overall, a great value for the location and size of the room."
14,1984,"Aug 26 2009 	mixed feelings	First of all I praise the newly built room with all my heart. The most important things I look for from a hotel in a business trip is utmost clean(preferably new construction) room and bathroom, quietness at night, fast internet access and well-dried high quality sheets. I hate all the NYC hotels in that sense. Even the nicer ones are not so shiny and need renovations (simply because they're old hotels). Of course 3-3.5 star ones with popular names such as Hilton, Sheraton etc. are mostly tired, exhausted, and guests are treated nothing but as tourists.This hotel fits the bill and I'd probably go back for that reason whenever I go to NYC.However, the hotel may be too young. That is, the management is a bit off. Even though I paid the full fare, I was not given the room with view. My room was on the back side of the building looking at another office building. I might have requested another room with view if I was a tourist but for this particular trip, I didn't care, so I stayed in the room. But I still don't get why they put me in the room in the beginning. Another rare incident was that my check-in was delayed so I had to hang out for an hour. I finally got in the room after 4pm, the wireless didn't work in the hotel unlike they are advertised. I asked for a Lan cable it took an hour and half and four phone calls to receive it. I needed to search the web for some location I needed to go before I left the room but I had to be stuck there for an hour and half and was late for something, which was pretty annoying. If you don't carry cables as all the normal people don't, ask for one before going up to the room or at least check if the wireless works (although I remember when I check in, the receptionist swore the wireless would work fine).After this hiccup on the first day, everything went fine. The breakfast was nothing special (it may be a little too light?) but it helped to have one offered by the hotel.The check-out procedure again let me think that they're not so well-trained staffs. It seemed that no one could answer very simple questions right away. I had to pay some kind of tax I wasn't aware of but didn't have energy to ask. I still haven't received the Hilton honor's point after a month. It seems that they probably don't give points but nothing indicated so when I reserved through the Hilton honor's page. I guess I shouldn't expect too much from these guys. This hotel's mgt is less like the one of a hotel but more like one of rental apartments. I'd go back to this hotel keeping that in mind (then there's nothing too much to complain.)"
15,1984,"Aug 14 2009 	Beautiful property service uneven; very good/and not so hot	For a very detailed, accurate review of this property the first review dated July 5 does the hotel justice, with the exception of the last paragraph about the amazing happy hour including fine cuts of meat etc. We checked into two rooms last night, August 13, with high expectations. On the Hilton website the hotel is beautiful and new. The location between Central Park and Midtown is close to the action without the hordes of tourists.I should point out I am a Hilton Gold member and travel extensively for work and play. When we checked in, we inquired about the happy hour that the previous reviewer had disclosed. The young lady who was checking us in replied quite haughtily; &quot; that is for the &quot;owners&quot; of the hotel; not people checking in for a night.&quot; Not a good start.We then gave her our tax exempt forms and went up to our admittedly beautiful rooms.The next morning our bills under the door did not have the taxes removed. A quick stop at the front desk before breakfast from a wonderful young lady quickly took care of that problem.When we checked out, I noticed that my Hilton number was not on the receipt. The same young lady advised that since this is a vacation club property Hilton members do not get points. When I returned home tonight, I checked the Hilton website. The happy hour is not listed on the website, but there is no mention that we do not get our points.I telephoned Hilton customer service and they stated the clerk was wrong and we will be awarded Hilton points in two to five days. We shall see.I do want to point out that except for the young lady with the attitude who checked us in; everyone else went out of their way to be friendly and courteous. There was also plenty of staff on hand to attend to everyone's needs.The fitness room (not mentioned in the previous posts) is adequate with the standard Hilton Precor Fitness equipment and free weights.I would stay at this property again for it's amenities and location if they can work out the service bugs.Cheers.Marius"
16,1984,"Jul 5 2009 	Enjoyed my stay at this beautiful luxury timeshare property	The location of this property is in the heart of midtown Manhattan and it's on the same block as Carnegie Hall. You couldn't find a more convenient location to both Central Park and the Theater District.I checked in the morning of Friday, July 3, which was opening day. The check-in experience was very quick with so many staff members working that day. The staff were all friendly and tried their best to accommodate any reasonable request. I requested and received a Studio Plus room on a high floor (the 20th - the top floor is the 26th). The elevator was fairly quick up to the 20th floor. Key card access is set up in each of the two elevators but is not working yet.When I opened the door, I smelled the odor of new leather from the stuffed chair in the corner. The next thing you notice is the handsome blonde all-wood floor and an awesome all Italian marble shower stall with a glass wall letting in lots of light from the floor-to-ceiling windows it faces. You can also slide an opaque door to cover the glass wall if you want privacy, but you might prefer not to do that to get the most natural light!The boutique toiletries are from Archive and include Green Tea &amp; Willow soap and shampoo, Rosehips &amp; Lavender body lotion, and Grapefruit and Neroli shower gel.There is a 37-inch LG high-def flat screen TV and a Yamaha surround sound projector plus a separate Pioneer DVD player. Full 800+ channel digital cable TV is provided through the Time Warner Cable system. The array of available channels is nearly unlimited. The only downside is mastering the use of three separate remote control devices. There is also free high-speed internet in the room using wired Ethernet access. Wi-fi access should also be available soon.The bed is comfortable albeit a bit firm for my personal taste. There are three designer lamps in the room, a 2-cup coffee maker, a mini-bar, and a separate refrigerator that you can fill with your own items.You will find a beautiful Owners Lounge on the second floor across from the fitness center. I won't comment on the fitness center because I did not use it. The lounge features ample seating both inside and on an adjacent outside terrace. There is no kitchen, so all food is catered by the nearby Redeye Grill. Continental breakfast is served from 6:30 AM - 10:00 AM seven days a week. They have fresh fruit, Greek-style strained yogurt with fruit or honey, bagels, croissants, pastries, cereal, cookies, cheese and crackers, bread, orange and grapefruit juice in addition to milk and various bottled water, juices, and drinks, coffee and tea, etc.Evening cocktail hour runs from 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM seven days a week. In addition to soft drinks, red and white wine, canned and bottled beers, and spirits, there are the usual cheeses and fresh fruit plus several hot tapas served from Redeye Grill, including Kobe beef pigs in a blanket, shrimp dumplings, mini quiches, meatballs in marinara sauce, and spring rolls. The food is delicious and a several cuts above the Hilton Club New York, probably because of the caterer used. The spirits are all top shelf (for example, Ketel One vodka and Tanqueray gin).I truly have enjoyed my experience here and highly recommend it to others."

18,1984,Aug 8 2009 	Fabuleux...!
1,1991,Very Trendy Hotel!!!!!	We stayed here last week for 4 nights and had a great time!! We had a &quot;wonderful king&quot; on the 21st floor which was very trendy and pretty spacious with an amazing comfy bed!!!!! Location is fantastic Its bang in the middle of Times Square!!! The staff were really helpful and friendly too!!
2,1991,Wonderful	We spent 5 nights at the W this week for our honeymoon and my hubbys 40Th birthday. We requested a room overlooking the Macys Thanksgiving day parade and we got one room 2904. We arrived a little early for check in and they gave us vouchers for free drinks at the bar while we waited. The room was a great size with plenty of room and storage and a great flat screen tv. The staff we great and very friendly. Hotel was right on Time Square but wasnt noisy at all at night
3,1991,"My family and I had such a great stay at this trendy hotel--we felt like celebrities!	My family and I stayed at the W Times Square in July. The location is perfect--right in the hustle and bustle of Times Sq but located on a fairly quiet street near cute restaurants and delis. The doormen are so friendly! We loved walking through the waterfall-adorned ground entrance. Once you enter the lobby, you feel like you're in a trendy club, but it's definitely not pretentious. All the staff were very nice and accommodating. Whenever we had a request, they responded right away. The rooms were decently sized (this is New York City), and quite chic. The views were amazing. We had a delicious dinner in Blue Fin (the restaurant located downstairs). MAKE SURE you save room for the warm cookie plate! They're the best (so is the seafood). The concierge were also very knowledgable and patient with our lack of NYC knowledge and we could have spent loads of money in the W store. Finally, you can't beat the Bliss bath products and the glass-enclosed showers!"
4,1991,"Nov 25 2009 	Fantabulous hip hotel right in the centre of things	Stayed here last week and can't speak highly enough of teh place.Got a great deal via Hotwire (&lt;$200) which really helped.That said, the entrance hall under a glass ceiling with water tumbling onto it was very cool, the lobby on the 7th floor was very hip, with a great bar (expensive, but very generous pours), free wifi, a great shop and heaps of attentive and very helpful staff.We stayed on the 24th floor, and the room was great - only possible downside was that you could hear the bustle of the street and honking horns below, but that is one of the joys of Times Sq!Times square had a little too much bustle for me and next time I would probably look to stay further south, perhaps in the meat market, but in truth this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in for the money and location - thoroughly recommended"
5,1991,"Nov 19 2009 	Best Place I've ever stayed	This is the coolest, hippest hotel I've ever stayed at. Wonderful bars and restaurant -- superb cocktails and seafood. The lobby is upstairs --you access it from elevators that open onto the street. The staff is great -- very friendly and courteous. The most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Great amenities -- loved the TVs --and the view. I spent Christmas there last year -- and am going to New York again this Christmas but must spend time with relatives. Wish I could go back!!!"
6,1991,"Nov 18 2009 	LOVED THIS HOTEL	I took my daughter to NYC for her 13th birthday. She had never been to NYC. We had a WONDERFUL experience. This hotel is luxury. My daughter felt like a &quot;movie star&quot;. The staff here is unbelieveably helpful and friendly. They remembered that it was my daughter's birthday trip and from check-in things were amazing. Special presents in the room for my daugher, a great view of the city, birthday cake and cards!! They answer every question promptly and professionally. I cannot say enough about how wonderful our experience was and how great the staff was. Hotel is quiet and a GREAT location. Walked to WIcked, basically walked everywhere!! Felt extremely safe here too."
7,1991,"Nov 14 2009 	Nice hotel if a bit dark	Nice hotel for business stay, great service and amenities. It is, however, a bit dark and trendy, which is not for some people's taste. Also, Times Sq is not the best place to stay in New York."
8,1991,"Nov 13 2009 	Outstanding Hotel	I stayed one night at the W Hotel Times Square. I came in on a Friday and left on Saturday. Positives:-Cool/Trendy Atmosphere-Fairly quick check in-W Bar is nice, good place to hang out for a bit-Rooms are nice (had a king size bed on the 14th floor)-Awesome soft super comfortable bed-Shower head provides the most delicious shower I've ever taken (I really don't know why this shower stood out compared to the many different hotel showers I've had)Much more room than the Hudson hotel (my Sis and her bf stayed there and had that as a big complaing)-The concierge service was exceptional in providing information-In addition concierge helped me out with tying my tux tie.-By far my favorite thing is that everyone who answered the phone when you called from your room or who called to your room from the staff greeted you as an individual. It did not feel like you were just another guest, it actually felt personalized. At the end of the day, once you get up to high end hotels, it's things like these that make a difference (&quot;Sorry to wake you from your dreams Mr. _____, but it's time to wake up, would you like me to call you again in a few minutes to make sure you're awake? - wake up call).Negatives- Ipod dock does not charge iphone/ipod just plays music (forgot my charger so it's really my fault)-My room faced Times Square but was blocked by billboards.-"
9,1991,"Nov 10 2009 	Don't believe the hype.	I was excited about staying at the W before I actually got there. My experience differed, however, from that of those who give it favorable reviews. The hotel entry area and 8th floor lobby are very sleek and trendy but the rest of the hotel -- most notably our guestroom -- was very dark and needed some updating. The paint on the ceiling in the bathroom was peeling away, the furniture looked extremely worn and I found the art and color scheme in the room a little depressing. The room was cramped and offered no good storage space for our clothes and other articles. That resulted in a lot of clutter for the length of our stay. The TV kept switching on its own from whatever we were watching to the annoying hotel channel on which pay per view movies are advertised.I was in NYC for the marathon and had looked forward to soaking in a bath after the race. Unfortunately, the room offered only a shower. Room service was too overpriced (e.g., about $50.00 for a small breakfast, most of which was concealed in fine print delivery fees, service charges and tax) to order anything and the lobby bar was pretty much the same (we paid $33 for two simple drinks). At $75 bucks for our four night stay, we elected not to spring for internet service. At $400+ a night, I think the W could provide WiFi for free. The best part of the W was the bed. It was cozy and comfortable, but that's pretty much it. In a nutshell, I think the W times Square is way overrated. For the money (about $1700 for four nights), we deserved better than what the W delivered."
10,1991,"Nov 8 2009 	Great location great hotel	We stayed 4 nights and really couldn't fault the hotel, staff or rooms. We had a corner room on the 56th floor and the views over Times Square and the Hudson River were amazing day and night. We dined at the Blue Fin restaurant for breakfast each day and it was really good, better than any of the others nearby by a mile. We also had dinner one evening upstairs and it was also very good. The location just cannot be beaten, walking across the road to the theatre was so good and all the tourist bus etc stop very close too, as well as the subway stations and taxis. We will definitely stay here again we we next visit New York."
11,1991,"Nov 8 2009 	Top quality hotel right on Times Square	This is the perfect hotel if you want to be close to the action of Times Square but surrounded by the quality, peaceful luxury of a five star hideaway. Nothing was too much trouble for the concierge from locating hard to find seasoning at a local deli to sourcing a particular vodka a local bottle shop. Beds are huge and very comfortable and the ipod docking station is a great touch."
12,1991,"Nov 5 2009 	SERVICE AT THIS HOTEL WAS THE GREATEST STUNNING ROOMS AND VIEW.	we stayed for 4 nights and 5 days, it is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. the hotel is very up beat, clean, comfortable and the rooms quiet. staff are very willing to do what ever you ask. concierge got us reservations that we could not get on our own. we thouroughly enjoyed every momet at this hotel, it is just a great place to stay. we are seniors and still would not go anywhere else except the w hotel times square. this hotel really takes care of their guests and the bed was so very comfortable! staying at the w hotel made us feel a lot younger than our age, we loved every moment at this hotel.also the blue fin restaurant has an excellent reputation so they are a great match."
13,1991,"Nov 4 2009 	Whenever Whatever as long as you have lotsa WDollars:)	We stayed in the Wonderful suite and it was wonderful and sweet. The hotel is trendy. Loved the decor. Comfy beds. The suite had a separate living room big enough to have 10 of your friends hang out comfortably. The staff was eager to help and not a bit stuffy or snooty. This hotel has a hoping bar. They also have an Acura MDX for guests to use. They tell you that it's is offered to guests in a first come first serve basis. We found out that it was first come first serve to the highest bidder FIRST. They do nickle and dime you in this hotel, but that is to be expected in hotels in NYC much less in the Time Square. It's unfair to rate this hotel poorly on the basis of that. When in NYC, expect to spend, spend spend. Another example is that my husband and I wanted to have our own fridge for water and soda, they charged us $50.00 for the baby fridge. I loved my stay here. But if you decide to stay at the W in Time Square, prepare to part with a lot of your W$$$."
14,1991,Nov 4 2009 	Brilliant hotel	Brilliant hotel. NO complaints at all. We had a fabulous room on the 51st floor. 4 of us staying in one room. We got extra towels and toiletries within 5 minutes of a telephone call to reception. We also got a wine cooler and extra glasses within 5 minutes of checking in.The two concierges who we dealt with were very good and the restaurants were unbeatable. Try Benjamins steakhouse for a great steak and great service. All door staff were extra helpful and even let us use the hotel car &amp; driver to take us to a concert.All in a all a good experience.
15,1991,"Nov 2 2009 	Great Location decor. Poor service	We chose the hotel because of its great location and funky, cool decor. It was my girlfriends first time in New York so I wanted it to be special. Firstly this is a really cool hotel and the lobby area and overall ambience is fantastic. Unfortunately there were a few issues that left us having a less than fantastic experience. I paid extra to be upgraded to a &quot;cool corner&quot; room expecting to have 2 windows, I had also specifically asked for a view of Times Square which I was told by reception at check in I had. Instead we had a &quot;corner&quot; room on a lower floor and hence had 1 window and a view away from Times Square, this left us wondering what we were paying the extra money for? On complaining to reception we were told we couldnt be moved for a day and since we were only there for the weekend we thought it wasnt worth the hassle of moving. We were offered a bottle of wine to appease our pain which were happy to accept since we were heading out for dinner that evening and thought it would be nice to have a couple of glasses in our room. Unfortunately after 24hrs (yes hours) the wine had not arrived. On contacting reception I was told somebody would contact in room dining personally to ensure the wine was sent up within 30minutes... 2 hours later still no wine. I contacted in room dining and they knew nothing of the request so obviously once again reception had forgotten about our order. By this time I was feeling very angry, got changed and physically went down to reception to complain, they seemed pretty disinterested with the issue. Fortunately a girl named Kelly in in-room dining sent a bottle up + some extra's without even knowing what the original problem was. On the whole we loved the hotel and location, would stay here again but would make sure we asked for specific details about our room and location."
16,1991,"Oct 26 2009 	Underwhelmed!	Lobby smelt like an indoor poolChewing gum on wash basin in roomPostage stamp sized towelsOnly 1 bathrobeNo room service between 1 &amp; 5pmNot cheap, but with so many great hotels in NYC why go here"
17,1991,Oct 19 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Great hotel. Beautiful rooms. We went to the Blue Fin restaurant for late night desert and the deserts were fabulous. Hotel lobby turns into a bar/lounge at nights. Ideal for a younger crowd.
18,1991,"Oct 18 2009 	Glad I went back to the W Times Square!	I spent 4 nights at the W Times Square (6/10 - 10/10).I went back just for the view and the great beds, so I was hoping to be lucky again and get a corner room. However no corner rooms were available. I was first put in a room on the 30th floor with basically no interesting view, just the hotel across the street.I did put a request for a room change in, and the staff was most helpful and friendly to try and find a solution. I was then, after the 1st night, moved to the 48th floor, not in a corner room but nevertheless a room with a great view.So: staff = friendly and helpfulRooms: newly redecorated. I love the style, I'm a fan.I must say that in my first room (30th) there were some minor issues, the rooms look new but not 'finished', and my towel had a small hole in it, as did the sheets, nothing major for sure, and I wouldn't complain about it. But it's just not something I'd expect from a 4-star hotel.The room on the 48th floor was impeccable though.Location: perfect!!!!Concierge/doormen: very helpful and not 'snobby' at all :-)Safety: as a female travelling solo, no issues, safe location!I truly enjoyed my stay and will go back for a fourth time if I get the chance!Thank you guys,N, Belgium"
19,1991,Oct 17 2009 	W TIMES SQUARE	Stunning hotel with &quot;Bliss&quot;ful bathrooms!!!! glamourus bar but shame about some of the views. Great Location.
20,1991,"Oct 16 2009 	Perfect Place To Spot Tourists Who Want To Be Fashionistas	I know what I'm getting when I stay at a W hotel - - high design, very busy lounge/lobby, a good-looking client base and service that is more attractive than helpful - so the Times Square W meets my expectations. Don't get me wrong - I like this hotel, but maybe in the way I like Vegas. I can do it for 2-3 nights then I'm worn out. The rooms are small but decorated to feel much bigger. The baths are perfectly fine - but again - very small. Room service is to be avoided and the staff is friendly and pretty...just not that &quot;with-it&quot;. The bar becomes a scene at night and I must say the bartenders are actually quite good. If your in NY on business and need to stay in Times Square you should try the Marriott Marquis or the Westin Times Square. If you are simply in town for a big city weekend...the W Times Square will be perfect."
21,1991,"Oct 14 2009 	beautiful and classy	def a very pretty and livable hotel; state of the art rooms; nice lobby; great location; lots of food nearby; public transportation and taxis accessible. we were here for our friends 40th birthday, had a wonderful time; no one bothers you unless you want to be bothered. i would highly recommend you staying here for leisure and business. very modern and up to date; very sheek"
22,1991,Oct 14 2009 	excellant stay	Was worried after reading some of the previous reviews- especially about the staff. Was amazing helpful dorr staff and the check in went reasonably smoothly. We have booked a Spectacular room on floor 31 or above but we were checked in a Wonderful room. I queried this and it was changed straight away. We made our way to room 3208 and it was Spectacular. The room was a twin bedded and planty big enough for 2 friends - the view was amazing and we could have sat on the chaise all day watching it. We had room service for the evening meal and again it was amazing and we also ate in the Blue Fin on the last day and food was good again. The bathroom was a little see through when the lights were on but nothing that we could not deal with. We met a friend from Washington and she took us for cocktails in the Penninsula Bar at the top of the Penninsula Hotel which was great. Although the meal after at Johns in the East Village was amazing - a family run restaurant with amazing staff and other diners felt really comfortable and would reccommend to anyone - although take cash as they dont take cards. Shopping brill - weather great - all in all an amazing trip topped by a visit to Mamma Mia on Broadway. Also must not forget tomention Juniors for breakfast lunch cheesecake whatever 2 blocks up from the hotel next to the Lion King was amazing.
23,1991,"Oct 14 2009 	City Break	Mu wife and I have the last years in october gone to NY to shop and have some time without our two lovely kids.This year we booked W at Times Square. We booked a &quot;Fantastic Suite&quot; @ 650 USD a night. The suite was actually a living room and a &quot;sleeping room&quot;. It was fitted with a wonderfull bath room with WC and as well as separate WC room connect to the ling room. This was a very good room.The hotel is ideally situated !As a european I am used to have a shaver outlet in the bathroom - However no european plug were here - I asked for one plug and got one for the price of USD 10,-. This is a high price for a service that you would consider included.Every morning a complimentary newspaper were delivered ! However internet access costs USD 16,95 each 24H. I think the hotel better save the paper and have free internet - Which becomes more and more common. The internet speed were slow 400K/400KBut the hotel is wonderful and so is the staff !"
24,1991,"Oct 13 2009 	Wonderful everything..	Stayed here last weekend with my wife, it was the first time since our son was born 4 years ago that we got to spend a weekend away on our own. In my wife's own words, &quot;You hit it out of the park.&quot; From check in to check out, the staff was unbelievable and anytime we needed anything the staff was at our door within seconds. As far as the room is concerned, I agree with the other reviewers that it's more suited to romantic partners than family. We stayed in a spectacular room on the 54th floor overlooking Times Square. You could see Central Park in the distance and the Hudson off to the West. The room was very clean, no issues at all there, very sexy, the frosted walls surrounding the bathroom were very cool (and a big reason why it's not such a great place for families) and there was an immense smoky mirror on the wall above the headboard. Lighting was also very cool and so was the furniture. The waterfall sink in the bath was really neat (hard to pour water in the iron but the rain shower has a stream setting), and the shower was more than roomy enough for two with cool blue lighting. When we entered our room they had covered the bed and entrance with rose petals (as per my request), but they had forgotten the 6 chocolate strawberries I had requested. When I called down not only did they have them up in 10 minutes, but they removed the charges for both the petals and the strawberries from my account. When we noticed there was only one bathrobe they had someone up in 5 minutes with another one. My wife needed a dress pressed prior to us heading out to 21 for dinner, and even though she was past the deadline for having a garment pressed and returned same day, they whisked it away and it was waiting for us in the closet when we got back from a few hours of strolling around CP. The Bar downstairs is also very neat, and hopping at night, wish we would have gone there instead of wasting $40 on two drinks at Gilt. The room service was DELISH. I cannot recommend this place enough, yeah, it's in Times Square, but it's centrally located and you can walk to most places. My only complaint is that they need to invest in some new shades..I like it when I can kill the amount of light that comes into my room, and although it wasn't horrible, I've stayed at Hamptons that have better shades than the W.Great hotel, very sexy, wonderful service."
25,1991,Oct 9 2009 	Fun trendy hotel	My spouse and I stayed 3 nights at the W Times Square in August. The hotel location is great and the views are amazing. We are old for this hotel (50 somethings) but really enjoyed the vibe of the hotel-made us feel young again! Service was great and the rooms were on the small side small but comfortable and ultra modern. This is the second W hotel that we have stayed in (the other one was in Scottsdale) and we would definitely stay in another one again.
26,1991,"Oct 9 2009 	The location was in the center of excitement and non-stop people watching!	We loved the fact that the hotel was centrally located and it was a perfectly quick and short walk to the Good Morning America studio, which was perfect for us since we had tickets to the show during our stay. We were upgraded to a slightly larger room upon our arrival, due to our anniversary celebration, which was a nice touch. The hotel's amenities were average, but nice. The bar beverages were a tad over-priced, but what isn't in that area? We took full advantage of the hotel's concierge staff, as we had lots of questions and places to go. The staff was very knowledgeable and not always friendly, but helpful. We liked the fact that they issued umbrellas to their guest upon exiting the hotel during rainy days. We ate in the hotel restaurant a few times for breakfast and lunch. We were particularly impressed, especially since I became ill after eating a late nite dinner most likely due to cross contamination. Overall the stay was pleasant, but the hotel is a bit over-rated."
27,1991,"Oct 9 2009 	A Positive Experience for the Frequent Traveler	I have been travelling from LA to NYC since January, and Ive stayed in ten different hotels in Midtown (mostly Starwood and Marriott properties). There was a time when I had been moving from hotel to hotel after two or three stays because bad experiences that would eventually sour my interest in continuing my stays there. I had also been avoiding Times Square at all costs, but back in early April, I booked a room at the W-Times Square after some last minute travel plans left me no choice. Lucky for me, because I have returned to this hotel for my business travel ever since that first stay seven months ago.No hotel staff has been consistently friendlier or more accommodating than the folks at the W-Times Square. Im not sure how they manage to be so resilient with so much heavy traffic in and out of Blue Fin, high tourist volume, and my own brief glimpses into the frequent guest demands, but this teams got it in spades. In my experience, the door men are attentive and pleasant when hailing you a cab, or helping you out of one (thanks, Eric!). The front desk staff are pleasant and welcoming at check-in, and will go the extra step to explore options to best meet your preferences (thanks, Christopher, Ricardo and Pamela!). The staff who are on-hand to store, retrieve, or deliver your luggage to your room are quick and friendly, and I keenly appreciate the attentive housekeeping (and turn-down) services. No one hovers for tips, and Ive never experienced or seen a member of staff snubbing a solo or discrete guest in order to rush to the side of another guest who traveling with a mountain of designer luggage and is sporting predictably trendy gear. As a frequent traveler for business, efficiency, comfort and quiet are important to me. Many hotels in NYC are long overdue for refurbishment and they werent designed to accommodate the volume guests they have today (or their needs), so I really appreciate that the W-Times Square is fit for purpose. Small things add up, like the elevators being quick and functioning at all hours and the gym being equipped with plenty treadmills (and it is NOT located in the basement which is a huge plus). If I need something, the whatever whenever line is answered promptly at any hour I call. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that once beyond the bustling lobby, the hotel is quiet and work-friendly. The rooms have plenty of outlets in sensible places and enough flat work space to spread out comfortably. When its time for a break, I enjoy having access to BBC America and an iPod docking station, and it also goes without saying that the beds in the Starwood properties are the best sleep in town when Im ready to call it a night. I have spent many, many nights at the W-Times Square and I have only had positive experiences to report, which keep this weary traveler fiercely loyal."
28,1991,"Oct 8 2009 	Great Hotel	Spent five days in NYC over 4th of July weekend. My sons, ages 5 and 9 were super impressed with tthe W, as were the grown-ups. Absolutely no complaints! Staff was wonderful!"
29,1991,"Oct 8 2009 	Nice room excellent views but no free Internet?	Funky lobby with interesting lighting. Pleasant staff. Good-sized room (for NYC) with outstanding views, large windows and a comfortable bed. Thin walls weren't exactly soundproof however. Exercise room could use a few more machines too. And what's up with paying $450/night and not having free Internet access (either wired or WiFi) ? Hmph."
30,1991,"Oct 8 2009 	Wonderful time at the W hotel Times Square!!	Located on the perfect spot, around the corner of Times Square, the W hotel at is just magnificent. We had a wonderful room (I believe one class higher than a standard room) and that was great! Young and enthousiastic people are running the place. It made our trip to New York even more unforgettable. Th perfect place to stay in New York if you consider yourself hip and trendy, as the hotel is exactly that!Thanks W New York for a great experience!"
31,1991,"Oct 7 2009 	Great location friendly and helpful service but v small room	very helpful reception staff greeted us on arrival. The decor is modern, minimalist, very tasteful and relaxing. The location is fantastic on Times Sq as advertised. We stayed in a quad room but all rooms are the same size apart from suites so it was cramped. The rooms are supplied with excellent toiletries. All in all I'd stay there again but we'd go for 2 rooms which would make it pricy, and perhaps we'd get better value elsewhere."
32,1991,Oct 6 2009 	Loved the W	We stayed at the W Times Square before taking a cruise with NCL from the Manhattan Cruise Port.We spent 3 nights at the W and upgraded to a spectacular room. The view was well worth it. We loved this hotel and felt welcome from the time that we arrived.The hotel has a great entrance where you walk under the water feature to get to the elevators to take you to the 7th floor lobby. Check in was very smooth and when we got to our room we realised that we had not been given the room grade we had booked. This was not receptions fault but a clerical error from reservations. We called reception to double check and they advised to come straight down and they would correct it. When we got to reception the staff were very apologetic and the new key card was waiting for us.Our new room was lovely and exactly what we expected we would stay at this hotel any time. We heard no noise from Times Square and the room was very reaxing we loved the feel of the hotel.Whilst I certainly understand why somepeople dont like this hotel we loved it. If you like modern hotels with a young feel you'll love this hotel.
33,1991,"Oct 5 2009 	Pricey but worth it. Everything attended to!	Fanstastic may be overused, but it is the best way to describe the W Hotel Times Square.Everything was attended to. Doormen at the street were friendly and helpful. Check-in was smooth. Given late check-out, upgraded to suite and treated like royalty - for no good reason other than I was a guest.Views are amazing, location outstanding for mid-town. If this is your first time in NYC, indulge and spend a few more dollars to make a lifetime memory!"
34,1991,"Oct 3 2009 	FANTABULOUS!!!!!!!!	Our Trip started from Buffalo NY as we are from Hamilton, ON it is cheaper and faster to fly from Buffalo....Great Flight from Jet BLUE only took an hour each way....landed at JFK 15 mins got our luggage and off to the private town car to WNewYork Times Square. We arrived at approx noon our room wasnt ready not a big deal took our cell # and stored out luggage and off to enjoy our adventure.As this was an Anniversary present from me to my Husband....I had asked for a bottle of sparkling wine (and the hotel gave us chocolate covered strawberries for free) in our room for when we arrived.....Jason you are terrific the Whatever/Whenever service The Hotel called us then we checked in was smooth. I really dont understand the neg reviews....I wasnt expecting an overly spacious room as I have read about how small rooms are in NYC but our room was nice and spacious. The elevators ran smoothly not an issue of waiting to get to our rooms. I like the idea of using the room card in the elevators as a security measure as the Lobby bar....(the Livingroom ) is open to the general public.Just everything from the cascading waterfall as you come into the hotel the elevators to the 7th floor (lobby) was fantastic....as our first time in NYC we had a FABULOUS time!!!The Staff went out of their way to be of help with any concern or question that we may have had.....so a BIG thankyou to all the staff from the Doormen to the bellhops to the front desk to our Maid.We will most definately be staying here again when we return to NYC and we WILL return too much to see and do when we only had 4 days in the Big Apple!!!!"
35,1991,Oct 2 2009 	Excellent location - cool hotel	Fab hotel in the heart of times square. the views of the square from the rooms are amazing (as long as you don't suffer from vertigo!). Bliss products in the bathroom &amp; really comfortable beds.
36,1991,"Sep 30 2009 	Great location Great hotel Great staff would recommend to anyone!	I make several trips to NYC each year and always stay at W Times Square. You can't beat the location for the theater, shopping or great dining. The rooms are newly updated, the beds are wonderful, and the view is spectacular. New York City has many options for hotels but I always recommend W Times Square to friends or business associates. The staff is always so attentive, from the bellmen at the street, to the front desk, to room service. When they say &quot;Whatever, Whenever&quot; they really mean it. If you are looking for a Great hotel with a Great location and a Great staff, look no further."
37,1991,"Sep 30 2009 	Trendy and beautiful hotel in dynamic Times Square!""	The W Hotel Times Square is a fantastic hotel beginning with the striking cascading waterfall entranceway to the incredibly comfortable and wonderfully decorated yet functional rooms. Though set in the heart of Times Square where options for food and drink are plenty, the W Hotel offers the fantastic Living Room Bar and Blue Fin restaurant. The service and staff at the hotel are top notch. They are knowledgeable and truly aspire to create the best Whatever/Whenever service for those staying in the hotel. If you are looking for a hip hotel with staff prepared to cater to your needs all set in a prime Manhattan location, then this is the hotel for you."
38,1991,"Sep 29 2009 	Home away from home	Some W Hotels seems a little exclusive or aloof...not Times Square.I have been coming to this property for the last 5 years and it has only gotten better!I have to attribute the improvement to a staff that has become even more attentive and helpful. If I happen to have my wife along for the trip, they will always make sure that extra amenities are available to make the trip even more special. I'm oftern lucky enough to get an upgrade to one of the new suites and that is quite a treat! From the bell staff down on the street to the reception desk to the W insiders behend the scenes...all of these PEOPLE make the hotel a little more like home! I have been fortunate to become acquainted with a couple of the W Insiders (Tee and Christopher) who make best in class service their highest priority!The hotel has recently undergone a refurbishment that left the rooms fresh and crisp and the once smallish workout area has been expanded to offer substantial more space. I'm oftern lucky enough to get an upgrade to one of the new suites and that is quite a treat!I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a first class experience on Times Square"
39,1991,"Sep 28 2009 	The W Times Square is what a W should be	Business travelers - even those very loyal to Starwood - know that W's can be a mixed experience. Some of the original W's are getting a little long in the tooth, and others mix four parts of attitude to one part of services and making a comfortable, welcoming experience a challenge rather then the norm. At the W Times Square, the &quot;attitude&quot; part is left out and the &quot;service&quot; part is left in. From the front door to the top floor, I consistently find a welcoming attitude and, when the occasion calls for it, quick help with a question or request. The views are great fun, as is Blue Fin for any meal - but make a reservation as this is a popular place (sometimes even for breakfast)."
40,1991,"Sep 27 2009 	Trendy...	The W is located in Time Square so the location is excellent. When we entered the &quot;Living Room&quot;, there was a wait to check in. There was never quite enough people at the front desk. (Same at check out.) The Living Room itself was very trendy and cool with the fresh flowers and contemporary/loft feel. We enjoyed drinks a few times in the bar. They are expensive and the waitresses were a bit snotty, but that is what you expect in NYC. The room itself was nice. The room wasn't dirty, but not as clean as I would expect i.e. a bit of dirt build-up in the corners. We had two free nights so the value for us was excellent. If I had to pay full price, I would have been a bit disappointed."
41,1991,"Sep 26 2009 	The Best in the Square!!!	I have stayed in many hotels in Times Square over the past 5 years and 2 years ago I discovered W Times Square. From check-in to check-out my experiences have been nothing but good and on the ONE occasion I had to complain my issue was dealt with speedily and correctly. The staff are your typical new Yorkers and that's normally bad BUT they all have the 'W' way, Wonderful, Warm and Welcoming. The rooms are all well appointed and come with Bliss bathroom products, so no need to bring your own. There's a gym, a spa, an Apple mac in reception and a small shop. It's a really nice hotel in a great location, I've recommended it to 4 people (families too) and have never had any complaints, so give it a try."
42,1991,Sep 26 2009 	First visit to New York. Great Hotel	I really don't understand the complaints about this hotel. My wife and I enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Very good. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. We were in New York to celebrate my wifes 40th birthday. It was a huge success!!!
43,1991,"Sep 25 2009 	My home away from home	I come to NY once a month for business, and always stay in this hotel. I have come to be very comfortable here over the past couple of years and always stay when I return to NYC. The only complaint I have ever had is the noise from the busy Times Square area can be loud at times, but the staff has always been willing to move my room when needed. They now email beforehand when I am coming to help make my stay even more comfortable with anything I may need. I would definetely recommend, especially since the remodel. It is cool, chic, and the staff is very friendly. Fun bar scene too!"
44,1991,"Sep 22 2009 	Exquisite	This upscale hotel was a refreshing getaway from the crowds of Times Square. The waterfall effect as you enter the property was a unique experience.As you entered the hotel, the hustle and bustle of the city was left behind. The staff was very courteous, friendly and fun. The view from my room was spectacular...full length glass on two sides! The room decor is contemporary yet comfortable. Loved the Bliss toiletries."
45,1991,"Sep 22 2009 	Terrible Hotel Awful Service Dirty 	This has to be the worst hotel we've ever stayed in and we've stayed in some terrible ones before. We stayed there for 4 nights at the end of our honeymoon and it was a disaster from start to finish. We had booked a &quot;Spectacular Room&quot; but I assure you that it was anything but spectacular. The toilet had not been cleaned properly and every surface had dust and grime from the previous guests. They agreed to move us to a different room. As with the previous room the new room wasn't very clean. All the fixtures and fittings were also badly finished, and rather than feling classy and contemporary, the room felt very flatpack. There were sharp corners everywhere, wires and leads coming out of everything and gimmicky lamps that were difficult to turn on and off and did not light the room sufficiently. The hotel is marketed as being trendy and cool. It fails miserably in this respect.On arrival we were told that as it was our honeymoon, they would like to give us a bottle of champagne on the house much to our delight. However, it did not arrive. We enquired when the complimentary champagne would arrive but it still did not come. At this stage it became a matter of principle and after 6 embarrassing attempts over the 4 days we finally received a $5 bottle of sparkling wine when we returned to our room late on our last night there. A cheap bottle of sparkling wine in a hotel that charged us $24 for 2 vodkas and diet coke was a bit cheap.The staff were incompetent, ranging from the check in clerk to the door staff to the bar staff. The concierge was to his credit, at least appeared to be helpful despite the fact that he was unable to have a bottle of champagne delivered from the bar to our room in under 4 days.The straw to break the camels back came on departure when our luggage was being taken into storage for a few hours before we departed for the airport. Our ruck sacks and suitcases were simply left unattended in the lobby for 3 hours and not taken into storage as promised. Anybody could have taken all of our belongings.The hotel was staffed with people more concerned with acting cool and making you feel like you should be serving them than the other way around. It felt like the hotel was run by summer students rather than highly trained staff.In all, this was an absolutely terrible experience that I would not wish on any other human being on their holidays."
46,1991,"Sep 22 2009 	this is the most welcoming hotel in NYC	Over the course of the last 20 years, I have stayed in hundreds of hotels, but this is by far the most fantastic staff in any hotel I have visited anywhere (including some of the fanciest in the world). If you ask for it, they will try to accommodate you in any way they can. They are gracious, thoughtful and industrious. While I am a Platinum member of the Starwood Hotels and get particularly great treatment, I have never known any other hotel that bakes me chocolate chip cookies on arrival, makes sure I have the right number of pillows, hangers, electric outlets, water and lightning (their rooms can normally be a little too dark for me). The rooms are always comfortable (I often get upgraded to a suite if available): great beds and pillows, nice Bliss products and all the electronic amenities you need (like ipod decks, dvd players and good wireless and wired connections). While Times Square might not be everyone's first choice of location, it is easy to get anywhere in NY quickly and is certainly the most convenient place for theater, many restaurants, Central Park, a variety of museums and all public transportation. The restaurant downstairs (Blue Fin) is very good and the bar scene on the Lobby Floor is very lively. While the Four Seasons might be somewhat fancier, and the Ganesvoort a little trendier, the W Times Square will ensure you have a reliably great experience with all the luxury and hipness you need."
47,1991,"Sep 10 2009 	Not a 5 Diamond Hotel but met my basic needs	This is my first time at a W hotel. I love the look of the place and the staff seemed ok. I have heard the W was the new best luxuary hotel, but it did not win me over. I understand now that the W brand is considered an upscale hotel and is not luxuary. It just seemed to be missing the little things. I guess I am spoiled. No turndown service and it just felt like it was way understaffed. Not a bad hotel just not a top notch place. I don't think I will go back."
48,1991,"Sep 9 2009 	Roll Down The Shades	The fresh flowers and water filled ceiling of the entrance are beautiful. The concierge wasn't too knowledgeable about public transportation. His recommendation was to take a taxi because he doesn't take the Subway. Okay, Whatever. Ah ha - that's why the sign above the desk says Whatever. The bed was clean and comfortable. The flat screen TV could have been larger IMO and there was no HBO ? and the buttons on the remote were not responsive. The glass walled bathroom is a neat idea but I can see this being a problem if staying with friends. Our room also faced the Marriott's rooms so we could see them and they could see us ! There is no complementary coffee or tea. There is a mini fridge and Bliss products. The faucet on the sink is like a joystick and takes careful swiveling to avoid a dripping tap. The towels are stacked on metal slats so they fall in between and onto the floor easily. The over sized shower head didn't produce a powerful spray no matter how you spun the controls. We picked this b/c it is right in Times Square and it's close to all the restaurants, subway and shopping / broadway. You will hear street noise even if you are on the higher floors so bring ear plugs if you want a completely quiet nights sleep."
49,1991,Sep 7 2009 	Loved to modern design. Great service.	Fun place to stay...close to Broadway theaters and Restaurant Row. Right beside TKTS sales in Times Sq. Rooms were small but more interesting than traditional decor. Concierge was a great help.
50,1991,Sep 1 2009 	FANTABULOUS	Loved the W!!! Won't stay anywhere else in NYC if traveling for pleasure. TKTS access is the best and makes the trip. We had an amazing room (although small be warned) on the 54th floor overlooking Times Square....what could be bad? The decor is amazing yet not overdone or cheesy. The hotel felt intimate because the staff is amazing and super helpful and upbeat even though it is a huge property and very big city. Can't wait to return!!
51,1991,"Aug 28 2009 	Fantastic hotel the new room design is GREAT!	I stay at Starwood hotels often, and have stayed at the W in Times Square often for business and pleasure. I was there for 9 days, and I have to say the service was incredible! The staff was so friendly and personable. The new room decor is very nice and very functional! I loved the little chaise lounge next to the corner window overlooking Times Square. The bed was so comfortable! I loved everything about the upgrades. I highly reccomend this hotel to anyone!"
52,1991,"Aug 28 2009 	Amazing hotel great service loved the room.	Ask for room 4812. It's a corner room, overlooking Times Square. The room was spacious and the bathroom was roomy. Unlike the W on Lexington, I prefer this location. Concierge Michael was extremely efficient and gets and A+.The hotel is walking distance to all Broadway theaters and some pretty good restaurants. Blue Fin in the hotel is also superb."
53,1991,Aug 24 2009 	Beware of bathrooms!	We stayed here for 4 nights with our 2 teenage sons. We booked this room because we were promised a &quot;spectacular room with a spectacular view&quot;. The rooms were over $400 a night. We usually stay at the Marquis or Millinium but thought we would splurge. First thing we all noticed was the bathroom walls are made of glass so you can see right in. Crazy!! And our spectacular view was of the roof next door. We had to change rooms 3 times and the best view we ever had was of the Marquis. Apparently all of the rooms with the &quot;spectacular&quot; views are under renovation. We could not live with the bathroom situation so they came up and taped brown paper to the walls. Very unappealing but better than glass. And the internet was $17 a day for starwood members. Had better views at the Marquis and Millenium for much cheaper. Upside was the beds were comfortable and the room was large enough for the 4 of us. Great location and service.
54,1991,"Aug 23 2009 	Great experience.. wish I could have used more of the hotel	The Hotel is certainly a different experience. Don't expect your bags to be taken to your room as they assume you prefer to take them yourself. From the moment you arrive you feel you have arrived to a night club with bouncer at the door and everything. The hotel has a very modern feel, the room was clean and with great decoration. Bathrooms were very clean. Although the description when booking said &quot;dramatic views&quot;, when we arrived it was a view of the Marriott. The only negative thing about the room was that one of the bed pillows had an chewing gum sticked to the side. (kind of gross)."
55,1991,"Aug 21 2009 	This place was GREAT	I recently traveled with my sister-in-law and our 2 daughters, 9 &amp; 12. This hotel was fantastic as far as location, size and staff! From the time we walked in the door we were impressed with the staff and the &quot;hipness&quot; of the hotel, the girls were very impressed with the lobby!! The doormen were fabulous, and greeted us with huge smiles when exiting and entering the hotel. The staff is what made this place so very special. I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking, and I WILL stay here in the future."
56,1991,"Aug 17 2009 	Trendy 	I stayed here as the first leg of my honeymoon with my wife. The hotel was recently updated and have reasonable size rooms for New York standards and is in the midst of Times Square and very close to all of the popular Broadway shows. The hotel is very trendy, staff were welcoming and the amenities were good. The hotel bustles with night life every day of the week. I would definitely stay here again next visit to New York, highly recommended for quality, service and location!"
57,1991,"Aug 12 2009 	NOT A TYPICAL w	I have stayed at several W hotels over the past several years. They are typically modern sleek, cool and clean. This location came up short. It seems liked a typical hotel that tried to convert to a W without a fulls cale restoration. My room even had a note saying &quot;we hope you enjoy the recently updated room&quot; - yet it wasn't updated It was an old dark hotel with newer paint and furnishings but it was clearly apparent that it was not a full scale restoration. The bathroon floor had old rusty bolts sticking up through the floor (presumably from the prior confirguation), the toilet was old (with paint splattered on the tank from the recent paint job).The room was slightly smaller than I am used too. A nice flat screen. Overall a decent hotel but not a typical W. The bar was just OK (no food). There is no restuarant except the Blue Fin on the ground floor - seven floors below the lobby.Overall an average NY hotel, I was disappointed given hwo much I typically like W's.

58,1991,"Aug 11 2009 	W Times Square Is The Best!	I love this hotel. The location is perfect. The upgraded rooms are sublime. And I love, love, love the scent of the rooms. I stay here often and the staff always remembers me. Perfect!"
59,1991,"Aug 9 2009	W Time Square- What a Wonderful Weekend	I was initially skeptical to book a room here because I had heard that the rooms were extremely small; but I was pleasantly surprised! The room had more room than expected, with enough space to actually move around without walking into furniture(a rarity in NY). The room was one of the cleanest I have ever stayed in, the room attendant did a fantastic job! Whatever/Whenever Service was also very prompt, especially for a busy rainy summer weekend. The staff members encountered in the public areas were also friendly &amp; helpful.The location is right in the middle of the action, but also close enough to walk a few blocks to some of the best and most affordable eateries in the city(9th AVE). The ambiance of The W TS is really geared for younger hipsters, but you cans till enjoy your stay there without being part of that generation. I will go back!"
60,1991,Aug 7 2009	W Hotel in New York Times Square	The W does not stand for Welcome. Worst experience with a Hotel I've ever had. Need not say much about the Hotel except AVOID it.
61,1991,"Aug 3 2009 	Wife's Birthday Surprise!	The W Times Square is everything my wife and expected. We're a young trendy couple, and felt right at home! Anyone who complains about this hotel is simplyy nit picky because it couldn't be more perfect (modern, clean, great staff, location)!!! It is expensive, but you get what you pay for. Nothing is free here, including wi-fi...we paid $45 for 3 days of internet service."
62,1991,"Jul 29 2009 	Great Vibe	Stayed at the W in Times Square for 4 nights. The Staff were friendly except for one concierge, named Jason. I asked hows your day? and he replied &quot;tired&quot; with attitude. Then It seemed like it was a burden for him to help me out. But the other staff and concierges were all fine. This Place is steps from 2 metro station and Broadway Plays. 10 min train to SoHo, 15-20min train to Brooklyn, 10mins to Central Park. The area as you know is super touristy, but the hotel itself takes you away from the mayhem. The Bar has a very nice eclectic feel, the rooms are spacious with great views. We had a view of the Hudson. As with all W's, the toiletries are amazing. If you get a good rate.. this is definitely the place to stay in Times Square"
63,1991,"Jul 25 2009 	Good NY Hotel	I always stay here when in Manhattan. I like the location and the hotel is in general very nice. Two Subway stops are within a block. The rooms and public areas are trendy and contemporary. They have recently remodeled and the hotel is brighter on the inside. The value is just OK. Expect to pay premium rates at times. Get a room with no adjacent door, or you will suffer noise from the guests in the next room. Eat at the hotel Restaurant, Blue Fin. It will not disappoint. In-room internet is avail and expensive. No in room coffee."
64,1991,"Jul 25 2009 	Great Place to Stay and Enjoy Beauty of New York	Great Place to Stay in the center of Times Square...Very easy access to trains, broadway, plenty of great restaurant with walking distance. There is a friendly atmosphere and it is also clean and inviting to spend more hours at the hotel.Our stay was exceptional, everything ran smoothly and all the employees who we encountered at the W went out of their way to help if needed."
65,1991,"Jul 23 2009 	OMG!!!!	I must say this pictures from the website had me anxious to go. when we arrived the staff were wonderful. I planned a special bday surprise and had limited time to do all the running around. I called the Whateer/Whenever desk and the lovely Crysis got me Wish to come true. They arranged and picked everything i requested and kept me informed and offered suggestions...I am still floating off of my experience there and can't wait to go back. This hotel decor will take you away and the staff are the best. Trust me.....go and see. They are a little expensive compared to some, but they offer so many deals and discounts and the stay is well worth every penny......Thanx"
66,1991,Jul 12 2009 	Save Your Money!!!!	Unless you are dying to stay in Times Square look elsewhere. This W is ghetto compared to others I've stayed in. They longer have a spa which is sad because it was great little gem with excellent therapists. You can get much more for your money and better quality at other NY hotels.
67,1991,Jul 2 2009 	Another nice stay at the W Times Square	I have stayed at the W Times Square on several occasions before. I have to admit that the last time I stayed I was not completely satisfied and really felt that the rooms needed to finally be renovated. This time around the rooms are FINALLY renovated and I have to say I really like the new feel. IMHO they should have changed out the vanities in the bathroom but I still like the overall redo. Location is good if you are in town for sightseeing or shopping but not ideal if you are looking for something quite of course. Only service issue I had was with the bellman who still seemed to think he was a model only working there to chat and pick up the girls staying at or walking by the hotel. Aren't those guys supposed to help guests and actually take care of peoples luggage and hail cabs? Not the ones working when I was there. Other than that a great stay but I really wish management would hire some decent bellman because this has been an issue for quite some time.
68,1991,Jun 30 2009 	Anniversary	This hotel is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in. It was right off of Times Square. The bell men were awesome and had fun doing their jobs. It is on the pricey side but the price went down over $150 by the time I booked the room and the time we checked in. Everything you need or want is within walking distance. NY pizza is within walking distance no matter which way you go. This hotels has everything you need to have a great time in a great city. I am looking forward to going back.
69,1991,"Jun 16 2009 	This Hotel Defines What ""W"" Hotel Really IS!	If you are looking for a quite time with your family or children. This is not the W for You.If you are looking for a fun atmosphere with updated rooms and chances to meet some hot (random) people while you are in town, this is the place to be.I love this W. I mean really, its NICE. This is how W hotel is suppose to be. Hip, Trendy, good night/bar scenes. Service is however hit or miss. Some people are VERY nice yet some are the typical W wannabe attitude (esp during afternoon shift, the welcome desk folks are pretty whatever).The hotel renovated last year so everything is still very new. I forgot the name of the designer but its to my liking. Oh yea, the welcome desk is like a nice bar feeling with the lights n all. Check out the concierge desk's tabletop glass too! It was designed by some MIT guy. Gonna check it out.They have W store in house too for those who likes W stuff. In house restaurant Bluefin is very popular restaurant in time square area and I think its reasonably priced for a place like this. There are also cheap pizza places located on 8th. Ave.The Room: Upgraded to Cool Corner room on 48th Floor. Able to see time square from my window! woo! Everything is brand new, the moment that you walk in, you'll realize this W is &quot;Not your typical type of hotel room&quot; type of room. Its very hip! I liked it from the moment that I walked into this room. Being in the corner I also get to see more of the time square from my room. Hooray!The Bathroom: Voyager Shower, means, you can see people's shadow while they are in the bathroom. This will be kinda annoying if you are travelling with your family. Not an issue if you are traveling w/ your lover or solo traveler like me. However, the soundproof for this hotel is bad, esp when I had a connecting room. Good thing is that my neighbor went to bed early.Gym (AKA Sweat): Very spacious with latest workout equipments. They have a shower too but they don't have any sauna or jacuzzi or pool on-site.Acura Service: Its there, but they didn't set up a table like other W's. Its first come, first served based. Great place for stay, first time visiting NYC (location, location to the subway, location to the time square). Must try to stay here once to experience the real W Hotel!"
70,1991,"Jun 15 2009 	W is for ""Wonderful""	We were a little hesitant about making a reservation at this hotel because of some of the other reviews, but we were very pleasantly surprised. We had a wonderful time at the W Times Square . Our room was beautiful and it looked like it had just been renovated! The little chocolates that were left in the room everyday was a very nice touch, along with the note from the General Manager on our first day. We also noticed that we never hear the housekeeping staff, but the rooms are always clean.Everyone we came in contact with at the hotel were very accommodating and we felt like they genuinely cared about the quality of our stay.There was one staff member in particular who helped to make our stay extra memorable. Gil (I think one of the security staff?) was especially helpful and went out of his way to make our stay more special. We felt like VIPs in the hotel and also that we had a friend who would take care of us. We've stayed in many W's over the years now and the service in general is very good, but the service at this location was outstanding!We couldn't have asked for a more perfect stay."
71,1991,"Jun 10 2009 	Leave the chaos outside enter into an oasis.	Ok my husband had just given up his corporate apartment in Murray Hill so he booked the W at Times Square just for something different. I will also say that he is a road warrior and is top tier on most hotel chains. Times Square is the last place that I would choose to stay because it is just ground zero for tourists at all times of the day and night. I personally don't like walking outside to a sea of people. Murray Hill is more residential and worlds aways from this chaos so that is where I am coming from. As soon as we arrived at the W, we were greeted outside by very friendly staff. You enter and then go up the elevator to the reception area. In the same area is a bar with lounge music and lots of people. Ok so not really quiet, but honestly it was not annoying. Front desk people were great and were extremely helpful. Our room was a corner one and had a great view of Times Square below. Noise was very minimal. I loved the grey/taupe walls and the cool colors used to accent. room was quite striking and not jarring (in other words very easy on the eye). The bed was super comfortable with ample pillows.Very cool and comfy I wish I had a bed like this at home. I really could have just taken my favorite books and spent the entire time in bed reading.There was an Ipod doc/stereo for your Ipod. How great is that! Lots of room for laptops and other electronic devices. I was most impressed with the W's security as my room key somehow stopped working. The room was in my husband's name and so security went up with me. I must say that I was very impressed that they were careful to make sure I was who I said I was. The security man they sent up with me was extremely professional and courteous. He did his job! When we checked out I saw the same officer and he remembered me by name. I actually would stay here again, yes someone who did not want to stay in Times Square.By the way the rate we got here was much better than the W at Union Square. If you want something a little different but don't want to sacrifice comfort, give the W Hotel at Times Square a try. It was well worth it for us."
72,1991,"May 29 2009	Amazing hotel blighted by a receptionist.	Having a mindset of never dwell on a problem, I would never usually complain. However, on this occasion I think I might issue a warning. After a full day and half a night of travelling to get to NY, bartering with a receptionist was near enough the last thing we wanted to do. How disappointing it was to arrive at the hotel at 10.30 in the evening (3.30 am London time) only to be told that our room, which my boyfriend paid extra for, had been given away to an overflow customer who had originally booked another hotel. Im not sure what warranted the priority of this other customer, apparently booking and paying for a room in advance does not ensure that you can actually stay in it. Instead we were told to stay in a downgraded room for the first night and that we would be moved to our proper room during the following day.However, this might have been an issue which I could have come to terms with if there was a degree of remorse shown by the receptionist and perhaps a refund of the difference, maybe even an upgraded room, sadly it was not to be. After suggesting that we were not particularly happy with these arrangements we were offered credit for the Blue Fin restaurant. This we declined as we were not certain that we would eat there. Next he offered us a complimentary drink each at the bar. After bumping this up to 4 complimentary drinks, we settled. Its just a shame we didnt get the apology.Some might think me prude, but when it comes to bathrooms, I might be inclined to favour comfort over style or at least a goodly amount of both. When contentment in the bathroom is forsaken for a glass wall, I would suggest that the design was perhaps not as well thought out as it could have been. I can see how some might see it as fun but mostly I found it off-putting. However, it is not this to discredit what otherwise was a good hotel. The doormen were friendly and attentive. They helped with our bags and called for a taxi for the return journey to the airport. The location and the view from our proper room was amazing. The bed was unbelievably comfortable and spacious and the room itself was clean and stylish."
73,1991,"May 24 2009 	Teens will love this place	We were originally booked at another hotel, they offered to move us here for free. I let my birthday daughter (16) choose which hotel she wanted. After walking in the door with all of the water things in the ceiling and the modern decor, she and her friend opted for this hotel. It is truely beautiful. The front desk staff, especially Julian, were terrific, nice and helpful. When I asked for a coffee pot for my morning coffee, it was in my room when I returned with our bags (oh, they had a room ready for us-it was only 12)-free, like the other hotel I was booked at.Yes, the rooms are a little small, but the teenagers loved all the &quot;cool&quot; stuff that decorated the room, the huge flat screen tv (with HBO, HBO2), bathroom stuff, robe, throw blanket and extremely comfortable bed. Airconditioner worked great. A personal thing that I was uncomfortable with (with the teenagers in the room) was the bathroom glass wall. You could see the silhouette of whom ever was in the bathroom. If you have a small child, he will not be able to reach the sink, shower was great/hot.Security-I felt very safe-you need to use your room card to push any button to get above floor 7 (lobby). GYM-did not use, but took a look and am an exerciser-great modern equipment-lifting stuff and eliptical/treadmill kind of equipment. BAR/LIVINGROOM-saw many people hanging out, comfortably having a few-modern. FOOD-did not eat there as I could feed my whole family breakfast on the charge for just a yogurt and cereal. Went next door to get muffins and bananas at StarBucks.LOCATION-Remember this IS Times Square, if you want peace-go to the country (it is where we are from-no lights, people &amp; tons of stars in the sky). We were on the 31st floor and had a side view of times square, on this Memorial Day weekend Saturday night it was loud but when the airconditioner was on, we could not hear anything and we were so tired nothing could stop us from sleeping. The morning noise was not a problem at all. We walked to and from Penn Station, Gershwin Theater, and Build A Bear. As a mom with two pretty teenagers in the &quot;big city&quot; I felt very comfortable and safe walking all around. I have been here a few times before, just take precautions as you would anywhere. I googled maps to help with locations and directions and managed just fine."
74,1991,"May 23 2009 	Brighter lighting in rooms please.	Just back from a stay at the W Times Square, loved the floral scents, the hip decor, the fun cocktails in the Living Room, the wonderful toiletries, the location. All in all, nearly perfect for our business meeting, especially when it came to relaxing after the meeting! Only one suggestion, more lights in the room, please. It is nearly impossible to get any work done with the dim lights provided. I had to raise the shades, just to read the hotel guide in the room. Business travelers who want to look at documents in their rooms should consider bringing along their own lights."
75,1991,"May 18 2009 	Bouncers on the door!!!	I was on a short break with my girlfriend. The hotel is in an amazing location although it took some careful dance moves to get from the taxi to the hotel entrance with our baggage. You then had to negotiate your way past the bouncers on the door, through the disco and the beautiful people and finally you made it to reception. Very nice staff who happily upgraded us from a Marvelous room to a Fantastic room. Apparently they are identical although one was on the 12th floor and one was on the 51st floor. The room was ultra modern and in my view the designers have tried too hard. Too large cases and no storage space at all. One small drawer and several fake drawers which were sealed shut. I did complain but apparently all the rooms are like this! Great design with no thought as to the eventual user. We had to complain about the cleanliness on more than one occasion however the staff were quick to help out and send someone up to sort the problems. Very noisy location and with the window open, well what would you expect for Time Square! First trip to New York and absolutely loved the place. Less enamored with the hotel though. After a busy day sight seeing etc, I needed a little tranquility on my return to the hotel and the W didn't offer this. Not a complaint, simply an observation."
76,1991,"May 14 2009 	Style over Substance - with great location.	I stayed with my heavily pregnant wife at the end of April. We booked with Amex so we got upgrade on arrival, stay 3 nights get 1 free, free breakfast,early check in, 4pm check out, a $85 credit for the blue fin restaurant/bar and a limo from JFK.When we got to hotel there were no door staff to help with bags or point us in right direction. We quickly found check in on the 7th floor. This was smooth and he told us how to get to our room on the 52nd floor. The room looked very good, great view but had absolutely no practicality. The size of the room was fine, but the wardrobe was tiny and there was just no draws to put anything. There was plenty of space where storage could have gone, but the room was too trendy for its own good. We phoned down to say we were not happy and very quickly the service manager arrived. She admitted that although the rooms had just been renovated, it had not been done particularly well and most people do complain about lack of storage. She said most rooms would be like this but she would upgrade us to a suite if we liked. We did.We had to go back to reception and get new rooms keys. When we found our new room the service manger arrived with a bag of gifts and a hand written note congratulating us on our future arrival. A nice touch.The suite was great, very large, 2 big wardrobes and 1.5 bathrooms. The main bathroom was tiny though. The living area toilet was big but had no where to hang a towel. Overall a good room but needed more lights. Far to dark at night time. In summing up the rooms they look great but they are not designed for someone to use them.The free breakfast had to be taken in the room and on the sixth day was starting to get boring.I used the gym most days and although it is small it has very modern equipment and was always quiet.Because we stayed 6 nights we had 2 $85 credits at the blue fin. We used one for a set menu meal which was very good and the other for Friday night cocktails which was better.I did have to remind them of the free nights on check out, but the staff as usual were very good. I did also take advantage of the free Internet in the lobby, no need to pay for it in your room, if you are just checking emails and i also had quite a few of the welcome drinks.I would recommend this hotel, but pack light and you don't really come to New York to stay in your room do you?"
77,1991,"May 10 2009 	Good with minor issues	If you after being in th eheart on Time Square, you cant go wrong with the W. Rooms are very well refurbished and chic. Very hip. Service was excellent overall, though a few pointers about the room....1) ensure you get a corner room ( better views and more airy) 2/ bathroom is tight 3) Walls extremely thin ( could hear our neighbors having a fight!!). Otherwise couldnt really fault hotel and staff"
78,1991,"May 8 2009 	OK- BUT NOT A FULL PRICE	FYI- These rooms are small! Four women sharing one room, was no problem when we stayed at The W Union Square, but here we were cramped! There is no way those are double beds. One false room and someone would have fallen out. Also, our room got really hot and they suggested we open the window instead of them fixing the freaking air conditioning... So we really had a chance to experience the sounds of NYC.I have to admit the staff were great! We arrived to all of our shows in style because the doorman had a nice Cadillac Escalade take us to our show...for FREE! We just made sure to tip him handsomely.Finally, were able to eat at the Bodega next door really cheap. We had breakfast there everyday for less than $5."
79,1991,"May 7 2009 	Comfortable rooms friendly staff and great food.	I stayed at the W Times Square for several months a few years back and always liked the hotel. I stayed there again this weekend and the experience was noticeably improved (again from a already high standard). The staff was very friendly and helpful (biggest improvement from prior stays), the food (dinner and breakfast at Blue Fin) was outstanding and the room was comfortable and well designed."
80,1991,"Apr 27 2009 	Hotel designed like a club!	Location Location Location. Heart of Times Square. Walking distance to everything- to Broadway, Hell's Kitchen, MOMA to Central Park. The hotel is designed like a club- a fabulous bar with great martinis! This is a great business hotel. Each floor is in a different theme colour, and the rooftop is a great place for a typical new york party. Slightly overpriced, but if you want location- this is it."
81,1991,"Apr 22 2009 	Cool and Trendy	We stayed one night in W Times Square for a family birthday and Broadway show with my two children and parents. This hotel is very cool and trendy with a fun entrance and check in area/lobby. When we tried to check in several hours before check in time, one of our rooms was ready. However, when we got to the room, my parents weren't happy with the location next to the elevator. When I went downstairs to the desk to ask for another room, the receptionist not only politely moved us but made the effort to find us connecting rooms and actually upgraded us to a corner room with no extra charge. My parents were thrilled with their corner room and we all loved the newly redone and trendy details in both rooms.Later in the evening we spent some time at the extremely cool bar in the hotel which was fun and the next morning ate a delicious breakfast at the restaurant downstairs.Valet parking was convenient and fast.Location is smack in the middle of Times Square and while this is convenient and fun it is also extremely noisy (even on the 48th floor) so keep this in mind. This city really doesn't sleep, people!"
82,1991,"Apr 20 2009 	Simply Amazing best choice we could have made!	My daughter and I took a long awaited, very special trip to New York and were recommended The W at Times Square. Well, it was everything, and more, that we expected. She, 16, and myself wanted to stay at a trendy New York Hotel, in Times Square where we would be central. It was simply amazing! The service was impeccable, friendly and outgoing staff, and the music to die for! I wish I had bought all their CD's! The beds were extremely comfortable, the view of Times Square was delightful! The only complaint we had was the lack of lighting in the room, however, they were keen on supplying an additional lamp which made the difference. The restaurant had the best breakfast as well! What a great experience! Highly, highly recommend this hotel! Enjoy!"
83,1991,"Apr 20 2009 	Best Hotel experience we have ever had.	Stayed here for our Honeymoon and was blown away by the service. Payed for a regular room and was upgraded to a high floor with a corner view for free. We let them know it was our honeymoon and they spread rose peddles on the floor/bed the first day, the second day there was a dozen roses and free champagne in the room. Anytime we asked for anything they went out of there way to help us. Loved the entry way to the hotel and living room(bar). The location is great as long you want to stay in Times Square, you walk out your door and you are right in the middle of everything We have stayed in other W's but this was our favorite and best overall experience with any of their hotels. Can't recommend this hotel enough. Anytime we visit NYC this is where we will be staying."
84,1991,"Apr 15 2009 	Horrendous service (nice location)	This was a special birthday weekend trip to NYC. A special room (glass corner room) was chosen and paid for- a ton of money was spent! We got there and the room wasnt ready- ok fine- however when we asked to leave our bags with them as we had a show to catch- what a mess. We sat with several other guests all waiting for the &quot;bag guy&quot; when we approached the front desk again to say we are running late- &quot;no you must wait&quot;after more time went by we approached again- hoping to sit at the bar and wait &quot; no you must wait by your bags&quot;What? what is this airport security?? what a joke- the front desk should have just given us some damn tags and let us go on our way!!!When we came back hours later- were the bags in our room? No. We had to call for them.When the bell boy showed did he show us around our room? No. Several hours later we accidentally discovered the fridge, a hidden shelf panel and the rest (?) of the amenities we were paying top dollar for. And very funny- there was a housekeeping cart outside of our room all afternoon and all night long!! We could have been at the Howard Johnsons for what we experienced and saw."
85,1991,"Apr 12 2009	one of the best hotels i have ever stayed at	i am pretty young and love staying at the new and hip W hotels. The bell hop staff in the front is helpful from the moment you step out of the taxi. the rooms are pretty high up (i was on the 42nd floor!!) and have a great view of times square! the room was nice and so was the bathroom. the bathrooms are filled with bliss products (a hip new york spa with quite pricey lotions, shampoos etc). the windows and walls did a great job at blocking out the loud noises of new york at night. i would live there if i could!! one of the best hotels i have ever been to! [:"
86,1991,"Apr 10 2009 	Not what you would expect...	After a short stint in a budget hotel, we decided to splurge for three nights in a suite at the W. The room was beautiful and the views were great. Unfortunately, we had a terrible stay to say the least. The service was so bad; I could not believe we were paying for it. The front desk staff was great, but the room service attendant and the restaurant staff were the rudest people we had ever encountered. Its like Do they know they work in hospitality?!!! I could not believe it when our food came cold from Room Service and the server is arguing with us telling us it wasnt. We go to the restaurant and the service was slow and the server was very short with us. I wanted my money back! We got home and could not understand how we could have gotten better service at an economy hotel than at the W. I wouldnt pay top dollar for that place, ever!"
87,1991,"Apr 9 2009 	Living Room Experience	The W Hotel experience was absolutely exceptional; however their external partners such as the Living Room were not as exceptional. We were humiliated and accused by a server of stealing her cell phone, when I and my partner are paying $400 per night. We are offended to say the least! The value of the phone is not the issue but the rather the nonresponsive attitude of the Manager of the Living Room, Lindsey. Although she made us feel like everything was fine and she understood that the phone was near us and we simply surprisingly handed it over to the server, we were asked to leave like criminals at the servers request. We have never in our lives been so humiliated as tonight. We came to NYC to celebrate my boyfriends birthday and I was so sadden by the situation that I was ready to check out and leave the hotel immediately, however, Vitaly Panov, Hotel Manager, listened to our side of the story. He was kind enough to explain that the hotel has no control of the concessions such as the Living Room, owned by Randy Gerber. As SPG members, we know Starwood very well and they are very lucky to have Vitaly on board. I hope in the future, the hotel has some control of these concessions so that guests are treated with respect and are not subject to the mistreatment, humiliation and arrogance of the Living Room. Please note that the only reason why we will stay for the remainder of our stay in NYC with the W is due to Vitaly Panov."
88,1991,Apr 6 2009 	Best Hotel I have stayed at in USA	After running screaming into the night from Edison next door washed up on the shores of heavenly 'W' Hotel. After phone call from Travel Agent in Australia to Kiwi Night Manager we were given good rate for 4 nights and then upgraded to a room on 47th floor overlooking Time Square. Staff could not have been more friendly or helpful.By accidint when leaving around 04.30 one morning for day trip to Niagara falls we left 'do not disturb' sign on door (our fault) on return that night room wasn't made up as one would expect. Rang room service who came straight up and cleaned the room.
89,1991,"Mar 31 2009 	For Location Excellent	This is now my 3rd stay @ W Times Square and apart for the renovated rooms pretty much everything remains the same. Okay so the rooms may not be kitted out the best, poor lighting, not enough wardrobe space or hooks in the bathrooms &amp; still no coffee/tea making facilities in the room.The bed is still the best I have ever slept in, even better than my own. The noise from Times Square on the 45th floor is nothing to lose sleep over. The location is excellent, central for most attractions and tourist sightseeing, The staff are friendly &amp; helpful, The bar is still hip &amp; makes a great place for cocktails. Stay here if you want a Times Square loction and be in the centre of the action. Don't stay here if you are on a Business Trip ? need to work in you room."
90,1991,"Mar 31 2009 	Right in the Middle of Times Square Expectations Met	If you are planning a trip to NYC, have some money to spend and want to stay in the Mecca of all tourist zones... the W Times Square is for you. This is a great hotel and has everything you'd expect in a W, although scaled down to a &quot;Manhattan Size&quot;. You're not going to find huge rooms here (outside of the suites) but if you are in NYC and spending a lot of time in your hotel, you're not optimizing your trip.The fitness center is adequate and the staff and service is standard. This is not a &quot;blow you away in awe&quot; W like some of that brand can be, but compared to other Times Square options, this is definitely the hippest and trendiest chain I've stayed at. They're is nothing wrong with this place, however if you need peace and quiet, you might want to look elsewhere... there's always something going on if not in the hotel, then on the street."
91,1991,"Mar 29 2009 	Simply lovely...	I was in town for a conference and this hotel was picked by a colleague for its location and fair price. I was thrilled---always loving the W brand, this hotel did not disappoint. First walking in, the floral scent is lovely and inviting. I love the modern design, water features and fresh flowers everywhere... The reception area and bar have a cool, modern edge. The staff were very friendly and helpful (storing luggage and help at concierge--aka &quot;whatever&quot; desk).Our room was a good size for NYC (2 beds and it fit luggage!). It was modern and clean. Bed and linens were top rate. The bathroom was complete with tub, shower and fantastic Bliss products.Location is great for the tourist and Jatvis conference attendee. Yes, there is some traffic/siren noise, but common anywhere in NYC. Overall, I highly recommend!"
92,1991,"Mar 27 2009 	great hotel wish i was there now	we travelled to the w with our two teenage sons for our sons 19th birthday First impressions the elevator area with waterfall was great.The checkin very fast and we were quickly in our 31st floor room great room, nice size ,comfy beds and very clean.The lobby bar is lovely candles everywhere and lovely smelling lillies,gets very busy and is a little exspensive.The hotel is situated ight on times square couldnt be better. All the staff were very helpful.We visited all the usual places empire state,central park ,greyline tour ,hms intrepid thats great but make sure you allow at least half a day.we also saw the nicks lakers game at madison square gardens the lads loved this.We used the theme resterants planet hollwood,hard rock cafe and espn zone thats great with kids.If your travelling to newyork a must is the purchase of a newyork city pass it saved us a fortune. When we return to newyork well definately stay at w i would recommend it to anyone."
93,1991,"Mar 20 2009 	Trendy modern and comfortable but dark and cave-like	If you are looking for a hip and trendy boutique-style hotel filled with trendy people smack dab in the middle of Times Square, then look no further. My room was comfortable and clean with a great bed. Times Square is a very noisy place to sleep, however, if you are not used to that level of noise (even on the 39th floor), and the flashing lights from the signs can be a bit much. This is probably a great hotel for a romantic or sightseeing trip, but don't expect to do any serious work in your room, as the lighting is strictly mood-oriented, and not made for working. I could also hear more details than I cared to from my next door neighbor's telephone conversation."
94,1991,"Mar 19 2009 	Overdesigned and too cool staff	Don't get me wrong - I like W Hotels and stay there quite frequently (Hong Kong, Seoul, Montreal etc.) but the W Times Square in New York has been one of those experiences you don't want to repeat.The first room we got has been so small that 2 persons couldn't unpack the suitecases, store the clothes, have breakfast... Further the bathroom has been so much overdesigned that they forgot to fit enough lamps. For my wife it has been impossible to do make-up, for me shaving has been a problem. So, since I've got a Platinum SPG card, I called and complained. The y promissed a bigger Suite for the next day, okay, fine. When returning from restaurant we saw that they forgot the &quot;turn-down-service&quot; (which you can expect at approx. US$ 400/night). We've been informed that the W isn't star rated and therefore we can't expect 5 star service. &quot;Turn-down&quot; they perform only on special request and automatically when you're Platinum SPG member (which I am - but still they forgot). The next day we were moved to a nice Suite. But again, the thing has been so much overdesigned that they forgot the light switches. So for switching on/off the light you have to go to each and every lamp to switch it on/off... And again, the light in the bathroom has been too little, everything too dark!Breakfast (in-room) has been included in our package, that's maybe why the croissants always had been from the previous day... But the juice (freshly squeezed) has been perfect!Another positive feature of the W is free-WiFi at the bar/lounge (which is quite crowded and noisy) - but who cares, it's free - while in the room you have to pay.The problem started the last (3rd) day. Again they forgot &quot;turn-down-service&quot; and in the morning they even didn't bring new shampoo... So I called and the lady insisted that they performed turn-down-service, that she had been present in person, that they exchanged towels and put chocolate. I informed her that neither there're fresh towels or shampoo nor chocolate. But she insisted. Anyway, after a while, she told me that we'll get shampoo in a moment. So I waited 15 minutes before I called again. She said &quot;immediately&quot; and I waited another 10 minutes, sitting on the sofa at the entrance door. Then I called again and she informed me that the person had been there, knocked - but I didn't open. I told her that I'm sitting by the door, no TV, no radio, no iPod, no drugs, asked her if she has a wrong room number. She confirmed the right number and told me she'll call back. 5 minutes later she called and told me that the shampoo is now standing in front of the door. I opened - and guess what - no shampoo. 5 minutes later really somebody came, knocked and gave me a shampoo... More than 30 minutes waiting, wasting, for shampoo!I think the problem is that at the W Times Square the staff wants to be sooo cool, too cool to perform service. Nothing is really serious -and that's a problem for business travelers.W at Court is fine, W Times Square a nightmare!"
95,1991,"Mar 13 2009 	Couldn't get any better	As we arrived at the W Times Square Hotel we were greeted by an over head waterfall, which was stunning. You have to go in the lift to take you upto the reception area. When we arrived it was abount 7pm on a friday night and the reception/bar area was buzzing with people. The decor was very modern but cozy aswell. The staff at the reception were very friendly and helpful.As we got out of the lift to go to our room the corridors were decorated in gold, which loooked very luxurious.As we entered the room were very pleased at the size of the room (compared to the W on Lexington avenue), we had a very large window with a chaise lounge next to it were we took advantage of the spectacular view of times square and the hudson river. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was to a very high standard also.You could not have asked for a better location, we were right next to the tkts booth and everything else times square had to offer.When i go back to New York i wouldn't even think of staying anywhere else."
96,1991,"Mar 6 2009 	Style but a bit more substance needed	Yup, it looks great.(Very) Comfy bed, clean, clean, clean. Love the toiletries. Great (24 hour for those with jetlag early wakening) gym.2 minutes to Times Square subway and a panoply of subway lines to the rest of Manhattan. Handy indeed.And very close to the E line at 50th St straight out to the JFK airtrain if you want to avoid that big cab fare to the airport or touring umpteen hotels to pick up fellow passengers.That costs, and the costs are about average for the size of room we had in Times Square. You want cheap? You'll be walking a lot further.So, a great looking hotel in a brilliant location.BUTIf you want a bath (not just a shower) make sure you ask for a room with one when you book (and online booking may not tell you). After a long day in the snow and minus 5 a shower doesn't always do the job.And you'll be living out of your suitcase. One clothes drawer and one shelf in the cupboard. We travel pretty light, but 2 people for 5 days with very variable weather means SOME luggage. And there's nowhere to put it.Ignore the &quot;table reserved&quot; signs in the lobby bar. They all are, and it's just to keep interlopers at bay. Don't expect rapid service in the bar either. Overall: a good hotel, which is a little up itself, but if you want facilities and location it ticks all those boxes. I stayed in the Times Square Hilton 2 years ago and the W is better on many fronts. If I were staying in Times Square again I'd use the W."
97,1991,"Feb 27 2009 	Great location Great vibe	Great hotel! Love the Vibe, love the location. The only drawback was the tiny little rooms. My wife and I stayed at all of the W in New York over the years but this one is a ittle cramped for my style. The bar and lobby bar is great place to hang out and have drinks, a great launching pad for the night! There's nothing like checking in, leaving your bags with the bell hop and getting a much needed drink post travel drink in the lobby as they bring your bags to your room. The club was a nive place to hang out at the end of the night as well. All in all, if you want to be in the thick of time square and don't mind with the bright lights, the traffic noise from your small room, this is the best place to stay in the area. If you want the ammenities of the W, much larger room and a much quieter stay, try the W Tuscany, or the W Court. They are side by side near Grand Central and worth the price!"
98,1991,"Feb 21 2009 	Wonderful and Hip - Will be back	We stayed for 2 nights on our way back to Australia. The W Hotel is in a great location fronting Times Square. The refurbished room was really nice and spacious for a New York hotel. All staff were friendly and helpful and dressed in funky uniform. The hotel is hip and cool, we loved the bar off the reception area - the ambience was hip, relaxing and comfortable. We will definitely be back when we next visit New York."
99,1991,"Feb 8 2009 	Great Location and Staf	As other reviewers have mentioned this Hotel has a great location. The only issue was the bathroom which is funky and lacks privacy. This was an issue since our son ( age 22 ) was with us. The staff was great, I left my favorite pair of sandals and when we called after our cruise they sent them home to us. I was so happy."
100,1991,"Jan 21 2009	Whatever Whenever says enough	What a perfect way to spend our anniversary. This was our second stay here and remember exactly why we returned and why would not stay anywhere else in NY ever. The hotel is first class in everyway. Very modern in every way. Awesome flat screen and a bed that will make you never want to get out. We were really taken care of. Any request I had they went about and beyond to accommodate it. The service was amazing. From the awesome guys outside in the cold, to the front desk and concierge who helped me with all the details of the city. Thank you W for making my wife and I's anniversary weekend perfect. See you soon. Mike Hamilton"
101,1991,"Jan 13 2009 	5 strikes and your are out!	Within 24 hours, five strikes against this property which in the future, I will certainly avoid and suggest you do the same. For the hustle and bustle that is Times Square NY, the hotel property itself was very pleasant, clean, and modern. There were a few issues that I have yet to get over, even though three weeks have passed since our stay. W Hotel touts itself as a trendy, and dare I say sexy, contemporary resort. For me it was far from that. The purpose of my stay was a romantic pre-Christmas stay with my girlfriend prior to the family fun and chaos that Christmas brings. Upon arrival we checked in to the hotel and went to our room. The room was clean, trendy, and simple. We booked with our Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) points and paid an extra amount of points for an upgraded room. For an upgraded room, it was not worth the investment. (Not the first strike, but worth noting) We asked for a better view room to overlook Times Square which was available but they wanted $50 more for the night to move 4 rooms over. The hotel was rather empty and as a SPG who paid an upgrade points already, I would have hoped they would upgrade for no fee. Not the case so we declined. (Strike 1)After a hectic morning of travel, we just needed to take a rest before we hit the town and fell asleep immediately. Within 40 minutes or so of falling asleep, we were woken up by a loud knock on the door. Upon answering, we met a gentleman asking to change lighbulbs. Yes, woken up about an hour after checking in to change lightbulbs! For a hotel that claims to focus on comfort and the guest, this was not a good start. (Strike 2)We then went to the concierge for advice on broadway plays. Although polite and friendly he was not well informed. In fact, he mis-informed us about the showtimes for the play we wanted to see and we missed the deadline for the reduced price tickets and had to skip dinner to make the earlier showtime. A high end trendy hotel with a misinformed concierge? (Strike three)Then, after a wonderful night on the town, late into the evening, we had a wonderful nights sleep in a very comfortable bed. Then, it got worse. We were eager to sleep in and enjoy the serenity of the pleasant room and cozy bed, however, at about 8:30 am there was another knock on the door to wake us up (again). Half asleep I went to the door and found the staff member chose to wake us up and let us know there was a newspaper at the foot of the door. Waking guests up at 8:30am to tell you about a newspaper....Absurd! (Strike 4)The fifth and final strike was the worst. It was about 10am that same day. There was a brief knock at the door and then immediately the door flung wide open. This time, a staff member, who never waited for us to answer the door, rudely and ignorantly barged in the room and interrupted &quot;an intimate moment&quot; between me and my girlfriend. Extremely embarassing. We still have no idea why he just barged in the room. We remain shocked, embarassed, and angered by the experience. My girlfriend was extremely embarassed and ran to the bathroom crying. I did call the manager immediately and she was very polite and apologized. My SPG points were also refunded. Three weeks have passed and I am still disappointed in the stay, the staff, and the embarassing experience and this is why I chose to write this review. 5 strikes in one 24 hour period for a property of this caliber is simply unacceptable. This hotels claim of being trendy and sexy is true but the staff is poorly trained and inexperienced which can lead to missing a broadway play , scalping expensive tickets, missing dinner plans, and a crying girlfriend in the bathroom the day before Christmas. My recommendation is to consider the few other major hotels (i.e., Mariott or Double Tree) within a block of the W in Times Square and avoid this property until the staff can be suitably trained on guest relations."
102,1991,"Jan 7 2009 	Excellent night stay	I stayed at the W Times Square for one night on December 17, 2008 and was very happy with the experience. Valet was easy at the entrance on 47th St. (It is $65 (large car/suv) per 24 hours no in/out).Check - in was very quick and we were upgraded to a suite with Times Square views. It had two bathrooms, a wet bar, pull out couch and separate king size bedroom. The mattress was very comfortable as was the room overall. It had dual climate control zones and two enormous LCD tvs. We called housekeeping twice for pillows, etc. and they were brought up in minutes. Our room was on the 20th floor and did not have any problem with road noise - honking cars, etc. So many other reviews mentioned this, but it was not an issue for us. Also, in the lobby there was not loud music playing and it actually had a calm vibe to it during the day. When we returned late that night there were definitely people at the lobby lounge/bar but it still seemed pretty low key. We had an excellent breakfast in the hotel restaurant. The pumpkin ginger pancakes and smoked salmon platter were both great. All of the hotel employees that we encountered were pleasant and helpful - from the valet attendant, to housekeeping, to check-in, to restaurant staff (especially at the restaurant - it was very busy when we came in for breakfast (it was filled primarily with what looked like local businessmen and a few hotel guests), but the restaurant manager (seeing we were hotel guests) was very attentive and made space for us after a few minutes wait)As we were leaving we did notice that they have something called the Acura Experience or something like that. It's hotel sponsored program that provides free rides around the city in an Acura SUV, I think. We definitely would have made use of this if we had known of it. Also, at check in the hotel receptionist knew the pull-out couch would be used, but this must not have been communicated to housekeeping because the pull-out was not set up at turn-down. We had to call for extra blankets and pillows. I know this is minor, but it's so nice when these things are remembered by staff and I'm pleasantly surprised. The rooms were pretty dim and the opaque wall/divider between the bathrooms was a little odd, but other than that I have no complaints. I would definitely return to this property and recommend it strongly."
103,1991,"Jan 6 2009 	absolutely brilliant!!!!!!!!!	I Stayed here for six days over xmas. The staff are fantastic and are all very good looking. The entrance to the hotel is fantastic and the constant chill out music around the place makes you feel like you are staying in a very very trendy place. Every little thing has been thought of down to the best bar design in new york to the rooms with plasma tv and walk in showers and your own cd in your room with fantastic music on. There is also an ipod dock in your room. The rooms are billiant with a very comfortable bed and the best design of any hotel room i have ever seen as it has just been refurbished. all the staff are very friendly and polite and are never ever rude which amazes me as surely some people have an off day !! the huge guy on the door is hilarious and well worth speaking to as he is like a tour guide !! every thing in this hotel is by design. The staff and the way they look, the type of moisturisers in the room to the lightings in the lift everything thing has been thought off !!! it made my holiday this place and was fantastic!!!! the only down side is:1. the food in the blue fin is terrible and the place is dirty.. but you dont really eat there as you will know what i mnean when you arrive2. the millions and millions of people in times square and you get bombarded by people trying to sell you the bus tours outside the hotel about ten metres away so ofcourse every time you go back or go anywhere they ask you again and again !!!lastly the spice village restaurant in the meat packing district is fabulous !!! cool decor and really trendy asian fusion foodand the china grill betwen 5th and 6th but i cant remember what street its on in midtown is superb !!!!! Quality meats is also a good choice for stakes but all of these are very expensive so get ready !!!if you want to go clubbing avoid Mansion or marquee even if the concierge say go there as its rubbish !!! ugly , rude wannabees that have no class ask to go to Brother jimmys on the upper east side or a small boutique club. But you may never leave the hotel bar as it is very very cool, and the hotel across the road is lovely there hotel bar there think its called stage or set!!!enjoy !!!!"
104,1991,"Jan 4 2009 	Awesome!	My wife and I had a great time in New York and the W Hotel was perfect in every way. The room while not spacious was clean, cool gadgets, priced right and a perfect location. The Blue Fin (part of the Hotel) was also great for people watching and a great selection of food. My only complaint maybe a recommendation for a restaurant by the concierge. They recommended a steak house called STK, it was awful! The service was well below par for a restaurant like this and the food was mediocre. However, one restaurant that you might want to try is West Broadway. Its a relatively new restaurant and is geared to organic foods. The service is fantastic, food phenomenal and reasonably priced. For breakfast try the Blue Fin or Stardust diner just up Broadway from the W.Overall I would say our stay at the W was perfect."
105,1991,"Jan 1 2009 	Trendy hip hotel	My wife and I took our mothers to NYC for Christmas and stayed at the W Times Square. The hotel is very trendy and hip and I can say all the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The hotel is a little dark but not so bad you cant see anything. The rooms were good size for NYC, clean and comfortable. The only complaints really were that there is only one drawer in the whole room to store your belongings. There are some open shelves to sit stuff on but sometimes you like your stuff out of sight. The second complaint is the bathroom and lack of privacy. The bathroom is basically a frosted glass enclosure and while you cant exactly see through it you can hear everything through it and it is definitely not exactly private. For married or longtime couples its no big deal but for some it could be uncomfortable with the lack of privacy. Overall it was a great stay and alot of fun, the rooms are clean, modern, great beds and tv's. Oh and the minibar can get expensive so read the details of all the charges before you indulge."
106,1991,"Dec 29 2008	Enjoyed our stay	Me, my wife and our two boys stayed at the W right before Christmas and really enjoyed it. Yes it's dark and everything is very modern but that is the theme of the hotel. If you are looking for warm and elegant stay somewhere else. I did not find anything confusing about staying here. If you don't know where something is, ask or read the guide in your room, duh! Twice, I called the whatever/whenever line and got a response right away!If you are expecting perfection when you stay at a hotel, you will always be disappointed."
107,1991,"Dec 28 2008 	W Hotel Times Square Unaccomadating and Overpriced	My husband and I take a vacation to NYC every Christmas as a romantic getaway. We have always been very fond of Starwood Hotels so we decided to try the &quot;hip and well designed&quot; W Hotel in Times Square. While checking in the staff seemed very attentive but this quickly changed after we got into our room. The room looked like an IKEA showroom with very cheaply made furniture and decor. Most items in the room looked worn and with chips in the glass tables and the toilet paper holder practically falling off the wall. When I attempted to use the restroom we found that the glass sliding door was not attached to the wall in the correct way so we had to have maintenance sent to correct the problem. Then my husband and I attempted to get ready for the night and while blow drying my hair the entire room lost electricity. We immediately called down to have this taken care of and had no electricity or response to our situation for at least 25min. The hotel was also very loud and we found it hard to get a good nights rest while there. It also seemed that the hotel was extremely understaffed for the busiest time of year. There was only one concierge and two bell hops for the entire hotel. Every time we tried to used their &quot;great customer&quot; service ,in which they boast with a catchy marketing phrase &quot;whatever, whenever&quot;, we sat in lines. The hotel is extremely overpriced for what you get. There are many other nicer hotels to chose from in New York. My husband and I would not stay here again. Our stay in the W Times Square actually put stress into our vacation which was supposed to be a Romantic Getaway."
108,1991,"Dec 28 2008 	Not eventful	I had a choice to stay at any hotel near Times Square. I have stayed at the Westin before so I decided to try the W and stayed 3 nights. The W is more for the young professionals not families or seniors. It takes 2 elevator rides to get to your suite.The room I had was modern looking but the windows were really dirty. I understand that window cleaning is not something done frequently but for the room prices they charge, the Hotel should consider cleaning it weekly. It does contribute to the whole stay experience.It also seems that there isn't a lot of staff working. There is only one person at the front desk and I only saw one maid. There is no staff just standing there to offer any assistance. You have to figure out which elevators go which floors or which services are offered [I still do not know if there is a business centre at the hotel].The bed was excellent and the toiletries were the best. The one thing that seems lacking is a coffee maker in the room. I am not sure why other Starwood brand hotels has it and not the W.I didn't get that feeling that it was something special staying at the W."
109,1991,"Dec 20 2008 	great beds	The &quot;W&quot; Hotel is great ,after reading alot of negatives about this hotel,The beds are great,the service is wonderful,the rooms are clean,the doormen are miracle workers,and the staff is very helpful . I am not a cry baby nor do i demand alot of attention but our nyc w hotel times square stay was great.we ordered room service 1 night and it was easy to order over the tv menu and surprise it was hot and delivered fast to our room within 30 min.The W is a wonderful place and i can't wait to return thx w and nyc we had a great time and we will be back soon ,ken w."
110,1991,"Dec 1 2008 	Very impressed!	Just got back from a stay at the 'W' from thanksgiving to sunday 30th november. There were mixed reviews on trip advisor and so i didnt have my hopes up too high but i was very impressed!The main lobby is on the 7th floor and we had no trouble getting lifts up and down (only once did we even share a lift!) - the lobby is very trendy and a bit gloomy really (everything is very dark in this hotel) but it looks good! Hotel staff were very friendly (and the men were really rather good looking haha!). We arrived at 7.30am on thanksgiving morning and although our room was not ready they were happy to take away our bags and the room was ready by 11.00am.We had a spectacular room on the 53rd floor with two double beds and a view towards central park- the room was compact but had everything we needed. The bathrooms are very strange - they have dark frosted walls which you can see silhouttes through once the light is turned on! Was not good on the privacy front and took a while to get used to but we found with the smaller light on you couldnt see quite so much and you didnt feel quite so exposed! not the best design for a bathroom i have come across!Room was quite stuffy and we found we needed the window open to get some fresh air in but then you could hear all the times sq noise but i guess that is to be expected! As for the room the beds were very comfortable but the lighting is terrible - its was really hard to do your make up in the evening and i had to do the make up and check it when i got to a better mirror in the restaurant to make sure it looked ok!We ate breakfast in the restuarant Blue Fin and one lunch - was a little pricey but very nice and a good place to get a table on times square where everywhere else is a wait!Overall i would stay in this hotel again, the location is great, the staff friendly - i would just bring a curtain for the bathroom and some lightbulbs for the room haha!"
111,1991,"Nov 29 2008 	Beautiful Hotel	When making my reservation I requested a newly renovated corner room and upon check in I was granted my requests and later discovered that my room also had a partial view of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which I was planning to see anyway. That was so awesome! I didn't even have to stand in the cold to see Snoopy!! The room was beautiful. The size was average by New York standards, in my opinion. The furniture was brand new, contemporary, and functional. My fiancee LOVED the HDTV, and the king sized bed was amazing! It cradled me to sleep every night in under 10 minutes! I didn't find the stuff snooty by any means. They were all very nice, helpful, and seemed geniuinely happy to work there. I did notice that none of them work name tags, just a little &quot;W&quot; pin on their shirts.We did have one little issue while we were here. I brought back some pizza from my hotel room and called the Whatever/Whenever desk to get a microwave. They said they did not have them available to put in guests rooms, but the young lady said that she could connect me to room service and the could heat it for me. But when I spoke to room service, they said that they do not reheat outside food because it is a health hazard. She said that they will only reheat it if the food came from the hotel. When I asked if they would reheat food cooked by the hotel even if the guest had eaten from it, she said yes. That part threw me off... it's a health hazard if it was prepared outside the hotel and untouched, but not if the hotel prepared it and you've EATEN off of it??? To me, it sounded like someone didn't have their facts straight. Anyway, after going back and forth with the front desk for 10 minutes or so I finally laid in bed and enjoyed my hot New York pizza. Ahhh...After reading a lot of reviews on here, I thought that the place would be so dark that I wouldn't be able to see 2 feet in front of me. I read all this garbage about not being able to see the buttons on the elevator and not being able to navigate around the room after the sun goes down.. Not so for me. I mean, the lobby was a little dim, and the room was maybe a little bit dimmer than your normal room, but not by much. It was nice to me, very relaxing.All in all, I loved this hotel. I'd definitely recommend it, and I'll definitely be back!"
112,1991,"Nov 25 2008 	A great location in the heart of the city!	A very nice hotel choosen for our incentive (group of 102 persons)In the heart of the city of NY, Time square is the soul of theaters and animation.Lights everywhere, noisy but it's part of the location!The hotel is very nice, very design with a vey &quot;people&quot; bar during the evening.The rooms are quiet even with view on Time Square (We were on the 26th floor) and the service is perfect.A place to be despite an expensive rate!!"
113,1991,"Nov 22 2008	Awesome! According to my 9 year old	I wasn't sure what to expect, as I've seen excellent to ugly reviews on this hotel...I was actually very impressed. I have a 9 year old boy with me, and as strange as it sounds, the chic lighting in the bathroom helped him get through the night (as a nightlight to the bathroom). While the view was limited (mostly the Marriott, but you could turn your head and see times square), the room was clean, and while small, just fine, since we were there to tour anyway. Check in clerk had an &quot;upscale attitude&quot;, but check in was efficient for 1pm. Room was not turned when we got there, but he took care of me. Concerige very responsive and helpful for day trips. GREAT location on Times Square...right in the middle of it all. Only thing was there was no minibar menu, and when I asked the Whatever operator, she did not know...so I gambled and a beer was $11. Yikes! Very Hollywood types in lobby bar at night; my son got a kick of it (he LOVED the entry lobby waterfalls in the ceiling!). Housekeeping friendly, efficient, and good; but it is dark in the rooms; you gotta get used to that aspect. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat though; with the kid, or with my partner."
114,1991,"Nov 18 2008 	W Times Square ""The Best""	My husband and I had a reservation for another nearby hotel, we checked in and when we saw the room we checked right out! We had read mixed reviews about the &quot;W&quot; but decided we wanted to stay in Times Square. When we walked in the hotel we were greated by the most wonderful staff. We explained to the manager that we were not happy with the other hotel and would like to see a room at the &quot;W&quot;. She gave us a tour and showed us a beautiful room. We were able to get a great rate through the internet last minute. We stayed four nights and had the best time! The staff at the &quot;W&quot; is incredible, their motto is Whatever- Whenever and they mean it! The rooms are newly renovated and tastefully decorated. They are smaller, but this is New York in Times Square!! I would highly recommend this hotel to any of my friends and hope to stay there again soon!!"
115,1991,"Nov 18 2008 	Cool hotel	My expectations were not high after reading some of the reviews here. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised and wanted to share my experience.This was my first time staying at any W hotel, and the staff made me feel welcome immediately upon arrival. I was concerned that I may not be trendy enough to feel comfortable here, that that was not the case. The check in process was friendly and efficient. Every interaction with the staff was positive, and I did not experience any of the aloof/pretentious behavior others have mentioned.I was a bit surprised, in a good way, but the size of the &quot;Wonderful&quot; room. I was concerned that the lowest room class would feel cramped and claustrophobic, but there was actually plenty of room. This is not to say the room was large (this is still NYC), but I have stayed in other hotel in NYC that were half the size.The room was super clean and comfortable. Despite being newly renovated, the room already showed signs of wear. I suspect they are not using the most durable materials, but this would be expected in an ultra contemporary decor that will probably look outdated and need to be remodeled again in 3-4 years. The room was on the 21st floor, facing north, overlooking Times Square. I will agree with the other reviewers in saying that there are times when street noise makes it way into the room. This is usually police or fire sirens. I work in a NYC highrise, and the noise level is no worse in the hotel. Please understand this is Times Square, so if you are looking for a quiet hotel, this is not it. The staff were attentive and friendly. The TV remote in my room was missing, and within 3 minutes, I had a new one. A few minutes after that, I received a call from the Whatever/Whenever desk to make sure the remote issue was resolved. We ordered room service breakfast one morning, it arrived hot and fresh, but was overpriced. The only thing I would change is the the frosted glass bathroom wall and door. Privacy anyone? Not in this bathroom. Overall, it was a good experience. I got a ridiculously low price through the Internet. I can see how some who pay $500+/night would be put off by the lack of bathroom privacy and the low-quality materials used in the room."
116,1991,"Nov 16 2008 	Fantastic	I had a great room at the W hotel when I went there on business. It was spacious and clean and had a lovely ambient atmosphere. Room service was great as was the Blue Fin bar. Staff were accomodating and friendly. As a matter of fact, i left my purse in a cab and the doorman ran after the cab until he was able to retrieve it......now that's service!I would definitely reccomend this hotel to young New York first timers as it is the center of everything! although, possibly not to everyones tastes...quite young and funky. Very similar to Malmaison in London."
117,1991,"Nov 2 2008 	Not worth the money	Just got back from the W Times Square. The location is good but that is all that is good. It is so dark that after a couple of days you will suffer from SAD 'seasonal affective disorder', with every single light on in the room it is not possible to read or make-up ~ not just a bit dim but DARK. We found the concierge to be snotty to the point of rude ~ he clearly didn't know the slogan WhateverWhenever. Our trip was to celebrate my daughters 18th - I am surprised to see that others received some acknowledgment of their celebration because despite wearing a badge most of the day not one person said 'happy birthday.Our room was small and the beds were nothing special for the money.The en-suite had a glass wall and door leaving nothing visual, auditory or aromatic to the imagination ~ the perfect recipe for holiday retention.Despite requesting a high floor, the 30th floor was not high enough to get away from the street noise. The final part of our stay was spent at The Affinia - where we had a spacious suite for the same money."
118,1991,"Oct 31 2008 	Very excellent stay	I was planning a beautiful experience for my wife, due to her first time in NY. I've chosen the W Times Square because is exactly in the center of Manhattan.When i did the reservation i've asked to the customer care if were possible to have some flowers in the room and they come up with a beautiful idea.Then we arrived in NY and we were at the 46th floor with a beautiful sight seen of the city, and is also excellent during the night, and entering in the room there was an heart shape on the bed and a trail of pedals leading to the bed form the entrance.Was fantastic!!! I really suggest the W times Square Hotel and really suggest to contact the service of Whatever/Whenever if you want to plan something extraordinary.I'd like also to suggest to eat at the Blue Fin Restaurant an excellent sashimi.Adolfo"
119,1991,"Oct 29 2008 	W stands for OW	From the moment of checkin everthing was great! The 41st floor room had a great view over Times Square. The room was like new, very clean and spacious considering it was Times Square. The staff made us feel special and we even received free birthday cake. Would go back tomorrow if we had the funds!"
120,1991,Oct 23 2008	the hottest spot in Town	This is realy a nice and viby hotel. Staf is fab and the rooms are amazing. Specialy the sky line of New York.
121,1991,"Oct 19 2008 	Loved it!	Stayed here in August with co-workers for a few days and it was fantastic. I will admit, rates are a little pricey, but the location was amazing. Right in Time Sq! With the said, you would think to expect a lot of noise, but you could hear a pin drop it was so quiet! I'm not sure what rooms other individuals who have posted reviews stayed in, but we were in one of the newly renovated rooms. Decor was hip and clean, and rooms were small but it is also to be expected of NY. We even saw a few celebs at the Blue Fin downstairs! I would definitely stay here again, but would only recommend this hotel to individuals willing to drop their dollars. Not a place for budget travels."
122,1991,"Oct 9 2008	Overpriced! Rude Staff! But Cool Decor	This is a cool hotel - the decor is cool, one of my favorite restaurants is on the first floor - BLUE FIN (GREAT)...but IT IS OVERPRICED!The rooms are quite small, but still nice. The bathrooms are BADLY DESIGNED! You have no choice but to flood your bathroom. The shower is designed with 1/2 a pane of glass - leaving half of the shower open with a very very small splash to contain the water. Everyone I know who has stayed here FLOODED their bathroom, So Lay Down Towels. FUN FOR 650 A NIGHT, HUH?The front desk staff is RUDE and not helpful when it comes to problems. It has a great location and cool decor...GO ELSWHERE UNLESS YOU SCORE A GOOD DEAL!"
123,1991,"Sep 28 2008 	Not worth it!!!!	This hotel was so overpriced. The room was small, smelt and felt dirty. We had a hole in the closet door, dust and rust on everything metal, the carpet was damp, and the room smelt like cigars and smoke. My fiance and I laughed when we walked in the room. We paid 800 dollars for nothing. The room was so small. Also, breakfast was 24 dollars for an egg omlet. I would rather eat at a local McDonalds. Please, dont waste your money!!!!"
124,1991,"Sep 27 2008 	A budget motel would have been better...!	This W certainly doesn't live up to the usual W reputation! The only attractive thing was the lobby. From there on it was dark (so dark we struggled to find our floor button in the elevators and find stuff in the suitcase in the room!). The service was very average - we waited in the room for over 20 minutes for our bags, then called the concierge to ask where they were to be told the bell boy was on his way. 10 minutes later nothing's arrived so we decided to go into town without waiting for the luggage....only to discover the trolley with our bags still waiting in the lobby!! In the end we took our bags off and took them to our room ourselves - hotel staff saw us do but no one asked any questions or offered any help!We stayed on the 25th floor but it was still so noisy it felt like Times square was inside our room. The hotel should seriously consider changing the windows to proper double glazing.The only nice thing was the Blue Fin restaurant - if you are a fish lover, it's highly recommended.The Whiskey club was fun too, but full of teenagers who were extremely annoying at times."
125,1991,"Sep 19 2008 	Excellent room fun atmosphere but loud in the morning	I stayed at the W for business and when I arrived, was very impressed by the dcor and hip atmosphere.The room was clean with excellent amenities (love the Bliss products, flat-screen, beautiful bathroom with wonderful shower). The bed was beyond comfy!However, the morning was really loud: I know the hotel is in Times Square and so I expected some street-level noise. What I didn't expect was the sound of dishes being collected...at 7 am. And the sound of these dishes breaking. And the sound of a cart being rolled down the hallway. And the sound of construction causing the side of the building to shake and make a loud, repetitive squealing noise.Overall, I high recommend the W for a chic and trendy hotel, in the heart of Times Square with fabulous bars (with comfy seats) but I wish that the mngmt were a little bit more mindful of noise early in the morning."
126,1991,"Sep 11 2008 	Uncomfortable Experience	Dark, dingy, cramped, loud and poorly kept property. Way overpriced. Small cramped rooms overfilled with crappy furniture. Claustrophic dark windy corridors. Three different elevator banks poorly marked, very hard to find, ridiculous layout.Loud club music in lobby - even in check in area. Staff young and offer basic, not exceptional service - especially for these rates.Loud, noisy, dirty intersection in Times Square. Only stay here when all other Time Square hotels are full.What a wasted opportunity! Not up to standard of other W Hotel properties - they need help to figure this mess out!!!!!!"
127,1991,"Sep 8 2008 	overpriced dirty room - bad service	We spent 3 nights on a pay two basis but we would have preferred to have paid more and stayed in another placeOur room and the bathroom was in fact dirty e.g. stains on the coffee table, rust stains on the (wobbling) tiles of the bathroom etc.. We complained twice and the reception indeed took note and sent someone to clean but despite the &quot;extra care&quot; we were told they took, it was not even close to what you'd expect from this type of hotel.Finally, two days after we left we rang them twice because my wife believed she had left her earrings in our room. Their lost&amp;found people told us on both occassions that they would investigate and get back to us....no call...I would not go back again."
128,1991,"Sep 3 2008	Fun!	FUN! Had a Great weekend with 4 Friends and the W helped make it happen! Beautiful views and fun Lobby bar. Rooms are a bit small, but who stays in their room long in NYC anyway??? Look forward to their renovation. I will be back! I don't recomend for a family stay."
129,1991,"Sep 2 2008 	Convenient location	I stayed at the W Times Square for business for one night. Overall, it was a decent stay but not as good as I had expected given the price. The decor is very modern like most W hotels but it almost felt like the hotel was trying to hard with the black walls and doors in the hallways (creepy!) and black comforters. The kaleidoscope in the room for looking out the windows was a nice touch and as always I appreciated the high end linens and down comforter. The bathroom was spacious by New York standards and I loved the Bliss toiletries. I accidentally left a pair of pants (blended in with the black comforters...) and called immediately the day I checked out to see if they could be recovered. Three phone calls after that and I never did get the pants back. :( Disappointing to say the least.Pants and black decor aside, the location is stellar - just off Time Square and convenient to the subway too."
130,1991,"Aug 27 2008 	Very nice and reasonable with their specials	Stayed for a long weekend and found the hotel and staff to both be very good. Staff was very helpful and informative with regard to sightseeing locations, how to get to them, and approximate cost depending on transportation. Room was clean and in great condition with a great view of Times Square. Would highly recommend. Some reviews mention that the rooms were small, but it's NYC and we were able to have 2 adults and 2 children in and did not feel cramped."
131,1991,"Aug 22 2008 	Great Hotel in Times Square	The W Hotel Times Square is in the heart of Times Square in Manhattan. It is very convenient to many Broadway theaters and great restaurants. The hotel is very urban chic, with good friendly service. The rooms are somewhat small, but are cozy and nicely kept. The elevators are fast, which is important for such a high rise. The rates are very reasonable for this quality of a hotel in Manhattan."
132,1991,"Aug 21 2008 	Awful!!!	This is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in. We stopped in New York for 3 nights on our way to the Dominican Republic and stayed at the W Times Square. On the return journey we had booked somewhere else (the Ritz Carlton in Battery Park- wonderful hotel!) And thank god for that! The lobby in the W isn't so bad. It's dark but still rather tastefully decorated. However as soon as we stepped out of the lift on the floor of our room I was horrified. The carpet was dirty, there were no windows and barely any lights so it was terribly dark. The room wasn't much better. The bathroom was filthy and absolutely tiny! Our &quot;city view&quot; room was just a view onto another skyscraper across the road. We had to leave our blinds down the whole time as they could see right into our room. Although the beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean, the cushions on the bed were all stained. I wouldn't recommend staying in this hotel. It's far from the four star it claims to be. I certainly will never be staying here again anyway!"
133,1991,"Aug 15 2008	Stylish	I stayed in the W TImes Square last summer and was impressed as soon as my car pulled up outside. Immediately greeted by the professional but very friendly and helpful doormen. The lobby is incredibly stylish - the sort of place that would feature in a scene of Sex and the City. Secure lifts to guest rooms with a key card needed to gain access to guest floors. Room itself was decent, perhaps a little smaller than I would have liked, but nothing worth complaining about. I wasn't too sure about the bedding material and have to question whether or not style is more important to the hotel than comfort. Whenever I returned to the hotel at the end of the day, the doorman recognised me and always greeted me. After a certain time at night I saw some people being asked on the door for their room keys, which is always good for security. I can see how the hotel could give off a pretentious air as it does bear some resemblance to a New York City nightclub, but hey - you pay for security and I suppose to an extent some exclusivity!Think this is very much a young adults hotel - there is constant music in the lobby and with the lighting around the hotel it feels like being in a club, even in the middle of the day!I really enjoyed my stay here, and loved the style. I look forward to returning here (or I might try out the W in Union Square next time as I am getting very sick of Times Square!)"
134,1991,"Jul 29 2008 	Very cool experience - treated like VIP's	You feel like you're visiting a nightclub when you arrive here and true to form, when you get to the check-in on the 7th floor, there's the W bar about 100 feet behind you. The service was excellent as the atmosphere is very casual but professional - they treat you like they're happy you're staying there. We had a flight cancellation and missed out on stand-by for the next flight home, so obviously we were pretty tired and pissed off by this point - 11pm (10 hours in the airport). The gentlemen at reception realized this and made us feel welcome and relaxed. We didn't have any bags (Delta held on to them) so we had no toiletries with us. Within 5 minutes of getting into our room they had delivered two sealed black paper bags, which were his and her toiletry packs with toothpaste, deodorant, hair products, razors and shaving cream. The room is small but decorated very well - very modern. Sliding door from washroom with frosted glass. Shower needed to be sealed as the water basically poured out through the glass door - had to use 3 towels to mop up. This is located right in Times Square but for the night we stayed there, it didn't feel like it at all. Obviously, walking distance everywhere and restaurants all over the place (chain and others). Would definitely go back here!"
135,1991,"Jul 21 2008 	too dark	I've booked this to be close to Time Square for New Year's Eve (you need to book a restaurant table to get access without standing in the cold for hours). Food in the hotel restaurant was creative and good. The hotel room was surprisingly spacious, but the whole hotel is incredibly dark - some may consider this stylish, but when I have difficulties finding the right button in the elevator, I draw the line. None of the computers in the business center worked, but concierge was very helpful in printing my boarding pass. Overall not a bad hotel, but there are better options nearby."
136,1991,"Jul 18 2008 	Horrible W New York Hotel	Horrible, horrible, horrible. Dark corridors. Dirty carpets, and dirty walls. Noisy very noisy. Can't wait to check out after a night's stay"
137,1991,"Jul 15 2008 	What Happened to the W-It has become a disgusting hellhole	I had stayed at the W Times Square a number of times in the past and really enjoyed it, so when my travel desk told me that they had an excellent rate, I jumped at the chance to return. What a mistake!!!! The hotel has become a disgustingly filthy hell-hole. The halls were always a little dark, but now they are positively cave like and the walls are completely scuffed and the carpet torn and worn. Maybe they keep the lights down so that you do not see all of the dirt. My room was dirty and the bathroom was filthy with mold in all of the grout lines. When I called to asked for a clean room, they told me that my rate was for a &quot;non-renovated room&quot; (knew there was a catch to the rate) and refused since they were fully booked. The wallboard was bubbling up around the bathroom and the carpet was damp and mildewed. When I took a shower, the drain backed up and flooded the carpeted area of the room. At 7:00 the renovation work begins and it sounds like they have a jackhammer on the hall, so do not plan on sleeping in.The health club is closed for renovation and they are squirting noxious perfume around the place to cover the mold and mildew smell.And did I mention that the place was a flthy, disgusting hell-hole?"
138,1991,"Jul 14 2008 	Urban cool but looking tired round the edges	Located right in the centre of Manhattan off of Times Square, The W clearly positions itself as the epitome of cool. Certainly, your welcome experience bears this out - the beautiful water feature as you enter, the stunning lounge area on the 7th floor and the genuine easy going and friendly welcome from the staff (who are, of course, way better dressed than you are.)Beyond the lobby, others have noted that the decor veers toward the dark and the industrial. The corridors in particular are like peculiar black holes; mildly off-putting, but the general calming effect does make some sense - and it's unlikely you'll spend much more than a few seconds in those areas as you're passing through.First impressions of the room itself were positive - if you can get over the fact that the room itself was disappointingly small for the price, but overall, the 'cool' vibe carries through - flatscreen HDTV, glass desk, views over Time Square, mood lighting and so on. The bathroom is well appointed with a great shower and refreshingly, a good set of toiletries, including a decent face wash to clear off all that New York grime. The bed was simply one of the best I've had in a hotel - and it needs to be, with the hustle and bustle of Times Square outside doing their best to keep you awake.Alas, after a short while of being in the room you begin to notice that the shine and gloss wears thin quite rapidly and it's clearly evident that the rooms are in dire need of a major facelift. Wallpaper peels from the corners of walls, dust is collecting on the skirting board, the air vents haven't been cleaned in months. The taps in the bathroom are dull and tarnished; the sink has cracks from years of use. The lamps are yellowing, the cover of your complimentary 'soothing' CD looks like it was found at the bottom of the bargain bin of the Virgin Megastore across the street.In a low key hotel at a cheaper price, you'd probably let these things pass - but in a premium hotel at a very premium rate, the lack of attention to detail was unforgivable. Clearly, the rest of clientle - a mix of fashionistas, media types and &quot;Sex in the City&quot; wannabes - seemed happy enough, but then again, they probably weren't fretting about who was footing the bill."
139,1991,"Jul 12 2008 	W Rocks!	Perfect W experience! Great location, helpful staff, great room!"
140,1991,"Jun 29 2008	One of the hotel features: overbooking	This review will be very short. We were 2 couples and decided to spend a weekend at the W for a birthday event. We get there to check in and the receptionist tell us to come back later because the rooms were not ready yet. We called before coming back and we were told the rooms were clean and the keys were ready.As soon as we got there, they finally tell us they had a computer problem and that all the rooms suddenly happened to be all taken. What a service."
141,1991,Jun 28 2008 	Stay Away!	The room is one of the smallest I have ever seen. They make the Microtel seem spacious. It's hard to pull off the modern contemporary look when the property is so dated. It has that 70's style of &quot;contemporary&quot;. The location is unbeatable. The price is outrageous even by New York standards. The only thing positive I can say is that the Blue Fin restarant was great. Excellent food and great service at reasonable prices.
142,1991,"Jun 25 2008 	Nothing special	We stayed at this hotel in June 2008 for a birthday treat for my 21 year old daughter and 16 year old son. Picked the hotel for the location, right on Times Square and thought my daugter might like the modern space age theme. Booked two rooms intercommunicating. Booked 'spendid rooms' for a treat, on arrival at reception was offered two rooms on the newly renovated 15th floor, so were first guests to stay in them. My son and daughter were highly impressed with the ultra modern decor but for myself and partner we were quite disappointed. The corridors and lift areas have gun-metal grey walls, ceilings and carpets which to begin with looked quite smart but by the 3rd day we felt we were staying in a prison block. The rooms were a reasonable standard hotel size and as previous reviews have stated, the beds were very comfortable. Again the 'grey' theme was repeated throughout the rooms. It felt like the hotel has tried to make it hip and fashionable but failed to make it comfortable. Although the twin room had a very small bath, the king-bed room only had a shower which was a little disappointing. A note on the bathroom, the entire walls are made of glass, and although frosted you can see people inside, therefore absolutely no privacy, which for a couple can just about get by, but for my daughter sharing with her brother was a big no-no. Lots of the room decor and with the hotel in general, has been decorated for show, and has not taken into consideration any practicalities.Another mention is that all 3 mornings we were awoken at 7.30am by loud drilling, so guess the floor is still being worked on, so avoid rooms on the 15th for the next few weeks.A note on the staff, again we felt that everyone was image consicious and not really doing any proper customer service. The consiege was the most UNHELPFUL we had ever come across and we have stayed in New York many times.In all, my daughter loved this hotel which was what the trip was all about, for myself wouldn't stay here again, much prefer the more comfortable Sofitel a couple of blocks away."
143,1991,"Jun 22 2008 	One of the best hotels in Midtown	I was booked in this hotel by Starwood Corporate after my original stay at the Sheraton Manhattan at Times Square went all wrong (see my post there for full details.)Having stayed at many W hotels in the past, this one ranks up with one of the best. The suite I was in was absolutely beautiful. It had a very large bedroom, 2 full bathrooms, living room, two large screen tvs, multiple sound systems... the works. The best part of this room is that it is the only room with a full balcony. It has an amazing view, and is perfect for anyone looking to entertain up to two dozen people comfortably. You are separated from all the other rooms, so you can be sure your partying will not disturb any of your neighbors. Also the balcony comes in handy for those who smoke, as all the rooms are non-smoking.The club in the basement of the hotel is okay, tho never drew a very big crowd. There is a great bar in the main lobby area of the W (3rd floor), and a great place to unwind. The restaurant has some great food (sushi blend), but expect to pay the usual NYC fares. The room service is on par with the restaurant, and can satisfy almost any need at anytime. This goes along with the W's motto: Whatever, Whenever. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in Times Square."
144,1991,"Jun 16 2008 	Needs a facelift	I am originally a New Yorker, so going back and seeing how Times Square has changed in 30 years is great and I Love N.Y. The past few years we stay at the W-Times Square-used to stay at the Paramount now the W. When it opened;WOW.!! This year it just started to seeem like it needed a bit of work. The carpet had small stains, the rooms hadn't changed in at least 3 years, and the bar that we love (BLue Fin ) which has a great corner view jutting out onto Times Square and all enclosed in glass needs to replace the chipped glass chair stools. Honestly I love this hotel, I go every year but would hope Management recognizes it's time for a facelift."
145,1991,"Jun 15 2008 	W Times Square is GREAT!	The main purpose for my trip to NYC was to see &quot;Grease&quot; at the Brooks Atkinson theater, with Taylor Hicks in the role of Teen Angel. After weighing the options (closeness to the theater being foremost), I chose W Times Square. And I am so glad I did! The theater and the hotel are in the same block.This is a very hip place to stay, located in Midtown and the Theater District. Though the hotel and most of the nice eateries around it are pricey, it was worth it.Also, it is convenient for sightseeing via the hop-off/hop-on double-decker bus tours - there's a stop right around the corner from the hotel, by the Roxy Deli (the size of those sandwiches!).The W staff was fantastic. My room was quite comfy. As I mentioned, it's a &quot;hip&quot; hotel - mostly a young crowd, so the &quot;living room&quot; (the lobby) was a bit noisy -- but all of NYC is noisy!I really enjoyed my stay, and I look forward to going back."
146,1991,"Jun 4 2008	W 4 me!	Have just returned from a long weekend at this hotel, and what a fab time we had. The hotel is situated right in the hub of Times Square. Thought the noise would have been a problem but as we were on the 25th floor and facing one of the side streets, this was unfounded. The room was a twin room with two double beds and an ensuite bathroom. It was a fair size for two people and I could have lived with it longer, if I had the chance!! Fresh towels were provided daily and the bar was stocked well, if a tad expensive. The bliss products in the bathroom were replenished daily and were brilliant. The staff were excellent, friendly and courteous at all times. The bar was a bit expensive although very chic so we preferred the bars out on the square and surrounding areas. Only ever ate breakfast in the hotel and it was okay, plenty of it. We would return to this hotel again as we loved it, the location and the big comfortable beds......."
147,1991,"May 29 2008 	Great Hotel	I've just recently come back from a 3 night stay in New York. I took the trip with my wife as a birthday present.I visited New York about 7 years ago and always vowed to go back. The recent bank holiday seemed like the perfect excuse. The first thing i noticed when booking the trip was how expensive the hotels had become in New York. Most hotels seemed to be around the 200 a night mark. I looked at a few 'cheaper' hotels and they were still around 150, so i thought, go on treat yourself, book a nice hotel. So after much deliberation i booked the W hotel in Times Square.After reading a couple of reviews i was a little appehensive. I was led to believe that the hotel was pitch black with techno music booming out until your ears bled ! This was not the case.When you arrive at the hotel the first thing that will strike you is how close you are to the centre of Times Square. You are literally bang smack in the middle. There are several bars outside the hotel, as well as deli's and other eateries. The hotel is also a short walk from the Times Square Subway stop.You enter the hotel in the basement and have to take a short lift to the 7th floor. The 7th floor being the reception / living area of the hotel. As you enter the basement the word ambient springs to mind. Dashes of purple light and ceiling mounted water features. A nice little touch with regard to entering the basement is that the hotel employ security during the evening to make sure that only hotel guests can enter.The reception area of the hotel is something else. I totally understand that it will not be everyones come of tea but i personally thought it was fantastic. It's very dimly lit and the tradition of purple light and ambient colours are reproduced. Music seemed to play 24 hours a day whilst we were there. The best genre to describe it would be ambient beach music. I personally quite liked it. And it wasn't as loud as some reviewers have suggested.There is a bar in the reception area and several seating options. The atmosphere was laid back and friendly. The bar staff are excellent.Also within the same room is the concierge. I generally don't bother the concierge as they are normally quite unapproachable. Not so in this hotel. As you walk to the desk you are greeted with a plaque that says 'Whatever'. This pretty much sums up their attitude. And over the course of our stay i bombarded them with pretty much whatever came to mind. Each time they obliged. From producing a plaster for my wifes foot, booking dinner reservations to booking a helicopter trip. They were fantastic.The lifts to the rooms are split into 2 sections. One for the lower rooms and one for the higher floor rooms. We were given a room on the 48th floor. Wow, the room was great. I had read stories that the rooms are small and unpractical. Totally untrue. The shower is a walk in affair and their plenty of room in the bathroom. The bed was fantastic as were the nice touches that surrounded it. You will also get a plasma tv, alarm/radio and several other hotel standards. One thing i must mention are the bliss bathroom products. Easily the best quality hotel bathroom produce i have come across. I am still using the body butter now, but thats another story !In summary, the hotel is great. The staff were generally quite young but incredibly friendly and approachable. The location is great and is pretty much bang in the centre of town.I enjoyed the bar in the hotel but did not use the Whisky bar which is lcoated underneath the hotel. However, i was told that if you produced your hotel card on the door you would receive some form of VIP treatment. Also, i did not use the Blue fin restaurant but did hear good reviews whilst in the hotel.One great recomendation i received from the concierge is worth a mention. A breakfast eatery called the brooklyn diner which is nearby. If you want authentic New York complete with waffles, pancakes etc.. Thats your placeTotally won over by this placeLyndon"
148,1991,May 25 2008 	chi chi hotel with a great location	I am a little old for this brand of hotels but have stayed at this w a few times recently. GREAT LOCATION! GREAT FOOD! You take the elevator up to reception which is a few floors up from the ground. Check in is usually pretty crowded. The on site places to eat are some of the best in area which is packed with hotels because of the theatre district as well as midtown location. Rooms are on the small side but very well designed and comfortable. The hallways are too dark for my taste but it seems to be part of what w defines as cool. Not a lot of benefits for business travelers but the hotel clearly targets young professionals with its bar scene. they have dvd's for borrowing as well as a diverse and tasty room service menu. All in all a nice and comfortable place
149,1991,"May 19 2008	It's Alright	I only live a few minutes away from Times Square and every now and then I will go online and check for hotel bargins. The W comes up often. So my girlfriend and I will check in and be tourists for the night. It's always fun.I like this W but I will pass along some tips. First it is noisy. Expect to hear a drunk or two in the hallway. Second if you have a corner room facing Times Square it will be bright. The hotel needs to install blackout shades badly. Thirdly, it is not as happening as it was a few years ago. The class of people seems to be going downhill quickly. It went from supermodels to baseball capped punks with their girlfriends overnight. ( The W is building in Hoboken. That either means Hoboken is cooler than I thought or that the W is not the brand it used to be).The positives about this hotel? It still has great Time Square views. The staff is still good. The rooms are still cool."
150,1991,"May 18 2008 	Fun Place to Be	I have stayed at the hotel twice - once on pleasure for 5 nights over Thanksgiving in 2007 and once with business for 3 nights in March 2008. My wife travelled with me on both trips and absolutely loved the hotel. The rooms are not large, but I only have the rooms in Asia as a comparison, so they could be large by New York standards. They are equiped with shower, great Bliss tolietries (which are one of the reasons my wife loved the hotel - she has been dedicated to their products ever since), coffee machine and probably the best in-house movie system I have come across. This is great if you want to chill out at night with the Mrs. The mini-bar is expensive but as you leave the hotel on the left hand side is a deli which can serve you breakfast, beer, evening meal or whatever you want, so to be honest we never had to use the mini-bar, if I wanted a drink in the room I just brought up a couple of beers on the way in.As other reviewers have said the lobby area does become a bit of a club/bar at night but this is part of the appeal of the hotel. You have to use the elevator to reach reception and the lobby bar is basically in an open-plan area by reception. There are no windows to the outside so you may feel that you are drinking at 1am when actually it is only 10pm outside. The waitresses are HOT! It is not cheap but not outrageously priced either.The gym is quite small but functional. We ate in the sushi bar on the groundfloor and it was excellent, the bar at the front of the hotel does an excellent seafood platter and combine this with a nice bottle of Sauvignon-Blanc or two and your afternoon is just about full, (as are you). The staff are quite young and very helpful. Friendly, informative and they seem to be genuinely interested in you as a customer. At no point did I feel obliged to tip, to be honest it was a pleasure to do so. The elevators are operated by key-card so security is good.I am one of those people who has to have a window open at night, New York is noisy so if this is you be prepared. If the window was closed the noise was negligent. The hotel is on Times Square which is bright but the blinds on the windows are good. As you would expect there is a good selection of bars and restaurants in the area but the best we tried was Budda Bar in the Meat-Packing District, (take a taxi), it was unbelievable. We also had a great meal in Grand Central Station, I'm sorry but I can't remember the name of the place - its looking over the main concourse.Overall, if you are looking for place to stay as a tourist then I would recommend the hotel. If you are looking for a hotel with large public areas then you may want to try one of the Grand-Dame NYC hotels but you may pay a high price. I would certainly recommend the W Hotel and hope to go back some day."
151,1991,"May 14 2008 	Great classy place	My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon for 5 nights and absolutely loved the W. It's a great classy place to stay. We had a corner room with views of the Hudson and uptown. Slightly small rooms, not unlike any other New York hotel. Room was always clean. Room service breakfast had amazing Belgian waffles and we got a free bottle of champagne complements of the staff for our honeymoon."
152,1991,"May 12 2008	Times Square in my room	&quot;The hallways are so dark, I feel like I'm going to be mugged.&quot; That's a direct quote from my manager and it surely applies at all W's where I've stayed. Aside from that, the rooms are typical W - although they have this sliding bathroom panel, which seemed flimsy. What happened to having a bathroom door?If you stay at this particular hotel, BE SURE to request a room that does not border on the times square movie screens, unless that is the sort of experience you are looking for. Kids might think this is really cool. As I was there for business, all i kept thinking was that time's square was coming into my room and the blinds surely were not keeping it out.I had my jeans sent for valet laundry and the order was incorrectly completed. They promptly took care of it at no charge by 7am the next day. The hotel staff here are great - every single employee I encountered was kind and courteous. and the gym is nice and usable.A good place to stay in Times Square - and I would recommend this hotel over the Westin."
153,1991,"May 11 2008 	Aging Fast	The W Times Square has a great location if you're in the city for theater. Other than that, there are problems... This was my second stay at this property, but the first since 2004. The entry to the hotel is on 47th street, and is only an elevator lobby that takes you up to 7 which is the main lobby (or Living Room) as W likes to say. During the daytime, the lobby is a nice enough space with check in located off in an alcove. At night, the lobby turns into a nightclub. A source of revenue for the hotel - but very limiting to the paying guests who have no public area within the hotel to gather or relax outside of the room.There is also the Whiskey Bar separate from the Lobby on street level (part of Blue Fin Restaurant, I think), but the W feels they also need to turn the lobby into a nightclub as well. It seeems to work for them as it was packed and loud every night. For the hotel guests, it was annoying.The rooms are small and with exception of those ending in 10 or 11, have very limited views (facing either Marriott Marquis or an office building). Rooms ending in 10 &amp; 11 face Broadway north toward Central Park, and if you are on a higher floor, you may even have a Park view. Actually, the rooms ending in 11 seem to have a larger floorplan with a sitting area. There are only 10 rooms per floors with 57 being the highest floor.What I noticed on this visit was how the rooms have aged - not very well. I didn't find them to be dirty, as I had read in previous reviews. Everything was nice &amp; clean. But they did seem very dated. The W is marketed as a trendy, boutique hotel. And they also try to sell a luxury image. I found this hotel failing both categories. The furnishings in the room were pretty beaten up, and just seemed cheap. The 'chair' they use is a white leather-like cube with no arms. Basically, it's an ottoman sitting in the corner with absolutely no function as a chair for lounging. You can physically sit on it, but not for long as it is just not comfortable. Which leaves the bed as the only place in the room to sit. If this were a less expensive property, that would be one thing. But the prices are quite high and this hotel participates in several luxury hotel collections (Amex Fine Hotels being one), which indicates a certain level of luxury and services. With that in mind, I have rated this property with only 3 stars.I'll list a few positives and negatives that stood out:The Good (in addition to location):+ Bell Staff were very attentive and seemed genuinely interested in guest service+ Nice flat panel TV's with nice range of channels (though only a very few were HD)+ A good deli next door, which proved necessary as the Blue Fin restaurant only opened for limited hours. It had good selection of food and reasonable pricing+ Comfortable BedThe Bad:- Rooms were small &amp; furnishings were greatly lacking- Very small bathrooms- Lots of noise coming from hallways into the room (seemed like much of it was hotel staff servicing rooms during the day)- No climate control in the rooms (Forget the thermostat on the wall)- Limited usable public space and restaurant choiceSUMMARY - Great location for theater and a nice, comfortable bed for sleeping. Not especially trendy, aging fast."
154,1991,"May 11 2008 	A 'W'onderful Stay :)	I took my Mother to New York for a weekend for her 50th Birthday and I really wanted to splash out and stay somewhere very nice and with a good location, and The W was just that!The staff couldn't have been any nicer and wished my Mother a happy birthday apon checking in. Later that night they even sent up a piece of birthday cake and a card. That was the icing on the cake for her. (no pun intended :P)We were on the 46th floor ( In the 'Spectacular room) with a view down onto Times Square, the noise wasn't bad at all since we were so high up, and the room had blackout drapes so all the blinking lights and lit up signs didn't bother us during the night.The beds were oh-so-comfy, and we loved the music that was always playing in our room.We ordered room service for breakfast on both of the days and it was delicious! So well prepared and presented. A real treat :)The check in lounge on the 7th floor was fab, always someone around to help us with our luggage, or questions about the city or simply getting us a cab. (Which can sometimes be a hassle downtown)Anyway! The W was a wonderful choice and we can't wait to have another girls weekend and go back sometime soon :)"
155,1991,"May 10 2008 	Good hotel despite where it is	I confess: I hate Times Square. It's over-rated and it's impossible to move without falling over particularly dim tourists. I only stayed there because it was convenient for the meetings I was having, and I generally like the Starwood chain for decent hotels and relatively reasonable prices.But The W is actually pretty good. I'm (just) 50 but I liked its modernity and it's well-designed. The rooms aren't particularly big but they're nicely laid-out; and the staff are generally friendly and welcoming.The $8 bottle of water at bedside is one of the less good ideas and they deserve to lose a rating point for that alone, and people who don't like big cities may have found the neon creeping through the blinds at night a bit of a distraction.But generally I liked the corner room I was given --- view of the tacky Square on one side, and the Hudson out to the west --- and I found the food at Breakfast good though certainly not cheap.Overall it was above expectations, and I'd go back on a business trip - though for a vacation I might head either north or south for a touch more civilisation on the doorstep."
156,1991,"May 8 2008 	Nice enough.	First off, I'm not a huge fan of the whole W concept so I may tend to have a negative bias. The negatives first:This hotel tries SO HARD to be hip that it's almost laughable. However, I don't think people who are really hip would ever actually stay in a Times Square hotel. Much less a hotel that is only moderate to high priced by NYC standards. Browsing the gift shop is kind of a giveaway too. Pretty low-end merchandise.The room we had was quite small and the bath room was tiny. The bathroom had a sliding door with a frosted glass panel. It served a dual purpose of seeming hip, while helping to mitigate the tightness of the bathroom. Supposedly our room was an upgrade (and it was a corner room) so the regular rooms must be even smaller. The room was nicely furnished except for some random, cheap-looking throw pillows.Almost all the surfaces in the public areas are black or charcoal gray. This color scheme, combined with the cheesy mood lighting makes it difficult to see. It's annoying, but the W in Murray Hill is even worse as far as that goes (and not as nice in other ways, too). I agree with the other reviewer who said that the bathroom wasn't as maintained as it should have been. If I'm going to have a room that small I want it to be a jewel box. The lobby is an elevator ride up from the front entrance. Then you go to a separate elevator bank to get up to your room. The floors are mislabeled, so that it seems as though you are on a higher floor than you really are. This is only a minor inconvenience.The positives:We had a pretty nice view. The Bliss products that they stock the room with are nice.There is a restaurant right off the front entrance area that is supposed to be pretty fun.There was a pretty long line at check-in and it was handled really, really well. It went quite quickly and the desk staff was friendly and efficient. The bellhops were terrific. Friendly and fast. The concierge was nice, but not all that helpful. He didn't have knowledge of our requests so it was frustrating to watch him surf the internet slower than I could have. However, our requests were probably not standard and we were in a rush, so I can't really fault him. He did the best he could. Housekeeping was also very friendly. Quiet in the halls and they would immediately push the elevator button for you if they saw you coming. A little thing, but evidence of training.Overall, it was a small, dark hotel with trendy decor that only partially distracts from it's shortcomings (lipstick on a pig). But it has a surprisingly nice and professional staff. I would not be disappointed to go back for a short trip."
157,1991,"Apr 29 2008 	Hip Hotel in the thick of Times Square	We booked a king room on the 53rd floor. The rate with tax was $452 per night.We arrived at 1pm. The lobby was chaotic. It was difficult to tell where the line began. After waiting 20 minutes we left and returned to try again around 4:30. Things were moving much more quickly and smoothly then. Check in took less than 10 minutes on our second attempt.If you arrive before 3:30pm I recommend leaving your bags, going about your business and returning in the late afternoon.There is wireless and wired internet in the rooms. It is $16.95 per day.The rooms are small, as expected, and attractively modern and minimalistic. The bathroom has little space for toiletries so a hanging bathroom bag would come in handy. The toilet offers little privacy as the walls and door are translucent glass.There was a hair dryer, iron and ironing board in the room. The mini bar was well stocked with Heineken, wine, booze and more. From the W 1567 Broadway (47th and Broadway) you can walk to the theaters, great restaurants, 7th Ave shopping, MOMA and more. It is as good of a location as you can find. The hotel has a lobby bar with very attractive bar tenders that gets quite lively and a separate club bar called Whiskey that was packed.If you are looking for some real New York nightlife within walking distance try Touch. Clubs come and go but this place was it in April of 08. It is a short walk from the hotel at 240 W. 52nd. Ask the concierge for a complementary admission (don't forget to tip). That card will not only get you in free, it might be the only way to get in on a busy night. The crowd is young and energetic. The DJ gets everyone dancing early. This club was already very busy when we arrived at 11:30pm.This W Hotel isn't nearly as accommodating as the Four Seasons but the location is better. The Marquis has a slightly better location than the W but is a half star below in my opinion."
158,1991,"Apr 24 2008 	Too hip for its own good	This is a hip, contemporary hotel in a great location. It is not terribly user friendly. The elevators are dark, and almost all guests (comedically) search for the button to their floor. The lobby/lounge is so noisy and dark (again) that you can't really hear or see. There's public internet access during the day that disappears once the bar starts going. It's a great place to hang out and people watch, though. The food is generally very good, and the bar is overpriced and the service indifferent, but you still don't mind because the crowd is so interesting. The front desk staff is very good and friendly. The wait staff feels like they're doing you a favor by waiting on you. The room I had was spacious and comfortable. My colleague was not so lucky with a cramped and musky room. Expensive, hip, attitudinal. It's a fine place to stay in Times Square, but I'd suggest other parts of the city if you want a better hotel."
159,1991,"Apr 23 2008 	More Style than Comfort	The W hotel has a great location in Times Square and is hip and stylish, but when my daughter and I stayed there for a shopping and Broadway weekend, we weren't that wowed. First of all, the bathroom was not all that clean, especially on the floor, around the tub, and in all the corners. When you're going to have a white bathroom, it better be clean. We also didn't like the design of the bathroom, which was walled off by white, plastic translucent walls that are far from light- or sound-proof, which creates a lack of privacy as well as a problem if someone is trying to use the bathroom while others are sleeping. I think they were going for some kind of modern look, but I'd far prefer standard, sound-proofed walls! In the sleeping area, many things seemed grimy, dusty, or sticky, including the phones, tables, remote controls and radio. I don't think any of these items had been wiped down for quite some time.  The room was quite small, but I would expect that in Times Square.  I booked on hotels.com, and paid extra to be put on a higher floor, but didn't get that. The front desk said I needed proof that I had paid extra and hotel.com's receipt is suspicously vague on details, so I had no recourse on this matter. Traffic noise is definitely a problem unless you are on one of the top floors. As to the amenities outside of the room. There is only one lounge area, and it is basically a bar. Not family friendly, and not comfortable if you want to hang out or wait for someone. Also, there was not always a doorman, and on the day we checked out there was no one to help open the door (our hands were full) or to help us flag a cab. All in all, it didn't seem like a very friendly or helpful place, especially to families."
160,1991,"Apr 23 2008 	Very so-so	To be fair - all of the hotels in Times Square (and NYC generally) are massively overpriced and not very nice. The W is no exception. Location is excellent - right in the heart of Times Square...however, the rooms are small, in desperate need of fine touches, the bathroom is old and not very clean and the water pressure is horrible. Internect connectivity is so slow its almost useless.On the upside - the staff is competent if a bit lacking in polish and the bar area of the lobby is a great place to meet people and hang out with your friends."
161,1991,"Apr 21 2008 	Good hotel	Good hotel for Times Square. Check in was quick, employees were friendly, room was clean, bed was comfortable and the view west was great.Little advice about the bed. What appears to be a padded head board is actually two removable pillows. We didn't realize this until like 2 in the morning when our feet would hang off the bed. So if you think the beds are short they aren't, the head board pillows take up 5 inches of the length of the bed.Second thing, the bottle of water beside the bed has a label on the top &quot;This bottle is provided as a service to our guest. If the consumed a charge will be billed to your room. For your convenience our staff will refresh daily.&quot; The bottle of water is $8.00 bucks. [Side note, I have worked in the hotel industry before... sometimes these bottles will have been in the room for months before they are replaced. Unless the bottle of water is complimentary I would suggest not to drink it.] Other than that it was a good stay."
162,1991,"Apr 9 2008 	Stylish Overpriced Hotel in Great Location	My husband traveled to NYC for work and this was the hotel that was booked for him. I'm glad that we did not pay for this hotel otherwise I would have felt that we overpaid at $400+ per night. Overall, it was a comfortable place to stay in an excellent location in Times Square and close to all the theaters. But I would not book this hotel for a personal stay.While I'm sure the hotel room was excellent at one point, our room, especially our bathroom, was a little dingy. The grout lines of the bathroom tile could use some extra scrubbing. The bathroom was small and there was barely any counterspace, which, many ladies will agree with me, makes it a little inconvenient to get ready in the morning.The hotel is very stylish and trendy, with a great restaurant attached. The bed was ultra comfortable, with a soft pillowtop that made it easy to sink into. The bed was the best thing about the room. This is a good hotel but at the price they charge, it should a GREAT hotel."
163,1991,"Mar 31 2008	Fun and funky	We stayed for a company event and were thrilled to stay in such a nice place. We had a corner room (2501) with a great view overlooking Times Square. The room was good sized and clean, though there did seem to be hair product or lotion or something on the bathroom sink. The bed was great, very comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful enough. The hotel is very secure, you had to use your door key to go anywhere in the elevator and there were lots of staff around. We had a great time at the dance club Whiskey, located beneath the hotel.Though trendy and modern, the place IS dark. The elevators and hallways were incredibly dim. The shower and toilet were pretty noisy when used, but we didn't really hear noise from the rooms around us. The only real issue we had with our stay was discovering a rattle in our car exhaust that wasn't present when we left the car with the valet service.We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to others."
164,1991,"Mar 27 2008 	Fan-Tas-Tic	Brilliant location, excellent view from the rooms. We loved the design and the lobby lounge. Staff is very friendly, breakfast great. Especially the door team is great!Rooms small, especially the bathrooms but very well designed, nothing is missing, w had a great time!"
165,1991,Mar 24 2008 	Very Trendy But Very Small Rooms. Older People (45+) Do Not Go Here	this was located in a great area. just walking distance from the center of times square. i really liked the location. i did not like how the hotel was so dark all the time. i especially didnt like howsmall the rooms were. the bathroom was 3x3 and the bads were super small.. I do not recommend this for older adults. i would highly recommend for 21-35 year olds. nice furniture
166,1991,"Mar 24 2008	Dark but funky!	Conde Nast Traveller magazine UK edition April 2008 (page 44) gives a description of a hip New York hotel that is so dark the reviewer cannot find a thing. I'm fairly certain he was describing the W Times Square. The walls are all black, and the lift buttons are extremely difficult to see. If you suffer from poor vision, looking for a family hotel or are just plain old, you should probably give this a miss.Luckily my wife and I have excellent vision and are under 40, and we had a great time. The W is achingly hip and makes no apologies for it. The main lobby has a huge stylish bar filled with the young and beautiful of New York which made it quite noisy on the Friday eve we arrived, but I prefer to think of it as full of life. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming. We were booked into the 'Wonderful' Room which is their smallest, but they put us into a corner room with great views, and provided complementary cheeseboard and wine. The room was quite small, but in the middle of New York I had no other expectations, neither was it particularly noisy even with the window open. Seriously, I don't understand people who complain about outdoor noise and lights. You are in Times Square, for crying out loud. You don't like noise, stay out of the city, it's as simple as that.I would point out that clothes hooks in the bathroom were seriously lacking, and the bathrooms could do with a touch-up, but nothing deal-breaking.The location is unbeatable, the metro is right across the street and the half-price theatre ticket booth is just around the corner. The concierges are friendly and informative, pointing us toward the best restaurants and bars in the area. There are 2 convenience stores within a 5-second walk of the front door so you can stock up on treats and drinks, rather than the high-price minibar goods. BTW the tapwater is perfectly drinkable, for all those bottled water snobs out there.Later during the stay we moved up to one of the suites on the 53rd floor, fantastic views from here, nothing rivals the Manhattan skyline at sunrise from a King-size bed!We had breakfast at the Blue Fin restaurant twice and it was excellent both times. Much pricier than the nearby deli, but you get what you pay for.We paid about 175 per night and I would definitely check in here again, in fact I'm very keen on checking out other W hotels in the future.Special thanks go to Walter at the front desk for his good cheer and top-class service, and Dana in the Spa for a great massage. In the end, it's the staff that make the hotel wherever you are, and I have no hesitation in recommending the W. Unless you are allergic to black paint, that is."
167,1991,"Mar 22 2008 	Great Place To Stay !!	I just returned from a three day stay at the W in Times Square and having nothing but nice things to say. From the moment we got out of the cab, we were treated with respect and the staff was very friendly. We arrived several hours early and the room wasn't ready. So the hotel stored our luggage for us and we went out sightseeing. They gave us a call when the room was ready. The hotel is in a fantastic location in Times Square. The staff had great reccomendations for sightseeing and how to get to our destination. Yes, it's a little dark, yes it's the hip place to be, but I don't know what the big fuss is about. Did you come to NYC to see the sights and sounds or to spend 99.9% of your time stashed away in your room? We had everything we needed in our room; two double beds, frig, bathtub, tv, ironing board, etc...So if you're looking for a place to stay where you can literally step out the door and you're in the middle of Times Sq, this is the place to be. If you want to stay in your room 24/7 and miss all the excitement and everything that NYC stands for...well I don't know where to send you, because I wouldn't stay in a place like that. But if you really want to stay locked up...I'm sure they'll let YOU stay too."
168,1991,"Mar 19 2008 	W times square stands for Wonderful !!!!!!!	March 16, 2008Just returned from New York city, to see a broadway show and other attractions, this hotel was fabulous, great location, The hotel staff were fantastic, the hotel is very modern. The room was spotless and a decent size. we had two double and were very comfortable. We were in walking distance to every where we wanted to go. By best friend and her daughter who is fourteen and my daugher who is 13 years old absolutely loved it here and had a great weekend that they will always remember.!!!!!! ."
169,1991,Mar 17 2008 	lots of style not much substance	Lighting too dark - even could not read the lift numbers to get to our room. Room was small and dingy (all grey and monochrome). No bath only shower in the room we had. Hardly any space in bathroom for toiletries. Not much space to hang clothes.NO TEA OR COFFE SERVICE IN ROOM and BREAKFAST NOT INCLUDED in our v. expensive room rate.Room service charged ridiculous prices for delivery to room then we had to tip the delivery person as well. All US taxes add a big amount to what you see and what you actually have to pay over. This hotel looked fabulous but the small details let it down. we stayed 3 nights and on our first morning were woken by bedside alarm clock (set by previous occupant) for 5.30 am (we could not find any instructions to turn it off so evenutally had to move bed to unplug it!) .. Very thoughtless of staff not to cancel this sort of thing given they pride themselves on doing whatever / whenever! Ordered room service pizza one night which was DREADFUL - really bad that you can't get a decent pizza esp in New York - we did complain and they (begrudgingly) refunded our account for the value of it but not the point as it spoiled our night
170,1991,"Mar 11 2008	Don't Waste Your Money!!!!!	Do not waste your money saying here. I am a travel agent and have been to New York City on many occasions. I normally stay at the Crowne Plaza Times or Marriott Marquis; however, I wanted to try something different. At check-in everything was fine until we headed up to our hotel room. As I entered the room, the vast space portrayed by images on the hotel's website were merely an illusion. The rooms were very small. The Crowne Plaza and Marriott have much more hotel space and are just as expensive as the W. The staff was rude and the bathrooms were dirty. I complained about the situation at hand and the staff correctly moved me into another room. Although this new room was just as dirty. Neither would I book any of my clients here nor would I ever return to that hotel. Trust me, if you stay here you will be VERY disappointed. Please, do not waste your money on this hotel!!!"
171,1991,"Mar 10 2008 	Perfect hotel perfect location	I stayed at the W hotel for our anniversary. We were greeted in the pouring rain by one of the valets carrying an umbrella who helped us with our bags which was not easy. We were directed to go to the Lobby which is on the 7th floor. Check in was quick and we were able to get in our room right away. The room is a decent size with Bliss Spa amenities, flat screen, view of Times Square (blackout curtains so you can sleep at night) and a very comfortable bed. We went to the Lobby Bar for a drink and Blue Fin to grab lunch. Service was amazing and friendly. The location is perfect for shopping, going to the theater or just about anything. The only thing I have to complain about which is very minor, but how about updating the hair dryers! :) I would suggest bringing your own. Overall a fantastic stay. I think I found my new home when I stay in NY!"
172,1991,"Mar 7 2008 	Would NOT Rec. This Hotel	Stayed @ the W Times square while working at a convention. The staff was wonderful and the hotel was awful. The lobby is very sophisticated, impressive though pretentious. The walls are black throughout the hotel - even in the bathroom. Very difficult to see. The hotel did not have individual thermostat controls in the rooms and we were on the 40th floor - we could barely breathe it was so hot and if you opened the window at all you couldn't sleep due to the Times Square noise that &quot;never sleeps&quot; - either did we. It was dingy and dirty. Like trying to sleep in a night club - the outside lights were disco all night long. We had an engineer tape the blinds down to block the light, gave us a humidifier and a fan and still it was unbearably hot and dry in the room. The midtown holiday inn is actually better than this hyped hip hotel!"
173,1991,"Feb 23 2008 	Fantastic Hotel!	I originally wanted to stay at the Westin Times Square but due to a sudden price increase looked elsewhere. I had read some pretty mixed reviews about the W Times Square but how wrong they were.We arrived at the hotel November 15th 2007, around 1:30pm and were greeted from the moment we stepped out of the cab; asked if we wanted our bags seen to which I declined and were told that the check-in lobby was in the 7th floor (I think!) how anyone can not know this is beyond me considering it tells you in the elevator! The downstairs and check-in lobby are beautifully decorated, upstairs had a nice atmosphere and there was someone at each check-in point for which we waited only waited a few minutes. Asked why we were in NY etc I told him it was my girlfriends birthday and were given a corner room on the top floor of the hotel with great views and offered a bottle of champagne.The room itself is very modern, was clean and everything in working order, the bed was amazing and didn't want to leave. Minibar is a ripoff but what hotel isn't?We ate in the Blue Fin restaurant downstairs for both breakfast and dinner and both the food and service was fantastic. Only went in the lobby bar once just because we spent most nights out and about or were too tired, it was quite lively but not overally so and had no problems then or any other night with the atmosphere or outsiders.On check-out I filled in the quick form and left our bags with the desk while we spent the rest of the day out, on return out bags were promptly returned and we left the hotel in a taxi treated as well as when we arrived.Although perhaps slightly geared towards younger couples of singles we saw plenty of mixed age groups including families with children, overall we had a great time and would definatley stay again."
174,1991,Feb 20 2008	W is for What a rip off	Stayed there for business. Lobby is on the 7th floor and the rooms are TINY and not very clean. For $369 plus tax they had the courtesy to charge $8 for a bottle of water. A rip off even for Manhattan standards.
175,1991,"Feb 19 2008 	Contemporary design but outdated building	My wife and I recently spent three evenings at the W Hotel Times Square in New York. We are frequent travelers who prefer upscale hotels with excellent amenities. Having stayed at several W Hotels before (including another W Hotel in New York), we were excited about our upcoming stay. Our rate was approximately $400 per night but included a bonus third night free.The hotel is in an excellent location in the heart of Times Square. The check-in service was quick, though it can be a bit like trying to order a drink in a crowded club (the desk is located just across from the hotels very active bar). You also begin to notice how dark everything is, including the lobbies and the elevators; if you are a person who craves sunlight, your time here will not be pleasant. Once in the room I found it to be an acceptable size (based on NYC standards) and nicely finished. The furniture is contemporary and sleek with a touch of wow factor. The bathroom is well done but lacks privacy. Only a thin plastic wall and matching door separate it from the rest of the room, offering little barrier to light and sounds. Also, the bed used is a far cry from the Heavenly Bed used in other Starwood offerings, offering a surface far below most pillow top mattresses.One item that came to be an issue during my stay was the temperature and ventilation control for the room. Ive read other mentions of problems here on the site and it seems to not be an isolated issue. You may have no problems at all in your room, or you may find yourself in a mini-sauna for the durations of your visit its a gamble. Another issue this hotel does its best to deal with (and gets mixed results for) is the noise level. Double-pane windows keep much of the city noise out, but thin doors mean that you will hear the neighbors as they come and go. Mixed reviews also have to go to the hotel staff. Nice touches abound (such as cupcakes and hot chocolate at the front desk) but a lack of willingness/ helpfulness in addressing problems result in low overall marks for service.After staying in some excellent W Hotel/Starwood properties, as well as some other good NYC hotels, I can only recommend the W Times Square to those who wish for easy access to the hotels on-site nightlife. Despite the convenient location and ultra-hip decor, it cannot make up for the glaring problems at the high price level."

177,1991,"Feb 17 2008 	The W -- Trendy Hotel in Times Square	W Times Square is a very trendy hotel. Upon entering the lobby from the ground floor, you experience a water fall on the ceiling. It's cool! You have to take the elevator to the 7th floor to check in. The elevator plays cool, funky music, not the typical Muzak you here. On Floor 7, you will find the Whatever, Wherever congierge, the living room/bar and check-in. You have to take separate elevators to your room--it's an added safety feature so that bar-goers do not go up to the floors with the rooms. You will have to put your room card in the slot for the elevator to work. The hallways of the room floors are dark--that is one of my only complaints. It goes with the trendy vibe but I think the walls are black, lending to a cavelike feel. If you have poor vision, beware! The rooms are great. The mattresses can't be beat. The linens are soft and the satin comforter is wonderful! Loved the flat screen tv. My only other complaint was the shower. There is only half of a glass door. Kind of strange. The water won't flood over even though you think it will. I would have enjoyed the shower more if there was a full curtain or shower door. There are sliding doors to the bathroom without a lock. There's no fan in the bathroom. I did miss turn down service. For the amount of money, it should be something that is included, not something you have to ask for. I also enjoyed the Bliss products. The Blue Fin offers a tasty breakfast menu. It is a bit pricey but it is located right on the ground floor of the hotel. It's convenient. There are tons of Starbucks around if that is more up your alley. Overall, our stay was great, comfortable and we would return."
178,1991,"Jan 24 2008 	Worst Service Worst Staff	I planned my NY trip 4 months ahead and I made my hotel reservation 3 months before. Everything was going fine, made my confirmation call to make sure my reservation is good....however when my friends and I arrived at the hotel, the staff (not kind, no smile) began to look for other available rooms on her computer. Later she was saying, &quot;We ran out of the rooms you reserved, if you like to get the room you reserved, you have to wait till we give you a call&quot; When I asked her how long, she just said we have to wait till they give us a call. (wow, unbelievable)What is the point of making a reservation? Yes, people make reservation so that they do not have to wait for their room at arrival. Still at this moment, there was no apology from this staff. After complaining for 5 mins, I was able to talk to their 'manager' and he was busy trying to explain what was happening instead of apologizing. After another complaining for 5-10 mins, the manager ended up calling the cleaning lady to clean up our room in hurry. 3 months ahead-Reserved room, not ready? Never seen this before.After 40 mins of waiting in the lobby we were able to get our room. On the 3rd day, at 2 am in the morning, fire alarm goes off and put all the people in panic. Couldn't sleep. Service- zeroStaff- zero"
179,1991,"Jan 22 2008 	Wow or Waste of Time?	WE booked the &quot;W&quot; then I looked at the reviews on Trip Advisor . As they were mixed I felt nervous that I'd booked the right hotel! We arrived and all the doorman were brill ( Thankyou &quot;TJ&quot;) The hotel is very modern and contempory. You walk through the lobby and get the lift to the 7th floor where the reception is!We was told that our room was on the 40th floor. We had to put our room card in a slot in the lift then press our floor number. I dissagreed with other reports that some thought this was too much and a pain! I loved the extra security as we were 3 women alone and knowing that you could only use the lift if you had a room key was a comfort!We had a fab room on the 40th floor overlooking &quot;Broadway&quot; which was great! The room was modern, very comfortable beds with everything we needed and quiet, we didn't have any noise at all! .I agree with other reports that the corridoors are dark,as they're keeping the flow of the modern feel, and if you suffer from poor vision then perhaps this isn't the hotel for you!All in all would I go back? Yes I would! My 15 year old daughter would love this hotel ! It's perfectly placed for all the shows which are within mins walking distance!The &quot;Blue Fin&quot; restaurant is good with live &quot;Jaz music&quot; and the hotel bar is buzzing!"
180,1991,"Jan 21 2008 	A Hip Hotel in Times Square	My husband and I stayed at the W Times Square in December. We picked this hotel becuase it was hip and modern and felt that it would provide the experience that we were looking for, while costing the same as other hotels in the area. Loved:- the location in Times Square, within walking distance to Rockerfeller Center (Top of the Rock, NBC Studios, Saks), 5th Avenue, Radio City Music Hall, Broadway , MOMA etc. and many great restaurants (Bobby Van's and Carmine's) and shopping- the bar on the 7th floor was always busy with hotel patrons and the after work crowd and a great place to hang out after dinner.- the hotel was clean- the music in the elevators and in the room (CD)- the comfortable bed! - the big shower- the complimentary Bliss bath and body products!- the view from the 39th floor of the Wonderful roomAfter reading the reviews, and looking through the pictures, we were prepared for what we got- it's not luxurious, but it definitely has a young, hip feel to it. This is not a classic hotel- the hallways are black and the reception is on the 7th floor along with the bar- so it's really important to decide what type of experience you are looking for. This hotel may not be ideal for older travellers looking for a contemporary experience and those with kids. Overall, we were very happy with our stay and would stay there again."
181,1991,"Jan 16 2008 	Fading Fast	I have stayed in the W Times Square probably 20 times over the last three years, and reluctantly, I have decided not to go back until they renovate or make changes. Here are the key problems:1. Rooms have deteriorated badly. They have become markedly dirtier, and are fraying everywhere. Desk chairs are broken, and furniture is chipped and worn. Lightbulbs don't work, and walls are scuffed. Hall carpets and walls are dirty, so it is probably a good thing they have very dim lighting. Many rooms smell of smoke.2. Despite my going there very frequently, and being an SPG premier member, I never receive any benefit from the hotel -- in contrast to the W Union Sq, which upgrades me and provides little comps. Every time I go, it is like the first time I have ever been there as far as they are concerned.3. Don't bother with the Whiskey, downstairs, which is ten years past its prime.The best things about the place remain the sushi and food at Blue Fin, and the location. Options have expanded in the Times Square area, however, so I would look elsewhere. If you like W hotels, the W Union Square is the best one they have in the city by a longshot."
182,1991,"Jan 14 2008	Hip 	Booked the W for an evening in New York. Went with 3 girlfriends. Hotel was uniquely contemporary with candles, waterfalls and dark walls. Fun to sit in Living Room Bar late into night. This is definately for a younger crowd. (We're 50...more geared towards 25-40's). Hotel room was a little worn. Also, hotel room and bathroom small.We found service to be very good. Overall, it was a unique experience, but if you are more traditional, have kids and are 50+ don't think this hotel is for you. The Westin or Marriott, etc are a better choice."
183,1991,"Jan 12 2008 	A good stay at another W	We stayed at this hotel for 1 night over Thanksgiving. This was apparently our 5th stay under my name as the hotel gave us a small gift marking the occasion (a set of thick cards covering walking tours of different parts of NY -- very neat &amp; useful).The rooms are small but the interiors are arranged well enough that they are quite functional. I find the W beds to be very good. Not so much for the sheets &amp; duvet -- which are good but nothing exceptional -- but for the firm mattress. We were celebrating our 10th anniversary &amp; the hotel staff surprised us with a corner room on the top (57th) floor. Stunning views! They also had a small plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries in the room with happy anniversary written in chocolate -- a very nice touch.We didn't stay in the room very much or use the hotel's facilities extensively on this stay. I used the gym, which is small but has well-maintained equipment. (We've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner at Blue Fin in the past and enjoyed the food. I actually look forward to room service at this hotel as the quality is good and the selection extensive.)The doormen &amp; desk staff were friendly &amp; had no attitude whatsoever -- rare in a somewhat stylish hotel in NY! The location is a plus or a minus, depending on what one is looking for. It works well-enough for us -- we can walk to the park &amp; get downtown easily enough via cab.We'll surely stay again, though we wouldn't bring our daughter along due to the small rooms."
184,1991,"Jan 10 2008 	Not up to Starwood or W standards	The staff was not very friendly although the security &amp; concierge were helpful. The rooms were worn out, small, with bad lighting. I stayed at another W Hotel in New York and it was much nicer. I would not stay here for the price. It is a 3-star hotel at best for a 4-star price, and given W's 4.5 star reputation, it was a huge let down."
185,1991,"Jan 9 2008 	Great Location	I think your experience at this hotel is really the luck of the draw. It's in a fabulous location, obviously, but very different. The lobby is on the 7th floor, elevators open out into what we dubbed as &quot;the dicso&quot;. Very funky, dim lighting, vibrant reception staff. Trendites everywhere. We had two different rooms, as due to flight changes, they couldn't add another night onto our original eight-night booking. We had to have separate bookings - &amp; a separate room, which we found a little ridiculous with today's technology! The promised 'personal transfer' of our baggage after the first night into the new room never occured. By 4pm, no move, no new room etc. After shaking them up, we were eventually moved to another room nearby on the same floor. The elevators and corridors (as per other comments), are certainly very dim. Our corridor (37th floor) always smelled badly of old kitchen/garbage smells. On a positive note, the beds and pillows are fabulous and very comfy. On the negative side, our room was extremely stuffy and the aircon had one temp. &quot;Hot and Stuffy&quot;!. We complained several times but it was never fixed, or perhaps could not be. Therefore, we had bad nights' sleep as it was so warm, but to open the window (which we did often) was extremely noisy with the traffic and continual sirens from the street below. Also, in our 8 nights in this room, three bulbs went, bedside and two in the bathroom. We had to continually ask for them to be replaced, one in the bathroom was never replaced and it is so dim in there it made it even dimmer! Also, there is very little place in the bathroom or the room for that matter to place your goodies. Shelfless, modern, grey, clutter free design I suppose. No sofa or comfy chair to sit on - only your bed. As I noted above, your experience here would be luck of the draw as a girlfriend who travelled with us had the opposite problem with her aircon in her room, 10 floors above. It was blowy and cold! It's a fine place to stay if you like the dim, mod look, location is great, clean, staff friendly and bright (you don't get this from too many New Yorkers it seems!). Just bring a torch!"
186,1991,"Jan 9 2008 	overrated worn out and dirty	We've had a corner room (3907) for several days just before New Year's Eve. The room has W's typical bed, which was quite comfy. The flat-screen TV was also OK, decent choice of free TV and pay-per-view. The concierges were helpful and friendly, though you have often to wait 10-15 minutes. However, that's about all the praise for this hotel. Now for the bad part: The walls are really really thin, so if your neighbour is coughing, you'll check if he might be standing in your room. 3907 is right next to the ice-machine and the ice-machine-room-door is not closing properly, so you'll hear quite some banging. The bathroom is tiny and hasn't been properly cleaned in ages (water stains everywhere). The TV-sideboard has a 5-inch-gap between the drawers and the mini-bar - that gap was probably the dirtiest place I have seen in any hotel in the past few years. The glass-table was also as dirty as one could imagine it to be; the fingerprints that were there upon arrival were still there upon departure. Many people bring pizzas or coffee from the neighbourhood into the hotel, so don't be surprised to see all the fast-food junk in the corridor (and don't let me even mention the smell).W makes a big deal about its design - don't let it fool you. Design translates here into minimalism in all aspects, not into quality. I believe that there are better hotels at much better rates, even considering the W's prime location.And, lest I forget: We've left our luggage for storage (our flight home was only in the early evening) and had to learn that they were unable to retrieve it. After some searching, it turned up: dumped and unattended in a darker corner of the lobby. Not something you want to see if your laptop and other valuables are in the trolley. No excuse from the staff - they couldn't have cared less."
187,1991,"Jan 4 2008 	Wow!!	Wow!! We just got back from a fabulous one night trip to NYC. The W Times Square was fantastic to say the least, the concierge was extremely helpful, reccomending a great restaurant near the comedy club we visited.The hotel was absolutely gorgeous, very hip and trendy! Our room was beautiful, we stayed in a &quot;spectacular&quot; on the 49th floor and had a gorgeous view of both the Hudson &amp; Times Square.We had some issues with our TV remote, and maintenance was on it in just 5 minutes. We were also able to check in nearly an hour earlier than we anticipated.Overall we had a great experience and would love to do it again as soon as possible!"
188,1991,"Jan 1 2008	W must stand for the ""Worst""?	I was shocked at the condition of this place. I've had very nice experiences in the past with hotels in the Starwood chain so it was unbelievable to me that there was mold in the shower...:disgusting &quot;crud&quot; around the baseboards , a light fixture in the shower that was hanging off the wall.....and the room was so hot we couldn't sleep. They were nice enough to bring us a fan and tell us to &quot;just open our windows&quot;......a great idea for a restfull night in the middle of Times Square huh?  No question, it's very convenient to theatre and good restaurants but so are lots of other places . So, if you are over 25 and not into the &quot;disco-prison&quot; decor, I'd advise avoiding it. There are lots of places near by, for less/or the same money and a lot cleaner and comforting after a great day in a great city."
189,1991,"Dec 31 2007 	W stands for Worn Out	We just returned from a vacation with our three children. The W Times Square is not a great place to be with young children and we would discourage any family with young children from staying there.We were quite disappointed with the lack of cleanliness at the W Times Square. The bathrooms were filled with grime and grit. The rooms were dusty and the furnishings were tattered. Even though we complained, it took about three phone calls and 48 hours for the bathrooms to be cleaned properly. One of the light fixtures in the room was missing a bulb and it was never replaced during our stay.We did, however, find that the concierge at the W was extremely helpful and had good restaurant suggestions."
190,1991,"Dec 27 2007 	W stands for Way Cool!	We were unsure whether to book the W or the Sofitel in New York for July 4th weekend. In the end we chose the W for the location. We were not disappointed! The hotel is super cool and in quite a nice spot in Times Square.The front desk upgraded us to the top floor corner room with a great view of the river - for free! They were so nice. The room was clean, a comfortable size and very trendy. Its a great place to stay if you want something different and fun. Good counter/desk space for a business traveller and enough of the noise and bustle for a tourist.BTW - go to the bar on the same level as the front desk. Awesome martini's and even those who don't drink can appreciate the ambiance. We had family come to meet us and they arrived early so they could hang out!"
191,1991,"Dec 20 2007 	Ultra modern and very dark!!	Hotel W Times Square is a great location for being fairly central for everything you need. This was my 11th trip to NY and I have to say by comparison, the worst hotel, I would not go back. However, the bed was very comfortable with nice feather pillows etc (but you get that now in Marriotts and Milleniums aswell). The view was ok (get better views at the Millenium UN Plaza) The whole hotel was very dark, black corridors, walls,ceiling and floor, bedrooms had all grey walls, woodwork and duvet covers and the rooms had seen better days and needed a bit of a revamp (not nearly as good as the Hotel W in San Francisco). If you like a bath check when you book as not all rooms have bath tubs, also Times Square has LOTS of flashing lights and again, you may want to either pick a quieter location or check where the room is. Overall it was ok, but have stayed at better hotels for the price and personally it was all a bit to grey for me!!"
192,1991,"Dec 14 2007 	Nothing Spectacular - Solid 3 1/2 Stars	Stayed here because friend had free night through AMEX points and rooms were ~$400/night. Room was fairly large, but odd shaped: maybe they blew the wall out of a utility closet for extra space? Nothing about the hotel stands out except for the real grass growing by the elevator in the lobby and the location.Bed was nice, room was clean, but odd shape of room made it feel like I was in basement slumber party. Would not stay here for recent rate of $600/night unless location is essential."
193,1991,Dec 10 2007 	Great hotel and experience	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 1-night visit in the middle of December to experience NYC and see all the sites during the holiday season. It's certainly a must if you are going to visit NYC. The lobby was sleek and stylish and the front desk was helpful. The rooms are great and even have the heavenly soft beds (haven't slept that good in a long time). Our view over looked the Reuters building (NYC skyline) and you can see Times Square but understand you are about a block away. Probably the only time I had no problem with paying (over $300/night) and this hotel is definitely worth the price.
194,1991,"Dec 10 2007 	What a let down	As I sat in the lobby waiting for the front desk to sort out my payment, I took in the sights of the extremely fake porters complimenting all the women who came in and fishing for tips (they preyed mostly on the older crowd who looked like they had money). It was quite sickening. When I finally got to go to my room, the door was directly across from the elevator (I'm talking, step out of the elevator, take one step and have your face in my door.) The hallway was black with very bad lighting. Definitely form over function - have your key out before you get off the elevator.In the room, the furniture was old and battered and the sink had huge cracks in it. The bed was very comfortable but that was the ONLY saving grace and definitely not worth the $600 they were charging per night.Hopefully I won't have to stay here again."
195,1991,"Dec 5 2007 	Over priced worn out hotel	The hotel is over priced and run down. Our towels were frayed, dead roaches on the floor and on our bed, chrome racks in the bathroom rusty, bathroom vents and the floor were dirty. Furniture worn and overall a poor experience. My wife and I will never go to another W Hotel."
196,1991,"Dec 4 2007 	W-onderful Time	Just returned from a busy pre-Christmas get away with my 5 year-old son. The W was perfect! The location excellent for the shows and access to all the NYC Christmastime events. I wouldn't necessarily think of this as a &quot;family&quot; hotel however, it worked for us.Room was comfortable, amenities were all from Bliss. Hotel staff were gracious and overly outgoing to my son. The Blue Fin restaurant at breakfast was delicious and reasonable for a NYC restaurant.I thought this was superior to the W New York."
197,1991,"Nov 30 2007 	Terrible Experience	I made reservations in December 2006 for my granddaughters &amp; I to stay at the W for the Thanksgiving Day parade in 2007. This was a Christmas gift to my granddaughters and I wanted everything to be perfect. I confirmed &amp; reconfirmed that we would have a room on the 22nd floor to watch the parade. This was a huge expense (almost $3,000 for the room for our stay) and it took me a whole year to save the money. We arrived 11/21 with great excitement only to find out that we didn't have reservations for a room on the 22nd floor. They were &quot;sold out&quot;...after making specific reservations a year in advance. I was horrified and terribly disappointed. We ended up on the 40th floor looking down on a miniscule parade. What got me most was that the staff simply did not care and I was offered no retribution at all. I know exactly what happened....somebody more important got the room I booked a year in advance. The W prides itself in &quot;Whatever, Whenever&quot; and they promise to deliver an experience unmatched in the hotel segment. Well, believe me they delivered an unmatched experience... a nightmare! I would not recommend it strictly because of their guest treatment."
198,1991,"Nov 21 2007 	Cool modern decor in awesome location	We got a great deal on the room, which is regularly around $500 and we paid $279. The location, of course, is great. The hotel is sleek and modern which I prefer. The entry is cool if a little small, and the lobby is, too. The room was a decent size and very clean. The design is trendy and unusual. I would stay again for the price, but wouldn't pay over $500 for this room. Everyone on the staff was very friendly-someone even came around just to make sure we were enjoying our stay."
199,1991,"Nov 20 2007 	Worst hotel for the price	This was absolutely the worst hotel for the price I have ever stayed in. I planned a surprise birthday weekend for my husband and another couple and decided to splurge and get the &quot;fantastic suite&quot; for each couple at a price tag of almost a thousand a night with all the tax and fees. To begin with, we were not able to check into our room until after 4 which was a serious problem as we had formal dinner reservations with a coctail party beginning at 5pm. It wasn't until I was nasty that they miraculously found the rooms were available. I had explained the same earlier in the afternoon and they said it would be no problem, but they kept moving the checkin time in 30 minute increments. Second, there was no coffee pot in the room! So the first morning when I looked around to make some coffee there wasn't a pot. I called and was informed that I could get it from room service. I figured that with the $5 delivery fee plus tax and tip it would have cost $20 for the pot of coffee. Ridiculous!Third, the rooms were so dark (supposedly romantic) that you couldn't even read a book. The elevators were so dark that you had to use the brail to figure out which button to push. Fourth, while I understand that they were trying to increase security, you had to use your room key to go up in the elevator. This is okay but they didn't work half the time. I tried to go down 2 floors to have coffee (from Starbucks) with our friends and had to go down to the lobby and be escorted up to my room, show ID, before I could get a new key. What a pain.I guess i could go on and on about the uncomfortable furniture, the bathrooms where nothing would stay on the sink or back of the toilet, but I guess I have said enough.I will NEVER stay in this hotel again!"
200,1991,"Nov 18 2007 	Trendy and expensive with fabulous view	This hotel certainly attracts a different crowd than other touristy hotel. The accent here is on the hip and cool. You can feel it the moment your cab stop at the front entrance. The service is a polite and friendly manner. The lobby is located on the 7th floor in a multicolor bar on the right and the 4 check-in desks on the left.My SPG status scored me a corner room on the 48th floor which a separate rows of speedy elevators brings me there in an ear-popping instance. The elevator and hallway is club-level lighting using spot lights, good for eyesights training. Unfortunately, in the her speedy time to get off the clock, the check-in lady has given me the wrong key to the wrong room. Another speedy ride down the lobby took care of it.My WOW Fabulous room or whatever it is called is well as hip as the entrance. The dark spa-like tone is accented with some trendy touch here and there (white reading couch and red fluffy pillow). The room is larger than the usual NY room but just by a tiny bit. The two large windows flanking each corner provides good daylight to fill the room. The business desk gives a partial direct view down to Broadway (and the building in front) on one side and a great view to the Hudson river on the other (my favorite view). The windows can also be opened (limited) to remove stale air if needed. The room is equipped with a clock-CD alarm and a nice 32&quot; LG LCD screen with more HD programming than I have seen elsewhere. On the bad side, the wall is paper-thin and when you have noisy neighbor, the street sound is next to nothing. The W bed is fabulous, it tied with the Westin Heavenly Bed as my favorite. Turn-down service is performed every day around 6-7PM and the &quot;Not Now&quot; sign is observed.The bathroom is either an exercises of industrial coolness or just trying too hard to be different. I feels that it is more on the former, the attention to the details are not there: the sink is cracked, the shower leaks, screws are exposed. This is not the level of a $600/night room should look like even if it is in the middle of NY. The saving grace is the bath amenities, the Bliss products are superb. A warning for bathtub lovers, there is only standing showers.On the service side, after check-in in, I was thirsty and found that the VOSS water bottle seal has been broken but the bottle is full. I think the previous guess decided that the $4/bottle was too expensive after using it. I called down to the guest service twice but no-one answered, so much for the whenever-whatever service. I let the check-in desk know the next day and by the time that I left, the same water bottle is still there. On my third day, the ice-machine next to my door broke down and spill water all over the front of my door. A call downstairs and a noisy fan was put in to dry it up. The only thing is that they did not shut it off and I had to come out around 11PM to pull the cord so that I can go to sleep. The Blue Fin restaurant serves decent food. I once forgot my wallet on the table while going to my room to get my phone and my waiter noticed it and hide it for me, nice service here.Location wise, it is one of the hot properties in Times Square but getting a cab in rush hour can be a killer.In short, if you want a hip weekend stay, this may be the place for you. Otherwise, there are better alternatives."
201,1991,"Oct 30 2007 	Cool lobby	We have just got back from 4 days honeymoon in New York staying at the W Hotel on Times Square. We got an upgraded room on the 53rd floor which had dual aspect windows overlooking Times Square. The room was fantastic with a huge bed and the bathroom was really cool. The only problem was the noise of the air-con units from the other hotels, it was really loud and with the sound of the traffic as well, ear plugs were needed. I know that Times Square is loud, but be warned!Don't expect too personal a service as the lobby has a very popular bar in it which non-guests use a lot, but the staff were only to pleased to help and we also got a complimentary bottle of champagne as it was our honeymoon. It wasn't cheap because of it's location, we paid $500 per night, but it was so handy for Broadway shows and shopping and you can easily see the big W on the side of the hotel if you can't remember the block number!Bags can be left before and after check-in for as long as needed and if it's raining they'll loan you an umbrella for the day.All together a very good place to stay, if a little pricey, but if you're only staying for a few days then it's worth it."
202,1991,"Oct 27 2007	Decent hotel in the heart of times square	My husband and I stayed at the W Times Square with our 21 month old daughter for 5 nights. We are Starwood members, so we were able to use our 50% off rack rate coupon; the hotel was about $400/night with taxes (usually $800). Though the W is totally NOT kid friendly, we all had a blast, including our toddler. Everyone from the doorman to the checkin staff were excellent, and went out of their way to help us. They gave us a crib and a fan (to block out the city noise at night) which worked out really well. The Starwood cribs never have bumpers though, which is a total pain!! Her pacifier kept falling on the floor! Next time we stay at a Starwood property, I'll consider bringing a bumper with us. I loved the lobby's stylish decor, and totally felt right at home. The atmosphere is chic and modern, yet welcoming and cozy at the same time. Our only complaint is people under 21 are not allowed in the bar area. Since the &quot;bar area&quot; pretty much takes up the whole lobby, this can be a problem for little kids. My daughter walked about 3 feet away from me whiile I was chatting with the concierge, and the security guard immediately got on my case. We stayed on the 14th floor and our room was not too small. The bed is the most comfortable hotel bed ever! Much better than the Westin &quot;Heavenly Bed&quot; if you can imagine that.... I love the use of space and various design elements, but sometimes the W sacrifices function for style. For example, the bathroom door does not lock (!) and the bathroom walls and door are made out of varigated translucent glass, so if you turn out the bathroom light at night, the entire hotel room is lit up. Stupid design, but it sure does look nifty. Also, the bedside tables are beautiful, but have zero storage space. Not even a single drawer to stash your books. I've stayed in a lot of hotels, most of which have really ugly hallways. The W probably takes the cake for &quot;worst hotel hallways known to mankind&quot; though. I think they are supposed to look hip and modern, but in reality they are just ugly black tunnels with absolutely no sense of grace or &quot;flow&quot;. Really quite shockingly bad considering how well designed the rest of the hotel is. We walked from the hotel to Soho ( a long walk, but very fun) and from the hotel to the Met and the upper West side. Times square is a great central location to explore the city!"
203,1991,"Oct 17 2007	Bring a Flashlight	The Fantastic Suite was a bit shy of fantastic. My wife and two daughters stayed for three nights. The location of the W is a big plus however it is unlike any hotel i have ever stayed in. The check in lobby is really a bar. The check in desk is tucked behind a wall in the bar on the 7th floor. It is so dark, it was a hit and miss in the elevator of over 50 floor buttons to choose from. The halls are a total black out. The rooms are very dark also especially the bathroom. The rooms were not very clean either.The bed was so uncomfortable it was hard to sleep. However if highlighters, scotchtape and a stapler are something you require during your stay they were in the room. The guys that worked the street door were great but from there on I would not reccomend this place. I will not stay there again.If you do bring a flashlight or learn braille."
204,1991,"Oct 15 2007 	expensive frat house	Toronto/Canada Just came back from three nights at the w times square for which I paid 569. a night. The location is great . The entrance small but nice. There the positive ends. The staff are like the cast of a bad play. With the exception of one very nice young women at the concierge desk. THE ROOMS ARE FILTHY! The first room we were given had a broken door, dirty floors and and an unclean sink and toilett. Sent us up to the 54 th floor with an adjoining room door where we had the privledge of listening to a couple argue and vomit one night and have noisy sex the next. The lobby or living room as they like to call it is a noisy dark bar filled with people who drink to the point of vomitting. The decor is cheap and unattractive with a side of uncomfortable. The robes are cheap nylon blend and seldom laundered. The bathrooms are the dirtiest I have ever seen in a hotel. Overcharged me on my bill. We didn't try the restaurants but they were always empty even when other places had line ups. This is the worst hotel I have stayed at in any country. Don't waste your money."
205,1991,"Oct 12 2007 	Very chic	Stayed here with my girlfriend during one of our first stays in New York (decided to look into the Westin after). The hotel is extremely chic and very trendy! Starting from the entry lobby off Broadway in Times Square (very, very, very good location!!) to the lobby upstairs... This hotel knows how to be trendy and elite!The room was standard, but a corner room. It had a very modern Japanese feeling to it. Everything was jet black, including the dark hallways, and quite small feeling. The music CD provided was a nice touch and provided good background music during time in the room. The one thing that I didn't like was the bathroom. The walls and door were made of a thin Japanese paper like material that didn't block sound and was just translucent. The bathrooms were by definition, &quot;chic,&quot; but wish they were more practical.The drinks in the lobby bar were very good. A good place to grab a drink to start off your big night in the city. Concierge was pretty helpful, although he always seemed busy. The check in people were fast and did a good job.I would recommend this hotel to young, hip couple-travellers, but families and tourists should steer clear! For the same price you could get a room at the Westin that's 2x larger."
206,1991,"Sep 11 2007	Wicked W	A five night visit to New York with our twin daughters to congratulate them on A level success before they go off to University. I researched lots of hotels and as their reaction to the W was &quot;wicked&quot; sounds like I got it right. (Funny how our language is changing.) Minimalistic design is the current trend and is quite appealing, particularly with the younger generation.Reception at the door very friendly, staff at front desk efficient and helpful, other staff we met just the same.First impressions really good and remained so throughout our stay. Our bedroom was large, the attached living room with sofa bed large also, good facilities, impressive view of Broadway, very well positioned for easy access to all the sights.New York certainly knows how to take your money from you.The W is priced similar to most NY hotels of this standard but it's expensive nevertheless, we didn't use the restaurant because of cost but it was also more fun to dine out especially with such a great choice of deli's nearby.If you stay in Times Square you've got to like lights, crowds and music but it's a fascinating place to be and the hotel provides a very modern, sophisticated and quiet retreat. Go for it!Mike BaylissCheshire. UK."
207,1991,"Sep 11 2007 	Amazing hotel stunning views!!!	We have stayed in several hotels in NY and this is by far the best! we were on 46th floor and had a corner room so had 2 views which were amazing and looked fab day and night, this was over times square, you cant get much better than that!!! When we arrived we fell in love with all the water falls that surround you and then you go up to the lobby and its very modern but has a warm cosy feel, loads of comfy sofas and beautiful flowers, everywhere immaculate at all times.The staff were very friendly and always helpful so the service we were very impressed by.The room was fab its perfect for NY sleak simple and unclutered which after a long day shopping is perfect, i partulally liked all the soft lighting in the room and hotel. The bed was soooo gorgeous I didnt want to get up most mornings!The location was great right in the heart of New York, yes you do hear a little traffic noice eg sirens now and then but come on this is new york city!!!2 points, internet you have to pay for $16.95 in the room for broadband connection or free in lobby if you can get a signal!and there was no coffee machine in room which we felt for $500 a night room this we should have had!I would definatley stay here again and if you prefere a more classic american style then this isnt the hotel for you, if you do your research on the hotel group you will know what their style is like and you wont be disapointed."
208,1991,"Sep 8 2007 	Great	We are just an average couple, both work very hard, vacations are few and far between and we had a great time at this hotel. After staying at cheaper hotels in Manhattan in the past (bear in mind high rate where we come from would be $120/night so we thought $200 wouid be sufficient - NOT!!), security was a big thing for us and we felt comfortable at this hotel. We read that the rooms were small, but we found them average size. Staff were VERY friendly and accomodating. We are not pretentious and certainly not hip, but we had a great time :).The bed was great, the cleaning staff were immaculate, the Bliss bath products were lovely and we had a pretty good view of Times Square. If you are a fragrance person, you will appreciate the cool aroma of gardenias (??) after a long day of trapsing a not always &quot;rosy&quot; smelling city. We will be back"
209,1991,Sep 6 2007	very modern	Very nice hotel. Great modern hotel. Everything is a little dark because of the style but this is a happening hotel. The bar in the Lobby was awesome. Good location and excellent service.
210,1991,"Aug 27 2007	Great customer service	Stayed 3 nights and were very pleased with the staff responsiveness to all requests. They have an excellent can-do attitude which was refreshing. The rooms are small with minimalistic decor. The bathrooms are very tiny- with a stall shower and no countertop space for personal toiletries. We found space for our stuff on the rack below the sink. The bed was very comfortable, decent closet space with safe, and the Bliss amenities were excellent.The location is terrific located on 47th just off Broadway so everything was accessible by foot. The only problems we noted were the connecting room doors are very thin and we heard every conversation held next door- and the dark hallways and elevators, while attractive made it difficult to navigate.We'd stay there again, but would suggest if you are older and/or have any vision problems e.g., reading menus in candlelight, you'll have problems in the elevators and hallways so consider another hotel."
211,1991,"Aug 27 2007 	Tries Too Hard to be Hip	My 20-something wife and I stayed here for a weekend getaway to celebrate her birthday, and were very impressed with the location and friendly service. Unfortunately, even with these factors working for it, W New York - Times Square tries too hard to be trendy and ends up pulling off a forced style that's neither cutting-edge nor inviting. The hotel's futuristic &quot;living room&quot; felt more like a nightclub than a lobby, and the pulsating techno music and light show blasting on the suspended pillars only added to this effect. Another thing that hit us as soon as we walked in was the floral air-freshener scent permeating the entire building. This might have been pleasant were it not so overwhelming. After discovering that our room wasn't ready at check-in, we left our bags with a polite concierge and walked around Times Square. The desk associate said she would call me when my room was ready, but after 3 hours and no call we headed back, ready to take whatever room they had. A high-speed elevator sped us to the 44th floor and discharged us into a dark, spaceship-like hallway with black walls and extremely low lighting. It was like walking into a laser tag building. I was hoping our room would be more inviting than the hallways, but the steel-gray color scheme and cold metallic accoutrements made the already tiny space feel closed and uninviting. One of our pillows was stained and dirty, and the chipped paint and worn fixtures throughout hinted to frequent use, infrequent maintenance or both. All services inside and outside the room will cost you a pretty penny on top of the mint you've already paid for the room itself. Even the bottled water, which is free in most of the lower-tier Sheraton hotels, was $6 a bottle. Yikes! For a hotel rated so high by Starwood I expected much more. On the bright side our &quot;spectacular room&quot; view lived up to its billing, and the shower was great. The location is superb, but for the price there is better to be had in midtown Manhattan. I probably &quot;W&quot;on't be staying here again."
212,1991,"Aug 26 2007 	Great Visit	My husband, son (7 yrs) and I stayed at the W in Times Square for 2 nights in early August. The service was excellent - very friendly and attentive (without being in your face). We stayed on the 50th floor and had a great view straight down Broadway. The room was very quiet and comfortable - the beds were SO COZY! We enjoyed dinner at the hotel restaurant one evening. The food was excellent - the sushi was particularly good. We will definitely consider staying there again on our next visit to NYC."
213,1991,"Aug 11 2007	Always love this Hotel	I travel alone frequently and I love this hotel. I love the corner rooms for the great views, the VERY comfortable bed, the great shower and just the location for a little times square mayhem. I've stayed here several times and have never been disapointed. I'm not sure if the average family would appreciate it, but I love the place."
214,1991,"Aug 9 2007 	Perfect for an experience of Manhattan!	Me and my family have just returned from a 9 night stay in the 'W' Hotel in the middle of Times Square. I have to say, that despite some of the reviews on here, I found it an absolutely fabulous stay and none of us wanted to come home! The maid service, concierge assistance, decor, quality of the rooms and the staff in general were all absolutely fantastic. The only down sides I can think of where when we received a phone call on around the 7th day to ask if anybody had been smoking in the room as the smoke detectors had been activated. We mentioned that none of us had smoked or ever smoked in our lives, they still proceeded to charge 200 to the account. We realised this under the 'account review' facility on the television in the room and we quickly alerted this to their attention and they quickly removed it. However, they had put it under the subject of 'restaurant charge' which I thought was rather sneaky, so make sure you check your account quite reguarly and make sure your stay is totalled up correctly. Also on the last day the toilets blocked in both of our rooms but the maid service was quick and it was fixed within the hour, so that wasn't a problem. On regard to the room, the showers also slightly overflowed in both rooms, but only slightly and bath mats are provided. It was my mother's and my birthday whilst we was there, and we received a teddy bear, a bottle of champage, balloons and two slices of cake which was very generous of them. I think this may have something to do with the fact that my father had had a lot of contact with one of the staff prior to arrival asking questions about New York in general as it was our first visit. Her name was Lydia Chaperone and she was incredibly helpful and made our trip perfect for us. She is definitely a credit to the hotel, so I would always ask for her assistance. Kelly on the concierge desk also got us into some great restaurants and shows during our stay and gave us some great advice which would benefit us financially instead of simply thinking about the hotel's income from ticket brokers etc. The location of the hotel is fantastic - right in the centre of Times Square and a couple of blocks away from Broadway. I can't really comment on the value of the hotel, as my father and mother paid for a suite and then from the points earnt at starwood hotels, they paid for our room with those. I personally think you get value for money as the rooms are quite big for a city and the staff were absolutely brilliant. However, my father suggested that next time if we were to come again, we may rent an apartment as it would most likely work out cheaper, but for first time New Yorkers, it's a great way to get a feel for the city and they guide you along the way with the best things to see and do. Manhattan is an absolutely fantastic place to be. It is the ultimate city in my opinion and I have visited many. Central Park provides a calm from the hectic city life and places such as Soho and Greenwich Village are not too busy as the main areas too and are great for a coffee and a walk to get a feel for New York. The people were very friendly too.All in all a great break and such a refreshing taste of life. If not a little crazy! But that's the way New York is, and that's what makes it so special."
215,1991,"Aug 9 2007 	The W Hotel in Times Square	We just returned from a trip to The W in Times Square and had a great time during our first trip to New York because of the excellent service there! The first and best thing I have to say about the hotel is that the staff is so friendly and very accomodating. I had Michael at the concierge desk helping me, and together we planned the entire trip and he took care of arrangements for everything - even VIP seating at Yankees Stadium! Even an odd request for a restaurant that has white truffle macaroni &amp; cheese didn't phase them, they had a list for me the next day. The maids and front desk clerks are all very polite and professional as well. Two different nights they sent us bottles of champagne with chocolate-covered strawberries, on the house, and they also had a great doggy nanny service (yes, they take pets!)The rooms are small (we got an upgraded room but it was still tiny), but we knew NYC hotel rooms are tiny going in and the way they have the rooms decorated, they feel a lot bigger than they are. We had huge windows overlooking Times Square, and the room has block light walls and mirrors all over to give it an open feeling. The room (and the hotel) are decorated beautifully ... very modern and trendy, yet somehow classic as well. They were working on their lobby/living room but even through construction it is a stunning space. And the rumors are true - the best beds EVER, you are surrounded by down and the sheets were divine. Very soft, after a long day in the sun walking it was nice to slip into those cool sheets!Now to the (minor) negative things that prevented me from giving a 5-star rating - our air conditioning went down to 65 the first night, but after that it would stop running if we turned it below 69. We like quite a chilly room (especially with the heavy comforters on the bed) and the AC didn't really seem to keep up all the time. Another complaint is we saw a silverfish in the bathroom, it ran under a barely see-able crack in the floor before we could kill it but that was the only one we saw. Surprised us because the room and hotel look immaculate otherwise.Our only other complaint would be the noise - we were given a room right across from the maid's closet and in the mornings all we could hear were them constantly opening and closing the doors, getting stuff out, talking, vaccuuming, etc. There wasn't a lot keeping hallway noise out of the room. Also, you can hear the traffic from the street below. It never kept either of us from sleeping, but very light sleepers may want to be aware you will faintly hear honking and sirens all night long.Overall, not bad - we'd definitely stay here again but would request a room far away from elevators and maid's closets!"
216,1991,"Aug 6 2007 	Very Cheesy	Aside from the &quot;trying way too hard to be trendy&quot; atmosphere, the things that really make you roll your eyes are upstairs past the &quot;living room&quot; (aka lobby lounge). From the peep show motif hallways (black walls, black carpet, black ceiling, and black lights), and the hotel ammenities book in the format of a Benjamin Moore paint sample book to the Ikea gray on gray room furnishings and everything categorized under a &quot;W word&quot; ... the only ones that constantly came to mind was WHY and WHATEVER.The minor irritations are magnified by the annoying trendiness of the hotel .. such as, no turn down service: Leave your room a mess at lunch time .. the same mess will be there when you get back after dinner. No fresh towels, no straightend out bed, no mint on the pillow, no music playing in the room, etc - you know, the kind of thing that EVERY hotel on the planet does as a basic service. The room wasn't very clean especially the bathroom and the noise in the hallway was like having no door whatsoever. So, basically ... the W is all style and no substance. And the style is not for everyone and definately not for me."
217,1991,"Aug 6 2007	Loved the Trendy decor	This is an amazing and stylish hotel, really trendy with great staff and the room was very comfortable. The view over the Hudson river was breathtaking. It is so well situated for everything and we had a great stay. The only down point was that when we got home we found that we had a very large amount charged to our credit card after we had left the hotel and setlled the bill which was outrageous so this slightly dampened the euphoria of our stay. We got it all back but it was a bit tedious having to fight our corner to get it back. A bit of a disgrace on the part of the hotel and we know that this happened to the 2 other couples we were with as well so they need to sort this out. However other than keeping a close eye on charges I would thoroughly recommend this stunning hotel."
218,1991,"Jul 31 2007 	The W marks the spot.	This hotel is located ideally in the center of Times Square. The only problem with being so centrally located is getting to it by car. Once we got to the hotel, traffic diversions caused my wife and I to travel in circles for about 30 minutes until finally landing in the hotel's very tight driveway. I would suggest leaving the car at the airport and having a taxi or subway take you there. Besides... NYC is a great city to enjoy on foot, especially when your hotel is located near everything. You must proceed to a higher floor to check in. The lobby is adjacent to a super cool dance club/martini bar with music blasting deep bass notes that cause your body to magically start swaying from side to side. The clientelle of the club look to be straight off of a runway fashion show. I must admit my wife and I were a little intimidated by them, but secretly we could not stop staring at the beautiful people surrounding us. The rooms are like many we have seen at the W hotels, only slightly smaller. The contemporary furnishings are surprisingly comfortable, and the ultra modern bathroom fixtures are a lot of fun to figure out. The bed in particular was &quot;heavenly&quot; as described by the bellman who took us to our room. The staff of the hotel are very knowledable and less snooty than some we have experienced in NYC. They seem to genuinely care whether the customers are enjoying their stay and they time in NYC. We have stayed at hotels that provided much more in the way of amenities, but the W is what it is. A hip, modern, hotel. If you are into this style, then give it a try."
219,1991,"Jul 26 2007 	Stylish experience but not relevant for a stay in Manhattan	The W Hotel at the Times Square is directly located on Broadway and 47th Street at the heart of the Times Square. As described already in other reviews, the hotel is very stylish, with the reception and lobby on the 7th floor. The regular rooms are going to the 33rd floor, above you have the upgraded rooms with very stylish names. The hotels interior is mainly styled in black, with the exception of the entry on the ground floor (water fall above your head) and the lobby on the 7th floor. I got an upgrade and styed for two nights on the 35th floor. The rooms are spacious with a king size bed, a large office desk and toilette/bath room. Thw room had two huge mirrors, a FlatTV and a nice shower behind a glas front. The rooms pretend to be very stylish, but made on relatively cheap materials from my judgement. Internet is not for free, breakfast I have not tried. The hotel owned restaurant 'Blue Fin' serves good fish food and was over-booked. Overall, a good hotel, but with 330 Dollar for a night not necessary cheap.For a more typical hotel experience, better try the Crowne Plaza, one block away and proper hotel feeling."
220,1991,"Jul 25 2007 	Worst hotel in New York	Extremely disappointed with my stay at the W Hotel Times Square. Bit of an understatement, actually. I was apalled by the hotel and the attitude of the staff.During my stay at the hotel, employees of the hotel came in, had sexual intercourse, and left a used condom in my room while I was out. I found the used condom. Hotel staff responded by trying to tell me it wasn't a big deal, and person at the front desk thought it was hilarious. I spoke with the Hotel manager, Ana MacDiarmid. Although they know the people that came into the room having done an electronic lock inquiry, they have not taken any disciplinary actions on the employees. They offered me 2 free nights as an &quot;apology&quot;.Needless to say, their apology and their behavior leaves a lot to be desired. I've also filed this with the Better Business Bureau and the New York Department of Consumer Affairs. I am debating whether to file with the New York Department of Human and Health Services.I would avoid this hotel for any kind of stay."
221,1991,"Jul 24 2007 	can't beat location	After reading the reviews I was a little uncertain if I had boked the right hotel for us. But upon arrival I could not have been more pleased. The customer service is exceptional. The location in times square, broadway and subway was great. And our room was well maintaned,with a fantastic view. And yes the halls and elevator are dark, there are young(30ish). people everywhere and the lobby fills with them but not so much that it was ever a problem. we are in our 50s and never felt out of place. I would definitly stay there again."
222,1991,"Jul 10 2007	W not so wonderful!	Very unhappy-Hotel Location, Valet Service, Lobby, Desk great!!! Elevator and Halls dark, so dark you can't even see the elevator buttons.Entering room, you think maybe you are in an IKEA store. Bathroom is dirty/Accumulated dust on every baseboard/rack/Shower Mildewed/No exhaust fan-and enclosure is such that you can see shadow of every movement of those occupying the bathroom!! No hooks in bathroom, shelves are dirty/rusty and you don't want to put your clothes on them. Room is also very dark..very little &quot;good&quot; lighting, if it had been raining I cant imagine how dark it would have been..maybe this is on purpose to not notice the rooms are not clean.Room service tray left in hall of neighbor from 9PM Friday night until at least 11AM Saturday (when we left)-did not smell good.My last stay at any &quot;W&quot;."
223,1991,"Jul 7 2007	Good and bad	The Spectacular room, which we had booked ( above 32nd floor), wasn't ready at 3:45, so we took a room on the 21st floor. The room was nice, and we got a thirty dollar discount for taking it.The big problem is that the walls are paper thin. Our neighbors got in while we were taking a nap. We heard, very clearly, that they were planning to attend a show at the Majestic Theater. After that, we heard them making love. None of this was loud. It was all in regular voices - just things I would prefer kept private. I'm sure they would have , too.I wouldn't stay here again."
224,1991,"Jul 2 2007	would rather stay at the marriott	This hotel was way tooooo modern for my taste. It definately had a cool entrance with the water walls but the overall feeling is bleek at best. The hallways and room walls are VERY dark!!!!! The almost pitch black halls to your room have very tacky electric blue lights over the door. When you go in, the walls are covered in dark grey paint. The furniture was cool to look at but very uncomfortable. The bathroom was absolutely the worst I've ever seen!!!! 2 of the walls are glass shaded walls and has a sliding door. There is no privacy whatsoever!!! The shower was completely see through, all glass doors that don't lock, so the water goes all over the floor no matter what you try. Aside from the obvious very overpriced, the luggage was an issue. We asked the desk to hold our stuff, we waited 10 minutes and asked again....finally the girl behind the desk took it...but they take it to another floor in heaps, so you check it but then they leave it unattended until someone comes to take it downstairs. Most hotels have a convenient room by the desk so you don't have to wait. It was completely unorganized. Definately a nice place, just not my cup of tea AT ALL!"
225,1991,"Jun 28 2007 	wow times square	we stayed at the W in one of the fantastic rooms for a week in june for my 30th birthday, with a slice of cake waiting for us in the room it was a treat and then a bottle of champas on my actual b.day they added that personal touch, we felt the service was great , the location was amazing and yes as a lot of reviews had said the loby music was loud and dim lighting but if its too loud your too old! we thought the place was excellent by far up there on the top 5 places we have stayed in the world and we travel a lot! for NYC the room size was very good, and spacious, the only negative being the bathroom was hard for for my wife to do her makeup no bench top but it was way funky!We ordered breakfast in bed although pricey it was very nice as was the loby bar for a cocktail prior to heading out for the night.all in all i would HIGHLY recomend the W times square."
226,1991,"Jun 25 2007 	Best hotel I've ever stayed in	This is truly the best hotel I've ever stayed at, for numerous reasons. The service was excellent, the room and view was beautiful, the modern deco of the entire building was fantastic, the bar/lounge was great, and the food was delicious. I went to New York City as a graduation present, and my mom just happened to mention that to one of the women who worked there. After we got settled into our room, that same young woman came up with a balloon and package of free souveniers for a graduation present, along with a handwritten card! It really made my trip. The room had a sort of modern art theme, and had two rooms (since we booked the large suite.) The view was magnificent. The beds were very comfortable. The art and setup of the room was unlike anything I've ever seen before. Even the minifridge was neat; it had all different types of snacks, products, even a tshirt and teddy bear! I admit they were expensive, but if you're the type to splurge every once in a while, it's for you. The furniture is both comfortable and creative. The room overall is just incredible. The lounge had a bar, and a bunch of cozy areas to sit and chat. In the evenings it's very busy (which is good if you want to meet people), but during the day and before 6:00 it's a quiet area to relax in. You could just sit there and look at the cosmopolitan modern decorations and furniture for hours and never get bored. It also has free internet acess, whereas in the room there's a fee. The lounge and lobby is on the second level; the first level is an entrance with water on the roof and walls (very worth seeing!) The room service, and everything else about this hotel was excellent! I give this hotel 10 thumbs up, if I had that many thumbs. If you can afford to spend some extra money, you defininately should consider the W in Times square."
227,1991,"Jun 21 2007	Enjoyed evry moment of it!!!	From the moment the Taxi arrived at the hotel, I new we had it made as the location was just perfect. I have read all the reviews about the hotel, prior to our trip and was worried about the noise. we stayed on the 31st floor and did not hear a thing. The view was breath taking.The room was not be huge but It was perfect. The extra large beds and the soft pillows - made us feel as we if we were asleep on fluffy clouds.Very chic and very trendy.I wish we had more time to spend in the room, but we were out most of the time.The Blue finn restaurant is price. If you want a great meal , there is a great restaurant past Virgin megastore - called Maxie's. Their pound of warm Pastrami sandwihiches are to die for!The staff at the hotel were very friendly. I needed a phone charger, as the UK charger did not work ( due to the voltage difference), I was just about going to the shop to buy one, when I thought i would ask the concierge if he has one, and he was happy to lend me one.What did I find wrong? Why are the elevators so dark... ? its hard to see anything in there!!!The corridors are so dark too. Black!!! Why???Will I come back again? Yes Yes Yes! 10 out of 10."
228,1991,"Jun 3 2007 	Not Happy With The W's Customer Service	I arranged for my daughter and a couple of her friends to stay here in April. I paid for the room 1 month before they arrived. I called a week prior to their arrival to make sure everything was in place and reserved a limo for their transfers from the airport. To began with a Sedan picked them up, not a big deal, but at the end of the stay my daughter was billed for a limo. She complained and they removed the charge. She also was charged for snacks that she didn't eat that was also credited. However, when my daughter arrived she gave the front desk her debit card for incidentals, they assured her there would only be a charge if she indeed used any of the services in her room. Her debit card was immediately charged $1500.00. I called and was told this was &quot;common practice in the industry&quot;. My daugher was told by the front desk the maximum amount charged should have only been $200 and they would take care of it immediately and call her bank. It took 6 days to finally get a credit of the $1500. Meanwhile, I had to transfer the funds into my daughter's account to cover her while she was in New York. I emailed the W and called them twice during this ordeal and was assured this would be taken care of immediately. It still took 6 days..."
229,1991,"Jun 1 2007 	Not a 5 star Hotel	The hotels entrance is really cool. The lobby is nice as well and for those who like staying in nosy places its the right hotel. But, when you get into the room, its a disappointement. The room is so small and the the room service is not so good. Its not a great deal, Id rather stay at The Palace NY."
230,1991,"May 31 2007 	Not worth it	We stayed at this hotel over the Memorial day weekend. The location of the hotel, view from the room (Hudson River ) and staff were all great. But the room left a lot to be desired. There were stains on the blinds, the sink was cracked, the shower door didi't shut properly allowing water to get all over the flooor, and you could tell where they patched the shower. Tile/stucco actually stuck out from the rest of the wall. The shower head and pipe actually came out of the wall. Not to mention that it is quite small. I figured for $430 a night we would get something nice and spacious, I guessed wrong. Totally not worth it.Also the halls and elevator and dimly lit, in fact you may need to bring a flashlight into the elevator so you can see which floor you are selecting.The bar area is nice and the drinks are good, but over priced."
231,1991,"May 29 2007	noisy small rooms semi private bathroom	We booked our room through American Express Platinum Services. We knew that the rooms were small, but were anticipating that the upgrade through AMEX Platinum would offer a larger room. When we arrived we found out that in fact all of their rooms were the same size, except suites, and that the upgrade was considered a higher floor. Also, breakfast was to be included which only ended up being a continental breakfast.with really lousy prepackaged muffins. Even though we were upgraded to the top floor, 57, we heard both street noise (sirens day and night, from the firestation located 2 blocks away) and noise from the ice-maker outside of our room. People were also partying both in their room and in the hallway and one could hear maids talking and doors slamming while we were in our own room. The so called bathroom was a frosted glass sliding partition, which offered very little space or privacy,In summary, this hotel is very overpriced, overrated, and we would not recommend it or consider staying there again.LauraPhoenix, ArizonaP.S. If you want a very nice hotel in the time square area, I recommend the Sofitel."
232,1991,"May 17 2007 	Too Loud - Aloof Staff	The Marriott is right across the street and has the same Times Square noise issue to deal with - but they must have much better windows. I was on the 36th floor and it was still very, very loud.Also, there is little to no sound proofing between rooms and to the hallway. I was awoken by the alarm clock from the room next door and by drunken revelers getting in the hallway a different night.I am typically a very sound sleeper and live on a busy street in Lincoln Park (Chicago).Similar to another reviewer, I had a duplicate charge on my bill that I had to bring to their attention, but when I did, they removed it immediately.Finally, the hotel staff seem to like the idea of spending time in a trendy NY hotel but don't realize that it's work. They were quite aloof and not very helpful the couple of times that I interacted with them.On the bright side: it was very, very clean and a very convenient location in New York. However, I would never stay there again and would return to the Marriott, Westin or Hilton (or possibly a different W location)."
233,1991,"May 16 2007 	Bar or Hotel?	We chose the W Hotel Times Square to finish off our three stop honeymoon to the US. The hotel is perfectly located in Times sqaure and the entrance to the hotel is very impressive...... like being in a waterfall.Our check in was fine and the receptionist was very pleasant. However, several other members of the reception staff were pretty unhelpfull on several occasions. It seemed to be a problem for them to change travellers cheques and they imposed a $200 limit per room per day (which doesn't go far in Manhattan). On one occasion I was told that they didnt have much money so they would rather not change my travellers cheques. They did change their mind however when I persisted as it was our last day and we needed the cash for a taxi to the airport.Our hotel room was very comfortable and had impressive views of the Hudson River from one window and Times Square from another. The room had everything you need but was a bit small. However, I believe that all Now York bedrooms are small.The hotel was very trendy and had a really good vibe. It seemed to be the place to be in Times Square. However, it did seem to be that the focus of the hotel was on the bar(s) rather than the hotel guests and bedrooms. This, in my opinion, should be the other way around.I would certainly recommend the hotel, but if you are more on the mature side, it may not be for you. Also, if you dont walk around in Hugo Boss, Prada or Gucci, prepare to be looked at when you enter the hotel after 7.00pm on a weekend as everyone else seems to!Overall, the W Times Square wasn't perfect but it was very good and I would certainly stay their again."
234,1991,"May 15 2007 	Close to Broadway theatres functional but not cheap.	I would generally approve of the hotel, but some technical caveats definitely apply. My wife and I stayed 4 nights (Thursday to Monday in mid-May, 2007). First of all, I booked through the Starwood hotel chain website, which seemed to make sense after poking around for endless hours looking at various hotel and booking options. The comparatively reasonable cancellation policy on their website appealed to me, and (prepare to contain yourself) you can redirect your Starwood points, or whatever they are, to certain other loyalty programs like Aeroplan. So Im sure I saved two percent on the whole deal, and all those hours of travel surfing were not in vain. Note that to do this, you have to sign up in advance for a preferred guest card that they mail out to you, but its free to sign up. Anyway, for what was ostensibly a better than average room (i.e., corner room on 38th floor looking west across the Hudson river) we forked out $429 a night (plus taxes made it around $490 a night). Having never been to NY before we had no idea if this represented a value proposition when compared to other similarly pricey hotels. The hotel is newish, though the odd sign of wear is now visible. The staff did their jobs well on the few occasions we had to actually interact with them (ee.gg., at check in, to get a cab, breakfast servers in restaurant downstairs, send up a guy with replacement room key when ours did not work, leave bags behind for the day on our day of departure, buying stuff in the trendy hotel shop). The room was clean, large enough not to bump into things, the tap water was quite drinkable, the shower had good water pressure, there were lots of towels (some of which can be sacrificed to keep the shower from soaking the whole bathroom floor), the king bed was comfortable, the flat screen TV hanging on the wall had numerous channels and a DVD player (who stays in to watch videos whilst in NY, anyway?), there was a little el cheapo CD player, two nice comfy robes, and also an astonishing array of W brand crap that you can buy, laid out right there in the room like so many bags of chips. And, of course, an over-priced mini bar. We really did enjoy coming back to the room after pounding the NY pavement all day and falling onto the big plush bed, though I appreciate this sounds cheesy. Note that you will need top quality ear plugs at this hotel. The north end of Times Square is right below you, very brightly lit, full of much honking and many all-night sirens, and as a bonus the clowns down the hall on Saturday night will try to drain the ice machine (at least I think thats what they were doing), shout at each other, and then lock themselves out of their room, in which room there may be a roommate, but there is only one way to find out if they are in there. Mind you, once you block out all the noise you can really appreciate the nice bed. We had the feather pillows, and they were a touch squishy, good for stomach sleepers, but I think next time Ill ask for foam. Basically it is a good hotel, but I dont quite get who the target market is. I am assuming the hotel is probably too expensive for most youthful lounge-and-club hipsters at whom the incessant sound track in the common areas seems to be aimed. The lighting in the elevators is so dim I actually had to bend over to read the numbers on the buttons (theres brail on them, though, so I had that to fall back on). The hotels location is ideal for catching Broadway shows nearby, and quite central for most of the top 10 touristy things. Most people there looked as I imagine we did  vaguely annoyed with day 3 of the whole tangerine wheatgrass cool-as-zen W scene, but also happy to be in NY and able to afford a good bed and good ear plugs. Other things in NY that warrant special mention: the Staten Island ferry (seems to depart on the hour and half hour, great views, its free, but they make you get off and then on again at the Staten Island end before coming back to Manhattan); the view from the top of the Rockefeller centre (a swift $17.50 each plus tax; maybe go at odd hours so as not to line up; good shopping nearby); and in the far-from-free category, attending the Metropolitan Opera (buy your tickets way in advance from the Met website for box office pick-up, and then phone to make a 6 p.m. reservation at the very nice Gran Tier restaurant thats also in the opera house (note that the restaurant crowd is dressier than average NY opera attendee) and then before finishing your very nice dinner, be sure to arrange for your waiter to pre-order your intermission chocolate souffl (we found the house champagne was quite doable with it) and then go back to your table at intermission and enjoy it while the mob lines up at the bar. And note that the ladies room at the Met will have a long line just before show time so get the female in your party in line maybe 20 minutes before curtain.)"
235,1991,"May 14 2007 	Check you Bill!	Way overpriced. Worse part was that on checkout, a mysterious $65 dollar charge appeared from hotel bar. We were never there, and the front desk staff made us feel like we had to prove to them that we didn't make the charge. I guess guilty until proven innocent is the motto there. Ruined the whole stay."
236,1991,"May 13 2007 	Getting a little tired...	I agree, you can't beat the W Times Square for location. We have stayed at this property numerous times on our trips into NYC, but I have to say the hotel is beginning to look a little time worn. The first room we were given was right next to a hallway ice machine that had overflowed and soaked the hall carpet so the room had a very strong mold smell. The second room was far better, but still when you turned on the sink there was a moldy odor. The towels, when wet, released a distinctive smell of smoke. (Like the people in the laundry smoked while cleaning the linens!)The furniture in the room was nicked and beaten up like you would see in a college dorm. On a positive note, the beds are comfortable and the pillows divine. We were on the 23rd floor and it is quite noisy at night with emergency sirens.Service was attentive, and we easily managed to get a third night even though the hotel was sold out. The front desk kept us in mind as cancellations came in.We had dinner at the Blue Fin and the service and food were top notch.I do like the Times Square location, but find the Renaissance to be a better deal across the street."
237,1991,"May 8 2007 	It's only okay	I stayed in W Times Square only for 1 night for a quick visit - Pros - Location - cannot beat Times Square Style - very modern, cleanNice toiletryVery nice view of Times Square and Hudson River from our roomCons -Noise - street noise even on 50+floor at night. Seriously.Room - I had a room upgrade to Corner Room and it's still small. Granted it's NYC so I don't expect a big room but for a 2-tier-above-standard room I would like a bathtub.So in short it's kind of a &quot;stuck in the middle&quot; experience. It's not luxurious enough that I am willing to spend a lot of money for, but it's not cheap enough (even with all the advantages) to consider it a bargain."
238,1991,"May 8 2007 	Great Hotel Fantastic Location	I stayed at the W for 4 nights (3rd May -6th May). I was originally assigned a corner room with a connecting door - which you should definitely avoid - I could hear every conversation happening in the connecting room - and my neighbours were talking in a normal volume. I requested another room and was moved straight away.My new room was on the 43rd floor with a great view of Times Square. Very New York - but if you are particularly bothered by noise and light - it might not be the best place for you. I was awoken early on Saturday morning by a very loud concert in the middle of Times Square and the room is lit up by very bright lights on the side of the building, lighting up giant billboards.I didn't mind too much as it was part of the experience of being in such a great location - and the room did have blackout curtains. Other great things about the hotel were the great trendy atmosphere, comfortable modern rooms, relatively well equiped gym, friendly staff, good security (won't let anybody up to the lobby on the 7th floor without a key at night), great comfortable bed, really cool bars and high definition televisions in the rooms.All in all - a very enjoyable experence."
239,1991,"May 4 2007 	trendy but cheap	very trendy hotel. club music piped in everywhere, in the lobby, elevators, hallways, and in the room. Tip - cd's are available for purchase in your room, bring your laptop instead and upload the songs for free.furniture and fixture were old and cheap. door was very thin and I could hear everything in the hall. White furniture showed signs of age and wear. bathroom looked either trendy or a temporary structure.staff was friendly and helpful. food was excellent. sushi restaurant downstairs was very good (pricey, but I grew up in Japan, where sushi is like hamburgers, everyday food not cool food).there's plenty of light in the room, but everything else is darkly lit like a club.bed was comfortable. felt similar to sheratons' beds, not as plush as westin.location is great, right off times square, couldn't be better. i didn't get too much street noise in the room, but again, lots of hallway noise.for the same price, maybe a little less, go for the westin times square."
240,1991,"May 2 2007 	Great Stay at Trendy Hotel for 1st Anniversary	Absolutely wonderful service and satisfaction. My wife had stayed at several other W hotels and since I was planning a surprise trip for her to NYC for our 1st wedding anniversary, I thought the W Times Square would be a perfect fit. I got very lucky finding a promotion on the hotels website where if you bought two nights you would get a third for free, so even though the rooms were a little more expensive then what I wanted, it ended up being about the same as paying for three nights at a different hotel.The experience was amazing from the time we walked in the door. I had line up some special services through W's &quot;Whatever, Whenever&quot; service and it payed off bigtime. They had chocolate covered strawberries with wine in our room upon arrival. In addition they place rose pedals throughout the room and at my request with the help of the Whatever, Whenever service, they had a special song playing on the CD player when we arrived. The wife loved it. They also upgraded us to a nicer room on the 48th floor. This was a corner room with a view of Times Square and the Hudson River and unlike some of the other reviews, the noise from below was minimal. The bed was as advertised and the pillows were unbelievably comfortable. Our bathroom was small but nice and all of the products provided were great. Our room was spacious and very clean.The lobby of the hotel is very chic and trendy with low lights and a very busy bar. The entrance was cool with the waterfalls overhead and the staff was extremely nice. The hallway to our room was a bit dark as were the elevators but went with the hotels decor.The only part that we were disapointed with was our experience while eating at Blue Fin, the hotels upscale restaraunt. The food was mediocre at best and the portions were small, but the atmosphere and staff were great. We constantly visited the little store right next door that offered great food 24hrs a day and was a wonderful place to grab breakfast before heading out to sightsee in NYC.Overall the experience with the W was outstanding. I would reccomend it to anyone who is into modern decor and wonderful service."
241,1991,"Apr 28 2007 	Awesome View of Times Square	Awesome view. Great Hotel. Beautiful Water Feature in Lobby. Great Times Square Location. Walking distance to Broadway shows. Great Breakfast. Extremely comfortable bed, linens and pillows. Very clean. Pricey gift shop. Ultra modern but not too overdone. Very serene for the hustle and bustle on the square. Flat plasma tv. Impossible to figure out alarm clock/CD player. Bar very crowded &amp; trendy. Lobby &amp; check-in crowded due to location of the bar. No Gideon Bible."
242,1991,"Apr 21 2007 	Not Worth The Money	We had two rooms through American Express Corp. travel. Upon arrival,check in was ok but to get to your room was very exhausting. You haveto travel up to a certain floor exit the elevator and walk to anotherarea to get on another elevator to get to your room. We were given a regular room &amp; we were told that we were upgraded to a suite since it was available thru American Express at no additional charge. It was a non smoking room that had been smoked in. Their solution was toput this large box in our room to help the odor. The box was left in our room the whole time and was never picked up. It was suppose to bep/u in a few hours. The room was somewhat clean. Very contemp. For the price of the room we were very disappointed and not impressed. The location was good. We will try the Marriott Marquis Times Square next. I has a better location and much better rating with tripadvisor."
243,1991,"Apr 11 2007 	W is for Waste of Money	My colleagues and I have stayed at the W Times Square while covering the New York Auto Show every year for the past four years. I always knew that the W was more about style than substance, but my recent experience there assured that last week would be our last stay there.The rooms were okay, stylish but with beds that were way too small. The real problem came with the conference room we reserved at the hotel to use as a work base. They had promised a conference room with a T1 line where we could do post-production work. But when we got there, there was no internet line at all, and what they ultimately hooked up was no better than bad dial-up. The person arranging the room did not have a clue about internet connections, which would be fine in 1997, but not in 2007.And then, they lost the video deck that had been delivered to the hotel for us, so we were at a standstill for four hours. They did apologize but in an utterly lackluster way, like they were used to screwing up. The best they could do was offer some free food, which wasn't much comfort given that we had to stay up until 3 p.m. to make up for their mistake. And when all was said and done, they tried to charge us for &quot;package handling&quot; for the equipment they lost. And they acted like they were doing us a huge favor by not charging us for the room that we ultimately couldn't use. Now, if you are at a restaurant and they forget to bring the entree, are they doing you a favor by not charging you for it?Anyway, I did try to follow up with a manager by phone, but she never bothered to call me back after an initial conversation.Lesson: If you want silly style, think W. If you want employees who are on-the-ball and professional, you should probably look elsewhere."
244,1991,"Apr 10 2007 	Where is the Wow?	We did 5 nights here in Feb for a long weekend and were disappointed with some aspects of the W.The location is great to get out &amp; about from, there are a few subway stops nearby &amp; cabs right outside plus Times Square is just around the corner.I would say that most of the money has been spent on the communal areas &amp; the room we had left a lot to be desired. The entrance is very impressive with the waterfall that cascades over the glass ceiling is cool. The darker than dark lifts and bar area are uber cool too. We had a quick dance in the lifts inbetween each floor, on our own of course! It was all very Sex in the City stylee with a price tag to match. Your looking at around $12 a drink, which soon stacks up if you are thirsty &amp; want more than a glass of ice.We have stayed in NYC before &amp; are aware that space is at a premium so I wasn't expecting a big room. I was however hopeful of heating in the winter &amp; also a quiet room at night. There was a massive aircon unit in the corridor outside out room that clanked &amp; clunked all night long. The room itself was a little bit tired, considering this is referred to as 5 star, it isn't. There was a stain on the quilt, the bathroom had bits of mould on some of the grout &amp; was freezing to step out of the shower into. The bliss toiletries were nice &amp; were replenished every day. The gym has an assortment of free weights &amp; a couple of cardio machines, there are no showers/sauna or steam.I had a deep tissue massage while we stayed here &amp; felt the benefit the next day, in fact I'm still feeling it now after 7 weeks. I would recommend a trip to Michael if your back/shoulders are knotted, he put me through pain but it was worth it! They have heated massage beds, which was a first for me but v.nice.The restaurant has a good menu &amp; is worth a visit if you can't be bothered to venture too far. As someone else has mentioned, there is a deli about 2 doors up the road (going away from Times Square) and I would highly recommend it for coffee &amp; breakfast, cold drinks to put in the mini bar (the mini bar is a rip-off $12 for bottled water) and the selection of hot food etc is fantastic. If I had a deli like that in London I would stop shopping/cooking. If you carry on walking in the same direction across a couple of blocks you will end up at Hells Kitchen, there are loads of places to eat round here we tried the Chelsea Grill which had a nice vibe.I could go on &amp; on about the great places to eat in this big city, but thats for you to find out or have fun trying!Overall the W was ok, if I'd known how over-rated it is I would have booked something else."
245,1991,"Apr 10 2007 	12 Night Stay - Good W	I had a 12 night stay at the W Hotel - Times Square. In comparison to the other W in the City, this one is the better hotel. The lobby is new, the carpeting in the hallways clean, and the room overrall is modern, hip, and neat. Housekeeping and turndown service is inconsistent. On some nights they would come and on some nights they wouldn't. The food here is incredibiliy expensive, and why would anyone need to order room service in Time Square in beyond me. At night after 10pm all hotel guests require a key to enter, so security made you feel safe. On Thrus - Sat the hotel lobby is packed and very loud (full of twenty something drinking at the bar). One major complaint is that the front desk gave me the run around for upgrades using SPG pts. They told me to contact SPG telephone line but when I called, they told me to contact the front desk since I have already checked in. ... I gave up.the workout room is your standard W Hotel workout space... about 6 treadmills and a few machines. Enough for a quick workout. If you score a room on a high floor (goes up to 54th flr), there's a good chance you'll be able to see NJ, the hudson river, and the entire city.Internet service was $17 per 24 hr. or $6 for 30 min. Overrall this is your above average NYC W Hotel. In comparison to other hotels in the city within the price range, it is good."
246,1991,"Apr 4 2007	A Perfect New York W Weekend	I stayed at the W over a weekend and actually loved it. I had been to the hotel lobby bar for drinks and have admired how stylish it is. Staying at the hotel was even better. I booked a superior room which is a step above the basic &quot;wonderful&quot; room. The room was quite roomy with a partial view of Times Sq. There was an HD flat TV. As usual the bed and bathroom were high-grade Starwood quality. As with other Ws, the Bliss bathroom products are some of the best I have seen. As guests of the hotel, we didn't have to pay the $20 cover charge at the Whiskey club downstairs which was a nice extra (even though the club was on the cheesy side playing mainstream hip hop for a suburban looking crowd).So why 4 rather than 5 stars? Mostly it is an issue of price. The $450 price tag for a nice room - while OK for NYC these days - does not feel like great value. You could stay at a Four Seasons in Istanbul for this kind of money. But then again, as New Yorkers like to say, nothing compares to NYC. And no boutique chain compares to the consistent quality of the W."
247,1991,"Mar 29 2007 	Loved the atmosphere	The Hotel's location was grt, the room was small but beautiful,made you feel like you were in a spa. Loved the lobby, the water feature was beautiful. The gym was pretty good, had a grt view while you worked out,and the equipment was new and well kept. Friendly staff, had a great stay..."
248,1991,"Mar 11 2007	Too much effort on OUR part...	First, for a NY hotel, the price was right. The room was clean. Scents are used on the rugs,etc. when cleaning which could cause those with allergies to have some problems..I requested that the spray not be use in our room. The location, on Times Square, was wonderful. Problems came up when then sun set....the exterior hotel lights, glaring directly into our upgraded, 36th floor corner room made it seem as if it were still daylight...and the bank of 12+ floodlights stayed on ALL night!. Walls are paper thin..so if noise and outside sound are problematic for you...better to stay elsewhere.Room proportions are miniscule and austere..gray is the color of the day. Check in was easy and friendly, but the promised wine (to celebrate a special occassion) and the turn down service and special 'amenity' were nowhere to be found. Concerns were noted and staff did bring a bottle of wine, albeit the wrong kind. For my money, we will try another hotel next time...this one was just too much work!"
249,1991,"Mar 7 2007 	Loved It!	Me and my husband booked this hotel for my 40th Birthday treat! We trawled the internet wanting to stay in a nice, central, comfortable hotel as it was a special occasion and the W Hotel did not disappoint! We stayed in one of the Spectacular rooms as all the Wonderful rooms were booked. I emailed the hotel and asked for a nice room as it was my 40th and when we checked in we found ourselves up on the 56th floor with great views of Broadway right up to Central Park! The room was spacious (which we were not expecting) with the comfiest bed I have ever slept in! In fact, to say we were in the City that never sleeps, we slept better than we do at home - it was delightful! On our first night, a complimentary birthday cake was delivered to our door, which was a lovely touch. The rooms are cleverly designed and yes, they may not be overly plush, but they are done really well. The walk in shower was fab and the complimentary Bliss products each day were great! The hotel bar is very cool and I felt very &quot;Sex in the City&quot; drinking my Cosmopolitan!! I would definitely recommend the W Hotel, we thought it was fantastic!"
250,1991,"Mar 4 2007 	Nice stay.	This was my second visit to W Times Square. I was disappointed with my first (about a year ago). But I am all for second chances. This time, they came through with flying colors. The staff was much friendlier, the room was not the size of a closet. My only complaint... I had a corner room with a SE view... there was construction happening on the roof of an adjacent bldg. Very unsightly, but not the Ws fault."
251,1991,"Mar 3 2007 	Seems to be for businessmen/designed by men?	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for one night. We liked certain things about it such as the cool waterfall effect as you walk in, the bed was comfortable, the large HDTV was great, the elevators were good, and the staff and service was attentive. Check-in and check-out were done very expeditiously. The room was clean, and plenty of plush towels were provided.We asked for a wakeup call and received it on time. We ordered breakfast to be delivered to the room at 8 AM, and our order arrived a few minutes early and was perfect. The food was quite good. What I did not like was that this hotel seemed to be designed for the business traveler, and I thought the room was not female friendly. We were there to attend a big family party. I was rather taken aback to find that, although the bathroom was rather large, there was a lot of wasted space in it. It needed more hooks and shelves. The thing that bothered me the most was that the sink had almost no room to spread out my makeup items for application, there was a makeup mirror but it was mounted way too high for a woman who is, like me, average height (5'4&quot;), and the lighting in the bathroom was way too dim to see what I was doing! They provide nice, plush bathrobes, found in the closet, but there was no hook to hang it up in the bathroom. (The bathroom had a pocket door instead of a regular door.) The room itself had several lights, but all of the lights were dim. We find that to be very annoying. The room was very small, hardly larger than the king-sized bed, with decor that was kind of austere and high-tech, not at all comfortable or homey. There were 2 chairs in the room, but neither one was comfortable. Our room was obviously designed for very short stays! We never would have wanted to stay in that room for more than the one night. The decor gave us an uneasy, edgy feel instead of the relaxing effect we had been needing &amp; hoping for. We heard a LOT of noise from the hallways late at night. A drawerful of snacks is in the room; I had to stop my husband from taking any because he did not realize that we would be charged for them....he thought they were included in the price of the room! No way! A plus is that right next door there is a nice deli with all kinds of food, snacks, sandwiches and drinks available. I had a roast beef sandwich from that deli and it was great! The bottom line is that we would not stay here again due to the negatives that I mentioned.."
252,1991,"Feb 21 2007 	Classy Hotel	Just back from Stay in The W, Times Square, it is a classy hotel, with great service and very central. The rooms were very comfortable, lovely beds. Would definitely recommend it to anyone, will stay again next visit to New York. The Staff were very helpful and friendly!"
253,1991,"Feb 8 2007 	Cool Sophistication	I just joined Trip advisor and I am finally writing my reviews.....we stayed at W in Dec 2005. This hotel is so hip I feel like I was 28 agan, it is not cheap but the location is amazing. We had a corner view watching the big New Year's Eve celebration. It was my wife''s 40th and they really made it special for her. The place is minimalist and the service was great.. They did not get over the tip like other hotels but you still felt special. If you don;t like loud music or dark corridors, this is the wrong place for you. But to feel young again, definitely worth it. The lobby is fun, just to hang around and sit in one of the comfortable square seats. The rom was very clean and again, minimal but useful. I love the bathroom and the modern design. I will definitely stay there again."
254,1991,"Feb 5 2007 	W stands for what is up w/ this hotel?	This hotel was like a cross between a nightclub and a college dorm. All of the lighting in the hotel was either fluorescent or neon, walls painted black, club music pumping 24/7- hence, the comparison to a nightclub. The actual room we stayed in truly looked like a dorm room w/ a king sized bed. Furniture was sparse and not well made, with the exception of the bed which was quite comfortable. The bathroom was tiny w/ a shower only, a shower which was not enclosed I might add, which led to a wet, messy bathroom floor. WIth the W, I expected minimalistic but serene luxury. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed w/ this location."
255,1991,"Feb 4 2007 	The emperor has no clothes	I kept hearing about Starwood's hip W brand hotels, and decided to try one out on a trip to Manhattan. This place was a major disappointment--haughty, unfriendly (but really beautiful) front-desk staff; dim-almost-dark hallways and elevators; and a room that smelled strongly of mildew, as if the carpet had been washed and never properly dried out. When we waited for the elevator to go down to the lobby in the morning, the elevator door opened on a guy and two girls still wearing their clubbing togs from the night before practically doing the nasty. My husband and I figured out right then that we are clearly outside the W demographic...we won't be back."
256,1991,"Jan 30 2007 	Wonderful hotel	I booked the W Times Square for a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend's 30th. Got a good room rate on Expedia but was slightly concerned about some of the reviews on tripadvisor - however, I needn't have worried at all - the hotel was everything we could have hoped and more. Staff were super-friendly and went out of their way to be helpful throughout our stay and the hotel is incredibly stylish and brilliantly located in the middle of all the action. I contacted the hotel a few weeks before our stay to organise a birthday cake to be delivered to us on arrival as a surprise - the cake arrived right on time and was exactly what I wanted. I also asked for a room with a view of Times Square and not only did the hotel oblige but we were upgraded to a corner room with stunning views. The room was spotless and stylish and the bathroom was lovely, with gorgeous Bliss Spa products. We only visited The Living Room during our stay and not the Whiskey Bar but we absolutely loved the Living Room and the cocktails were top-notch (much better value than in any comparable bar in London too!). Had breakfast on our first day in Blue Fin and were v. impressed with the food and service.In summary, the hotel was a gem and we wouldn't hesitate to go back. Highly recommended!"
257,1991,"Jan 29 2007 	thrilled with the W!	From the minute we walked into the foyer on the 7th floor(entrance thru an enclosed glass waterfall at ground level), we knew we'd enjoy our stay.The room was contemporary with a view of Broadway , a small bathroom but whatever the room lacked in space, the staff made up for it with excellent service. Also the food was top class.Our stay was to celebrate a special birthday and the prebooked surprises thru the 'Whatever,Whenever' service went to plan.The door staff were great too.Would definately stay again"
258,1991,"Jan 26 2007 	W Times Square	We have just returned from our second stay at the W Times Square. The first stay was outstanding and the second just as good. Staff can not do enough to help, the atmosphere is electric and the food is of a very high standard.After staying at this hotel last August, it has made every hotel I've stayed at since look very boring. The room decor is very modern and clean. The Bliss products smell beautiful (lemon and sage) and the maids always stock the room every day. The dark corridors mentioned in other reviews are correct but it just adds to the atmosphere of the place.I would recommend this hotel to anyone and will stay here every time I come to New York."
259,1991,"Jan 16 2007 	incredible hotel	I was very impressed with this hotel. The service was wonderful- everyone was friendly and helpful. Employees were willing to take the time to give us helpful advice on restaurants, etc.The rooms were impeccable. Everything looked very new and had a modern flair. This is the nicest place I have stayed in New York (I have also stayed at the Renaissance Times Square.) The size of the room was quite adequate- we had space to move around. I was able to request a room with a view- we had a view of Broadway below. I was also able to request a room with a bathtub- most of the rooms here only have showers.There was only one chair in the room- at the desk. This presented a small problem when we ordered room service because one of us had to sit on the bed and the other in the chair and eat at the table provided with the room service. We were in a bit of a hurry but I am sure they would have provided a chair if we had time to request one.The rooms were elegant and a soft cd is playing when you walk in, and plays constantly throughout your stay (there is a cd player.)The hotel also hosts a restaurant- the blue fin- which was also impressive. The atmosphere was like a los angeles scene but also very relaxing. The food was incredible. I ordered the filet mignon, medium well. It came out perfect. I often have problems with medium well steaks in even five star restaurants, but not here. Every portion of the meal was wonderful- down to the dessert. Much thought went into the preparation and creation of each course. The Whiskey Nite Club is also in the hotel. Even on Sunday, this place was a place to be. It has a unique atmosphere and a vip section one can reserve for parties. The music is basically top 40 dance music, with not much variation. It was worth checking out. There are not many seats there, so be prepared to stand. There is a coat check for $2 per coat. As for some other things about the hotel- it is in a great location. The valet parking was worth it, but was expensive- $62 per night. It goes on a 24 hour basis- so if you arrive before check in, you can still check your car and have until the same time the next day to get it back. However, there are no in-out privileges with the car. The room-service breakfast was good quality as well. It was expensive- we paid close to $100 for breakfast, and each only had one basic meal with only one extra juice and one extra order of bacon. That included the tip.We had a slight problem with the bill- we were charged for an umbrella from the mini-bar that we didn't take. A short call to the hotel remedied this immediately.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in New York. You can't beat the accommodations, the staff, the luxury, the location, and the atmosphere. After coming to this hotel, we will probably always stay here when coming to New York.We will also check out other W hotels worldwide when traveling other places!"
260,1991,"Jan 13 2007 	Pretty Bad	Once again I went with an American Express &quot;Fine Hotel&quot; - and once again dissapointed.Firstly, I believe I read their website, and about how they're all about the linens and beds... I don't know if I've slept on such a horrible, hard, uncomfortable bed! I don't have exceptionally high standards when it comes to beds, but this was just rock hard.The room was OK, stained carpet, torn furniture, etc. It was clean, and it had everything you needed, so if you don't mind those little things, then no big deal.We were on the 37th floor, and the traffic was still quite loud. If it bothers you, I'd request a higher floor. The 37th Floor was not quite high enough to avoid the flashy billboards (er, video screens) from Times Sq.As to Location, fantastic. You're right there, in the middle of it all, and I'd recommend it for young couples/singles, but I wouldn't recommend it for families.Check-in/reception is actually on Level 7 - You take the elevators up to Level 7 (every time), and from there you take your designated elevator to your floor.Food was good, but certainly not worth the expense, and well, you're in NYC - get out there and hit one of the many, MANY fabulous restaurants.I would recommend any of my single friends to stay, but I've actually stayed at The Time, a couple of years ago, and I would recommend that first. It's also in the mix (just off Times Sq), and is quiet, well appointed, and friendly.Speaking with Concierge, and Reception is extremely difficult as afternoon turns to evening. They're right in-front of the bar, in an wide-open hard-walled area. I found it rather unpleasant coming back from a full day in the city, and having all that noise to deal with in the 'lobby' of my hotel.My final thoughts - too expensive for what you get, unless you have money to burn, I'm sure there are better options (including The Time)."
261,1991,"Jan 10 2007 	This hotel provides a life changing experience	What can I say? Love NYC and this is the best yet. This is our 3rd vist from the UK to NYC and I can't see any mid priced accomodation getting better than this. Let me spell it out. Room rate was excellent, and on arrival asked about the possibility of a free upgrade to a corner room and was granted my wish - was not a problem at all. Was very pleased and for no extra charge. Mentioned at check in that it was my wife's 30th and in the time it took us to have a brief drink in the bar before our baggage was taken to our room, complimentary champagne and chocolate strawberries had been delivered to our suite. I was delighted at this attention to detail and swift thought and practice - excellent customer service.We recieved nothing than top quality service from every member of staff at this establishment. I recommend this hotel with my word, and on that you have a promise. With my word in mind, there were just some minor points that did cross my mind - and that is all they did. Although we had a room on the corner block facing Times Square, I wondered what value and view would be offered by accomodation at the back of the hotel.The Ice machines were noisy - and I mean noisy. Not a problem for us at all but those poor peeps in the two rooms in between the ice generator must have been cursing....Drinks are expensive - and I mean expensive. I don't mind shelling out for ambience but $44 and tip for 2 glasses of wine and a sprite did make me wonder. However - this is class. From start to finish. Already looking at the photos and the memories are already bringing a lump to my throat - 2 days after we have got back to the UK.Trust me - this is an experience, and for the persons looking for a more trendy, relaxed and informal but edged stay, this is perfect. Thanks to all at the W at Times Square - We truly loved our stay."
262,1991,"Jan 5 2007 	Less than Expected	We just returned from fabulous trip in NYC for New Year's Eve! Knowing how much in demand it would be, we booked the W Times Square 10 months in advance to ensure a great room.Here are the details:Hotel: Perfect Location. If you want something traditional, stay at Waldolf Estoria. The W is very trendy and 'outside the box'. As you enter the hotel, look up and there is a water glass ceiling, quite remarkable. Everything is very dark and you always feel like you're in a maze because you go from one elevator to another to get where you're going.Check-In: Pretty smooth &amp; friendly. The lobby is great, dark and loud like a cool lounge/club. When we had originally booked, we were assured by the GM we would get an upgraded room high floor room with a view of times square. When we arrived, they had given all those rooms away, so we were left without a view. The entire purpose of staying at the W was to get a great view of the crowds. This was very disappointing. Room: We had an upgrade to the standard rooms (I think they call them 'cool'). Again, modern design but our room needed love. There were many signs of wear and tear and no signs of upkeep. The rooms are fairly small but very different design from other hotels. Had it been very well maintained, it has wow-potential.Service: Great. Everyone is very laid back and helpful, kind of like a great neighbor. Probably the best part of the hotel. Food: We ordered breakfast for Jan 1. Nothing spectacular, pretty basic bacon and eggs but we paid about 5 times what we would've had we walked to the nearest breakfast place.Gym: They claim the W has the best gym. Not the best, but definitely great. Individual tvs on all machines, they provide purified water, towels, earphones, fruit and a lovely view of times square.All in all, would we go again? Several of the staff did mention they were undergoing renovations in the rooms (much needed) in the new year. After that, we'd go again. We expected more for such a reputable brand."
263,1991,"Jan 5 2007 	Loved it baby!	I stayed here back in Dec 05 but only just signed up to do reviews. We have been to NY every year for the past 8. The W was our favourite hotel yet. We have previously stayed at Essex House, The Bentley, The Edison and Portland Square. We had a fantastic room on a high floor on the corner overlooking the Square. The room was cool and the bar even cooler! The place is really trendy and modern and we loved it. Sink a few cocktails and you are guaranteed a wonderful time. Can't wait to return."
264,1991,"Dec 26 2006 	Very cool	What a cool hotel! Check in was super fast! Its a sleek reception area next to an ultra modern bar called the living room. The room was spectacular. Great view, unique furniture! The westin bed was super comfortable.Flat panel plasma tv. One of the best showers ever. The bath products were first rate. Everyone that worked at the hotel was firendly and helpful. I will stay at this hotel again soon!"
265,1991,"Dec 23 2006	Wonderful Stay!	I stay at a lot of hotels and I RARELY designate an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating as I feel that there is always room for improvement. However, I think that the W TImes Square has it right.The hotel itself is in the perfect location. Close to many midtown office buildings and smack in the middle of Times Square with great views (from certain rooms) of the &quot;crossroads of the world&quot;.The staff could not be more friendly. It is so nice to encounter staff members at an upscale hotel that do not act stuffy and better than everyone else. I had fun with one of the doormen picking on some of the more stuffy guests as they walked into the hotel.The bell staff is wonderful, the front desk assigned us the perfect rooms and even made the extra effort to get them adjoining which only took an extra hour past check-in time and even called me on my cell phone to let me know the room was ready.I came back to my room to find a welcome amenitiy of wine and fruit and was just made to feel welcome in every aspect of my stay. This hotel is fantastic and well-worth the room rate. I hope that in choosing this hotel, other travelers will have the same positive experience as I did."
266,1991,"Dec 17 2006 	Incredibly Hip hotel	I've never been to a W hotel before so this two night stay @ The W Hotel Times Square was nothing I could've imagined. The location is great but if you like quiet places, don't try Times Square obviously but it was fine for me. The lobby is great and check-in was one of the fastest i've ever seen. The corridors are very dark like other customers wrote on their reviews but once you get into your room, is spectacular. We had a room on the 50th floor with a great view on times square and even if the room wasn't very big, we had enought place for two.Glass desk with broadband access and HD LCD TV on the wall was very nice for me who wanted to work for a couple hours every night. Anyway, we paid 500$ for a night and even if it's a bit expensive, the hotel is awesome and i'll definitely go back there when i'm back in NEw York."
267,1991,"Nov 28 2006 	Very good choice	Stayed only one night here, due to our limited time in NYC, but was happy with my choice. The location is in the middle of Times Square, with the entrance on a side street. We had a corner room in the back, so it was very quiet. The elevators took a few minutes to figure out, but otherwise they were fine. You need your room key to operate the elevators and make them go up to the rooms, which is good security. The room was clean and comfy. The bathroom was fine except for needing a little grout cleaning. We did not hear noises through the bathroom walls as others did. The lobby is hip and trendy -although too young for my tastes. My only suggestion is to brighten up the hallways as they are too dark. I know they want atmosphere, but I would have preferred more light."
268,1991,"Nov 24 2006 	Hip great hotel with beautiful people abound!	Where to begin? This is by far one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It has raised my expectations of what a hotel should be like.To make a long story short when we checked in,there was a small mixup because another guest in the hotel had the same last name. The problem was quickly resolved and we were put in another room. Two phone calls later apologizing for the mixup, we were told that we would be moved to suite the next day. An executive suite on Times Square???!!! Yeah, that would do. To top it off, the devestatingly handsome man than checked us in sent complimentary fruit and champagne to our room. The W definitely made us feel like we were on vacation, VIP style!Even the concierge was great in giving us suggestions for dinner/lunch places, and any other questions we had. They even printed out our boarding passes so we wouldn't have to wait at the airport. The Lounge was always happening and the hotel was in the middle of everything. I went with 3 other friends and we had a blast. I could see how this wouldn't be a family hotel, but for us being in our late 20s-early 30s.....it rocked!! The Whiskey had good music, but the crowd was a bit sketchy. Walk a little out of the Times Square vicinity for better food choices, don't get sucked into the tourist trap of Olive Garden, TGIF, and Applebees! Upon returning to Texas, I realized I had misplaced my bluetooth headset. I sent an email to the hotel, which was replied to the next day saying that it had been found in our suite. To my delight, I received it the next day, free of charge. I honestly couldn't have asked for more from a hotel. I have travel frequently, but have yet to encounter a hotel with such great customer service as The W, especially the W in Times Square. I came back to Houston raving about the hotel, I don't think we could ever stay anywhere else...we got too spoiled!"
269,1991,"Nov 21 2006	Nice rooms great location	Stayed there 4 nights before departing for Italy. Room very comfortable, bed great. Location excellent, plenty of restaurants, in between Times Sq. and Ninth Avenue. Was not at all noisy and lobby quiet. We did not experience what the other reviewer did. Only minor complaint would be that the hotel too accessible from the outside with so many exits and entrances and no one guarding or checking."
270,1991,"Nov 19 2006 	In need of rennovation and overpriced	We stayed at the W from 10 - 13 Nov as a few days sight seeing prior to the start of a business trip. We booked a &quot;Fabulous&quot; corner room for $539 per night less taxes, which turned out to be far from it's description although it was on a corner. The room was in dire need of decoration, drab and small. The bathroom was mouldy and had a strange smell. Directly outside our room was an ice machine which made a terrible crashing noise every 10 minutes and leaked the whole time we were there. We reported this twice as the carpet outside our room was drenched. Unfortunately we had a connecting door to the room next to ours which meant we got to hear ALL of the 4am - 7am party the occupant decided to have with his mates on Saturday morning. We did complain to the hotel the next morning and were given a 50% discount for that night's stay but were not convinced that the occupant was properly dealt with. The Blue Fin restuarant offers great food and the bar area is very trendy but, for that reason, very busy. The concierge was helpful in recommending restuarants and advice on how to get around. In all we would not choose to stay here again and did not feel that we were really getting value of money. If you can afford these rates then there are better alternatives."
271,1991,"Nov 16 2006 	Loved the W Times Square	We booked The W for a girls weekend hitting concerts, theatre, and shopping . We come up several times a year for both business and pleasure and are quite at home here. Was a little concerned about staying right in the heart of Times Square (touristy, crowded) as we usually stay down in Soho. But we got a great deal through Starwood so decided to check it out. I'm glad we did.From the moment we arrived, great, great service. The bell staff was attentive and polite the whole stay. The front desk was wonderful, even with a busy lobby of people checking out all at once. We arrived 6 hours before official check-in simply hoping to stow our luggage. They asked us to wait in the Living Room where we surfed the free wi-fi while they coordinated with the cleaning staff to have our room ready as quickly as possible. We couldn't believe it when they came to get us in less than an hour.The room was definitely NYC small. Almost too small. And the bathroom was a tight fit. But the furnishings were chic and the beds incredibly, incredibly comfy, the amenties top notch and the view spectacular. The hallways were a bit dim but never a serious problem. Someone had mentioned earlier about the confusion over the elevators. I'm not sure why since it only took one time for the staff to show us the details and even when coming in late at night with a few cocktails under our belts, we zipped up to our rooms without getting lost.The Living Room in the p.m. was a blast. Lot of people and good music. We ended up talking to a group of people at the bar who turned out to be a favorite band of ours. Small world. Drinks are a bit pricey but no surprise in NYC. Bar service started out great but by the end of the evening the bartenders were obviously just phoning it in and preferred to chat amongst themselves rather than take drink orders or ring up tabs.Whether you stay here or not, you MUST eat at the Blue Fin in the hotel. EXCELLENT seafood and sushi-very fresh. (We are from a coastal area and are very picky about our seafood.) Service was fantastic and the scene was great for people watching. We had a dinner and two lunches there and were never disappointed. Don't miss it.Maid service was efficient. They came a bit early one morning though in their defense we forgot our do not disturb sign. Once we put that up we weren't bothered at all. And our room was clean when we returned from shopping later that day.The Club downstairs was ok-crowded, music not to our liking but we really didn't spend much time there. Make sure you have a full wallet. A round of shots can set you back serious money.Check out was slower than check-in. The guy seemed new and made several mistakes. But as always, attentive, professional and very nice and very genuine. We never got an attitude from anyone there except a little from the bartender that one late nite.In a nutshell, we'd go back again due to the great service, the incredible beds and the Blue Fin. Weaknesses would have to be the location and the tight room. We really prefer Soho/Village."
272,1991,"Nov 14 2006 	What ever When ever - that is this hotels moto and they exceeded it !!!	My family and I have just returned from a weeks stay at the W hotel in Times Square and in a word it was - Fantastic.The staff were very friendly at check in and we were given magnificent corner rooms on the 46th and 47th floors - the views were spectacular !The rooms were very comfortable - wonderful power showers in glass enclosed wet room, as many toiletries as you required were left every day together with blissfully soft towels.The bed was so comfortable -if it hadn't been for all of the exciting sights to be seen in the BIG APPLE we would have been more than happy to lie in.This is our 3rd visit and have stayed in various locations from Wall Street to Central Park but without a doubt this was the best yet.The deli to the left of the hotel is great for breakfast.Also the World Cruise at night from pier 81 complete with dinner was excellent."
273,1991,"Nov 11 2006 	W stands for WORST	Bring a flashlight, bottled water and ear plugs. The joint is tragically hip -ultra dark common spaces, blasting rock &amp; roll in the check in area. 6 oz bottle of water is $8, (note, there is no price on it., guess that wouldn't be very hip.)A very unpleasant place to stay especially if you have been traveling half a day and are on a business trip. Great place to stay if you are 18 - 22 years old and want to feel like you are on a bum drug trip."
274,1991,"Nov 6 2006 	NOT all that is cracked up to be	We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. While we were in NY for business, we wanted to stay in a location where we could take in being &quot;tourists&quot; in the evenings after work. It took us several weeks trying to find the right hotel (since there are SO MANY in NY and can be overwhelming to choose), and this one came recommended. Our first impression of the hotel was cool, hip &amp; trendy. We're in our 30's and, being in the fashion industry, we felt this was a very unique hotel and felt right at home....UNTIL......we realized that the hotel is all &quot;hype&quot;, and no substance! The rooms were small, but that's expected being that it's NY. But what really got to us was the PAPER THIN WALLS...even the walls WITHIN the room (ie. walls / doors to the bathroom). The door to the bathroom is like one of those japanese paper-made sliding doors that doesn't even close all the way so you literally have no privacy whatsoever. We could hear EVERYTHING that was going on next door on both sides of our room. Conversations (at normal talking level..in other words, they weren't talking loud or yelling), TV, the water running...even VERY PERSONAL situations if you know what I mean. It was very difficult to sleep at night!Other frustrating things about this hotel: the hallways are pitch black w/ these funky blue lights or some other dim color lights; You have to take 2 elevators to get to your room; We needed assistance from the bellman 4 times during our stay, and each time (and I'm not exxagerating), we had to wait at least 10 minutes to get someone to help us; and when they did finally come to help us, they acted like we were bothering them! One of us in our group even tried to get one of the bellman's attention and the bellman walked away to a room and slammed the door on our face!! Lastly, the guys outside helping you to get cabs NEVER greeted us unless there was a door they could open or some way they could get a tip from us.... It was disgusting. Positive point: the staff that worked at the check-in counter were all extremely helpful &amp; courteous! Whenever we needed help with our room key, or with Fed Ex mail, or even needing an umbrella (it started pouring outside on 1 day)...they went out of their way to assist us promptly. So kudos to them! They made our stay bearable. But overall, what I initially thought was a cool, friendly &amp; service-oriented hotel, turned out to be so not what I expected! The W / Times Square Hotel just comes in a &quot;pretty package&quot; w/ great marketing...but the service overall is not acceptable and the quality of the hotel is mediocre. Frankly, I think they try WAY too hard to be trendy....that they forget that all their guests want is to be comfortable, feel pampered....&amp; feel right at home. For us, it was actually &quot;work&quot; to stay at this hotel and NOT very comfortable at all! We will never come back to this hotel."
275,1991,Nov 4 2006	Great location - hotel is okay	I stayed here before and returned because we had a great view from our room. We did not have a great view from our room this time and we were not told of any extras. The rooms are small but they are nice. The location is outstanding but I can do without the W attitude. The staff really do believe they are doing you a favor by doing their job which is kind of disappointing. My second visit to this hotel was a substantial drop off in quality of service and attention to detail from my first visit. In the end it was nothing special which was kind of a letdown after such a positive first visit.
276,1991,"Oct 31 2006	OK hotel but service is terrible	Nice enough rooms, ok hotel but everything there costs a fortune (someone else has commented on the $49 croissants!) and $17 a day for internet access in the room.Service was dreadful, maids ignored do not disturb signs, concierge was never there and getting a taxi out of the doorman was near to impossible.Not sure I would return in a hurry - there are other hotels which are just as nice for the money."
277,1991,"Oct 28 2006 	Oh Good Grief; not impressed	I'm only 40 and trendy, but this hotel is ridiculous. The bar and restaurants are good, but you should visit those without staying here. The rooms are miniscule despite the descriptions of &quot;fabulous / spectacular&quot;, and the elevators are insanely slow, although you do make friends with strangers sharing frustration over the wait. The beds are comfortable and the Bliss spa products nice, but not enough to make up for the price and the fact that everything is &quot;tries too hard&quot; trendy, from the room service menu (bound like a stack of paint color samples) to the overly friendly staff with a &quot;whatever whenever policy&quot; that means &quot;good marketing, but you really can't get what you want when you want it, especially if you want quick room service or an elevator. &quot; Meeting rooms are too dark; food is very good."
278,1991,"Oct 26 2006 	Great Location Pity about the Room	We stayed for 5 days on business.Unfortunatly the room we were given was opposite the lift - thankfully I still had my earplugs!.Included in the rate was a &quot;breakfast&quot; that would have cost $49 a day - a LOT of money for a muffin, toast and a glass of juice!.Staff were standoffish and the bathroom &quot;walls&quot; well pieces of corrogated plastic were a little thin for my liking. The Bliss toiletries were nice, and the food at the seafood restraunt on Street Level was excellent."
