30,616,"May 4 2008 	Goodf hotel for category	A very good hotel in central area of London. Very clean, a large and comfortable bad, room large enough, friendly staff. Breakfast is good. London, in the morning rush, is a noisy city but the hotel rooms are well isolated even the front street rooms are OK. Hotel is near London Tower and London Bridge (2 minutes walk). Tower Hill underground station is there and you can go everywhere in Central Area of London in few minutes. When I return in London of course I will stay there."
31,616,"Apr 29 2008 	Fantastic Hotel.	We have just had a fantastic weekend away in London.It was my 2nd Visit to the Chamberlain and it was just as fantastic as the first stay I had.The reception area is great, all the staff were very friendly and helpfull and we did request our room to be ready for 11-00 and yes we did arrive at 11.00 and the room was ready.How fantastic is that, it meant we could unpack and freshen up and go and see off for our visit to the houses of parliment which again I recommend to you all.Our room was lovely and also so quiet.Breakfast is great and the dining room had been redecorated and was nice before but even nicer this time.It also great that for a London Hotel check out time is 11-00.I cant fault the place its so handy for buses, and tube.Also recommend for anyone going to london order your Oyster card before you go and that is so handy for using around London and cheaper of course.The surrounding area was different this time because I went for 2 nights this time the area on Friday night was busy, not rowdy had a good atmopshere. Then come Saturday completely different everything was closed so was extra quiet.Cant wait to go back it wont be very long.Great value for money for Weekend rates."
32,616,"Apr 5 2008 	Excellent service	I go to London on a regular basis and I must say that this is the best hotel I've stayed at in this price range. The room was clean , quiet and comfortabe and I have rarely come across such professional, friendly service! The only minus is the area on a weekend as most places are shut for business (the hotel is in the financial district of London) but the tube station is nearby so not a big problem. However, more and more places seem to stay open for the tourist in the City these days so you won't be totally stuck for places to eat/ drink. Liverpool street station is very close. Highly recommended!!!"
33,616,"Mar 31 2008 	An enjoyable stay	My partner and I stayed at this hotel for one night, at the weekend. I thought it was very good value for money - having got a deal for bed and breakfast for 80. Normally, the rates are much higher and do not include breakfast, so felt we did very well!The hotel was nice, the staff very polite, and the rooms clean. Breakfast was a continental buffet, which was tasty. The only downsides I felt were the fact that not all the channels worked on the television, and the much-hyped tv in the bathroom didn't work. This wasn't too much of an issue for us as we were only there the one night and went out, but if we had been looking to stay in and relax, I would have felt cheated. All in all, I enjoyed my stay. I would not, however, pay full weekday prices that don't include breakfast."
34,616,"Feb 26 2008 	very good	very clean hotel ,helpfull staff ,only one minute from aldgate tube station,food good,b&amp;b only 190 for fri/sat"
35,616,"Jan 10 2008 	Brilliant small hotel	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for a blissful two nights last week.It was easy enough to find (although the area wasn't one that I was familiar with). Also, it's only 5-6 stops away from Westminster on the underground, so perfect for those travelling into the heart of the city.We were greeted at reception by friendly and efficient staff, who didn't bat an eyelid at our request to check in 3 hours early.The room was spacious, well furnished and clean. The much vaunted television in the bathroom was in full working order and the only complaint I could make is that some of the hotel furnishings are a little dated (while well maintained!) Great choice of TV channels for those with kids, or those tired after a day of exploring Very quiet for London and slept well.Our rate included free continental breakfast, which was tasty if unimaginative and was served by very friendly staff.Much better than most hotels in London, even those with and extra star and a steeper price!"
36,616,"Dec 30 2007 	Great find	This was a surprisingly good place for a night in the City. Room was bigger than most City hotels, nicely appointed and with a lovely bathroom. No complaints at all, and the added benefit of being able to park right outside if you stay on a Sunday as we did."
37,616,"Nov 30 2007 	Fantastic Weekend Rates	This hotel offers fantastic weekend rates (65GBP for a regular room, 75GPB for a deluxe room). In addition, they include a full English breakfast (including a continental buffet) on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday mornings in the room price. The rates during the week are in the 200GBP range, and it definitely felt like we were getting a MUCH nicer room for a very cheap price (this IS London after all - 75GBP will only get you into an IBIS here with no free breakfast).We made our reservation on the hotel website 2 hours before arriving. When we got there they didn't have a copy of it yet (I'm assuming it gets faxed from a central office as they checked the fax machine) but went ahead and gave me a room at the rate shown on the printout I'd brought. (Take a printout of your internet reservation with you - ALWAYS, to any hotel - to make sure you get the rate shown on the web.)We went ahead and paid for the deluxe room which was very nice. No additional charge for our infant daughter to share our room. No view to speak of - the building next door - but we don't spend much time in our hotel room during the day to enjoy the view anyway. We were in room 101. Nice electronic room temperature controls. Funny little TV screen in the bathroom so you can watch TV from the tub! The room had a tub AND separate walk-in shower, heated towel rail, and nice bathroom amenities (i.e. soaps). Breakfast was great - they don't officially start until 7am but around 6:45 when we came downstairs they went ahead and got us coffee and some toast while they were getting everything set out. Nice continental layout - meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, croissants, etc. My husband had a full English Breakfast and I had porridge, all included in the weekend breakfast thing. Easy access to Tower Hill and Aldgate tube stations, as well as Tower Gateway DLR. We drove into the city and parked at Thomas More NCP car park (good weekend rates - around 8GBP per day) then walked the 10 minutes or so to the hotel. No problems leaving our luggage the entire next day after check-out."
38,616,"Oct 9 2007 	keeps authorisation money still locked	I was quite positive on this hotel, even after they had removed the extended mirror in the bathroom without any reason. I just asked them to return it back if possible.I stayed at the hotel from 23-Sep-2007 till 28-Sep-2007. I wouldn't say it is a perfect hotel, for the 4star rank it could be better of course. But as a unpretentious person I felt everything was okay till now. Today is 09-Oct-2007, more than 10 days from my departure from this hotel and the money on my card that had been blocked during the authorisation procedure are still being blocked. I have made already 3 times to the hotel. At first call there was a young man telling me he is busy and advising me to call later. Second time another man answered he was working for his second day in the hotel and didn't know how to unlock the card. And the third time the lady has transferred me to the reservation department, the member of which told me she couldn't find any records on me and asked me to send her email with details of my full name, dates of arrival and departure and the number of the credit card. I have written them all details apart from credit card number of course. I fain this ridiculous, she could have asked for the security 3-digit number as well. But I am still there with my credit card being locked and noon still contacted me from the hotel."
39,616,"Oct 8 2007 	Brillant Brillant Brillant	We stayed for 1 night as part of a wonderful surprise weekend arranged by my husband for my birthday.We have stayed in bigger hotels in London, which have lovely reception areas's, but the rooms have been just ordinary.Not the case with the chamberlain.As soon as you walk in the hotel, everything is spotlessly clean, and very warm and inviting. Beautiful fresh flower arrangements are in abudance throughout the hotel. The carpets were lovely and thick and of high quality.The receptionist was exceptable, even remembering our name the next day when checking out.Upon walking into our rooms, we instantly knew that we had choosen the right hotel. They were just beautiful, even down to the little details. Gorgeous High Quality furnishings and bedding and having the Plasma TV screen in the bathroom completed our wonderful experience of staying at this hotel.We are sure that anyone staying at this hotel will not be disappointed, and we would recommend anyone else to stay here.It is literally 3-4 min walk to Tower Of London, which is beautiful when all lit up on an evening....."
40,616,"Oct 5 2007	Great service	The best thing about our stay in The Chamberlain Hotel was the treatment. In a hotel you usually get EITHER good facilities, location, price or service but in The Chamberlain Hotel we found all three. We stayed for three nights and the staff were always friendly and willing to help, nothing was too much, even local information such as transport, if they didnt know something they find out. So all in all right down to the little touches such as fluffy white dressing gowns and a plasma TV in the bathroom the stay was great and I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
41,616,"Sep 20 2007 	Ideal for underground	We stayed in The Chamberlain for two nights in April 2007 and recommend the hotel for its location for Aldgate underground.We booked our room over the internet and, although the confirmation was for bed and breakfast, I knew from reviews of this hotel that breakfast wouldn't be included. There is a Wetherspoons near Tower Bridge and the breakfasts there are excellent value for money (two brekkies for a tenner).The room was booked for a 1pm check out which was definitely worth paying the little extra for. As our room was on the second floor we didn't hear any noise from the Underground, but I understand that rooms on the ground floor suffer from the vibrations from the trains.There was an excellent welcome tray, the rooms are extremely clean and the hotel upgraded us to a roof terrace room and so the balcony was a lovely extension to our room.The Chamberlain is close to Aldgate Underground which serves The Circle Line and Metropolitan Line, within walking distance to Brick Lane - famous for fabulous curries -and the Bank of England and St Paul's.I wouldn't hesitate to stay at The Chamberlain again, especially for the television in the bathroom - just make sure your partner doesn't keep flicking channels when you're trying to watch Deal or No Deal!!!!!"
42,616,"Sep 17 2007 	really friendly	I have just returned from a weekend in London, we took advantage of the Open House weekend held every year in the capital ,it is a fantastic chance to get to visit buildings not usually open to the public I would really recommend it.we stayed at the Chamberlain Hotel situated a few minutes walk from The Tower of London, the hotel was a fullers hotel which meant a fantastic pint of good london beer was on offer!The hotel has about 64 rooms and is exceptionally clean and the staff were really helpful and friendly, the only problem I encountered was the TV in the bathroom did not work and i was quite dissapointed, I had looked forward to luxuriating in bubbles whilst watching 'who wants to be a millionaire' !! but this was not meant to be!!The only other downside but I think this applies to most london hotels was the price of the breakfast, 15 for a full english we declined this as the Weatherspoons chain of pubs offer a huge breakfast for 4.50 a fraction of the price, apart from that I would definately recommend this hotel."
43,616,"Aug 18 2007 	Great if you can get a special rate	We live just outside London so we often stay in London hotels for a night after seeing concerts or whenever we know it's going to be too late to get the last train home.We booked the Chamberlain through Lastminute.com and paid 69. For this price, the hotel was an excellent choice. The regular rate, however, is about 220.The room was a good size, and very clean. The bathroom was lovely. Overall the room felt like it had just been redocorated.The aircon worked well (something we're quite fussy about!). We were at the back of the building and our room was nice and quiet. The beds were comfy too.Re previous reviews about towels etc - check the wardrobe for spares! And all hotels these days suggest not washing towels every day (the environment and all that) so the Chamberlain can't be faulted on this front.The pub downstairs was nice for a quiet drink (quite a rarity on a Friday night in the City!). The food both in the bar and through room service was basic but nicely done. Locationwise, it's two minutes from the DLR and the tube, and from tourist sites such as the Tower of London and Tower Bridge.We were really pleased with our stay but this review might have been different if we had paid 200! Would be good if you have business in the City (ie, if the company were paying). If you're looking for high-end hotels though, this might not cut the mustard. For 200 you could stay somewhere much nicer in London, the Zetter in Clerkenwell for example, or you could save money and stay somewhere like the London Bridge Hotel, which is just as nice, and only 150ish."
44,616,Aug 2 2007 	Not so good	We tried to book the excellent London Bridge Hotel as usual but unfortunately on this occasion they were full and were recommended the Chamberlain. The rooms were ok but we found that the much publicised plasma tv in the bathroom didn't work and there were not enough towels. When we arrived back in our room after our second day around the city we found that we had no new towels at all !! The cooked breakfast was cold and although there was cold meat and cheese there was no bread or rolls to have with it. On check out we were charged for cooked breakfasts that we didn't have and when we explained this to the receptionist she didn't believe us and went through to the kitchen to find out and still came back and told us that we did have cooked breakfast every morning !!! She eventually found someone who told her that we didn't but by this time we had decided that if our favourite London Bridge Hotel isn't available next time we certainly won't be staying at the Chamberlain !!!
45,616,"Jul 10 2007 	Great Hotel	I stopped at the Chamberlain for a week end break in July and I found the Hotel to be excelent value for money. The staff were always friendly and happy to help with any enquires. The room was comfortable and clean, I liked the tile tv in the bathroom which is something I have not encountered before. The location in the city is quiet at weekends and close to two tube stations and I ate at a Thai restaurant on the same street as the hotel and would do so again. Overall the hotel contributed to an hugely enjoyable weekend and i would definatly stop there again."
46,616,"Jul 9 2007	wow fantastic	i would reccomend this hotel to anyone, we stayed on the tour de france weekend the service was great and the rooms were immaculate. the continental breakfast is a must , very good location as its ten minute walk to tower bridge and the tower of london. lots of attractions for people to visit. we will stay again next year ."
47,616,"Jun 24 2007 	Great hotel great experience!!	Stayed in the Chamberlain with my girlfriend 22nd - 24th June (Fri &amp; Sat nights) and had a brilliant time, everything was spot on from the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out! The room was very cosy and comfortable, not to mention spotless, and had everything you could expect of a hotel including the most comfortable bed you could dream of, all mod cons (tv, phone, internet access, hairdryer, trouser press etc...) and a small tv screen built into the wall above the bath!!Food was also good as we ordered room service on the Saturday night - service was very prompt and the food itself was very tasty with a menu consisting mostly of traditional English grub. One thing I should point out though, is that the items in the mini bar seem to be on pressure switches as we had a wee look round it before replacing the items, only to be charged for them on departure!The Location is good for tourists as it is only a 5 min walk to the Tower of London and Tower Bridge and has 2 tube stations located within roughly 2 mins walk (Aldgate to the North and Tower Hill to the South) which will take you pretty much anywhere in the city for a small fare.Staff were also very helpful and friendly throughout our stay.Overall, we had a great time and would recommend this hotel to anyone - we will definitely use this hotel again any time we are in London."
48,616,"Jun 4 2007 	Weekend in the smoke.	We stayed in the Chamberlain for a Friday and Saturday night so that we could go out and enjoy some of London without having to worry about heading back to Kent at the end of each day!The room we stayed in overlooked the back of the hotel but it was clean and well presented and the view was fine (Not that we stayed in the room to look at the view!). The windows didn't open fully but luckily the room had air conditioning which kept it cool during the night. The bathroom has a mini LCD screen fitted into the wall, which would be great to lay and watch while in the bath, shame I had a shower. It's a little difficult to see through the glass, but turned onto the radio with the volume up a little you can hear it easily.Most of Friday was spent in the bar after eating in a nearby restaurant. The bar is also a pub open to the public and has the full range of Fullers beers on offer as well as some bottled Belgian and European beers :) The beer was good and the staff seemed to know what they were talking about when I asked about a couple of beers I didn't know and they were happy to let me try a sample. One surprise was the table service, as I neared the end of my pint a waitress came and asked if I would like another drink! Excellent, I didn't even need to leave the comfort of the big soft sofa.Will go back again for a weekend in the town."
49,616,"May 30 2007 	Had a really great weekend	I've stayed at this hotel twice previously on business and decided to book a surprise romantic getaway for my partner. We had a wonderful time. The rooms are on the small side but were well laid out and more than adequate for our needs. It feels like a boutique hotel, beautiful decor, luxurious toiletries in the bathroom, yummy biscuits on the tea tray, fresh flowers in the lobby and the TV above the bath is a nice touch. The staff were a pleasure, so helpful and very friendly. We asked about last minute theatre tickets and the manager at breakfast went off and found all the information we needed and then gave us directions to where we needed to go. We felt so relaxed after a leisurely breakfast it was almost a shame to leave and be touristy! We walked the five minutes to the bus stop and bought a two day pass which got us round all the sights, hop on and off as you like. We returned to the peace and calm of the hotel, a lovely bottle of wine and a very restful nights sleep. The following evening we had dinner in the bar which was really nice. I will definately use this hotel again in the future, for business and pleasure."
50,616,"May 22 2007 	Really good hotel !	We've spent three nights at Chamberlain ( 18-21 May) and really satisfied with the hotel. Helpful staff, quite good location ( close to Tower London), not large, but very clean and comfortable room, nice breakfast. I've booked our room via hotelsrus website. Got a very good deal ( 81 ? for a double with breakfast ) !Before booking I checked the reviews about this hotel on this forum. Must tell you, that the reviews are not so good as my experience with the hotel. I think it's a really nice hotel ! And not to speak about the price ! They have special weekend offer. Located in the City of London, which is a very quiet place at weekends. Close to the hotel ( 5 min. walk) you can reach two tube stations ( Aldgate, Tower HiIl ). So, I highly recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to London, either on business, or just for fun !"
51,616,"Mar 28 2007 	Very good hotel for City business	This is an excellent boutique hotel for business travellers, especially those with business in the City. The rooms are small but very clean and well-appointed with comfortable beds, good linen, reliable broadband internet and very nice bathrooms that include a small TV embedded in the wall so you can lie in the bath and watch your favourite show.I've stayed at the Chamberlain three times and have had a consistently good experience. The staff are friendly and efficient, and the food is reasonably good for hotel food. There is a small pub attached which is convenient for casual meals, as there are few restaurants open in the neighbourhood on the weekend."
52,616,"Jan 18 2007 	Half-decent hotel	I stayed in London for tourism for four days after a business meeting I attended in a nearby town had ended. My check-in experience was less than perfect as the desk attendant was slightly rude and not forthcoming for the information about which I inquired. On the first morning of my stay I made the mistake of trying the abysmal breakfast buffet, obviously bad so that guests are encouraged to order a la carte. The hot pot that came with the room didn't work. Twice I complained to housekeeping it was not replaced. The housekeeper did not wash a dirty glass that I had used, which I found completely unacceptable. The room/bathroom was kept pretty clean. The hotel has a bizarre perk of placing a tiny plasma TV in the bathroom facing the tub but (1) I'd never take a bath there; (2) I didn't care for watching TV in the bathroom! On the positive side, the hotel's room service and hotel bar/restaurant (Fuller's) are very good. I ordered room service once and ate at the adjoining bar once. Both times the food was good quality English fare (fish and chips, pot pie, etc.). And I'm not a huge fan of English food.When I booked a cab before my departure it arrived promptly. Wake up calls were also perfect."
53,616,"Dec 10 2006 	Good value for 99 BB !!	We stayed one night in superior room # 409.Had our room at 3pm as promised despite the fact that they were fully booked the night before.The good thing about being on the 4th floor is that you don't feel the vibrations of the metro as some of the travellers mentioned it in their reviews. View on the inside court with emergency staircase in front, so nothing exciting, but that was not important to us. The street view would not have been much better as it is located in a business area. Not far at all from the metro Tower Hill, so that was good. The lobby is very nice and charming. Typically English!Lift: modern. Impressive. Decor: liked very much all the engraved pictures in very nice frames. The room was large enough with a table and 2 nice chairs, desk, a minibar and a TV on top of it, a nice and large bed with a cosy duvet. Air conditionning worked well. We had two robes, and 2 chocolates. Iron and ironing table in the closet, as well as a press for pants. Did not tried the TV neither the small plasma one in the bathroom. Bathroom was nice, large enough, with a bathtub and a shower. There was also a phone. However, a hair dryer would have been much more appropriated than a tv!! Front desk staff was fine. However, we would have appreciated recommendation that the restaurant was too small for the whole guests and that we could have to wait... when we arrived at 9:40am on Saturday, there was a waiting list of 20min long! As we needed to leave precisely in 20min to get to the airport, we asked for room service and that was approved with no surcharge. Took them 10 min to bring it to us. They had no more croissants, but had other pastries. However, orange juice was preserved (and not from fresh squizzed oranges) and hot chocolate had no taste... Had only marmelade and honey.Location: Not far from London Bridge, in a business area as mentioned, so not very lively, particularly at night, but that was not a problem since the metro was not far (green and yellow lines). Not much more choice of restaurants, you need to go closer to downtown for that. The hotel had a restaurant that we did not tried. Overall impression was good. We would definitely come back there!Sorry, forgot to take pictures!"
54,616,"Nov 17 2006 	Ripped off with Breakfast!	Hotel convenient for City and good selection of beers in the bar (so they should be, the hotel is owned by Fullers Brewery!!), but experienced ruined by inattentive staff (everything was too much trouble), defects in the fire alarm installation (with the result that guests were evacuated around midnight and left to stand in the street with no explanation or apology) and double charged for breakfast on check out (Expedia rate expressly included full English breakfast, but this was denied by hotel)"
55,616,"Oct 21 2006 	Service at the Chamberlain Hotel poor.	I arrived at the hotel at 2 p.m. on Sunday Oct. 8 and was told I couldn't check in until 3 p.m. So I went into the pub and had a light meal to kill time. At 2:40 p.m. I returned to the receptionist and told her I had been traveling all night from the U.S. and asked if she could please give me a room. Although it was now only 20 minutes before check-in time, she still said there was nothing available because it was a Sunday. I sat on a couch in the lobby and proptly fell asleep for 45 minutes until a room was available. Of the 60+ rooms at this hotel, I find it inconceivable there wasn't one ready 20 minutes before check-in time.The next morning, I asked to speak with the hotel general manager about my experience the previous day. When the receptionist called the manager on the phone and told her someone wanted to speak with her about a complaint, the manager said she was too busy.I personally will never stay at this hotel again."
56,616,"Oct 11 2006 	very good	We stayed at this hotel due to recommendations from friends. We had booked direct at a very good price. The room was not ready until 3pm, but luckily our friends could look after our bags for us. The rooms were clean and tidy and the aircon worked fine considering the corridors were red hot. We were going to use the internet at the hotel, but this seemed very expensive. We ate in the bar ajoining the hotel which was very pleasant. One downside to the weekend (Saturday) was a bar/club almost opposite that was emptying out at 3.30am so there were alot of car horns etc.Although this was not the fault of the hotel just due to the location, the rest of the vacinity was very quiet at the weekend due to it being a business district.There are good underground links just a short walk away, but this also means that you can feel the vibration when a train goes past.Overall this is a good clean hotel, in a good weekend location at an amazing price. It is close to transport links and some decent attractions."
57,616,"Sep 29 2006 	Great Location nice hotel	We were able to find a great deal on expedia and only paid $115 per night. The hotel is a great location and only a few minute walk from the Tower Hill and the Tower Hill Station. The rooms were nice and clean. Most of the staff was great, especially Nathan who helped us plan our entire day... and had some great suggestions on how to see London without spending a fortune. The AC went out in our room (it was a pretty warm night) so they offered to put us in another room. Overall, it was a nice place, great location and a friendly staff. I would definately stay there again, especially for what we paid."
58,616,"Aug 28 2006 	Glad we got a cheap deal...	I had a hard time finding somewhere in London for 80 a night with air con and a lift as we had a baby with us in the height of summer.Managed to get a deal through a website for this hotel at 80 a night (breakfast not included), that advertises in the lobby at 255 a night.The website stated that it could not guarantee our room type (a double) so when we arrived I wasn't too fussed that we were in a twin room as they had upgraded us to a larger one.Later I was a bit miffed as to why they couldn't give us a double room as we only ever saw one other person there the whole time. Where were all the guests taking up the double rooms???Anyway, when we got in the room it was lovely. Spacious, newly furnished and a great bathroom with mini plasma screen in front of the bath (separate shower).It was hot in the room but we figured they didnt turn the air on until the room was occupied. We set it for cool and went out for lunch.The hotel is in a superb location for the weekend as it is a business district and so deathly quiet on the streets, but only 5 mins walk to Tower of London. Aldgate tube station is 1 min walk away.When we got back to the hotel, the room was stifling hot (it was 35 degrees outside). I went down to reception toask if we could change rooms as the air con wasn't working and you couldn't open the window.I was told that unfortunately, their air con system was located on the roof as so in the summer it didn't work because it was hot.???????????????????????????????????????????????I'm from Australia and it gets a heck of a lot hotter there and I've never heard that excuse.I was told someone was fixing it and it should be ok soon and someone would come and open our window for us in the meantime.Ongoing saga - different staff having no clue about the air con not working and didn't know anything about workman working on it. In the end they said I could change rooms if I wanted, but when I went in to the other room it was the same situation.I think it's a case of their air conditioning is not very good (basically just blowed room temp air) and they are not sure how to handle complaints about it.The evenings were not too bad as the window let in a bit of a breeze, but it defeated the purpose of me looking for one specifically with air con so i didnt have a whingy baby at night.Anyway, the positives.Great locationGood bar but a bit quiet. Staff are a bit vague but that's London for youGood food in the bar/restaurant including hot rock cooking. They give you a raw steak on a sizzling hot granite plate and you cut and cook it yourself. Good value for the price (12 from memory for a big steak, chips and veg).One BIG complaint with the restaurant though, was room service. I ordered a treacle tart with clotted cream to be brought up to our room as baby was sleeping. We had the lights off so when it came, I ate it by the glow of the tv.I spat out the first mouthful. There was something terribly wrong with it. I turned the light on and tried to figure it out.Turns out some genius in the kitchen had decided to use lemon sorbet instead of clotted cream. With a treacle tart???????I'm no food snob, but it is the most vile combination.I phoned the room service and after explaining the situation very nicely (i'm so bad at demanding what i want, i make it sound like its my fault in the end...), the gentleman (waiter in the bar/restaurant) said-&quot;well, what do you want me to do about it?&quot;grrrr. Just be thankful he is behind a bar and not doing brain surgery with initiative like that......I calmly said that I would like what was on the menu and what I ordered - treacle tart with clotted cream.Anyway, new one came and surprise surprise, no clotted cream, but at least they gave me ice cream.How hard is it to say you've got no clotted cream????????????? They had 2 opportunities to tell me not including when they brought it up to me in the room!!!I was half expecting it to be mashed potato......afterall it's white like cream, so thats good enough right?Bottom line is, if you want a nice hotel room, in a great location, it's winter time and you get a good price on the internet, then The Chamberlain is a good choice as long as you don't mind so-so service.But anything above so-so in London is hard to find anyway!"
59,616,"Aug 14 2006 	Not a bad choice for Central London	Booked on a London hotel search engine and got a double room for 70 a night. Had considered the usual budget hotel chains, but decided on something a bit more upmarket, and what a good choice. Nice clean lobby, free internet access, and very friendly staff all either English, or speaking excellent English. Room quite small but very nicely furnished and spotless with cable tv, tea and coffee making facilities and air-con, a must for London in midsummer! Bathroom nice, powerful shower and a tv built into the tiles on the wall to be viewed whilst lazing in the bath.... Pity they didn't see fit to change the plastic toilet seat which had seen better days and bore an assortment of scratch marks from previous occupants. But that wasn't a major issue. Minories is a very quiet street, literally two mins walk from Tower Hill Station, bit out of the way of the West End clubs etc, but cheap in a cab, or better and cheaper on the N15 nightbus which runs every 15 mins. Breakfast (decent continental spread) included on weekends, but pricey at 12.95 on weekdays. Don't bother and amble into a nearby cafe for something cheaper. All in all, a very pleasant stay for the money and will go back for more... Dont pay more than 90-100 per double room per night. The advertised &quot;rack rate&quot; of 235 a night is a total joke. No way is it worth that kinda money."
60,616,"Aug 13 2006 	Great hotel in slick city district	Our experience was a very good one. This hotel was one of the best my husband and I have stayed in. The price we got via the net was very reasonable, compared to the GBP 225 they wanted had we walked in of the street (for a standard double room). The room was compact but not too small and I loved the plasma screen in the bathroom. Watching telly while having a (rain) shower was lovely and a novelty to me. Everything was very clean and the beds very comfortable. The experience was a special treat for us and it felt like it, too! Minibars are always over-priced, but if you are such a plonker you need booze or a snack late at night, then you almost deserve to be ripped off. We had a can of lager @ GBP 2.70 each but hey, we did ask for it! The breakfast we did not touch as it was too expensive, albeit tasty sounding. For people on a low budget like us, who are not too fussy I would recommend the The Pummeler's Rest, a Whetherspoon pub across Tower Bridge on the corner. Ok, so you may have to clear the table yourself but for GBP 1.99 for cooked breakfast, it fills a hole and serves its purpose. Staff were very friendly and helpful. I'd emailed them to check which tube station would be closest to the hotel and got a prompt reply. During our stay, we were treated courteously and professionally at all times. I would definitely go back and stay there. However, pubs close at the weekends so if you are on a pub crawl, you need to leave the City and take the tube to a different part of London. The pub downstairs was pleasant and served some nice snacks and proper meals and the beer was lovely and well kept.  So, if you want to have a bit of London away from the hustle and bustle and some city slickness, then I can recommend the Chamberlain. Very close to tube, Tower of London and London Bridge, you are in beautiful surroundings where you can also chill out."
61,616,Jun 29 2006 	bookings not reliable !	We have been guests for business visits to this hotel at least a dozen times. Bookings are always made by our company. We learned recently that the hotel overbooks. Even after confirming our reservation (they even give you a reservation number) our room was given away to others and our booking cancelled without notice or explanation.We found out from others that it is new policy to overbook and rooms are given away to those who appear first. You will never be sure to get the room you thought to have booked.Hotel staff &quot;ssisted&quot; us to find a new hotel but sent us to the wrong hotel on purpose.
62,616,"Jun 7 2006	We Loved It!!	Maybe us Irish are not used to quality hotels(ha ha he he ha)but we were well impressed with this gaff.I took my beautiful girlfriend here on a birthday weekend and we had a great time.The checkin staff were extremely pleasent and offered a morning newspaper if required.Our room was quite large and very clean,with an excellent double bed which we made good use of later!! Sleeping i mean you filthy minded person!!!!The bathroom was perfect-Spotlessly clean,big open glass shower,heated towel rails,beautifuly tiled sink unit,oh,i almost forgot,a plasma tv screen in front off the bath!!!!.It rocks man!We had a good nites sleep without any noise or hassel.I recommend this hotel to any romantic couples seeking a nice time together.Don't listen to the moaners,it's what you make it!!!!"
63,616,"Jun 7 2006	Brilliant!!	Myself and my husband have just returned from a trip to London. We stayed at the Chamberlain hotel for 2 nights. We loved the hotel. Excellent value for money, great breakfast included. Rooms lovely, very cosy. The lovely duvets made it hard to get out of bed. Tea making facilities, Iron, a safe, excellent shower. We will stay there again. Staff friendly and helpful. The hotel was very quiet at night time, no noise or disturbances at all."
64,616,"May 25 2006	Warm 	As we arrived wet and cold from our walk from the Liverpool tube station the sight of the Chamberlain's inviting lobby and smiling desk clerk were a welcome sight. The Chamberlain Hotel is located about 5 to 10 minutes walk from the Liverpool station but with the drizzle coming down and the light failing I got us a little lost on our way there. We had booked a twin room with tickets to the Tower of London and continental breakfast for L107.00 for the two of us. Check in was quickly done and as we wanted supper at the restaurant we dropped our bags off and headed to the dining room as they were to close in 15 minutes. Although we were the only diners the service and meal were great; potted prawns, chicken with vegtables and trecal tart. Our huge room was lovely two very comfy beds with down pillows and duvets. Regular pillows are stored in the closet. A big bathroom with rainfall showerhead, heated towel bar and a TV for while you bath. A TV, plug in for laptop, mini bar and coffee station were all available also. The room had wall to wall windows and black out curtains. After a great nights sleep, quiet and so comfortable with the duvets we went down to breakfast. The continental breakfast buffet was fresh and had enough variety to satisfy us. Ceral, muffins, croisants, toast, fruit, yogurt, juices, meat and cheese. They also offered a full english breakfast for an additional L4.00 each. We only had a few hours in London before our return trip home so choose the Chaimberlain due to its close proximity to the Tower of London and St. Pauls catherdral. It was very quiet on Saturday most shops were closed but for us it was an ideal location. I would stay at the Chamberlain again when in London."
65,616,"Mar 19 2006 	Good business hotel	Stayed in a superior room with lovely bathroom with walk in shower &amp; TV. Bed was comfortable and room size OK. Room service menu had a decent, although unadventurous selection. Service was good. I would definitely stay here again when on business in the city if I could get a reasonable rate. Weekend rates are good value, but I prefer the Apex or Grange in this area at the weekend as they have leisure facilities."
66,616,"Feb 7 2006	A good enough choice -for london	After basing my decision primarily on guest reviews I booked this hotel. It was well located (easy access via Aldgate station), in a business focused area, which made it very quiet over the weekend. The rooms were nice and well decorated. Generally small, but I guess that's 'typical' for London. However, it fell short on a few details, a couple of broken bathroom fixtures and the cupboard door wouldn't close. Not the end of the world but I expect better from a 4 star. I would recommend it however, as I may have just had bad luck with my room."
67,616,"Jan 9 2006	Excellent - Great Value	Like most reviews this is a very good value hotel. It meets the basics in terms of location (5 min walk from Tower Hill), comfort (great bed and well appointed clean rooms)and somewhere to eat and drink with the pub attached. The service was good and at only 70 per room, this was 3 to 4 star luxury - plasma screen in bathroom, mini bar, good sized rooms for a fraction of the price. Well worth staying here."

81,616,Nov 20 2007 	Hotel Chamberlain: Opinin
1,617,"Nov 24 2009 	Perfect location	We stayed 2 nights for a long week-end. It's the perfect location, a lot of touristical sites are at walking distance. The rest is 5 to 10 min bus or taxi away. The staff is really nice and helpful. We changed room as we were in a twin bedroom the first night. The first room was a bit small and the toilet flush was temperamental.. But the second was great . Both were comfortable but a bit noisy though (you're in a very busy part of London). I cannot comment on the amenities as we did not use them."
2,617,Nov 16 2009 	Excelent location -great staff	I spend 4nights at the hotel with my son and sister and enjoyed it very much. The location is really excellent. I was really impressed from the staff. Very helpfull and friendly.Rooms was Ok but towels was not ok. They need to be changed with new ones. Brekfast was great except the last day that some thinks (marmelades bread...) that we was used to eat the previous days was not offered any more.I certainly liked it and would recommend it.
3,617,"Nov 15 2009 	Great hotel for central London but watch out for the Buckingham Wing!	I stayed 9 nights in this hotel on business Oct - Nov 09 but I have also stayed here as a leisure traveller in Feb 09 and in 2008. I think this is a great choice for a central London stay. The location is excellent, with so many sites and eating / drinking areas within easy reach by foot and also with immediate and easy access to public transport. The hotel is modern and the rooms in the main part of the hotel all recently renovated to a high standard. These rooms are very comfortable with excellent facilities including iron and ironing board tucked in to the wardrobe (handy on a business trip!) and the public areas are plush. The staff are friendly, professional and helpful. I would always choose this hotel first when coming back to London to stay, however there are two notes I would make that might be of use to other travellers. Firstly, room service is very expensive and I don't believe it is worth the money; arriving late on my first night I ordered a burger which was one of the cheapest things on the menu at 15 but that also incurred an additional 5 tray charge, and it was absolutely not worth the price tag. Secondly, and more important of the two notes, I discovered on check in on my fourth stay that there is a Buckingham Wing in addition to the main building. They appear to assign rooms in the main building first with overflow in to the Buckingham Wing when busy. This section is reached via the main building so is not an entirely separate annexe but it is technically a separate building on the other side of Villiers Street, connected to the main hotel by an elevated walkway. This Wing has not been renovated and the room I was assigned to was shabby in the extreme. The furniture was chipped and scuffed, there was a scorch mark on the wallpaper, the furnishings were ugly and dated, the carpet was grubby round the edges and there was visible, crumbling plaster work around fixtures to the walls and on top of that, it was noisy. The room was charged out at the same rate as a modernised (and very nice) room in the main building. I asked to be moved the instant I got in to the room but was told that they were fully booked that evening but they could move me the next day. I took them up on that and the staff were helpful and accommodating, moving my luggage for me etc. The room that I moved to in the main building was of the same high standard as the other rooms that I have stayed in in that section and I was very happy with it. The Buckingham Wing room was clean and that was its only positive note as it was otherwise utterly sub-standard for a hotel of this class and price-tag. If they try to assign you one of these rooms (I believe it's all those numbered 800+, but they will probably explain it's in the Buckingham Wing when they try to check you in to it as you also have to take two lifts), unless tired and old-fashioned is your preference, I would recommend that you ask to be moved; they charge the same rate for one of these inferior rooms as they do for one of the up-to-date, attractive rooms in the main building!Staying in one of the rooms in the main hotel however, is a pleasure and taking in to account my two notes above, I would still stay in this hotel again on my next visit to London without any hesitation."
4,617,"Nov 9 2009 	Boutique Experience - Stands Out from the Crowd	I stay often in hotels for work as well as pleasure but this hotel stands out from the crowd. I can only put it down to the amazing attention to detail that is reflected in everything from the ambience of the lobby and common areas through to the excellent service.I had the pleasure of meeting the main hotel manger Mr Riddian Davies who was not only able to sort out some minor issue personally for me but was clearly the driving force behind the hotel's look and feel.As for the location, I found it great. Well connected for work (the Tube entrance is literally next to the hotel) but also for walking to tourist spots.The lobby has a beautiful atmosphere with great design and a host of candles that make you feel like you've been transported in seconds away from the hustle and bustle of Trafalgar Square and The Strand which are just on your doorstep. Despite the large number of bedrooms, the staff made me feel special, as if I'd just checked into a small, more personal hotel.Thoroughly recommended."
5,617,"Nov 5 2009 	Very good hotel great location!	This hotel was recommended by some friends as being a perfect hotel for those visiting London; They were 100% right. This hotel is located right on top of the Charing Cross tube station making it perfect to hop on the tube and travel around the city. In addition, the hotel is a few short blocks from the Thames River and the Waterloo bridge. The location is right by several sites include Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, London Eye, several Theaters, Covent Garden Shopping, etc. Have I said enough about the location? As for the hotel, I won't go into too much detail that isn't already here. We stayed in the standard rooms, two double beds. Rooms were clean, and taken care of daily. We had no complaints about the rooms at all. There is a restaurant/bar that we did not check out, but it seemed very nice. There were several rooms booked for events so I assume this would also be a great place for a business event of some kind. Views from the hotel really depend on your room but we weren't concerned. Flat screen TV with several channels available. The only negative I would post is with the wireless service. It was available for a fee and even the business center computer required payment for the service. This day and age, they need to have that be free. Otherwise, my wife and I truly enjoyed our experience. During our next trip we will definitely stay here again!"
6,617,"Nov 4 2009 	Great location terrible beds	I traveled to London for a business conference and stayed for 6 nights at the Charing Cross. Overall impressions: The public areas of the hotel are very nice, with alot of thoughtful and elegant details. The location is fantastic, a great jumping-off point to any sighseeing destination. Hotel staff was friendly, but not overly so. Restaurants were a bit on the slow side for service, although food was decent. As a meeting venue, the ballrooms were well-appointed and conveniently located on one level. Now for some details:I travel frequently, both domestically and internationally for work, and have experienced hotels at all levels of service and amenities---I would have to rate the rooms at Charing Cross as average ---- fairly clean (although the carpets could have used a good vacuuming) and moderately spacious (for a large city hotel) with up to date decor. However, I have never, in all my years of travel, experienced beds as hard as this. No exaggeration, the mattress felt like a slab of concrete with a thin layer of foam on top. There was a very nice duvet and lovely pillows, but the mattress had no give whatsoever.I called down to the front desk to inquire about the firm mattresses, and they informed me that the matresses had all been newly replaced and they could move me to another room, but with no guarantee of a less firm bed. Since I had already unpacked and gotten situated, I opted to stay put. The first night , mainly due to jet lag , I fell asleep right away even with the firm bed. However, by the second night, I could not get comfortable and ended up with only 2 hours sleep. I had a meeting that day and had to drag myself though it, thinking I could get some rest that evening. Another sleepless night later (this time only got 1 hour) and I was near total exhaustion. I asked if the hotel could provide a feather bed topper or something I could use to pad the mattress. They brough up an extra duvet which I layered on top of the mattress. It didn't help much, in fact by the time I left after 6 nights, I had a good-sized bruise on my hip where it had rested on the mattress every night. The other rather strange thing was the absence of washcloths in the bathroom. After I got settled upon arrival, I prepared to take a shower and a nap. I went into the bathroom and was pleased to find a heated towel rack (which, unfortunately, never quite got warm enough to do any good), and a small selection of bath amenities. There were also several nice fluffy towels, but no washcloths. I looked all throughout the room for washcloths and finally called guest services. They informed me that the hotel does not have wachcloths. I was a bit confused....how did they expect guests to clean themselves? Was I expected to use a large towel, or just rub a bar of soap over myself (mind you, I had a guest staying with me, so kind of gross to share soap)? Eventually, I got in touch with housekeeping who arrived at my room with a small bag of mismatched washcloths and told me they can only give me two (one for me, one for guest). We had to ask several times during our stay to replenish the cloths, but I thought it was just so odd not to have these in a 'better' hotel. I did notice a note in the guest services book indicating that you can ask for a bathrobe as well, but with a stern warning about entertaining thoughts of 'lifting' it. So perhaps they had a rash of washcloth thefts in the past...very strange nonetheless.Overall, my stay was mixed. Aside from the washcloth issue, the minor room cleanliness issue, and the sometimes slow service, I probably would have rated this hotel pretty highly had it not been for the beds. Its a shame that this one thing clouded my judgement about an entire hotel, but I will forever remember lying on their concrete bed, tossing and turning, and the exhaustion that followed. Not the way I wanted to remember what was otherwise a lovely trip to a wonderful city."
7,617,"Nov 4 2009 	Awesome location great service good rooms	The hotel is in a great location, being within easy walking distance to the theatres and other cultural areas, such as Covent Garden. The hotel is literally on top of Charing Cross underground station, so it's perfect if travelling underground. The service was great, from the concierge checking us into our flight and printing the boarding passes, to the barman and his great cocktails. The breakfast was fantastic, with a great selection of hot and cold food - although the seats are quite strange in the dining room!The room was very clean, with a large flat screen TV and wireless internet (not complimentary). The room wasn't huge, with the single beds right next to each other, and without a view. A couple of the tiles in the bathroom were loose underfoot, and the shower head wasn't great, but no real complaints. Overall a great place to stay and undoubtedly one of the best locations in London."
8,617,"Nov 3 2009 	Excellent location and great accessible room	My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at the Charing Cross Hotel. The central location is incredibly convenient - we loved that there is a cab stand right next door outside of the tube station in case we didn't want to walk. And the management was very friendly and helpful, though we found the service in the lounge and bar quite slow.The key for us was the room. My husband uses a wheelchair, and it was fabulous for our needs - quiet and pleasant with a decent amount of space for a city hotel. They have two accessible rooms, and we stayed in 210, which is apparently the larger of the two. The huge bathroom has a large roll-in shower with a hand-held shower head. My husband is not a small man, and the wall-mounted shower seat was substantial enough for him to use. There was enough room next to the bed for my husband to get in and out, and the hardwood floors and wheels on the bed frame allowed for us to move the bed easily to allow for more room, if needed. There were only two drawbacks to the room setup, as far as we were concerned. First, the bed had a new mattress, which was quite high. (Apparently, the management didn't realize it was going to be as high as it was.) My husband was able to transfer OK, but it might be difficult for some. Second, there are no outlets next to the bed, so we were not able to use the CPAP machine we'd brought.We took the manager's card, when we left, because it will definitely be at the top of our list, if we make a return trip to London."
9,617,"Oct 26 2009 	Great location great price	We stayed in the other building over the walkway and I have to say I thought it was fine. Staff were great and the breakfast is one of the best i've had for this standard of hotel in London. The location can't be beaten, 2 mins from Trafalgar Square and right on the Strand and on top of Charing Cross Station. That said, it was really quiet for such a central location. Loads of places to eat with Covent Garden just over the road."
10,617,"Oct 25 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - Brilliant Location	Stayed here for 2 nights as part of weekend break. From the outside the hotel may look nothing special however, appearances deceive! Once you step indside you are transported into a beautifully designed, spacious and elegant hotel. My large and airy room was on the 5th floor overlooking the Strand. Noise from the constant flow of traffic was minimal, but the view wasexcellent. Breakfast was superb, although the breakfast room itself was a little on the small side for such an imposing hotel. Staff were excellent, polite and always willing to give you advice. As you are right by the Charing cross tube station, getting around London was simple. Of cousre the biggest bonus is that if you are looking for a great hotel to stay at for a theatre break...then look no further than this! I will return!!"
11,617,"Oct 13 2009	THE Hotel - A Must	Traveled with 11 yr old daughter. We couldn't have been more fortunate based on location; quality; service; tube; sites, etc. It is THE hotel for central location. Any direction gives you walking distance to main London sites and great eats. Post office, banks, drug stores, etc. are all at your fingertips. Room size is perfect; nice hot showers; great breakfast; friendly staff; quick tube access and easy in/out. Highly recommended."
12,617,"Oct 8 2009 	Good but Not as Nice as Last Time	Love the location. Easy to get to from tube or dot2dot service. Friendly and helpful staff. At first we were put in the adjoining wing. We switched immediately. The rooms were dingy, out of date and in need of a good make-over. The rooms right off the lobby stairs are quite nice. Modern, comfortable. Love the in room tea service. Decent breakfast (a hot section, breads, yogurts, cereals, pastries) although it was moved to a different room with a lot less charm. Hotel seemed crowded. The tables were very close together. Waited a good while before being offered tea or coffee. Again, it was very crowded. There was a line to get into the breakfast room.Lobby bathroom now requires you to obtain a key from the front desk. I guess that is a hazard of being located next to a tube stop. Overall, a great base for London. Gave it three stars because the vibe was not as nice as previous visit and food seemed a bit lower quality.Beware: If you are very sensitive to perfumes, the hotel seems to pump a very strong &quot;rose&quot; perfume or air spray into the common areas."
13,617,Sep 25 2009 	Perfect hotel Perfect location	Just come back from a business trip spending a couple of days at the Charing Cross hotel and took the opportunity to take my wife who had a few days off.We loved this hotel and it's main selling point his it;s staff.All we had the pleasure to meet were excellent hosts and couldn't do enough for you. We were upgraded to a junior suite and it was lovely.On top of this its about 30 seconds from both Charing Cross Station and underground and trafalgar square etc it really is a fantastic hotel.We will definately be returning and have said we'll take our two kids next time.
14,617,"Sep 21 2009 	Lovely hotel great location	What a great hotel! Booked the Charing Cross for a weekend break with Tesco clubcard vouchers we needed to use up before the end of the year. Can't comment as others have on the standard of the room allocated when you use clubcard vouchers as we opted for the upgrade to a junior suite that we were offered on arrival. The junior suite was lovely, loads of space, light and airy and spotlessly clean, and despite overlooking the very busy Strand, we didn't notice very much traffic noise at all. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Despite being very busy the hot food was constantly being replenished and the quality was very good. The range of cold foods was also very good, although we were disappointed that the advertised danish pastries failed to materialise. The location of the hotel is perfect for anyone wanting to see central London. All the places we wanted to see were either a few minutes walk away, or quickly reached on the tube, located directly under the hotel.We're planning to return to London in January, and would definitely stay here again."
15,617,Sep 15 2009 	Great Hotel	Stayed here on a business trip to host some visitors to an exhibition at the Excel Centre. Check in was efficient and the room was clean tidy and well decorated with fairly new equipment/fittings. Breakfast was buffett style which suited me. Tea/coffe making in room was a plus.One day I arrived back around 4 pm to find that my bed had been changed and made but the pillows had not had the pillow cases put on them. No big deal as I simply did them myself. Later as I relaxed in the bath my door opened - after a buzzer sounded which I did not know what it was - and in walked a lady !! On seeing me she apologised and left the room. Phew!!The hotel is first class; convenient to everything with the tube and main line railway next door. My room was 224 and I was not disturbed in any way by noise and slept soundly.I ate each night in the reastuarant because my 'firm' insisted - on the first floor and the food was of a very high standard although the menu does not change; but it was varied and the food was hot and delicious.Would I go back - absolutely.
16,617,Sep 11 2009 	Great value for central London	We normally stay in the Mayfair area when we visit London but wasrecommended this hotel by afriend. It did not disappoint. There was a minor problem with our room when we arrived and within minutes the manager arrived and upgraded us to a junior suite. The staff were helpful and arranged bookings for us at restaurants with no problem. The ratesare reasonable for central London and the location is great.
17,617,"Sep 9 2009 	Amazing hotel...amazing location!	Having read some of the reviews after we booked this hotel I was nervous about staying there. However now that I'm home I had to write a review and say what an amzing hotel it is. We got a special deal, three nights for two with breakfast included. When we arrived we upgraded to a junior suite. The staff on arrival were extremely helpful. We arrived early at 9am and we got our Room key straight away which was great. The lobby and entrance to the hotel is gorgeous and the one thing that stuck with me was the beautiful smell everytime we walked in. The whole downstairs area and staircase is just stunning,full of period features and character. Our room was huge!! For being in central London we could not believe it. We were on floor 8 room 530. We had a great view out front looking over the whole city. Room was really clean and had everything we needed. Bed was big and comfy and just so clean. Location of the hotel is the best. Right next dood to tube station, starbucks across the road a Boots next door and all tourist attractions onyour doorstep within walking distance. In the evenings the dim the lights in the lobby and have beautiful little candles and tea lights dotted everywhere,makes for a really nice touch.so warm, welcomig and homely when you come in from a night in the city. My boyfriend loved everything about this hotel and will be staying in it again. Stunning!"
18,617,"Sep 8 2009 	great location but....	I recently booked this hotel using our clubcard vouchers from a well known supermarket. I have to say the location is fantastic for alot of tourist things, which are within a short distance such as Covent Garden, Theatreland the Imperial War Musuem etc.BUT I have to agree with another reveiw earlier on and pose the question because we were a discounted price did we get put in the cheapest of rooms? I had looked at their website and was impressed by the photograph of the standard double room. Unfortunately this was not the room we were placed in or anything like it. We were placed in the second building over the walkway and found it to be tired and tatty in relation to it's decor and outlook onto a wall/roof. There was some very bad marks on the walls where I would imagine suitcases have been banged against it and the bathroom mirror needed a spruce up as well, although the bathroom itself was satisfactory otherwise. We eventually found the hairdrier, which was securley attached to the base of the top draw making it slightly difficult to use when blow drying ones hair!The bed was comfortable and we had plenty of cupboard space and extra pillows.Breakfast was held over the weekend in the Betjamin room, a marvellous room with amazing decor. There was a good selection of hot and cold foods available and the staff were all very attentive. Somewhat confusingly, breakfast was served in a different place on the Monday and this could have been signposted alittle better for customers who had by now got use to going to another room!The other areas of the hotel such as front desk, foyer and corridors were of a much better standard to the room and we liked the touch of putting candles throught the reception area at night giving it a lovely welcoming feel on returning from shows etc.The concierge proved very useful with a good local knowledge and helpful attitude.All in all we were satisfied with our stay as we paid very little to do so, put had I paid the rate of 175.00 a night they were asking and got that room I would not have been too impressed."
19,617,"Aug 31 2009 	ideal location	We arrived early in the morning before check in time and immediately got a key to our room. The staff was friendly and welcoming.The general areas of the hotel are nice, but the room we got was a bit outdated.The wallpaper needed to be replaced, the carpet was old, the hairdryer in the bathroom didn't work, etc.Our room was spacious enough for our short stay (3 days) and was located in a quiet area of the hotel which was very nice.The breakfast was ok, but not very varied and VERY British.The location of the hotel is ideal - you can visit most sights on foot.We booked this hotel on a website which offers special deals and got a good price for it. If I had to pay the full price I probably wouldn't have been so positive.Do I recommand this hote? Yes, if you get it for a fair price."
20,617,"Aug 23 2009 	Used to be a preferred hotel---but no longer	On our arrival we were alllocated a pokey little room with a double bed when my reservation had requested an executive room with a king bed. We had booked for a week as part of a longer tour of the UK and there was totally insufficient storage space---no chest of drawers, just one small drawer. We raised this with reception who somewhat reluctantly showed us a room in the Buckingham Wing. Although this room had a king bed and better storage, it was very dark and a most depressing outlook.The bathroom was poorly equipped for a room of this supposed standard- no soap so thank God for Boots next door. We wrote a personal letter to the Manager while still at the hotel But received no response. On our return to Australia weeks later, we found a brief e-mailed reply which contained no semblance of an apology or even a basic understanding of our complaints.In fairness, we found the concierge staff to be helpful and informative. Due to its perfect location, this used to be our hotel of choice in London. Sadly,no longer."
21,617,"Aug 19 2009 	Good Hotel in Great Location	I stayed with my wife in the Charing Cross for 8 days, while vacationing in London. All in all, it was a very good experience. The staff - especially the concierge desk - were very helpful and accomodating. We arrived early in the morning, several hours before check in time. They stored our bags and when we came back later in the day we discovered they had already checked us in and our bags were waiting for us in the room. Our room was neat, clean, and large by London standards. The hotel was quiet, and the bed was comfortable.Our room rate included breakfast, so we ate most mornings in the restaurant. The fare was pretty good for a breakfast buffet, but it never changed and got pretty old after a few days. In our 8-day stay, the only part of the breakfast buffet that ever changed was the shape of the fried potatoes. For other meals, the restaurant was too pricey for our taste - especially with hundreds of more modest priced places within walking distance.The hotel's biggest selling point is its location, right at the Charing Cross rail station, and a few feet from both the Charing Cross and Embankment underground stations. Its also within easy walking distance of most the major tourist attractions, and a quick tube ride from the rest.About the only negative we could find was the hotel's wifi, which is available, but way too expensive. We carried our laptop to a McDonald's about 3 doors down from the hotel, where the wifi is free, whenever we needed to use the net."
22,617,"Aug 17 2009 	Polished surface but....	Found an online deal for a one night stay with breakfast and the location coupled with the star rating made it seem like a good deal.The lobby and public areas are very nice. All of the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is very good if you're looking for somewhere that you can easily reach all of the attractions, theatres, shops etc. Its literally inside the gates of Charing Cross station, a 1 min walk to Trafalgar Sq, 2 mins to Leicester Sq, 5 mins to Covent Garden and about 10 mins to Oxford Circus or Parliament Square. Location wise its the best I've stayed in in London.Now for the not so good bits. The room really did not meet the standard of the public areas of the hotel. Whether they keep certain room for discounted rate guests I don't know but it was small even by central London standards, worn carpets, paintwork in need of attention. The bedside lamps were hanging off the wall and we experienced problems with a malfunctioning toilet which wasn't rectified, despite us reporting it to reception, until the following day.The rate included breakfast which otherwise is priced at 18 for the buffet. I have had much better breakfast buffets it hotels of lower standard and it definetly isn't worth it if its not included. They even price &quot;extras&quot; as items other hotels include on the buffet as standard e.g. vegetarian sausages.All in all I wouldn't pay anywhere near the full rate, we paid 100 which was just about ok."
23,617,"Aug 12 2009 	THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE BEDS EVER!!! Ruined would could be a good hotel	Having travelled for business and pleasure, business almost twice a month for the past ten years, I have NEVER had a worst experience with the most uncomfortable beds. Both myself and my parents who had arrived two days earlier changed rooms. Both the rooms I experienced, the carpet would have been more comfortable. The first, was so ROCk hard I needed to put the duvet under the sheets. The second room - I could feel every spring and again needed to put the duvet under the bottom sheet. My parents who had arrived earlier, also had changed rooms because the beds were nothing but shocking...moving from a rock hard bed to only settle with a bed that was softer, but needed to propped on either side of the mattress with cushions because it sloped outwards, being old and having too many people over the years sitting on the sides. Overall, great location, tidy, clean, ok service but dont ask for too much. IN SHORT - dont stay here = spend your money elsewhere if you want a comfortable bed...or even a bed that you can fall asleep in."
24,617,Aug 11 2009 	Lovely Experience	The lobby staff were very friendly and seemed pleased to see us.The hotel is beautiful with ornate plaster work and a feeling of oppulance.The hotel was very clean and our room very quite for the centre of London It was a standard room but very nice.The complimentry water in mini bar was a nice touch on what was a hot day.The breakfast room was again breathtaking in its ornate decor and ceiling.The breakfast was good too.All in all a lovely stay much better than The Strand Palace up the road even though they are of a similar price .My wife felt very special staying here which was the idea as it was our anniversary so loads of brownie points for me!!
25,617,"Aug 1 2009 	Nice hotel	I booked this hotel through Expedia. That was one of the problems I had. I wanted two rooms for 5 people. I know that hotel rooms in Europe can be small so I wasn't sure if any room would fit three people. One Expedia, you can book for three people. I called Expedia and they said no problem about having three in a room. I called the hotel and they said I would have to upgrade to fit in the extra person. I don't blame the hotel but it was frustrating to have to work with Expedia and the hotel to make sure I had a room for everyone. I had to pay another 35 pounds a night for the extra person which turned out to be about $230 US for our 7 day stay. The rooms we had were very nice. We were on the 6th floor in the main part of the hotel. If you book, make sure you are in the main part of the hotel. We had nice views from our room. The rooms were modern. The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. I have read reviews that complain about the staff but we had nothing but the best service. One small issue, wake up calls were poor and missed several times. I would have thought the hotel would have an automated waked up service. Set your clock, cell phone or watch if you want to wake up on time. Overall, pleasantly surprised since some reviewers didn't like the hotel. Great location."
26,617,Jul 30 2009 	Pathetic Service	Food and room service were pathetic. Even after complaining the services were not improved upon. Staff members not courteous or customer oriented.
27,617,Jul 14 2009 	wouldn't go anywhere else	i've been to this hotel so many times now that i wouldn't want to go anywhere else. it's in a great location for central london attractions. if you like to be in the thick of things then this has the ideal location as it's next to trafalgar square. the rooms are lovely; good quality. we were lucky enough to get a &quot;three nights for the price of two&quot; offer with breakfast included; this was from the hotel's website. it was a better deal booking with them on this occassion. if anyone moans about this hotel then they are too fussy! i love it and think it's reasonably priced for it's location and quality.
28,617,"Jul 5 2009 	Four star hotel five star experience	Beautiful room, luxiouriously appointed, spacious, very comfortable king size bed, excellent central location, with a great price off tripadvisor. One of the nicest hotels and best hotel experiences I have ever had. The windows even open, which dried the clothes that we couldn't fit on the provided towel/clothes rack in the bathroom. Had a shower/bath, fridge, cabe TV, bidet (for those who like those things), aircon, safe, working iron, plenty of closet space, and hairdryer. Recommended without reservation."
29,617,"Jul 2 2009 	Beautiful Common Areas Rooms Need Upgrades	I stayed here for a conference along with other conference colleagues. Frankly, of the rooms I saw, mine was the best. The big advantage of the rooms were that they were, in fact, big. At least by London standards! The bathrooms were nice and large, too. The room's decor was a bit on the shabby side, really in need of some refreshing touches. Also, major tip: If you're placed over any public area, you will hear external noise, particularly during good weather, as crowds gather in this area. The restaurant and bar were very nice, the service good, and the elegance of the common areas harken back to a wonderful history. Keep the common areas the way they are, but a refresh to the rooms would make this a gem. I recommend this hotel more for its larger rooms, excellent location, and very good food and wine."
30,617,"Jun 29 2009 	Comfortable Hotel in a Terrific Location	This was not a business trip for once. I'd managed to buy three tickets to Oliver! and wanted a hotel within walking distance of theatreland, Covent Garden and Embankment and selected the Charing Cross Hotel initially for its location. I booked the rooms the afternoon before arrival via the Hotel's own website which offered an outstanding rate of just under 80 for bed and breakfast. I booked three rooms and admit to having my fingers crossed when we checked in at 2.30pm the next day. I need not have worried. Check in was swift and very courteous; all three rooms were perfect for our need - very clean, very comfortable large beds, good sized bathrooms. Each room had air conditioning that could be set to suit - although the windows opened as well for fresh air. The one smoker was delighted to have a room where smoking was permitted and was happy to sacrifice a river view. I was concerned that it may be noisy, being so close to the station, but not at all. Our rooms ( two on 6th floor; 604 with two windows and a view over roof tops to the Thames and 608 with one window with a view over roof tops to the Thames and one on 3rd floor) were all very quiet.We were asked if we had reservations for dinner and helpfully offered assistance should we need anything. We had a wonderful stroll into Covent Garden and then back to the Hotel to change for dinner - see separate review for Sarastro.After the show - Rowan Atkinson's performance as Fagin was wonderful and well supported by an excellent company - we strolled around the area enjoying the atmosphere and back to the Hotel. We decided on a nightcap in the bar which was very busy, but we didn't have long to wait to be served although it took longer to pay for the drinks!Breakfast next day was excellent. We all had enjoyed a good night's sleep and were refreshed. Again service was swift and courteous. Great fresh coffee and tea and plenty of it! The breakfast buffet was well stocked an regularly replenished. It was a very relaxing breakfast service.Check out was easy and the concierge happily stored our luggage for us, collection of which was equally troublefree.We got a terrific rate for this hotel and were more than happy with the stay. The location of the Charing Cross Hotel is exceptional especially for theatreland and Covent Garden.We'd all recommend the hotel to friends and would be happy to stay there again ourselves."
31,617,"Jun 21 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Just returned from 2 day stay. Booked a delux room including breakfast and wine, which set us back 330, not bad at all for a very central 4 star. We had 2 views of street, looking up towards Trafalga sq. London main sights right at hand, Hungerford bridge, i minute London eye, 3 minutes big men 5 minutes.Breakfast was very nice indeed, fresh cooked and nice service. Hotel is quite grand and well maintained, staff are very pleasant and service is good.Rooms spacious, well maintained and stylish.Only had coffee and cakes so cant comment on the menue.Went for Bistro meal to Palm Court , recommended."
32,617,"Jun 20 2009 	Fantastic amazing great value would go again!	What a fantastic hotel, real luxury -little to touches like candles lit throughout reception and front corridor in evening. Fantastic breakfast and lovely surroundings. Staff extremely friends, could'nt do enough for us. Very central location for shows and Buckingham Palace. I would definately go again."
33,617,"Jun 14 2009 	Nice hotel shame about the service !!	Central location of hotel excellent for sightseeing, literally 5 mins walk from Trafalgar Square. Check in fuss free and efficient. Room a bit on the small side but with everything you need during your stay. Clean and tidy, the only minor quibble being that they cleaned the room at tea time, sometimes as late as 5pm. This is not what you need after a day's sightseeing on foot, having to leave the room while they clean it !!Breakfast ! Where do we start?First two days of our stay were good, with a basic choice but tasty. Tea and coffee served a cup at a time and by the waiter (when it was served at all). You basically had to catch their eye to get a cup of tea and sometimes they didn't bother coming over at all !Breakfast on day three was a joke, we were one of three couples in the &quot;conservatory&quot;, none of whom were offered tea or coffee because the waitress was too &quot;busy&quot; attending to a gentleman we later found out was her father. She hardly left his table at all during our breakfast, at which time none of the tables had been cleared and all of the guests were ignored. Could it get any worse?Oh yes !! Day four was a farce, the tables had been pushed so close together that we may as well have been on a table for twelve, having to move everytime someone next to you wanted to fight their way through to the buffet....and surprise surprise no tea or coffee offered. Not the standards you'd expect from a supposed &quot;4 star&quot; hotel.When we finally left the breakfast room there was a queue of around thirty people waiting to be seated.Hotel itself was clean, tidy and excellent location in central London but badly let down by it's breakfast service. If they want guests to return....they need to sort it out !!"
34,617,Jun 3 2009 	Highly Ok	Got a surprise deal on priceline. Hotel was ok not bad at all but looked better on pictures
35,617,"May 22 2009	Excellent Location / Beautiful Hotel	Stayed in the Charing Cross Hot London for the May bank holiday weekend. Myself and my sister brought my mam over to see a show for her Birthday. (Savoy Theatre) She felt so spoilt when she saw the Hotel. The location for the Theatre disctrict was perfect, only a couple of minutes walk from the Hotel. The hotel is beautiful, listed building, old fashioned. There was 3 of us so we asked for an extra bed to be put in the room as the did not have a triple. The room wsa huge, even with the 3rd bed there was plenty of room. The room was lovely, bathroom excellent. Absolutely no complaints about the room. The breakfast was a buffet with plenty to choose from, cereals, fruit, yogarts, fry up toast, all lovely. It is a hugh hotel so I can see how people complained about q's for the brekkie. But I have to say we only had a 5 minute wait one moring the other mornings no problem at all. The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing. Right beside Trafalgar Sq. The hop on hop off bus was just outside to the left so that was great to get the sight seeing in. Plenty of resturants very near by. We drank in the Hotel Bar one night but found it to be a bit expensive. 6.50 for a Vodka before you even bought your mixer! !!!I would definatley stay in the Charing Cross hotel."
36,617,"May 21 2009 	Fur coat - no knickers!	I've always admired this hotel from afar but, I live in London and have no reason to stay in London hotels. After a late night out my friend and I decided to spend some money and stay over in town. My travel service found a last minute booking at the Charing Cross Hotel - junior suite for the price of a standard double.The building is impressive, especially the grand staircase. Staff were welcoming and check-in was efficient. The room itself was large and pleasant, with two large windows overlooking Charing Cross. Considering the location the room was well insulated from noise. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean.However, there was no room service menu and nothing in the mini-bar except two small bottles of water and no indication of wether these were chargable. On inspecting the bed I discovered stains on the sheets which should have been noticed by room service. I've no doubt the sheets were 'clean' but still a rather unpleasant experience. It was late and we were tired so we ignored it. The sofa and chair in the seating area were also grubby. We decided to order breakfast in our room and wanted to complete the breakfast request to put on the door before 2am. There was no pen, or come to think of it, folder with hotel information. I called reception for a pen and it appeared within a few minutes.Breakfast arrived on time, but by the time it made it to our room ithe hot items were cold. The coffee was like tar and again was cold. Most irritatingly, the yoghurt was in a breakfast bowl with two side plates on top and it was difficult to know that it contained anything. Alas the yoghurt ended up spilled over the bathrobe and carpet!The hotel is ok and the price we paid for the Junior Suite was probably what it was worth. I'd have been very disappointed if I'd paid the rack-rate. When I arrived home and saw the emailed itinerary from my travel service, I noticed that breakfast had been included in the rate, but the hotel had billed it as an extra.I'd stay again, but only at the right price. They need to sort out the details, as it's those that often make the difference."
37,617,"May 15 2009	Well situated for tube/train/bus links and Trafalgar Square. Clean and comfortable.	Well positioned for Charing Cross rail station (next door) and tube station (opposite). Buses stop right outside to various destinations. Trafalgar square is a couple of minutes walk away. Maybe 10 - 15 mins walk to Leicester Square.The pictures on the website and the reception area of the hotel are misleading. I did not feel this hotel was up to 4 stars. I picked the hotel primarily because ofits location and the 4 stars. The trip was an 80th birthday surprise for my mum with my sister and I. The hotel was fully booked (apparently) so I could sort of understand our rooms not being next to each other even though the 2 rooms were requested in 1 booking. In fact we were in seperate buildings. We let mum have the double bed to herself and found her room to be clean and modernly furnished but very pokey. Our twin room was larger, clean and comfortable. The decor was perhaps dated but I think more in keeping with the age of the building. Both rooms were for 2 people but there were only towels out for 1 person and only 1 bottle each of shampoo and conditioner and 1 bar of soap. Yes you could request extra toiletries and the other towels were in the wardrobe but it felt like we were being discouraged from using or requesting these items.From our twin room we could hear a lot of noise from the street below although mum's room seemed peaceful enough.We didn't eat in the hotel but had a drink in the bar staffed by a young guy who was complaining about having to work late and that he'd been mugged twice on his way home recently. Yes it is bad that that should have happened to him but guests don't want to hear your troubles and hotel management don't want you to frighten the guests!While the location was very good I feel the hotel was overpriced and not up to the standard I expected for a 4 star hotel."
38,617,"May 9 2009 	Ideal location	Stayed for 2 nights with friends. We found this hotel to be fine. The staff were all friendly &amp; helpful, the breakfast both hot and cold choices were plentiful. I suppose the choice of cold meats &amp; cheese was quite limited, but there was so much food to choose from I defy any but the most awkward of customers to be disappointed. My only real gripe was that I found the bed particularly hard &amp; the pillows were synthetic as oppose to feather, so not to my liking, but I still managed to sleep well. There was also some work going on outside the hotel front which was a bit noisy, but that's not the hotels fault.The location is perfect for accessing anywhere, right nex to the tube stations of Charing Crosss &amp; Embankment. Easy walking distance of the river,Trafalgar Square,Covent Garden &amp; Leicester Square etc. We also walked to Tate Modern which was a nice stroll along the Thames, about half an hour. Yes, I'd say it was a good place to stay."
39,617,"Apr 29 2009 	Poor service not a four star - don't waste your money!	The public areas of the hotel are very misleading .....the smell of fresh flowers greets you, the Reception area is large and lavish, and the sweeping staircases all create a favourable impression upon arrival. Sadly, it's all fur coat and no pants! Unfortunately, my room turned out to be a huge disappointment. I have travelled quite extensively and this is the smallest room I've ever stayed in! The room contained one bed - a 3 ft single, even though our company has a contract for &quot;double rooms for sole occupancy&quot;. The room proportions were positively claustrophobic, it was literally 10 foot wide at most, long and narrow with a woefully inadequate window allowing hardly any natural light into the room, and with an unpleasant view of offices and rooftops..... There was no bin, which meant I had to put any rubbish/tea bags, etc into the bin in the bathroom. Little details you come to expect of a four star hotel were sadly lacking - no shower cap or body lotion, no pen or pencil, no biscuits or hot chocolate and no mini bar/fridge. There was an ice bucket but ice is only available from Room Service as there are no ice making machines on the landings as you might expect. Worst of all, I discovered a discarded cigarette lighter under the TV unit - so much for it being a non-smoking hotel, and it doesn't say much for the standards of cleaning when a clearly visible item has been left lying on the floor by a previous occupant! There was no room service menu or hotel information folder in my room. Having been to the theatre and arriving quite late, I wanted to order something to eat so rang Room Service and requested a menu. The menu never materialised - I can only assume it was too much trouble to deliver one to my room - so I went hungry as it was too late to eat by the time I'd have had to chase it up. For the princely sum of 140 the standard of service and facilities are shameful. I won't be staying here again, and will provide negative feedback to the booking agent that our company utilises in the hope that none of my colleagues are allocated the broom cupboard that was given to me! In summary, tiny room, lack of attention to detail, slovenly cleaning standards, dreadful customer service. I've stayed in bettter three star hotels, so I'd say save your money and stay elsewhere! There's plenty of choice in London and this place doesn't deserve your custom!"
40,617,"Apr 20 2009 	Great location and staff	Walking distance to most of London sites. The hotel is hugh so our room was quite a walk from the &quot;lifts&quot;, but nice well appointed room. Staff were not locals but sis the best they could. Which they had more info about getting VAT back. But did have good info for day excursions out of town.On morning the room above us we loud with alot of pacing about which showed that the ceilings do not provide much a noise barrier.Best thing about this hotel is it is clean with great location for local touring and for train to day trips out of town.One hassel about London generally is that you need to pay for internet everywhere, including the hotel. That is a hassle since you need to watch your time."
41,617,"Apr 12 2009 	Very disappointing	I stayed here last week, I found the reception to be very lovely, but my room was very disappointing, whilst it was large it needed modernising and the bathroom felt old and dirty, i'd had a long day and really fancied a bath but couldn't bring myself to take one!The bed also had some kind of plastic under-sheet on which meant I just felt quite hot and sweaty. The breakfast was late in the morning which made me late, and there were items missing from my order - quite poor considering I had already paid."
42,617,"Apr 7 2009 	The location is fantastic but the hotel is not	I have stayed here twice on business both times because of its location and I have been disappointed. The reception staff are surly and it seems to take ages to check in. While the reception areas, staircase, bar and restaurant are all well decorated and kept clean they are in contrast to the rooms. The rooms have old torn wallpaper and the 2nd time I stayed the room was tiny. It also had a very badly cracked sink and the toilet didnt flush properly, I reported this on checkout and the receptionist really didnt care.Small touches are not appropriate for a 4 star hotel. E.g. the toilet paper is like that tracing paper stuff that they made you use at school. There is only one bar of soap and one small shower gel (which looks like it has been re-filled) in each room. The towels are very old, hard and grey. The mini bar is empty (except for 2 bottles of water but there is no sign to tell you how much it is) and the wifi is expensive.Breakfast starts too late for a business hotel and the standard is not great. They refused to take breakfast off the bill even though the first time I stayed I was clearly checking out before it even started. When I was checking out it was clear that the person next to me was complaining vociferously but the receptionist simply handed him a customer satisfaction questionnaire.Overall the star rating of this hotel is too generous, if they took about 30% off the price and admitted it is a 3 star it would be OK."
43,617,"Mar 30 2009 	Location great but hotel standards poor	This hotel promises a lot on the swanky Guoman website. The Guoman brand vision speaks of &quot;designer bedrooms&quot;, &quot;sumptuous dining&quot; and &quot;up to the minute technology&quot;, the Charing Cross fails on all counts. This is a somewhat tired Thistle, and changing the name over the door doesn't instantly transform the hotel. I was offered an upgrade, as everyone is, and accepted a Junior Suite with a bottle of wine for 35. Having given the room a once over however I went back to the desk to take an Executive Room for 20 instead as the standard of the Junior Suite wasn't great. A wall light was hanging off the wall, a couple of lights didn't work, bedside lamps simply didn't exist and generally the furnishings were tired...certainly not a &quot;designer bedroom&quot;. Reception didn't have an Executive Room available so offered to reduce my upgrade to 20 for the Junior Suite which I accepted.Service wasn't wonderful at the hotel. The complimentary wine arrived only after being requested a number of times and on the final request still took over half an hour to arrive.Breakfast however was something else as this hotel barely has a restaurant. The room simply isn't big enough and the way around this seems simply to cram in as many tables as possible. When you add a cramped room with a self-service buffet you do not create a relaxing morning meal! The &quot;exceptional standard of comfort and service&quot; amounted to standing in line to get a cup of coffee as even this is self-service! Whilst I don't object to getting my own coffee, I manage it in my own kitchen at home most days, I do object to doing this when I'm supposed to be enjoying a luxurious stay at a world class hotel.Overall I can't recommend this hotel as the great location simply doesn't outweigh the many failings of the property. There are plenty of other options in a similar price bracket (the Charing Cross is certainly not cheap) which offer higher standards."
44,617,"Mar 29 2009 	Great stay in a great hotel!	We used to live in London and now visit 2 or 3 times a year. We have stayed in many hotels in and around the city, including the usual 5stars like The Langham and The Kempinski. The Charing Cross offered all that these hotels do and with the location added in it was spot on, we will be booking again for our next stay. The service we received was fantastic, no sullen staff or rudeness as other reviewers mention, and at breakfast we were seated immediately and were treated courteously at all times. We upgraded our room to a suite and we will do this again if we get the chance, loads of room and as we were visiting predominantly to do the theatres and shop, a sitting area was a fab added bonus that we utilised every time we were in the room!! Check in and out were easy, and quick ,and the bill pleasingly small to boot!!!"
45,617,"Mar 15 2009 	Great location friendly staff	Stayed here for 4 nights for sightseeing trip. Location excellent right on tube line. 2minute walk to Trafalgar Square.West End, Westminster Abbey, Houses of Parliament, Millenium Wheel, Buckingham Palace all nearby.Dozens of Chinese restaurants in Leicester Square area , would recommend Golden Dragon.Coal Hole Pub on the Strand ( turn right out of the hotel 5 min. walk) great selection of real ales.Hotel was great value, buffet breakfast very good, staff all very helpful and friendly, room clean, crisp white sheets and fluffy towels, small empty fridge in room, handy as M&amp;S food shop right next to hotel for stock up on wine and snacks. Only down side was that the room was tiny but we didn't go to London to sit in the room so it wasn't a major problem. Going back next year to do more shows and will definately stay here again."
46,617,"Mar 13 2009 	In the Heart of London	Central hotel within easy walking of Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, The Enbankment, London Eye in fact all the sights. Myself and a friend stayed in a twin room in the Buckingham Wing, lovely room, clean bathroom, soft towels, comfy beds, fridge, safe, hairdryer, tea/coffee maker and best of all a full English breakfast included in the price, ok so you had to wait but the queue soon went down and the breakfast was worth waiting for. An ideal base,a tip, if like us you want a quick but lovely meal before the theatre then the Ha Ha bar just around the corner from the hotel serves lovely food and nice wines ideal to get in the mood for a night in London. Another tip if also like us you are off to the 02 for a concert then walk across the Jubilee Bridge to the London Eye where you can get on the London Clipper Boat service which takes you direct to the 02 ( no stops, 8 return ) an ideal way to get to the 02 without queing and the same coming back, while everyone else is struggling to get on the tube at the end of a concert you can walk down and get on the clipper to go back to the London Eye with ease, walking back over the Jubilee Bridge at 12.00 whilst Big Ben was chiming was magical, if you want to make the most of your time in London then this central hotel is a great base."
47,617,"Mar 12 2009 	Great hotel for a theatre break weekend	My husband and I have stayed in this hotel a number of times now.We like to go to the theatre and stay over night and this hotel is ideal for this.Rooms are clean, nicely furnished with tea and coffee making facilities.We have always been offered an upgrade but have never done so as we arequite happy with the standard room which they call &quot;delux&quot;You have to time your breakfast well. We have discovered if you go about 8.15amyou walk straight in. The breakfast is not bad by any means.We have seen really long queues of people on our way out so we know it is bestto go earlier than later.This hotel is in a great location. Near to all the threatres, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Trafalgar square etc., If you want a good hotel this is it. We are going back at the end of March to see another show.Our only complaint and yes there does have to be one - the service in the Bar is terrible and considering what they charge you for a drink it should be great."
48,617,"Mar 5 2009 	Great location but with faults	Booked a weekend theatre break with this hotel included. Was very pleased with location and room - we took an upgrade for 20. The room was great, overlooking St Martins, National Gallery and Trafalgar square (room 420) very clean, large and recently refurbished - couldn't fault it.We only ate breakfast and this is where problems start - the wait for a table was 20mins and when we went passed a bit later was easily 45mins. The food was a bit so -so as well. Best to eat over the road in a cafe for 6-95 for a full english!The bar was part of the breakfast lounge - way too small and the prices!!! 18 for two drinks (spirits with a mixer) - this is included a compulsory 2 TIP. I would go back because location is fantastic - within walking distance to so many things and so many eating places but wouldn't eat or drink there!!!"
49,617,"Mar 4 2009 	Excellent location but lacks personal touch.	Booked on line as part of a theatre break with tickets for 'Oliver' included. Chose hotel for location &amp; wasn't disappointed, excellent for walking to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Houses of Parliament etc.Downsides were the signage outside made the hotel difficult to spot. The queue for brekafast was totally unacceptable &amp; the hotel attempt to off load this problem by handing you a letter when you check in advising you to go to breakfast early so you don't waste your valuable leisure time ! We had a drink in the lounge area in the evening but then had breakfast in the same room the following morning - it's a vast building so what are they doing with all the space ?"
50,617,"Mar 3 2009 	Guoman Charing Cross - great location!	Good Central Hotel Stayed at The Charing Cross for an anniversary weekend 27.02.09 for 2nts. Hotel position is the best right on the strand and handy for all attractions. Have stayed before as a Thistle Hotel and find now that it is owned by Guoman chain some things have changed. We took an 'Executive Double' room which promised extra space, free soft drinks and complimentary toiletries. The free soft drinks were one plain and one sparkling water, and no little biscuits or snacks with the tea &amp; coffee. Our fridge hadn't been cleaned out &amp; had the last residents dregs of wine in a bottle (room 358). But what was particularly mean and a small thing to a big hotel chain like Guoman was the lack of toiletries and extras in the bathrooms - not even a face cloth..! One tiny low brand shampoo and one tiny body wash product for 2 nights. No conditoner, no make-up wipes or as I just said face cloths. In booking an executive room it doesn't make you feel very pampered.Room service means a 5 'Tray Charge' which I find ridiculous in British Hotels especially of this size.This is a great hotel with wonderful buffet breakfast and the best location, I did enjoy my stay but Guoman group need to put on a few more wee touches to make it slightly more luxurious for it's 4 star rating."
51,617,"Feb 18 2009 	will never book this again	I am travelling a lot for work and this hotel is really the first one that I would never book again. The whole appearance, service and quality of the rooms don't match with the 4 to 5 star accomodation they would like to be!!Very old rooms: wallpaper was coming of the walls, bathroom dirty with stains. etc.single glas windows lots of noise also from other rooms/floors.Breakfast not organised long line to actually get seated, not a lot of varieties of food. Things did not get replaced so lots of things where not on the buffet like orange juice waited for 30 min and still did not get anything. Unfriendly people that don't know what they are doing. The only one that helped with several things was Tony the congierge.I booked via internet and the hotel from the subsciption looked fine, unfortunately this wasn't the case only positive thing is the location. People please take this in mind book another one. I'd rather pay a bit more to get value for money!"
52,617,"Feb 4 2009 	Can't hide its age	Like an earlier reviewer I suffered from noise from the room above (creaky and un sound proofed floor) which woke me at 3.00 in the morning for 15 minutes. My colleague in a different room some way from mine was also disturbed in the night by very noisy neighbours.That's the problem with a refurbed hotel.Breakfast was very average in terms of choice. Usual trays below heat lights, so not very appetising if it's sat there for long.I stayed here only because I was booked in by a client. For the price and comfort and quiet you can find a lot better.Room decor etc fine - but because of the internal noise I would not stay here from choice."
53,617,"Jan 28 2009	very bad food and customer service was worst i have ever come across	It was my wife's birthday and took her to Charring Cross hotel, others had said its not very good but i still thought ill find out myself. The customer service is very bad and the food was even worse, the room was dirty and when complained they didnt want to know. We paid well over the odds and aswel and i would recommend anyone thinking of going to the Charring Cross hotel to seriously think hard about it as it was really that bad. Happy Holidays Everyone."
54,617,"Jan 18 2009 	Brilliant location for theatre trip	Review of Charing Cross Hotel by Welsh Trip Advisor member I booked the pre theatre dinner package through the hotel website inc glass of champagne for our theatre trip this weekend.Pros: The location is excellent especially if like us you enjoy visiiting the National Gallery, and Portrait Gallery,as these are just a couple of minutes away from the hotel. The hotel was only a short distance on the Northern Line from Euston and an easy six minute walk from the Duchess theatre.I was careful to ask for a room in a quieter part of the hotel and in the main building (having read other reviews) and we were given a room overlooking the Thames . The room was an executive one and was roomy and quiet. The staircase is magnificent and the overall feel of the hotel is good.The dinner in the restaurant was fine but not exceptional, the views from the terrace towards the National Gallery were inviting. , The staff were courteous. Overall the hotel was as expected,in a good location and reasonably well run.Cons:Staff seemed busy offering upgrades as soon as people walked in off the street ! I was already paying a premium for our pre theatre package so they did'nt hassle me.The decor in our room was a little dated. The bathroom had minimal extras such as shampoo and bath foam etc, it was however very clean.I was disappointed to have to ask for the inclusive glasses of champagne with our meal especially as the stay was a treat for my husbands birthday! It did'nt exactly get the evening off to a good start when we had to wait for the manager to check whether the champagne was part of the deal !!! The quality of food was good but not outstanding for the price . The service was good at dinner but poor at breakfast. We did not have to queue but noticed that others did and the staff were not particularly welcoming and friendly. My husband was a little put off by the mould on the bread he was about to toast but this was quickly replaced by a fresh loaf ! I had to ask for staff to replenish the fruit salad bowl. There were a number of staff around but not checking as carefully as they could when food was running out.Overall it is worth a return visit because of the location but I would not book dinner, just look at this site for recommended places to eat in the vicinity. The hotel is fine and we had an enjoyable experience but it does not appear to &quot;go the extra mile for it's guests&quot;"
55,617,"Jan 12 2009 	spoilt by breakfast arrangements	great hotel location for all central London theatres, shopping etc and very easy to find from underground and overground stations.We upgraded room which was spacious, clean and well maintained. The only down side was the breakfast arrangements. Breakfast was served in a small conference room off the main dining room and the tables were squashed in like a school canteen in rows, as all the breakfast was self-service it was quite a sqash to negotiate past the tables. Otherwise the food was excellent but we had to wait in a queue to be seated."
56,617,"Jan 6 2009 	Perfect location and superior accommodation	Booked this hotel to be close to Drury Lane as I was taking my daughter to see Oliver. I have stayed in many London hotels and this far exceeded the others in all areas - including the fact that, despite being next to the station, we didn't hear one train!In terms of location, the hotel was perfect: we walked across the Jubilee Footbridge from Waterlloo station (about 15 minutes to the hotel from there) and we were very pleased with our room on the 5th floor. Very clean and comfortable and excellent public areas and pleasant staff. Also worth noting is that there is an M&amp;S food just outside and also numerous shops inside the station, as well as the whole of the Strand and Covent Garden.Covent Garden is a short walk up the Strand and even Picadillly is within a 20 minute stroll.To sum up, delightful hotel with great furnishing and attention to detail, (pretty scented candles in the hallways in the evening) clean and well maintained and I would recommend it without hesitating."
57,617,"Jan 5 2009	Over priced with un-attentive staff	At 150/room/night you would think this would be a reasonable hotel. While the rooms and areas appear to have been mordernised, the attitude of the staff dates back to the early eighties. Staff in the bar were rude, and at reception only intent on trying to sell an upgrade to a Junior Suite (probably because they knew the room they'd allocated would not be suitable give its pokey size! This could be a great hotel if they didn't rip you off in the bar or treat you like cattle at breakfast (which wasn't up to much so if you get the chance, book a rate without breakfast and fins one of the many reasonably priced cafe's nearby for good honest English Fayre). For 30 more i could have booked the Waldorf up the road - next time I will."
58,617,"Dec 25 2008 	good hotel for a citytrip	stayed here with my parents last weekend and one couldn't ask for more.pro's :1) location: lot of sites are within walking distance. otherwise there is a tubestation and a lot of busstops to get you everywhere.2) rooms are clean and modern decorated. they are not big but not too small either. i had a single room and it had a table with chair, a big study with a flatscreen. the bathroom had a bath.3)all the staff were very friendly and nothing was too much4)big breakfast with everything you could ask for set in a very nice ballroom...con's :1) one morning we had no hot water2) no christmas tree or big decorations (minor issue)all in all if you can get a good bargain this hotel is a good choice for a weekend london"
59,617,"Dec 23 2008 	Better than I was expecting...	My husband and I stayed at this hotel on a busy Friday night in December for a family party nearby. My husband arrived before me and checked in, and rang me to say the standard room was awful, small, dark and musty. Bad start.When his parents arrived shortly after, they were offered an upgrade to a junior suite for 35 which they took, and we decided to do the same, and although I did not see the first room, apparently the difference was astounding!! The new room (in the main building this time - not over the bridge in the annex) was huge, had a lounge area with double sofa and 2 armchairs, two large windows, massive bed, walk in closest area, dressing table, desk, and hall. I was impressed. For an extra 35 it was definitely worth it - ask for it if you are not offered on arrival. The room was bright, modern but cosy and I was really happy to be spending the night there. With the upgrade, you also get a free bottle of wine. We got our bottle, the parents didn't. The room was on the 3rd floor, and although we faced the Strand, we were not disturbed at all with the traffic noise, sirens etc. A peaceful sleep. On first impression, the bathroom was also great, it was large with separate walk-in shower cubicle, bath, large sink etc. Unfortunately the shower was only pumping out mildy warm water, but the bath was hot. I phoned down to reception straight away to complain, but they did not pick up! We had to head straight out to dinner and didn't have time to wait around to get it seen to. In the morning, we still had no hot shower water, the dial on the shower didn't seem to turn far enough for the hot water. We then discovered in our parents room, they had a red button you have to push in to turn the dial further round. Our shower did not have the red button!!! We told reception when we checked out and they said all showers should have the button. I wish we had complained the night before but we didn't have time and hoped the hot water problem was going to be a one-off occurrence.Breakfast was ok...expected more choice but the dining room was nice and we were sat in the conservatory area which was great. The buffet had run out of fried eggs and had to wait about 15 mins for a fresh batch which was a bit annoying , and then only brought about 8 new ones from the kitchen, which went in 2 mins. The staff didn't seem to know what was going on and it generally seemed disorganised.Overall a good stay but definitely complain immediately if you don't have any hot water! Would I stay here again - probably not as many other hotels in same price range worth a try - e.g Sofitel."
60,617,"Dec 18 2008 	Location isn't everything	Yes, this hotel does have a great location, but there are issues. Firstly, it's hard to get a quiet room here, because it's located on a main road and next to a busy railway station. I also had heavy footsteps from the room above. Worse still, is the dingy annex over the road which is accessed from the first floor. If they offer you a room there, think again.The food is only okay and both times I've stayed here the service has been slow in the Terrace Restaurant. Why are there only two staff here? The main function rooms/public areas are large and baronial...but cold."
61,617,"Dec 15 2008 	great location for theatre land	My Wife and I have just spent four nights at this hotel and enjoyed our stay, we were on the sixth floor and the only problem we encountered was the shower, it would go from red hot to freezing cold and back to normal every 30 seconds or so. we did notify the hotel and hopefully that problem will now be rectified.on the positive side the hotel is perfectly located for theatre land and all the usual london attractions, and it doesnt get any better for using the tube !!! all in all a pleasant hotel to be recommended."
62,617,"Dec 14 2008 	Great location but needs work	I spent four nights there on a business trip, along with three colleagues.  The positives: It's ideally located, right next to the tube (metro), and ten minutes walk from Big Ben, the Parliament bldg, the &quot;Eye&quot;, and 10 Downing Street. The complimentary breakfast is Full English buffet, meaning scrambled and poached eggs, sausages, bacon, fruit, cold cereal, toast, juices, tea and coffee. It's a fabulous meal in a nice setting. The rooms are reasonably sized for London, as is the bathroom. The lobby is decent, and the hotel decor is nice, while that in the rooms is decent. The negatives: All four of us had problems with the room temperatures. It was way too hot, and the thermostats don't work properly. The beds have sheet/comforters (sort of like a double sheet pillowcase with warmer material in between) on them, which would be fine if the room was cold, but when it's warm, I like my individual top sheet. I ordered one sent up, and it lasted two nights before the maid removed it and I had to order it again. Same thing happened the last night. All four were challenged by the TV system (you can't turn it on from the remote until you have turned on the wall power switch and the TV power switch. The charge to call the U.S. is something like $7.50 for the first minute, and $5 for each additional minute. There are two computers in a room off the lobby, but you must also pay for that. Someone pulled the fire alarm in the middle of the night one night, but I guess the hotel can't be accountable for that. All in all, seems like it could be a nice hotel if they ironed out the kinks and didn't try to gouge the customer with the phone and computer charges."
63,617,"Nov 23 2008 	excellent hotel	stayed at charing cross hotel for our 30th wedding anniversary we had a fantastic time room excellent ,breakfast excellent ,staff could't do enough for us. hotel very clean and in a excellent position would stay again"
64,617,"Nov 16 2008	Good Location for Tourists	I work in London and sometimes have to stay over if I'm attending late night functions. Some Central London Hotels - even expensive ones - are quite disappointing. However, The Charing Cross Hotel was rather grand, clean and comfortable - and in a good location, especially for visitors to the city.Within walking distance of Covent Garden, Leicester Square, the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, The Mall &amp; Parliament Square, it really is ideally located. I was worried that it might be noisy - especially as Villiers Street (leading down to Embankment Tube and the river) can get very busy at night. However, it was pretty quiet. The room was slightly gaudy (too many floral patterns for my taste) but the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The bathroom was also a good size.Breakfast was very good, and served in the 1st Floor terrace with good views over The Strand and Trafalgar Square. The staff were very courteous and helpful, both during check-in and in the restaurant.Overall, I'd say that the Charing Cross Hotel is a safe hotel to book if you are visiting London and want somewhere comfortable and in easy reach of most of the obvious tourist destinations of London."
65,617,"Nov 14 2008 	Factually Centrally Located Sadly Not Impressed	Arrived at 1:30pm when checkin was at 2pm, after an overnight flight from the States. Front desk staff (Marius) was rude and arrogant. The hotel had a line of guests checking in half hour before the &quot;official time&quot;, they were getting checked in and receiving room keys. I was told my room was not ready yet and to wait in a chair in the lobby until it was. Who are they joking with the UK economy in shambles, not a single superior room was available anywhere in their hotel 30 minutes before check-in? I had meetings I was already late to. I was told they could check me into a lesser category that was available but would have to charge the same price. Other front desk staff were offering room upgrades for a minimum GBP40 charge. After seeing this I went back up to the desk and paid the GBP40 charge to upgrade to a Junior Suite, which just happened to be ready. The upgrade came with a pullout sofa with ripped cushion, stains on the other chairs and two desks and a bed, all jammed into a tiny room. Oh, and a bottle of wine. TV was at best a 15&quot; screen and hard to see from where they placed it in the room. No CNBC no premium channels. Mini bar was a facade. Inside were only 2 water bottles and a big empty dirty fridge. I was on 4th floor of this 6 story hotel, and since the hotel is above a major train station, it did not get quiet until 2am atleast, and the noise started again at 5am. Maybe this is why they included a bottle of wine in this upgrade package? Since I never received the bottle of wine, it was difficult to sleep. Upon check-out they removed only GBP5 for not delivering the bottle of wine with the upgrade package I had purchased for GBP40. Perhaps they should have refunded the whole upgrade fee. Was that GBP5 for a wine bottle or a water bottle?Would never stay at this hotel again for business. Seems to me this hotel earns most revenue from hourly guests (given right above a train station and wine offer)and unsuspecting tourists, who probrably will not be back. If you are coming to UK as a tourist there are plenty of much better hotels in this price range around the same area, and the Strand and Charing Cross Station area gets a bit shady at night. If you are staying on business, make sure your firm never books you here."
66,617,"Nov 9 2008 	Recommended	Great location within walking distance of theatres and Covent Garden. Pleasant room and really lovely area for breakfast. The only minor thing that could have been better is that, as usual, hotels seem incapable of serving tea that is hot as opposed to lukewarm. Everything else was excellent."
67,617,"Nov 1 2008 	Great Hotel - Awesome Location!	On our trip for the NFL International game - Chargers vs Saints - we had a large group coming together from all over Europe. I wanted us to be central in London, but also affordable. By booking ahead with Lynn in the Thistle booking center we were able to do both. This hotel is so strategically located for travelers it is worth twice what we actually paid. Tube - Train - Cabs - Buses - Walking, it covers all modes. We didn't have to take a cab the whole time we were there since most things were within walking distance, or the tube was right underneatht the hotel. And the hotel itself was a wonderfully built and run operation. My room - they upgraded me for free to an &quot;executive&quot; room, was large and well laid out. My friend from Sweden chose a slightly less expensive hotel and said my bathroom was almost larger than his entire room! Unusual for London, and very much appreciated. The staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay and the cleaning staff were done with the room before I could finish breakfast! The breakfast buffet (included in our rate) was very good and complete - an easy way to start the touring day. When I'm back in London this will be my only option for a hotel - if it isn't broken, why try to fix it! Thanks Charing Cross!"
68,617,"Oct 15 2008 	great location	Stayed for one night and can throughly recommend this hotel. Great location; staff were very friendly, helpful and professional; offered an upgrade for 20 and got an executive room on a high floor with a view of the London Eye and Big Ben. Returned to the hotel after a night out and the entire main hallway, staircase and tables were covered in scented tea lights!! It looked and smelt beautiful."
69,617,Oct 11 2008 	superb location	when we arrived to the hotel we upgraded to the junior suite it has been the best hotel experience i have had in london the room was spacious warm and comforable could not fault it at all you get a free bottle of wine with the upgrade and mini bar is free soft drinks only though hotel staff very pleasent and willing to help breakfast was good to plenty of choice and nice and hot also. when you go outside covent garden to your right trafalgar square and picadilly to your left embankment and london eye behind you perfect location .tube station below you but no noise at all .did not want to leave if you visit london stay here you wont regret it . stayed for 2 nights 4th to 6th of oct 2008 cant say enough about this hotel but it was quality nice touch on the saturday night we stayed the stair case all lit up with tee lights and also main area downstairs beautiful cant wait to stay again michael and debbie belfast
70,617,"Sep 25 2008	Very let down	We were not in the main part of the hotel, our room was over a walkway in another building. The room was very tired, dark and dingy, and really noisy at night as we were over a pub. We felt very let down and felt we should've been notified that our booking was not for the main hotel.  We were asked if we wanted to upgrade our room on arrival but it would've been another 55 per night. Is this why we weren't put in the main building? (We had paid 280 for two nights already).The only consolation was that the location was central and we could walk to where we wanted to go."
71,617,"Sep 24 2008 	Brilliant!	Went here with my husband and friends for our friend's birthday.On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a suite, which we took, it was only a few pounds extra but 'wow'! Would definitely do that again.The hotel, and staff (apart from the Bar) were excellent.Bar: The Staff couldn't really be bothered to bring your drinks to you, left them on the bar, but the extortionate service charge was still added to the bill (this is not a tip as you can add those as extra).Paid first time without noticing, but the second time, no way, called the Bar Manager over to explain what the service charge was for (2.50 per round), he couldn't give a good reason so took the bill away and brought another over without the charge!The Hotel is very clean, not run down, the breakfast very good, all in all a very good stay and will go there again.PS just read the review about the bed bugs? Not sure if he is talking about the same hotel!"
72,617,"Sep 19 2008 	Good place to stay	I stayed two nights at this hotel and was impressed. The location is excellent, close to Trafalgar Square, the rooms are nicely furnished and big enough withut being huge. Helpful staff and excellent breakfast in awesome period dining room."
73,617,"Sep 17 2008 	Bed bug problem	I stayed at this hotel for about a week when I was over in London for work.The hotel itself is nice and the decor is fine but the room I stayed in had a serious bed bug problem. At the time I didn't even know bed bugs existed so I really had no idea what on earth was happening to me as there were so many bites it almost looked like I was allergic to something.What angered me after was the fact that the manager at the time didn't know what I had either...but being in the hotel business, I find it hard to believe that the manager has never seen a bed bug case before. All the hotel manager told me to do was go to a Pharmacy to buy some allergy medicine. Upon seeing a doctor when I returned to Canada, I was told that I had a severe cast of bed bug bites and had to take steroids to suppress them for a couple months.This review is a long time coming because for the most part, I just wanted to forget it ever happened. I understand that bed bugs is a problem for hotels everywhere no matter how many stars. However, I simply did not appreciate how they handled my situation. I did in the end, settled the matter with their insurance company."
74,617,"Sep 14 2008 	Great Stay!	Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in August 2008. Picked the hotel based on reviews from Tripadvisor. Our total cost (between two people) and including breakfast was 450 euro, this included a 15% discount from a promotion on the website we booked with (Hotels.com), which I found to be a very good rate for the quality and location.The room, a twin, was small but functional with a large bathroom. It was at the very back of the hotel though and was very tiring walking back there after a long day. It wasn't shabby like some of the other reviwers mention, I was very happy with it. The location of the hotel can't be beaten, everything we were interested was either within wakling distance or a short journey on the tube. When we were feeling lazy, it was easy to pick up a taxi as there were lots outside the hotel too.The only issue I had with the hotel was that they attempted to charge us for breakfast, which we had already prepaid when we booked. I had to show them my printout from hotels.com (luckily I had brought it) before they would accept that. Then on the last day, they tried to charge me again for it, but backed down very quickly. I would definitely return to the hotel when visiting again."
75,617,"Sep 11 2008 	Declining the upgrade gets you a smelly toilet	We booked through Lastminute.com for the discount, and when we arrived at registration, they tried hard to sell us an upgrade. When we declined, they gave us the most distant room in the annex, with several turns down a long, empty hall. The first night we discovered that the toilet didn't flush. Instead of a plumber, they sent a man in a tuxedo, who instructed us how to flush their tempermental toilets. They declined to give us another room, so we were stuck with a smelly toilet. The room was large and well-appointed, if a little shabby and musty (perhaps from a tempermental shower?) A scolding sign about keeping the shower curtain inside the tub was inadequate to cope with an out-of-control shower head with a broken support that sprayed full-blast in it's own chosen direction blowing the curtain out of place and sending water into the main room. The concierge and restaurant staff gave excellent service, but the front desk seemed scripted to an anti-service mentality. Charing Cross Hotel is in an excellent location: directly above the tube station of the same name and at a hub for surface buses."
76,617,"Sep 9 2008 	Great Location	This hotel has an amazing location. It is right above charing cross tube station (but you dont hear any noise from it) and just down the road is embankment tube station.It is very close to all the major attractions, it is 1min from Trafalgar square, 4mins from Leicester square and 7mins from Covent garden, these are all walking distamces. The london eye is just across the river and big ben isnt too far away either.The hotel itself is lovely, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is very good!Our room was one of the best we have stayed in, a huge queen size bed which was so comfy, big enough bathroom with bath/shower, flat screen tv and air-conditioning. I would definitely stay here again! The only problem I had with the place was that I couldn't stay longer."
77,617,"Sep 2 2008 	Why haven't I stayed here before?	This time I decided to spend a little more money than usually on a hotel in London. Location is important and I like to stay in the area close to Covent Garden. This hotel had very good reviews and I was not disappointed. I stayed here between the 27-30th. August in room 440. Location - It's close to the places I need to attend. Covent Garden and Charing Cross Road are just up the street. I arrived at Stanstead airport form where the train arrives at Liverpool Street Station. From there I can take the Underground to Embankment station and it is a very easy walk to the hotel.If you arrive from Heathrow you need to change once on the underground. The hotel entrance is right beside the entrance to the Charing Cross station so if it rains your hair wouldn't even get wet. Reception - Very helpful and asked if I wanted an upgrade. Room - Two bedroom de-luxe including English breakfast cost a little les than 390 pounds for three days.The room had: TV flatscreen, hot iron, trouser press, safe, tea/coffee making equipment, hairdryer and lights in the wardrobe.The bathroom had separated shower and bath. I was surprised that the hot water was instantly forthcoming.The view out was not the best, but you could see the London Eye.Unfortunately the room was as far away from the lift as humanly possible. The street noise was only noticeable in the morning. There are double glazing windows. As other reviewers have noticed there is some noise from the above room, but it didn't last for long during my stay.Breakfast and restaurant - Nothing was missing during the breakfast. The fresh fruit was mostly melon. If you arrive early you will easily be able to sit in the area overlooking The Strand. I arrived between 06.30-07.00 o'clock and there were not many of us at this early hour. I didn't try the restaurant at other mealtimes.In conclusion - The hotel is certainly not a usual London tourist hotel. It seems more like a conference hotel. The hotel is very elegant and seems well kept. The staircase is huge. At no time did I have to wait for a lift. Every one of the staff I met seemed to be happy to be a part of the hotel.I will certainly stay here again and I recommend it to everybody, especially those who are used to tourist hotels in London. This hotel is far better."
78,617,"Aug 25 2008 	VERY OK	Central position, very friendly staff. Clean, large room and very bright. Recommended"
79,617,"Aug 20 2008 	central and close to everything	This was my first time in London and with so many choice to chose from - I decided on this hotel based on its location and Expedia's special rate. I arrived early (before noon) and was able to check in early. I was offered an upgrade to a junior suite which included a bottle of wine. I took the upgrade and was very pleased with the room on the 5th floor - overlooking the front of the hotel. I stayed for six days - and never experienced any problems with the room or staff. I found everyone very helpful - esp when it came to planning trips throughout the city.Overall, while I would not hesitate to recommend, I much prefer staying in places that are away from tourist areas. It served its purpose as a means to introduce me to the city and the other areas from which I will probably stay. I would recommend this as stopover hotel for those traveling on to other areas - due to its location as being mile '0' ... (from which distances are measured from London)."
80,617,"Aug 13 2008 	Fantastic Hotel; Great Location	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights (Friday to Monday) for a break away in London. My partner had stayed at this hotel before and had highly recommended it. I booked online via the hotels website and managed to obtain a really good deal (125 per room per night including breakfast). All the hotel staff we came into contact with were very friendly and welcoming. On arrival we were offered a free upgrade to an executive room on the 5th floor. The room was large, modern and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was a good size and had a separate bath and shower. The location was excellent for our needs. Many of our destinations were within walking distance but the tube was on the doorstep if required. Considering the hotels location, above Charing Cross station, we were not troubled by noise at all, either from inside or outside of the hotel. Breakfast was buffet style and the food was plentiful and of good quality. We didnt take any other meals in the hotel simply because there are so many restaurants in the hotels vicinity. We did have drinks in the bar which were expensive, but I suppose that is to be expected in a London hotel.I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and will definitely stay here when in London again."
81,617,"Aug 12 2008 	Great Location	Fantastic location to enjoy the nightlife and sightseeing of London. The reception area was quite contemporary but managed to retain the character of this old building. Reception staff were very friendly and knowedgable. Quite a trek to our room (a couple of lift rides and a walkway away), but the room was a good size and had all we needed. They could do with 'chucking out the chintz' but we would certainly return to this hotel due to its location and the good hospitality!"
82,617,"Aug 8 2008 	Very very tired.....	We booked this hotel as a 'mystery' hotel on Lastminute, although we'd pretty much guessed which one it was from the description. It cost 120, which wasn't bad for a midweek stay. The receptionist tried hard to flog us an upgrade to the junior suite I declined and got a room which was took two lift journeys and long walk to find. It wasn't worth the walk - it was seriously tired, with a cracked sink, filthy single-glazed windows (on a busy, noisy London street) and aged, tatty fittings."
83,617,"Aug 6 2008 	Loved it	I stayed at the Charing Cross Hotel several years ago, during renovation...and loved the location...but not thrilled with the room. This visit was wonderful....friendly staff (they even remembered me when I returned after a couple of weeks for another night). I would go back any time"
84,617,"Jul 31 2008 	Is this the same hotel advertised on the internet?!	Stayed just this week. Looked at hotel website and was anticipating a very bright, modern boutique hotel. On arrival, Reception lived up to expectation. The common areas although a little in need of some attention were nice and spacious. There were a lot of original features in the hotel which appeared to have been well looked after. Bags were brought to room. Not sure whether the hotel is under refurbishment but we were taken into an annex across Brooke Street. This part of the hotel was definitely in need of some attention. The corridors had a strange smell and the carpets were worn. Our room was also in need of repair. Wallpaper was peeling from the walls and worn/torn in places. The wallpaper beside the waste paper bin was dirty as was the wallpaper behind the new LCD TV. The TV was a nice touch although the money would have been better spent redecorating. The carpet was worn with threads visible. There were two windows in the room which looked like they had not been cleaned (externally) for years. The room was comfortable and the beds probably one of the best we have slept in away from home. The room decor was very busy..... 'chintz' style, nothing like the internet pictures. One further disappointment was that the toiletries displayed on the internet were 'Elemis' which is one of my favourite brands but alas some sub-standard product was on the bathroom shelf. The pictures on the internet do not represent the standard you may receive when booking this hotel. The breakfast was good and the location ideal. When booking be sure to ask for one of the refurbished rooms."
85,617,"Jul 28 2008 	Great location Clean 	The Charing CRoss Hotel is a lovely old-school hotel with a great location near Trafalgar Square and the West End Theater district. If you are in London for just a few days like we were, then you really can't go wrong. The rooms were a perfect size for two, clean, up to date and quiet. The staff was helpful and friendly - we really emjoyed our stay here and would stay again!"
86,617,"Jul 17 2008 	Great hotel near all the theatre's and Covent Garden	Stayed at the Charing Cross Hotel whilst visiting theatre's in London. A very clean hotel, with great standard rooms, asked for first floor as l don't do lifts! the room was large, clean, double glazed windows...... couldn't hear a thing from outside! great selection of tea/coffee and complimentary biscuits! Breakfast was not included in the price. Paid 179 for one night which included vat. The hotel itself is situated right by Trafalgar Square so near to everything, bus stops outside to take you anywhere in London. Lots of Cafe's etc for breakfast, nice one opposite!For this part of London this was reasonably priced as l stayed on a Thursday. Would stay here again."
87,617,"Jul 16 2008 	Great location and nice hotel!	We really enjoyed staying at Charring Cross. It is in an excellent location right off Trafalgar Square and right next to Charring Cross Underground and Train station. There is a pharmacy in the building, and several pubs and restaurants within walking distance. You can also walk to The Embankment station in about 3 - 5 minutes. The hotel definitely had an &quot;English&quot; feel, which is what we wanted. the room was clean but a bit tight. Next time, I would upgrade to a larger room if budget premitted. I did like that they had our room ready even though we checked in before noon. The staff said Expedia had requested this, which was nice.Internet access in the room is expensive! 20 pounds a day. You can get free wireless access in the bar or lobby. If room access was free I would have probably given this hotel a rating of 5."
88,617,"Jul 16 2008 	Fantastic Location! Loved It!	Stayed at this hotel end of april for 3 nights as a base for seeing the sights in london and were not dissapointed!Hotel is in a fantastic location with everything practically within walking distance!Check in was smooth and although we arrived early morning and were supposed to wait until 2pm for our room we got our room straight away! The room we had was a smoking room and was spotless clean!Everything you need for your stay was there!Kettle, Iron, Ironing Board, Trouser Press, Toiletries in the bathroom, and a safe!Huge bed.......and really comfy after a day of sightseeing!Bath and shower!Train and tube station right under hotel and had no problems with noise!If you get a chance to see any shows whilst here i can highly recommend grease and dirty dancing! wow both shows absolutely amazing!Also went to madame tussauds which is brill! London eye is great too! In fact so much to see and do that 3 nights really isnt long enough!Back to the hotel! Really recommend this as the perfect base to do London!Staff really friendly!No probs here!Would go back in a minute!Only for longer than 3 days!"
89,617,"Jul 9 2008 	Great Location	Stayed at Charing Cross for 3 nights with my daughter. Room was an Executive type, bit small for our liking, but was clean and tidy. Breakfast was great. Fantastic location being handy to every major tourist attraction. Recommend the Original Bus Tour for those especially with only a few days to see the great city of London. Overall, would go back to Charing Cross as it was the location that won me over"
90,617,"Jul 1 2008 	Fantastic Location!	A great hotel in a great location. Nelsons Column was virtually on our doorstep and Buckingham Palace was only a very short walk , as was the London Eye. The hotel is at Charing Cross railway and Tube station so access is great. No noise in our room from the railway, which was very spacious (family room). The staff were very plentiful and helpful during our stay. The hotel is classed as a 4 star but I have stayed in worse 5 stars than this one! Overall a great place to stay especially if you can find a good deal on it as we did (secret hotel). We will definetely stay there again!"
91,617,"Jun 30 2008 	This is a great hotel.	This is a great hotel. Friendly helpful staff, excellent breakfast. Their standard is higher than some 5 star hotels we have stayed. The location is great next to the station, possibly a little noisy on the front, but you cannot be right in the action otherwise. A very clean hotel. We booked it through Londonhotels.com who really know their stuff &amp; give excellent advice on the city. We will use both again."
92,617,"Jun 29 2008 	Poor staff attitude	Upon arrival after a long flight from Australia, we were delayed into getting into our room by 2 hours after the scheduled check-in time. When we finally got into a room (not the one we booked but a lesser one) the view out the window was of a down pipe and the wall of the neighbouring building. Finally, after the unfit porter came, picked up and sweated all over our bags and moved us to another room again we were happy. The biggest problem was that there were other rooms similar to ours available the whole time, but the check-in people would not allow us to have them. The location is excellent, and the restaurant is good, in particular the Eastern European mater de, however the damage had been done by a very poor first impression. Would have accepted poor service if the price was lower, but I hate paying top dollar for poor service."
93,617,Jun 20 2008	Good not great... if internet speed is important -- avoid...	The good:Great location -- duh! Great first floor public lounge and barBreakfast was pretty good (although see below)Rates here are generally good compared to the Trafalgar where they have a bit of an attitude...Better rooms than the nearby WaldorfBetter location than the nearby Victoria Park PlazaThe free in-room tea and coffee set was good.*******The bad:The internet was so incredibly slow it felt like dial-up service. My upload speed was about 2kbps. Download speeds were something like 50-100kbps. The hotel seriously needs to work on this.My newspaper was not delivered either morning.Today's breakfast was missing the orange juice.Agree with earlier review about loud laminate floors.Mini-bar was empty except for some free coke and water. I found that odd.Good television (flat-screen) but no in-room movie selection.Bathroom was acceptable but showing its age.
94,617,Jun 7 2008 	fanatasic hotel canot beat its location	Myself and a friend booked this hotel through an agent as a threatre break. We were very impressed with the serivice we recieved and the room was lovely with a massive bathroom. The location of the hotel cannot be beaten. Buckingham palace is a five minute walk away as is convert gardens and the national gallery. The tube station is next to the hotel and oxford circus the main shopping street is only two stops by tube. I am booking another trip later in the year and will be coming back to this hotel. The only problem that we had was the fire alarm went off at 6.45 am on the Sunday morning which wasnt the ideal way to be woken up when you are on a break especially since we had to line up infront of the hotel in the rain and wearing our nighties! It was a false alarm.Any way if you want a nice hotel with good service and prime central location then book at the Charings cross you wont be dissapointed.
95,617,"Jun 6 2008 	great hotel	This hotel was perfect for us as it is in Theatre Land in London and we were seeing a show at the Aldwych Theatre. it has the train station on one side and the tube station on the other but we didnt hear any noise from either. it is on a long street with everything you would need, MacDonalds two doors up and pubs, restaurants, tesco metro, superdrug and topshop.the outside of the hotel is gorgeous and so is the lobby and staircase. our room was a double delux and was nice, not out of the world considering we padi just over 300 for 2 nights but i guess in London hotels are dearer and it was worth the extra money 2 feel safe and secure in a clean hotel.the staff were friendly and helpful although at times they couldnt understand our Scottish accents as a lot of them were foreign!"
96,617,"Jun 4 2008 	Has its problems	I booked this hotel using Tesco Clubcard Vouchers so checked in as normal swiping a credit card in case we had any extras. The room was a good size and you could just see the Thames and the Eye. The only problem was the room above had laminate flooring and the people seemed as if they were practising for a marathon walking up and down all night with high heels! I chose this hotel for the location and it is very central for all the West End theatres and Covent Garden. We went down to breakfast on the first morning about 9pm and there was a queue to be allocated a table, we had to wait about 5 mins to be seated, why we couldnt just find a table oursevles and then give our room number and name to the waiter I dont know. They seemed rather understaffed. I thought this might just be a busy Saturday morning, but the next morning the queue was even longer and we had to wait for 10mins.Check out was fine and they rescanned my credit card. The problem came a couple of days later when I received a receipt in the post from the hotel which was for over 350 which had been debited from my card! I immediately rang the hotel and they got it sorted out after a couple of phone calls, but beware if you are paying with vouchers, dont let them take your credit card details!"
97,617,"Jun 1 2008 	Location is hard to beat!	The hotel has a great location! To reach the hotel from the airport , simply purchase your Oyster card from the subway station and go to the Charing Cross station. The hotel is right up there. It's near the train station that is convenient if you're planning a trip outside London. It's near to the Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery. It's near to almost all the major attractions. We walk to Covent Garden and it's only 10 minutes! There's convenient stores next to the hotel , and some cafes and burger king right in the charing cross station (which is next to the hotel building). The room is good in size with ironing board, hair dryer , small table where you can have the free teas and coffees and crackers. The staffs are friendly and helpful."
98,617,"May 30 2008 	Lots of good points	This property is now managed by Guoman rather than Thistle. The location is very convenient, right on top of the Charing Cross tube/rail and 2 minutes from Embankment Tube, and a 15 minute walk across the bridge to Waterloo station. I have stayed here three times, in both buildings. The Buckingham wing is the older part, and while it is very classic it's still decent although it is starting to show its age. As others have said, the rooms there need a bit of TLC, trimming frayed carpet edges, tightening loose faucets, replacing burnt out bulbs etc. The other wing has a much more modern feel but the rooms are a bit smaller. The beds are decent but the last two times I've stayed the sheets seemed washed a few times too many. The rooms were always clean and everything always worked. The breakfast is in a beautiful room but is standard breakfast fare. The staff was very polite. This is a solid 4 star in London and I'd go back. I did notice that prices remained high, but on the day I was checking in, the prices went down considerably and I canceled my higher price res. and got a much lower one that included breakfast, so checking frequently may help."
99,617,"May 26 2008 	Still A Great Hotel	40 years ago, as a young man, I went to London to see Scotland playing England in a Saturday evening football match at Wembley. This was a last minute decision so I had to book a hotel on arrival. London was very busy but I eventually got a room at the Charing Cross Hotel and was very impressed with this quality hotel. It kind of set hotel standards for me and I always remembered it as I stayed in hundreds of hotels in my business life thereafter.I have stayed in London many times since then but always had hotels booked for me. I arranged to go to see Jersey Boys(Wonderful Show) at the Prince Edward Theatre last weekend and decided to book in to the Charing Cross with my son. We got a great welcome from the reception girls who were very friendly and welcoming and they looked like they were enjoying their jobs. They offered a room upgrade for 20 and this was a very well appointed and spacious room with a great view of the London Eye. This hotel is in a great location in the exact centre of London with easy access to Theatreland and the West End. It has retained its feel of refinement and quality and the staff are the friendliest and most courteous I have ever encountered. The hotel is also very quiet and the beds are very comfortable.Breakfast is comprehensive and the food quality is very good and the restaurant staff are attentive.It was good to see that the hotel is still excellent after all these years and I will definitely use it on my next London visit."
100,617,"May 23 2008 	A good London base	I stayed at this hotel for a short business trip in May. Overall it was a nice stay. As others have pointed out, the location, convenience to the Underground, and friendly staff are the hotel's strong points. There were a few issues, however. It appeared that they were breaking in a lot of new staff because on several occasions people at the front desk had to check with colleagues before they could answer my questions. The carpeting in my room was very worn. Also, the fridge had only a couple of soft drinks when I checked in, and it was never refilled during my stay. This did not affect me, because I never purchase beverages from hotel rooms, but it showed a lack of attention to detail."
101,617,"May 22 2008 	Excellent location	Excellent location and very beautiful historic building.Although during the booking some months before we asked a room with a view to Thames or London . They didnt promised for that but at least they said they would do their best. Upon arrival the reception said we need to pay 35pounds more for that type of room hence the hotel was not full.I always do my flight check inn by internet and use hotels free of charge internet systems however in Gourman they asked 6 pounds which was not nice.Room was clean and nice and they have an excellent breakfast. Location is perfect, just off Trafalgar Square near the underground."
102,617,"May 20 2008 	Excellent location	Always stay at the Thistle Charing Cross out of choice when in London for business. It is a lovely hotel. Staff are friendly. Breakfast is good, filling and plentiful - breakfast room also has fantastic character and decoration. Rooms are spotlessly clean, well decorated and have all the mod cons. Excellent location for tourists. Not bad on price for London.Would recommend."
103,617,"Apr 19 2008 	Possible the best hotel in London!	Excellent location and a really beautiful hotel. The staircase alone will make you feel like a princess all thats missing is the ball gown. A very elegant hotel with excellent rooms and a great breakfast. Our room had a great view on the London Eye. Outside, the front of the hotel gets very busy on a weekend but there is always a very nice doorman to welcome you and keep the young drunks away. I have been to London 22 times and have yet to find a hotel to beat this one!"
104,617,"Apr 15 2008 	Nice Place to Stay Happily Surprised	Booking this hotel without really seeing it made me extremely nervous especially since the name has not been changed on the Internet. It is Guoman Charing Cross not Thistle. What a nice clean room with lots of pluses I was not expecting.We stayed at the hotel from April 3, 2008 to April 7, 2008 and loved the central location of it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Always willing to give answer to any question that came up.It is not a place for young families or children and is kind of noisey being right above the Tub but I would recommend it to anyone. My husband and I really enjoyed our stay.Thanks"
105,617,Mar 21 2008 	EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE AT THIS HOTEL	We had an excellent stay at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it. Location is excellent just off Trafalgar square. Really good for both tube and buses.The air conditioning wasn't working in the first room we were allocated and we were given a free upgrade on reporting this.We found the staff to be extremely helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was also very good and the room was to a high standard. The only thing we noticed was that the toilet was difficult to flush on occasion!We will with out doubt gladly go back to this hotel.
106,617,"Feb 7 2008 	Convenient location high-class hotel	I stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross for 4 nights of a business trip. It was close to the offices we were working out of but also was central to the theather disctrict, Covent Garden, great restaurants and pubs. We were able to walk to anything we needed and the hotel was wonderful about giving us directions and reccommendations. Upon arrival they were accomodating and gracious. Unfortunately, because of our late check in and the hotel at capacity, I was given a room in the older section of the hotel. The heat was cranked to about 75 F and the thermostat was broken. It was about one floor above an alley and I heard people walking to and from the tube all night. However, the next morning I asked for my room to be changed and they accomodated my request, no problem. My bags were sent up while I was out for the day and they were totally gracious about my needs. We also got the free breakfast in the morning and were so happy to have a convenient, fast meal to get us on our way. Overall, my room was comfortable, I slept like a rock once my room was changed and was so pleased with their hospitality. It is a little pricey for American standards but worth it if you're looking for a convenient location on the Strand."
107,617,"Jan 27 2008 	This is where we will stay everytime we go to London	We found the hotel very easily after arriving at Charing Cross the location is excellent close to all the shops you need I chose this hotel as i was taking my daughter to see joseph at the Adelphi theatre which is a 3 min walk so it saved time on public transport getting back in the evening. (Excellent show) We had a great meal at TGI Fridays Covent Garden which is just round the corner from the theatre. When you come out of the hotel and turn right you can see the embankment tube station and on a nice day you can take a walk across to the london eye,westminster and waterloo.When we checked in the service was excellent the staff were very helpful and friendly our room was on the sixth floor facing out over the strand (huge hotel and a long walk to the room from the lifts) but this wasnt a problem as we just had a small overnight bag.We had everything we needed in the room,hairdryer,dressing gowns,lcd tv,seating area and comfy beds!! Large room Bathroom was excellent with a bath and separate shower. Breakfast was on the 1st floor and was included in the rate (buffett style and included cooked breakfast aswell) if you purchase it on the day it will cost 17.95 which even tho was very nice i would never of paid that much for it!!On entering and leaving the hotel everyone who worked at the hotel always said hello to you which is a rare touch at hotels and I found everyone to be friendly.This was by far the best hotel we have ever stayied in and I will always return to this hotel whenever we go to london i wish we could of stayed for longer."
108,617,"Jan 23 2008 	Highly recommend	This hotel is great. It has been renovated and its superb. I recommend it for its location, its standards, its staff, the bar, the price. No complaints. We found the concierges extremely helpful and very well informed. They called and booked restaurants for us, photocopied maps and printed driving directions and so on. I chose this hotel as I used to work in Covent Garden and know the location is great for sightseeing. The hotel is based at the Charing cross train and tube station (dont let this alarm you, this does not detract from the hotel - its a plus), just look at a map to see how close many attractions are (walking distance and via a quick tube or cab journey).We were travelling as a party of 6 adults and 7 kids. The infant crib and child beds were clean and had good bedding. There is a 'Boots' chemist/pharmacy nextdoor and another a few doors down which is great for supplies, snacks etc.Bathrooms were fine. We were in the traditional wing with slightly older but very comfortable decor (other parts of the hotel had been renovated) the bellboy who helped us with our luggage told us we could move to a renovated room but we chose not to as our room was a good standard and there was basically no need. I should imagine if you request to be in the renovated side its probably worth it, a new bathroom is always nice!The bar was a nice surprise, great service everywhere."
109,617,Jan 22 2008 	LocationLocationLocation!	I have stayed at this hotel several times before but not for a few years. The hotel has been extensively refurbished. We had a deluxe twin room which was in the Buckingham wing and was very pleasant. The staff were all friendly &amp; helpful. My only critisicism was that I only spoke to one English member of staff - this is sadly something that happens in hotels all over now. I recently stayed in Dublin and was disappointed not to hear a local accent in the hotel.The breakfast room is not as well set out as it used to be - more cramped. The food was disappointing - not as hot as it should be. The hotel has the most perfect location for exploring. It is a 5 minute walk to Covent Garden &amp; Theatreland. You can pick up a river cruise behind the hotel on the Embankment. Trafalgar Square is a 5 minute walk away too. The hotel is situated right by the underground and several bus stops. We took the tube to the museums but got the number 9 bus to Knightsbridge.If you are a UK resident it is well worth buying an Oyster card which allows you to travel on the bus and tube at a reduced rate(1.50 per journey). You have to buy one in advance as it has to be posted to your address. It costs 2 to buy and then you just top it up with credit. Visit www.visitlondon.com for further information.Drinks in the hotel are expensive - 7.50 for a glass of wine but its London!
110,617,"Dec 16 2007 	Great Hotel Great Location	We stayed here for 4 nights and had a great time. We stayed in a Delux twin room which was very nice. Hotel lovely, breakfast very nice but for me the best part was the location.Situated right at the underground entrance it was easy to travel anywhere each day. Also, the hotel is walking distance from Covent Garden which was lovely to sit in the open air cafes at night.Loved it!"
111,617,"Dec 11 2007 	Great Location compact room	We stayed 3 nights in the Charing Cross Hotel in mid-November. The hotel is pretty good. The room wasn't cheap, but probably par for the course. We were in the middle of London and despite being in November, there were lots of tourists around, just like us! Christmas shopping had started in earnest for many.The hotel is now run by Guoman Hotels, not Thistle.There isn't much on the ground floor of the hotel because of the railway station next door. There's a small reception, a lounge and a business centre. Upstairs, up a rather grand sweeping staircase on the first floor is where all the public rooms are located. There's a comfy looking bar (with free wifi apparently), dining room, a fantastically decorated breakfast room and several function suites and meeting rooms. The staff we met were helpful and pleasant. In particular, a duty manager, a Turkish gentleman, Suliman perhaps, was extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you.Our room was a &quot;deluxe double&quot; room. The did try to get us to upgrade to a small suite we declined. The upgraded rooms would apparently have a &quot;view of the river&quot; and more roomy. Maybe yes, but since the hotel is 300 yards from the river, with the station in between, the view certainly wouldn't have been be panoramic. In reality, we only slept in our room so the additional space would be of little use to us. Our room was quite clean but small yet perfectly formed. The furniture, fixtures and fittings were of good quality but perhaps beginning to show their age. There was, however, only one easy chair in the double room and, magically on our second day, a small side table appeared in the room too. The bathroom was compact with a shower over the bath. There was plenty of wardrobe space for a weekend's clothes. The big TV showed several UK and European TV channels.The room aircon/heating was a little temperamental and tricky to get just right, but we got used to it.We had extremely noisy neighbours, cackling and yelling their heads off until 4 or 5 in the morning one night. Their noise woke my wife but even woke me which is saying something. But other than these North Americans (judging from their accent through the wall) there was very little sound from the street below, from the adjacent railway station or from other guests in the hotelWe breakfasted in the hotel and it was very good, with plenty of choice of healthy or not so health breakfasts and lots of fresh and freshly cooked stuff arriving at the buffet every few minutes. As said above, the breakfast room is a resplendent Victorian masterpiece of over the top decor. Fantastic.The location was also perfect. The Hotel is located above the Station on the Strand, about 150 yards from Trafalgar Square. There are tubes, trains, taxis and buses going everywhere. Covent Garden is about 500 yards away. As well as the hotel restaurant, there are oodles of restaurants all over the place from  to , from fast food joints to swanky restaurants, greasy spoons to chic coffee shops. The Ha Ha Bar and Canteen below the hotel was a bustling, good fun and good value. The food was simple fare and not bad at all.Right next door to the hotel in the Station is a very busy Marks &amp; Spencer's Simply Food shop, ideal for snacks and drinks if you don't want to raid the mini-bar. There are several other small convenience stores around the hotel and station. There are lots of shops around from the usual high street chains to wee specialist shops. And there are several theatres nearby. However, we went to see a show around Victoria station and caught a taxi right outside the hotel within a few seconds at rush hour."
112,617,"Dec 4 2007 	Great Hotel	This hotel is clean, warm and comfortable.The breakfast was good.... coffee apalling though!The room was well equipped and the bed very comfortable. Paid 140 for my husband and I and this included the full cooked breakfast, which for the location was brilliant.Would stay again."
113,617,"Nov 23 2007 	Handy location	A very handily-located hotel on The Strand, in a Victorian Grade II listed building right above Charing Cross Underground station. Within walking distance of lots of London landmarks - Covent Garden, Nelson's Column, Whitehall, National Theatre, Cenotaph, all easily reached on foot. Also near to Embankment for trips on the Thames and lovely views from the bridges.I stayed for a business trip and this hotel was perfectly fine for the purpose. Staff were polite and professional, although check-in was very slow and a colleague was told by one member of staff at 1:50pm that check-in started at 2pm so he would have to come back later. A few minutes (less than 10) later, another member of staff happily checked me into my room. It was not a major issue but seemed a bit petty as the rooms were ready and we were all trying to get back to our meeting. There was a bag-storage facility though for people who arrived long before the rooms were ready, so if you were sightseeing and just wanted to drop your bags then that would be OK. The Concierge was arranging Theatre Tickets for some other guests while I was checking in - he was very helpful and got what they wanted very efficiently. The room; bedroom was average, everything you would want for a one-night stay including tea/coffe making facilities, ironing board, safe etc. Everything was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Pillows were gorgeous, if you like the 'sink into them' type. I slept well and woke feeling refreshed.Bathroom; nice toiletries in the bathroom and there was a separate shower cubicle which made it roomy. No magnified shaving/make-up mirror though so if, like me, you need to stand right in front of the mirror so you can see what you're doing then its a bit of a problem. Breakfast in the 'Breakfast Room' was the usual choice of cooked Full English or Continental. Plentiful and a good range of choices as you would expect from a 'chain' hotel. I think the Full English was 16.95 per person if not included in your room rate. You could also eat breakfast at the hotel's restaurant which cost a lot more and, looking at the menu in my room, was charged per item. I can't comment on value for money because my stay was pre-paid by my employers. I believe there was a gym and leisure club although I did not use these facilities.I'd say there was nothing that made this hotel exceptional, but the overall standard was what you would expect of a good hotel. If you want a stop-off in London which is well placed for getting to most of what you would want to see, either by foot or public transport then I would recommend this hotel."
114,617,"Nov 19 2007 	Unfortunate stay	We stayed at this hotel by default when we were moved from the Royal Horseguards. We were promised that this was a 4*plus hotel that had recently been refurbished. The communal areas were very good but our room was very small and disappointing. The shower did not work and the taps on our bath were very loose. Breakfast was included but we had to queue for 15 mins behind 1 other couple to be seated even though there were available tables, as there was no one to seat us! We were actually attending a wedding at the Royal Horseguards Hotel so did not spend long at this hotel which was a blessing if the poor service we recieved in the hours we were there was anything to go by!"
115,617,Nov 17 2007 	What More Can You Ask For?	With the most central location possible and easy access to 3 underground lines this charming railway hotel couldn't be more practical. The hotel lobby and common areas are polished to brilliance and the rooms are kept maticulously clean and are furnished with every amenity one could wish for. Be sure to enjoy the hotel breakfast at least once if your rate does not include it as the breakfast room is truly elegant. Many thanks for the hotel staff for their professional and supurb service with a smile on every instance. I give this wonderful hotel a 100% reccommendation.
116,617,"Oct 28 2007 	London calling	I stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross for 7 nights Oct 22, and I just read a lot of the reader reviews. Most people don't love this hotel, just the location which is fantastic! The location is really all this hotel has to offer quite frankly.I just want to preface this by saying I travel a lot 50+ nights a year so when things like not getting a wake-up call three mornings in a row, one gets upset. I had a series of problems during my stay, all relatively minor in the scheme of things, but at 188 pounds/per night = $400/night I want my wake up call. I want a heater that will shut off (my heat in my room would not turn off for two days). My tv didn't work, and I had a twin bed where my feet literally hung off the edge of the bed?! Upon check in the first thing that happened was the clerk asked if I wanted an upgrade - already from the greeting they are trying to get more money out of me - not a great vibe. If I wanted a King bed that would be 45 pounds more per night. I am 6'2&quot; and he puts me in a room with a twin bed. The hotels solution to my small bed problem: put the two twins beds together?! The hotel did actually bring me tv that worked (on my third day), the heat did turn off finally (on the second day).Lastly, the hotel is loud. I constantly heard the woman above me talking and walking (in heels) and doors slamming in the hallways. Other than the location this hotel is not very professional nor do they have their act together. The Savoy, about 500 feet nearby, is a bit more expensive at 260 pounds/night, but after my tour there I would/should have changed hotels for the small difference and a real funtioning room. Again, this hotel is centrally located, but don't expect much here in this no frills hotel."
117,617,"Oct 21 2007 	Great location fair value	Great central location. Room was comfortable and bathroom was fine. The hotel is expensive by American standards, but fairly priced as London prices go. Desk and concierge service courteous and helpful. The buffet breakfast was ample and generally good; breakfast service willing but not too skilled. We have stayed here twice, and probably will again if we return to London anytime soon."
118,617,"Oct 19 2007 	Great Location	We stayed here for 3 nights in September. The room was small but nice and clean. Our safe was not working when we arrived and after 3 requests to the front desk for it to be fixed, it eventually was. The location of this hotel was perfect. Its near plenty of great restaurants and was a quick tube ride (the tube is right next door) to so many sights. Our room was not beside a busy street, but close enough to still hear shouts from the street. We would recommend this hotel mostly for its convienant location."
119,617,"Sep 19 2007	Wonderful Hotel !!	We just returned from a week at the Thistle Charing Cross, London. What a beautiful hotel this is! I chose it after reading many reviews that said the location was fabulous and the hotel was beautiful. The reviews were right! The hotel was elegant , classy and modern---I knew the moment we saw the doormen outside that we'd picked a good hotel (for once!). We got an upgrade to a junior suite for only 30pds more. The English Breakfast was more than expected, eggs, bacon, sausage, croissant, muffins, fruit and much more--very delicious! The hotel staff were absolutely wonderful, friendly &amp; helpful people! The concierge, Mark, couldn't have been nicer to us, answering our many pesky and bothersome questions with sheer kindness. But the best part of this hotel was the Location, Location, Location!! Right above a tube station and next to a train station. We were surrounded by Starbucks and little restaurants everywhere and only a few blocks from Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus &amp; Trafalgar Square. I won't stay anywhere else in London next time I visit! I couldn't have been more satisfied with my choice. Don't listen to the negative comments. This is a beautiful hotel with the nicest people I've ever met!! I loved it!"
120,617,"Sep 15 2007	Excellent Hotel	Booked for 6 nights at the Thistle Charing Cross for 119 pounds/night plus breakfast. At check-in, I was offered the upgrade to a junior suite for 35pounds/night which i accepted. there's also an upgrade to a exec king for only 20 pounds/night, but you have to ask for it.before i took the upgrade, i did look at the double deluxe room that i booked and it was acceptable as well - it was about the size of a typical manhattan hotel room. but i decided to splurge a little bit for the extra room.the junior suite had a king bed and a separate living room area. my room however, faced the street and it was quite noisy as london stays active for most of the night.The second night I requested a quieter room. They actually have a quiet room category. Next time i'll definitely request it. It was a lot smaller than the junior suite I originally had. it looked more like the exec room. since quiet was a lot more important than space, i didn't make too much of a fuss even if i did get bamboozled.the free breakfast was quite good. eggs, sausage, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, toast, coffee, cereal, fruit, and deli meats. i wouldn't pay 17.50 pounds though for it when you can get an english breakfast for about 5 pounds across the street.the location was wonderful. you have access to the rail system as well as the underground system literally a stone's throw away. leicester square and picadilly stations are within a 10 min walk as well.tons of shopping and restaurants nearby. i ate regularly at the mcdonalds about 150 feet from the hotel since british food stinks.if i could, i'd actually rate this hotel a 4.5. Definitely a good value play if you can get a decent rate. walk up rates were as high as 350 pounds per night!!"
121,617,"Aug 20 2007 	Great Hotel for sightseeing	My wife wanted to book a quaint English hotel while I, as a frequent business traveler, wanted to go to a Marriott or Holiday Inn, something familiar. I had stayed in some of the other Thistle Hotels in the UK in the past and the Thistle Charing Cross proved a great compromise.I found the hotel slightly cheaper on a search site but booked directly with Thistle over the phone, the search site said they could not guarantee the exact room we wanted.The rooms were a decent size, much bigger than my last few New York City hotels. The room was very clean, the hotel was quite and the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. I really cant complain about the hotel, so much so that I felt the need to add my comments to trip advisor on returning home. By far the best feature of the hotel was the location, it was fantastic for anyone wanting to sightsee in London. You can easily walk to Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, Parliament, Westminster Abby, Buckingham Palace etc. The hotel is also situated very close to two tube stations. I found the tube very simple to use, much easier than in New York. It was clean and I always felt safe. We took the tube to the Tower of London, it was easy. We also took the tube late at night or when we tired of walking. We gravitated to Covent Garden and Leicester square for dinner and drinks on an evening.My wife wanted to see a show or two while in London, the concierge could get tickets for Wicked for 75 pounds, we went to the actual theater at around 10:00am on the day we wanted to see the show and bought the same ticket for 60 pounds, the hotel had put a 15 pounds per ticket mark-up on, for two tickets we saved $60.00 for the sake of a three stop tube ride."
122,617,"Aug 19 2007 	Outstanding location Great Hotel	London is my favourite place in the world and I go there as often as I can. Consequently, I have stayed at various London hotels, but Thistle Charing Cross has proved to be the best so far! The location is excellent and outstanding, especially for a theatre lover! The interior, with its Victorian refinement and subtlety, is elegant and beautiful. Rooms are spacious, clean and tidy. The service superb and fast. Last but not least, this is an exceptionally good value in every way.In conclusion, I will certainly stay at Thistle Charing Cross again and again!"
123,617,Aug 16 2007 	Ideal Location	Stayed here for a long weekend to see some shows.Location was perfect for Theatreland - the shows we saw - Lord of the Rings (MUST SEE) and Fiddler on the Roof were about 10min away.Just round corner from Trafalgar Square &amp; Buckingham Palace and Westminster within a short walk.Built over the Charing Cross Station but not too noisy at all.We upgraded to an Executive room on arrival for 35 per night - included a bottle of wine each day and was a very comfortable room which we thought was worth the extra - we effectively paid a total of about 140 per night for a double including breakfast and wine.
124,617,"Aug 5 2007 	Great experience splendid service superb location	Just got back from London after a 3 day, 4 night leisure stay. I have nothing but nice things to say about the Thistle Charing Cross. Here goes -- booked my room on Hotels.com for USD 180/- (which I paid grudgingly). Got there on a rainy Saturday night. They confirmed that I had a reservation but they had overbooked so they had no room for us. However, the manager was already on the phone trying to make other arrangements. Manager got off the phone, apologized profusely, informed us that he had made arrangements for us to stay at the Thistle Kensington Park for that night and that we could return to Charing Cross the next morning and stay 3 nights. He felt so bad he upgraded us to a Junior Suite! He then suggested we get drinks in the beautiful bar upstairs while he called a cab -- which we did. They paid (with a smile) for our cab ride both ways.The Junior Suite was excellent -- very well kept, beautiful bathroom with shower and tub. All the employees were very friendly and helpful. The nice breakfast buffet was only GBP 10/- extra. The building itself is a historic one situated right on the Charing Cross tube station. Great view of Charing Cross and the Strand from our room.All in all, my wife and I were taken aback by how far this hotel had gone to please us. And the location is unbeatable -- right on the Strand, within walking distance of the Tate Modern and the shops at Covent Garden, in addition to all the touristy spots. We will probably stay at this hotel for all future visits to London."
125,617,"Aug 5 2007 	Very Impressed	From the moment we arrived at the Thistle Charing Cross we knew it was going to be a good choice. From the reviews on Tripadvisor wed chosen the Thistle over the Kingsway Hall Hotel and we were very pleased with this hotel.We were met at the entrance to the revolving door by a porter who took my case, and left us at reception to be checked in. We arrived at around 12.30, and our room was already made up for us so we were able to check in immediately and leave our bags in the room before getting out to explore.The public areas in the hotel are all very well kept, and well decorated. There is a beautiful staircase leading to all floors if youre feeling energetic, or two lifts if youre not.We had booked a Deluxe Double Room through Superbreaks. From the reviews on Tripadvisor I had previously emailed the hotel and requested a non-smoking, high floor room, at the rear of the hotel in the main hotel (not the Buckingham wing) and the hotel were able to accommodate all of our requests. We had room 612, which is a modern decorated room near the lifts on the 6th floor, but far enough away not to be bothered by any noise from them. The view from the windows in the room was of the River Thames towards the Oxo Tower and the Gherkin, which were all beautifully lit in the evening.The windows were old style sash windows, but with an additional inner sliding pane to keep any noise out.The room was well equipped with two chairs, a small table, tea and coffee making facilities, Air-con, a hairdryer, trouser-press, ironing board and iron, a safe and two telephones in the bedroom. The electronic Do Not Disturb/Service Room display was clever.The bathroom was also spacious for London standards, we had a large vanity sink area, and bath with an over-shower. The sound from the TV is piped through to the bathroom, although ours didnt work. There was also a phone in the bathroom.Breakfast was lovely, served in the Terrace overlooking the front of the hotel, or in the bar beside the terrace. The terrace was a much nicer room though. There was a range of cereals, fresh fruit, cheeses and cold meats, and also a full English breakfast. All was self service so you could have whatever you wanted.We didnt use the hotel restaurant for dinner; instead we went twice to a Wetherspoons pub on Whitehall (5 minutes walk away) called Lord Moon of the Mall. There are also a number of good pubs on The Strand which serve food.The hotel is excellently located for Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Big Ben, The London Eye, The South Bank, Buckingham Palace and Horseguards Parade. The easy access to the tube underneath the hotel is also useful if you want to go further afield. We stayed at this hotel as we had booked to see Dirty Dancing at the Aldwych Theatre, which was a 15 minute walk up The Strand.We would stay here again with no hesitation.Hints : - Dont use the room mini bar  prices are high. Even if you move something it will charge the amount to your room bill.- There is a Marks &amp; Spencer food unit underneath the hotel, and a Tesco Express just around the corner on Northumberland Avenue, both sell food and drink at much more reasonable prices.- Dont use the room WiFi  there is an Easy Internet Caf just across the road."
126,617,"Jul 22 2007 	Great Location and (For London) Reasonable value	I stayed here with my wife for a week in July on vacation and attending my Son's graduation. We selected this hotel because of the close proximity to our Son's apartment on the South Bank, just a walk through the station and over the bridge. I found a good rate on the property's own website, GGP 140/night, which included a full English breakfast.On check-in, we were offered an upgrade to a junior suit for GBP30/night (Although they omitted to mention that this did not include the 17.5% VAT!) which included a bottle of wine every night, which is our drink of choice. I would recommend taking this because the room was, again by London standards, a very generous size and the room we used, 406, had been newly renovated and was very comfortable.We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, the location excellent and the food very good. Breakfast in the morning on the terrace of the restaurant was memorable for the light, bright location, the views over St Martins Church and the National gallery in Trafalgar Square and the buffet itself, which is excellent.London prices are simply incomprehensible these days. Last time in London, we stayed in a much smaller room in Le Meridien Picadilly, which cost GBP400/night. By London standards, then, at the prices I noted above, this property represents very reasonable value for money and we would recommend it to all."
127,617,"Jul 12 2007 	Great Location Decent Hotel Good Value	We stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross in May of 2007, our first time in London. The hotel is in a fantastic location, within walking distance of many great sites such as Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Covent Gardens, Piccadilly Circus and more. For first timers in London, the location afforded us many wonderful opportunities to explore. However, there was a downside to the great location: the hotel is so centrally located that we heard quite a bit of street noise from our room facing a busy street. If you're a light sleeper, you should try to get a higher floor or face a non-busy street.When we arrived, we discovered the hotel had a special deal allowing us to upgrade to a junior suite for a reasonable price. The upgrade also included a bottle of champagne each night, and we took the upgrade -- but not the champagne after getting a taste of it! :-)The junior suite was of a good size and well-furnished. The hotel is definitely older and the room showed wear and tear, but overall it was nice. Unfortunately, our toilet didn't flush properly; a hotel staff member came and the best he could do was fix the toilet so it would flush only after many toggles on the handle. The hotel offered to move us to another room, but we decided it wasn't worth the hassle. Instead, I ended up using the public bathroom on the bottom floor.The staff was very friendly and helpful and the concierge was invaluable in setting up excursions. Ultimately, we got about what we expected: a decent hotel in a great location with some inconveniences. Compared to other similar hotels in the area, the Thistle Charing Cross is an excellent value as long as you go in not expecting the best, but something nice to use as a launching pad to explore London."
128,617,"Jun 27 2007 	Nice Hotel....Room 818 bit noisy...read on	This is a nice hotel very central for all that London has to offer and literally on top of Charing Cross tube station. We stayed in room 818 which is a little noisy as it has the ventilation thingy humming outside 24/7 but a pair of earplugs fixed that as I am a light sleeper and my boyfriend slept right through without. The hotel is very grand - we stayed in the standard deluxe room which was a decent enough size with double bed, two chairs and table and good sized bathroom.....in which the sound for the telly is piped through! Did not hear the station at all but suspect you might if you are at the front but I may be wrong. Definitely would stay here again - managed to find the room for 128 on a saturday night but their rack rate is much higher. Staff were friendly enough but we only had one night here and did not use the restaurant or bar."
129,617,"Jun 14 2007 	Excellent Choice!	This hotel for us was in a fantastic location at the end of The Strand and very close to Covent Garden. A fairly short walk took us to the Aldwych Theatre too. The tube station being next door was very convenient and did not cause any noise during our stay in the hotel.Quite unusual for a hotel was that even past the beautiful Entrance/Reception, the corridors and rooms were in excellent condition and the lift was spacious also.Breakfast was the best part and was located in a beautiful old hall and it tasted delicious too.I've been to London many a time but I know where I'll be staying in future!"
130,617,"Jun 3 2007 	Positives and Negatives	The Thistle Charing Cross gets high marks for location, friendly and accomodating staff, and size of rooms and bathrooms. However, many of the rooms (ours, for example) are in an annex that requires two elevators and a long walk to reach, and the hotel--while clean--is a bit run down. For the price we had hoped for more, but then again, it is London and that means everything is expensive."
131,617,"May 24 2007 	great location but expensive	Me and my husband stayed at this hotel may 15 - 21.The location of this hotel is just perfect. The room size is decent for London standards, but still small for American standards.The hotel is clean and big and in spite of the busy location, its fairly quite. But we did hear people shouting in the street at times.Hotel is close to Trafalgar square, Covent garden, Piccadilly circus, Big Ben, London Eye, Buckingham palace. We almost never took the subway/tube, we were able to walk to most attractions, this way got to see the city and feel it.The service was alright for the most part - we did get 4 wakeup/phone calls(bet 12 - 5 am) one night when we never ordered one, this made us lose sleep on day. I've traveled to places that are very expensive - Tokyo, Paris, Hawaii, New York and live in San Francisco, but London is by far the most expensive place. This hotel costs me 360$ per night, and I would expect great room with exceptional service in US for this, but was disappointed to see a 3* hotel with okay service in London....the breakfast was included, but again wasn't comparable to US standards. My overall take on London's hotels and restaurants is its way too expensive for what it offers."
132,617,"May 19 2007	very decent hotel for london	My family stayed in this hotel in April 2007 for a long weekend. I had to book two rooms as we had our teenage sons with us. We were pleased to be given inter-connecting rooms. This made the floor space a really good size, with both rooms having sofa's and the childrens room having a desk and chair. The rooms were very clean.I would recommend this hotel to anyone as it is very central and the staff are incredibly helpful and polite.Contrary to other reviews, we had no problem with our billing."
133,617,"May 8 2007 	Highly Recommended!	Excellent location with helpful staff. Check in was smooth and quick and the hotel, although it must have been very busy, was quiet and spacious. Walking distance from all main sightseeing spots and for those who want to travel further, on top of 2 main underground lines. Used my Tescos vouchers for this and have to say was really pleased with the whole experience."
134,617,"Apr 20 2007 	Great position	This hotel is in a great position just above one train station and close to another. It's two minutes from Trafalgar square and we walked to Buckingham Palace, Big Ben etc easily. The rooms are nice but nothing special. It's extremely quiet even though it's a busy street. We had breakfast included which was nice but we stayed for 11 nights and it would have been great if they aletered their hot food menu just once. The lifts are really quick so you don't wait long. The only down side was the service. We asked three days in a row for the paper which they said we would get each morning when we checked in but it still never came. One day we ran out of hot water. We got two wake up calls we didn't order and the one we did order on our last day never came. Plus the fire alarm kept going off for no reason. Overall though the position makes up for lack of service and we'd recommend this hotel to travellers."
135,617,"Apr 11 2007 	Excellent Location	We stayed there over the Easter weekend. This is the third time that we stayed at this hotel. We stayed in room 902 in the top floor of the Buckingham wing. A bit of a roundabout route to get to the room but it was a comfortable, quiet room. Breakfast was good with a very enthusiastic breakfast chef who kept the buffet replenished and looking fresh. (Breakfast is only of value when included as part of the room rate. If you have to pay for it separately I would suggest that you eat outwith the hotel!) Waiting staff were very attentive.A comfortable hotel in an excellent location. Check on their web site for special offers ---."
136,617,"Mar 20 2007 	Great hotel in great location	Stayed for one night after booking direct with hotel in executive twin room. Room was great - spotlessly clean, nice toiletries, good facilities (large bathroom with seperate shower cubicle) and comfy beds.Location was perfect: we were going to comedy club on Villiers Street which was only yards away! Breakfast was good - buffet style with best scrambled eggs I have had in a hotel!Overall, an ideal choice for sightseeing."
137,617,"Mar 14 2007	Very Satisfied	We just returned from our trip and I wanted to share with others that Thistle Charing Cross was a great place to stay. The room was very quite, clean and the hotel had a great location right next to the tube. For lunch try Pret for sandwiches, good prices with lots of locations, one right next to this hotel."
138,617,"Mar 9 2007 	Excellent Experience	From the minute you stepped into the reception area I was made to feel very welcome. The Hotel is an oasis in busy central london. Perfect location for the Theatres, Covent Garden, Trafalgar square, Leicester Square and many other top London attractions.Obviously this Hotel was built as an Hotel and the inner decor shows this splendidly. Very grand indeed. The rooms were tastefully decorated, some modern, some more traditional style, but never tacky. Beds very comfortable too.Breakfast alos of top quality and loads of choice. Really can't say a bad word about it.Highly recommended."
139,617,"Mar 5 2007 	Great Room and Location	Excellent location just above the tube/train station right on The Strand.Its near lots of shops and restaurants and not far from the theatre which was my main reason for this trip.The lobby are staircase are elegant. The staff could have been a little more friendly. Upon checkout I was asked if I had taken anything from the minibar. When I said no, the receptionist replied &quot;really, nothing at all?&quot; I was annoyed that my first answer was questioned! Apart from that I had a good stay.The room I had booked was a twin executive on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel which meant it was really quiet. The room was spacious, with an extra little dressing area which a door that led to an adjoining bedroom. The bathroom had a full bath, a separate shower and was clean, bright and a pair of slippers and robe was provided. Though why they only supplied one set for a twin room was a mystery. There was a TV and mini hi-fi, good selection of teas and coffee as well as a bottle of mineral water.The room rate I paid was 128 which was reasonable for this standard in London but breakfast was not included which was extremely expensive at 17 so we went to a cafe nearby. There is a great fruit stall just outside at the entrance to Charing Cross."
140,617,"Mar 2 2007	Great Location!	This hotel was in a great location! Walking distance to shops, restaurants, the tube and Trafalgar Square &amp; Leicester Square. As expected, the room was small by American standards. However, it was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was larger than expected. The staff was helpful and check-in &amp; check-out was a breeze. I would definitely stay here again."
141,617,"Feb 28 2007	Very Comfortable Perfect Location!	Stayed here Feb 17 - 23, 2007. The room was small by American standards, but Very comfortable and completely met our needs. We were coming from 10 days in India so a soft bed, clean restroom and shower, and clean hot water was truly welcome. I was concerned ahead of time that with the hotel sitting on top of the train station it might be noisy, but not so.The hotel seems to cater to business travelers, but for tourists the location couldn't be better. London is such a dynamic city and this hotel puts you only a few minutes walking distance to everything. And what isn't easy walking distance is a quick Tube ride from right outside the front door.The only downside was that our great promotional rate for the room did not include breakfast. After our first morning breakfast bill of $65 for the two of us, we decided to eat out of the hotel the rest of the time. But with the shops and restaurants of the west end just a few blocks away, it wasn't a problem at all. The staff was friendly and helpful, check-in and out was a breeze and we'd go back here in a heartbeat simply because of it's fantastic location as a launching point the this great city.D. MillerLos Angeles, USA"
142,617,"Feb 27 2007 	Very convenient for many attractions	I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend during a London sight seeing holiday. We stayed in Rm 432, a junior suite (however did get it at reduced rate due to contacts).The room was great, fairly big and was at the front of the hotel overlooking the Strand. It was a bit noisy at night if you're not used to city noise however a pair of earplugs did the trick. The actual hotel itself was very quite, not the usual banging of doors that you get in most hotels at night.The cleaning lady did forget to replace our toiletries most days, but if we asked we got what we needed so it wasn't a problem.Breakfast was standard Thistle fayre which is actually pretty good with plenty of choice and always fresh fruit available. The serving staff did seem to have some problems in bringing you more than three halves of toast but again, if you ask then you eventually get what you're after!The location is brilliant, minutes away from restuarants, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, galleries etc etc.All in all, a good hotel for a sight seeing base."
143,617,"Feb 5 2007 	Good but ask for certain rooms/locations	I had to stay at this hotel as we were having a corporate event there the following day. Although my two colleagues were put in rooms very close to each other, I was placed in the far side of the building, having to go up to the first floor, across to the other wing, then back down in the lift before I arrived at my room. Room 800 is a room right next door to the lift. The room itself was fine, the bed was nice, but for 160 it was a complete rip off - I suppose you pay that price for the location. The iron and ironing board was one of those fixed ones in a cupboard behind the room's main door. Obviously designed and installed by someone with no common sense, as in order to stand and iron you had to squeeze in between the iron board and the room door, with the cupboard door permanently bashing against your arm as it was trying to close back into place. Once I got into bed with the television off, I could clearly hear the lift going up and down all evening. All in all the place was ok but my main tips would be - ask if you can be located in the main hotel, NOT the Buckingham wing. Also stay away from room 800 at all costs! The staff were all extremely helpful and polite and gave us 50 off the room cost when our office manager complained to the hotel about my room when I returned from the business trip."
144,617,"Feb 3 2007 	Delighted!	We chose the Thistle Charing Cross for a birthday weekend in London after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and were delighted by all aspects of our stay. Check in and check out were excellent experiences and all the staff we encountered were friendly, well-trained and efficient. Our advance request for a high floor room had been met and our room was lovely and very quiet (we had booked an Executive double, which was situated in the wing behind the Strand). Furniture and fittings were of a high standard, there was an iron and a fold-out ironing board, a room safe at head height and an electronic sign for Please Do Not Disturb/Please Make Up The Room instead of the usual card to hang on the doorknob. Our requested newspaper was outside the door early each morning. The hotels location is ideal for Theatreland and Covent Garden, both of which are just a short walk away. It is also excellent sited for taxis, being next to and above Charing Cross station where they are constantly arriving. There are shops at the station that sell all essentials and a branch of Marks &amp; Spencer which stays open until midnight. In the room there were occasional very minor sounds from trains but this was not disturbing at all.Breakfast was included in the price and was served in a most imposing room. Although it was very busy on the Sunday morning, our tea/coffee and toast order was taken and delivered promptly and the hot buffet items were constantly replenished.There was a fire alarm at 3.00 am one morning and the evacuation was supervised professionally and courteously by the staff on duty. Despite being in the middle of the night, everyone knew what they had to do and did it well. Although fortunately it was a false alarm (caused by a guest smoking in a non-smoking room), the way in which it was handled was very reassuring.We made positive comment about our stay on departure and the check out/concierge staff were visibly appreciative of this.We will definitely return to this hotel and did not want to leave!"
145,617,"Dec 31 2006	Great Mini-Break in London	We have just enjoyed a short break in London at the Thistle Hotel, Charing Cross. We booked it via Expedia, which provided a cheaper deal. As a family of two parents and two teenagers (boy and girl), we wanted two twin rooms. Unfortunately, due to the hotel being full of American school marching bands (here for the New Year's Day parade), there were no twins available.After much discussion, we ended up in two junior suites, thanks to a free upgrade, with double/kingsize beds The staff were very courteous and apologetic, pointing out that one should always confirm bookings to secure the facilities/special requests desired.The rooms were in the main building and refreshingly modern (hate chintz),. Tho' overlooking the Strand, it was very quiet.As previous guests have pointed out, the hotel is in a great location, ideal for trips to the theatre, Covent Garden and a boat ride.Breakfast was taken at the Starbucks across the road and there are plenty of grocery shops for supplies such as mineral water. DO NOT TOUCH the minibar!Would definitely stay here again."
146,617,"Dec 8 2006 	Good hotel great location	This is the 4th time I've stayed at this hotel and it has never let me down. Check in is always courteous and we normally get allocated a room straight away even though we usually arrive early.The rooms have varied in size but they're always clean and the bathrooms very good. There's tea and coffee making facilities and hair dryer, safe and ironing board.The best thing about this hotel is its location. 2 minutes to Trafalgar Square, 5 minutes from Covent Garden, probably 10 mins to Leicester Square and China town.For central London, I haven't found anywhere better when based on value and location."
147,617,"Dec 6 2006 	Wonderful English Hotel	We had a five night stay at the Thistle Charing Cross. I have no complaints about anything. The room was smaller than USA hotel rooms but it was comfortable, quiet, and nicely decorated. It was great having an espresso machine in the room. If or when I return, I will be staying here."
148,617,"Nov 28 2006 	LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION ( London Lovers from Miami)	BOTTOM LINE: - For the price, location and the dcor/amenities of this hotel, it is without doubt one of the VERY BEST Hotels (if not the best) to stay in London as a Tourist.LOCATION: - The hotel is located above the Charring Cross Station in Covent Garden. For starters, Trafalgar Square is right across from the hotel. Secondly, from the hotel the London Eye, Westminster Abbey, The Parliament, the Theaters of the West End, Soho, Piccadilly Circle, and the Royal Festival Hall are about 10 15 minutes walk away. Buckingham Palace, the main stores of Oxford Street and the Tate Modern Museum are 20 30 minutes walk away. In addition, the host of restaurants, retail stores and quick food shops of Covent Gardens and the Charring Cross Railroad Station are at your doorstep. Also, at your doorstep, are the Tube/Subway, Railroad Station and every London Bus you will need to get around the City. (Note: The Bus is the best way to see the London. Buy an Oyster Pass and go riding. Recommend you start with the No 11.). AGAIN, YOU CANNOT ASK FOR A BETTER LOCATION. HOTEL PROPERTY  The hotel was nicely appointed and our room was quite large compared to the standard hotel room in London. (Remember that the average hotel room in London is 1/3 smaller than in the US.) We stayed in the newer Art Deco side of the hotel, which was beautiful in Dcor and Style. The bed in our room was large and VERY COMFORTABLE (Again not the norm for London). The hotel is rated as a Four Star hotel and does fulfill the rating.CONS- The following are only MINOR Flaws but they are worth mentioning: Breakfast  If you do not get this as a free perk in your package do not buy the Continental or especially the British Breakfast. In general, by typical American standards, the British Full Course Breakfast is awful and the breakfast at the Charring Cross falls into the typical pattern. Best Bet  Walk down the side street at the right of the hotel and you will find several charming spots offering good breakfast choices at a reasonable price. Noise - we stayed at the back at the hotel so we did not hear the any possible noise from the Strand, which is one of the busiest streets in London. 24/7. However, we did hear the slight rumble of the train on an occasional basis, but this was not loud enough to disturb our sleep or rest in anyway. The only disturbing noise we experienced was the banging from other guests closing their room doors. This is a universal problem at most hotels and not only at the Thistle Charring Cross. Dont know why hotels cannot add a closing spring/device that &quot;gently&quot; closes their hotel room doors. AGAIN - THIS IS THE HOTEL TO STAY IN LONDON FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE VACATION."
149,617,"Nov 28 2006 	Would not Stay here again or recommend!	My husband and I spent our last two nights in London at this hotel. We decided to try this hotel based on the excellent reviews we read on Tripadvisor. Sadly, our experience was the complete opposite. I am not 100% sure that you get the same service if you use an online booking site, however, they didn't have our reservation right.We had decided to &quot;splash&quot; out and book an executive room. They tried to put us in a double room then argue with us until we provided a print off of our reservation. They sent us to room 804 in the Buckingham wing - an odious and confusing journey dragging our bags all through hells half acre to get there. The curtains were grey with smoke and the room overlooked Villiers street, with a nice little ledge for someone to jump onto and break into the room. The windows are about 100 years old in this room. So, we called and had our room switched. We were moved to a smaller room that was on the 5th floor. 888. This floor was a non smoking floor but it smelled very strange.Our bathroom light was broken, it kept flicking on and off. We called to have it fixed, but they never fixed it. The alarm on the TV also went off 5 times that morning and we couldn't turn it off. However, the next day when we went to set it, it didn't go off at all.When we had initially checked in they told us we would get a daily complimentary paper - NOPE! We had to call for the paper,, and on the second day, after waiting for an hour, they actually tried to charge me for it as they couldn't find our file in the system...so, does that mean we were just essentially squatting there? Furthermore, when we tried to make an outbound call, our phone was blocked, apparently they had lost our credit card information. Horrible. I would not ever recommend this hotel to anyone. It is a run down dump, unless you get it for free - forget it!"
150,617,"Nov 12 2006 	Best Location for Sightseeing!!!	I booked this hotel based entirely on the fact that many reviewers here mention the location as being fantastic, and they were right. We were absolutely delighted with the fact that we were right on 2 tube lines; Charing Cross and Embankment. Only 2 stops to Oxford circus and Regent Street shopping and just a couple more stops to places like the Planetarium and Madame Toussauds. We were within walking distance of The London Eye, London Aquarium, Big Ben, Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Theatreland (walked to Spamalot!) Soho and Chinatown. By walking distance I do mean just that, no more than a half mile to anything I just mentioned. Buckingham Palace was only about a mile away if that. We rarely took a taxi and when we did it was just because we were too lazy to walk the hundred feet to the tube station and too lazy to deal with all the stairs in the stations! Shows that were playing nearby were Spamalot, The Producers, Stomp, Avenue Q, Evita, Lion King and a few more, we almost bought tickets on the spot as we just happened to be walking by so often.As for the hotel I thought I was great. It does seem from the other reviews and photos here that the rooms in the Buckingham wing are a lot smaller and in a different style to those in the main building where we stayed ( for 5 nights). Our room was of a decent size by London standards, very clean, modern and bright with a small commercial-grade espresso machine lurking in the corner! The room was fitted with all the usual equipment; kettle, mini bar, wifi connection, safe, ironing board etc. The bathroom in our room was ENORMOUS! Could not get over it, you could have added another bed in there : ) King sized bed was very comfortable.The only few little things that bothered me were: our key was tempermental, had to change it several times. No turn-down service offered. Housekeeping was OK but not great. The STUPID revolving door as you enter makes no sense if you are lugging one big, or heaven forbid two, suitcases as they get stuck in the door and you end up looking like an idiot as you struggle to free them, yourself, your purse and your umbrella from it's vice-like grip! (much to the endless amusement of the reception staff I might add!) Lol, oh the memories....."
151,617,"Nov 8 2006 	Except for the phone charges...	My experience with the Charing Cross Hotel was excellent. Even though I was on a Priceline bid, they upgraded me to the deluxe king room. It was huge, quiet, and very comfortable. I loved the bed!Everyone I dealt with at the hotel was friendly. As others have mentioned, the location can't be beat. When I was there, it was warm and humid so the air-conditioned room was a welcome retreat.The problem? I used the hotel room phone in an emergency situation to call home. The hotel charged me about $10 for five calls. But when I got my charge card bill, another entity had charged me almost $200 for less than ten minutes of calls. The hotel sent me a nice response to my complaint, but essentially said it was not their problem. But why do they contract with such a price-gouging firm? It doesn't show much respect for their guests and marred an otherwise delightful experience.I still give them a good recommendation. Just don't use the phone!"
152,617,"Nov 4 2006 	Great location-Okay value	This hotel is all about location. You are literally in the heart of London. We stayed here on a priceline bid of $85 which is a great value. Asked for 2 adjacant rooms, were alloted 2 rooms in the Buckingham Wing 823 and 846. The lady at he counter ensured they were on the same floor, 6th. Turns out one was on the first floor and the other on ground. The rooms are tiny and have a very old worldly feel to them. The promised &quot;coffee making equipment&quot; was missung and on enquiring was told that it didnt come with &quot;that room&quot;. I dont know if it was a reference to the priceline booking but I really didnt care since the first shop ont he street next door sold cappacinos for 69 pence. The bathroom is of decent size though to mee the toiletries were pretty bad. The bath soap didnt smell pleasant at all and I used my own shower gel thru the stay. Its a good hotel to crash after busy London sight-seeing but please dont get stuck in the Buckingham wing."
153,617,"Oct 28 2006 	Acceptable but poor value	This hotel is OK. No more, no less. Plus points:- It's conveniently located for a number of visitor attractions, shops and businesses.- The central areas are comfortable and impressive. The bars and dining rooms are quite impressive- Generally friendly and attentive service, particularly at breakfast- Given that it is right next to a large station and some of the busiest roads in London, it is quiet in the rooms.Minus points- For what you get, the value is not great- Poor range at breakfast e.g semi skimmed milk only, 1 type of fruit.- No gym or pool- Non-smoking rooms often smell of stale smokeRooms.There are two types of rooms - modernish ones with blonde wood wardrobes, and simple furnishings. These tend to be larger and in the main body of the hotel. In the Buckingham Wing, rooms are smaller, chintzier and the bathrooms a bit more tired. Which type you prefer will depend on you, but I would advise that you request not to be put in the Buckingham Wing."
154,617,"Oct 25 2006 	Beautiful hotel - great location	The Thistle Charing Cross is a lovely hotel, situated atop the Charing Cross train station. It's close to Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square, Parliament and everything else you want to be near in London. The Hop-on-Hop-iff Sightseeing bus is also right there in the parking lot.The staff is friendly, and the rooms are nice, neat and clean! We ate most of our breakfasts/lunches in the nearby restaurants - McDonald's Subway and more are right outside the door. Dinner was usually at a local pub, of which there are many!Not too flashy, but a great hotel for the price. And I totally recommend checking online deals -- because we got our room for 80-100 less online than they charge on site or on their own website."
155,617,"Oct 23 2006	Great location	We have just returned from 2 nights at the Thistle Charing Cross where we stayed while celebrating a birthday weekend. There were six of us in our party and we chose the hotel for its central location. We all live just a train ride from London so most of us had never stayed overnight in town before.The best thing about the hotel is definitely its position. Many of the activities we had organised were just a few minutes walk away, such as tea at the Savoy, dinner at Simpsons-in-the-Strand and the theatre at Covent Garden. We only needed to use public transport once, when we visited Harrods one morning. The rooms were modern and very clean but our's was extremely small, even by London standards. The fact that our bathroom was very large made this situation more odd! However, the other rooms occupied by our party were bigger with slightly smaller bathrooms. Our rooms were all next to eachother on the second floor, near the beautiful sweeping staircase. I was worried that this would mean a lot of noise but I didn't hear any late at night. There was some noise from Villiers Street below our window but not enough to keep us awake.A major downside to our room was the revolting smell of cooking oil from time to time. We must have been near to an extract vent for the kitchen because it was very strong. Also, our kettle didn't work and the staff were not very helpful or sympathetic when we asked for a replacement. When I phoned downstairs, I was put through to an extension that just rang continuously so I had to keep phoning reception before someone finally dealt with the problem.The breakfast was good but only worth it if it's included in the price of your stay, as in our case. The food was hot and plentiful but the staff were not exactly welcoming. The minibar was extremely expensive - 1.75 for a Mars Bar! - so stock up on snacks and drinks at the convenience store just up the road so you won't get tempted!All in all, I would stay here again for the location but I would ask to see (and smell) the room before accepting it!"
156,617,"Oct 23 2006 	The place to stay in London	My husband and I stayed here for 10/13 through 10/15/2006. The location of this hotel is amazing, right at Charing Cross tube stop and near Embankment. We walked to Covent Garden from this location. The room was clean and lovely. It had the amenities we require, including room safe, and some that were just nice extras, like a heated towel rack.The staff was very friendly. We did ask the desk for a non-smoking room on a top floor, were told we were being given one, and then were placed in a smoking room on a lower floor. However, as we were on a very tight schedule we did not go back to the desk to ask again for a non-smoking high floor , so we didn't give them a chance to make it right, but I do note the error. As noted in previous reviews, rooms near street level suffer from early morning garbage truck noise.We were asked if we wanted a room in the old part of the hotel or the new part. When I stay again I will ask for a room in the same building as the lobby. Getting to the attached building required travelling a complicated route which included two elevators.The internet connection in our room did not work. The staff tried to troubleshoot it, but it was a bigger problem than replacing the modem could fix. We didn't ask to move to another room, again due to a tight schedule, so I don't know if the hotel would have been able to fix this. If we had planned to stay longer this would have been a much more serious problem.Despite the glitches I loved the hotel's location and comfort and plan to make this my home base whenever I'm in London."
157,617,"Oct 17 2006	Location Location Location	Just returned home from a stay at the Thistle Charing Cross with my husband. Had a fantastic time!! We love London anyway and make quite regular visits but we both agreed this is the best visit so far, mainly due to the location of this hotel. Right in the heart of all the places we like to spend out time...Piccadilly, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, etc etc etc. Not to forget the hotel itself....it is clean, comfortable and any requests were dealt with immediately....we found the staff to be very helpful! Breakfast was ample. Will definitely be staying here again!"
158,617,"Oct 8 2006 	Very good hotel	I stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross for two nights in early October, 2006. This was my third trip to London.This is a good hotel. The staff weren't overly friendly, but they weren't rude either.The restaurant was good, and the breakfast buffet, though pricey, was very good.The room size was large for a European hotel. The pillows and linens were higher quality than I've found for similar hotels in the EU.The bathroom was small, but it had a full tub/shower. It was acceptable.The location is great. You are right on top of the Charing Cross tube station, adjacent to Covent Garden (a large area of restaurants, shops, theaters, and nightlife), and right around the corner from Trafalgar Square. It is within walking distance of Parliament and Buckingham Palace. There is a pharmacy (Boots), and a small boutique grocer next door. You really can't beat the location.The room was clean, but is in desparate need of an update. The walpaper was shredded on the corners from where people had rubbed it with their luggage. Otherwise it was very good.The hotel is very pricey, but with the exchange rate as high as it is, that is to be expected.One more thing about traveling to London... take an umbrella. It will be raining."
159,617,"Oct 2 2006 	Excellent Location	Stayed for five nights at the end of September 2006 and booked through Londontown.comRoom was a &quot;deluxe double&quot; with one double bed. Room was good sized with a sitting area and bathroom had a marble vanity and a tub/shower combo with a full shower curtain and excellent water pressure. Room was in the Buckingham wing and very quiet. No disturbances from the railroad station since this wing is not over the station but directly next door.Staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall good housekeeping and the room was in excellent repair. Excellent air conditioning system!Breakfast buffet which was included in the rate was extensive and included juices, cereals, fried and scrambled eggs, toast, sausages, bacon, mushrooms, baked beans..the usual &quot;full English&quot; fare. Breakfast room is large and the service was very good. Free newspapers offered. The hotel has a &quot;business center&quot; (4 Pounds for 20 minutes) if you don't wish to use the in-room internet connections.The location, as has been noted, is excellent and within very easy walking distance of Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, Leicester Square, as well as the Thames. The Charing Cross Tube stop is adjacent and the Embankment Tube stop a very short walk down Villiers Street. Lots of restaurants (several Italian places), MacDonalds, Pret-A-Manger, Marks &amp; Spencer food, snack stores, take-outs, and three-four coffee shops including Costa and Starbucks are close by. EasyInternet is just down the street.We had a minor problem with the room rate which differed from that guaranteed by Londontown but that was very cheerfully and immediately rectified by the front desk staff when I pointed that out.I would not hesitate to stay again. For London it offers great value for money."
160,617,"Oct 1 2006 	Brilliant Location	We stayed there at the beginning of september and booked a Junior Suite. The hotel was lovely, the staff very friendly but even better was the location. You are literally bang smack in the middle of London. 2 mins walk from Trafalgar Square. Plenty of pubs and restaurants on the street next to the hotel. Find Gordons wine bar defo worth a visit. No noise surprisingly and it's right next to the metro. Fabulous."
161,617,"Sep 24 2006 	Good Choice	This hotel is worth it just for the location. I would definitely stay here again. It is within walking distance of sereval attractions and 2 different tube stations. There is also a pharmacy, a small grocery store, and several restaurants very close to the hotel.The rooms were very clean, neat and modern. They have a full bath and are pretty spacious.The breakfast was included in our room rate, but if its not included in your rate, its really not worth the cost.The staff were very friendly, but not very helpfull. I had some trouble checking out because I booked through an agency and i knew I was supposed to pay for the room myself, but I was unable to convince them. I decided to take care of it after i returned to the States."
162,617,"Sep 20 2006 	Great location	The Thistle Charing Cross could hardly be more convenient for visitors who want to see the top attractions in London. Our room was clean and well decorated. The bed was comfortable yet we would have preferred a queen, king or twins instead of a double. We asked and they said they had only doubles.Overall, we liked the hotel can would probably return but there were two problems. (1) We made four local telephone calls (all to numbers in London, but some distance from the hotel) and they charged $8-$10 dollars per call. We only talked 2-3 minutes per call. I thought the charge was highway robbery and I told them as much. No matter, they would not lowered or waive the charge. (2) The concierge was not very competent. We asked for assistance in printing our boarding passes before departure and he had no idea what we wanted. We printed them at an Internet Cafe nearby. Later, the pleasant and attractive lady at reception told us we should have asked her. She could do it for us easily."
163,617,"Sep 12 2006 	Priceline booking !!!! Great great location historical property	We loved the location. Right on the tube line, across from Trafalgar square. Walking distance to everything. 10 min the leichster square, Buckingham, Picadilly Circus, Regent St, The Eye, 15 mins to Hyde park, Harrods, Diana Memorial, Oxford St, Wesminister Abby, parliment, Churchill war rooms etc etc. So much to see and do. We enjoyed the Marks and Spencer food store in the lobby for quick fresh snacks. There is a Mcd's beside and a Starbucks across the street. The rooms was huge with a king size bed and a huge bathroom. The staff and concierge were more than willing to assist. The Sherlock Holmes pub is right down the lane and worth a visit...a real english pub. We would recommend this hotel and thought the $125/nt mid August excellent value."
164,617,"Sep 9 2006 	Location is unbeatable	If you're in town for a couple of days and want to be in the heart of many of the big sights, and don't want to shell out a small fortune to do it, you should consider this hotel.The hotel sits atop the Charing Cross station, yards from Trafalgar Square, and within walking distance to nearly everyting. Have a little time to kill before dinner? Just pop over to the (free) National Gallery and peek at some of the masterpieces--it's practically right next door! My wife and I enjoy walking everywhere and so were not bothered by the distance to the Tower of London (~2.5 miles), British Museum (~3/4 mile), or Buckingham Palace (~3/4 mile). Not into walking? The tube is right under your feet or take one of the several busses that stop right in front of the hotel. Take the train from Embankment to Kew for a day--you won't regret it.The rooms are plenty large and comfortable. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking Villiers Street and could just barely hear the revelers on a busy (and late) Saturday night--but nothing that kept us awake. Despite being atop a rail station, it is remarkably quiet. I'm a light sleeper and could just hear the low rumble of a train from time to time, which I rather liked, actually.Hotel staff was courteous and attentive. Our flight arrived before the usual check-in time but did not have any problems checking in early. The return flight left well after check-out, but the concierge held our bags for us (in a secure location) while we got in some last minute sightseeing.The location of this hotel cannot be overstated. There are so many restaraunts and theatres and conveniences nearby, plus the Tube, not to mention Embankment Pier which provides ferry access along the Thames.The hotel is easy to find. In Google Earth or Google Maps type 51 30'30&quot;N, 0 7'29&quot;W"
165,617,"Sep 6 2006 	Location is everything - never even took a bus!	Did copious research prior to selecting a hotel in London. Had initially booked at the Trafalgar Square property (looks like a public housing project and is not as up to date) and then moved over. Shop around if you want to stay here as Orbitz offers better pricing including the huge British buffet breakfast, vs. Expedia that charges more and does not include breakfast. Room 627 (sixth floor is non-smoking and it seemed that guests honored this restriction) was on top floor so it minimized noise from adjacent train station, was roomy by British standards, and had all modern conveniences. We wanted to use the fridge for snacks so hotel staff happily cleaned out the minibar so we could do so. Also, it was still hot outside so the AC was great! The heavy duvets were removed and housekeeping switched to sheets and blankets instead which was a cooler option. Feather pillows were promptly delivered after we asked the housekeeper to take the foam rubber slabs away. The location of this hotel cannot be beat - we walked every day to sightsee, eat out, etc. and only took two short taxi rides late at night on way home from dinners/barhopping so never had to buy tube/bus passes. 24 hour Tesco Metro mini-supermarkets were within three blocks, plus many restaurants that offer take out- Exotica on Villiers street, 50 feet from hotel's front door had very good international food at good prices. After 5 nights here, we had only put a small dent in our sightseeing and shopping wish list, plus got to see the final leg of the Tour de Britain bike race and two free concerts at Trafalgar Square. We will be back, as it pays to stay centrally located and walk vs. being tied to tube and bus schedules and associated expense!Buy a used copy of Time Out's Cheap Eats or download their top picks for Central London for free - we hit four of their recommended spots and were very happy with these meals. Also, visit toptables for dining offers. Skip the rip off Starbucks chain locations and go with the local coffee cafes for better value. Stroll east toward the Savoy hotel and visit the Coal Hole pub - where Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and other performers used to hang out in between shows at the Savoy Theatre. About 10 minutes walk inthe other direction is the Sherlock Holmes pub, complete with recreated room from the books/movies. Take the Original London tour bus for orientation around the city that departs adjacent to Trafalgar Square- a four minute stroll from the hotel, and then partake of the Choices option for 3 pound fish &amp; chips lunch..ok food at the Sherlock Holmes, with a few tables out on sidewalk.What's not to like about the Thisle Charring Cross? Slamming doors! Every morning we awoke to a chorus of slamming doors. It would be hard to sleep after 8:00Am due to the noise. If sensitive, get a room away from maid's closets, service elevators, and the elevators which &quot;talk&quot; as doors open and close on each floor - maddening! On the positive side, if you leave the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; light indicator on, they won't bother you (just the slamming of adjacent doors will) but your room will not be serviced.If you need a taxi on Saturday or Sunday, book in advance as they are not as plentiful at the taxi stand next door at the station. Note that there is no &quot;Down&quot; escalator at Charring Cross tube station, only an &quot;Up&quot; escalator, and tube station and airport escalators and elevators are notoriously unreliable. Taxi fare from Paddington to hotel was 11 pounds, 12 pounds to return to Paddington on trip home. Had to haul my suitcase up two flights of stairs from Heathrow express train station rather than wait for 20 minutes to get into the only functioning elevator (two were out of service..what else is new?) When asking about restaurants with Concierge, be clear about your budget. They sent us to a lovely and very pricey spot - Axis at the One Aldwich Hotel. Snooty staff, and high prices to match. We would have been happier in the other more casual spot inside the same hotel for dinner. If you like quieter bar/lounge settings for drinks, do go here and enjoy the relative calm in another wise party-central neighborhood, especially on weekends. If the hotel staff books you a meal reservation, ask for details on the spot as the staff members tend to change shifts and not share the information with the next crew, leaving everyone to sort out/do detective work to find out where your next meal is booked."
166,617,"Sep 3 2006 	Wonderful stay	This is a wonderful hotel in a great area of the city. My room was large, well decorated, clean and comfortable. The tube stop is right outside and busses to almost everywhere are right out front. It is an easy walk to theatres, Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus. Anything that you might need is very close by. I highly recommend this hotel."
167,617,"Aug 28 2006 	Good place - VERY central	This Hotel is a very centrally located and is on a bus and a few subway (&quot;the tube&quot;) routes. (oh --and Starbucks is right across the street)Once I got there I paid an extra 34 pounds to upgrade to the suite. It was a very nice room indeed. Breakfast was greatService was greatVery clear and modern roomsFree Internet in the lounge, but something ridiculous like 40 pounds a day for in room internet (that's my only negative).Anyway....for 100 - 134 pounds a night is VERY well worth it in London !!! (ps - call &quot;londontown for the best rates&quot;. )"
168,617,"Aug 24 2006	Location! Location! Location!	This is a charming hotel in the perfect location. It's located above &quot;the Tube&quot;. You can't get any better than that. The subway entrance is literally like 15 feet from the entrance! How awesome is that! And it's about 1.5 blocks from Trafalgar Square, 3 blocks from Westminister Abbey, and walking distance to most other attractions. We did have to use 2 different elevators but it was not a problem. We asked for a non-smoknig room but there were none available the day that we checked in. But they promptly moved our stuff the next day and it was ready when we returned from our excersion into the city. It is also very close to the theaters. We watched a musical and were able to walk there. The room was very clean. The furniture was nice and modern. I had a very pleasant experience there and would recommend it to anyone!"
169,617,"Aug 22 2006 	Fabulous Value	I paid GBP 119 per night inclusive of VAT and breakfast. This represented tremendous value for money and was GBP 70 per night cheaper than the hotel I had originally booked. We arrived very early at the hotel (7am) but were able to check in immediately. The check in was flawless and the receptionist was very friendly and attentive. When we arrived in the room there was a bottle of champagne which we had not ordered. Before risking a huge bill, we checked with the front desk who informed us it was left from the night before when the guests did not turn up. We were welcome to keep it with their compliments. Say no more :)The room was small, but very clean. We had a view out of the front of Charing Cross via a small side window. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was modern and clean. The location of this hotel is ideal for any visitor to London. Charing Cross is served by main line as well as two underground lines directly at the hotel, whilst Embankment station is a short walk away.From the hotel we could easily walk to Covent Garden, Whitehall, Westminster, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Leicester Square and Picadilly Circus. Breakfast was in a beautiful old Victorian room. Food was pretty average and the waiters could not cope with a sudden rush due to a large tourist group, but for the price, you can harldy complain.I notice that the Thistle chain regularly have special offers and I would strongly recommed to check their website. This hotel as well as the one at Horse Guards Parade seem to gain the best reviews.Another tip for all tourists to London, check out the London Pass at www.londonpass.com. This represents outstanding value for money. We saved a lot of $$$ with this card and managed to visit a lot of places we probably would not have gone if we hadn't had the card. Well worth it.London is a fab city and the Thistle Charing Cross is a perfect location to experience it from."
170,617,"Aug 19 2006	Good location large room disappointing service	The hotel is very conveniently located, and my (executive) room was surprisingly large and well appointed for a mid-range London hotel.The lift was not working, which the front desk did NOT tell me at check in when they asked if I needed help with my bags. It remained out of order for the 3 days I was there.I did not choose &quot;breakfast included&quot; in my reservation, but when I checked in I was told that it was included anyway. When I went down to breakfast the next morning I was told it was NOT included. When I went my room to get my luggage and check out, it was 5 minutes after check-out time, and my key had stopped working. They had literally turned it off, though I had not checked out. Since I could not find a house phone, I had to walk down two flights of stairs and across two lobbies to get to the front desk and get a new key, in order to go UP two flights of stairs to get my luggage, which I then carried DOWN the same stairs again.Although the hotel is in an area with very busy traffic, my room in the back looked out on Buckingham Street, which is both quiet and charming.Overall I'd stay there again, for the room size and the location. If you go, just be aware that service standards are not the same as US standards and adjust your expectations accordingly."
171,617,"Aug 2 2006 	Unbeatable on Location	We spent some time researching hotels in London around the 100 a night mark and finally settled on the Thistle Charing Cross. We had already visited London for a long weekend earlier in year and stayed in Kensington so we had were keen to compare the locations. The hotel is the old railway hotel for Charing Cross station. Walking out of the front door the station and underground station is immediately on your left. A two minute walk west is Trafalgar Square, just south of that is the statue of King Charles which marks the centre of London and the point where all distances are measured. Within 5 minutes walk from the hotel is Leicester square, Covent Garden and Embankment. About 10  15 minutes walk will see you at Westminster Abby and Buckingham Palace. Fantastic if you want to save money and not buy a Travelcard.Checking into the hotel was straight forward and the staff were very friendly. The main staircase is very impressive, with a nice seating area at the bottom. We were on the 4th floor; the room was very clean and looked like it had recently been revamped. It even had a plug socket for American appliances (110V). The only criticism for the room was the size. It had obviously been a reasonably sized room when it was built but once the fitted wardrobes and en suite had been added the room lost about half its size. It was fine for the two of use though for three nights but anything longer than a week would get a bit uncomfortable.All in all the hotel was very reasonably priced, well appointed and has a fantastic location. I would highly recommend."
172,617,"Jul 28 2006 	Fantastic central location. Close to everything!	Great location, clean and staff is very helpful. My Mom and I stayed there last year. Our room was not available so we got an upgrade for the night. Lavazza cappucino/espresso maker was nice . Penhaligon's shampoo, etc. is a nice plus. Bathrooms were spacious and clean. Bed was very comfy.Had afternoon tea at the hotel too. Very good and cheaper than most places. Plus, a great view. We got to look out at St. Martin-in-the-Field's. We were in the newer Art Deco type rooms. Very nice. You will hear some of the trains going out/in since Charing Cross Station is right next to the hotel. For me, a nice sound.Location is fantastic. Right on the Strand. Trafalgar Square, National Gallery, National Portrait Gallery all right there. Boots is right next door. Covent Garden is about a 5 minute walk. Pret a Manger close by too.Embankment tube station is a couple minute walk and Charing Cross Station is right there. Lastly, take Villers St. to the Embankment to see the little Victoria Embankment Gardens. Great little cafe where you can eat a cheap, but tasty English breakfast for under L4 and sit looking at the Thames."
173,617,"Jul 12 2006	The Perfect Place to Call Home in London	I've visited London nearly every year and usually stay at the nearby Royal Adelphi Hotel on Villiers Street, just around the corner from the Thistle Charing Cross Hotel. Because my usual place was filled to capacity, I found myself staying here instead. What a blessing! First of all, as a regular visitor to London, it's my opinion that this area is the best place to stay as it's so easily accessible to everything else in the city either by walking or by tube. There are four separate underground lines within one block of this hotel. Our room was wonderful and the breakfast buffet was unbelieveably fantastic. Everything was clean and the staff was most helpful. We took a one-day trip away to Paris and they held our luggage for us and then gave us a room upgrade upon our return. Not sure why, but it was a welcome surprise. I felt no discrimination because of being a &quot;discount&quot; customer. The Coffea coffee shop around the corner has awesome jacket potatoes on their menu and there's a health-food grocery also alongside the hotel. They accomodated our request for vegetarian food and couldn't have been more pleasant about it. There are so many kinds of ethnic restaurants on Villiers Street just adjacent to the hotel. From now on, I'll be calling the Thistle Charing Cross Hotel my home away from home whenever I'm in London. I only wish I could visit more often."
174,617,"Jul 11 2006	We loved the Thistle Charing Cross!	After two prior stays at the Thistle Euston, and one stay at the Thistle Marble Arch, we had all but decided that the Thistle chain did not meet our needs or expectations for a comfortable stay in London. Thistle Charing Cross has changed our minds about that!Fantastic location, nice, comfortable AIR CONDITIONED rooms, pleasant staff...we had all our expectaions met, if not exceeded in this hotel. Transportation links could not be easier to reach from the hotel, lots of interesting sights within walking distance, many food choices, too. The room does have one of those crazy 'automatic' mini bars, so if you jostle anything, it will be added to your bill. That was the only downside to the room...it was HOT, the minbar prices were ridiculous, and we would have liked to store water bottles in the fridge. This was a minor inconvenience, thank goodness.We had a wonderful stay the the Thistle Charing Cross, and hope to visit again soon!"
175,617,"Jul 7 2006 	This is the place to stay	Stayed here for business/pleasure trip for a week and could not ask for a better place at a t better price. The location was perfect with no less than three tube stops within a short walk. Lots of great places to eat nearby and even a Starbucks across the street for those who cant get by without one.Located at the physical center of London, youre within walking distance of lots of great spots including the National Gallery, Piccadilly and Trafalgar square (just to name a few). The street was busy, but didnt find it as noisy some described. The staff were exceedingly helpful and took great pains to recommend restaurants and provide directions. The room was big (for London) with a nice modern feel with somewhat limited storage space. It has a standard mini fridge with a little leftover space for storage, but dont move anything or youll be charged. The only downside was the queen bed was made of two twins with a split down the center- not exactly what we're use to.The pub on premises was very nice with friendly staff. It was the only place to have a nightcap after many of the pubs closed at 11P. Pricing was standard on drinks. Would stay there again in a heartbeat. What a great place."
176,617,"Jun 23 2006	Highly Recommend the Thistle Charing Cross	My friend and I stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross in early June and had a great experience. It was our first trip to London and found the location very convenient. We were close to much and for things we weren't within walking distance to there were 2 Underground stations right there (Charing Cross and Embankment). We had a room with 2 twin beds with a sitting area and it was nice size (normal US hotel room size). The bathroom was large and the water pressure was fantastic. The rooms have a hair dryer and AC. AC was very important. It wasn't hot outside but once you're trying to sleep in your room you'll appreciate it. There is also a 24-hour lounge/bar area for residents which was nice since the pubs close so early. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, even with dumb questions like how to dial the US. They also gave a great sushi restaurant recommendation. We also never heard or felt the trains even though the hotel is right above a stop and right at a national rail stop. I'd stay here again if I made it back to London."
177,617,Jun 5 2006	Great Hotel for a great price!	My husband and I stayed here from May 24-28 with a super deal from Priceline. When we checked in at the desk we were offered an upgrade for 35 pounds for a junior suite. I asked if they could include breakfast for that and it was no problem. Well the breakfast alone was 16 pounds per person so why not upgrade.  Steven at the reception desk was wonderful and extremely helpful. He is definately an asset to that hotel. Anything that he could help you with wasn't a problem. I really liked having the room upgrade just for the space. We had room 322 and had a view of the Strand. Big comfy king bed with a duvet and lots of pillows. Nice clean room with a nice sized bathroom. Would I stay here again? In a heartbeat. The location and price couldn't be beat. Lots of little shops and places to pick up food. We had them clear out the minibar so we could put our own stuff in. No problem at all.
178,617,Jun 2 2006	Great Service Excellent Location Awsome Rooms	Stayed at this Hotel for 5 days and arrived very early before check in. They allowed us to check in early and was upgraded for free! had an excellent room and great view. The service was excellent and always reliable. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was always looked after at all times of the day. The room was really clean and nice. This is a safe bet.
179,617,"Jun 1 2006	For its type excellent.	There are already quite a few reviews for this hotel, and I found most appraisals to be quite accurate. I stayed here for five nights. As someone who travels often to London and is quite familiar with the hotel situation there, I was extremely pleased with the Thistle Charing Cross.From Victoria station (where the Gatwick Express stops), a taxi will run you about 9 (including tip). If youre traveling light, the tube is a viable option for you  also a quicker one on a weekday. Victoria to Embankment is three stops; from there, its a hundred yards (uphill) to the hotel.Nearly every review mentions how good the location is, and I absolutely agree. There are plenty of moderate and upscale restaurants, bars, shops and banks nearby, as well as a convenience store and a McDonalds, both notable because theyre open very late. Charing Cross tube station, which serves two convenient lines (Bakerloo, Northern), is literally next door.The hotels public areas are nicely decorated and well-maintained. This applies to the rooms as well. Mine was in the new wing (as opposed to the Buckingham wing) and was modern and average-sized for Europe.I did have three complaints. The heated towel rack in my bathroom did not work (yet somehow I survived). Because Charing Cross train station neighbors the hotel, you can feel the trains arriving and departing: its a presence but not a nuisance. Louder and irritating are the doors slamming in the hallways, a problem because the front door provides little sound insulation. This is especially prevalent mid-morning when the rooms are being made up. Its unpleasant and difficult to sleep through.My conclusion: Without question, this hotel deserves a higher ranking than #141. Of course you could find a more luxurious (and more expensive) hotel in London, but for its type, the Thistle Charing Cross deserves five stars . . . less one for the slamming doors."
180,617,"May 31 2006	A Tale of Two Hotels -- part II	Just returned from a wonderful, 8-night visit to London. My husband and I were traveling with his parents and this trip was his mothers first to Europe, so a special occasion indeed. Not being as savvy a traveler as ourselves, we decided to handle hotel reservations -- we are familiar with just how expensive hotels can be in London and wanted to make sure we had comfortable and convenient accommodations. Weve used Priceline during past visits to London and knew we could get a great place for a fraction of the cost. We had to split our stay because Priceline didnt seem to have inventory for 8 straight nights for 2 rooms. For the first three nights, we stayed at the Millennium London Mayfair (please see review for this hotel), and for the remaining 5 nights, we stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross. We were thrilled to get this hotel, having stayed there during our last trip to London in May 05.Upon arrival (at around noon) we were told that our rooms would not be ready until 2pm. The front desk clerk was a little surly, but that may have been because they were arranging accommodations for an enormous tour group that had just arrived. For whatever reason, the hotel only had record of one hotel reservation. I had a copy/confirmation from Priceline and after some checking and shuffling; he told me he was able to find a room (not sure what happened there  thats never occurred in the many, many times weve used priceline). The parents wanted to know if they could switch from their deluxe double room to a room with single beds, we were told (by the not-so-nice clerk) that it would cost an additional 35GBP -- obviously we declined. We then checked our bags with the front desk and ventured out. When we returned at around 2:30, the front desk clerk who greeted us was far friendlier that the one previously mentioned. She said our rooms were available and just a few doors down from one another. Since the parents were still out sightseeing, we took the liberty of surveying the rooms and getting the bags upstairs. Both rooms on the 6th floor were spacious with a queen bed, an equally spacious bathroom and were very clean, nicely furnished with no real visible wear or tear at all. One room had two windows, the other just one  but had a little larger sitting area under the window and a fantastic view of the Thames! Overall, I give this hotel a 9.5 out of 10. The lobby is smaller than the Millennium, but tastefully decorated. The staff is friendly and prompt. The bed and room was very clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated -- the bathrooms modern and roomy. The hotel location simply cannot be beat!! Right on top of Charing Cross tube/rail station with dozens of sights, and restaurants just steps away, the Thistle is superbly positioned. The bar is open 24 hours  my husband and I along with friend who lives in London were even able to grab a late night drink in the wee hours of the night (or morning!). There are dozens of little sandwich shops in the alleyway next to the hotel (Villers Street) where you can grab a quick breakfast or lunch for 2 for under 10GBP. Covent Garden, Leicester Square, the National Gallery are within a 10 minute walk or less. This hotel is a REAL bargain if you are able to obtain a room via priceline. I apologize for the length of this review, but wanted to be as thorough as possible. For PART I of my London hotel review, please see my post under the Millennium Mayfair for information on how these two properties compare."
181,617,"May 16 2006	Very nice hotel - even excellent	My wife and I just spent 2 wonderful nights here. I stayed here nearly 10 years ago as they were making renovations and had forgotten how surprisingly opulent the interior is. I agree with the other positive reviews re. rooms, location, etc. I want to add that the 2nd floor dining rooms and lounge has the look of a 5 star hotel - gorgeously high ceilings, classic paintings, and that grand staircase. Great hotel in the heart of it all."
182,617,"May 15 2006	Excellent Position! ~ Odd Dodgy Room	This hotel is situated just a short walk up from the Embanment tube station and right next door to Charing Cross rail station. Just outside you have got Theatreland, Trafalgar Square, National &amp; Portrait Galleries all around you ~ Superb Location. Traditional old railway hotel, nicely renovated and modernised, with quite a plush feel as soon as you enter the smallish reception area, through revolving door. A polite and friendly staff greeting. Along tall regal corridors to a grand sweeping staircase and lifts to all floors. We had booked two rooms. Ours was quite small and very hot (air conditioning seemed to have been on the blink) clean, modern and very comfortable. Good size bathroom, clean and efficient (although our hand basin was cracked). On the other hand our daughter's room, further along the corridor was double the size, clean and modern like ours, but with a perfectly working air-con system - no complaints at all. (We were only staying the one night and were too short of time to complain about our faulty air-con, but on another occasion we would have asked to be moved). We had a few drinks in the upstairs bar late'ish on Saturday night, again a quietish plush ambiance, windows looking towards direction of Trafalgar Square, efficient service ~ but VERY EXPENSIVE drinks. Straight into breakfast on Sunday morning, excellent all-round English Breakfast (unfortunately Pain Chocolat were hard as nails). Many of the hotel staff appeared to be either Russian or Slavic ~ very polite, and friendly in an understated way. If you get a good rate, I would certainly recommend this hotel (ask to have a look at the room first!) ~ I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL FOR ITS LOCATION ALONE."
183,617,"May 14 2006	Great location	We stayted at the Thistle Charing Cross for 9 nights and the location can't be beat.It's only 5 minute walk to the Trafalgar Square and about 10 minutes to the Covent Garden.The tube station is right outside the hotel which made it very convenient. There are two Starbucks, japanese, italian and all kind of other foods and convenience stores just around the corner.Staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was kind of small (which was expected), but was clean and comfortable.Breakfast was ok, definitely not worth 16.50 pounds which comes up to about $30 per person. Our hotel rate included breakfast, but expect to pay about $30 per person if not included.We will definitely stay there again"
184,617,"May 10 2006	Central Location and a nice room	Very nice hotel. Lots of history and it has undergone extensive renovations. Clean and spacious rooms. Shower and Bath in washroom with lots of room to move around. There were no clothes hooks in the washroom,very strange - so we had to use the door knob. No biggie.It's a large hotel so it can be a bit of a walk to elevator (or LIFT as it is referred to in England) to and from your room..Again, it was not an issue to us. The breakfast was good. It was the usual - Back Bacon, Sausages, Friters, Grilled Tomatoes, and eggs done over-easy.They also had tons of cereals and an assortment of canned and fresh fruit.Try to get there for around 8:30 - otherwise, it gets busy and you might have to wait a while to be seated. The hotel staff were polite and dilligent. The hotel is right in the heart of London. So Covent Gardens, SOHO, Lechester Sq.,Trafelgar Sq., the EYE, Westminster Abbey, etc. are all within 10-15 min walk. You got to take the underground if you want to see Buckingham Palace.All in all we would stay here again. Enjoy."
185,617,"May 4 2006	Right in the centre of town	A fantastic hotel! Right in the centre of town. Staff were excellent and the accommodation was great. Just a few problems, one was that the lifts werent working on the Saturday and after walking around London all day (I dont do the tube!) having to walk up 6 flights of stairs wasnt amusing. There was a gentle man on out floor that uses a wheel chair, at least I could walk down and he was stuck. Took them several hours to repair them. The second was the fruit as breakfast was rotten I went to pick an apple up and the whole thing oozed between my fingers  I was totally put off eating anything else.Apart from that the hotel is a great place to stay."
186,617,"May 1 2006	Great location	The best thing about the hotel is the convenient location. The secod best thing was the deal we got on Priceline. To be able to stay within walking distance of so many places, and with the trains and tube literally steps away, is wonderful! The hotel itself is adequate. The room was ok, the bathroom was very nice, and the staff was fairly helpful. Be sure to try to stay on a lower floor, as it appears that many priceline people get bumped to rooms very far away from the elevators! Frankly, we stayed a lot further away for a more expensive room our last trip, so we were thrilled with the price and location. Would definitely stay here again."
187,617,"Apr 27 2006	Surprisingly Quiet	I stayed at the Charing Cross last week and was surprised to find out how nice it was bearing in mind that it was above a train station. The room was quiet (you could not hear any trains) and the location was terrific being just down the road from Covent Garden, Trafalgar Square and the Courtauld Institute. The room was nice and the staff were friendly."
188,617,"Apr 14 2006	Great Value Amazing Location	We got a luxurious and spacious room by US, and for sure by UK standards on the 5th floor overlooking The Strand for $150 per night on Priceline. This is a lovely grand, old, well maintained hotel in a prime location, next to Trafalgar Square, 10 mins walking to Covent Garden."
189,617,"Apr 5 2006 	Absolutely Lovely!!	This hotel went beyond our expectations. Upon arriving at the hotel at 10:00a.m. from Canada, we were told our room was not ready. We didn't expect it to be. We were able to leave our luggage in a secured room by the front dest. We went site seeing for a couple of hours but by 1:00p.m. we were feeling really tired and wanted to get into our room. We walked back to the hotel and our room was ready. Check-in was really quick and efficient. Our room was on the sixth floor. The elevators were really quick. We didn't have much of a view but that was ok. We were over the Charing Cross train station but never heard the trains. Big Ben clock tower was just in our view and every now and again we could hear the bells chime. We did ask for the newer section. The room was lovely. Lots of closet space. Nice big washroom. We had a writing desk/chair and a dresser and a queen bed with two night stands and one armchair. There was a mini bar well stocked but we never used it. The tea/coffee service was used everyday though. It was very clean. Nice big pillows with extra pillows in the closet. We used the safe and the iron/board, also in the closet. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. The full english breakfast was included with our room. It was fantastic. We stayed for seven days and not once did we have to wait in line for breakfast. There were plenty of staff getting us tea/coffee and toast. The food was hot and there was lots of variety. It was in a beautiful old room. The doorman was especially friendly and helpful. He even recommended a great Italian restaurant to us. We had paid in advance so when we needed to check out at 5 a.m we had no problem. A taxi was called for us by the staff upon leaving. The location was great. We only used the tube to get from Paddinton Station to Charing Cross the first day. The rest of the time we were able to walk to everything. I would definitly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again!"
190,617,"Mar 30 2006	Great Hotel Fantastic Location	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights from Wed-Sat, we had originally booked the Royal Horseguards but they had over booked so we were moved down the road to the Charing Cross, we had full breakfast included (instead of continental at the Horseguards) and they upgraded our room to a Junior Suite. The room was lovely, we were a bit early checking in so we were given complimentary drinks and updated regularly, we only got about half way through our drinks and our room was ready for us!! Everything was well cleaned, the bed was comfy, there was plenty of room to hang things up and we had a comfy sofa which we later realised was a sofa bed! The only thing I would say is that we didn't have any sort of view, however once you step out of the hotel Trafalgar Square was only about 100m away, which meant we were close to everything, literally minutes away from London Eye, Westminster, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, the Thames, Piccadilly Circus, the Mall etc etc). In the four days we were in London we only used the tube once!Breakfast in the hotel was fantastic, all the full English food was kept hot and was replenished quickly, it all was really tasty and they gave you warm plates so it didn't go cold. All the other things available looked lovely and were well displayed but I'm partial to my full English! The staff were all very helpful, getting our Tea/Coffee &amp; toast quickly and there were no queues. It was busier on Sat morning but there was no waiting around. Also the room where breakfast was held was fantastically old and beautiful with lovely high ceilings and fantastic features.We were in room 315, which was close to the stairs but not noisy at all and you couldn't hear the trains below at all. All in all we had a fantastic stay and at a great price, we booked through Hotel Connect and we paid upfront so when we came to check out of the hotel there was nothing to pay-which was nice as we had spent the last 4 days having food, going out, seeing the sights, and generally spending money!"
191,617,"Mar 29 2006	Ok'ish	Stayed at the Thistle on the 29th March, the plus points are location, staff try hard, I was upgraded to a junior suite which was excellent. Nice modern room, huge bathroom, real nice bed..The downside was breakfast, which is served in a truly arwful room, which had about 15 people queing up for breakfast at 7-30.Bottom line is if you like old fashioned hotels with charm, then this is for you, if you are into modern hotels then for the same price go to the City Inn Westminster..."
192,617,"Mar 24 2006	wildly lukewarm	Don't expect a gushing welcome here - the receptionist we got was brusque to the point of rudeness, Try to avoid the rooms in the annexe, reached via a very chilly bridge from the main building - showerhead fell off and pedal-bin broken. Frankly there is a pronounced interest in you here as a credit-card holder to be debited, but not much as a guest to be looked after - a queue of at least 25 people for breakfast at 09.30 on Sunday morning. A pity, as the location is good, public rooms well maintained and senior staff do try. In our opinion there's better elsewhere in the area...."
193,617,Mar 20 2006	No Complaints	We had a pleasant stay with our room being on the 5th floor. No queues checking in with polite staff. No noise either from the nearby lift or outside and had view of the Thames. Lovely breakfast and a no hassle checking out.All in all the hotel is in a great location with a reasonable room rate.
194,617,Mar 17 2006	Convenient location but THAT is it!!	A shiney dump. I have not got to much good to say about this hotel. I just did not like being there so i am going to serve up this small dish of complaint!!!! Basically the vibe of this joint is downcast and overwhelmingly uninviting ....i got my first sense of that when i saw that it was located over an underground train entrance. And about the elevators!! This may be old news to anyone who has stayed there before BUT it is my turn to b*tch ...to get to my room i had to take an elevator to the third floor and then walk along a labrynth of hallways to another elevator and take another elevator to the 6th floor. This alone is worth avoiding this hotel unless one is desperate and gets put here in thier priceline bid. The Rooms were small.....weak water pressure in the shower .....pillows lumpy.....scary borderline unfriendly night staff ......i will avoid this hotel in the future. I paid $90US a night on priceline and that was too much....
195,617,"Mar 16 2006	Charming Charing Cross	Just returned from a 5 night stay in room 535. I booked through priceline at a price of 88us a night plus tax. Upon arrival, I was upgraded, my guess is because I gave them an imprint of my amex business card for incidentals which I didn't use. My room was perfectly suitable with not much of a view but offices which were far enough away to insure privacy.It was very quiet even though your're, in my opinion at the best location in the city to take in shows and right next to the train station. This and other thistle hotels have additional sound proofing windows along with their original which I used to store my coffee milk and juice as they do have a mini bar in the room and don't want you to use the fridge. The building itself is a stately old gem reminicent of days gone by and luxury for train travelers of yesteryear. The winding staircase is magnificent and can imagine all the use it got before elevators. I never waited for the elevator more than a few seconds and as other thistles they have beautiful prints in the hall for your walk to your room. This theme is of black and white ornamental architectual prints of the hotel and london. Right out front the door is a bus stop, number 11 goes to victoria station and the same bus also goes to chelsea. This locale you can walk to so many places but I did buy the bundled 6 bus tickes for 6pounds. You can also get tickets in front of the stop by putting in 150pound per ticked to be used within one hour. I used the double deckers and sat on top and saw more of London than booking the Original tour bus, which I made the mistake of purchasing. If you must, go with the big bus tour as they are more plentiful and the top is covered, a necessity in London weather. As a woman traveling alone, I felt very safe walking back to my room after the theater, something you could not do in other locales or any big city in the us. They're are plenty of dining choices around and the Sherlock Holmes pub is just down the street. There are Tescos all over for your provisions such as juice and milk, one right next to Trafalger Square which you reach by walking left from the hotel. I was there for the St. Pattys day festivites held in the Square. The National Gallery and Portrait Gallery is also there. Don't get sucked into buying a museum pass, as most are free. Don't miss the British Museum and Tate Modern. As I said, number 11 goes strait to the hotel from Victoria Station and 139 bus from Waterloo if your're going on the Eurostar. Most hotels have great central locations but I feel Charing Cross about the best."
196,617,"Mar 11 2006	Good hotel at a great location	We were very pleased with this hotel -- our first stay here. Great location for theatre, National Gallery, tube, Charing Cross station, etc. Staff was very helpful and polite. We upgraded to a small suite and were very pleased. There was a slight hum of traffic, but I am a very light sleeper and heard no noise in the hotel itself. We were in the newer rooms on the sixth floor. Separate shower stall which was a real treat. English breakfast was great. We would stay here again."
197,617,"Feb 6 2006	Fabulous location but some negatives...	Fantastic location at this hotel, we really were right in the middle of it. Trafalgar Square to the left, Covent Garden to the right and the Embankment and London Eye just behind us!We had problems with check-in where they gave us a twin room when we had booked a double but eventually that was sorted although the gave us a much smaller room then. Also problems on checking out as they had lost the prepaid voucher we had handed them the previous day.The rooms were lovely and breakfast was delicious although not enough staff to clear the tables so there were large queues of people waiting to be seated.One thing that was negative was the fire alarm going off at midnight. Two short beeps in the bedroom did not mean anything to us but we called reception who shouted at us to get out and then hung up on us.We rushed the fire escape in pyjama's only to find the reception staff milling around the doors smoking.Half an hour later we were let back in the hotel with no explanation or apology. Not much fun for the guests that were shivering outside in their dressing gown's.All in all a brilliant location with clean rooms but below average staff."
198,617,"Feb 6 2006	Wonderful	Myself and my boyfriend are just back from a great weekend (3-5 Feb) in London staying at the Thistle Charing Cross. We had one of the newly renovated room (522)with lovely red and cream decor. The staff were lovely and we couldn't fault the breakfast which was included with our package. We booked through Otel and got a great deal of 312 for two nights B&amp;B. You cannot get a more central location - literally twenty feet from the hotel entrance is Charing Cross train station and the Big Bus tour company ticket booth for one of the best open top bus tours around London, five minutes from Trafalgar Square and ten minutes from Leicester Square!!! Also three minutes from this hotel is the Sherlock Holmes pub (great little local pub). We went to two West End shows - Les Miserables and the Lion King - both within walking distances of the hotel or one tube ride away. Great weekend and I'll definitely be returning to the Thistle Charing Cross. I've found my London hotel!"
199,617,"Jan 30 2006	Loved this Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my Husband and 3 teens December 27th 2005 for 2 nights. I was not expecting too much from this hotel with its 3 star ranking, however I have to say we were all pleasantly surprised. We stayed in the new wing of the hotel in a Junior Suite and Double room. Both rooms were delightful, as were the staff. Interesting when you compare it to the previous hotel we stayed at in London (Claridges). The cost of this hotel was 1/4 of the amount we paid at Claridges and I have to say our experience was so much better. I love the location of the Thistle Charring Cross, perfect for the West End Theatres, and close to many attractions. If you are looking for a clean hotel in a great location this is the place for you. It is also one of the hotels available on Priceline."
200,617,"Jan 29 2006	Insufficient heating and noisy staircase doors	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and the room was always much colder than the hallway, even when turning the heating to the maximum. It was simply not strong enough for January. The bathroom did not have a heater to begin with, and when you're coming straight out of bed you may not feel like meeting the January cold in your bathroom. Also the stairway doors slammed noisily whenever used, which happened a lot because the elevator was out of order. We woke up a couple of times during the night. Finally, there were queues to be seated for breakfast, and service was extremely slow. When we complained to a manager about this, an apology was all we got. It's a pity that a hotel with nice rooms (ours was a President King, others may be smaller) in this nice area is so poorly managed."
201,617,"Jan 21 2006	Fantastic hotel in an even better location!	I stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross for the first two nights of a two week vacation to England. For most of the trip I stayed with friends but I needed a hotel to stay in London for the first and last two nights. I decided to spend more to get a nicer hotel for the first two nights. I had agonized over which hotel to choose. I am really glad I chose the Thistle. I got into the hotel and the staff was polite and helpful. My room was a deluxe room on the fifth floor. It was gorgeous. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was good too. My room and the hotel were very clean. I paid $316 incl. VAT through expedia for two nights (a Friday and Saturday). That was a great price!The best thing about this hotel however was it's centralized location. There was so much to do around the hotel. By walking distance I consider a ten minute walk or less. As far as Piccadilly Circus is within walking distance. You have that, Leicester Square (which has tons to do), Soho, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden all right near the hotel. What I realized after staying at a cheaper hotel in Bayswater is that being in the West End was ideal. This is because as a 20 year old college student, I wanted to go out to clubs and bars in Leicester Square area at night. However the tube stops running a little after midnight and I didn't want to fuss with a taxi or bus. At the Thistle I could easily walk back. Also the tube station has an entrance right below the hotel which is extremely convenient!The only gripe I have for this hotel is that they made it really difficult to make a calling card call. You had to dial the hotel operator and ask them to dial the number for you. I highly recommend this hotel especially if you can get it for less than $200 a night."
202,617,"Jan 20 2006	I wouldn't waste my money here	Arrived at 9:30 AM and there were two people trying to check out and about 20 people trying to check in. The lobby is very small and dark. This day their computers were down and were making people store their luggage until 12:00 PM. I couldn't complain because check-in isn't until 2:00 PM. I checked my luggage and then went off to have breakfast.I came back at 12:00 PM and then went to check-in. Had the same hotel staff member and he said that my room with a double bed was ready. I had requested twin beds. He than mumbled a couple words and then stuck me in the old wing of the hotel (Orginally I was in the new part). However the only way for me to get a room with twin beds was to take a room in the old wing.To get to the old wing you have to take the elevator up one floor, walk toward a conference/eating room, walk over a covered walkway, then take another elevator down. After about 10 minutes getting to my room, I arrived to an old, smelly, dark, damp room. The wall paper had yellow stains with the wall paper coming off by the window. The carpet had stains all over it and the beds were bad. There was no where to store your luggage either. The bathroom was ok - no real complaints here. Each night we heard drunk people fight out in the streets. Our room faced an alley which didn't look safe. On the morning we left for Scottland, we had to wake up at 3:30 and out the door by 4:30. I had asked the hotel staff to hail us a cab and have one waiting at 4:30. They said no problem. Arrived at 4:30 and they pointed toward the train station where there were three taxis. Went over to the taxis but they wouldn't take us to Victoria because it was too close. We then were harrassed by people in an unmarked van trying to take us to the train station. I then went out on the street to hail a cab myself. The hotel staff was very unhelpful here.No problems at checkout. Basically the location is good but can be sketchy. The old wing of the hotel is in bad shape so if you stay here make sure you ask to stay in the new wing."
203,617,"Jan 9 2006	Central Location is tough to beat.	We stayed at the Thistle for two nights between Christmas and New Year and thought enough of it to return a few weeks later with some other family members. It's nothing fancy, but I don't need fancy. My final rating was &quot;above average&quot; and all because of the location/cost ratio.The only negatives:Were told our room would not be read until 2pm, fair enough. We came back at 2:30 and it still wasn't ready. The clerk offered to buy us two drinks in the lounge. The lounge is worth a visit before heading for the evening.Our room keys (cards with magnetic strip) didn't work the first time and required a trip back down to get them re-coded.The positives:It's cheap.A good example of &quot;Railroad Hotel Architecture&quot;A Moderne room to contrast with industrial age victoriana.The amusing little electric signs you turn on and off for &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; or &quot;Please make up room&quot;Fun stair case to skip down.The first floor overpass over Villiers street. It leads to an annex of the hotel but even if your room isn't there go take peek.Location, Location, Location: I'm used to quiet residential settings for my hotel, but I could get used to this location really fast. Your on top of a tube station, and The Strand. You are almost on top of Trafalgar. Pleasant walks to: Westminster, Piccadily, Leicester, theaters, London eye, and another tube station, Embankment, that is on the circle/district lines. The central location also means there is almost anything you might need close by: drug store, pubs, underground wine bar, global chain coffee shop, sushi, breakfast crypts, quiet garden, mock-tudor public convenience, buses, thames, etc.Our room faced the back, no view of course, but was very quiet.If you are there during American Football season, you can easily walk to the Sports Cafe on Haymarket to watch the games late sunday evening.The neutrals:The hotel is well worn, some people find it a turn off yet other people love things with a bit of age.It's a big and busy and part of chain.I shall return."
204,617,"Jan 1 2006	More than I could have asked for!	I was expecting to be disappointed by the hotel because I have heard that hotels in London are small, overpriced, and have terrible service, but I was happily surprised. This hotel was great! The reception staff was very helpful. They helped us find a nice place to eat, gave us a free map of London (including tourist destinations), and stored our luggage for free after we checked out so that we could still walk around a bit without dragging our suitcases along. The rooms were gorgeous. There was a big desk in the room where you could work if you needed to, a minibar, a large bathtub (which is hard to find in hotels), and all of the essentials(coffee maker, hairdrier, etc.). The location was probably the best part. The hotel is basically right on top of the Charing Cross Station. We literally only had to walk a few steps to the underground. The hotel is also in walking distance of tourist attractions like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and Parliament Square, Westminster Abbey, Picadilly Circus, Covent Garden, and Trafalgar Square. Everything else is a short tube ride away. The only problem I can find is a limited selection of television channels. But for me this was not much of a problem because I was there to see London not stay in my room."
205,617,"Dec 7 2005 	Do not hesitate stay there.	I have stayed in the Thistle Charing Cross twice. This is an excellent hotel in a superb location. The staff is pretty helpful and the breakfast buffet is one of the best I have ever seen. The rooms are very nice and comfortable, even though the single ones are a little bit small and noisy.Do not hesitate to stay there if you will be in a double room. It is an excellent option near the main London attractions and theaters."
206,617,"Nov 5 2005	wonderful weekend at the Thistle Charing Cross	Had a wonderful weekend at the Thistle, Charing Cross to celebrate my 50th birthday. The location was superb,only a short tube ride to the London Eye and Westminster, and a short walk to Trafalgar Square. The bedroom was comfortable with a large bathroom, and the restaurants were both charming, and the staff friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a special French meal in the Strand Restaurant complete with Beaujolais Nouveau. We are looking forward to visiting this hotel again."
207,617,"Nov 1 2005	Buckingham wing is old	My room was in the Buckingham wing, which is the older annex wing of the hotel. It was very inconvenient to get to our room; I wondered what would happen if there was a fire! We had to take one elevator to get to the 3rd floor, then another to get to the sixth. The decor in the Buckingham wing is much more traditional than is shown in the user-submitted pictures. The room was of decent size, and all the appointments were clean, although the walls were VERY scuffed up with black marks. The bathroom was roomy. And the location is unbeatable."
208,617,"Oct 27 2005	Beautiful grand hotel!	I was quite nervous about staying at this hotel as it's a Thistle-they have some quite dire hotels! But this was real suprise!! It's situated on the Strand by Trafalgar Square above Charing Cross railway/tube station which apparently makes it 'Londons most central hotel.' The reception area is quite small but as you pass it you come to a very grand sweeping staircase which takes you to the first floor where there is a very ornate lounge (with a beautiful ceiling) and a very traditional lounge bar. Drinks are expensive as they're all served in large (50ml) measures but that was fine for me! Food in the resatuarant was of very high quality and presentation was second to none! Definately worth the high price tag! We chose to upgrade our room to a studio-deluxe and it was perfect-air-con, mini bar, spacious seating area, extra cupboard space and a spacious bathroom with separate shower cubicle. It looked very new and well kept. We had a great nights sleep with no noise from the busy streets below. Breakfast is served in the VERY GRAND Betjamen Room-a victorian masterpiece, you could stare at the ceiling for hours!! The buffet style breakfast was great and had a big choice for both English and Continental breakfasts. There is an annexe joint on to the hotel and half the rooms are based there. These rooms are more traditional but with all the same facilities as those in the main building. I heard a few people complaining they had to walk further and take two lifts to get there but they were American they love to complain!!Overall a fantastic hotel in the west end. Thoroughly recommended!"
209,617,"Oct 13 2005	The most perfect location imaginable for a London vacation	Thistle Charing Cross was really a perfect place to stay for our vacation in London. The room was small, yet very modern and comfortable in design and ammenities. Basically when it comes down to it, the hotel could have been pretty junky and we would have still been thrilled. Why? Because the location is simply amazing. It's within walking distance of almost every major London attraction: less than a block from Trafalgar Square. A short walk from Covent Garden, Picadilly Circus &amp; St. James Park. A medium walk to the theatre district, Big Ben, Westminister Abbey, and Downing Street. A longer walk to the London Eye and Buckingham Palace. What's even better is that if you feel lazy and don't want to walk (or if it's too hot/cold outside) the Charing Cross tube station is right across the street so you can ride the subway instead! Buses and cabs are constantly stopping just outside the hotel, which adds a couple other transportation options. If you're unfamiliar with London travel, you can buy a day pass that allows you to ride all subways, buses, and national rail trains within certain zones (the more you pay the further out you can travel). It makes getting around really simple, and the whole London transportation system is easy to learn. There's a decent pub just around the corner of the hotel called The Sherlock Holmes and a nice little convenience store right next to the hotel if you need a quick bite to eat and don't want to pay for expensive hotel food. On top of all this we got an amazing price for our room through bidding on priceline! Honestly, what more could you ask for? On a side note, we also stayed at the Waldorf Hilton, which is another common hotel for Mayfair/Soho four star bids through Priceline, and it was a little nicer hotel, but not quite as nice of a location. Overall we preferred Thistle Charing Cross."
210,617,Sep 29 2005	Great Location BUT	My wife and I stayed here for a week while we toured London. The location was great because the hotel is right downtown and central to just about everything.We had problems though. The night we checked in the room it was not a twin room as we had paid for. The room had been used because glasses were partially full and refreshments opened. The next day they did change our room to a lovely King room in the older part of the building.This hotel needs an ice machine because it takes an average of 30 minutes to get ice from room service. Our only other complaint is too few TV Stations.
211,617,"Sep 27 2005	Loved this hotel; two minor complaint	Have stayed at the Strand Palace, Radisson Pastoria and Mountbatten and Meridien Picadilly and the Thistle Charing Cross has them all beat. In my opinion, it has the best location of any London hotel, just a few minutes walk from Leicester and Trafalgar Squares, and Covent Gardens, and next to both the Charing Cross and Embankment tube stations. The hotel itself was clean, the amenities were great and best of all, fully air-conditioned, which is a big plus during a somewhat hot London weekend. My only complaints, and they're very minor, were the lack of a clock in the room (had to look at my watch in the middle of the night for the time) and the selection of tv channels. I know that with London at your doorstep, there's plenty to do outside. But after long days of walking around town, it would have been nice to wind down watching some tv. All that was offered were five local channels, two sports channels, CNN and Bloomberg, which for some reason, was always in Italian. However, other than these two minor issues, this is a top notch place and would recommended it highly to anyone going to London for business or pleasure."
212,617,"Sep 26 2005	Fabulous Location	My friends and I stayed in this hotel for three nights in September. The location is the biggest selling point for this hotel - it's right by Trafalgar Square and within walking distance of Westminster Abbey and Houses of Parliament/Big Ben. The hotel itself is right above the Charing Cross tube/rail station and about a block or two from the Embankment tube station.The rooms were quite nice, and our bathroom was very spacious. Given how expensive hotels are in London, we got these rooms for a fairly decent price through Hotels.Walking from the lobby to the rooms was a little odd, though. You had to climb the stairs (or take an elevator) up a level, walk down a hallway and then take another elevator up to the rooms. If you have mobility issues, this could be a pain.Also, the concierge was not helpful at all. We once asked him for a recommendation for a restaurant in a particular neighborhood. He said he wouldn't give a recommendation; instead, he handed us a list of restaurants, told us to pick one and then said he would call the restaurant for a reservation (as if we couldn't pick up the phone and call for reservations ourselves). That was a minor annoyance in an otherwise very pleasant stay."
213,617,"Aug 29 2005	Great location.	My first time in London, and I really like this hotel. Location was great, but my friends and I are avid walkers... so it took us about 20 minutes to walk to Buckingham Palace. I'm not sure most tourists would be willing to do that. Nevertheless, hotel was clean, close to metro, and a few blocks from the river. I traveled with a small group and each 2-person room was different. I happened to be in one of the &quot;newer&quot; rooms, so it seemed. I'd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat."
214,617,"Jul 30 2005	Excellent location and price!	I stayed here on a theatre break with a friend who was only in London for the night - we wanted somewhere central to the action so we didn't have to waste our time trying to get around on the tube. After days of reading trip report/hotel reviews, I finally settled on the Thistle Charing cross. I paid 115 (including taxes) for an Executive Twin room. This hotel sits almost directly on top of the Charing Cross train/tube station, but it's remarkably quiet. At night the trains were not noticible at all - in the late morning, I started to notice it a super tiny bit (more like aware of it's presence, it wasn't disturbing at all - and I'm a very light sleeper!). My room had views over the top of the train station, so no traffic noise at ll. The hotel is a 5 minute casual walk to Trafalgar Square, a few minutes further to Picadilly Circus. There is a bar and restaurant in the hotel, but we didn't use them. The room itself consisted of two single beds with duvets and blankets. One pillow on each bed plus a throw pillow - two additional pillows were in the wardrobe if we wanted them (sealed for our protection). The TV had all the usual bits and bobs - pay movies, radio, set wake-up call time. In the cabinet below the TV, there was tea/coffe with kettle (free) and a mini bar. There is a small table and chair located by the window. Near the hallway there is a dressing table - this is where the phone and network connections are. The hallway features wooden/laminate flooring and a double wardrom (iron &amp; trouser press inside). The bathroom is quite large for UK standards - has a shower stall and a bath. There is also a phone over the toilet (uh, no thanks) and I believe volume control so you can here the TV/radio. There was no need for the DO NOT DISTURB card - a switch sorted all that out. My room was on the 4th floor, at the end of the hall not too far from the lifts. Room service is available until 11pm, but I did not use it. There are loads of small shops in teh Charing Cross station if you require anything - the Boots there is very handy for toiletries forgotten.Highly recommended if you want a clean, decent sized place to stay in the center of London."
215,617,"Jul 25 2005	Great location great value	Stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross in July 2005 for two nights. Great hotel with reasonable sized rooms by European standard. Excellent location close to many attractions, West End Theatres, Trafalgar square, National gallery, Covent Garden and Leicaster Square. Literally steps away from the Underground stations of Charing Cross and Embankment. I paid $135 US per night. Thistle have a website were you can bid on stays. Would definitely stay there again."
216,617,"Jul 9 2005	Great deal for a super location	I had researched a lot of hotels for our stay in London and had come to the conclusion that an excellent location in central London near the theaters and Trafalgar Square would be out of our budget. Then I bid on priceline for Thistle Charing Cross for nine nights in June: got it at $100 per night, which ended up around 120 with taxes/fees. When we got to the hotel for check-in, a room was ready...my wife and I asked for twins to give us a little more room and sleeping comfort. The room was in an adjacent wing and was really nice. As soon as we opened the door and saw the lay-out, I knew I had the best deal I've ever gotten in several trips to Europe. The room itself had a nice bathroom, a safe, good cable TV and good beds. We loved being right at Trafalgar Square, and the hotel sits next to the Charing Cross train and tube stations, as well as a short walk to Embankment tube station and the Waterloo train station just a tube stop across the Thames. Theaters are within walking distance, as well as Leicester Square, Westminster Abbey and Covent Garden. Just down the street at the river, there is a boat dock for river cruises, as well as a pedestrian walkway across the river for easy access to the London Eye. Out on the Strand, the hotel's street, there are several conveniences: McDonald's (easy carry-out, cheap breakfasts), EasyInternetCafe (for web and email), Starbucks, and other nearby food vendors (E.A.T. and Pret have well-prepared sandwiches and carry-out foods). We used them a lot in London since the exchange rate for full meals makes restaurant food very expensive. We did eat at a restaurant here and there. We also found that the museum cafes have good food and convenient service. Also, theater tickets can be purchased at theater box offices and the half-price tkts booth at Leicester Square. Would recommend that any show you see have an air-conditioned theater: The Producers does not...hot! Well, anyway, with the Thistle Charing Cross as a convenient home base for nine nights, plus two nights arriving and departing at the Jurys Inn at Heathrow...it was a great trip!"
217,617,"Jun 28 2005	Loved the Thistle!	We loved this hotel! We found it on Londontown.com and cross checked it on Trip Advisor. We stayed there earlier this month for 5 nights. It's in the heart of London, the staff was great, the rates were good, the room is magnificent! We didn't have a view, but we had a huge bathroom, radio, hair dryer, fridge, big and cozy bed. We will definently stay here again, or any other Thistle hotels in England when we go back."
218,617,"Jun 27 2005	Great stay at the Thistle Charing Cross	Stayed at the Thistle Charing Cross from 5/29-6/1 2005. This hotel was a great deal for the price. Book online with Thistle directly and received a delux room (really a suite by London standards) for 109gbp per night. Hotel is in the middle of everything, a quick walk to Parliament Square, Piccadilly, and other top sites. Situated immediately between Charing Cross and Embankment stations. The best home-base I can imagine in London. Breakfast was included and was great. The staff was very helpful. The hotel is older, but the a/c and bathroom were up to US standards."
219,617,"Jun 8 2005	Good Hotel	Stay at the Thistle Charing Cross on May, 2005 for four nights. Good and clean hotel with a good size room by European standard. Excellent location as close to many attractions. Trafalgar square and the National gallery is right across the street. Covent Garden and Leicaster Square is about 10 minute walk. Literally steps away from the Underground stations of Charing Cross and Embankment. Suggest going on to the Thistle hotel site and book directly there as it offered a much cheaper rate than the other booking services. Breakfast was also good but got sick of it after 4 days !Would definitely stay there again."
220,617,"Mar 20 2005	Perfect London Location	Thistle Charing Cross is a perfect location if you want to be near the theatres. Three different tube stops are very close, and it's a quick walk to the tkts discount theatre ticket booth in Leicester Square and very close to the National Gallery (which is free). It's an elegant commercial hotel, and somewhat expensive, but definitely not at the top of London's rates. One can get special rates on line. We had breakfast included, which carried us through to an early dinner. Rooms are immaculate and well-equipped, staff is helpful. In Feb-March we stayed there for the third time and it really &quot;made&quot; our trip because it's so easy to get places: on foot, by tube, or on the bus."
221,617,"Jan 10 2005	Location is outstanding!	We stayed in this hotel via Priceline bid of $127 a night. Our stay was Dec. 15-20, 2004. We LOVED this hotel's location--it's right next door to the Charing Cross Tube, and Trafalgar Square is just a block away! In fact, we hardly had to take the Tube since everything was in walking distance. The bathroom was very roomy and came with a towel warmer, which we used every day to make our towels nice-n-toasty.The room comes provided with tea and biscuits, which are free. There's also a handy electronic &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; and &quot;Please Clean Room&quot; sign in case you want to sleep late. You just click on which one you want--that way no one knocks at your door at 8 a.m.Only negative was that our voicemail was down the entire five-day stay, so we had a blinking red light on our phone for several days. The concierge could not help us; we knew who had called, though, so we just shrugged it off.Otherwise hotel was wonderful--I highly recommend (esp. for the price we paid)!Here are two restaurant recs near the hotel: Simurgh (Persian cuisine) and the Green Man &amp; French Horn (English cuisine). Simurgh, located on Garrick St., is a bit pricey but very romantic--we celebrated our anniversary there. I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but I got a chicken and apricot dish that was outstanding! At the Green Man &amp; French Horn, located on St. Martin's Lane, the food is very good and serves continually all day and night. We had problems finding pub food at night in the theatre district, so we were very pleased to find this place and to eat such excellent bangers and mash!"
222,617,"Nov 29 2004	Great Location Good Enough Everything Else	The hotel is in a great location. It is right on The Strand, next to the Charing Cross train station, a few steps from the Embankment tube stop, which goes right into The City area. Neither Embankment nor Charing Cross are on the Picadilly Line (which runs directly from Heathrow) but you can't have everything. It is a very short walk to Trafalger, Covent Garden and Leicster Square. The room was fine (not The Ritz, but it was L110, not L350). Service was fine (nothing negative to report). Check in and check out were great. I'd stay again."
223,617,"Nov 21 2004 	Great Location but a disappointing room.	There is much to praise about this hotel. The location on the Strand is an excellent base for visiting London. The public areas of the hotel are very elegant. There is a 24 hour lounge which is ideal for meeting colleagues and clients, or afternoon tea after a day in London. The hotel staff were also very helpful.However, my room in the Buckingham Wing did not match the standards of the public areas of the hotel. The decor was a little &quot;busy&quot; for me. The bathroom was very cold. My room service meal was insubstantial and poorly presented. Also, in the era of 200+ digital TV channels, the DVD, and Personal Video Recorder, a couple of extra TV channels in addition to the five main UK channels isn't enough for the frequent business traveller who just wants a night in front of the TV."
224,617,"Nov 18 2004	Hit and miss	Beware which wing they put you in! Wing inside main building has been renovated, rooms OK but small. In old wing, over the bridge, rooms victorian, awful, like 1970s. Braodband does not seem to work in any of the rooms, weird system not even the 24 hour support staff unedrstand. despite location, not a business hotel, tourist base. Lifts tiny and don't work, have to walk around a lot in mazy corridors, breakfast in betjamin room v. good but rip off at GBP16! Strand terrace breakfast cheaper but could not find staff to serve me last time there. Lobby tiny, not many staff speak english."
225,617,"Nov 1 2004	A Great Base in London	The hotel is very comfortable and although my room was compact it was extremely well appointed with a well equipped spotless bathroom. There are some impressive architectural features and house-keeping standards are high.The location is superb and although my room overlooked the station forecourt and The Strand the room was extremely quiet.Two words of warning. The bar serves only 'double' measures so a V&amp;T costs 6.50 and breakfast, if not included in your booking, costs 16.50!For comfort, location, access to sites and transport its pretty well unbeatable."
226,617,"Oct 26 2004	Great rooms location	Spent three days here in October. The location is very good, just opposite St. Martin's in the Fields church, one block from either Embankment or Trafalger Square, easy walk to Big Ben etc. (while it is faster to turn left out of the hotel and walk down the Strand, the most charming walk is to turn right, walk down to the Thames, turn right again and pass the Houses of Parliment, turn right as you come to Big Ben and see Westminster Abby), Covent Garden or West End theater district. Rooms are very large for London, service friendly, wonderful dining room for breakfast, reasonable prices. We recommend Gordon's wine bar just around the corner opposite Embankment Tube Station (over 200 years old, sit in the back but watch your purse)."
227,617,"Aug 23 2004	Great experience at Thistle Charing Cross	We got our room at Thistle Charing Cross through priceline.com and could not have been happier with the result. The location right next to the tube station can't be beat, we didn't realize how great it was until staying at a different hotel after returning from France. I never felt the trains going by, it was not an issue. Our room was modern, had A/C and a large bed. The only problem we had was that our room was actually in a separate building connected by an enclosed walkway which meant taking 2 different lifts, but this was not a major issue, just alittle confusing at first. I would stay there again (for priceline $)"
228,617,"Aug 10 2004 	Good but could be better	The plusses: 1--air conditioning, which is necessary in summer London for the humidity if not the heat unless you are on the ground floor and can open windows. The previous &quot;four star&quot; (what a joke) hotel at which I had stayed hotel put me in an attic room with no a/c, and no cross ventilation or fans. Although it was in the 70s outside, the room was much hotter. The a/c at Thistle was welcome. 2--nice location; you are near not only the tube but a railway stop that can take you out of town. Unlike other reviewers here, I DID feel the trains but got used to them. 3--they said they upgraded me to a nice larger room without extra charge--don't know why. The minuses: 1--to use the high speed internet access, you must click on a page accepting the terms. Once you do, you can use the service for a charge per minute. Among the terms is that the maximum you will be charged per 24 hours will be 15 pounds. I accepted these conditions, and one day when I had a lot of messages to respond to, I used a lot of time, thinking that the maximum would be 15 pounds. However, sure enough, when I got my draft bill, I was charged per minute of usage, well over the 15 pound maximum. I spoke with the manager who seemed unfamiliar with the contract terms and at first said this was for our business customers (not sure why she assumed I was not a business customer nor why that was relevant). I politely asked her what exactly this 15 pound limit meant, if not what I said it did. She then agreed she would look at the site's description of the terms I had agreed to, and that she would call me back. She did not call me back and when I checked out the next AM, the charges had not been changed (surprise!). It's not worth the time and effort to fight this, but if you use the high speed access, be aware that you may be ripped off by being charged something OTHER than what you agreed to. 2-although the room was pleasant (view wasn't) and nicely updated, there were signs of water damage around baseboards near the closet and cracks in the tiles in the shower. The toilet didn't flush properly every time--seemed to be a water pressure problem. The laundry line across the bathtub is a nice amenity, but a part was missing, so that when you put a wet garment on it, it sagged and the line could not be tightened. 3--if you reserve through CheapTickets, you will not be told that (a) the cancellation time refers to LONDON time, rather than EST which other time deadlines on the same email you get from then. This day and time was also several days before the hotel's deadline. But I was unable to cancel the reservation online or via phone with CheapTickets.com after I found that the hotel itself offered a much cheaper rate close to the date of my travel, and was given no explanation and was cutoff after 20 minutes on hold. I can only surmise that, while I was calling before the time on the confirming email EST, it was after the stated deadline hour if you used London time. So, make your reservation early, but check the hotel's website well before the deadline LONDON time, to make sure you get the best price."
229,617,"Jul 10 2004	Thankful for Thistle	Thistle Charing Cross was a pleasant suprise. Spent many hours online trying to find a reasonably priced room in London when we finally decided to let Priceline make the decision. We booked two rooms, 1 double and 1 twin (with 2 beds). Both rooms were clean and modern. When we arrived and located the hotel, we were a little worried because it was next to the train and subway station but it couldn't have worked out better. The location was great. Within walking distance to most sights. The train station came in very handy when we took a day trip to Dover. Staff was friendly. We had the buffet breakfast the first morning but it was so/so and expensive! The train station catered to early commuters so we grabbed coffee and breakfast pastires for cheap.I would definately stay here again (if I could get a good price)."
230,617,"Jun 19 2004	Good location and (some) good rooms	I think that the hotel must be undergoing bedroom refurbishment as the Twin Room that we stayed in was one of the best rooms in London that I've stayed in at this level.Check in was great with very friendly staff (and you generally have to admit that's not a given in London!), beds comfortable, bathroom clean and modern. An inside room with a view of (I think) the leisure suite didn't provide the best visual experience, but on the rate we were on that really wasn't an issue (NB: Shop around, there are good rates available at the last minute here).Breakfast, buffet, was good in a great setting, the dining room was pretty swish! Food fine, coffee (after the night before...) refreshing!Location-wise, can't beat it. 3 minutes from Trafalgar Square, 10 from Leicester Square, 10 from Westminster - ideal holiday hotel in that sense. It's right on the Strand too - hey, if it's good enough for the Savoy...!"

1,618,Oct 24 2009 	The nicest hotel in London	Definitely the nicest boutique hotel in London in one of the nicest neighborhoods. A 3 minute walk to the clubs of Soho and with Regents Park just to the North you can play Jane Austin al the time!
2,618,"Sep 29 2009 	Luxurious home-from-home	I've stayed here twice on my own, on both occasions it has been totally superb. The first time I stayed I received a warm welcome to the hotel, my room had been upgraded and I was allowed into it slightly early allowing me time to get to a meeting.I had dinner in the restaurant with a friend, the waiter knew it was the first time I had stayed and offered us a complimentary glass of champagne. Having stayed in alot of varied hotels in London, that kind of attention to detail is rare, well actually I've never had it anywhere else... The food was good, wine list varied. Don't think I can say enough good things about this place, I wanted to move in and now spend most months working out when I can get back down to my favourite hotel. The area is great too, a quiet pocket but handily great for drinks in soho, shopping and pretty much everything you need in London. Loads of other restaurants nearby too if you don't want to go far."
3,618,"Jun 28 2009 	Didn't realise there were hotels this good in London!	I have to say I was completely blown away by this place - admittedly this may partly be due to the fact that I was whisked off here as a surprise for my 30th birthday - but nonetheless the level of service and personal attention was brilliant. We were given a guided tour of the lounge and library area downstairs (love the Honesty Bar!), and then showed to our room where we were brought glasses of complementary champagne. Nice touch. The chap showing us around was friendly, courteous and knowledgeable - pretty much faultless service.At the risk of rambling on: beautiful room, well kitted out (good hairdryer, plenty of toiletries, robes, massive towels, tv+dvd player, umbrella in case you forgot yours!), delicious cooked breakfast brought to our room, very good air-con, fantastic shower (plus neat steam-proof mirror)...... and the room was so QUIET, which was amazing as Charlotte Street is hardly a sleepy part of town. For those of you not familiar with London, the location of this hotel could hardly be better: it's walking distance from Oxford Street shops, and there are loads of bars and restaurants right outside the hotel; plus there is a tube station just around the corner.I can't comment on price/value as obviously this stay was a surprise for me - but if you're after something a bit special, then this is your spot."
4,618,"Jun 14 2009 	My favourite hotel in London possibly anywhere!	We have stayed in this hotel on 3 occasions. On the 2nd visit there were building works in the lobby, which we were upset about as the stay was to celebrate a special occasion. We explained our situation and were immediately offered an upgraded room in the Soho hotel, another Firmdale gem. Ok, ideally we should have been told about the building when we booked, but as the problem was dealt with so well and quickly we were still impressed. And in addition to the upgrade, we were then offered a complimentary night back at the Charlotte street to be taken any time in the future - brilliant customer service. All the staff we met on each occasion were excellent, nothing too much trouble. On our last visit we were celebrating our 10th anniversary and were given champagne, a beautiful scented candle and even some bath and massage oil. Breakfast is pricey, but you don't have to take this option and there are a dozen decent coffee bars around where you can have something more reasonable.The decor is great, rooms small (unless you go for one of the luxury ones) but very nice and very well equipped and a brilliant location for Oxford St, Soho, Theatreland etc. It is an expensive hotel, but you are right in the heart of town and you get what you pay for. We love it and can't wait to go back."
5,618,"Apr 28 2009 	Very disappointing	Just returned from Charlotte Street hotel for my birthday weekend and am very disappointed. It is part of the same group at The Haymarket, and bears no comparison. We stayed at The Haymarket last year and it was just perfect, staff, service, rooms - everything was 100%. Charlotte Street is lacking - at least for the price. Our room was small, view of some ugly air conditioning units outside, no seperate shower, no tea and coffee making tray - altogether not what we were expecting. The lady on reception asked me if the room was ok - I told her how I was feeling, and then they proceeded to do nothing about it!! WHY ASK???? A small gesture of a bottle of wine in the room - something that would only cost them a fiver - but would have made me feel less disgruntled - that was all it would have taken.The breakfast - for 19.50 was grim. I had poached eggs and the plate was swimming in water - resulting in wet soggy bread - yuk! We ordered a paper and got the wrong one, and the second breakfast - in the room this time - was cold and totally inedible.This is not a Travel Lodge for goodness sake - so not what you expect for 225.00 per night.If you're going to book a london Hotel give this one a miss and try The Haymarket - you won't be disappointed!"
6,618,"Mar 15 2009 	Oasis in Fitzrovia	Katja, the Hotel Manager made this stay special, her attention to detail and service was personal and professional. The hotel is charming, warm, luxurious and elegant in a bustling area of London, with great restaurants, pubs and a lively youthful excitement. Young business people frequent the area as well as University students.We stayed with our son who is studying at NYU London for the semester. We all enjoyed our stay in a beautful, large junior suite, with a spa like bath, most appreciated by our dorm living student. But, we all enjoyed every minute of our stay."
7,618,"Dec 8 2008 	Charming and Efficient	Stayed 3 nights during Thanksgiving week. Room was impeccably maintained and comfortable. WiFi worked well, if expensive. Staff was friendly but not chummy. Location truly cannot be beat--walk to Theater, Soho, Oxford Street!!"
8,618,"Dec 8 2008 	So Disappointed!!	Just back from a disappointing stay at Charlotte Street. I had been so looking forward to our weekend break away but for me unfortunately Charlotte St just did not do it for me at all. I always prefer to stay in a small boutique hotel for the more personal touch but it just didnt seem to be happening here. First off we arrived early in the morning, too early for check in so left our bags at reception for a wander around the city. We had booked a show and dinner so rushed back to the hotel to have a quick shower in the evening and head back out but after checking into our room unfortunatley we found our shower was broken, we then had to ring maintenace and wait for this to be repaired. Unfortunately this meant having to cancel dinner as it went on for quite a while. Also sitting in my room while 2 guys from maintenace trudged in and out was slightly off putting to say the least!! I Anyway off we went to the show and had something to eat afterwards but arriving back at the hotel to have a drink in the bar was somthing else. At least 3 members of staff stopped us and asked us our room number ( at the door to the hotel, on the way to the bar by two staff members and again at the bar). They asked us to take a seat in the drawing room where they would bring us our drinks instead. It couldnt have been any later than 11:15 so its not like we were keeping them up until all hours of the morning. We waited 15 minutes for a glass of wine and a beer. It gets better, they have this lovely idea of an honesty bar....supposedly you can take a drink that you like from this bar and write on the book what you have taken and your room number. While we sat there drinking our drinks that we had ordered from the bar and signed for, at least four times the staff came in clearly to check what we were drinking then they would go to the &quot;honesty&quot; bar count all the items to make sure everything was there, I don't know if they thought we were going to clear the bar out or what but one drink there was certainly enough for us. The thing that really ticked me off tho was breakfast!!! When I am paying well over 600 for two nights including breakfast I think its a bit cheeky to get charged for a glass of juice and a bowl of cereal as a breakfast supplement,,,,I mean seriously are things that bad??? That was the final straw for me really. I had enough of Charlotte St and was just sooo disappointed. I had put alot of thought into booking this hotel as it was part of a surprise for my partners birthday but I just felt that any extra charge they could put on the bill they would. So if I were to go to London again I am afraid I would not be staying here. The hotel itself is lovely, so pretty from the outside but I just think it was a bit of a rip off and the staff just didnt have that lovely quality that you usually find when you stay at a smaller boutique hotel. I fell that my money could definitely have been spent a lot better."
9,618,"Oct 10 2008 	Poor value for Money during a credit crunch	Im afraid that I found the Charlotte Street hotel poor value for money. Great location, but not really my cup of tea.The room that we were assigned was tiny and had a horrible brown pattern on the walls, bedspread, curtains etc. It made the room feel very claustrophobic. For a 5-star hotel, the hotel had very poor sound-proofing  you could hear the upstairs neighbours very easily and the constant door-slamming in the hallway drove us mad in the morning.I found the bed very small for two people and the pillows way too soft. The shower was hot and powerful, but the bath was very deep and short people might have problems stepping out of it. However, the bathroom amenities were top-notch. On the positive side, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I would only recommend this property if you are on an expense account and looking for a great location. There are better value-for-money hotels in London."
10,618,"Sep 8 2008 	Highly Recommended	Following the overwhelmingly good reviews of the Charlotte Street Hotel on this website, I booked a weekend break for my wife and myself to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and I am extremely glad I did. The Hotel was excellent. Situated just north of Oxford Street, it is within walking distance of many places of interest, and sits within a lively area with many bars and restaurants, but is not affected at all by traffic noise. The staff were very attentive and helpful, and did all they could to make our stay a pleasant one, and they totally succeeded. Although we only had breakfast at the hotel, we mean to try the restaurant the next time we stay, as the food was very good. The rooms were well presented and equipped, and we left with the feeling that we'd had a great experience, and one we want to repeat. Highly recommended"
11,618,"Aug 8 2008 	Wonderful Stay	My wife and I stayed at Charlotte Street from June 17th through 20th. We were there for part of our vacation and it was truly a wonderful experience. We would definitely return. Charlotte Street would fit into the category of what we would call a &quot;boutique&quot; hotel in the U.S. We stayed in a &quot;luxury double&quot; room with a king-sized bed. The room was nicely decorated and more than adequate in size. What made Charlotte Street excellent were the little extras that are not always found in other hotels, like luxury bedding, soft robes, scented relaxation oil, bottled water by the bed in the evening, and a helpful staff that went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed or wanted whenever we asked. The bathroom was also large enough, with granite tile, dual sinks, and a heated mirror. We had a room at the end of the hall, and despite the bustle outside, our room was totally quiet. The restaurant and lounge were always busy, and while slightly pricey, the food was very good. There was no shortage of restaurants and pubs within 2 blocks of the hotel. Oxford Street shopping and the nearest tube station were only several blocks away as well. Overall, we'd recommend a stay at Charlotte Street, and we will return if we are in London again."
12,618,"Jul 31 2008 	Great Hotel - will return!!	A great hotel!Friendly staff, very efficient, excellent food.What's there not to like?TIP: Keep bathroom door shut - heat of towel rail makes room hot and a/c has to work too hard."
13,618,"Jun 5 2008 	Best hotel I have ever stayed in!	This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in! I can not find one negative thing to say about it. Stay, if you can afford it!"
14,618,"Jun 1 2008 	Great Location. Excellent Hotel.	Location: Located in a great area close to 2 London tube stations. Almost 20 very nice restaurants across 2 adjoining blocksLobby/Look of Hotel: Very European. Hotel on street. Very unassuming but clean and niceRoom: Excellent. Very clean. Well furnished. Great bed linen. Bathroom very clean with 5 tub and shower.Hotel Restaurant: Great for a drink if you come in late at night. Restaurant closes around midnight but they move you to comfortable sofas in their cozy living room with an open bar and an &quot;honesty&quot; service (you sign for your drinks)Spa/Gym: Gym is small..1 tradmill, i cycling machine, some weights. But I never found anyone there..you should easily be able to get in a workoutService: The staff is very friendly. Also the room is cleaned twice a day..(small thing.. but at night they leave this pillow mist on the bed..which is a nice touch). Price included breakfast which could also be room service. We had omlette, coffee/tea and sausages..which was included and delivered in form of a wake up call. Great!Price: Found it a great deal at 215GBP per night before VAT. This included breakfast for 2.Other: N/A"
15,618,"Apr 12 2008 	problems at charlotte street?	This was my fourth stay at Charlotte Street. I usually love this hotel, but this visit had some problems: they were painting the floor I was staying on, meaning that a painter, paint fumes, and vacuum noises permeated the small (and stuffy) hallway in front of my room; one of the hotel's two elevators was broken, meaning all staff and guests were forced to use one poky elevator; the housekeeping service seemed much more lax than on previous visits -- the rooms were tidied up at odd hours and quite late in the day for twice a day service; my shower was broken when I arrived and needed to quickly shower, change and leave the premises. For the amount you pay to stay at the Charlotte Street, these are not small matters. The front desk people are all very lovely but sometimes indifferent. Some were indeed quite nice and helpful, but others not so much. It remains a beautiful, well-located hotel, but the management, maintenance and service were surprisingly lacking this time around."
16,618,"Mar 31 2008 	charlotte street	excellent hotel with a small, boutique feel in the heart of central london. very relaxing, clean and comfortable.I stayed only for one night recently and it was an excellent base to walk around zone 1 - charlotte st itself; soho; down to china town, cov gdn and so on. ate at Roka next door which was excellent.for some reason the hotel itself had issues delivering breakfast on the sunday. they did not seem overly busy but it took a while for the food to arrive. they were apologetic and helpful though, and we had newspapers and coffees so did not really care.very relaxing."
17,618,"Mar 31 2008 	Little gem	This hotel has great staff. The location is perfect for the west end bars, clubs and shops. The hotel bar is trendy and the food is quite good. The hotel tends to quote prices net of vat so when you check out, you are in for a shock. Service charge is added to everything in the bar, which I think is wrong and should be left upto the customer to decide. Nice atmosphere trendy and cool, but expensive. (Breakfast for two 50 ontop of 300 for the room)"
18,618,"Mar 26 2008	Perfect.	We spent a night at the Charlotte Street Hotel a few months ago and absolutely loved it. It's a wonderfully calm oasis in a great part of town. Our room was fantastic, wonderful decor and very confortable. Service is impeccable, but surprisingly the atmosphere is very relaxed. The whole stay was perfect from beginning to end."
19,618,"Jan 31 2008	No where better in London	Had a great stay with stylish room, amazing service and great food..... The area is lovely with great little restaurants &amp; shops and good access to the theatres and shopping...Perfect."
20,618,"Jan 31 2008	Simply The Best Hotel In London	I have stayed in all the big hotels in London over the past 20 years and I have to say, categorically, this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. A combination of superb staff, wonderful decor and a genuine feeling of escapism, makes this the perfect hotel. Faultless!!I have never written a review before but the hotel was so fantastic I felt compelled to write.Dreamy!!!!!!!!!!"
21,618,Jan 2 2008 	Perfect	A wonderful hotel. The room was well appointed with everything we needed. Our meal in the restaurant was not cheap but excellent. The only thing to avoid is the overly expensive internet access. Would we stay again - oh yes indeed!
22,618,"Nov 26 2007	Home Away From Home	I had the pleasure of spending one night at Charlotte Street Hotel and I was extremely impressed not only by the fantastic ambiance and comfort of the hotel but also with the staff's first class and professional approach when dealing with their guests. I found that the staff had the ability to make you feel very welcome and make you feel as though youre their only customer. The staff members are obviously well trained by its management. This is customer service at its best, world class!I had booked the junior suite and found it breath taking. What a welcoming feeling, from the beautifully decorated room with a bath which was just heavenly and a bed which you can crawl into and just hibernate for a few months. In particular, I liked the fact that Charlotte Street has that homely feel to it. Once in the room, it doesnt feel like you're at a hotel but more like youre relaxing at home. Its really home away from home. I also had the opportunity to eat in its lovely restaurant and found the food to be world class. One of my favourite meals to eat is their club sandwich; its unique in its taste and is consistently good every time. I would suggest the Charlotte Street Hotel to anyone, from business professionals to persons just wanting to get away. Its the perfect sanctuary to just relax, let go of all your inhibitions."
23,618,"Oct 22 2007	What a gem...	Amazing rooms, beautifully appointed in a relaxed yet fashionable style with none of the pretence of other London 5 stars.They have adorable extras in all the rooms (eye masks, lavender pillow sprays, beautiful toiletries, hangover kits in the minibar).The location is fab for bars and restaurants in Fitzrovia and the hotel itself has a bar which is a hit with post work drinkers. The breakfasts were great and the service polished and efficient and I would reccomend this hotel to anyone very highly (though would note for siteseeing and high end shopping e.g. Bond Street &amp; Knightsbridge) the location is not the best.A hotel not to be missed, I would return again, and again..."
24,618,"Oct 7 2007 	Wow Wow Wow!!!	Just got back from a fantastic nights stay at the Charlotte Street Hotel. We wish we could have stayed longer.I booked a Loft Suite, which was amazing (and really impressed the girlfriend :o) Everything about the room was just perfect, from the fresh flowers too the two Loewe flat screen tellies!!The Staff at reception were great, and bent over backwards to make sure everything was just right! We even borrowed a couple of their DVD's from the Hotels extensive collection. Whilst we didn't eat from the restaurant itself, we did get room service and breakfast delivered to the room, and it was all very nice!If you get the chance to spend a night heredo it!!"
25,618,"Aug 30 2007	Oh to be able to stay there regularly...	I was treated to an unexpected stay in London and ended up at the CSH. It was wonderful. Everything you could wish for: beautiful hotel, delightful staff, perfect bedrooms (wonderful Miller Harris products in the bathrooms)... It really was hard to get up and leave the next day. Only minor gripe is that breakfast and VAT weren't included in the price quoted which made for a jolt when paying the bill. That aside, I would definitely stay again and am in fact planning my next visit."
26,618,"Aug 26 2007 	Didn't want to leave !	Great hotel, nice amenities,great restaurant, wonderful staff and great location. What else do you want?"
27,618,"Aug 18 2007 	Heaven!	True paradise. Never had such wonderful, efficient and quick service. My partner is allergic to wheat and dairy and the restaurant manager did not bat an eye lid. He said we could have what ever we wanted! never had that said to us before. We had a junior suite and it was lovely. Light, airy and very clean. Understated luxury! The only downside is that it looked over some bars/pubs which kept us up until midnight. The hotel is small enough to give personal service but big enough to have all the facilities you want. Its not cheap but you really do get what you paid for here!!! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to treat themselves. The downstairs bar is very lively and we say a lot of famous people there."
28,618,"Aug 17 2007	Lovely Hotel Excellent Location	Our stay was on a Wednesday evening having been lucky enough to win a competition which included an overnight stay at the Charlotte Street Hotel. We had a superior room on the second floor at the back of the hotel. Breakfast is not included in the price of the room.The room itself was beautiful. The bed was massive - firm mattress, plenty of pillows. It was so high that when we sat on it, our feet didn't reach the floor. The bathroom was luxurious with a large bath, separate shower cubicle, toilet and bidet, cotton towels, bathrobes and slippers - not forgetting plenty of Miller Harris miniatures. An excellent hair dryer was provided as was an umbrella (which we made good use of with our Engligh summer!). The television service offered many satellite channels (including Sky Sports). DVDs, Play-Stations and mini-iPods were availble from reception. Whilst we were out inthe evening, the room was serviced and complimentary bottles of mineral water were left by on bed side tables together with additional (herbal) miniatures. The mini-bar was well stocked (and priced in line with the room prices) but we didn't allow ourselves to be tempted. A full laundry service was available, as were irons and ironing boards which housekeeping will bring to your room.Breakfast is served in the restaurant / bar on the ground floor. We opted for the 'Full Oscar' - fruits, yogurts etc, followed by a choice of cooked breakfast. I ordered smoked salmon and scrambled egg with mushrooms - the plate arrived with one (flat)mushroom, which we thought was quite funny. Hubby had an omlette with haddock. It was all delicious and service was friendly and attentive. In all honesty though - if we had to pay for our own breakfast, we would have popped out to a cafe around the corner.Also on the ground floor were 2 small lounges, beautifully furnished, for the exclusive use of guests.The only disturbance I heard was from the early visit of bin men -but they were soon gone. I made the most of my good fortune in the morning, and lazed about in the large sunny room reading my complimentary newspaper unitl checkout at 11am. After that, it was back to work and back to reality after my bubble of opulance.Overall the hotel was beautiful and all of the staff were friendly, helpful and ready with a smile. The only downer for me was the lack of a kettle (I am a real little t-pot) - but there was 24 hour room service if required. If you are looking for somewhere special I can thoroughly recommend the Charlotte Street hotel. It was simply delightful."
29,618,"Apr 23 2007 	Wonderful Hotel in Great Area!	What an awesome stay! Just returned from a 4-day stay at The Charlotte Street Hotel. We had stayed at the Soho Hotel a year earlier and liked that experience so much that we wanted to try one of its sister hotels. The room and the service were exactly on par with the Soho Hotel. The location was even better! It felt even more neighborhoody. It truly felt like our home in London. The service was incredible and the room was HUGE (for this city). It was impeccably decorated and maintained. Plus, the bathroom was huge with a separate tub and shower! The room also had a flat screen TV with HD, and a DVD player. The caf was delicious (although pricey) and the pub across the street was bustling. In addition ,a variety of superb restaurants line the street.The ONLY downside of the hotel was the gym. I was extremely disappointed in the equipment. It was a tiny room with 3 machines and some weights. I could have dealt with the size of the room, but the actual machines were disgusting and old. I was shocked that this beautiful hotel would have such a nasty, tiny gym. The Soho Hotel had a nice size workout room with new equipmentI expected something similar from this hotel. I would stay at the Charlotte Street Hotel again in a secondI just wouldnt plan on working out there!"
30,618,"Feb 20 2007	Servie dissappointing for price!	Although we work in London we stayed in this hotel for our anniversary staying in a deluxe room. The hotel is funky and our room was a great size, beautifully decorated in a contemporary style with nice touches. As the hotel is in central London the bar was busy but hotel guests can have drinks in one of 2 reception rooms which were warm and inviting. The problem was that service although friendly was extremely slow both in taking our orders and then bringing the drinks. There is a honesty bar in the larger of the two sitting rooms which is great unless you want a particular wine off the good wine list. We also had to move rooms once we had retired to bed at 1.30am as there was a noisy air conditioning unit which prevented us from going to sleep although the next morning they said no one had complained of any noise before and after some pushing offered us complimentary breakfast. With our total bill ex dinner coming at nearly 500 and without breakfast not being included in the room rate there are probably better hotels to stay in the capital."
31,618,"Feb 19 2007 	Start your romantic weekend here	It's been a few days since my wife and I returned from a night's stay Charlotte Street Hotel and she is still being nice to me! Of course it helped that we stayed in the junior suite, that we had a bottle of champagne waiting for us and that we had a fantastic breakfast delivered to our room in the morning. And yes, it helped that I paid 400 per night (including VAT, that is - can anyone tell me when London hotels stopped including VAT in their quoted rates?), but judging from the reviews on this site, even at that price London hotels seem to be bit hit and miss.Perhaps it was the attentive, but unobtrusive service, or was it the generous size of the rooms in a classic, unfussy style that you would expect from a boutique hotel. Put all that in a side street off Oxford Road where it is quiet enough to get a good night's sleep, but close enough to Soho to be part of the action - and you have the makings of a romantic weekend in the big city."
32,618,"Feb 13 2007	Cant rave enough about the place	I stayed at the Charlotte Street Hotel a weekend in February (2 nights) and I cant rave enough about the place although it is expensive.We had booked a Luxury double and were upgraded on arrival to a Suite in the loft with views over the rooftops (expensive became less so!). The hotel is beautifully designed by Kit Kemp and each room is individual. Apparently Kit oversees every element in every room and I can certainly say that ours was lovely. It has a restaurant onsite - Oscars and 24hr room service. Whilst we didnt eat in the restaurant I can say that the food was good from room service (and prompt too!).One of the best bits though was our room had its own button in the lift!Our lovely suite was so light and bright and fantastically designed with separate bathroom, living room and bedroom. The bathroom had double sinks and separate shower enclosure  which could have housed a whole rugby team. There was even a skylight. The smellies were delightful and broke from the boutique norm of Molton Brown. The living room was beautifully laid out with a cosy sofa and chairs and book cases filled with books  it felt very English in an unstuffy lack of chintz way. and I could see the London eye from the Sofa (which was glowing pink at night). The bedroom was huge by London standards and had a canopied bed and plenty of hanging space and storage (again a rarity). There was another TV here and radio on the bedside table, I found the bed a little bit hard although my husband thought it was spot on. The room was so nice I didnt want to leave and go anywhere else. However the shops beckoned and we did  the hotel is in North Soho or Bloomsbury (depending on your map) just north of Oxford Street and to the west of Tottenham Court Road so plenty of shops on the doorstep. The second night we had dinner in a Japanese restaurant (Roka) down the road recommended by the hotel that we pre-booked. The recommendation was very good and Im glad we booked although Charlotte Street is bedecked with eateries.Wanting to get back to our lovely hotel we came back to the Drawing Room where there was an open fire and an honesty bar. Unlike another reviewer who found this an unpleasant experience, we didnt encounter any problems jotting down the extent of our libations. Only downside  we didnt have long enough to take advantage of all the bells and whistles, bathroom was up two small steps so in the night I inevitably stubbed my toe and upon check out it was difficult to get a taxi (although this was because London had ground to a halt for the Baftas).Can definitely say well be back and maybe well see more of the hotel next time."
33,618,"Dec 1 2006 	Worthwhile........but	Charlotte Street Hotel is a member of the Firmdale Group of hotels (see their website) and is positioned well for shopping and also for dining with many small restaurants nearby. The rooms in the hotel are beautifully presented - the dcor modern with a classic twist. Bathrooms and showers are top class and personal touches like the welcome gifts really make the place special. We have stayed at Charlotte Street a number of times for business and pleasure. We have also stayed at the Soho Hotel and the Covent Garden Hotel which are also part of Firmdale group and are similarly furnished to Charlotte Street. So if one is fully booked we usually stay at another. These hotels while great are also very expensive if you stay regularly (there appears to be no loyalty programmes). This time at Charlotte Street, we paid around 320 for our double deluxe or was it a luxury double and this price did not include breakfast. The room was, as usual, all class, beautifully presented and impeccably clean. The bed though was indeed small (see comments on Trip Adviser) but this has not always been the case in other rooms we have stayed in at the hotel.The only real blight on the horizon for me is the service at breakfast. In fact, this time it was so appalling I felt like crying. I ended up having to almost crash tackle a waiter to get a cup of coffee. I then had to use similar techniques to get juice and water. After achieving the impossible and placing an order for a full breakfast I then waited a considerable length of time for my breakfast to be delivered  long enough for me to almost query if my order had been mislaid. Now I was not alone in my battle for service - there were comments from other tables on these very issues. Breakfasts in this hotel are expensive  starting at 19 for a continental rising to 28 for a full so one would assume service is mandatory. In actual fact, you would find better service in an automatic food dispenser shop. Now this is not just a Charlotte Street Hotel issue I have had similar ongoing experiences at Firmdale's Covent Garden Hotel as well. This level of service offered might suffice for the holidaymaker on the occasional trip to London but for those who frequent London constantly it really is not good enough! On the upside though - so long as I don't think about the breakfast issues - I would stay here again if necessary and heartily recommend the hotel. And the breakfast and lack of service? Well - their continental breakfast is self service so I could opt for that and crash tackle the waiters for fluids as required or even better I will probably, in future, breakfast elsewhere!"
34,618,Oct 7 2006 	Smallest beds in London	Beware of the &quot;queen&quot; size beds that are actually &quot;full&quot; sized beds and not at at all suitable for 2 adults over 5.10&quot;. . At 275 GBP the service is awful. The bar is very ordinary with lackluster service. Only redeeming quality to the place is the location.
35,618,"Sep 26 2006 	consistently excellent	what can I say about The Charlotte Street Hotel? I am almost reluctant to tell everyone how lovely, buzzy, well-located, cozy and well catered it is! We have stayed there 4 times now and from the room service - lovely quality and nice understated service, to the great decor and excellent bar, just cannot fault it. this part of London is a real find with a great little dance club just down the street which plays '80-s music to indie to chart. how can you ask for more? the hotel is pricey but really is worth it. it just has a great atmosphere. it has made for a few memorable stays and has become our 'special place' in London"
36,618,"Aug 15 2006	FAB..where do they find these beds ???	We have the good fortune of being able to travel quite frequently around the world. In late July we booked a large suite at Charlotte Street. I know that the check in time was in the late afternoon, but asked if we could possibly check in early since our flight arrived in the late morning. I was told that they would do their best, but the hotel was fully booked. We arrived around 200p and low and behold..no room, they told me to return around 400p and the room should be ready. Oh well, dropped off the luggage and headed to Central for some shopping and walking off a little lingering jet lag. Returned to the hotel at the appointed time and... no room, there seemed to be a bit of confusion about who had the key and whether housekeeping had actually cleaned the room, about 30min later..viola...the room was ready..hmmmThe room itself was fabulous, bedroom off to the left of the center hall, center bathroom and powder room and to the right a very cosy living room. Like all the Tablet hotels, the bed was amazingly comfortable, I cant describe how comfortable it is, my only wish is they would tell me where to buy one !!!My only real gripe was that the doorman was a little abrupt with my girlfriend making her feel uncomfortable when she arrived. He also didnt help her as she struggled with her luggage getting it out of the taxi.We didnt try out the restaurant, Soho has so many to chose from we explored the neighborhood. We did try the gym which was small but well equipped. Room Service was terrific and the food while a bit pricey, very good.We will return.!"
37,618,Jun 1 2006	Lovely but can't justify its rates	I stayed at the Charlotte St Hotel with my boyfriend after booking one of their sister hotels for 2007 instead of this year! The only room available was at Charlotte St. It was a lovely room (the bathroom was superb) and we couldn't fault the service. However the room rate was ridiculously expensive for what we got and the breakfast was not included and cost us 50 for two! Ideal for American tourists who have money to burn but personally we wouldn't stay there again.
38,618,"May 28 2006 	This is a very nice hotel with great service and location	I turned up from Gatwick after a delayed flight only to be greeted by warm staf and a loevly room with all the 5 star trimmings, food is awesome and lounge area is stylsih  feels like home and every room is different with a great vibe for artists , musos or people who dont like stuffy 5 star try hards....i will return and recoomend it highly ....room servie menu is great &amp; breakfast inc is supreme quality - a bit exy 150 - 300 pounds but hey u r in london and walking ditance form eveything you could wish for....try it i did for 3 nighst instead of one as planned ...."
39,618,Nov 30 2005	A Class Act	This is an understated hotel with extraordinary service. They even have a vegan menu in an excellent kitchen. I will always stay here when i'm in London. It's also a fav with the acting fraternity who visit the lux theatrette in the hotel for advance screenings.
40,618,"Sep 1 2005	All the luxury you need	My husband and I were lucky enough to stay here for our wedding anniversary and were so taken with the room that we dropped our plans of a cinema trip in favour of snuggling up in the fluffy bathrobes and watching one of the DVDs from the hotels' extensive DVD library. Loved every minute of it.Ok so it's a little expensive, but the location is great, the service impeccable and the bed the softest."
41,618,"Jun 30 2005 	Charlotte Street= classy and quaint	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel while he was in London on business. The room was cozy, clean and wonderfully decorated. The staff was very friendly and we loved the lounge area with the cozy fireplace. I would go back to the Charlotte St. Hotel in an instant!"
42,618,"May 30 2005 	Nice hotel in a trendy area	My stay was great rooms clean and cosy, good service, nice library with fireplace to have a drink in. Lot of nice restaurants in the area. Would want to stay here next time as well but it is rather expensive."

1,619,"Sep 15 2009 	Very basic but very clean	I stayed at the Chelsea Guest House as I had an assessment at the Southbank YMCA just down the road. I was a little worried as it is not a very pleasant area at night however it is much bigger than it looks and there were over 20 rooms occupied on the Monday night that I stayed. Although the single room i stayed in was small, it definately did the job. I stayed in a room right at the back so there was very little street noise (room 21) and i had a very comfortable night sleep. The TV only had the basic 5 channels but i wasn't expecting the full Sky package! The bathroom was impeccably clean and the shower was wonderful! The hotel staff were also kind enough to allow me to park my car in their car park for the day while i attended my assessment &quot;as long as it was gone by 5pm&quot; which was more than adequate. Staff were polite although I didn't really have much to do with them. I didn't eat their breakfast as i didn't have time and there was a McDonalds right next door anyway.For the price - this was brilliant."
2,619,"Sep 6 2009 	fine	i booked this as i was travelling to london to see my sister, it is exactly what you see on the internet and for the price we paid i think it was a perfect place to stay nice and close to victoria station.have to say had no problems here it is a bit noisy but what do you expect its central london near the airport!!!!!"
3,619,"Aug 1 2009 	very noisy....	Positive points: The location and a very nice area.Negative points: very very noisy, even if you are not on the front part of the house.On top of heavy traffic, there is also a lot of flights (even during the night) every 2-5mn. The rooms are very bad isolated, and you can hear very easily your neighbourhood.Rooms &amp; bathroom dirty. You have also to wait a long time to have your breakfast (and you have to ask if you want toasts)."
4,619,Jul 29 2009 	Fantastic value for money and very clean	I stayed here for 3 nights and found it to be one of the cleanest hotels/guest houses that I have ever stayed in. The room was a good size with an ensuite bathroom and the location was perfect for travelling into Central London. I believe the photos on the website were a true representation of the actual hotel rooms and would definitely recommend as a good value and clean hotel for coming to stay in London.
5,619,"Apr 26 2009 	Small and not maintained rather pay more for a better guest house	Having checked into the guest house with friends, i was horrified to see how small the rooms were and the state of repair,Lamps were broken, holes on the walls and doors.Maids start hoovering corridors at 7.30am, so not chance of a lie in.Quilts paper thin and everything very dated.What you see on the web site is not what you are getting, would never stay there again!!!!!"
6,619,"Feb 2 2009 	A very pleasant surprise	Having paid only 44 for a double room for a Saturday night, we were not expecting much, but am pleased to say this turned out to be a really good find. Our room was spotlessly clean, as was the bathroom. The bed was comfy and the room of a decent size. The shower was very great - knocking away the cobwebs from the night before.It's not the Ritz but for the price paid it's well worth it if you are looking for a place to lay your head and, like us, only were there to sleep after a night out on the sauce."
7,619,"Oct 14 2008 	Good if you're on a budget!	This hotel is located in Zone 2, south of the Thames. Good to know if you're planning to see the sites and will be relying on public transport, as you'll likely end up paying for a day pass for Zones 1 &amp; 2, which costs 10 GBP a day. The rooms were clean, although the window was broken, and the bathroom is very, very small. Towels provided, and basic TV as well. Walls are very thin, as others have noted, so would definitely recommend ear plugs. We used them, and slept fine. The hotel is in a slightly dodgy area, so would not recommend walking home at night. Buses run from the tube station fairly regularly, and overall, we thought it was good value by London standards, although we probably wouldn't stay here again."
8,619,Aug 29 2008	noisey hotel dodgy area	this a very basic MOTEL not a hotel as that would mean a tv room and dinning area and smilling staff VERY NOISEY WITH PEOPLE SLAMMING DOORS AND WATCHING TV AT ALL HOURS (1am 2am 3am) we were unlucky enough to get room 13 at the old front part of the hotel wich lacks any double glazing the road is very noisey as its one of the MAIN ROADS in south london and low level (200ft) jumbos fly over every 10mins WE ALSO GOT SORE NECKS FROM ONLY HAVING ONE PILLOW??????????????? take my advice dont stay here !! if the polish staff would smile there faces would crack in two AND IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PHOTOS ON THE WEB SITE THATS LIES
9,619,"Jul 12 2008 	if you like sharing your bed this is the place for you!!!	Stayed here for 2 nights in July as working nearby,first impressions wasnt to bad,after all its only somewhere to sleep if your out all day but i draw the line at finding BEDBUGS on the mattress!!!!but what i really found unbelieviable was that the manager/receptionist accused me of bringing them into the hotel!!Needless to say i will be informing the local enviromental health."
10,619,"May 21 2008	Not good	We stayed here four nights, and would have left five minutes after we got there but it was late at night and we had no other place to go. First the positives:It is right on the bus line, and not too far from restaurants.Now the negatives:- The rooms are very small.- The place is noisy, and sounds like a dungeon with the clanking of the doors late at night.- We were lucky and got a room away from the street, but facing the street would be very noisy.- There was no night tables, and the table lamp sat on the floor.- The TV remote did not work and the TV had problems.- The toilet was plugged, and when it was flushed it sounded like a plane taking off.- The bathroom was so small it was hard to turn around in it.- The bedroom was small, with about a foot between tthe two small twin beds. - The chest of drawers was falling apart.- The rate was 59 pounds a night.-It is nothing like the room that they describe on their web page."
11,619,"Oct 23 2007 	Basic Bed in London	I stayed at the Chelsea Guest House for 3 nights. My initial impression of the area was dubious as the railway station is quite lonely, however this improved once I got my bearings). The guest house is cheap - no frills - but I had a comfortable double bed and clean ensuite shower. They do not provide breakfast but there are a number of places in the immediate vicinity where you can get some, although I did not do this.Ask for a room at the back of the building as the guest house is on a busy road and the traffic noise early in the morning is quite bad."
12,619,Oct 16 2008 	Un po lontanoma a buon prezzo!
13,619,Oct 5 2008 	????????????
14,619,Sep 23 2008 	Ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo
1,620,Jun 18 2008 	Dirty and Loud	My husband and I booked the Chelsea Lodge because it was on Arthur Frommer's recommendations and we were thoroughly dissapointed. We didn't mind that the rooms were small but we did mind that it was very filthy. There were curry stains on the wall
2,620,May 1 2008 	A solid deal...	I read about this property on BudgetTravel.com
3,620,Aug 8 2007 	The Absolute Worst Hotel Ever	After a 7 hour transatlantic flight
4,620,May 13 2007	Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in	Rooms where extremely dirty. Didn't look like they had a good clean in years. I was afraid to get into the shower as it was so discoloured. Bed had no springs
5,620,Mar 25 2007 	Dirty and Rude	My mother and I booked in here having read the reviews on TripAdvisore for seeing the Chelsea Flower Show in 2006. When we arrived we were led up a filthy stairs which smelled of smoke
6,620,Aug 3 2005	Still a good choice	As we stayed here two years ago and I was pleased with it at the time we decided to stay here again for another weekend. The hotel is still a good option if you're on a budget. The pub has gone and been replaced by a french bistro. The place still offers value for money. There are 3 buses stopping just outside the hotel and you're near Harrods within 15 minutes.	
7,620,Apr 5 2005	Value for money	We stayed here during Wimbledon two years ago and for what you pay for it you get great value. Prices include (simple) breakfast served in the pub downstairs. The pub can cause some noise on weekends.Taking the buss (there's a stop just outside the hotel) to the city centre takes about 15 minutes
8,620,Nov 3 2004	Clean + Affordable = 2 Content College Students	I was visiting London on short notice and most of the hotels that I found for good prices received terrible reviews on this website
9,620,Nov 3 2009 	Saleté et moisissure		
10,620,Sep 19 2009 	Für Sightseeing Perfekt!		
1,632,Nov 18 2009 	Good value	I staid for a week and was satisfied. The price is very good but remember that room service is extra (..for a studio apt is cost 15 pounds extra/day).
2,632,"Nov 18 2009	Amazingly good value	Stayed here for the night after a day of shopping / sightseeing/ drinking and watching Priscilla Queen of the dessert for the 4th time just love it, rather than rushing to get the train home. We were pleasantly surpirsed at how good it was for the price we paid. Now if you think about Super 8 in USA and Best Western you are not far from these, (apart form complimentary brreakfasts in USA) Situated on Northumberland Avenue, 2 minutes from Le Cage Aux Folle, River Thames, Embankment bridge/station, and close to the Sherlock Holmes pub. At the end of the road you hav eTrafalgar Square and a Tesco xpress good for grabbing a snack on the way back.Lobby area really plush but rest of areas are serviceable . The room a twin on the Mezzanine floor had 2 single beds, small flat screen TV, kitchen with dishwasher, microwave, fridge, hob and enough items to keep you going for the overnight stay, as did the bathroom. there is also a safe which was welcome!We did not sample anything here just used it to sleep but seemed to be ok for a base if you are not spending hours in your room, but why would you want to do that anyway when you are on holiday with lots of things to see. Yes we would go back it was great for what we needed."
3,632,"Nov 9 2009 	Location location	For visiting London, I have not found a better place to stay because it is 3 minutes to Trafalgar Square, 3 minutes to the Embankment underground station, 12 minutes to waterloo, 7 minutes to the theatre district, 10 to Covent Garden and surrounded by pubs and restaurants. The apartments have kitchens for breakfasts or late night snacks.BUT with the exception of the lobby, the building (corridors and units) are very basic and quite graceless.YET when we next go to London, we will try to stay there. At under $300 a night for a one bedroom unit, it is cheaper and yet more flexible than hotels in the same part of this great city."
4,632,"Nov 9 2009 	Great Location Old guest house fittings	Great location with well signed entrance and good looking lobby with one laptop giving free internet .Breakfast available.Rooms have dated furniture, old carpet to the floor with dirty curtains and dingy lighting.The value is in the opportunity to have mutli room price tarif which offers a kitchenette.We had a three room penthouse Hahah. Please do not book one of these if you have ltd mobility. There is a very dangerous spiral staircase and the shower room is tiny &amp; unable to open the door fully, and there is just one toilet which is downstairs(both bedrooms upstairs). The beds are made with crisp fresh bedding and we were provided with lots of clean towels.The beds were comfortable.The carpet really is not nice and I would recomend bringing house shoes or slippers.They do provide welcome bathroom pack and tea making pack and there is plenty of hot water .Plus a tesco express at the end of the street.I think this is why the reviews vary so much. The essentials are covered very well, but only if you can ignore some tatty environment and safety issues with those stairs.We would use it again , we've got 4 children and London is really expensive for us when we stay over but I wouldn't recomend friends to stay, as I think most would be very peturbed by the tired furnsihings, almost unhygeinic flooring and tiny bathroom.A good location for families or for extended stays using the kitchenette but do not expect any element of luxury."
5,632,"Oct 18 2009 	Location brilliant rooms a little jaded	A group of 3 of us stayed here in a 2 bed apartment for a long weekend at the beginning of October. The hotel has 2 major advantages namely LOCATION and (less so) value. It makes a trip to London so easy when you can walk.......to the river, Tate Modern, National Gallery , St Martin in the Fields, Covent Garden, the Eye, Westminster. It's especially nice to be so near the river. The front of house staff are fine, the beds and shower were fine, the luggage service was very easy when we left our luggage for a few hours after check out - what would make me hesitate to recommend the hotel is the jaded feel, eg the carpets in the corridors upstairs, the sofa was a bit tired, the toilet was a little on the odorous side. Also, the ceilings in the narrow corridors were low. The windows were in peculiar places in the bedrooms because of the way the interior of the building has been refitted. This might not apply to all rooms as ours was a duplex, with an internal stairs from the living area to the bedroom area. On balance, if the accommodation aspect of a break isn't the major criterion, then the location of this hotel outweighs any other factor."
6,632,"Oct 18 2009 	Good value for Central London	My husband and I only stayed here overnight for a theatre trip, but it would be very useful as a base for a longer stay, being in the middle of things. The room was functional and fairly no-frills (although there was a new LCD TV with Freeview channels, which we didn't use!), but the beds were comfortable (we had expected a double but got two singles) and the little kitchen would be very handy if you were staying longer. The room was a good size too, although the bathroom layout wasn't the best use of the space. The room was clean and modern enough. Staff at reception were ok but not especially friendly; we had no contact with other staff. Our overall impression was very good for the price in Central London, but don't expect too much."
7,632,"Oct 5 2009 	Better than expected... value for money in everyway! Loved Citadines!	On the weekend October 2nd to October 4th we (3 adults) decided to spend a weekend in London We booked in Citadines Hotel at a rate of 271 Euros (2 nights, 4 adults max) After reading the reviews, we were not really sure what to expect the final result, as you will see, was surprisingly positive! First of all, the location! The location cant be beaten! Right in the middle of everything, still in a very quiet street its like 2 minute walk from Charing Cross or Embarkment Metro Station the London eye is like 5 minutes away and so on the rest of the tourist attractions The commuting from Gatwick Express was like a breeze, going ton Gatwick to Victoria and then to Embarkment in like 45 minutes . Within 2 blocks there are plenty of supermarkets, small shops, bars, pubs, clubs, restaurants, etc Then, our room was ready upon early arrival (1030 am!) the room (820) was on the eight floor the size was perfect by all means!!! Bathroom and separate shower then a separate double room and then a quite big living room with one sofa (that converted into 2 separate twin beds), a big desk and a flat tv besides, a small kitchen the dcor was modern and practical, nothing fancy but not cold either the shower had plenty of hot water and nice pressure our room at night was not noisy at all!The place was not small at all and everything worked perfectly it was even bigger than many English flats!The convertible sofa was great because it turned into 2 separate beds, so you can place then in a 90 degrees angle the beds, sheets and pillows were comfortable everything was clean and in perfect shape The service in the front desk was practical and efficient in everyway there is free wifi in the lobby and a computer with internet free to use Upon checkout, we stored our stuff in the luggage room, as did mostly the rest of the guest, and indeed they make you sign a form that they are not responsible for your goods as it happens in every other hotel, its just that they explicitly admit it no problem at the end when claiming our bagsIn general, we were extremely happy with our choice I really believe that Citadines offers true value for your money, since in such an expensive city like London is difficult to find roomy and fairly priced accommodations. I would definitely recommend this to all my fellow travelers."
8,632,"Sep 27 2009 	Excellent Location and Value for Central London	Will try and make this as short/brief as I can as there is much to say about our recent stay at The Citadines Apart 'hotel in London Trafalgar Square.Our family (myself; my wife; and 2 teenage kids ages 16 and 18) planned our trip to London at the VERY LAST MINUTE - literally 4-5 days b4 leaving - obviously not what you normally would want to do. Especially not at the &quot;high season&quot; for tourism in London. Thus, our choices for hotels were very limited at that time. After hours and hours of searching, I stumbled upon a room/suite at The Citadines Apart 'hotel near Trafalgar Square. Had never heard of the place and wasn't overly familiar with the entire Trafalgar Square area. Having said that, the daily room price - $250 (US) was reasonable given the ridiculous prices I was being quote elsewhere and other reviews on Trip Advisor were positive overall so we took a chance and booked a room for the week we were staying (Aug 8-16th). In a nutshell, WE WERE VERY GLAD WE MADE THIS CHOICE. Let me address the 2 primary issues to be considered here - the Location and the hotel itself:1. as others have said, it's all about LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. I can't imagine there being a place to stay in central London that would be more convenient than The Citadines. You are literally within 10 minutes or less walking distance to many of the major attractions:-Trafalgar Square and National Gallery (3 minutes away) - major people watching!-Big Ben (8-10 minutes)-Westminster Abbey (8-10 minutes)-Theatre District (10 minutes)-The &quot;London Eye&quot; (5 minutes)-Thames River (5 minutes)-10 Downing St (6-8 minutes)-Covent Garden (10+ minutes)-Piccadilly Circus (maybe 15 minutes; over rated btw)-Regent Street (10 minutes)In fact, Buckingham Palace was only a 20 minute walk if we had chosen to go that route. The British Museum and Library about the same distance. And walking in London can be fun. Tons to see; surprises around every corner if you watch closely; and lots of people watching. Other conveniences close by would include:-a tube and major rail station immediately around the corner (Charing Cross)-several mini-markets within 2-3 minutes walking (which we used A LOT)-a number of American fast food places (Subway; McDonalds; Burger King; Pizza Hut) for those with fussy teenage eaters also within 5 minutes or so. You get the picture. Everthing was very convenient for our traveling needs. And the area itself - particularly Trafalgar Square - feels very much like what you would expect London to feel like. You can just feel the history oozing out of this area. 2. The hotel and room itself - while not a 5 star world class accomodation - was more than acceptable for our families needs. Specifically:-Our suite (#418) consisted of a main living room with a couch bed and pull out bed and a side bedroom with a queen bed (note: and a fair amount of closet space). The rooms were not huge by any means but certainly not as tiny as some on the 'Net would have you believe and certainly &quot;livable&quot; in that regard. To be precise (yes I measured), the main room was approximately 10' x 15'; the side room was approximate 10' x 10'. Add to that a separate bathroom; separate toilet; kitchen area and a main hallway and it feels like you are living in a small apartment. Which is exactly what this place is advertised as.-The rooms were clean and functional. The Beds were comfortable and that's saying something as both my son and I are over 6 feet tall. And just as importantly, our room faced the back of the hotel (vs the main street which was faily busy) and we heard absolutely no noise at night whatsoever. Very quiet.-The Bathroom - while not huge - was more than sufficient. Very nice shower stall and tons of hot water and pressure which I know is an issue in many European hotels. Towels were sufficient and comfortable. Hair dryer worked fine. (Important to note here: they only change the towels and sheets once a week here if you're staying that long; you can pay to have it done daily (about 15 pounds) but we chose to tough it out).-the modest kitchen with microwave, toaster; 'frig; utencils; etc. was extremely useful for our family - allowed us to save big $ on meals which can be very pricey in London. The only thing not provided (which you can get nearby) was paper towels. Do not underestimate the importance of having an in-room kitchen - especially if you have kids and/or teenagers. Was a major benefit to our stay at this hotel. -almost as important as the room itself, was our ability to connect to the Internet (hey - we have teenagers and the thought of being away from Facebook for more than a day was almost more than they could handle). In that regard, our room was a 10+ as the WiFi connection worked every single time with no problems at all. I was actually stunned that we were able to access the Web so easily as I had read the horror stories from others. No such problem with our room. And the speed was very acceptable.-the flat screen TV in our room - while not huge by any means (about 19 inches or so) was (again) acceptable for our needs. The reality is that your choices in London are fairly limited for TV viewing - especially if you are an American who is used to 300-400 channels on Direct TV or the Dish. And we weren't in London to watch TV so the amount of time we spent in front of the tube (no pun intended) was fairly limited.-the A/C in the room worked fantastic - almost too good - as it could actually get a bit chilly at night if we left it on. Again, I've read stories of other hotels where rooms were stuffy and hot - no such problem with our room. Very comfortable at night.-lastly, there was a trash &quot;shute&quot; (common in European hotels) immediately outside our door. Very convenient. A couple of other things to mention:There is a computer and Internet availability in the main lobby - I used this a lot (at 4-5 am) when the family was sleeping and I was answering email and writing folks at home. Connection was actually slower than the WiFi in my room. But it's available if you choose not to bring a laptop with you. The front staff - while nice and professional enough - were not overly attentive and/or seemingly concerned to the few issues I had to bring to their attention but everything got resolved in due time - albeit with a bit of pressure applied on my end. I would rate them about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10. I would give the in house maintenance guy a 10 for the one time I had to call for his help as he was there within seconds. We (unfortunately) cannot speak to the breakfast accomodations at the hotel as we did not eat a single meal there. The room is directly off the main lobby and was nice enough. However we rarely saw more than a few people in it. The price of the breakfast - 10 pounds - may or may not have had something to do with it. We choose to stay in our room and prepare our own means given we had a kitchen. Saved lots of $.-There is a very nice looking pub - &quot;The Sherlock Holmes&quot; directly adjacent to the hotel. It's literally within 90 secons of the front door. So there's another food option. -There is also a very nice Italian restaurant also wthin 1-2 minutes of the hotel. We ate there our last night in London. Food wasn't anything to write home about - good but not great - but it's an extremely nice place if you want to go out for a dinner that won't break the bank. Kind of like an upscale CA Pizza Kitchen. OK. . . . .hopefully I've provided you with a good snapshot of this hotel. Bottom line is that we would have no qualms at all about staying there again - and our teenage kids enjoyed it as well for what that's worth. On a scale of 1-10:Location is a 10+Hotel is a solid 8-9 (assuming you have reasonable expectations)Hope that this input is useful for any of you out there looking to visit the central London area. We had a great family trip and this hotel was a critical and positive piece of that experience!"
9,632,Sep 23 2009 	Great location	We choose to stay at citadines trafalgar square having previously sayed at citadines accommodation in Paris. We were not let down. The rooms are basic but clean and the little kitchen is very handy. We didn't get the warmest welcome on arrival from the receptionist but the service we received was much better from other members of staff. The location was fantastic - Embankment tube station only a couple of mins away and there were plenty of ameneties close by.
10,632,"Sep 19 2009 	Keep away from this hotel - you things are not safety and may be stolen !	We were very disappointed by this hotel. Our laptop computer was stolen from the luggage room of the hotel. The hotel stuff and management made them not relevant for this accident and behaved as if it is some negligible youth-hostel, and not the member of the world-wide hotels network. We never met such relation to the customers before!So don't be misled by the visible things - the very central location, reasonable price versus value etc. - in the end you are not safety in this hotel. You things may be stolen and nobody will take responsibility on your troubles."
11,632,"Sep 15 2009 	Great Location but Accomodation could be improved	A group of five of us stayed at the Citadenes Hotel Trafalgar square for 4 nights in August 2009. The location is fantastic, a few minutes from Trafalgar Square, the Covent Garden, the London Eye and all main London attractions etc.Two of our group shared a studio apartment for two adults and three of us had a one bedroom apartment for three (two adults and one teenager).The studio apartment for two adults had a bathroom (small and very high sided three quarter length bath/shower to get into), a well appointed separate kitchen, and a main living room lounge with pull out sofa bed for two. The one bedroom apartment however, had a bathroom (same small bath/shower with high side to climb over and into), a separate bedroom with double bed, and a living area with sofa /pull-out bed. There was no kitchen in this apartment, when opening what looked like wardrobe doors in the main living area, there was found a kitchen area. The master electricity switch for this kitchen area was behind the pull out doors and was initially overlooked being hard to find. The kitchen units were clean but shabby with chipped edges. The cleanliness in the bathroom was much to be desired, human hair on the tiles and mirror as though an old rag had been used to wipe over, (possibly a previous occupants bath towel). Also, this room overlooked the back of the hotel and was quite noisy at nightime. The studio apartment, very clean kitchen and bathroom, had a front of hotel room view overlooking Northumberland Avenue, this was a much nicer apartment. We did not however have time to keep putting the sofa bed up and down, so left it up, so may as well have been staying in a normal double hotel bedroom with a real bed as opposed to a pull down sofa bed. The first night, my alarm clock fell under the bed, and I found a load of broken glass underneath the sofa bed itself while trying to retrieve it.When I booked these two apartments several months in advance, I knew I was booking rooms with sofa beds and kitchen facilities so that savings could be made on eating breakfasts etc., however, it was not immediately clear that rooms are not cleaned unless requested and paid for as an extra. Beds are not made, bedding not changed, towels not changed and rubbish is not removed. This is acceptable for a one or two night stay. But, after four days, we would have appreciated at least our rubbish bins emptied.Another thing to mention. On early arrival at this hotel, our room was not ready, ok we knew it would not be ready, we were early. The reception staff greeted us warmly and told us we could leave our luggage securely with them in a locked and secure area behind reception, and we were pleased and grateful for this. However  on vacating our rooms on the day of departure, we needed to leave our luggage for a few hours that morning before our transfers arrived to collect us. We were told that there we would have to sign a responsibility waiver form as our belongings could only be left in two left luggage rooms where the keys are given freely to anyone seemingly using this facility. This was actually quite alarming. There are two small damp cupboard rooms where luggage can be left, but the keys to both rooms are given to anyone requesting them. Both rooms had broken locks with handles which came off when opening and closing the doors. It was a case of you are no longer residents here; its up entirely up to you if you risk leaving your belongings here because we dont care now you are going! Very disappointing after having spent a large amount of money staying at this hotel.The price we paid, being the height of season was not cheap. It is about the same as a hotel room which includes room service (rooms cleaned, beds made etc). The advantage is that you have kitchen and fridge facilities. I would stay here again - as I now know what to expect, and as mentioned, the location is fantastic for London and sightseeing."
12,632,"Sep 15 2009 	disappointing	Very small, cold and noisy room. Honestly with there are many cheaper and better places in London."
13,632,Sep 14 2009 	perfect	It had a great location. staff were friendley and rooms were clean. had a great time in London a lot of attractions were in walking distance.The bus tour was good got to see a lot more than we would of by tube.Was worried about getting to hotel from Heathrow but found a great taxi company{london Executive Chauffeurs} were there on time and good price. Took us door to door. Worth trying this hotel if you want somewhere central.
14,632,"Sep 6 2009 	Fabulous location good price adequate accomodations	Location, location, location! Right down the block from Trafalgar Square, walked to the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, National Gallery, St James Park. We also walked to Westminister Abbey, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, but it was tiring. Right around the corner from Charing Cross station. We were a group of 6 - 2 adults, 2 kids (age 9 and 3) in a 1 bedroom and 1 adult one 7 year old in a studion. The 1 bedroom was small by American standards and if my kids were older it would have felt smaller. The bedroom fit the bed and you could maneuver around it, but barely - weird closet - clothes hung from fron to back instead of side to side so it was only about 6 inches deep. No dressers, one big closet with deep shelves that fit all of our clothing (it was summer, so no bulky items). Separate room for toilet and shower, a plus as one person could shower and other could use the toilet. Kids slept on trundle bed in living room - two twin mattresses. Little kitchette with one burner and microwave, small fridge, sink, dishwasher and dishes included. We didn't cook but did cereal and packed sandwiches - saved a bunch of $$. My mother and daughter were in a studio - they shared a pull out couch. Not ideal, but better than paying more or staying further away. Also, as a caveat, we are a pretty petite family, but we thought that if we were taller or heavier the rooms would have been much more uncomfortible - a tight sqeeze in the toilet room and shower and definately bumping into each other in the living area. Room was clean but worn, some bleach stains on the carpet (fine with me, meant they tried to clean something!) Front desk staff indifferent but not rude. Biggest complaint - the laundry facilities were a RIPOFF!!!! 7 pounds (about $14!!! ) for ONE token! I just washed stuff out in the sink - there was a drying rack in the shower. Bottom line, I would stay there again for the convenient location and the cost savings from eating in the room for 2 meals a day."
15,632,Sep 3 2009	WOW	I loved this hotel. It's close to everything. There's 2 subway stations at a 2 minute walk. Buses at the door. Train station close by. Great museum at a walking distance. The Thames down the street. I had a blast. The staff was very nice and helpfull. The room were small by our standard and a bit old in dcor but everything was clean. Since you mostly use the room to sleep its was perfect.
16,632,"Aug 25 2009 	Room is TINY	The room was TINY. The fridge was broken and we could only store a few things. It is far away from a decent supermarket. The dishwasher was literally smaller than a hand-luggage. One receptionist was very cold and rude. The view was HORRIBLE since the windows were never cleaned and were covered in soot. We only had 2 forks, 2 knives, 2 plates etc, which made the stay very uncomfortable."
17,632,"Aug 9 2009 	The Heart of London	A fantasticly comfortable no frills hotel in the very Heart of London. Quiet and superbly situated and FANTASTIC value for money . If you just need somewher to sleep , shower and rest a bit this is the place to stay."
18,632,"Jul 30 2009 	Great location; Good rate for London	Stayed 1 night here. Easy to find. Fantastic location: 1 min walk to Embankment &amp; Charing Cross Tube stations; 1 min walk to Trafalgar Square; 3 min walk to Covent Garden.Not a great start checking in as we requested twin beds and got a double. Easily fixed moved rooms but then swipe card didn't work! Further trek downstairs but then fixed.Rooms were average: good size, small flat screen TV, kitchen (incl fridge and oven) and bathroom clean and good size.Plenty of eateries around and convenience shops (Tesco Express 1 min walk) to stock up on water, breakfast, dinner etc.The location sells this hotel. Will definitely stay here again. Not sure why they dont charge more!"
19,632,"Jul 21 2009 	Location!	I have to repeat what many have said before; the location of this hotel cannot be beaten if you are visiting London for sightseeing. Trafalgar Square is a 2 minute walk from the hotel, Big Ben 5 minutes. Most London attractions are within walking distance (we are walkers).The rooms are what we expected from a 3 star hotel. They are fairly spacious (for London) and clean but pretty worn. Internet (wired) is free in the rooms which was a nice surprise. The room gets cleaned once a week so if you are there for less than a week your room will not get cleaned and your garbage will not get removed. You should collect your garbage in a bag and get rid of it yourself since it does add up and there isn't enough space to leave it in the room.Overall, the hotel is an excellent value for the location it has and I would stay there again when visiting London."
20,632,"Jul 19 2009 	avoid this hotel	We did not like this hotel at all. Came for one overnight. Had pullout bed which we did not expect. Little furniture with no dresser only a closet for clothes. Carpet was dirty and I didn't want to walk on it with barefeet. Ugly decorating, view of the heating vents outside, high price. Changed rooms, hotel wanted upgrade fee for 2 single beds. Only one computer in lobby, with people waiting at your side for their turn. Paid 17 L ($30 Can) for 3 short local phone calls!!! Breakfast was 10L. Staff seemed inexperienced.Only the location was good, just down the street from Trafalgar Sq., close to Charing Cross stn."
21,632,"Jul 19 2009 	Location is the key	Yes, the location is the best thing about this hotel, it's within walking distance to the London Eye, Trafalgar Square and Westminster Abbey. also it's right down the block from the local tube station. The rooms were clean though small. The kitchen was well stocked with just about anything you might need to make your own meals. I would stay there again and will recommend it to friends and family. We did not choose to have breakfast in their dining room but did make our own in the room. Also internet was available in the room."
22,632,"Jul 7 2009 	Highly recommended	Stayed there for 2 nights June/July 2009 on business. Excellent location in central London, brilliant access to Tube. Room was very clean, including the bathroom and kitchenette. Sofabed was reasonably comfortable. Staff a bit surly it has to be said. M&amp;S Simply Food 2 mins walk away at Charing Cross if you need to stock up. Would definitely use for business/holiday again."
23,632,"Jul 3 2009 	Great location and great kitchen	A few minutes walk to Trafalgar Square and the undergroud. Near the Thames och London Eye. Rather small room but great kitchen with microowen, stove and fridge. Twinbed and tv. Free internet in lobby. Skip the breakfast at the hotel."
24,632,"Jul 1 2009 	Excellent Hotel	This hotel was everything we were expecting. It was within walking distance from a majority of London sights (Trafalgar square, the London eye etc), of 2 tube station and a train station. We arrived early and our room was not ready, but the reception staff provide a space were we could leave our luggage so that we could start visiting London.I have to admit that the decor was a bit dated but clean, the washroom was adequate and we never ran out of hot watter. The kitchennette was all that was required, but you have the bare minimum (would be usefull to have more than 2 water glasses).We were situated accross the elevators and I thought it would be noisy, but our room was very quiet. Eventhough the hotel is situated on a very busy street we did not hear a thing.We stayed at that hotel for 7 nights and I would stay there again."
25,632,"Jun 18 2009 	Enjoyed our stay !	I had read the reviews and felt slight panic ! The check in was very smooth and the staff very friendly, we on went to our bedroom still expecting problems and to be honest for the 100 we paid for a double room we were very impressed. Very clean throughout, one room was the kitchette which had everything you would need. The bathroom was great , plenty of hot water and nice deep bath with shower above ( needed after shopping all day ). I honestly can not fault the Citadine the location is totally fab and they have a luggage room so you can leave your luggage on your last day free to carry on shopping. We had room 304 and maybe some of the rooms need updating but we were more than happy with our room and to be honest we have paid alot more and had worse hotels in London . It was very warm that day so we did need to leave the hotel window open that night and yes we could hear street noise but then what do you expected when you stay in central London? I suggest ear plugs work great for me !Def stay again ."
26,632,"Jun 15 2009 	A little tired but the LOCATION makes up for it!!	Having visited London on many occasions for leisure, I must say that the location of the Citadines, Trafalgar is second to none.Taxi cost 8.00 from Euston Station. The embankment pier for the thames clipper is a couple of hundred yards to the left, trafalgar square a couple of hudred yards to the right. Travelling with two teenage children, the citadine apartment layout ideal i.e decent sized double bedroom, ample kitchen with dishwaher, bathroom, wc, living room with television(freeview chanels) cd player, table and chairs and a large settee which doubles as two good sized single beds. One negative point is that the carpets and decor are a little tired and need updating but this is outweighed again by the space in the 'apartment' (in central London!!). It was also very clean.Just on the corner of Trafalgar is a little 24hr tesco shop so we stocked up the fridge fairly cheaply with fresh baguettes, ham etc. London can be very expensive with two burly teenagers constantly starving!! Also for a hearty low cost breakfast there's a Garfuncles opposite and best of all....next door to the citadines is the 'Sherlock Holmes Pub' with very reasonably priced traditional meals and great beer (have a look on the net!).On this occasion we visited London to attend a late night concert at the O2. I pre-booked tickets on the Thames Clipper Express from Waterloo to the QE2 (O2)and of course back again. The Waterloo stop is just over the *jubilee*bridge?? which also has pedestrian crossing again only a few hundred yards(&amp; lots of others going the same way) Honestly, could not have been simpler.If it is a romantic break you are after, then this is NOT for you but if your sightseeing with family or with friends visiting shows or O2, I dont think you'll be disappointed here."
27,632,"Jun 6 2009 	Tired and In Need of an Update	I arrived after a long trip from Hong Kong. The room was tired, with a stained carpet and faded decor. At the back of the hotel, the room was noisy and the single glazing let through all the noise of the sirens, tourists going home from the pubs and the late night/early morning drunks.The bed (a pull out double from the room settee) was comfortable, but poorly positioned light switches and protruding metal from the bed ensured a few muffled swear words on the way to a bathroom stop in the dark.This properties rooms are very tired. It needs a refurb. The best efforts of the cleaning satff will never make it look clean in current circumstances.On the positive side, the location is OK, though i was surprised at the poor level of street lighting in Northumberland Avenue where the hotel is located."
28,632,"Jun 1 2009	Would not stay here again!	The location of the hotel is fantastic with most things you want to see in London in walking distance. However, the standard of the hotel falls far below expectations.The studio we stayed in was clean overall, but everything was worn and had seen better days. But, when we went to make a cup of tea the kettle had stagnated water with mould growing in it.After calling reception, it took half an hour for somone to come and look at it and replace the kettle. We also spoke to a girl on reception desk about this after coming back from seeing a play. She was less than helpful and had a 'what do you want me to do about it' attitude.We were quite frankly disgusted and would not recommend this place to anyone."
29,632,"May 22 2009 	Location LocationLocation.	Stayed 5 nights on the advice of friends (and recent reviews here).Rented a one bedroom apartment. Room clean,great little kitchenette,near to shopping for food. Walk to many attractions, or subway stop just around the corner (with connections to major routes.)Front desk staff are multilingual, very helpful with directions, limo to airport, etc.On arrival our microwave was not working well, it was replaced immediately.Nothing frilly here but a super location for us...we went all day and half the night, great comfortable king bed at the end of the day.! Breakfast buffet in lobby each a.m. good selection of food, coffee,fruit.Internet available in Lobby.We would definitely return."
30,632,"May 14 2009 	pretty awful place great location	The Citadines was a GREAT disappointment as it was a worn out, old place with no graces!!! great location however so I may end staying there again bec ause the location is unbeatable.Expensive for what it was!"
31,632,"May 5 2009 	I'd happily stay again in fact i've already booked!	Ok, this isn't the best hotel in London but you could do A LOT worse. I'm guessing the poor reviews are by guests that have paid the rack rate or are not used to London prices because i think this hotel is excellent value for money. We paid 75 a night and at that price i'm more than happy with the Citadines.The location is excellent, just off Trafalgar Square, theatre district, Covent Garden, etc all within easy walking distance. We were visiting Heaven nightclub that evening and the hotel is not even 5 minutes walk away.The room facilities were actually very good - a fairly recently refitted bathroom with basic toiletries, an ok sized wardrobe with iron, ironing board and safe, a kitchen with all you'd need if you were self catering (even a dishwasher), lounge with sofa, dining table, flat screen tv, music centre and good lighting. There was also a/c but we didn't need this so can't comment on how effective it is. Yes the rooms are dated and the blankets on the sofabeds have seen better days but i'd say our room was clean and functional and at the rate we paid i was't expecting the Ritz."
32,632,"Feb 14 2009 	The Studios really provide a fold out bed!	Staff were very friendly at the hotel, and allowed me to check in really early (about 9am), without any problem or challenge. I had booked a studio room, which was clean and simple, but the bed was a folding sofa. Not ideal but not the worst sofa I have slept on. Bathroom was ok, and a little kitchen was included. No cable was available, but a range of &quot;Freeview&quot; Channels were."
33,632,"Jan 30 2009 	Rooms need renovating	My husband and I together with two teenage children stayed at the Citadines between Christmas and New Years. Reception staff were helpful and friendly and the location is superb.Reception area looks modern and clean but unfortunately the rooms do not reflect this. Ours was quite shabby, old and dark. Fortunately we did not spend too much time inside! Beds were not too comfortable either and cupboard space was lacking.Perfect location for New Year's Eve celebrations. Will stay again only if renovated. Also stayed at Citadines St Germain des Pres in Paris which was in contrast clean, modern and inviting."
34,632,"Jan 4 2009 	good location	booked the hotel with river cruise company as a package for new years eve, group of 8 of us so 4 double rooms,check in was spot on all rooms ready,1 room had a dirty toilet, i mean dirty not just not flushed, asked at reception and was allsorted on our return 2 hours later,another room mine i may add, had no facility to pop up the plug in wash basin, and the shower did not work at all, so not only no shower no bath either.. i mentioned this at reception but was never sorted, good job we had showered prior to arriving and was leaving first thing in morning. no apologies thou.other 2 rooms were fine.apart from the 2 rooms, the hotel is in great location. and yes i would use again for a short stay only thou."
35,632,"Jan 3 2009 	Amazing Stay	We stayed at this hotel on New Years Eve with our two sons aged 9 and 7. We were very wary of the reviews that we had read on here however the hotel totally exceeded our expectations. We booked a Duplex 2 bedroom apartment and we were most surprised by the amount of room we had. The living room was lovely, the kitchen was great, the bedrooms were huge and we had the best time.The staff at the Citadines were very helpful and attentive, they allowed us to leave the luggage at the hotel whilst we spent New Years Day at the Parade in London.This hotel is a really lovely place to stay and is so close to the London Eye and stations for New Year. We have already rebooked for next year !!!!!!"
36,632,"Jan 3 2009 	better than i expected ...	my travel agent hooked me up with this place. i admit that i was a skeptic--the whole sofabed thing put me off but i also knew that accommodation in london was very hit-or-miss unless you paid a fortune.i'm glad to report that my skepticism was unfounded--the sofabed was actually comfortable (they usually have a lump in the middle but these seem to have that problem licked) . my apartment had the main room (which featured the sofabed, tables along both sides of the sofa, a coffee table, an upholstered chair, a desk (from which i used the free wired internet, which always worked well), a tv stand with a tv with tons of channels (important since i was there for the u.s. election day and wanted to watch the election coverage). There was also a full bathroom and a kitchenette (emphasis on the &quot;ette&quot; part--the floor space occupied by the kitchenette was about 2 sq m). kitchenette was more than adequate for my needs (microwaved foods from the tesco down the street or the m&amp;s around the corner, and refrigerator to store cold foods and insulin). bathroom had a shower inside the bathtub and it all worked well.hotel staff were very helpful ... apartments rented weekly don't get daily housekeeping or linen/towel changes, but you can swap out towels for five pounds which i did after a few days. the big win here, of course, is location. it's footsteps from trafalgar square, about as many footsteps in the other direction to the millennium bridge ... so much is within walking distance!i'm going back to london in the spring and i definitely plan to see if this place has room for me then."
37,632,"Dec 20 2008 	Excellent location reasonable room	Helpful and welcoming on the front desk.Room 216 was quiet, reasonably clean and had a small functional kitchen.Under 10 minutes to Covent Garden, the Eye or the Houses of Parliament.Under 5 minutes to the National GalleryTesco at the Trafalgar Square end of the road."
38,632,"Dec 4 2008 	Great location - but rooms like a hostel	I booked a twin studio at this hotel for my elderly parents to spend some quality time in London. While the location is excellent the rooms are awful: drab, tired, charmless, scuffed, stained, old net curtains, orange/green decor, fusty-smelling bathroom. Think Travelodge and then take it down two levels. I was so embarrassed. To be fair, after I angrily rejected the first two rooms that mum and dad were allocated, the duty manager upgraded them to a better room - but even if I'd seen that one before I made the reservation I would not have gone ahead with the booking.The photo of a bedroom shown on the Citadines website looks excellent. This might be their best room but I can assure you it bears no resemblance to anything we were shown. More honesty please. If you're looking for something utterly basic to sleep in for just a night or two, then maybe ok. But a treat it is not.Reservation warning No1: If you select Studio Double on the Citadines online booking system, it will tell you clearly that you're getting a sofa-bed. However, the Studio Twin says &quot;twin beds&quot; which is why I went for this option. I didn't want parents - both nearer 80 than 70 - having to begin their mini-break by wrestling with furniture. In fact the Studio Twin is also a sofa-bed arrangement, which the second bed sliding out from under the first. It would have been far too low for either of my parents to get in and out of comfortably.Reservation warning No2: The price shown in bold does not include VAT (sales tax) - I missed the asterisks that advised me 17.5% (now 15%) would be added. It meant the price for a boxy studio with a view of the grumbling air-conditioning unit, was 135, excluding breakfast.By chance, a friend was also in London that week, staying across town at the gorgeous Knightsbridge Hotel, part of the Firmdale group. She was paying 185 a night, and for the extra 50 she was getting 10 times the quality."
39,632,Nov 20 2008 	Great Location Worth Staying Here	This was the 4th occasion I stayed at this hotel as I was attending a conference at the nearby Horseguards Parade Thistle Hotel. The staff have actually gotten better. They're pretty helpful and polite and really try hard to accomodate your needs.The location is great! The hotel is close to the West End and London shopping. The furnishings are old and dusty however and could do with some refurbishing. I did notice however that they were re-carpeting this year.Too bad I wont be in London next January though. I'll miss the hotel!
40,632,"Nov 14 2008 	Convenience Location but lacking in local favour	We stayed at hotel for 8 nights. We had one room cleaning and linen cleaning during our stay. The clean day was decide by us.It ws a very conveience location with two subway stop and a rail station within 5 minute walk. It is about 5 mintue walk to the Thames River and a walking bridge to the south side. It is a very commerical area. I feel the area lack local favour. My favorite area is still around Victoria station. There was a 24 small grocery store under the bridge. There was also a convenience Tesco Express on the Strand. Two subway stop away was Sainbury on Wilton around Victoria Station. The Sainbury had excellent of cheese, wine, fresh bread pastries and a vast cheaper of groceries. I can recommend the Yum Yum pastries,We walk to Charing Cross railway to get a cab to Victoria rail Station. cost approx 7.5 pounds.Hotel was in a newer building. Check in time is at 3:00 pm.We had room 415 which was very quiet. It had a view of an air shaft.There was no separate toilet as indicated on the website. The tub was very deep and always had plenty of hot water. There was a laundry drying rack in the bathtub. Two large towels and two small towels were provided. There was also a set-own-combination safe. Plus a small closets for clothes , an ironing board and iron were provided.Note: there is a light switch near the front door that closes the majority of light in the rrom.Laundry was 7 pounds for the washer (detergent is included) and the dryer. The washer took 1.5 hours to wash our clothes. The dryer was on for 35 minutes and dry didn't everything. So we hung the clothes in the bathroom and turned up the heater.The kitchen was a closet in the main room. Ifn fact the bathroom was three times the size of the kitchen. You got four of everythingdishes and cutlery. Plus there was nice extra like pasta bowls,flower vase etc. There was also a set of pots and pans. The stove was very very slow in heating up. The main room was small with two 30 inch twin beds set up. The TV had satellite channels.The reception staff was very friendly but we had to ask twice for an extra blanket and extra pillow. The free computer in the lobby best time was in the early morning or late at night.I suggest you bring some J clothes to use for the sink and to use for disposal face clothes. Also bring a small amount of liquor dish detergemt for doing dishes and washing clothes."
41,632,"Nov 6 2008 	Never Ever Again	Colleagues and I were booked into this place for 1 night as our travel department couldn't get us a decent hotel. Can't believe we paid 126 EACH to sleep on sofa beds! The showers were a mere trickle of water that changed temperature from freezing to tepid or scalding on a whim.The receptionists on arrival were unhelpful and dspite there being 2 of them only one could be bothered to check us in. Not only that 9 for a continental breakfast is a massive rip off. The only point in it's favour is location and it was fairly clean. I'd never use this place again and will also be advising our trvel section NOT to use them again. Horrible,horrendous and overpriced."
42,632,Oct 19 2008 	Very disappointed	We are a family of 4 - children aged 13 and 10 and we stayed here in a 1 bedroom apartment for 2 nights. The location is superb but first contact with the staff on arrival flavoured our whole experience. We arrived at about 9am from New York extremely tired. As we wanted to be able to get straight into our room we had booked and prepaid for the night before. First of all the staff could not find our booking and then the second staff member after finding it said our room would not be ready until 3pm. It took considerable argument from us to get them to admit that they had given away our room the night before and even further discussion with the duty manager to finally be given a room. This was unprofessional and extremely disappointing. The following day the manager gave us a note apologising and a bowl of fruit!! But we saw this as a bit of a cop out. Like many of the other reviews we would also agree that the room was very tired and staff appeared not well trained. We stayed at the Citadines Paris - St Germain - and had a wonderful experience. Therefore our criticism is of this hotel only and should not be taken as comment on the chain as a whole.
43,632,"Oct 9 2008 	Great location very poor value	Stayed here 2 years ago also. Brilliant location is the only reason to consider this property. Run down rooms and inefficient staff with limited english. Took almost an hour to check in...staff couldn't operate computer, photocopier etc. We were intially given a disused room in the buiding. One very hard working male staff member was trying to fix all the mistakes. Stayed at Citadines Paris Louvre also on this trip and facillities and staff were very good. Management really need to spend some money on this tired property and attract more experienced staff."
44,632,"Sep 9 2008 	Great Hotel in the heart of the city	We stayed in this hotel with our 2 children (ages 3 &amp; 5). The kids slept in the bedroom while my husband &amp; I were on the couch in the living room. I have to admit that the couch is very comfortable. There is a kitchenette which is very convenient (especially while on a trip with the kids). We were always able to give them a snack since there is a fridge, stove, toaster &amp; dishwasher. The hotel is very clean and the service is great. If we required something it was just a quick call away. We were well taken care of by the staff. Also, breakfast is available at the hotel, which is pretty nice as well. Nice selection of food.The hotel is right by Trafalgar Square (about a 2 min walk). There are a million shops, restaurants and site seeing tours all around. Having said that, it does get noisy at night. There are a few pubs around and the people get pretty loud after a few too many. It bothered us first couple of nights, but we got use to it. I guess that's the price you pay for staying in the heart of the city. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again."
45,632,"Sep 8 2008 	Much better than expected	We stayed in a studio facing the road. As some of the Tripadvisor reviews had been quite poor, my expectations were low. I was then pleasantly surprised - the (double pull out) bed was roomy and comfortable, the staff were polite (even when I had moan, more later), the room size was ok, everything worked (almost, the hairdryer wasn't great). The location was fantastic! The only thing I didn't like was when I discovered that I hadn't been advised that for stays of less than 6 days, room cleaning is extra. We'd had a takeaway curry the night before and the leftovers were a bit smelly, and we'd used most of the loo roll (not connected!) so this wasn't particularly welcome news. When I grumbled a bit about not being advised and huffily stated that I wasn't paying an extra 15 just for a toilet roll, the lady on duty handled me very well indeed - the curry boxes were removed and toilet rolls were placed forthwith :-)I was really pleased that we'd found an apartment so we could save a bit of money on evening meals, and being right in the centre of London was a bonus. The decor was a bit faded but that won't put me off staying there again."
46,632,"Sep 5 2008 	location great	Great location. Walking distance to tons of attractions. We booked 2 bedroom on 8th floor. Very tight. Bathroom not especially clean- hair on walls, etc... Odd layout. Toilet on 1st floor- shower &amp; vanity on 2nd floor. Broken shower head- never fixed during our stay. We referred to the circular stairs to the 2nd floor as the suicide stairs. Not great for the 3 &amp; 5 year olds. Actually, 12 year old slipped a few times, too. Hubby &amp; I slept on fold out in living room- not so bad. Willing to overlook all of its short comings for the price and location. Will bring bleach next time : )"
47,632,"Sep 1 2008	Great location	We had a 2 bed apartment on the 8th floor which was quite comfortable. Rather than use the fold out lounge we paid extra for a rollaway which we took upstairs(only the mattress though as the spiral staircase was too small) so the 5 of us were accomodated quite well. The kitchen in the cupboard worked well and the internet was good. The decor is a bit dated but what you are paying for here is location. It is in a relatively quiet part of London as the road is not busy. It feels safe in the neighbourhood and all the attractions of the river, trafalgar square and the palace are easily walked too. When you want to venture further afield the underground is 2 minutes away. I would happily stay in the same place again"
48,632,"Aug 25 2008 	Give it a miss	If you like sleeping on a sofa bed (quite uncomfortable for 2 adults), old bally blankets, tired looking rooms and rude service when you check in... then look no further! We booked in for 1 night and were truly disappointed in our choice. The location is great and lobby quite plush but thats where it ends. It was definately the only disappointing accommodation of our trip. That will teach me not to check on trip advisor first!"
49,632,"Aug 15 2008 	greast location good hotel	This hotel was exactly as advertised! Close to everything! We were able to walk to all the major areas of tourist interest! Restaurants for breakfasts (don't do the continental in hotel it is 9 euros per person) lunch are very close and convertry area is full of options just minuteas away on foot.Highly recommend the hop on hop off bus as it is close and gets you everywhere!The rooms are small yet more than adequate, note to self ,if you want a double bed be specific in your request other wise you will get pull out twins! But even they are just fine!Hotel had good clean rooms and bathrooms but since it is an apartment style venue towls are not done daily unless you request it.Would recommend this place for proximity to everything!!"
50,632,"Aug 11 2008 	Dont be fooled by the fab lobby!!!!	We stayed in this hotel for two nights while in London to see some shows. The room, which was booked for four of us had a pretty clean kitchenette, however, although told that the room was capable of holding 4 (and we were charged specifically at a rate for 4) The TINY living rrom area had just had a bed thrown into the middle of it. The bathroom and toilet wer absolutely tiny just off the tiny hallway and although I would neve complain about old decor this was old shabby and not particulary clean. All prices which we were quoted excluded VAT but this was not pointed out very well which turned out to be a policy, as, when requesting late checkout onthe final day we were quoted a price but when going to pay, of course VAT was added. The ONLY upside of the hotel was the proximity to the tube and the Central but it would be easy to get something alot nicer for the same money and I certainly wouldnt go back"
51,632,"Aug 2 2008 	Okay/functional/livable NEEDS UPDATES !!!	Great Location,fairly clean,great hotel staff,adequate kitchnette &amp; bathroom ....BUT, I wrote the company &amp; told them IF they wanted to be a Four Star Hotel (as they claim), they need to UPDATE.Hotel Matresses,in SAD SHAPE,Bed Blankets OLD ie.(pilled up everywhere,like somthing from the 60's),Pillows Flat &amp; Carpets need replacing (old,faded,stained in the rooms only...Lobby okay) Furniture, is like in the 60'-70's but in fair/good shape &amp; may be new retro look, but in ok condition. BUT, this hotel, owned by a major corporation around the world (making millions) needs to spend some cash on firm pillowtop matresses,soft new blankets &amp; plush pillows ...what are the most important things in a hotel room? .cleanliness &amp; the comfort of the BED. It would be a great little 3-4 Star Hotel, if they would just make these changes !!! ps. If you are going for 3 or more days I would get the 1 berroom room (for 4 people) &amp; not the studio w/ pull out couch ...we did this &amp; it was enough room not to go stir crazy...the studio, is too small for 2 people for more than a few days.

52,632,"Jul 27 2008 	Has seen better days	I stayed at this hotel about 4 years ago and went there again recently - in July 2008.There are 2 good things about this hotel. Firstly, as mentioned by other reviewers, its location is very central. Second, there is no charge for high speed internet access.Other than that, there is a lot to be desired. In 2004, when I was there, it seemed like the facility was in pretty good shape. My recent visit showed that it has not been maintained that well.For example, the hallway carpet is worn out, had several stains and patches. Inside the room that I stayed in, the carpet was also worn out. One woujld be afraid of walking bare foot in the room.So overall, while it is in a very central location - allowing you to walk to the theatres and the shopping area - the place is now run down, It has seen much better days."
53,632,"Jul 25 2008 	Great Hotel	Great Hotel. Excellent location. Within walking distance to many London attractions and an underground station is only a 2 minute walk. Rooms were clean and modern. We travelled with our three teenagers and they had their own one bedroom apartment, which was very large. My husband and I had an efficiency apartment which was also large enough. We had a sleeper sofa instead of a bed, but it was very comfortable, not a problem at all. Also, having a kitchen was very convenient.Because it is an apartment hotel the maids do not clean everyday, but I actually prefer that. It was not a problem for us to use the same towels for three days. The only thing I would suggest is to bring your own washcloths because our rooms did not have any and when I asked the boy at the front desk for some he had no idea what I was talking about. Fortunately I had read some of the reviews here before going and had brought some of our own from home.Aside from that, the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. They called us a cab when we needed one to the train station and it was there on time and reasonable.Again, this hotel is in an excellent location. It is in a nice area, we always felt safe. It is also close to so many London tourist spots, including the London Eye, Aquarium, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace. I will highly recommend this hotel to families and couples. The price was reasonable and I felt we certainly got a lot for our money."
54,632,"Jul 18 2008 	Great location	Basic, smallish room, 6th floor. Nice view, great location. Perfect for West End (musicals), restaurants, sight-seeing. Free internet computer. Good kitchen facility."
55,632,"Jul 3 2008 	LocationLocationLocation	Hotel is an aparthotel starting with one room studios with sofabed We have previously stayed in one of these and found that our old bones were not too comfortable. We tried for one of the one bedroom apartments, but these are for minimum of two nights during summer season. The helpful staff suggested we arrived early and they would see what they could do. In the end we were given a twin bedded studio and this was quiet and comfortable.The great advantage of Citadines is its proximity to all the London theatres and one minute from Trafalgar square, but away from traffic as down Northumberland Avenue. We were in town to see 'Joseph' and the Adelphi theatre was barely 10 mins stroll away.Also nearby are The Savoy and Fortnum&amp;Mason. London Eye is at the bottom of the street across the river. A bit expensive but as you are provided with fully equipped kitchen, including dishwasher, meals are easily prepared or can be delivered from several restaurants. 24hr shopping is 50 yds away. One or two meals eaten in your room will more than cover the small extra charge and you will save a fortune on taxis.Book early as we are not the only ones to appreciate this unique hotel.Johnep"
56,632,"Jun 30 2008 	Mixed feelings = great location adequate room poor service	Four of my adult relatives and I booked an apartment for three days. The location is fabulous with the tube, London Eye, theatre district and even attractions like Big Ben and Westminster Abbey close by. The apartment was clean and well-equipped though the interior overall is a little tired. We encountered a huge problem with the toilet downstairs and the shower upstairs because my mom could not negotiate the stairs and I would be concerned for families with small children because the stairs are a little steep. Able adults would be fine. However, my greatest frustration was with the front desk staff. The various people attending us took care of the essentials but wouldn't assist us with anything that required extra assistance from something as small as asking for an extra basin (we were told there were none to be had in the whole building) to helping me contact a taxi that would accommodate a wheelchair (clearly, the hotel has an agreement with private drivers). To end on a positive note, a computer with free internet access is available in the lobby."
57,632,"Jun 4 2008 	Highly Recommend	I'm actually writing this while sitting at the desk in my studio suite. My window is open and I'm listening to the sounds of London in the background.My stay has been wonderful. I was a bit put off by the fact I have a sofa bed instead of a &quot;real&quot; bed. I must say it is every bit as comfortable as a bed would have been. The room is clean. Quiet (if and when I close the window). And comfortable. The bathroom is a nice size and has a full tub with a stand up shower. The kitchenette is small but efficient. There is an apartment size fridge with a freezer. There is a two-burner cook top and a dishwasher. Also a kettle and a toaster as well as pots and pans, cutlery and dishes. There are two closets and an in-room safe.I can't comment on the breakfast, as I haven't been to the breakfast room.The only negative comment I have is the cigarette smoke. It is a non-smoking building, but my room is right above the front door, where all the smokers stand. I can smell it even with the window closed."

59,632,Apr 21 2008 	Excellent Location	This is a fantastic location.Staff are a little indifferent but who cares when you are right in the right place.Highly recomend and will be returning to this hotel in the future for sure. We usually stay in South Kensington.
60,632,"Apr 16 2008 	Great Stay as always	I have stayed at this hotel three times in the past several years. My primary reason for traveling to London these days is to go to the theatre and see friends. The most recent trip was from April 3rd- April 10th. The weather and temperatures fluxuated wildly whilst I was there, and the room temperatures were always comfortable.This hotel is incredibly convenient. It usually has a great rate that I can get, and as I am usually by myself on these trips - it is perfect for the single traveller. I like the fact that I can literally walk everywhere I need to and I don't have to rely on the tube or buses for getting around. Unless I have to travel a little farther afield, and in those situations the Embankment tube station is literally around the corner.It is a five minute walk up to the TKTS booth in Leicester Square- which means less time standing in the queue! As to the hotel itself:I have always found this hotel to be clean, and I like the fact that I won't be disturbed by maid service- if I have a bad case of jetlag- which envariably I do!I always get a studio- and whilst the bed is a sofabed type I have no complaints about it. The refrigerator and microwave are the lifesavers here, as eating out in restaurants can be a lengthy process, and when one is by oneself, not exactly enjoyable. I can get take away from a variety of places, go to the M &amp;S food only shop in Charing Cross Station- 2 minutes from the hotel- or Tesco Metro at the top of Northumberland Ave- another 2 minute walk.I have been there during the summer and winter months and have found the room temperatures comfortable and easy to manage.The hairdryer in the bathroom is my only complaint! I know this style is common throughout Europe and I've always hated it. It is not feasable nor advisable to bring my hair dryer from home- as even with converters- then tend to fry and die! So using this quasi - vaccum cleaner hose as a dryer is a bit of a pain!The kitchen area in my studio unit was separated into a tiny little room. The bathroom was fine. My only other complaint- and it's not really a complaint, just an observation on the aging process- is that it's a bit of a steep and somewhat slippery climb out of the bathtub- it's very high by American standards. But- it's not too big of an issue. If one has difficulties with coordination and lifting up and going down a steep tub- this could be a problem.The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful.A word of caution-I usually get the Heathrow Express to the Airport. Going to and From Paddington Station- Depending on the time of day one checks out- it is much cheaper to get a black cab around the corner outside the Embankment station than it is to use the hotel's mini-cab service. This last time I had to leave very early in the morning and no black cabs were in sight- so I used their mini-cab service. It is expensive. Considering two nights before I used a different mini-cab service to get me from Roehampton where I was visiting friends to my hotel it cost 26pounds- The fare to Paddington Station at 6am in the morning- was 20.00- I needed to get there so I paid it. I also knew the hotel's minicab rate was way overpriced. But, I was stuck and paid the fare. Overall-This is a hotel for people who like the convenience factor without the frills or the outrageous sums of money that most central london hotels charge- Especially now as the dollar is tanking in the Global currency market. For fellow Americans who see this hotel as expensive and think it is $200 plus a night (depending on roomtype) and think it doesn't hold up to a comparable US priceline- Get over it. This is England- For Central London- this is a reasonable and for the most part, depending on the floor you're on (I've been on the 1st floor, 3rd floor, and this past time the 6th floor) and the rooms are fairly quiet. You don't get a tremendous amount of road noise. I stayed in a Hotel in Mayfair that was not soundproofed and hardly slept at all, as the little road the hotel was on- was a major route for the black cabs. Also, the room size you will be getting will most likely be larger than any comparably priced hotel in London.  The Citadines offers great flexibility to eating options that most hotels do not offer. This hotel has kitchen facilities. Believe me- this is far better than some lousy, expensive breakfasts I've had over the years in other hotels. I have read that they offer breakfast. Why would you spend that money on one meal when you can get better elsewhere and cheaper to boot? Take the time to get provisions- so you can have an enjoyable morning. Most touristy places and shops don't open until 10am, so a little planning can give you a great breakfast and a lie in!For great breakfast pastries walk up to Paul in Covent Garden. Also Pret A Manger has great croissants, sandwiches and coffee!I would rather spend the money I'm saving to better use, such as a theatre ticket or two, than for a hotel with a lot of extras- that really don't mean much to me-"
61,632,"Apr 9 2008 	Great Location 	I stayed here in March whilst waiting to move into a new flat, the location was fantastic; central and within easy reach of nightlife, public transport and shopping. I had a studio which was adequate and of comparable size to other city hotel rooms. The staff were very friendly, yes, you only get amenities such as bathroom supplies, dishwasher tablets and toilet paper on arrival, but they are all available at the front desk free of charge if you need more, you just have to ask. I would recommend this apart'hotel to anyone if they want the freedom and convenience."
62,632,"Mar 31 2008 	Good location bad everything else... including the rudest staff I've ever seen!	Location is fab, no denying that. Very close to the tube station and can even walk to Soho/ Leicester sq. But just about everything else is so appalling... where do I begin...OK I think the definition of &quot;Studio with Sofa bed&quot; has got taken a bit too far and too literal here. My room when I went in, was literally one small room with a kitchenette, a tiny tv and a sofa. THERE WAS NO BED! It was just one small living room. And that old sofa...yes...that's right...that's your bed. How silly of me to assume that a studio with sofa bed means there's a bed an there's also a sofa. I thought that proper beds were pretty much a given in any hotel or serviced apartment room -- especially when you're paying this much. The sofa cushions are your pillows and the sheet and thin blanket are already folded into the sofa. If you have slept on a sofa bed, you know that it is not comfortable at all, and this one even feels dirty. Imagine things that fall into sofas, well I definitely felt very itchy sleeping on this sheet that has been stuffed into this old sofa. When I pulled the bed out of the sofa there was a lot of long curly hair that came out with it and onto my bed. It was really gross. The kitchenette was well equipped, but get this -- THEY DON'T CLEAN YOUR ROOM FOR THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE STAYING THERE. They only come and clean rooms when guests check out. No cleaning equipment is given either so you have to go and buy your own if you are staying there for more than 2 nights. I happened to be staying there for 5 nights, so for 6 days my toilet and bathroom were never cleaned, my bed was never made and my rubbish bin was over stuffed. Another gross point. The staff are in general not very efficient. But one in particular shocked me because she was so rude, even for London standard. She was walking in the lobby area and I wanted to ask her where the laundry room was. I said hello to her first and before I could even ask my question, she put her hand up, shook her face to indicate 'no' and kept walking, she didn't even look at me. I was so shocked. This is the kind of thing you might get in London for asking direction on the street to someone who's in a hurry. But when you are a paying guest and a staff does this to you? Seriously, I don't know how anyone could possibly think that that is acceptable. Unbelievably rude, what is she even doing working in this industry?And talk about the laundry room-- don't use it. You can't use your own detergent and the one that automatically gets dispensed into the machine smells really bad. You're better off going to a place outside the Citadines. It'll cost you less and it won't ruin your clothes or make you stink of cheap chemicals. All in all, this is what I'll say about staying here -- NEVER AGAIN."
63,632,"Mar 27 2008 	Fantastic and Amazing for the price	Booked this hotel via Easyjet holidays. Checked reviews on trip advisor and chose the hotel for its cleanliness rating and location. The location however, was even more outstanding than expected being only minutes away from Trafalgar Square and the Theatre District in one direction and a stone's throw from Whitehall and the embankment in the other. The lobby was very impressive however, our group expected that to be for show and the rooms would be poky and basic. We couldn't have been more wrong. At an average cost per person of 50 a night the apartments were fully self contained including dishwashers, LCD tvs with satellite channels and remote control music centres. All rooms overlloked the surrounding streets and although there was some noise at night with bottles and bins being taken out, the beds were extremely comfortable, little touches like tea, coffee and milk were appreciated and complimentary papers in the morning at reception were welcome. There was also a small internet area for keeping in touch. Having visited london on countless occasions and stayed in many types of hotel (from 1 to 5 star), this small aparthotel greatly impressed and I know my group of accompanying students and staff will all be using it again."
64,632,"Mar 22 2008 	Great location great space some noise bring your own towels	We stayed in the triple/quad - One bedroom apartment with double bed and full size pull out couch in the living room. One bedroom / living room/ kitchen. The apartment was large by European standards. Bedroom was big enough to fit the bed and a couple of side tables. We had giant windows and plenty of light. Although the apartment was basically clean - there was a mysterious &quot;stain&quot; on the carpet in the livingroom, it looked as if it was an old stain that had been cleaned and left a discolored spot. There were a few issues: a crack above the closet - it didn't really bother us though, the toilet was in a room by itself with no sink and loud bar patrons on the street below our apartment. Finally, if you stay less than 7 days - you don't get fresh towels unless you pay for them."
65,632,"Mar 22 2008 	Great Location	Stayed for 8 nights beginning of March. The location is fantastic - just off Trafalgar Square (National Gallery, Nelson's Column, Portrait Gallery) and with in walking distance to Big Ben, Parliment, Westminster Abbey, Thames. Close to Charing Cross and Embankment tube stations, clipper tours of river. Had Studio room with 2 twin beds, small fridge, microwave, stove-top, dishwasher, electric kettle. Allows you to cook (somewhat) or buy prepared meals to reheat. This was such a plus as everything in London is basically double the price it is in the US. We only ate out a handful of times in our eight days (the Sherlock Homes Pub &amp; Restaraunt is right around the corner from the hotel, and there are many fast food places with in a few blocks). There are at least three grocery stores with in 3 blocks of the Citadines so we stocked the fridge with drinks and snacks - there is no Room Service. They do offer a continental breakfast in a breakfast room off the lobby until 10 am, but it came to be almost $18 per person. Room is clean, stocked with dishes, towels, complimentary instant coffee, tea, toiletries, hi-fi and tv. Full bath w/ shower and handicapped accessible. Blow-dryer in bath. The staff was extremely helpful in giving directions and summoning a doctor to the room for medical problem. Room cleaning is offered once if you stay 7 days. The room was actually fairly well soundproofed (we could just make out the wooshing of the elevator that was right outside our door). There is a garbage shute at the end of the hall. The size of the room is what you'd expect in Europe, relatively small with some closet space, an in-room safe and iron w/ board. Big enough for two, with a good sized bath. I will definitely stay here again when travelling to London - it really was like having your own apartment in the city. I would stay here if travelling alone, after 10 pm you need your keycard to open the door to the hotel and it seems like a fairly safe place."
66,632,"Feb 15 2008 	location means we will stay again - but don't expect perfection	We booked to stay at the Citadines for 2 nights. I had spent a lot of time looking where to stay and based on reviews on Tripadvisor had gone for this property.As stated in other reviews, the location was fab. Turn left and you were a minute away from the river, a couple of minutes away from Embankment tube station. Short walk away from the London Eye, Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and many theatres. There was also various shops to buy bits for your room - Tesco Extra at the end of the road and Marks &amp; Spencers Simply food by Charing Cross Station.In the evenings, it was lovely to walk around we always felt very safe. One evening we strolled up to Covent Garden, to the Thai Pot - delicious and not too busy. The next evening we went to Pizza Express and had a lovely meal.The accommodation itself - the lobby is a little dated. Didn't have breakfast so can't comment on the food served. Our apartment was for 6 people. It was basic but served the purpose we wanted it for. The kitchen is well equipped, but some dishes were a little dirty. They supply 1 dishwasher tablet, no washing up liquid, so I guess you are expected to provide your own!The first morning we woke, we found none of the lights worked. Having rang reception, and waiting 35 minutes, someone came up and said that there was a switch that always needed to be left on for the lights to work. You would think there would be a sign to say that, it just looked like a normal light switch! There were so many, we were flicking them off all the time! Also, the hairdryer didn't work nor one of the heaters in the bedrooms.I would stay at the Citadines Trafalgar Square again for its location and reasonable price. But don't expect too much. The beds are fine and facilities, but there is something lacking."
67,632,"Jan 8 2008	the location can not be better great location!!!	we stayed here in February and March 2007. Location can not be better, minutes walk to the Embankment with the London Eye, House of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, mins walk to the National Art Gallery, Leicester Sq, and a majority of the West End theatres.Next time we will upgrade to a bigger room though. We will be back after comparing another apartment hotel to the Citadines."
68,632,"Jan 4 2008 	Great location great price!	I was looking for an inexpensive hotel for a weekend while I was in London for a weekend with a friend. The location here could not have been better! We were in walking distance of lots of shopping, restaurants, and theaters. The hotel room served its purpose- we had a studio, which consisted of just a bed, a small kitchenette, and a good sized bathroom. Since we weren't staying that long, we didn't need anything lavish and this served the purpose! It also was one of the cheapest places we were able to find. I would totally stay here again!"
69,632,"Dec 21 2007 	Loved the location	We stayed here in September in a one bedroom apartment as a family of 2 adults and two teenage children.We were very impressed with the convenient location and easy access to tourist sites. The beds were comfortable, especially after a long flight and facilities were quite good. The kitchen was small but convenient for cooking small meals and the washing machine was very good.The service from the staff was OK although reception staff were quite slow. I would recommend this for a family and for the easy access to the London sights."
70,632,"Nov 12 2007	Not bad-great location	The best thing about this place? Location. Near the square, a few tube stations, the millinium bridge, bus stops in the square. The Sherlock Holmes pub is just down the street and we did listen to noisey pub goers coming down the street until after midnight, but that was the only downfall - thin walls. It was nice to have a small kitchen, although our stove didn't work, but we mainly kept food in the small fridge for breakfasts and snacks. There is a small grociery store around the corner and again, a perfect location. It was clean and the staff was helpful. Some reviews say it is small, but I would ask, are you planning to hang out in your room for long periods of time? Wouldn't you only use it for sleep? European rooms are typically smaller - Americans don't always realize this (I'm an American, too). I didn't think the size was a bid deal anyway. I would stay again because the location is great for just about anything you want to do. It is not fancy and not the Savoy, but I would stay again. One word - the in- room hairdryer is like a vacuum hose that was cracking from the heat. Bring a converter and your own dryer."
71,632,"Oct 22 2007 	Great Location Poor Staff	This appartment hotel has a great location in downtown London, just a stone's throw from Trafalgar Sq, Big Ben, London Eye &amp; Buckingham Palace. The rooms are clean and mostly well maintained. The staff are, however, a huge let down for the hotel. They are poorly trained and most are very unhelpful. They could not even tell me how to get to the hotel's own carpark or where I could find a Chinese restaurant, when China Town was less than a 5 minute walk away. They were unwilling to listen and they were so bound up by rules and regulations that everything was a hastle for them. They did not listen to simple requests and they claimed not to understand us even though English is our first language (something that could not be said for several of the staff). In short, I would expect much more from a hotel in a group of this size and at such a price."
72,632,"Oct 21 2007 	Great Location- Room ok	Stayed at Citadines in a 1 bedroom apartment, 2A and 1Child, was a fair size for the location (was not big by anyones imagination) but what do you want you are out most of the time) everything was close Tesco around the corner so we could buy grocery items (staying 7 nights we needed to) washing very expense to do there!!! no extras at all included. And we found the staff as helpful as there knowledge let them be they never had a problem in trying to help us with directions. If any faults i would want the rooms alot bigger but you get what you pay for."
73,632,"Sep 30 2007 	Great location	Nice Hotel in a great location. Very close to the underground stop and just 10 minutes from Piccadilly. Friendly staff and clean room, small kitchen and a studio couch instead of a normal bed.A few problems with the door lock. It's actually a residence, so we haven't had our room made for the whole stay (3 nights)."
74,632,"Sep 25 2007	Basic Hotel in a Great Location	The good thing about this hotel is the location, just a few steps away from Trafalgar Square, West End, London Eye, etc. The room is very basic though. We stayed at the stuido room and it was a bit smallish and the worst part is the sofa beds. Not so comfortable really.Next time I'm in London, I'll pay a bit extra and stay in real hotel."
75,632,Sep 20 2007 	Good value despite drawbacks	Excellent location and reasonable price. 500 cheaper than other hotels in central London at least. Nothing included though - clean towels or more toilet paper costs extra! Towels small too. Bed just a very old fashioned and unwieldy sofa bed. Staff fine but we didn't need anything. Room clean enough and good to be able to make tea/coffee etc. Very quiet too. We were loking out onto Northumberland street and could not hear the traffic. We are used to silence in the country so the double glazing was excellent.
76,632,"Aug 23 2007 	Your room is cancelled...at 03.30 am	The location is excellent, but that you can see from the map. We made our booking trough [--] and I also informed that we will arrive very late. The plane landed at midnight and after some delays at the airport, we were at the Gitadines reception at 03.30 am. The &quot;receptionist&quot; kindly informed us that our booking was CANCELLED, because we arrived too late!!! Sorry - I cannot understand, because the room was booked, confirmed and also paid. I checked it on the same day from [--]. The man was clearly not capable with his job and started to make phone calls: &quot;what I must do now...etc&quot;. There were empty rooms available, but he could not give us one, because our booking was cancelled (by them). After 40 minutes waiting (04.40 am) he at last got instructions from someone slighty more professional: &quot;now you give them a room and we will sort out this next&quot;. Wonderful. Thank you very much...We stayed at room 812 and it was very small also to European standards. There we no proper beds, only one sofa-bed and one blanket for two persons. Next day I asked if they could give us an extra blanked. &quot;No problem - nice that you reminded&quot; was the answer, but no blanket. The next day I made my second try with same results and gave up the hope.Yes - the location is good, but there are also other hotels in London."
77,632,"Aug 10 2007	What a snip!	We stayed for one night on a Saturday while attending a wedding in Pall Mall. Location was superb, as it would be for all London sightseeing.We paid GBP84 for a studio which was ridiculously cheap (through Advertising on line). Their excellent underground secure car park was GBP20 for 24 hours - again, very cheap for location.The studio gave us everything we needed for an overnight stay - once we discovered how to turn the sofa into a bed!Bathroom was excellent, towels, toiletries, hot water all well up to good hotel standards. Bath was more like a US tub - only downside.Studio fitted with good kitchen (including dishwasher &amp; d/w tablet), TV, hi- fi, wi-fi (all free) and there was a free computer in lobby if you forgot to bring your own!Staff were polite and efficient. Lift worked well.What more could you expect for price? Nothing. Whole experience highly satisfactory and will be repeated."
78,632,"Aug 10 2007	Basic but met our needs	Stayed here on Saturday 28th July 2007 with 2 friends. I had rung to check that they had a left luggage facility, but we were able to check in to our room when we arrived at 11.30am which was really useful. Please note that the reception staff, whilst not rude, have certainly not been to charm school! (Water off a duck's back to us though).We had a one bed suite with a (slightly tatty and slightly squeaky) sofa bed in the lounge. There was a tv and mini hifi. The kitchen is tiny - fridge, microwave, hot plates, dishwasher. No washing up liquid or tea towels, but we there was one dishwasher tablet. There is no tea / coffee / sugar etc. The shower in the bathroom was very weak and there was a bath which had slightly wobbly taps. There were 2 towels each and the usual bathroom miniatures.Overall, the apartment was clean, and although basic, it met all of our needs for an overnight stay (we went out for dinner). In the kitchen we didn't use the hot plates but everything else worked fine. We all slept well despite a minor distrubance from the bin men on the streets below (we were on the first floor).Finally - the Tesco Express on the corner of N'land Ave &amp; Trafalgar Square is very small - and doesn't stock newspapers. There is a bigger one at the far end of the Strand, but the best is the Covent Garden Metro on Bedford Street.There is also a small M&amp;S food store at Charing Cross.We would happily stay here again."
79,632,Aug 7 2007 	Rudest staff terrible kitchen facilities great location.	I stayed here with my husband and 2 children and just felt I had to write about it to warn others! The kitchen facilities are dreadful -2 hot plates to cook a meal on! The smoke alarm was directly over the hot plates and went off when I cooked a few sausages for my kids. The staff were then extremely rude and told us to stop cooking immediately and then proceeded to ring us 4 times in short sucession and were nothing short of abusive. We then had to order out - too afraid to use the &quot;cooking&quot; facilities again! The bedrooms were small and pokey. On the plus side its in a great location but thats all it has in its favour. I dont think I've ever encountered such rude staff and I'm a well seasoned traveller. Dont come here if you want to self cater and don't bother asking the staff anything!
80,632,"Aug 1 2007 	Great cheaper hotel in best location in London!	After reading a couple reviews that weren't favorable, I had to post. I first stayed at the Citadines Trafalgar Square last summer when I was sent to London for work last minute. While every other hotel in the city was around 300 pounds a night, my room was 155 pounds; I stayed a week. My husband came along and worked remotely in the room every day; no internet problems, and a nice work area, and a radio to listen to Capital FM all day! Since my first visit to the Citadines, I've been back to London 5 times, and have stayed here every single time. The prices is ALWAYS cheaper than anything else comparable. I'm a travel agent so I can often get good deals a 4 or 5 star hotels, but I still prefer the convenience of the kitchen and location of the Citadines; this is why you stay here.The kitchen isn't huge, but it's sufficient for having breakfast and lunch supplies; which will save you much more money than you can imagine with the current rate of the dollar to the pound. For a cheap meal, there are 3 &quot;Pret's&quot; within a 2-3 minute walk to buy cheap and delicious sandwiches! Really, with the prices becoming so high with the poor exchange rate, buying groceries is a great way to save money. But don't eat all of your meals in, there are fantastic restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk.Which brings me to the greatest feature of the hotel. The location. Northumberland is a quiet, peaceful, tree lined street. The rooms facing the street do have sound proofing and you don't hear a thing. If you walk 10 minutes to the north you are in Leicster Square and Picadilly. A 5 minute walk to the south and your on the river, where the trendiest restaurants have 2 hour waits! But 5 minutes from there is Big Ben and Parliament. When I go to London my work is to the east of Covent Garden; and even this is a 15-20 minute, pleasant walk. You absolutely can not beat the location of this hotel. The location on a quiet, pleasant street is like a refreshing, enjoyable stroll after a day in the loud city. Yes, it's a little worn, but I've always found it clean, and the staff friendly; and they will give you more toilet paper if you go to the front desk and get it."
81,632,"Jul 25 2007 	Care Not Citadines	I had stayed at Citadines Louvre Paris. It was swell. Ergo, I booked Citadines Trafalgar London. Grave error. The hotel has a Private Club next door who has a venue in the basement under a wing of the hotel. There is no sleep but you do bounce to the rhythm of the very loud music. The music ran until 1:30 AM. The desk gave not one hoot. Also DO NOT have the hotel call you a taxi. They provide a &quot;cab&quot; that is not a cab and charges 1/3 more than a regular taxi. They do not give you a final bill, they convert your dollars to pounds them selves rather than have your credit card do it. BIG BUCKS! The nicest person there was the maid.I have stayed many places 1* to 5*- This place is definitely to be missed. A letter to the corporate office went unanswered."
82,632,"Jul 19 2007 	Perfect !	Perfect apartment hotel. I stayed July 4th till the 14th. I got the 2 bedroom + family room + kitchen + 1 bathroom + 1 shower. Theres 4 of us. There's only 1 TV in the unit. Of course, why would you watch TV anyway - that would be dumb.The location is the best, walking distance to Covent, Leicester, Picadilly, Pall Mall, the Mall, and the Embankment Underground Station, strand Avenue, Tesco Grocery, etc.etc etc. Bus stop nearby as well. The curb lining up the front of the hotel is lined with trees which creates a coolness with the breeze. We looked at the other hotels that we considered in other London locations and we were so happy we picked the right hotel at the right location."
83,632,"Jul 14 2007 	Great hotel in a fantastic location	My husband and I stayed at the Citadines Trafalgar Square from June 28-July 5, 2007. My husband had lived in London about 10yrs ago and was very impressed with this location. He repeatedly stated that I couldn't have picked a better central location for sightseeing. Thereare also 2 tube stations in the vicinity; Charing Cross and the Embankment; the latter of the two we used more often. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. Having a kitchenette in the room was excellent. We were able to pick up some groceries and keep in our room which in turn saved us money. There was a Tesco (grocery store) just up at the end of the street and a couple more in very short walking distance. We were staying for 7 nights so were entitled to one free room cleaning but ended getting 2 cleanings at no extra charge as well as towel changes. I think they may change the towels every 3 days, we got some extra from the room attendants. bring washcloths if you are used to these. Laundry is expensive 4 pounds towash and 3 pounds to dry; soap is included. The room was very spacious (for european standards) and had air conditioning. We had a studio with a sofa bed which was suprisingly comfortable. There is a computer for use in the lobby but is rarely vacant for use; sometimesa line-up. So if you have a laptop bring it. There is free access in the rooms too. My only complaint would have been a front desk individual (which I will remain nameless) who was VERY unprofessional. To make a long story short; make sure you give your callers the direct line to your room so they can bypass the front desk. The front desk staff don't seem to like being bothered with connecting to rooms; at least this particular individual didn't. Despite this mishap, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Citadines Trafalgar Square and would definately return to stay there upon a return trip to London. We had a fantastic rate ~$200 CAD a night; it can't be beat in an absolutely fantastic location like this one and believe me I spent many hours and days researching hotels in London before our trip. You won't be disappointed!!"
84,632,"Jul 10 2007 	A good aparthotel with a 5* location	We booked an apartment for 6 . I can see that the stairs might be a problem for some, but they are no worse than any average flight of stairs.Slight problems in terms of no basin in the toilet. These apartments could easily fit another bathroom in!Other than that, the accommodation was fantastic value for the money. You can stand in Northumberland Avenue and see Big Ben , the eye and Trafalgar square at the same time. We stayed a weekend and did not use the underground once.Plenty of reasonably priced places to eat nearby, and a Tesco Express on the corner.The two bedrooms were large, as was the sofa bed, and all were comfortable. Having a kitchen is great!!We had plenty of towels, and we also found the reception staff really polite and helpful, orgainising keys for us as we all arrived separatley. The wifi worked no problem, and the computer in reception was always working.All I can say is that some people are never satisfied!! This is a great venue at a reasonable price."
85,632,"Jun 20 2007 	just fine for a family	My husband, myself and two kids ages 14 and 12 stayed at this property from May 28th to June 3rd. We had a 1 bedroom apartment. It had a living room with a pullout sofa bed, and an efficiency kitchen which was against the wall and can be closed off with closet doors. The bedroom had a queen size bed and 2 very tiny night tables. Our particular room had the shower and sink in one room and the toilet in another. This was very convenient when getting ready in the morning. This is not a luxury hotel by any means. It is fairly clean, with very spartan furnishings. What it does give you is pretty good space for london at a pretty reasonable price. It was great having 2 rooms and the bathroom split up. We also went and bought our own toilet paper as theirs did not look too good. We stayed six nights, so we did not get any services. We could have however paid for some services, but they were really expensive, like 20 gbp to clean the room. The location can't be beat. 1 block to trafalgar square and very close to two underground stations.All in all if you are looking for an adequate hotel that is fairly clean, fairly spacious, fairly priced and in a good location, this is the hotel for you."
86,632,"Jun 7 2007 	Perfect Location Above Average Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Citadines Aparthotel at Trafalgar Square (Room #707) in London May 23-May 30, 2007. We requested and received a non-smoking room. We arrived hours before the check-in time at 3 p.m., and we were greeted by Angela at the reception desk who graciously answered all of our questions and provided us with our room keys. Our room was a studio, which meant we slept on a pull-out sofa, which was a bit tricky to convert from sofa to bed, and Im not certain I could have mastered the technique myself. There was a loose-leaf binder with directions for the appliances, but the page for the sofa-bed was missing. The room was sparkling clean with no sign of contamination by smoke, and it was possible to open the window to allow in fresh air.  Housekeeping is done on a weekly basis, but that did not present a huge problem for us as we spent little time in the room and really preferred not having people in and out. The supplies include 2 very small rolls of toilet paper and 2 towels, one bath towel and one hand towel, per person. We were supposed to have received clean towels after 3 days, but that did not happen, and it might be because we slept late that day. There is a device over the tub which pulls out to expose several racks on which to dry hand-laundered items. We used it for the towels, and we had also brought with us 2 old towels (having been alerted by other users of Trip Advisor) and just discarded them before returning home. The room was ample for two. Along one wall, behind folding doors that worked easily, was a counter top, sink, drawers, refrigerator with very small freezer, and 2 electric burners. Above the counter were cupboards with dishes and a microwave oven. You wouldnt be able to prepare an elaborate, gourmet meal, but any economy one can make by not taking all meals out in London is a great convenience and provides tremendous savings, especially for families.  In close proximity to the hotel are at least two small stores from which to purchase items such as paper goods, cereal, milk, sandwiches, juice, bread, cheese, snacks, etc. We made one of those stores our first stop, and spent roughly $30 which guaranteed we could have breakfast in the room each morning and would not have to keep asking for the TP to be replaced. Dining out in London is outrageously expensive. We were told that pub meals may be more reasonably priced, but the pubs were too thick with smoke for us to enjoy. Some pubs have no non-smoking areas, and many of those that do are situated in the same room as the smoking areas. England goes smoke-free in July of 2007. We ate in the non-smoking upstairs dining room at the Sherlock Holmes pub next door to the hotel. We also tried the Red Lion near Westminster Abbey and Pizza Express. There are pretty good hot dog carts outside of the British Museum, and most of the museums have cafes, but in London, plan on spending a good deal of your travel budget on sustenance. The museums, thank God, are wonderful and totally free, although donations are discretely requested. In terms of location, for us Trafalgar Square was perfect. We had purchased two 7-day travelcards, good for Zones 1 and 2, with unlimited rides on tubes and buses. We barely used them. We walked to Westminster Abbey, the British Museum, Westminster Pier (to catch the boat on the Thames to Greenwich), the Garrick Theatre, the National Gallery, the Portrait Gallery, across the Millennium Bridge to Tate Modern. The only time we used public transportation was to get to and from St. Pauls Cathedral on a rainy day. The travelcards also gave us a 33% discount for the boat to Greenwich.  I had originally booked the Citadines studio through Londontown.net because I had not yet made plane reservations, and I needed to be able to cancel or reschedule. It turned out that I was able to book a trip through Northwest using the same hotel, which is what I ended up doing. The cost of the trip was $3,022, which included airfare for two from upstate New York to Gatwick Airport, 7 nights at Citadines/Trafalgar, HotelLink from Gatwick to the hotel and returning to the airport from the hotel on the day of departure, and trip insurance. I thank all the members of Trip Advisor for being so forthcoming in their reviews. Because of that, we knew exactly what to expect, and Citadines more than exceeded our expectations. In fact, when we travel to Paris in the near future, we will try to book with them. The air quality in the room and on the seventh floor was excellent, and the room provided a beautiful view of the trees lining Northumberland Avenue. The hotel was quiet and well-managed, and for a price one can get more extensive housekeeping and more services."
87,632,Apr 24 2007 	Excellent Location and Good Price for London	I had a good studio apartment for the price for 8 nights at 99 pounds plus VAT so can't really complain.For a UK hotel the rooms were quite big with a small kitchen and clean bathroom. The water pressure in the shower is really bad but at least it was hot.You can open the windows and if you have a room at the front (double glazed) there is a nice London view over Scotland Yard.As a serviced apartment it is only cleaned once a week although if you want you can get the bed made up and fresh towels every day for 5 pounds a day extra. The fold out bed was actually quite comfortable!There is free broadband internet accessin the rooms which is a big plus..Location is terrific and you can walk all around the West End.So - you get what you pay for but for value and location I don't think you can beat it! A four star hotel would cost upwards of 160 pounds per night.
88,632,"Apr 23 2007 	London Marathon Weekend	Was a little concerned about some of the reviews on this hotel. I can see why people have complained about not being sparkling clean and not having everything one would expect form a hotel For us (5 adults and 1 child) down to support two marathon runners in our party in was almost perfect. It was clean enough and we were prepared for the other not quite hotel things, thanks to previous reviews.Location, you are in the centre of things, walk to London Eye or Trafalgar square in 5 minutes. Big pasta meal on the Saturday night was possible in the small kitchen. (The Hoover did a good job of holding the door open). The runners just wanted to relax or recover so the extra space was great.On arrival we were offered either a non-smoking 2 bed appartment or a choice of two smoking 2 bed appartments. It was suggeted that the smoking rooms were better and we could check them out for smoke before checking in. We did and they were fine (we hate smoke rooms so we would not have accepted if any hint of smoke). 2 bed appartments are on two floors with a twisting staircase in between, creaky but fine. Two bed rooms bathroom and seperate toilet upstairs Ideal for marathon runners and families for a short break. But will not suit everyone so read\reviews carefully."
89,632,"Apr 17 2007 	A Perfect Location and Reasonably Priced	I stayed in the hotel in Jan, with two friends from college. I've been to London many times and the location was superb. You have a choice of two tube stations- Charing Cross and Embankment which are literally two mins away. Its 1 min walk into Trafalger Square, 10 minutes from the London eye etc and close to everything really. We were attending lots of theatre, and it was great to be able to walk everywhere, or be extremely close to the tube. And we were able to walk to the main shopping area.The accomodation was quite good- a very comfortable fold out sofa and a double bedroom. The toilet is in a separate room to the shower, which can be handy, but the extractor fan wasn't working - still could have been worse. Kitchen area very small, but adequate with a little dishwasher.On the whole the staff were lovely- with the exception of one chap working on reception. He overcharged us on the credit card, and got very irate and rude when we were fixing this error. However, there was a more efficient and courteous memeber of staff who was glad to step in and deal with us in a lovely accomodating manner.We never had breakfast in the hotel, we bought our own in Tesco Express on the corner and ate out or cooked. Hotel is a rip off for food and washing clothes, but these are minor things compared to the location.The hotel was quite aged looking, and could have done with a paint job inside. Everything looked worn out, and the TV stations were crappy. But no one comes to London for the TV, and despite the worn appearance everything was really clean.I'm returning to London in July, and will definitely be staying here again. Enjoy your trip. G"
90,632,"Apr 16 2007	Great Location;Run-down rooms	It is hard to recommend this apartment/hotel because it was just so disappointing. The Citadines Trafalgar Square is in a terrific location. You can walk to the London Eye, Big Ben, Covent Garden, andThe National Gallery. This fact was the only positive. The rooms are in desperate need of a good cleaning and updating. We stayed in a onebedroom apartment. The bed comforter was disgusting. It had hairs wrapped in it and holes. My husband is afraid of bed bugs, so he lifted the sheet to check out the mattress and found another sheet under that one that was full of hairs. It seems that the cleaning staff doesn't remove the bed sheets, they just pile more sheets on top of the dirty ones. It was really gross. The tub was too high off the floor. Someone could really get hurt stepping out if they aren't careful. The apartment also smelled bad. The prices in London are so high, the price for this apartment was cheap compared to others in London, but for what you do pay it should be better. Plus, the Citadines wants to charge for any &quot;extra&quot;. They didn't give us enough towels (Just three towels for four people). I went downstairs and told the front desk and he said there would be an extra charge. I would never stay here again no matter what the price. London was great!"
91,632,Apr 4 2007 	Disapointing!!	I've stayed with my wife and kids in a double room apartment. Good part:Good location. Bad parts: It has no cleaning unless you stay more than a week or you have to pay for extra cleaning (aparthotel???). The rooms are needing a urgent upgrade because they are very deteriorated (carpets burned and dust in every corner of the rooms)The bath has not hot water for a family of 5 (really if 2 take a shower its has to be quick or the 3 gets cold water) and is to small. I complained about the water and they didn't do a thing neither explaind me the reason because there was not enough hor water (probably a electric heater that is not enough for a double apartment)For the same price you can get 2 rooms in a hotel having much more confort or if you want a apartment find another much more cheaper.
92,632,"Mar 26 2007 	Great location for theatreland - good for short stay	I stayed here for one night this weekend. We were going to see a show &amp; needed somewhere to stay for one night. The apartments are 5 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square &amp; Charing Cross station. There is a traditional English pub called &quot;The Sherlock Holmes&quot; just next door &amp; its worth popping in there for a bite to eat. There is a 24 hour Tesco just up the road too. The staff on the front desk were friendly &amp; polite. We were 3 hrs ealy for check in &amp; they let us check in without any problems. Our room was on the 5th floor, this floor really smelled of cigarette smoke, being non-smokers we noticed it straight away. The apartment itself had a distinct smell of vinegar but that went after leaving the windows open. Out aprtmnt slept 4, one double bed (comfy) &amp; a sofa bed &amp; pull out bed (both comfy). The kitchen is the type that is revealed by opening a cupboard door but has everything you need, microwave, dishwasher, cutlery etc. The bathroom was small but adequate &amp; clean &amp; toilet was seperate. There was also an iron &amp; ironing board. We were woken in the night by a fight going on outside but apart from that no problems. You could also see Benjamin Franklins old house from our window!! Overall - very good location, confortable, clean, ideal for a short stay &amp; only 180 between 4 people. Perfect if you are visiting a show!!"
93,632,"Mar 10 2007 	Great with Kids	We stayed here with 2 teenagers and it was perfect. We had a 2 bdrm. small apt. with mini-kitchen. A Tesco is just up the block, so we bought dinner there for the kids to warm up in evenings while the adults went out. This hotel is a great location close to almost everything. We easily walked over to the London Eye and up to Leiscester Sq. Close to 2 tube stops as well."
94,632,"Feb 24 2007	Don't bother...really	Good location, just moments away from Trafalgar Square and the Embankment Tube station, but other than that it's really not worth staying. You get a place to sleep (the beds aren't great), but have to pay for everything else (and I do mean everything): toilet paper, more towels....everything."
95,632,"Jan 18 2007 	Adequate but...	The location is good if you don't mind constant crowds. The hotel lobby is very pleasant and quite impressive for a Citadines.The staff were friendly and helpful---well, some of them were.I had to change rooms until I found one that wasn't tiny (booked a studio), and that had an air conditioner that actually worked.I didn't mind the room. It was cosy with a good sized bathroom. The London Citadines in general are somewhat shabbier than the French ones, so I was expecting that, and this room was basic, but adequate. Unexpectedly, I found I was obliged to extend my stay in London by a few weeks, so I bought a comfortable pillow and a pleasant looking bed cover at Marks and Spencer, and this improved the comfort level of the room.However...staying for an extended period at this hotel, I began to experience some unsettling occurances. About 3 or 4 times a week I received phone calls from the front desk telling me there was an alarm going off indicating there was a fire in my room, when there was absolutely nothing. I don't smoke, and I was not cooking.Also, at about the same frequency, I had maintenance men knocking on my door, sometimes early in the morning, telling me my front door lock was broken, and then telling me they were mistaken. I was constantly receiving these phone calls and notes under my door.These things happened again and again during my stay. Incidentally, I was a woman staying alone (young looking, etc), and did not appreciate the rather leering, disrespectful attitude from one of the men at reception and one of the maintenance men. I was surprised because I am used to the British being polite on the whole. However, this is the first time I have stayed in this neighborhood, as I always stay in the Kensignton/Knightsbridge area where I have not experienced this kind of behavior, at least not in hotels. Also, when I took a shower or bath, more often than not, the hot water would go off. So the plumbing is unpredictable.In general, the feeling I had there was bizarre, and I didn't feel absolutely safe and secure there."
96,632,"Jan 12 2007	Unplugged	I stayed at the hotel the second week in January 2007. The hotel is adequate for the money. However, they advertise free high-speed broadband in the room. There is a broadband modem in the room with lights blinking and everything, but it's not connected to anything. The free wifi in the lobby is too slow to be of any use. They ask for full payment for your stay when you check in. No posibilty to move once you figure out it's not what is advertised. The staff stays pretty busy making excuses and appologies."
97,632,"Nov 1 2006 	Great location OK rooms	This was my second time staying at the Citadines. Those looking for an excellent location (the heart of Trafalger Sq), will not be disappointed. It's easy to get to and is in walking distance of major attractions.The rooms are very clean. However, since it is an apartment style, they are slightly spartan. Don't be expecting any frills and attentive service here! While the staff is very friendly, they don't go quite to the same lengths as other hotels might for the price they charge.The good part is, each room has a kitchenette, which makes it very easy to keep breakfast items, snacks and drinks on hand. The rooms don't have any views to speak of though, and can feel a bit claustraphobic!"
98,632,"Oct 25 2006	Perfect Location!	A friend and I decided to spend a long weekend in London as we had both turned 40 this year, and as I had already stayed at a couple of Citadines hotels in France, we thought we'd give this one a try. It was the location that really swung it for me - out of all of the London branches, this has to be the best for reaching the majority of sights, shops, theatres and the river - all on foot. Having said that, there are two underground stations, lots of bus stops and a main railway station within two minutes walk if you want to go further afield.The hotel itself looked impressive from the outside and also in the lobby area, and the staff on reception were all very friendly and helpful. We were not sure when we turned up (about three hours before normal check-in time) if we would be able to have our room straight away, but it was no problem, so we were able to leave our luggage and get exploring. The room that we had (a one-bedroomed apartment that could sleep up to 4 people) was just the right size for the two of us, (a studio, for 2 people, would probably have been too cramped), and it was clean, even if it wasn't in tip-top decorative order. The kitchen was well-equipped, and there was a supermarket nearby for us to buy supplies, so this really helped save a bit of money (being able to make our own breakfast and a snack in the evening). This is the main advantage to staying here - you have the freedom to eat what you want, when you want, and I would really recommend it to families with small children, who often want to eat at times outside of the regular restaurant opening hours, and at a reasonable price. London isn't the cheapest city in the world!Overall, I think that anyone would have a good stay here. I would definitely go back again."
99,632,"Oct 10 2006 	Location locationlocation	On a recent visit to London our family chose to stay at the Citadines Trafalgar Square. We had previously stayed at Citadines in Brussels and Paris and were most impressed by their locations, the apartment concept and the flexibility this afforded a family. We were not let down by the Trafalgar Square Citadines. The location is excellent, so close to everything yet reasonably quiet especially when one considers you are so close to Charing Cross, Northumberland Street etc. The check in was so smooth as we arrived from Australia and had booked the extra night so that when we arrived at 6am our room was available...such a good idea for long haul travellers. The staff were excellent, the room was well appointed with small kitchen, bathroom and toilet and a bedroom with an extra bed in the family area. This was perfect for our family of three. I still have trouble with the strange location of light switches (this we found in the other Citadines we stayed at) and also the doors to bathrooms and toilet opening out into the hallway of the apartment..but they are just minor variations to the norm and nothing to worry about. There are 2 small supermarkets in Charing Cross Station itself which gave you good range of foods to select from and there was a Tescos about 600-750 metres away...which was also excellent. It took all of 2 minutes to walk to Trafalgar Square one way and 2 minutes walk the other way to be at the embankment...just excellent for sightseeing and definitely helped the foot sore tourist as you could return to your base for a rest and a drink before setting out to do more sightseeing in this amazing city. The beds were really comfortable even the pull out bed. Added bonus is the free internet which resided in the entrance area of the hotel, however it was out of commission one of the days we were there, minor inconvenience. The stay at the Citadines was excellent and as we chose to go to theatre on one of the nights we stayed, it was a very short and pleasant walk to the theatre. Most enjoyable stay and I will stay there again when next I visit London. Our family has stayed at other hotels in London and we found that this was definitely better than the previous, the star rating of this and other hotels never seems to be precise when compared with accommodation in Australia but Citadines was clean, tidy , great beds and had a good kitchen ."
100,632,"Oct 5 2006 	Fab location!!!!	Had a lovely stay at this hotel last weekend. We decided to drive to the hotel, and must admit the entrance to the car park was a bit hair-raising, as I was driving a 4x4!! But what a great location. Minutes walk to all the major attractions, which meant there was really no point in getting a travel card, unless you intend on going further out.Didn't utilise the kitchen facilities, but would be so much easier for a longer stay. Would recommend this place, especially to young families. No point having breakfast in the lobby - v expensive at 9 pp. Just buy out and eat in the room!"
101,632,"Aug 16 2006 	Loved It!!	I had arranged this ages beforehand because I knew my planned date is at peak time and was going to be very expensive. The price...I can't complain about! It was definately affordable (18 with no cash!). I got this via other website so venture around first!The location is amazing I must say, the hotel is situated less than 5 minutes away from trafalgar square and is the prime place situated near all convenient shops and restuarants.The studio room was very nice and modern. The bed is a pull out bed (this is in all studio rooms!) but I expected this after reading the reviews. To our suprise it was extremely comfortable for us, it was easy to pull out and back in. We did spend a lot of time in the room, though the room was not big it was enough for us with a very modern hifi and a colour TV. The air con was easily adjustable. Our room was situated on the third floor with the view at the front. The traffic was busy outside but this didn't bother our stay or our sleep.The kitchette was fully equipped to my suprise. It had everything that I needed, packed with all cutlery and plate/bowls ranges, toaster, stove, fridge/freezer, microwave, dishwasher, pots and pans etc. However one minor complaint about the kitchen was that there was a door stop but it was stuck to the tiles which meant that it was suffocating with the door closed. Although the kitchenette was small, we were able to make breakfast, lunch and dinner (with 3 course meals!) as everything was accessible and easy to use. The bathroom was very clean with marble tiling as well as the kitchenette. They supplied a range of towels and complimentary toileteries.I would recommend this to anyone because the price was affordable and with full use of the kitchenette and the food brought beforehand, it was definately worth the stay!"
102,632,"Aug 3 2006 	for the location and more	The good parts:The location can't be better. You can walk almost everywhere. It is quiet, at least we never been disturb by noise in our room at first floor but in the back of the hotel. The staff is nice and helpful. The apartment with one room was very well equiped and clean. It is not a large room but it is fine for 4 persons. (we were only there to sleep) The bad part is the price for the room without service. No change of towel, no clean up of the room everyday. (we've been there 6 nights) We already knew that but we still think it is expensive for what we got. The breakfast is also expensive but with the kitchenet, we eat in our room before starting the day.And if I can suggest something, it would be nice to have another computer for the customer. One is not enough for the size of the hotel."
103,632,"Jun 29 2006	Great location 	After having read the reviews I was skeptical that the service would be anything but spartan, quite the contrary - we had helpful people at the front desk that showed us how to get places. Also free Wifi access while you are staying is great.Breakfast - avoid the 9 pound per person breakfast and venture right towards Traflagar Square, when you get to the square look right and you will see a Cafe - my wife and I were able to get a full English breakfast there from a nice guy for 5 pounds each.Pharmacy - is located towards Trafalgar Square and then right - you will see it on the right, it's called &quot;Boots&quot;You simply cannot beat this location, it has everything right at our doorstep, for the price the room is simply unbeatable and will even do for upscale travellers."
104,632,"Jun 7 2006 	Just the job	I can only agree with what others have said about the excellent location of this hotel. I was travelling alone, and never felt uneasy or unsafe on my extremely pleasant summer evening walks around London and to and from this hotel. I was able to walk to pretty well everywhere I wanted to go within about 10-15 minutes, and there is an excellent selection of bars, restaurants and coffee shops very nearby.For breakfast, there is a Costa next to Embankment station (2 minutes away) and there is a pretty well stocked Tesco Express about a minute's walk away in the other direction.The studio was a fair size, and I think it would be perfect for 2 for a couple of nights, though you might get a bit stir crazy after any longer. The sofa bed was fairly heavy to pull out, but the chap from reception was up very quickly after I called and got everything sorted for me in no time at all. Bathroom fine, and everything was very clean. The kitchen was very good (though I only used the fridge), and the dishwasher was really dinky. It would have been nice if they had left the basics to make a cup of tea or coffee in the room, but no other complaints at all.I didn't try the breakfast as I could get similar for half the price a few minutes away. Recommended, would definitely stay here again."
105,632,"May 4 2006	Fantastic location	Nothing bad to say about this hotel, just nothing great either. The location is FANTASTIC. I lived in London for five years and was very impressed by Citadines' proximity to Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden -- all places I wanted to go. The staff was not the most helpful, but they weren't rude either. And I liked the free internet in the lobby (although it was ALWAYS in use). The room was really small -- but I think most London hotel rooms are small -- and the shower had absolutely no pressure, which is also typical in London. But the bathroom seemed new, and if you're staying for a few days, the kitchenette is great -- they had everything from a microwave and stovetop to an electric kettle."
106,632,"Apr 28 2006	Great Location	Location is wonderful 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square. We only stayed for one night for a theatre trip but as a base in London if you were staying a few days it would be perfect with fully equipped kitchenette and sofabed that gives you space to relax in the room when you get back to your room with sore feet. On the downside it is compact (most americans will hate it), the sofa bed is better than most sofa beds but obviously not as good as a proper bed. We will definately stay in a Citadines again."
107,632,"Apr 25 2006	only so-so	This was our second time staying at this particular Citadines and we wondered what it was that made us want to stay here again. Last time we had a one bedroom, which was serviceable for a family of 4. This time, we were a family of 5 (with a 70-year-old grandmother) and had booked a 2 bedroom. You should know that ALL of the 2 bedrooms are located on 2 floors, with a winding staircase linking both floors. The toilet is located downstairs and the shower and sink is located upstairs. If you need to use the toilet at night, it means going down a very steep, winding staircase in the dark - something none of us were comfortable with. The staff were very kind in changing our room, but the only other accommodations were much smaller. The location of this hotel is fabulous, but it truly is &quot;bare-bones.&quot; Although they offer a towel and linen change (for a charge which we were happy to pay), they were unable to handle our request for a linen change and very reluctantly gave us clean towels. The continental breakfast is 9 pounds per person. This hotel is worth it if you can get it for a bargain price, but otherwise it does not offer a good value. I personally can't imagine any family who would want the 2 bedroom as it is an extremely inconvenient set-up."
108,632,"Mar 27 2006	Wonderful Surprise!!	What a wonderful surprise!!! The location is AMAZING!!! You are literally a 2 minutes walk from Trafalgar Square  hard to beat that. The price was pretty amazing as well - very reasonable. My bedroom was great  with a nice view and it was very clean. I was a little bit concern about the sofa-bed, but do not be - it was great, comfortable and big  although I found a little tricky and heavy to open by myself, but if you have too much trouble the hotel staff will be glad to help you. Check-in and check-out was fast which I really appreciated. I had a great time at the Citadines and definitely will stay there again on my next trip to London."
109,632,"Mar 21 2006	Great location a few things left to be desired	I'm happy to report big improvements in staff and in room quality over last year. Staff was polite, cheerful, and helpful, and the room was brighter, cleaner, and more pleasant. All of the good things from last year -- the relative quietness of the rooms on noisy Northumberland Ave., the big bathroom, and well-equipped kitchen, were all still in evidence. With this in mind, I'd love to give this place another star, but I can't. Why, you may ask. I'll tell you: I had the bed from hell. In fact, I'd be willing to bet that the beds they have in hell are probably more comfy than the one I had. My standards are not particularly high, mind you. I know that the studios have sofabeds, and in the past I've found them acceptable, although certainly not the most comfortable. This bed, though, was not only uncomfortable but in bad repair (the mattress support panel would regularly fall through leaving in peril of falling through to the floor), and it bespeaks a certain lack of regard for the guests that the hotel would pass off this kind of Inquisitorial torture device as something acceptable to sleep on. Even with this unpleasant bed business, I find myself in awe of the location and the general value the hotel offers for the money. I just wish they didn't coast on the &quot;location&quot; angle so much, and tried a little bit harder."
110,632,"Feb 10 2006	Location Location Location	Stayed at the Citadines Trafalgar in October 2005, and enjoyed the stay. The hotel is located just steps away from Trafalgar Square, and just a little further from Piccaddily Circus. This eliminated the need to use public transport or taxi's. The apartments at Citadines were a bit average. We had opted for the more expensive option of a 2-floored apartment. This was money, we could have saved. I would recommend the Citadines to most people."
111,632,"Feb 2 2006	Ugh!	I stayed at the Citadines with my family in mid January, and after a 24 hour flight, was delighted to find that we were given our apartment immediately, at 8am. The hotel foyer is very pleasant, with a welcome computer with internet access, much to the delight of younger guests.However, the 2 bedroom unit was most uncomfortable. The toilet was downstairs, with no handbasin, and the kitchen-living area the most depressing space I could imagine. The carpet was badly stained and the pull out sofa so uncomfortable that we did not sit there to watch the tiny tv. Our upstairs bedrooms were better, but the beds were were rock hard and the bathroom minute, with a very high step into the bath. Oh yes, access to the bedrooms is via a very narrow spiral staircase. This is a place for the fit...As for the washing machines, they are ancient and take for ever. They are so small that we needed 2. However, the desk staff only charged for 1. In fact, we found the staff in general to be helpful, contrary to what others had written. And, very friendly people seem to stay at this hotel. The hotel is so central that I don't think we could have found a better location, but when relatives wanted to contact us, nobody answered the phone at the front desk. Callers were put on hold indefinitely. So, if you stay there, give out your direct number as soon as you arrive.There are excellent shops for groceries nearby, including a large Tesco and a M &amp; S foodhall. You will need them, as nothing is included: not even shampoo or a teabag. There are plenty of good cafes and restaurants nearby, and many main attractions are within walking distance. We felt safe and secure in the local area.Would we stay there again? I would search for something much better for the price. But from our experience of London, that may be a tall order."
112,632,"Dec 26 2005	Incredible location!	My wife and I stayed at this hotel in late June and were pleasantly surprised. Arriving from Heathrow Airport, we jumped off the Underground and made the two minute walk to the hotel. We were greeted by an extremely pleasant and helpful staff member who immediatley handed us a map of London. The staff member answered any and all questions we had before handing us our room keys.My wife and I headed up to our room via the very small elevators. With the two of us and our luggage, it was a tight fit! Because it was just the two of us, we decided to get the one bedroom studio. This room was just big enough for two people, so if there are more people in your party, you will need to get another type of room. Also important to note is the fact that the room has a fold-out sofa bed. Here's where the &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; part of the review comes in. The bed was actually quite comfortable. The kitchen part of the room was, like the rest of the room, small. But we found it quite adequate during our stay. Don't expect to be cooking large meals there, but again, there should only be two in this room! The kitchen, and the room in general, was spotlessly clean upon arrival.Now I come to the only bad part of this review. The bathroom. It was spotlessly clean as well, but the bathtub was a bit dangerous. It required a large step up to get into, and conversely, a awkward step down to get out of. I could see this as being extremely dangerous for anyone with mobility issues. I'm an extremely active 32 year old and I almost fell a few times.One other thing about the room, they don't change the linens for you. You can get this service, but it is at an additional cost. We were there four nights, so again, not an issue.Other than that, we were extremely satisfied with the room. We knew it was going to be small before we arrived, so this was not a surprise. Honestly, I didn't go to London to relax in my room, so this wasn't an issue. But I could see this being a problem for larger groups.Some other things to note; I would skip the breakfast at the hotel. It is overpriced and you can find better food within a two minute walk. And that is if you are walking very slowly. Also, the internet is free in the lobby, but expect a wait. There is only one computer available for your use. However, if you bring your own, they have another high speed connection available.By far the very best attribute of this hotel, other than the price, is the location. It really is in the middle of everything. As mentioned earlier, the Underground (Embankment Station) is two minutes away. Starbucks, if you are a coffee nut like me, is on the corner. Many pubs, including the Sherlock Holmes Pub, are within 100 feet of the hotel. Trafalgar Square is about five minutes away, as is shopping of all kinds. The theater district is about ten minutes away on foot. Buckingham Palace will take you about twenty minutes, but the walk is beautiful. The changing of the Horse Guard is about five minutes away. We left London by way of the Chunnel and again, with our baggage in tow, this was a fifteen minute beautiful walk across the Thames to the train station.In summary, this hotel gave us more than we expected. I expected budget accomodations that would be short on service, and I received excellent service and a comfortable, clean room. My wife and I would definately stay in this hotel again, and probably will someday!"
113,632,"Dec 14 2005 	Location was great but hotel was disappointing	On the positive side, the hotel was in a great location and the room was very clean with a nice bathroom. On the negative side, however, the bed was an uncomfortable pull-out couch, the hotel staff begrudgingly helped you, the card key for the room got deactivated every day causing us extra trips to the lobby where they would insist that the key worked when it did not, 3 lights blew out in the room and on one day the electricity in the whole room blew out, when we checked out they had NO record of our payment and we had to dig through our packed suitcases to find the receipt. My biggest complaint is the lack of services and the unfriendly staff. You're basically on your own here. I would not stay here again."
114,632,"Dec 7 2005	Absolutely Great location and not a bad price	We spent 9 days in late November at the Citadines, Trafalgar location, in London. The main attraction was the location, and you just can't find another hotel in this area in anywhere near this price range. You are 3 minutes walk from the Thames, Trafalgar, Parliament, and 10 minutes from Picadilli, Leicester, Covent Gardens, the theatre district. In addition, there are lots of pubs, cafes, restaurants, and even grocery stores close by. There are three kinds of rooms: studios (living room with couch that folds out to bed), one-bedroom, and two-bedroom. All rooms have tiny kitchenette and livingroom with fold-out sofa. The rooms are very small, but comfortable. They would be crowded if you had a lot of luggage, but worked OK for us. We rented the one-bedroom, and we stayed in the bedroom and had another adult in the living room. This arrangement worked ok, although the bathroom and door arrangements made privacy an issue. I think the arrangement would work better if there were children in the living room; I wouldn't do it again with adults! The toilet and bath/lavatory were in separate rooms, which was good. The rooms were very plain and the furniture was ''early married'', but the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen had whatever you needed for breakfast, snacks, etc. (which is useful considering how expensive London is). The staff was very courteous, and all our needs were tended to. The lobby is nice. Breakfast was too expensive for what was available, but there are loads of more interesting and cheaper options very close by."
