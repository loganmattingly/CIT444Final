31,2120,"Mar 4 2009 	Really oddly shaped rooms	Along with a very weird facade, the room layout for both rooms that we stayed in left me wondering whether the designer ever actually stayed at a hotel before. The exterior facade was just plain ugly and if you could imagine a building with acne, this building would be it. The hotel itself is on a triangular shaped block and in a great location in SF. It's very close to the Fisherman's Wharf and easily accessible to the cable cars and old time trolleys that run along the waterfront. Great Italian restaurants were within waking distance up Columbus Blvd."
32,2120,"Feb 26 2009 	Newly Renovated	My fiance and I stayed here for a brief weekend get-a-way and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel is currently undergoing renovation and while 1/2 of our floor was closed, it did not interfere with our stay (and we were one of the first occupants of a newly renovated room). This was an excellent location to move about town and see the sights. The service was that of a typical Marriott. Valet parking was pricey and we were able to easily find street parking (for free!)."
33,2120,"Feb 3 2009	Great location loved the bed	A friend booked us into the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf. Upon arrival, the doors of the car were opened for us, our bags removed from the trunk and the car whisked away into parking. There is only valet parking at this location with 24 hour in and out privileges.Check in was smooth and swift. Our room was located on the 5th floor. There was only one elevator working the entire time we were there due to renovations being made on the 3rd and 4th floors, but we never had a problem waiting long for one to arrive. While our view was mainly of the Hilton across the street, there was a lovely view of Coit Tower above it.The room contained a small coffee maker, water for $4.00 per bottle, an HDTV (with confusing and difficult menus to manipulate to get the channel desired), an iPod docking station/clock radio. a chair and foot rest, good sized desk area, small table, the standard nightstands and king sized bed. The bed was very comfortable. It had a featherbed mattress topper, down comforter, feather and synthetic pillows to choose from and a light blanket as well. The sheets were smooth and soft. There were several outlets in the room. Internet connections are available for a price, but one may print boarding passes at a dedicated terminal by the front desk for free which saved me a good deal of time at the airport.The bathroom toiletries are from Bath and Body Works and ours were an orange ginger scent. The shower had a large and tall shower head, but my friend felt the water pressure could be higher. The toilet had one of the loudest flushes either of us had ever heard from the other room, even with the door shut.For the most part the room was quiet. However, the doors to the rooms were hard to shut unless closed firmly, thus, one could hear doors shutting all up and down the halls. The ambient noise from outside was not overwhelming, but one could hear horns honking and traffic moving.The concierge, John, was a tremendous help. He called a few restaurants on a Saturday evening just after five trying to get us reservations. The place he suggested was Albona's in North Beach, just a few blocks away. He called and convinced their maitre 'd to get us in before their dinner rush began. We were able to walk right over, be seated and were treated quite well, in part because of John's assistance.The breakfast buffet was standard fare. The made to order omelets are the best thing about it! One of my sausage links was not cooked which was unpleasant. The coffee left a good deal to be desired. The fruit was fresh. The staff friendly.Overall, I would say the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. This property is in a great location - just a few minutes walk from Ghiradelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and North Beach and easy in and out for driving."
34,2120,"Dec 28 2008	No complaints whatsoever	We got a nice deal of $75/ night on Priceline. Going rate on hotel's website was $169. All the rooms are non-smoking. The room is a decent size, nice and clean with a coffeemaker, fridge, free newspaper everyday. The beds are the absolute most comfortable beds ever, even more comfortable than the 5-star beds we had in Vegas. It's not really a pillowtop bed, but they put a very comfy cushion that made it so so comfortable. The carpet is a little dated but not a dump. TV is old tube but we didn't care for it. Front desk was extremely helpful with our questions. You can print borading passes in the reception too. No internet in the room but you can connect downstairs in their email stations. Buffet was pricey at $20pp. Go next door at Denny's inside Holiday Inn for a cheaper breakfast. Location of this hotel is fine. If you are looking to stay at Fisherman's Wharf, I suggest you try Priceline so you'll get the best bang for your buck. All the hotels in this area (Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Hyatt, Radisson, Argonaut, Tuscann Inn etc.) are close and walkable to one another, so it doesn't matter which one you get. We ate at Sabella and Trattore, kinda like a local's place just beside Alioto restaurant . Food is cheap and great but general ambience is lacking and the area is filthy. Franciscan Restaurant just across is classy but expensive. The views are spectacular but the menu lacks lobster. We had the halibut and sturgeon and they were cooked to perfection. The best oyster we had was in the marketplace in the Ferry building where they give you a container and sell each piece for $1.50 and then you can sit down there and devour it. Freshest oyster we ever had! WE did this after taking the San Fran Comprehensive shuttle tour (highly recomended). Overall, San Francisco is very romantic, I would go there again in a heartbeat! I wouldn't mind staying at Marriott again!"
35,2120,"Nov 25 2008	Decent hotel	The Marriott is a good, decent choice in the Fisherman's Wharf area. The hotel is centrally located in the wharf, but away from the main street. Close enough to waterfront, but away from all of the noise. Also close to the cable car turnaround. The Fisherman's Wharf area is very touristy, with the atmosphere of a seaside town more than a big city. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are decent and clean, but, could definitely use some updating.While not the most luxurious hotel around, it is a solid choice and would recommend it if you get a reasonable price."
36,2120,"Nov 23 2008	OK hotel	Stayed 2 nights.Pros: location, clean large room.Cons: free internet only in the business center which has only 2 computers with a sign (15 minutes per guest only). No pool, no sauna, no whirlpool."
37,2120,"Nov 20 2008 	Well it's a place to stay	After a lengthy walk with luggage from our streetcar dropoff to the hotel (not knowing exactly how to get from point A to B), my wife and I dragged into the front lobby and up to the man behind the counter. &quot;He'll help you over there,&quot; he told us, and pointed to someone speaking to another young man. We stood at the ready, clutching our bags, tired, and then all three of them walked away and out of sight. I looked around, there was an older man sitting at a desk staring at his computer screen, obviously oblivious to guests. Thankfully, at this time a woman came out and started filling a cash register. She was human, told us she'd be right with us, and remarked about how everyone disappeared just now. As for the rest of the stay: The room is small but clean, a rather neutral place to spend time. The view out the window is of a bus stop and an office building, and one of the many local homeless. There are no amenities to the room save for the daily USA Today and the $4.50 bottle of water. You'll probably try to do what we did and buy a gallon of drinking water from the Walgreen's down the street. Don't- it tastes like melted plastic. We drank 2 of the $4.50 bottles in desperation. If you do buy, at least stick to the better stuff and avoid the Walgreen's brand. Anyway, back at the hotel, there is a coffee bar available in the morning downstairs, serving traditional Starbucks fare at traditional prices, tip jar intact. We didn't use the in house restaurant; instead opting for the known evil of Denny's located in the Holiday Inn a couple doors down, which was fairly expensive, as is basically everything at the Wharf. At checkout we saw that we'd been charged for a movie we supposedly ordered; we didn't, but maybe one of us mistakenly punched &quot;Buy.&quot; In any case the check out was nicer than the check in, and the nice lady (a different one than before) easily took the movie off.In summary: If I visited the Wharf again I probably would stay there once more, although I'd be willing to bet all the hotels are about the same and I'd be tempted to try something different. Not a bad experience, but not really a memorable one."
38,2120,"Nov 6 2008 	Great service adequate room	I was in San Fran for 5 days attending a conference and pretty much everything in the city was booked by the time I found out I was going there. So the rate I got here was $289 USD/night. If I had been paying that myself, I would probably have been disappointed, as this property isn't really up to par with the bigger urban Marriotts.The room was just average (and actually, come to think of it, a little noisy (my room was on the fifth floor, overlooking North Point Rd), but the bed was very comfy..The hotel is conveniently located for the Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach areas and the staff is great. The wired internet in the rooms is $12.95 per 24 hours and the speed is adequate.The front desk staff and the doormen were very friendly and efficient.I had to use the business centre a few times and it is open 24/7 an accessible with your room key. It's small, but the computers they have there are decent.I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant or use their fitness facilities.If you're into Indian food, just down Columbus Ave. is Kennedy's Irish Pub, which also has a full Indian food menu. Strange as it may sound, their food is really, really good. I ate it twice while I was there. They deliver."
39,2120,"Oct 25 2008 	BED BUGS	BED BUGS!I stayed at this hotel for a week for business, on Friday I realized i had bites. Since returning home I have had to disinfect everything. The hotel says they &quot;know how to detect&quot; bed bugs and they don't have any, my doctor says otherwise. This has been a horrible experience. I am constantly itching and the amount of time I have spent dedicated to cleaning and disifecting has been overwhelming. I am terrified I have now brought them into my home. The hotel has denied the existance of bed bugs, but I will never stay in this hotel again and go to San Francisco frequently. I would not stay here."
40,2120,"Oct 22 2008 	Can't Belive this has the Marriott name! Very Dissapointed!	The air conditioning unit in my room was extremley loud. I asked for it to be looked at while we were out. When we came back the unit was simply turned off. It was never looked at. As a result, we had an engineer in our room at 9:30 in the evening when we wanted to call it a night after a long day of touring wine country. The engineer told me he gets this complaint all the time, but there is nothing he can do to fix it. He told me I should just turn it off if I want it quiet to sleep. After he left, the wall unit actually fell out of the wall. He had to come back to push it back in. Niiice. The entire hotel is small and dirty. I stay at Marriotts to get away from these sort of dumpy conditions. I would have rather been a bit further away and had nicer accomodations. The real thing that makes me angry is that when I booked through the Marriott 800 number, I asked them which was better, this or the one on Nob Hill. They gave me no indication that this one was such a pit. It's actually rated as a catagory 6 by the Marriott company. There is NO WAY. Certainly not the way I wanted to surprise my husband with a romantic getaway. Spend a fortune, fly 5 hours. Arrive by limo and stay in a hole. What an enormous dissapointment."
41,2120,"Sep 22 2008 	Nice hotel for a quick business meeting.	Stayed at the Marriott San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf for a quick business meeting. This is a medium sized 4 story hotel that is between the Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach Areas. Small lobby, small bar area and a small sit down restaurant greet you when you check in. Check in was very efficient and quick. They have only two elevators and there is often a wait--catch them going down to go up! Stairs are not available for use between floors for some reason. Once you get up to your room there can be a bit of a walk to your room.Rooms are average sized--separate bathroom with shower-tub combo, bed, desk, table, chair. Minibar in room, no safe was available. Coffee maker available. I was on the third floor facing Columbus Ave. and was worried about the noise, but did not hear anything at night! Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable.Used the small gym which had a couple of flat screen TVs, a couple of treadmills, single elliptical and a single recumbent bike. A few machines and free weight sets were available. There are two laundry machines in the gym area. Fresh fruit and water were available. No one was staffing the room.Meeting rooms were good for our meeting. Rooms are downstairs from the lobby and they had connecting stairs.Food in the restaurant was OK. The food issue is not a big deal, if you are visiting San Francisco, you will always be eating out!Location is good given the proximity to the Fisherman's Wharf area and a few block walk to the Italian North Beach area. Concierge set us up with a local Italian restaurant--very nice place. If you take public transportation, the hotel is nearby bus routes.Valet parking is available--about $40 dollars a day. There is no self parking.Hotel was very busy when we were there--a combination of conventioneers and bus tour groups. The lobby and the elevators were the bottlenecks in the hotel.Would I stay here if I wasn't on a business trip? Probably not, can think of other places I would want to stay. But for a quick business trip it was OK."
42,2120,"Sep 10 2008 	not my best experience with marriott	Let me start of by saying I am a big fan of Marriott hotels but i think if the members of the board of marriott stayed at this hotel they would not let them call it &quot;Marriott&quot;. The front desk staff hardly responded when we checked in. Handed my room card and pointed towards the elevators did not smile or extend any welcome. The evening concerge acted like i was disturbing him when I asked for info about places to see in Napa.On the second night my daughter left a Tiffanys neckace in bathroom on returning she found it missing when we called the front desk they abruptly transfered me to housekeeping who replied they knew nothing about it. What a suprise! No one ever called to address this theft. Which brings me to the issue as to why there was not a safe avail in the room? And lastly the beds where old and very uncomfortable, so if you stay here expecting atleast the well know comfort of Marriotts beds your out of luck."
43,2120,"Aug 12 2008 	touristy but nice	We stayed at this hotel for three nights (August 3-6) Our room (469) was a nice king bed room - no view (looked out on the hotel across the street) but the bed was incredibly comfortable - featherbed - The room was clean and quiet. The daytime conceirge was a doll - he was so helpful, referred us to non-touristy restaurants. We asked for an authentic dim sum place in chinatown and he sent us to &quot;the place my relatives eat lunch&quot; it was great! The hotel is in perhaps the most touristy of neighborhoods, but it is convenient - we went to a SF Giants game and for $1.50, the bus was right outside the hotel..... the doorman had a taxi for us both nights within one minute when asked.... without paying $400 a night at one of the &quot;exclusive&quot; hotels in the city, this was a great place to stay and sleep!"
44,2120,"Aug 6 2008 	Overpriced and dirty	If you have a choice of where to stay in San Francisco, my advice would be not to stay at the Marriott. I stayed here for 3 nights and found the staff to be unfriendly &amp; inexperienced and the hotel generally dirty and outdated.Let me break it down for you.Front Desk &amp; Room Service: The front desk would not answer phone calls nor would room service. To place an order for room service you must leave a message detailing your order and wait for them to call back. On average it took about 30 minutes for room service to call back. When room service items were placed outside the room, they were not removed for days. You could see various plates with leftover food, bottles of wine, coffee cups and all sorts scattered throughout the hallways. This occured every day during my stay.Lobby Bar:Beware of the bar. On my last night at the Marriott I went down to the bar for drinks. There was only one bartender and she was clearly overwhelmed. She was not familiar with many cocktails and was surly with guests. I don't blame her, she should have had help. At one point she had to leave to get ingredients from the kitchen and the bar turned into a chaotic mess.For $300 a night, you would expect this hotel to be clean &amp; comfortable and the staff friendly &amp; experienced. When visiting SF again I will not be staying at this Marriott."
45,2120,"Jul 28 2008	Best beds in the world!	The softest, largest and most comfy bed in the world!"
46,2120,"Jul 25 2008 	A Super Stay	The friendly staff at the hotel (desk and concierge) helped to make this a memorable family stay for us. They gave us wonderful restaurant and sightseeing recommendations and for the restaurants they even helped us to make bookings. Our room was clean, quiet and comfortable. The location by the Fisherman's Wharf area and a short walking distance to North Beach make this an ideal reasonably priced hotel for tourists."
47,2120,"Jul 17 2008 	FABULOUS!!!!	The room was very nice...the bed was like a cloud with luxurious linens and LOTS of pillows. The toiletries were Bath &amp; Body Works. The in-room coffee was Starbucks. The tub, while not jetted, was rather deep. There was a hair dryer, iron, iPod docking station, internet ports, etc., etc. Anything you could have asked for in a perfect location to the Wharf and various bus/cable lines. The staff was very helpful and cheery. VERY well appointed and CLEAN for the extreme value we got through Priceline. Couldn't have been happier."
48,2120,Jul 8 2008	Totally Unremarkable	Nothing special about this hotel. My room (533) had adjoining rooms on both sides so I got to hear my neighbors well. Not a good strategy for trying to stay on east coast time during a short business tripI did enjoy my room service meal of San Francisco Clam Chowder in a Sourdough Bowl and the Fisherman's Wharf Cobb.
49,2120,"Jul 2 2008	What You Would Expect For the Area	This was pretty much what you expect for this area - overpriced accomodations with high cost parking. I was there 3 nights, and was not disturbed by any outside noise, which is a plus. I also liked the beds - very comfortable. The air unit and the frig in the room were very loud and should be replaced, as should the TV. As stated in other reviews, it's a bit dated. The bellhop was quite pushy on helping us with luggage. Overall, I'd try a different propertty if I have to stay in this area again."
50,2120,"Jun 21 2008 	Old ugly and overpriced!	I did not like this property. The lobby area was nice and the staff was courteous, but the rooms were SOO OLD and outdated!!! Not at all what I expected by pictures. I would recommend the holiday inn express down the street, it was newer and much nicer than the marriot. Very dissapointed with my stay for the price we paid."
51,2120,"Jun 2 2008	Ask for a Junior Suite	After staying at several SF Marriott properties in recent years, landed at this place for the first time after scoring a $100 room rate. Used my platinum status got me a Junior Suite, which was huge. The place was nice, bathroom looked a little dated. When I travel to SF I NEVER rent a car. It doesn't make sense as between trolley, BART and cabs, you can get around easier. If you don't like the spendy parking charge, well, DON'T DRIVE. Love the free breakfast buffett (another platinum perk) and the walking distance to all things on the Wharf and North Beach (an easier walk home than going up the hill). Anyway, I would stay here again in a heartbeat if the rate was right."
52,2120,"May 10 2008	great room with attentive staff and conciierge	I've stayed here several times and the location can't be beat for things to do. The room had several nice touches like a Tempurpedic type matress, nice linens and duvets. In room refrigerator and a window that opens were all nice touches. The concierge couldn't have been nicer and arranged Alcatraz tour tix on short notice. My only complaint was the brkfst buffet was pretty pricey, but there are some great local brkfst places close by the staff recommended. I stay in hotels about 3 weeks out of the month and this was a very nice hotel and furnishings."
53,2120,"May 7 2008 	Pleasantly surprised!!!	We didn't know what to expect after reading these reviews but we were very happy with our stay here. (Glad we picked Fisherman's Wharf location.) The room was a nice size, quiet, older, but clean. (Refrigerator would have been nice though) The hotel staff extemely helpful. We requested an early check-in (11am) and they did everything to make this possible, we checked in at 10am. Two nice breakfast places nearby, Buena Vista Cafe (YUM!) and favorite (the name escapes me..Mary's?) on corner of Columbus and Beach on the west side of Joseph Conrad Park. Public transportation so easy from here!!! A convenient Columbus St bus stop nearby (travels right to North Beach, Chinatown...), F-line around the corner (Pier 39, Ferry Building) and cable cars just a few blocks away (Union Square). Always easy to find our way back from every part of the city. Remember... not 5 star... we were not expecting it but were pleasantly surprised."
54,2120,"Apr 12 2008 	SF Marriott Fisherman's Wharf STINKS!!!!	I am so unsatisfied with this hotel that I could not wait another minute to write this review. First off, I called the hotel the previous night to confirm the payment and make sure the charges were to be on the specified card. When we got there, Michael (rude hotel staff member) told me in order to check in I would need the original credit card and photo id. The problem is my mother kindly agreed to pay for the stay. So we had to call my mother at work, have it faxed over and wait. Keep in mind we had to catch a alcatraz trip in 15 min. When I asked how to get there, I was told its 10 minutes walking distance. I said well ok that still doesnt tell me much? Then he said oh its pier 39. That type of short service is very typical of the staff here. Even when we got back from alcatraz I asked to speak to a manager (Alexander) which wasnt any better. When I told him of my unsatisfactory service he told me &quot;well now that your better and calmed down from earlier you should talk to our concierge staff to show you some stuff to do in san francisco. Yeah like I'm going to take advice from the unhelpful hotel staff. To top it off my mother called the night before check-out to say they charged her WAY too much. I spoke to another manager (from England) who told me in the most blatantly disrespect tone that he knows what he is talking about and my mother is wrong about what is being charged to the room. Now I think MY MOTHER KNOWS what she is talking about when it comes to what is being charged to her credit card. Its a shame I had to deal with this on my birthday weekend especially when I wanted to stay at the argonaut hotel instead but it was booked (for good reason). Avoid this hotel as it has the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!I wrote the previous posting the night before check-out thinking that was it but I was wrong. The morning of check-out I went to take a shower and was about a minute into doing so when the water from the shower head starting coming out in pulsating spurts which then turned to it spewing out YELLOW WATER. I immediately turned off the water and told my boyfriend to look as the water came out yellow (in addition to the faucet). We called the front desk who said they would send an engineer to fix the problem. Since we had plans for the day we told them we need to shower in another room. 30 minutes later a maid gave us a room key two floors down at the end of the hallway to shower. There was no explanations given or apologies for the inconvienience by the management whatsoever. Due to the ordeal we were unable to do what we had originally planned. I truly hope in writing this review others can be spared from theseexperiences."
55,2120,"Apr 7 2008 	Needs a major facelift	We stayed at this hotel using our Marriott points and chose between this property and the JW Marriott near Union Square (same amount of points). Being that we have stayed several times at the JW (Pan Pacific until a year or so ago), we chose to stay at Fisherman's Wharf for a change of pace. As soon as we walked into the room I wished we would have chose the JW. The lobby and lounge area were comfortable and well decorated, but as soon as you get off the elevator you see that the hotel could use a facelift. The carpet, furniture, bathroom counters/fixtures were are all very dated, and supposedly we were in a recently renovated room (I don't think so, or at least hope not). There were also dirty dishes left out in the hallway for about 6 hours at approx. 7 different rooms, even though housekeeping was on the floor for at least 3 of those hours. Housekeeping staff was also not very into customer service. No, I didnt complain about the dishes, or anything else for that matter, though they (3-4 women at different rooms), looked very unhappy and avoided eye contact. I found this unusual for a nicer property, where I am used to being greeted by staff (we were when we were downstairs). I would have gave them a friendly hello first had they even looked at usMaybe too harsh, but I am making this critique mostly for the hotel management who hopefully check these reviews. The pros for this hotel were the bed (feather duvet, pillows and mattress pad), friendly staff (except as noted), and proximity to Ghirardelli Square, Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. The lounge was also comfortable and service was excellent. For breakfast we chose room service (hung our order on the door the night prior), which arrived on time, just a bit cold, but was very good (California Omelet was fantastic). Our room service waitress was also very friendly, asking not only was there anything else for our meals we needed, but asked if she could answer any questions about the area or property. That was a much appreciated touch, even though we had no questions.All in all, until the rooms are upgraded, we would not stay here again. I gladly would have taken a cable car to Fishermans Wharf had I known the property was so dated. I know, I need to learn to heed the advice of other travelers in Tripadvisor, but being I was told the room was recently renovated I thought it would be fine...Oh well, we had a great trip regardless."
56,2120,Mar 31 2008	will return	WE could not have been more happy with our stay..we arrived by car and I asked the porter where to park and he gave me a detailed map and told me of a garage only 100 yards away. Check in was easy and pleasant and we were given an excellent room. The concierge was helpful and made good restaurant suggestions. I needed some fresh milk for my afternoon tea in my room and the helpful lady in the bar gave me some without any question. We had a couple of drinks there before going out..unfortunately there was a rowdy foursome hogging the fireplace so what with the pianist it was a little hard to hear..but it was fine. beds very comfortable...check out was easy.....Fisherman's Wharf itself has gone down hill...really to be avoided...but the farmer's market on Saturday morning at the Ferry terminal was incredible. We will return.
57,2120,"Mar 25 2008 	2.5 Star for 4 Star Price	Hmm, what to say about this Marriott? It's in a good location if you want to be near touristy sights--Fisherman's Wharf, Giradelli Square, Pier 39--but it is far away from the city center.Also, the hotel is badly in need of an upgrade. The rooms were decorated with wallpaper border and acoustic ceilings from the 70s. Walls were paper thin--we even heard our next door neighbors zipping their suitcases in the morning. Management was happy to move us after we complained about barking dogs at 8 a.m. Staff was friendly, but hotel is a bit shabby for the $200/nt price. Perhaps that's what it costs to stay in SF!We had a great dinner at One Market in the Embarcadero area. Food was very good, service was a bit suffocating, but overall, a 5 star experience."
58,2120,"Mar 16 2008 	Fantastic Time at Marriott Fisherman's Wharf!	Wow! My boyfriend and I just came back from a stay at the Mariott Fisherman's Wharf on Columbus Avenue. Location was convenient to all touristy attractions in the Wharf, and close to public transit and cable cars. The room was clean, comfortable and had a fridge (to keep all of your snacks). The bed was extremely comfortable--like sleeping on a cloud. I would try to buy some food for the room, as breakfast can be expensive in restaurants and at the hotel. The highlight of the trip was the concierge, I believe his name is John. He provided us with restaurant recommendations that were spot on to our interests and tastes, and always gave us great directions to attractions. I would highly recommend this location to anyone who wants an enjoyable stay in San Francisco."
59,2120,"Mar 16 2008 	Great location no concierge room normal rooms.	We stayed here for 5 nights the 1st of March. The hotel is clean and the rooms are clean. There is no concierge room. I think there were only 5 or 6 floors. It is shaped like a long triangle with courtyard in the middle. It is only 2 blocks off fishermans wharf, so that made it a great location. I would definately stay here again. There is a great breakfast place down the street. It is Pelaginos, I think. You get a coffee mug off the wall and get your own coffee (like 7 choices). There is a bike rental store right next to that for cruising."
60,2120,"Mar 15 2008	""Great location but expensive""	We visited this hotel as a gift from a very generous uncle. The hotel had the clean, high standard finish you would expect of any Marriot. The location is literally 2 minutes from fishermans wharf but the hotel doesnt benefit from any stunning views of the wharf or the golden gate bridge from any windows. It has an almost dwarfed apperance and in honesty looks more like a motel; It is only once inside you see the luxury. We had a hire car with us and were told there was no where to park in the vicinty and had no choice but to take advantage of the hotels garage which we thought would be free or at a discount at least for residents...but it actually cost 45 for 2 nights parking!! Our room cost alot and this on top was extortionate espcially as my partners uncle was paying for it I couldnt enjoy our stay as much thinking about it. On the upside our room was great and the bed very comfy but purly on extreme lack of value for money I would go else where next time."
61,2120,"Feb 16 2008	Marriotts have never disappointed me!	I just got back, had great Marriott service as I always do and would stay at this one again in a heartbeat. Great fitness center, free internet at the business center, friendly, friendly, helpful staff, very clean room, 5 star service in a 3-4 star hotel. Its also a stone's throw from the Wharf and not noisy. Price was good considering the location (I paid about $200 a night). The staff was always, always, ready to help me out."
62,2120,"Feb 10 2008 	Great Hotel	Fantastic location within walking distance to just about everything. Traveled out 4 miles by bus then walked back. Hotel concierge was very helpful in selecting dining locations and all were above expectations. Bedrooms were ample in size and comfort. Bed linens were fresh each day and the room tidy and restocked appropriately. Room service was fast and the food above average. Enjoyed the sitting area near the bar with the fireplace and &quot;table service&quot; from the bartender. Friendly staff. Excellent breakfast bar but a bit pricey. My husband and I would happily stay here again and recommend it to any traveler. One drawback was the significant walk from the elevator to our room. If walking is a problem, travelers should specifically ask for rooms closer to the elevator. But, that's a nit when you are away from home for vacation. Great hotel."
63,2120,"Feb 8 2008 	Highly Recommended	Great location, quiet area, with easy access to cable cars, buses, or street cars, and we walked a lot too. The staff was very nice across the board. The concierge gave GREAT recommendations on restaurants; he hit the mark 3 out of 3 times, exactly what we were looking for at the moment. We especially recommend the Steps of Rome Cafe on Columbus St. (next door to a sister restaurant, the Steps of Rome Trattoria which we hear is good also, but more expensive.)We also recommend the Pescatore Cafe, near the hotel, and also Alioto's on Fisherman's Wharf. We were delighted by the beautiful gardens on Alcatraz, the view of the city skyline from the now closed prison, boat trip over and back, and self-guided tour of the place. We also enjoyed the nearby dockside tour of the liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien, and submarine USS Pampanito. The Muir Woods (redwoods) site across the Golden Gate bridge was inspiring and also the Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen (Sonoma Valley), and their practice of sustainable and biodynamic farming, plus their fabulous guided tour and wine tasting. We rented a minivan right around the corner from the Marriott (Avis) for about $100 for the day, and drove to Muir Woods, Sonoma, and Glen Ellen, and ended the day watching the sun set over the Pacific from Golden Gate Park. Happy days."
64,2120,"Jan 28 2008 	It was okay...	The Fishermans Wharf Marriott was a typical Marriott. It was clean, had a fabulous bed, and a courteous staff, but it was definitely not a glamorous place to stay. That is probably a result of the location. I personally didnt care for the Fishermans Wharf area. It was dirty, commercial, and I didnt feel comfortable walking around by myself. Maybe it would be nicer in the summer and fall, but I would not recommend it in January. Overall, the hotel was nice, but I would not stay there again based on location. If you do have to stay in the Fishermans Wharf area, they did have a wine tasting on Wednesday night which was pretty fun!"
65,2120,"Jan 26 2008 	Good Hotel	The Hotel is well located and very clean. But they put us on a room facing the street. You could touch the window of our room from the side walk. Sometimes it was a bit noisy. Also the room was a bit small for 4 people. We were 2 adults and 2 kids.The concierge was very attentive and help us with directions and restaurant reservations.The parking price is ridiculous. But I think that is for all San Francisco the same.The overall is ok, but is not the best hotel we have stayed."
66,2120,"Jan 17 2008	New Years at the Marriott	My wife and I just spent 10 days in her home town(which she hasn't visited in more than 1/2 a century) of San Francisco at Marriott's Fisherman's Wharf. Weather aside our stay was excellent. The accomodations were better than expected. The room, on the 4th floor(of a 5 story facility), included a refrigerator, was clean and roomy. The bathroom was large and the shower worked well. The staff from the front desk, bellmen as well as the phone and housekeeping personnel were responsive and helpful. The concierge team(3 different individuals) were extraordinarily helpful.The in-house restaurant was a litle pricey but the breakfast buffet was excellent. The hotel was near 2 cable car routes as well as 3 buses that basically took us all over the city. We did not rent a car because, in part, parking at $40(+14%tax) for parking was outrageous. There were 2 supermarkets within 2 blocks which were able to meet all of our needs.By the way we are both light sleepers and I must say the rooms were quiet.I would recommend it."
67,2120,"Jan 11 2008 	A great stay!	We don't normally stay at such upmarket hotels but this was a very good price at the time.The lobby was very posh and so to were the lifts, ( elevators ).We had an excellent stay, in particular I found the staff in the lobby to be very curtious. We were always greeted on entry. The hotel's location is an excellent position within walking distance of all the attractions such as Pier 39, Alcatraz tour &amp; Sightseeing tour buses.The City &amp; Alcatraz tour bus picks up from the hotel.Some things were expensive such as items from the mini bar and bottled water but we didn't use any of these.We did have breakfast in the restaurant one morning and it was very good for the price. The chef in there was quite a character.Parking is also very expensive, as it is in all of Fisherman's Wharf. I think it was $38 per day + tips for valet only parking.Parking did not worry us however, as we parked our car in a multi story near Budget Hire on Beach road. It was expensive at $20 a day with no in out privalages but half the price of the hotel.The car park was about 10 mins walk away.I would certainly stay here again."
68,2120,"Jan 2 2008 	OK hotel with good location	A good location to Fisherman's Warf area is definitely the big plus of this hotel. The hotel itself is a big run down in areas. I found the staff hot or cold - some staff was really nice and helpful while others (like the omlete guy at the breakfast buffet and one of the front desk workers) were downright surly. Rooms are well equiped with coffee maker, robes, nice toiltries, iron and a TV. Daily internet charge is a pain and should be included in the price. Workout facilities were quite nice and clean. Daily valet parking was a bit steep at $40/day, but was reliable and fairly quick. The breakfast buffet was pretty low quality and uninspiiring (basic danish, toast, cereal, eggs, fruit, etc.) for the price and the variety did not change much daily which is a bit dull if you are staying a few nights. Not a bad hotel, but a bit low for Marriott standards."
69,2120,"Dec 20 2007 	Worst Service Ever	I'll start with the positives: this is a great location close to all San Francisco's best attractions. Within walking distance to convenience stores, museums, Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39, cable car stops, and downtown.My problem here was bad service which I complained about all the way to Marriott Corporate. Our entire stay, the front desk was manned maybe once the whole time. Had payment problems (not our problem, and not one we ever experienced at another Marriott) at check-in which were compounded by a rude clerk.Cell phones would not work in building, which was nobody's fault. But when our family tried to contact us by calling the hotel number, though, nobody would answer the phone to patch them through for our entire trip just about! We had a death of a friend while we were staying here... we did not know about it because our family could not get anyone at the hotel to answer the phone!!Had I not been interested in collecting my Marriott Rewards points, we would have got a refund and checked into the Holiday Inn across the street. We actually contemplated it, and talked to the Holiday Inn staff (who were much nicer) but decided to tough it out since it was just a 4-day trip.Not a fun anniversary though. I really LOVE Marriott  usually  but this property was horrendous simply because of the staff. Maybe it has changed since then, or was just an isolated string of coincidences, but I would not recommend this hotel based on my experience.This place was so bad, I even talked about it in a blog, LOLhttp://virtualbizweb.com/?p=23Just my two cents."
70,2120,"Dec 12 2007 	A lovely hotel	We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The room was very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The location is very convenient to many activities and San Franciscos famous modes of transportation. Although, you are able to walk to many places because of the convenient location. The consierge and many other employees were friendly and helpful. Upon returning to San Francisco we will certainly consider staying at this hotel again. Oh, the price was right also!"
71,2120,"Dec 11 2007	Fabulous Hotel	This hotel was really nice with a great location. The bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the fact that the hotel was completely non-smoking. The most enjoyable, however, was the concierge--John. He assisted us in booking all of our tours (6 total) and they were great. We were picked up in the lobby for all of them which was extremely convenient. We would definitely stay there again. We had a great time!!!"
72,2120,"Nov 28 2007 	Awesome hotel.	The only reason why I have not rated this hotel &quot;excellent&quot; is because it is not smack in the center of happening place. Living in this hotel you would definitely feel a much relaxed type of atmosphere. Don't expect it be like what you would see in a downtown area &quot;young kids roaming around till late&quot;. If you want the local culture feeling, I highly recommend you stay at Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of local little cafes around to eat breakfast/brunch/lunch. Hardly any bars around. However, walk to Little Italy (only few blocks) and you will find slew of strip clubs, resturants, and few bars. Chinatown is also right around the cornor from Little Italy. If you want the feeling of Michigan Ave area of Chicago, with high end stores around, stay at Union Square or downtown hotels. However, at Fisherman's Wharf, you will find enough street parking for FREE and won't have to pay the hotel so much money for parking. The breakfast at this hotel is not bad at all...good food, good price. If you get a nice server, she may even provide some food for free. She waived off part of the charge for our brunch. This hotel will literally provide you with town's map and draw your walking route for you. They are overly helpful and nice staff. I loved them all very much.The hotels service is definitely the best ever I have experienced. The concierge literally spent 1/2 hr with me on 2 occasions to help me figure out what I could do on my vaccation. He even looked up a resturant's menu for me (me being vegetarian) and called the resturant to make a reservation for me. The hotel carries free chargers for ton of cell phones so if you ever forget your charger, talk to them. I lost my camera in a cab on the trip and I had notified the hotel to see if I can check survialance tapes to track things down. The next morning literally all employees seemed to know and I became the celebrity."
73,2120,"Nov 6 2007 	Good Hotel	The room was clean, equipped with coffee maker, iron board, tv, internet access (their wireless business rate was $ 12.95/day), hairdryer in the bathroom etcThey have a breakfast buffet with everything from fresh fruit to toast, pastries, muffins, breakfast potatoes, eggs benedict, bacon, sausage etc etcIf you wanna spend some time near Fisherman's Wharf, it's ideally located, just two blocks away. To go downtown, you can catch the bus #30 (Stockton) across the street, which will drop you off exactly at the hotel entrance on your way back."
74,2120,Oct 27 2007 	loved the bedding	what can i say great bedding like sleeping on a cloud.excellent location everything on your doorstep.resonably priced would defineatly reccomend
75,2120,Oct 26 2007	Would recommend	A short walk from Fishermans Wharf. Very clean. Staff helpful. Some rooms can be noisy because they face the street otherwise the hotel was quiet. The beds are too soft because of the down pad they have on all of the Marriott beds now. We found that the mattress in the Napa Marriott was just right. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to San Francisco.
76,2120,"Oct 18 2007 	Great Service Great Location Comfy Beds!	We booked a one-night stay at the Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf using our Marriott rewards points. In previous experiences, I've had hotels and airlines treat me worse because I used points instead of dollars to pay for services and stays. This was definitely not the case here!We arrived at the hotel at 9:00 A.M. (seven hours before check-in time, which is 4:00 P.M.), hoping to drop our bags off with the bellman before doing some sight-seeing. Not only were we treated kindly by the woman at the front desk, but she found us a free room and let us check-in immediately, free of cost! When we told her we'd be leaving for the airport at 4:00 A.M. the next morning, she offered to let us pay our overnight parking in advance so we'd have one less thing to take care of when we checked out. Overnight parking was $40, which seemed steep, but it's less than the cost of the cab ride to the airport. The room was huge with a gigantic, super comfortable king-size bed, overflowing with pillows of all shapes and firmnesses. The second we lay down to relax for a moment, we never wanted to get up. The robes were comfortable enough that I nearly considered paying the $50 to take one home with me. Bathroom was very clean with a huge tub and all the amenities except for conditioner. Hotel employees were kind, giving us directions to everywhere we wanted to go. The valet parking guys were a bit slow to get the car, but not slow enough for us to complain about.We didn't have time to try the food, but ordered two Californian wine flights from room service ($13 each) and they were delivered promptly. The only negative about our stay was that we had to drag ourselves out of that amazingly comfy bed at 4:00 in the morning. I intend to find out who does their mattresses and look into getting one for my home!When we return to San Fran, we will definitely be returning to this hotel."
77,2120,"Oct 5 2007 	Lovely hotel but location wasn't right for us	We stayed at the Marriott for one night and chose the hotel for it's convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf and for our early morning trip to Alcatraz the next day. It was slightly disappointing on this front, as it was at the far end of the Wharf and in a dead end of the city.The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the room and bathroom were clean and well stocked. We found this hotel of slightly lower standard than the Marriott in Monterey that we'd stayed at the night before, but still it was very pleasant.Breakfast wasn't included but we ate there anyway. The food was of great quality and our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful.Overall, we liked the facilities of this hotel and would recommend it for that."
78,2120,"Oct 5 2007	Lovely Marriott	All is perfect here! Nice rooms, fast check in, clean hotel. Starbucks in the lobby, helpful business service, comfortable beds."
79,2120,Oct 3 2007 	Great first visit to San Francisco	It was our first visit to San Francisco and we arrived there for a 4 night stay after an 18 hour flight from Singapore.We found the staff helpful and efficient both at check in and in the dining room. Our room was clean and well appointed and had the most comfortable bed imaginable.The hotel was really well located for sightseeing and we were able to walk to many local attractions or else take public transport from outside the hotel.
80,2120,Oct 2 2007 	Ideal for our stay	We stayed here at the beginning of our two weeks in America (beginning of Sept) for three nights and again for one night at the end of our holiday. We found the room to be of the usual Marriott standard and the beds were very comfortable.We did not eat an evening meal in the hotel but found the breakfast to be very good unlike some other comments the fruit was lovely and found it to be the best in any hotel we stayed at.The staff were always helpful and polite. This was not the most up to date Marriott it is a little tired but you are not there for the decoration and it is ideally situated for sight seeing in San Francisco.I would reommend this hotel anytime.
81,2120,"Sep 13 2007 	Nightmare	I feel the hotel is not clean. I found a washcloth in my bathtub when I checked in. There was a gasoline kind of chemical odor in the carpets. It is non smoking hotel but the first room smelled like someone had been smoking. The air conditioning was turned offwhile we were out in spite a do not disturb sign on the door. I do not think it was on timer. The glasses in the room were starbucks paper cups instead of glass. The breakfast was $18.00 and it had low quality stale bread, slimy meats, slimy strawberries. When we asked for fresher fruit, the manager stated they saved the fresh fruit for pancakes....I was with another couple and they had the same experience .It was nothing like most Marriott hotels. I like Marriott hotels but this one is no longer inmy list of options."
82,2120,"Sep 10 2007 	enjoyable stay	Stayed at this hotel for three nights in July this year and was very impressed . Location is good for all fishermans wharf attractions,and for transport links to other parts of the city.Room was clean and reasonably sized with possibly the most comfortable pillows I have found in quite a while. I didn't use the restaurant,but it always looked fairly busy , and the menu and prices seemed o.k. Apart from a slightly snooty check-in desk clerk,the staff were all friendly and attentive.One slight negative was the charges for parking....bordering on the excessive in my opinion,but overall a very well run hotel and one which I would not hesitate to recommend to friends."
83,2120,"Sep 7 2007 	Very Good Hotel in Great Location	My family stayed for two nights in August at the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf at the start of our California trip. We arrived about noon and had easy check-in with the very courteous staff up front. Our room was small but clean and nice. The location is excellent, right near the Wharf and close to North Beach and Chinatown. Easy to walk everywhere if you enjoy exercise!The staff here was really great..friendly and professional. We were amazed at the international feel of the guests...it was fun to hear the different languages.The lounge area downstairs is nice...great bar with microbrews on tap and big screen TV.No pool or spa...only markdowns for that and rooms are a little small..otherwise a great place to stay!."
84,2120,Sep 3 2007 	Great Room - Awesome Location - Loved it!	This hotel is great! We wanted something close to the Fishermans Warf - and close to the Giants Ball Park (we were going to a game). We come to San Fran all the time - so we know the area well. This was a great experience. You can walk to Fisherman's Warf....takes about five minutes....and there is so much to do all around you. Great location....rooms were very nice....staff great and just a $10 cab ride to Union Square.....or you can take the trolly.Reccomend....no worries.
85,2120,"Aug 27 2007 	Great Stay	Stayed in the Marriott last year and loved it. After a 13 hour flight from Heathrow in to San Francisco, check in was a breeze and our room was ready straight away. Hotel was very clean, and we encountered no problems during our stay (14 nights). We found this to be a great base to explore Fishermans Wharf and San Francisco in general. Staff were extremely helpful. We found the concierge to be particularly nice, he suggested great restaurants, and pretty much arranged our car-rental for us, when we mentioned that we were interested in hiring a car for a few days. The only fault was the price of eating in the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel the first morning and were charged in excess of $30 for 2 omletettes for some juice etc. That was the last time we ate there, favouring the Denny's or I-Hop in Fishermans Wharf for breakfast from there on. All in all, a great stay in the San Francisco. Truly fell in love with the city! Would recomend the Marriott in a heartbeat!"
86,2120,"Aug 4 2007 	Enjoyed Our Stay!	We arrived around 12 noon. Though check in wasn't until 3 pm or so, there was no issue with early check in. The staff was courteous and friendly. The room was nice though a bit small. The beds were comfortable. The location couldn't be better- close enough to walk to fishermans wharf, far enough to be away from the noise. One incident: The electricty went off one evening while three of us were trying to get ready to go out. I contacted the desk person. It took a long time for them to answer and when she did, she was completely frazzled with no explanation. It was off for about an hour or longer then came back on. I am still unsure of what occurred. One more important detail: Parking is STEEP at the hotel @ $40 per night. However, it is difficult to park on the streets and alternate side street parking daily is enforced. If you have time to mess with it, it will save you some $.There is a great little bar down on Fishermans Wharf called Lou's Restaurant &amp; Blues Bar-- ask for Vince, great bartender. They also have a CD they are selling that is Awesome!"
87,2120,"Aug 1 2007 	The perfect place to stay in San Fran	Terrific hotel, spacious and very clean rooms, Very polite staff,and only a short walk to Fishermans Wharf.Front rooms tend to be a little noisy, but would highly recommend, and would stay here again."
88,2120,"Jul 27 2007 	Great staff recommendations- great location	This location has some of the best staff I have dealt with in a while. The front desk and concierge were VERY helpful in providing recommendations for nice dinners, quick bites, tours to take, and places to walk to. The hotel room was a bit more &quot;average&quot; than I expected, but it was still fairly large and clean. The bar area and the gift shop downstairs are both very nice. As you enter the lobby, you are overwhelmed with a wonderful smell of the huge fresh flower bouquet that adorns the marble table in the lobby. The hotel is within a shirt walking distance of several great restaurants, the Pier, and Ghiradelli square. Excellent location! And, of course, the Marriott beds always make for a wonderful night sleep. Parking was EXPENSIVE, but I guess that can be expected for parking in a downtown city where public transportation is the best way to get around. But, the valet guys were great. Every time I wanted to leave and drive somewhere, they had my car waiting for me before I even made it down the elevator. And, they are incredibly professional and polite. All in all, we had a great stay at this hotel!"
89,2120,"Jul 23 2007 	Marriott close to everything	The Marriott is located close to the heart of Fisherman's Wharf but is far enough away to allow some tranquility. There are numerous good restaurants close by and the public bus is right by the hotel.The rooms are a good size, in-room Starbucks, and appear to be reasonably priced by San Francisco's lofty standards."
90,2120,"Jul 5 2007 	Great Location Couple of Kinks	The location of this property couldn't be better for sightseeing around the wharf, Pier 39 and the Alcatraz Tour. The hotel is small and older but well maintained. Our room was clean and check-in was easy. The hotel advertised their new luxurious beds but they were a disappointment--much too soft for a good night's sleep. The only thing that would keep me from staying here again is the parking fee--a whopping $40 per day! The worst part is that there is a public parking lot one block north and two blocks east that only charges $6.00/ day. I really hate it when I feel that I have been taken advantage of like that. Shame on you, Marriott!"
91,2120,"Jun 24 2007 	no sheet - this hotel is almost perfect	I would have rated this hotel perfect except for one small detail -yes, they do have very comfortable pillow top beds but the hotel is using standard size sheets which are not large enough to accomodate the extra thickness of the pillow top mattress.The result is a sheet which keeps flipping off of the mattress corners, making for a very annoying nights sleep. On the positive side, the hotel was very nice with very helpful personnel at the front desk, clean and quiet rooms, and very close to all of the major attractions. If Marriott can correct this issue, this could be one of the best hotels in the Wharf area."
92,2120,"Jun 20 2007 	Loved the Marriott!!!	The Marriott Fisherman's Wharf has an excellent staff, great location and best of all - the most comfortable beds ever. My husband, 2 daugthers and I absolutely loved this place. We stayed June 8th and 9th. I would highly recommend this hotel when visiting San Francisco."
93,2120,"Jun 6 2007 	The most helpful staff	We stayed at the Fishermans Wharf Marriott April 24-29, 2007.To save on expenses four of us stayed in one room. The bedswere some of the most comfortable I have ever slept on. The concierge staff really helped us plan our stay, and gave us great advice on where to eat and some very fun nightlife. Kudos to all of the staff for their friendly, knowledgable advice. My only complaint was that on the last day I became quite sick. I stayed in while my friends did a Napa Valley tour. I wanted to order room service and found out that you may only order lunch between 12:00- 1:00. Now when I see a room service menu that boasts &quot;all day&quot; it should mean &quot;all day'. Other than this we all give this property a high rating. We would stay here again."
94,2120,"May 31 2007	Good Location Great Staff	We stayed at this hotel over the Memorial Day weekend, 4 days/3 nights, May 25-28, 2007. This hotel was in a good location with the Fisherman's Wharf attractions within walking distance as well as numerous other San Francisco attractions. All of the hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful but the cleanlinest of the hotel room needed improvement. Our room was nice but we noticed dirt on a wall and a stain on the chair. The shower curtain also had a stain. In the restaurant we noticed some dust along a shelf. I think the cleaning staff needs to be better trained. There's no pool in the hotel but we didn't miss it because of all the sightseeing we did around town and the cool temperatures in San Francisco. There was a small fitness center on-site which came in handy. I would say this was a decent 3 star hotel."
95,2120,"May 20 2007 	Nice stay near Fisherman's Wharf	We stayed at the Fisherman's Wharf Marriott for two nights at the beginning of our two week wedding adventure. It was a little further from Fisherman's Wharf that I thought, but it was still pretty close. The hotel was clean, the staff polite and helpful. They let us check in early which we really appreciated. Check in was quick and easy. The room was very far from the elevator which was nice because it was quiet, but it was a bit of a hike after a long day of walking around the city. They brought us extra towels minutes after we requested them. Great Bath and Body Works amenities in the bathroom. Really lousy water pressure in the shower. Fluffy feather bed on the bed - made me feel like I was sleeping on a cloud. My husband did not sleep well, but he really didn't sleep well the whole two week trip, so I don't want to attribute that to this bed. The sheets didnt quite fit the bed right - they should look into fixing that. Housekeeping did a good job cleaning. The breakfast buffet was ok. There was a good variety, but the quality was just average. It was incredibly over priced. Starbucks in the lobby bar in the morning was an excellent touch, even though there was a Starbucks in every direction, a block away. Trader Joes, Walgreens, Denny's - all 1 block away. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant for lunch or dinner. Outside of the hotel we of course spent a lot of time in Fisherman's Wharf. The crepes in the center were absolutely delicious - chocolate chips, strawberries and bananas. Yum! Check out the mini donuts at another stand too. A great treat! We had dinner at Hardrock Cafe which was better than I expected, and very short wait at 6:00. In the back is a Gallery - Rodney Lough Jr. Absolutely amazing wilderness photographs. Take a few minutes to look if you have the time. The upper level of the Wharf gets very little traffic, but there are some great shops up there. We spent a decent amount of time on Haight Street - the Pork Store is incredible for breakfast and lunch. If there are no tables, hop on a seat at the counter. The pancakes are unbelievable. Walked from the corner of Ashbury down to Goldn Gate Park. I wish we had more time to spend there. Got to see a really neat drum circle. Ameoba records is pretty cool on the corner before the park. We also did the Alcatraz tour. That was really enjoyable. It's so interesting over there. The day we left, we rented a car from the Hertz down the block from the hotel. The woman who helped us was a little crazy, but she was nice enough to us. Gave us great directions out of the city to Route 1. We were heading to Big Sur for our wedding ceremony. What a lovely drive. Overall we had a great two days in San Francisco and a great stay at the Fisherman's Wharf Marriott."
96,2120,"May 19 2007 	Great location!	We vacationed here for 6 days. We stayed in two adjoining rooms with our two children 12, and 8. the rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet. The refrigerators were hard to open and close the freezers were small and did not keep the leftover ice cream frozen. It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room to reheat leftovers and reheat coffee. We tried to find one in the hotel bar but there wasn't one there either. The furniture is dated but in good shape. We were close to many great attractions and the metro bus stop is just outside the hotel. The trolley is just a couple blocks away. We had a great breakfast at the hotel and kids were free. Near the hotel there were other great breakfast places that were also very good. We would definately stay here again."
97,2120,Apr 16 2007 	would definately stay there again	My family and I just spent the weekend there. We needed two rooms and the Marriott was able to give us connecting room. For some reasons other hotels find this to be a big issue. Anyway the rooms were very nice. The beds were awesome. Felt like you were sleeping on a cloud. The place was clean and the staff was very nice. The lobby has a nice lounge area which has a fireplace. It was nice to come in from the cold and walk in to a nice warm fireside. The location was perfect. There are 6 of us which made it hard to get one taxi. So we did a lot of walking. It was very easy access to the wharf . Overall a great place to stay.
98,2120,"Mar 31 2007 	Great location and great beds!	Very nice feather pillow-topped beds. Clean. Helpful staff. Great location. You can pretty much walk to anything or take the street cars or cable cars, etc. I contacted the hotel and ordered a car to pick us up and return us to the airport for a pretty reasonable price, but there is an airport shuttle that is cheaper or the BART if you don't have too much luggage. The food was good, but pretty pricey. There is a Denny's within a block and other chain restaurants so you don't have to eat the $14 pancakes. Food and drinks are pretty expensive in San Fran though so be prepared."
99,2120,Mar 19 2007 	nice rooms with a great staff	nothing but good things to say. nice clean spacious room with a very comfortable bed. my props to the personel dept...the entire hotel staff was head and shoulders above aveage. would not hesitate to stay again and to highly recommend.
100,2120,"Feb 3 2007	Loved the Marriott	We stayed at the marriott for 3 nights during our honeymoon and we found the location to be great! As mentioned by a few of the others who have reviewed this hotel, the bed was definitely the most comfortable bed we have slept on!!!!We found the place very convenient to get to the touristy areas. We took a midnight stroll to Ghirardelli Square for some Hot Fudge Sundae, and we found it perfectly safe to be roaming around the streets at that time.We definitely loved San Francisco and would stay in the marriott again."
101,2120,"Feb 2 2007	Spacious rooms Lush beds and helpful staff	We are not fans of Fisherman's Wharf and always choose Starwood over Marriot, but we completely enjoyed our short stay here. We live an hour out of town, but as my husband was a guest speaker, the sponsoring group booked the hotel. The rooms are spacious, quiet and the amenities (bath and body aromatherapy) are great. The beds aren't as good as the Westin, but if you want to stay in Fisherman's Wharf this is a great option on the almost luxury side. The hotel doesn't have any charachter and it is a shame not to enjoy the great old hotels downtown. It is a standard business hotel. For the money, the St. Francis, the Palace or any of the big old Union Square hotels are more fun and steps to great museums, shopping and restaurants. Also - for tourists, unless you have a car, it is a bother to get to fisherman's wharf. Parking is $35. Amtrak stops a mile away and BART is downtown. If you do have a car, always remember it is easier to get to Fisherman's wharf over the Golden Gate than 101/Bay Bridge."
102,2120,"Jan 10 2007 	Nice hotel good for tourists kids.	My husband and two children stayed here over Memorial Day Weekend. Hotel is a bit noisy--in a noisy location. But, buffet breakfast every morning was very good. Beds were wonderful. Kids had a good time...close to all tourist attractions."
103,2120,"Nov 16 2006 	I expected a little more from a Marriott	Now don't get me wrong. This hotel is in a great location, and it has a nice bar downstairs. The hotel is updated nicely. However, I always check the beds at hotels no matter where I stay. I pulled back the blankets &amp; found all kinds of hair in my bed, from pubic hair to head hair, and the sheets were a little stained. I immediately became disgusted &amp; called downstairs. The manager came up &amp; I showed him the bed. It was obvious that the bed had just been made &amp; the sheets had not been changed. So he took us to another room on the same floor. This room had the same problem, which I clearly showed him. He moved us again to another room, at which point I simply asked for clean sheets to be brought to our room &amp; I would make the bed myself. The clean sheets that were brought to our room had not hair on them, proving my point that the sheets had not been changed in the other rooms. The manager simply gave us 2 free breakfast tickets for the next morning. I thought that was kind of cheap of him. This was the Marriott which prides itself on service, and here the maids had not been changing the sheets, and I had to make my own bed. I was really dissapointed in the managers choice of compensation &amp; we haven't stayed at a marriot since. Customer Service is really important &amp; this manager seems to have forgotten that. Check your bed the next time you think about staying here."
104,2120,"Nov 5 2006 	OK for a one nighter	A one night stopover on business. Efficient and friendly check in. I got the impression this was more of a tourist hotel than the average Marriott - no surprises considering the location. The room was OK, comfy Marriott king size bed, although very small bathroom. Fantastic view of the Holiday Inn from my room! Room service was a slightly too slow and disorganised for my liking. Overall, clean and fair value for less than $200."
105,2120,"Oct 30 2006 	Can't beat the bed!!!	I stayed 3 nights in October for a conference at a nearby hotel.The exterior of the hotel is kind of drab and the lobby and halls show some signs of wear. However, at least for this hotel, the saying that you can't judge a book by it's cover holds true; the room was outstanding. I stayed in a basic room that had 2 queen beds since that was all that was left and I had a cheap (government) rate. It was easy to darken the room and the bed was extremely comfortable. I haven't slept so well in a hotel room bed in years! Starbucks coffee was provided free of charge, can't beat that. The bath amenities were also a nice touch.While it's not news to me, it still bothers me that most nice hotels ask for an additional fee for high speed internet access, and the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf does not buck this trend. It's one thing that would cause me to grade this hotel down.The hotel has a good location if you are going to be doing a lot of tourism activities or if you have a conference or other business to do in the Fisherman's Wharf area. If instead you have other business in San Francisco, I would consider staying downtown or near the Union Square area, as it's easier to reach other areas in SF from there. Still, it is easy to get to the cable cars and F street car line from the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf, it'll just take you longer to get places.I paid $140/night plus tax for the room and based on other hotels in San Francisco I would say this is quite fair. If you're asked to pay up to $200/night for this room, I'd say you've got a good deal. If the going rate is more than that, I'd say only stay here if your stay coincides with a peak time, such as a convention or other event."
106,2120,Sep 19 2006 	Can't beat the Marriott	I visit San Francisco several times a year on business. I always stay in Fisherman's Warf because I can get into the city in minutes. I discovered the Marriott Fisherman's Warf a couple of years ago. I'm never dissapointed here. It's a great location with many dining possibilities in the neighborhood. The hotel restaurant is also an excellent choice with resonable prices. The breakfast buffet is the best around. I travel frequently and actually look forward to staying here. I'm on an expense account but if I weren't I would object to the high price for parking your car at the hotel. I believe it was $43 with tax per day. It is a nice touch that they have a bottle of water in your car when they retrieve it for you.
107,2120,"Sep 11 2006 	Great stay! The beds are to die for!	We stayed Sat. Sept. 9th and Sun. Sept. 10. Relative is employee so we got a special rate, but cost aside. We had the most comfortable bed we have ever enjoyed on our travels.The room was on the corner of Jones and Bay and was a little noisy with the window open but once closed it was quiet. The room was very clean and comfortable. The Starbucks coffee in the room was a bonus score. The street car stop was a block and a half away and we took the street cars all day for $1.50 apiece. The hotel is only 2 blocks offof the wharf and there are great restaurants all around the hotel.We did not eat in the hotel, no report. The hotel in all was very nice and you could not have a more convenient location for sightseeing in San Francisco. We will stay again, with or without a discount!"
108,2120,"Sep 2 2006	Good deal great location	After consulting with TripAdvisor.com (as usual), I elected to stay at this Marriott location. There were some mixed reviews, but most pointed in favor of the hotel.I paid just over $200 per night and it was well worth it. The location was great, within walking distance to all that Fisherman's Wharf and that part of San Francisco has to offer. The price we paid included overnight parking at a savings of $8.00 per day off the usual rack rate. The rooms were clean, including the bathroom, and have very comfortable pillow top beds and comfy pillows, perfect after a day of walking to take in all the sites.We opted for breakfast at the nearby Denny's and the nearby IHOP, both clean with quick service and lots of food for the kids.Had dinner one night in the restaurant and it was ok; nothing to rave about but wasn't bad, either.I'd recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
109,2120,"Aug 25 2006	Good Hotel	Stayed at the Marriott for business, and overall this is a good this is a good hotel. The setup is a little strange though, and I would suggest requesting a room on a high floor. My room was right on the street, and it was a bit loud. The breakfast was very good, and the location is perfect for visiting FW. The rooms were clean and comfortable although they were a little on the small side. I would stay here again."
110,2120,"Aug 24 2006 	love that bed!	When I sat on the king-sized bed all I could say was, &quot;Ah!&quot; And every other time there after!!! We arrived early for check-in but our room was ready anyway. The concierge was helpful in getting us a nice Italian eatery in the North Beach area.Oh, man! That bed!!!"
111,2120,Aug 21 2006	a disgrace to Marriott	A poor example of a Marriott Hotel.Beware the front desk who are particularly rude and charmless. I asked to speak to the Manager and he has not had the couresy to contact me. So much for customer service.The hotel is tired. It is poorly located and lacks facilities.Unfortunately not much in a positive sense can be said about it. Its only redeeming feature is its breakfast.Do not stay at this hotel if you are used to the normal high Marriott standards. This hotel does not come remotely close to achieving them.
112,2120,"Aug 17 2006	Great location in San Francisco	My wife and I traveled to San Francisco and surrounding areas to celebrate our 25th anniversary. One of our stays - three nights - was at the Fisherman's Wharf Marriott.The location was great for us as we wanted to take in the wharf, Alcatraz, Chinatown and other close-by sights. Everything was within walking distance with the exception of Chinatown, but that is easy to get to with trolleys.The room was very nice. Not much of a view here as this hotel does not tower over the surrounding cityscape. Again, location was what attracted us to begin with.When we arrived we were greeted warmly and congratulated on our 25th anniversary (I had advised them of this special occasion prior to our arrival). The hotel lounge was having a wine tasting affair when we arrived, so we found a table and relaxed with great wine, cheese, crackers and grapes. One of the staff greeted us as well and made the early evening even more enjoyable with great conversation and suggestions for our visit to SF.On the second evening we were sent up a bottle of champagne and a dozen HUGE chocolate covered fresh strawberries! A wonderful gift from the staff that made the evening that much more enjoyable. Thanks! You guys know how to make a stay enjoyable!We ate breakfast every morning at the hotel and enjoyed the variety of foods available with fresh fruits, juices, pastries, bagels, eggs, made-to-order omlettes and great tasting coffee to start the day.Evenings we found restaurants around the area. Everyone has their own tastes. We ate a casual Mexican dinner at a place nearby the first night. The second we walked down to the wharf and put our name in (1 hour wait) at Scoma's. Great food, great location and view of the wharf. It would be nice if they updated the 1960's veneered wall paneling...maybe that's the ambience and I just don't get it. Not a cheap dinner, with a couple of glasses of wine each we hit $120.There were a number of other hotels around this area to choose. We are Marriott fans and this one does not disappoint. We would gladly stay here again."
113,2120,"Aug 8 2006 	Great hotel especially Breakfast!	We stayed here for about a week and thought it was very clean and the staff is very friendly. The breakfast buffet in the morning was great! Tons of food, great taste. Location is good within a decent walking distance to all touristy things. Great town, Great people."
114,2120,"Aug 1 2006	Loved the Marriott	We stayed at the Mariott Fisherman's Wharf on July 28th and 29th, 2006. We had a great room with two double beds. The beds were like sleeping on a cloud. Our room faced the street but the noise was not bad. The staff at the front desk was very friendly and very helpful. The bathroom products were from Bath &amp; Body works... my favorite. The hotel was walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and we did take advantage of the F Line bus that took us to the embarcadero. We took the Bart from SFO and when we reached the Embarcadero we took the F line towards our hotel and had to walk 1.5 blocks to our hotel. They have internet access. They have a buffet breakfast that we didn't take advantage of. We would definitely stay here again."
115,2120,"Jul 21 2006 	Memorable Stay	My girlfriend and I decided to book a trip for our Christmas present to each other. As she interned in San Francisco during college, we decided to head out there for some R&amp;R. As I usually make the travel plans, I choose this hotel based on the Marriot name, the excellent location, and the ambiance of the place. *Check In-No problems with check in. We got in around noon, and were easily checked in to our room. Each time we dealt with the front desk, they went above and beyond professional customer service to take care of us. *Room-The room more than suited our needs. Granted, we did not have the best view (The record store across the street), but the room was rather beautiful. As some may have read, the BEDS were probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in, including my own! I think they use plush down comforters, but I slept so beautifully each night.*Breakfast at the Restaurant-I live in Jersey City, across the Hudson from Manhattan. I know expensive places, and am accustomed to them. With that said, I also realize hotels jack up the prices of their food. However, the price of the breakfast was close to $30, quite expensive! Food was pretty good, but this was not the best value.*Bar-The bar was a nice place to relax, watch some sports and get a drink while my girlfriend got ready to go out. The drinks were somewhat expensive, but again, living in the NYC area, I am used to paying $5-7 for a Heineken. This was the same. Besides the pricing, it had a nice ambiance to it*Conceirge-Well, the good news of the trip was that I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiance! The night of the proposal, I wanted to take her to a nice restaurant. The conceirge was so helpful in getting us a nice romantic place to eat at. He was also excited for us. I work in a service oriented industry, where customer service makes or breaks a company. He certainly was very professional and courteous. He even remembered our engagement the next night he was working and congratulated us again!*Location-The location was pretty descent for us. Although my fiance is not into staying in touristy areas, she did enjoy the location of our hotel, as it was close to alot of places and/or public transportation. It was not too far from Fisherman's Wharf, and was a quiet part of town. The only downside to Fisherman's Wharf was the overpriced restuarants serving breakfast. Living in NYC, breakfast is cheap, even in a Manhattan diner. However, here, could not find french toast for less than $10-12. *ParkingWe flew out and took a taxi to the hotel from SFO, so we did not have to pay for parking. However, I did see it was rather expensive, so I would advise not parking in their lot. *OVERALL-This place met all our needs. They were courteous, the beds were extremely comfortable, and you cannot beat the location. I would definitely reccommend this hotel to someone traveling to Fisherman's Wharf!!"
116,2120,"Jul 8 2006	Had a great stay	My wife and I stayed for 5 nights at this hotel and had no real problems. The rooms are a reasonable size and the bed was unbelievably comfortable so we had a good nights sleep ready for the next days walking. The only criticism I have was the attitude of some of the restaurant staff and who provided a second rate service. The hotel is positioned only a couple of blocks from the heart of Fisherman's Wharf close to lots of restaurants and bars and made the ideal base.Car parking is expensive at 39 dollars a night, we parked on the street but had to change sides each night for the street cleaning which was a pain but a lot cheaper.We would certainly stay here again."
117,2120,"Jun 18 2006	Great Stay	Just came back from a three day/two night weekend Reward (i.e. free via points) stay here. The top three things were 1) Great Bed! 2) Customer Service and 3) Location. Although I usually don't pay attention too much to Customer Service (even in reading other reviews) since it can vary so wildly depending on who you interact with or &quot;the day&quot; that particular person is having, I'd have to say it was beyond excellent on all counts. We chose this hotel because they were the only Marriott that was dog friendly and the staff was not only attentive and cordial, but they actually seemed to take a lot pride in their job. And it shows. The King Bed was beyond superb and the location was right in the mix of a lot of tourist attractions. I am a CA native so I rated the location #3 as the Wharf area is a bit &quot;junky&quot; in spots, but more than acceptable.We ordered room service one night and the &quot;North Beach Pannini&quot; was excellent. The bar in the lobby was a bit quiet but had a lot of atmosphere going for it and we enjoyed it.If you can, try to get up early one morning (we did it about 7am) and take a walk to and through the Wharf. The sun rising over the barking seals nearby with almost no tourists around was really something to see. The crowds can get crazy anytime after 10am until ??? and the peacefulness of strolling along the docks and shops is well worth it even if you don't bother to take a shower to ensure an early morning start."
118,2120,"Jun 14 2006	Perfect Stay	My husband and I stayed at this hotel during the first week on June. The service was great. The rooms and the beds were amazing. From this hotel it is only two blocks to the Fisherman's Wharf, where there is so much to do and see. The hotel even provided us with complimentary breakfast since we are silver status guest. Only issue that we had was parking. It was $38.00 + tax per night! But as this is San Francisco what can you say? I would definately recommend this to anyone considering staying around the Wharf."
119,2120,"Jun 7 2006	Great location but some rooms are very noisy	This hotel is located a couple of blocks from Fisherman's Wharf so it was an easy stroll to where the action is. It's not a particularly smart place but the room was clean and tidy (as are the vast majority of Marriott properties in my experience). The only real problem we had is that the first room we were given was next to the ice machine and it was unbearably noisy. The staff were very quick to respond to our request to move rooms (although they didn't appear at all surprised so this may be a common problem). We were offered a couple of alternatives and settle on a room one floor below. Shortly after we had settled in, the concierge appeared at our door with gifts for our son by way of an apology for him getting to bed so late (not that he minded too much!) Full marks for customer service but this room had a very noisy refrigerator so it wasn't too much of an improvement!"
120,2120,"Jun 4 2006	Good Location	Easy to find, convenient to Fishermans Wharf. Rooms fine,breakfast above average although when the bowl of strawberries was empty they wouldn't replace it for twenty minutes - I think they had a set number of bowls per day and that was it. Staff generally helpful and courteous. Would recommend."
121,2120,"May 3 2006	A Perfect SF Spot to Stay	Since we have a son who goes to the San Francisco Art Institute, we try to get to the city several times a year, always booking a package (flight &amp; hotel) on Expedia. Easter weekend we stayed at the Marriot located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. It was outstanding! Wonderful rooms with featherbeds (VERY quiet), great fitness center(with fruit for the taking), cool lobby lounge, a Starbucks booth (coffee maker in the room, too), incredibly friendly staff and an easy walk to Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach restaurants, and the cable car lines. For snacks &amp; munchies, there's a Trader Joe's 2 blocks away. From now on, THIS is our home away from home in SF!"
122,2120,May 1 2006	Absolutely Wonderful Stay	I loved our time at the Marriot in Fisherman's Wharf. The location was excellent -- close to everything. The staff was incredibly helpful. We often had to ask for directions and they were more than willing to provide us with them. Our room was very nice. It was clean and the beds were especially comfortable. The bath room was on the small side but very neat and clean. We didn't go to the resturant in the hotel because it was it a bit pricey. We defintely enjoyed our stay in San Francisco more than we would have if we have gone to another hotel. I would stay at the Marriot in Fisherman's Wharf the next time I go to San Francisco.
123,2120,"Apr 29 2006	Super location	Often stay at the downtown Marriott - which as an awesome club up over the city. This time I had family along that wanted to visit the city overall.This is a super location to: Walk to the Hyde St. trolly - [midweek ~ 1 hr wait though ! :-( ] which goes all the way down to Union Square and the convention center, walk to fisherman's wharf and dozens of good restauraunts. Parking - very convenient in a garage next door at a REASONABLE overnight price.But the best thing is - very little local street traffic - it was easy to get in and out of parking, zip over to Golden Gate park, get on the 101 to the Golden Gate Bridge - or even drive up over Lombard hill.We had the best 'tourist' visit to SF of dozens of trips I've made there.The hotel was very acceptible on price, room amenities, and free broadband. I'd stay there for business in a heartbeat.I do agree that it's not as 'spectacular' a property as many full service Marriott's but the location made up for it!"
124,2120,"Apr 28 2006 	Not the best Marriott (more like coutyard property)	I was in town for business and styed at Marriott Fisherman's Wharf because the other Marriott in downtown was sold out. I should have just stayed at another hotel in a different location. This place was not up to par. It had a marriott courtyard/holiday inn feel. Eyerything about this place was old and outdated. The chairs in the lobby was worn out and stained. My room was very noisy, heard the traffic noise all through the night and the heater smelled like milldew so I kept it off. The room was on the small side and the bathroom was especially small. The bath products were nice (from bed bath). The bedding looked new and clean but found the bed to be too soft. The gym was small and had old star trac equipments."
125,2120,"Apr 22 2006	Good Hotel Great Beds Superior Location	Hotel has all of the normal attributes you'd expect of a Marriott except there is no pool. Nice rooms, clean surroundings and a fine restaurant. The location is the key to this hotel. It is very close to the Wharf, Cable Cars lines, bus lines and area attractions. Other comparable hotels in the area to compare against are a Sheraton, a Hilton and a Hyatt. All are within a block or two of each other. There are also second tier chains in the same area (i.e. Holiday Inn). We stayed over spring break and Easter and had a terrific time. The beds are outstanding. If you are going to Alcatraz, be sure to book your tickets in advance. The only ferry that lets you off on the island to explore is ----. We ran into a couple who bought at the ticket window and were told it was sold out but that they could purchase a costly tour that would take them on the same ferry but also included other destinations they were not interested in. We stayed a week and were totally pleased. The front desk staff and concierge were helpful in suggesting activities each day. You may also want to call the concierge before you leave on your trip to ask any questions you may have. I found this particularly helpful in getting the right transportation from the airport to the hotel."
126,2120,Apr 17 2006	Great location	We stayed at the Marriott for 4 nights and were very pleased with the hotel. It is in a brilliant location to explore Fisherman's Wharf and near to bus stops and tram stops making exploring the rest of San Francisco easy. The beds were extremely comfortable as was the rest of the hotel. It had a relaxed feel and we felt at home there straight away. I would definately stay there again.
127,2120,"Apr 16 2006	Absolutly Excellent Experience	Where can I begin?!! The Marriott Fishermans Wharf is located within a block of the Fishermans Wharf and is walkable to Gheradeli Square, Pier 39, Wharf Restaurants and the northern Embarcadaro. The hotel is older, and has a 70's archatecture design, but is very up to date inside. The staff is fabulous and will do anything to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are fairly large for being in a large city. The hotel has a great business center and health club and has a Starbucks branch inside. The hotels restaurant has fairly good breakfast's and offers dinners at a fairly inflated price. Obviously, everything is extremly expensive in California in general, but is a little more at the hotel (i.e. parking $38, 2 starbucks and 2 scones $12, breakfast buffet $18) but overlooking the cost, the city is absoluly gorgous and the staff at Marriott Fishermans Wharf is likly to please you as they did me...."
128,2120,"Apr 11 2006	Nice Hotel	Spent 7 nights here,second week in April 2005.Great holiday arranged with Expedia.Rooms warm,quiet and beds extremely comfortable.This is our second Marriot visit[the other being Marriot at Brooklyn Bridge}On both ocassions we found the beds so comfortable we were sorry to leave them at the end of the week.The great thing about the hotel is the location.It is actually a few blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf and non the worse for that.It is right next to the 30 and 47 bus stops which will get you anywhere interesting even though you may have to change.The bus system is brilliantly simple and very cheap.By far the best way to get around.The concierges were helpful and polite as were all the staff.Apart from the obvious trips and excursions around San Fransico we also went to Yosemite and Monteray /Carmel.Yosemite is awe inspiring and well worth the expensive fare and lenghth of day out{14 hours}.The driver Walter was a real card,maybe not to everyone's taste, but definitly a character.Not to sure about Carmel and Monteray.The only inspirational part of the journey was between Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz.After that the scenery deteriorates.Witness the ugly power station and pylons at one end of Monteray bay.Monteray is a hell hole of touristy shops and attractions.My advice,walk the opposite way from the crowds and head south along the water front.17 mile drive will impres you if you are inspired by golf courses and rich folks' homes.If not you may be in for a disapointment.The beach at Carmel is nice and I would advise you to head straight there unless you are turned on by shops.We would have had a better day on the Murin peninsula or Cliff house and Lands end.The latter would have only cost 3 dollars on thje bus.Eat out in China town.Great value for money and walkable from Hotel or take the 30 bus.Wonderful holiday.I left my heart in San Fransisco as well as the most comfy beds in the West."
129,2120,"Mar 21 2006	Great Hotel	Recently stayed at the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the room was very clean. The beds were to die for, they were so comfortable and fluffy. They were nice to sink into after a long day of walking and sightseeing. I was also very impressed that the hotel was completely non-smoking. How refreshing.The lobby was also very cozy with a fire burning in the fireplace. I had read other reviews that said the lobby was outdated, but I did not think so. It was very nice."

Good food excellent help from the Concierge, very easy to get around San Fran form here. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a bit of luxury. Keep up the good work to all at the Marriott"
131,2120,"Mar 2 2006	Enjoyed this hotel - great location	My husband and I stayed at the Marriott in Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights in Feb. We had wanted to stay at the downtown Marriott (since we were staying on Marriott points) but it was not available. We were very pleased with the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf.The hotel is in a great location for tourists. Steps away from great food, entertainment, shopping, and all of the tour companies. We were able to walk or take public transportation everywhere within San Fran.The hotel staff was so friendly (Margie in the dining room was so nice) - and the concierge (Mike) was super helpful. They really went out of their way to help.The hotel is small and lacks that &quot;big city Marriott feel&quot; and the shape of it is odd. Since it only has 4 or 5 floors, you can hear noise on the street level. The bed may have been the most comfortable bed that I have EVER slept in!We didn't eat much in the hotel - except for breakfast - it was a nice buffett for a hotel.Overall, we had a great time! We recommend this hotel!"
132,2120,"Feb 21 2006	Great place to stay	Our stay at this hotel was very comfortable. The staff was always polite and helpful and more than willing to help with any arrangements you may need. Our room was above average and the bed was fantastic. The whole hotel was very clean. If you stay during the week they offer a free limo service into the business district in the morning. We missed out on this opportunity because we slept in, but it was a nice bonus if you are up in time. We did manage to take advantage of the free internet in the business center to confirm our return flight. That was a nice addition to the stay. The location of the hotel is only two blocks to fisherman's wharf and not too far from north beach. My one and only complaint was that we had a very close view of the tree outside and that was about it. So I recommend that you ask for a room on the fourth or fifth level. Other than that one complaint our stay was smooth and uneventfull, just how we like it:)."
133,2120,"Feb 21 2006	Great Location	My husband and I just returned from a 3 day trip to San Francisco. We stayed at the Marriott at Fisherman's Wharf for the whole trip and loved it! The location was great! I'd been to San Francisco before and knew renting a car was a bad idea (minimal parking and &gt;$30/night to park at hotel) so staying at a hotel convenient to the sights was key. We requested a non-smoking king room, but were informed they couldn't guarantee the king part When we arrived all they had left were rooms with 2 doubles, but I believe it is a non smoking hotel, which was really nice. The beds were VERY comfortable. Down pillows and comforters, room darkening shades - all key for a good night sleep after a day of touring. I wasn't expecting much of a &quot;view&quot; from our 4th floor room, but surprisingly we could see the bay and golden gate bridge. The starbucks coffee in the room was nice. I heard the hotel restaurant was good, but we only got a couple pieces of fruit from the breakfast buffet. Which cost us $3.50 - ouch. The hotel concierge was very helpful. We spoke with him every day and he gave great advice and plenty of maps of the city and wine country.Overall, staying at this hotel really helped to make our stay in San Francisco memorable due to the convenient location to Fisherman's Wharf, restaurants, Lombard Street, Ghiradelli - walking distance to EVERYTHING!"
134,2120,"Dec 20 2005	Not the worst but not the best hotel in San Francisco	I purchased 1 night at this hotel for $75.00/night through priceline.This hotel needs some desparate renovations. It looks very outdated. The lobby wasn't well lit, neither were the hallways.Our room had sticky carpet and didn't feel clean, neither did the comforter/blankets. The alarm clock was dusty and looked like it was from the early 90s. It was very difficult to walk around in the room since it was crowded.Parking in the garage was $25/night (you pay that for parking almost in most hotels in San Francisco).I didn't get a warm fuzzy sensation or happy feeling staying at this hotel and I didn't feel like it was worth my money."
135,2120,"Dec 14 2005	Nice Hotel great Location	I stayed at this hotel on a business trip earlier this month. It is in a great location with lots of things to do and see within walking distance. The cable car turnaround is about a block and a half away from the hotel. It can take you up to Chinatown or other places. The only bad thing about the hotel is that it is not a high rise but very spread out and in a triangle shape. There is only one set of elevators in one &quot;corner&quot; of the triangle. My room was on the opposite side so there was a lot of walking from the room to the elevator. This may not normally be a big deal to you, but I was at a seminar and when we have breaks, I like to go to my room and check messages, freshen up, etc. But with it being such a long walk, it was time to start back by the time I got to my room. My only meal at the hotel was room service. Seafood gumbo in a sourdough bread bowl. It was pretty good. From the wharf a couple of blocks away, you can see the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges. It is a beautiful place."
136,2120,"Dec 14 2005	Fantastic time was enjoyed	I Arrived at the hotel from the airport via a shuttle bus service, no problem. We had flown over from England, so we were a bit tired, even though it was only 7 PM local time, to us it was 3 in the morning. We stayed up for as long as we could but gave in at 9PM. I must say I had the best nights sleep I had had in a long time the bed was sooo comfortable. Got up early the next day and started to explore, the hotel is very well situated for all the touristy things at Fishermans wharf and the bus and tram services were all close by as well. We did everything that tourist do, Alcatraz (close by) Biked the bridge(close by) Lombard street (close by). We also went to Cobbs comedy club which is just up the street from the hotel. We ordered room service a couple of times, which was excellent. Overall I would say, a quality hotel in a quality location, in a quality city."
137,2120,"Dec 3 2005	Some Glitches in the Execution	If I had written this review after our first night's stay, I would have been livid. Since our second night was immensely better, our stay averages out to, well, average.I was travelling with two teens. I reserved a room with two double beds. When I arrived, they told me no, I had reserved a room with one king-size bed. I pointed at the two kids and said, &quot;Well, we have THREE people here.&quot; They offered us a rollaway bed that she magnanimously said they'd comp. I later checked my confirmation e-mail. It did indeed say I was guaranteed two double beds. Luckily, my daughter wasn't picky and was fine with the rollaway. My younger daughter and I luxuriated on what has to be one of the comfiest beds on the planet. The Marriott offers featherbeds and down comforters -- perfect for chilly San Francisco.About 9pm, I heard the people in the next room fumbling with the lock of the connecting door. Twenty minutes later, smoke started filling our non-smoking room. The smell was clearly wafting in via a draft coming through the connecting door. The roomservice gal smelled it, and said it was worse in the hallway. I called customer service, they said they'd call the room next door and remind them that they were in a non-smoking room, and to call again if the problem continued. The smell soon subsided, and we eventually went to bed.At 3am, I was awakened by loud noises (party-like) next door and my room was filling with smoke again. The phone doesn't have a &quot;front desk&quot; button and apparently &quot;customer service&quot; isn't staffed at 3am. The phone rang and rang. I dressed, went down to the first floor, and complained about the smoke (which physically makes me ill). The front desk staff called the other room, but I would have appreciated some conciliatory noises like &quot;gee, sorry that you had to go through this.&quot; It took another half-hour for the extra people in the other room to go home, and for the smoke to dissipate. By this time, I was wide awake and too upset to get back to sleep. The next morning, I called Customer Service yet again to ask if the party next door was staying over another night. If so, I wanted to be moved. I got the puzzling reply that they had checked out. Since they'd been wide awake and noisy at 3:30am, I was darned surprised that they'd be awake enough to check out by 7am. Besides, the &quot;privacy&quot; notice was still on the door. I assumed they knew what they were talking about, and we all went out sightseeing.Somewhere around 2 or 3pm, we returned. Our room was smoky again. I asked for, and received, a transfer to a new room -- this time, one with the two double beds I had asked for in the first place. This time, the front desk staff was suitably sympathetic. We had to walk 3-4 rooms down the hallway before we left the smoky miasma behind. Luckily, our new room smelled fresh and sweet. A burned-out light bulb in our bed lamp was taken care of in minutes. Our second night was heavenly, and I took back all the bad things I said about the Marriott the night before.We were on the 5th floor, and didn't hear a bit of traffic with the windows closed. The concierges were extremely helpful regarding sightseeing: they recommended the best dim sum place in Chinatown, and advised me on the best time of day to catch a cable car without waiting in line. They were pure gold.If you check the Marriott website, you can get a better deal than Expedia or Orbitz. The normal rate for Thanksgiving weekend was $150/night plus $38/night for parking. I got a deal for $170/night on the Marriott website, including parking, or $199/night including parking, breakfast for your party, a $20 gift gas certificate at Chevron, and a discount coupon for Macy's. Which reminds me, the breakfast was excellent. In addition to the usual fare that you might find on a hotel breakfast buffet, they also had made-to-order omelettes with your choice of ingredients, cheese blintzes, and eggs benedict, among the less-common offerings. Service was also excellent, the orange juice was fresh-squeezed, and the fruit was extra-fresh.The Marriott's location is conveniently near the cable car turnaround, the Cannery, the shops and restaurants of Fisherman's Wharf, and a slightly longer hike to Pier 39. Public transportation from this location is plentiful, so park your car and enjoy the city.The loud smoky next-door neighbors weren't the Marriott's fault. If they hadn't been there, I probably would have loved my stay at Marriott, despite the bed glitch at check-in. Give them a try."
138,2120,"Nov 30 2005 	Comfortable hotel with convenient location	This hotel is small compared with other Marriotts, but is as clean and comfortable as expected. Very close to the Cannery and other Fisherman's Wharf tourist areas. Public transportation is very convenient. Breakfast was average. Would consider staying here again because of location."
139,2120,Nov 28 2005	good hotel	Spent one night in the Marriot and thought it a very nice hotel. Rooms are clean modern and very comfortable. Full marks for one of the most comforable beds Ive ever slept in. Lobby was lovely with fires and comfy seating. We didnt eat at the hotel so cant comment on dining facilities.
140,2120,"Nov 28 2005	A very average hotel	The good: Super Fisherman's Wharf location, easy walk to Alcatraz, boats/piers, Hertz car rental...very quiet room, very friendly and accomodating staff, good service to Marriott Rewards Elite members (free breakfast, upgrade to suite).The bad: Hotel is old and in need of renovation, price seems steep for what you get ($150 for a &quot;regular&quot; room, thank goodness we were upgraded to a suite. $150 felt about right for the suite but the website said the suite was $299 so I would have felt really ripped off at that price.) Also beds were hideously soft. Would I stay here again? Probably not. The location was great but I want more of a new, comfortable hotel."
141,2120,"Nov 1 2005	Liked the Marriot loved San Francisco	Had an overnight stay at the Marriot before returning to the UK. The room was very clean and the bed was so comfortable after a long flight. The massage shower was great for our aching muscles. The hotel staff were polite and no problem leaving all our luggage while we went out for the morning. Our taxi driver Ray who took us to the airport was so fuuny, my son didn't want to get out of the car.If you have only got a short amount of time in San Francisco you must visit Alcatraz and you are perfectly situated at the Marriot for this trip. Loved the Fishermans Wharf area and just wished we had more time. We will go back to San Francisco very soon."
142,2120,"Oct 5 2005	Not Worth It	Paid a premium price, but expected to get our moneys worth, sadly mistaken, bathrooms tiny, If you don't lock the door and are sitting down anyone opening the door will break your knees, having small children this happened frequently. No Pool, would expect one at this price! kudos for health facility, small but impressive, valet parking was a ripoff, registration is in valet area and you must use valet parking or find parking on street and then walk back to hotel to register. found lots of parking for 1/2 what they were charging. noisy, lots of space around door in frame, anyone making noise in the hall woke everyone up.Staff was friendly but slow, slow, slow!Have visited lots of mariotts before (best in norfolk va), and never had a bad experience until now."
143,2120,"Oct 4 2005	A most enjoyable stay	We stayed for 5 nights at the hotel and as requested were given a courtyard room which was quiet and peaceful. The rooms were comfortable, clean, spacious enough and with excellent bed mattresses. We only savoured breakfast once but due to sightseeing during the day and being retired folks we were generally too tired to venture out for dinner in the evening. The food at dinner was of great quality and the chef and our waiter Juan gave superb service. We were treated to a bottle of wine on the last evening and a plate full of fruit fit for a king. Generally speaking all the staff were extremely helpful and practised the meaning of customer service.The hotel is in an ideal location for all the sights and the cable car and we were pleased we had had not booked a hotel downtown which is isolated from the main attractions. One evening after dinner we went to Lou's Blues Bar close to the Wharf and for 5 dollars per head listened to some fantastic blues music. They have live blues music every night and is well worth a visit.The hotel is not a low cost option but is great value and located in the ideal situation of one of the most striking cities in the world. We would not hesitate to return."
144,2120,Sep 14 2005	Wonderful stay	We were so impressed with the hotel. The location was amazing....close to everything! The Barclays Grand Prix went right by the hotel so my husband was beyond thrilled to be so close to the cycling greats. My daughter loved the wharf and shopping. The staff was friendly and we received great recommendations for dinner from the concierge as well as helpful information on getting around. The beds were soooo comfortable. I highly recommend it and will certainly book it again next year.
145,2120,"Sep 14 2005	Mediocre bland hotel	We found the location far from ideal. We considered Fisherman's wharf tacky and touristy, and no way a true reflection of San Francisco. We stayed one of the three nights we had booked as a reward, and were rather suprised when we weren't asked why we were leaving two days early - maybe our actions weren't uncommon!? The hotel was mediocre. It seemed clean enough, but the room we were allocated overlooking the courtyard had the noisiest air conditioning unit I've ever heard - even after a 12 hour flight we couldn't sleep! The complimentary breakfast was a nice touch, but rather crowded. This hotel was not for us and we breathed a sigh of relief when we moved to a hotel in betweeen SoMa and Union Square."
146,2120,"Sep 6 2005	Great hotel	We had an excellent 4 night stay recently at this hotel. All staff were excellent, the rooms were of a substantial size, spotlessly clean and with THE most comfy beds. There are nice Bath and BodyWorks freebies. The buffet breakfast was delicious (about $12) and we also dined one night in the hotel restaurant where the food and service were faultless. The hotel is just a 2-3 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf and in a quiet location. We could not fault anything, and were thoroughly delighted with our stay."
147,2120,"Aug 29 2005	Disappointed - Marriott Platinum Member	Despite being in a great location, this was the sixth hotel on our summer trip to the West Coast, and somewhat of a disappointment comparing to other hotels (Marriott, Best Western and others).Had to change rooms after the first night because of an odor in the hallway, although Hotel Manager receptive to our needs by morning. Hotel layout is not optimal [60's 'design', need I say more] and in need of an uplift, although rooms were clean and quiet. Breakfast area somewhat congested, but omelettes a nice touch.Recommend requesting a room near the elevators, otherwise walking will be on your excercise program. And, ask about full parking rates, including tax on the service (and then, consider parking a few blocks away on some of the residential streets like we did!). Cannot beat the location if first visit to San Francisco, as within short walk to Fishermans Wharf. We were expecting better at the end of our travels to the West Coast."
148,2120,Aug 1 2005	Great Location	Marriott Fishermans Wharf was WONDERFUL!! I know it doesnt look like much from the pictures but the hotel is beautiful. We stayed there for our 13th anniversary and I was more than pleased. The beds are so comfortable and the staff was fabulous. Stay here and you wont be disappointed.
149,2120,"Jul 12 2005	Great hotel	My wife and daughter recently stayed at the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf. We stayed based on recent comments on Trip Advisor. I am happy to report that we were not dissapointed. Everything about the hotel was excellent. The staff could not have been any more pleasant or accomodating. We only stayed one night on our way back from Hawaii and were able to use the hotel as our home base so we could see as much of San Francisco before our red-eye flight home. Although the price for parking was $38 as previously noted by other travelers, it covers a 24 hour period. The location is perfect. The room was immaculate. We arrived late, but were still able to get something to eat in the lounge. The Fisherman's chowder was excellent. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel."
150,2120,"Jul 10 2005	Great location.	Used some of my Marriott &quot;points&quot; to stay here for a couple of nights ove rthe fourth of July. It's a great location near the Wharf. A great buffet breakfast is included in their package, making this a reasonably inexpensive stay. My only complaint is what I thought was an anomallymy last stay seems to be the &quot;norm&quot; and that is the Non-Smoking rooms smell of smoke. I had two rooms this time and one was insufferable. The other was marginal after leaving the window and door open. Last time I stayed here, I had the same problem......very convenient to The Wharf though."
151,2120,"Jul 6 2005	Loved the snuggly soft beds!	My husband and I recently returned from a five-night stay at the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf and loved it! The hotel really is in a great location. It is blocks away from the cable car and F-line and a bus stop is right outside the hotel entrance. We bought a 7-day MUNI pass for $20 each and had unlimited access to each of these modes of transportation. Believe me, that came in handy when we were tired of walking and we could just hop on the nearest ride. The hotel was very nice and we had no problems with the service. We got there about three hours before check in and they allowed us to check in right away. I was afraid we would not get a good room because I have read that when you book with Travelocity, you get the &quot;left-over&quot; rooms. That did not happen at Marriott FW. When I made our reservation, I requested a king, non-smoking room facing the courtyard and that's what we got. Our room was actually a nice size...we didn't feel like it was too small. A few minutes after we got into our room, I heard a loud, squealing noise and realized it was the fountain in the courtyard. As I was thinking that noise will not be good while we are trying to sleep, someone came to fix it. I was impressed. As many people have said, the bed was wonderful! It was so soft and comfortable! My husband is not usually a fan of soft beds, and he even loved the bed. While we were there, I decided I wanted my bed at home to be that way, so I have begun looking at feathertops and down pillows. The only downside to the room is the bathroom is very small. Even with that said, we still loved the room and would definitely recommend this hotel."
152,2120,"Jun 26 2005	The Marriott was great!	After much hand wringing of where to stay in San Francisco with a 16 yr old and a 14 yr old on a family vacation, I finally choose the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf (primarily because I'm a big Marriott Rewards member). I had read varying reviews of this hotel and also had several recommendations from San Francisco regulars to stay near Union Square or in the Financial District . . . not tacky Fisherman's Wharf.Well, I'm glad I didn't listen to them! In my opinion, if you are in SF for a short time with kids, the Fisherman's Wharf area is a perfect place to base your operations. The Marriott hotel was great! Nice lobby. Nice bar. Free internet (with 2 computers and a printer) in the Business Center. Very accommodating staff. Beds were terrific. Typical Marriott furniture and decor. Very close to the Cable Car lines. A full service Safeway grocery store a block away. Lots of restaurants (including fast food -- In and Out, Burger King, McDonalds) close-by. You can walk to Lombard Street, Coit Tower, Fisherman's Wharf (Pier 39) and easily catch the boats to Alcatraz.It's true that parking is expensive, but it is everywhere in this city. Take my recommendation and avoid the hassle. Don't rent a car... you don't need one. You can walk, take a taxi, or buy an all day muni &amp; cable car pass for $9/person and get anywhere you want to go. We did that one day and explored downtown, visited the Cable Car Museum, went to China Town and even searched out the house in Mrs. Doubtfire and Lombard School from the Princess Diaries. It was great fun and our kids loved exploring and riding the cable cars."
153,2120,"Jun 6 2005	Nice room accommodating staff great stay!	My husband and I stayed our last night in San Francisco at this hotel, after spending the previous night on Nob Hill.Check-in was very smooth and we were treated very well. I had made a couple requests months ago when I booked my room, and they were granted without a reminder! I had requested a room on the top floor, facing Jones street (as recommended by other TripAdvisor users!) I was pleased to see they had noted my requests and honored them. The room was a little small, but that didn't really bother us.. We didn't plan a trip to San Francisco to sit in our room! I couldn't wait to try out this bed so many other people have raved about, so I sat down and leaned back, and just sank in!!! It felt so comfortable, I couldn't wait to spend a night there. The view out of our room was decent, we had a pretty good view of a portion of downtown. My biggest complaint about this hotel involves the bathroom. It is definitely showing its age... but the largest problem can easily be fixed! The shower curtain is just plain TACKY. It does not match the class of the hotel by any means, and it would not be hard for Marriott to get some more neutral shower curtains that are more pleasant to look at! The provided toiletries are Bath and Body works- they smell so wonderful and are a nice touch. Parking was once again steep, at $38 a night, but I was prepared for that. It was nice to be so close to the Wharf, where we specifically wanted to be because we were taking a night tour of Alcatraz. When that was finished, it was a quick walk back to the hotel. However, the Marriott is a block or so further inland than many of the other wharf hotels... If you really want to be right on the main strip, the Courtyard or Arognaut will get you a bit closer. The Holiday Inn looked pretty run down, at least from the outside. When we got back to our hotel, we went over to the bar to get some dessert. The menu was rather limited, and nothing looked that great, so we decided to get a pizza to bring back to our room. The bartender was very friendly and accommodating. The bed was VERY comfortable, and we had a great nights' sleep! My husband, however, didn't enjoy the feather bed, but I sure did! It must have been because our room faced Jones Street, but we had absolutely no problem with noise. This is a great hotel, and I had a wonderful experience. I would stay here again, though if I visit San Francisco again, I would prefer to stay in the more immediate downtown area rather than on Fisherman's Wharf. However, it was the perfect location for us to stay after spending an afternoon and evening on the Wharf and at Alcatraz."
154,2120,"Apr 18 2005	Would definitely stay here again	My husband &amp; I just returned from a weekend at the Marriott &amp; what a wonderful time we had. Every review I read mentioned how comfortable the beds were &amp; I thought - how comfortable could they be? They're incredible! The only downfall is - you don't want to get out of them!!! :) The staff was fantastic; anything we asked for they got it for us with a smile. The rooms were clean with nice bath products. I read some reviews that complained of the noise - well here's the deal---you're in the middle of the city - there's noise. Personally, I like it. I like the hustle &amp; bustle of the city - it get me moving and helps me to start my day. Perhaps those people that don't like the horns honking &amp; such should go to the countryside for the weekend instead!!! Anyway, the Marriott helped to make our stay a memorable experience and I highly recommend it everyone."
155,2120,Apr 5 2005	Average hotel	Expensive hotel! Small rooms. Small bathroom. Our non-smoking room smelled like cigarettes. Hotel staff at the front desk enjoyed each others company instead of tending to waiting visitors. Probably won't stay here again.
156,2120,"Mar 21 2005 	'WIT' They mean it	We just completed a 7 night stay at the Mariott, Fisherman's Wharf and couldn't be more pleased. From the enthusiastic &quot;Welcome to San Francisco&quot; by the Bell Man, front desk and Concierge, we were treated to a wonderful week of hotel professionalism and services on and beyond the call of duty. We quickly discovered that the &quot;WIT&quot; buttons worn by the staff meant (Whatever it Takes), and they do mean it. They provided free morning limo service to the financial district, and when the limo was late by ten minutes, the bell man hailed us a cab to take us with no charges. Our initial room was on Columbus Ave, and previously I had read on this advisory to ask for rooms facing the Courtyard or Jones St. We were quickly accomodated and very glad we made the change. The Breakfast Buffet is bountiful, and the Concierge service is superior. The gym is one of the best, with the fresh fruit and added plus. Thank you for all the advisory's that pointed out that taking a rental car in the city is expensive. The hotel parking rate similiar to others was $38 nightly and we were glad to get a 7 day muni pass for $20 each, good for the cable cars and all other transportation except the Bart. We took tours to which tour companies will pick you up directly from your hotel. If you are a family this is a great facility, although we could of stayed at other hotels closer to the financial district, this hotel was a great hub to attend all venues of interest, like Fisherman's Wharf, Beach Blanket Baylon, Alcratraz (take the night cruise) etc etc... Toughest part of journey was leaving the great soft beds and wonderful San Francisco hospitality we received from this Mariott."
157,2120,"Feb 23 2005	Good hotel/facilities	Stayed for one night. Good location. Very comfortable room, good gym facility. Sauna did not have a shower or plunge pool therefore of limited use."
158,2120,Dec 22 2004	Everything you need for a week-long stay in San Fran	We stayed at the Marriott for 7 nights from 1st Dec 04. We arrived on the cable car (our luggage had been delayed so didn't have to carry that with us) and found the hotel easily. The rooms were big and comfortable (especially the bed!) and even though our room faced the street we found it to be quiet. The concierge was extremely helpful and provided good restuarant recommendations. We hired a car and didn't want to pay the $38 + tax to park at the hotel - but we found it extremely easy to find free street parking (even parking right outside the hotel entrance one night - just watch the signs for which nights they are street cleaning). Can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat there. Overall I would say it was a great hotel in a great location - wonderful to come back to after a hard day's sightseeing!
159,2120,"Dec 8 2004	ok Hotel	We stayed at this hotel on the 28th November 04 for 6 nights. On arrival I asked for a Quiet room which the guy at the front desk said would be fine. After checking into the room we were pleased as it was very nice and modern and overlooked the courtyard.However, the room was so noisy because of the minibar and some sort of Air conditioning vent.The hotel was nice, bar excellent, free internet access but we were disappointed with the room we were given as it was so noisy, I would just describe it as average. I would also not stay at Fisherman's Wharf next time as I found Union Square offered more shops and restaurants."
160,2120,Dec 5 2004	Well Done	We stayed at the Marriott for 4 nights as part of a 3 week visit from Australia.This is an excellent hotel providing classy service &amp; facilities at good value.We stayed in eight hotels during our trip and this was our favourite. Staying near Fisherman's Wharf was much better than being in the middle of the city. It was very convenient to the main attractions and the public transport was easy to use.Car parking is very expensive at $43 per night including taxes.Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was a highlight.I hope the SF Hotel workers strike is over now because that was the only (unavoidable) negative. I've still got some of the union songs going through my head!
161,2120,"Dec 1 2004	Great hotel Beds are amazing	This Marriott was very clean and comfortable. The beds were fantastic. We also loved the location. It was a short walk to the wharf, chinatown, north beach, Lombard street etc. We would definitely stay here again."
162,2120,"Nov 9 2004	Great situation for a holiday	Just returned from a week in this excellent hotelFriendly helpful staff,lovely room and very central for seeing San Francisco.Complimentary Internet facility was useful also.We didn't have a car so high tariff for parking did not bother us.Good gym also free to residents was a plus.Ask for a quiet room overlooking the little courtyard/garden and you will sleep like a baby!"
163,2120,"Nov 9 2004	Beds To Die For	Marriott Fisherman's Wharf was more than I expected. Room was completely quiet being on the inside, beds were the most inviting I have experienced worldwide. Staff was pleasant and accomodating. Room was available for early occupation -10:00 AM.Breakfast in restaurant very good. Drinks and lite fare in bar excellent. Location terrific. MUNY stops outside of door ."
164,2120,"Sep 28 2004	Great Hotel	This hotel was very nice, and the beds were outstanding. If you stay here, request a room on the Jones St. side, rather than Columbus. We were here for three nights and didn't hear any traffic noise at all. As far as parking, DO NOT rent a car!! Use the public transportation, since parking is very expensive in SF. I would definately stay here again.."

176,2120,May 25 2007 	Muy buena eleccin
1,2121,Nov 10 2009 	Fine for what we needed.	We booked online no problems. Price was good for what we wanted - i e just for somewhere to crash for the night after being out sight - seeing all day. Yes it was on a 24 hour bus route which was great - we knew we could always get home at night as the bus stop was basically at the front door. Bus ticket price was $2. to get into town and the trip took about 45 mins. Yes it was in the ethnic part of town but we found that interesting. Our room was clean. Breakfast was good. We were able to leave our luggage locked up on the last day while we were touring before we flew out. Front desk personel (Clay ) was lovely even booked our airport shuttle bus .
2,2121,"Nov 6 2009 	Disgusting place to stay	The Mission District has the most crime in San Francisco and being in this hotel you know why. First, it is run by an Asian family with kids all over the lobby and parking lot. They lock everything at 10pm because of the crime and because they have kids. If you are there and need anything after 10pm forget it. The room are old and stink with the masking smell of pine. The rooms are old and run-down. The beds are old and hard. The lower level rooms all have a bathroom window with no screen or bars on it. If you open the window, you could crawl in or out. Plus the window is not secure. This is a huge safety concern...! There is an industrial area next to the hotel so you hear banging all day. At night, dogs bark and people argue and fight. It is the worst hotel I have stayed at in San Francisco and I frequent the Bay often. Heed the warning and upgrade to a downtown location central to everything. This way you feel secure and safe and can enjoy the city. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
3,2121,"Oct 5 2009 	Most shocking experience ever	This Motel cannot be recommended to anyone! Seriously! If you enjoy drunk junkies/gang members pounding on your door at 3am telling to let you into your room than you are at the right lace. Okay this service isn't for free, and after such an experience you pay for 2 nights even if you only slept there for one. Apart from that there were blood stains on the bed, a tough woman at the front desk which is stabbern and arrogant. In addition the phone didn't work even when dialing 911. Again this cannot be recommended."
4,2121,"Sep 26 2009 	You get what you pay for...	Everything is average for a motel. The motel room was clean. The bed wasn't the most comfortable I've ever been in but it wasn't the most uncomfortable. Plenty of places deliver there. And the Muni bus line passes right in front so you can get to SamTrans, other Muni lines, or Bart from their. It probably helped that we know our way around the city. And the service is passable, they didn't spit on us or anything. You can hear the Muni bus pass by all through the night though (and it really runs ALL through the night) so I would suggest some ear plugs. I would recommend this place if your not looking for any of the frills.And as for the Romance, you have to bring that with you."
5,2121,Aug 1 2009 	Good motel.	The hotel/motel was very good. Customer service was good. The people who managed the motel were very friendly. The rooms were clean. I am satisfied with my stay at the hotel. The prices were cheap.
6,2121,"May 18 2008 	The Worst Hotel Ever!	This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at! The front desk peple were very rude! The 1st night someone was trying to check in late at night while we were sleeping, &amp; no one was at the front desk so that person just kept honking their horn! There were bugs in the room, the bathroom was disgusting, the pillows were harder than a rock, it looked like it was 2 pillows sewed together! I had to go to a store and buy a new pillow just so I could sleep! The next night we were awaken at 2:00 A.M. by screaming, profanity, cars screaching in parking lot, people running and stomping above us. It was alot of people partying extremely loud until 4:30 in the morning. We tried to call the front desk but noone answered, so we called the cops. The cops didnt even show up to do anything.We payed $75/night, later we heard the Hilton by the airport was charging the same rate! So we will definately stay there next time.I wouldnt recommend this hotel to my worst enemy!"
7,2121,"Nov 13 2007 	Avoid this motel at all cost	We booked a two bedroom apartment for four people for just one night. We arrived to find it was a motel rather than a hotel, with some very unfriendly guy at the reception. We wanted to have a look at the rooms first, but he declined, pay and get to look at the rooms or leave. Then, he found out that we have a dog with us. No dogs, he tells us, only to leave to the back, return and tell us that the dog would be OK for $50 extra. We gracefully declined, and two of us went on to use the apartment, we were to leave with the dog to find some other property. The receptionist actually followed us to the parking lot to check if we really did leave with the dog !! The two people staying at the &quot;Motel&quot; then told us that rather than a two bedroom apartment, they found some cheap room with two double beds in it. For the same price we paid at the Mission Inn, we spent the night at the Hilton SF financial district with great bay views rather than the Mission Inn in a run-down neighbourhood."
8,2121,"Oct 16 2007	Scary Motel	We were in town for a long weekend and thought we would save some money and stay at the Mission Inn. Oh My God!!! We stayed one night there- I slept in my clothes, the bed was so gross. There was hair onthe walls of the shower BEFORE any of us got in. This motel is in a HORRIBLE location. We checked out after the first night (they did give me my deposit back, but I honestly didnt care at that point) andwent to another hotel. Ended up paying $400.00 per night at our new hotel at Fisherman's Warf - but we didnt care about the money, thats how bad this place was. There were these young thugs having a party in a room close to us....there was some scary stuff going on over there. This is NOT in a safearea at all.Cause we wanted to try and &quot;save&quot; some money - we ended up paying about $1,200.00 on hotels for a 3 night since we had to pay for the Mission up front, but at that point it didnt matter. Pay the extra money and stay someplace safe."
9,2121,Oct 1 2007	Worst Hotel Ever	I am all for cheap hotels but the Mission Inn was very dissappointing. I was late for check-in and because of that I was forced to sleep in my car and I was charged for that night. Nobody was at the front office until the next which they arrived late. On top of that they have bad customer service and feel it's a priveledge for you to stay at their hotel. I would highly advise against booking this hotel.
10,2121,"Jun 30 2007 	The worst place to spend a weekend - dont go there	The pictures here is not about nearly neighbourhood. All that hood smells like sever, be sure there is many dangerous individuals - gang members - i m not kiddin, taxi driver tell us after our horror weekend few necessary rules about life there. We heard that most provoking colours are red and blue, cause main streetgangs wear just this kind of clothes.In the kitchen were ants... The hispanic woman-manager(maybe Jessie...) is really LIAR. She charged me $100 cause i smoked in balcony in front of rooom - not in room. First evening told me that i cant smoke just inside. It was no chance to discussion with her. And bonus - last night(about midnight) was running around our door crazy junkie guy screamin something about he was biting by snake - nothing nice... We, 4 slovak guys comming there from South Dakota were spending there just 3 nights but never more in Mission Inn.Better under Golden Gate =)))Tommy"
11,2121,"Jun 16 2007	Liars and Cheats	On May 25th we booked our reservations at this Mission Inn for two nites May 26th and May 27th. We drove all the way from Bakersfield California and finally reached the motel. We walked into the front office and there were two people behind the desk, a man and a lady named Josie. We tried to check in but Josie said that they never received our reservations and there were no vacancies anyway. We showed her our confirmation for the room via email but she profusely shook her head and looked away. She said she could not help us.We finally was able to obtain another room in San Francisco and finish our vacation (we're from Hawaii). Once we got home we found out they charged us for the room which we have never received. We called and demanded a reimbursement and they hung up on us!Recommendation: If you are planning a vacation don't travel to San Francisco!!!!!!!"
12,2121,"Jun 15 2007 	Best Place in San Fransisco	This Inn has to be the best place in San Fransisco, the entire area and room was spotlessly clean, friendly staff to welcome you to San Fran,Ample parking and the complementary breakfast was excellent. Many thanks for a great stay at your Inn.Noel &amp; Lillian ... Ireland."
13,2121,"Jun 12 2007 	STILL HORRIFIED from this ROACH infested NIGHTMARE of a motel	We booked on HOTELS.com just to find out when we get there that the motel had canceled relations with HOTELS.com and did not have our reservation. In line ahead of us was an irate guest demanding her money back and we know why now. We ended up taking THAT room thinking we would just grin and bare it. We would get some much needed rest, a shower, and save a little money to go back to the city and see some sights. But it was AWEFUL...it smelled like an old dirty ashtray....when you turn on the heat roaches come out EVERYWHERE...there is mold on the walls....stains on ALL linens...smells and pubic hairs galore....sunken in beds....remote control did not work....burnt out light bulb....asked for a new one and manager said they would bring one up and never did....SO i could go on and on but that should be enough to hopefully sway you to spend a few dollars more and stay in ANY other place but the HORRIFIC Mission INN...ACK I WANNA VOMIT just thinking about our experience !!!! Brian and Adina from Sacramento"
14,2121,"Jun 4 2007 	You get what you pay for.	We booked a reservation online and from the photos (advertisement), it looked great!. However, upon arrival, we had to wait outside the glass window to check in. Nobody was attending the front window so we stood outside waiting for someone to assist us for approx 5-10 minutes. Keep in mind that around the corner is not a safe area (kinda ghetto).Once we checked in the room, it was NOT what we expected. This hotel might be haunted. The entire night I kept waking up, thinking someone was in the room with me. I tried to search online for the history of this hotel but couldnt find any information. I thought I was just imagining things so I just went to sleep.I woke up in the middle of the night right after what appeared to be an out of body experience. Upon waking up, the room was cold.I couldnt sleep the rest of the night. I watched TV and walked around the room and noticed what appeared to be blood on the box spring of my bed."
15,2121,"Apr 24 2007 	BED BUGS 	The fact is that they might change the towels (MAYBE)--but that's about it! This place was so gross, I had to get my money back. We came in on 4/20/07 and got a room with a faucet that leaked all over the bathroom. I turned it on in the first place because I notice a long piece of hair (not mine) in the faucet, so I ran the water to clean around the area. Only to discover my sox were drenched. I tried to let that slide but when I was going to take a shower, I noticed that there was hair inside the shower too, pubic and scalp (I am sure of it). I Called Clay the owner/manager but he did not pick up so I walked down to the front office, he was difficult and was asking me to pay money to be switched rooms!!! Though he knew of this leak but had acted at fist as he didn't. I told him I would not pay more money and that I wanted a refund to which he agreed to switch me rooms so I gave it a second chance. The second room was just as dirty. Housekeeping did not even bother to discard of the shampoo bottle and soap that were inside the shower. If you care about your health--don't stay here. This place is really gross, that's not an exaggeration. Dish out a few more bucks and take care of yourself instead of trying to save a penny and end up with infections and the like."
16,2121,"Jan 31 2007	Don't stay here!!!	Horrible, discusting, rude, and dangerous. This place is in a very bad area. I had booked online as it was the closest place to where my daughter was going to school in S.F. The manager would not refund any of our money. We paid and left and went to stay at a safe and decent place."
17,2121,"Apr 20 2006	Beware online reservations	The manager was very helpful, but I made the reservations for a large party for 3 rooms online and they did not have the 3rd room reserved. The Mission Inn did not have available the room with the kitchenette that was advertised and reserved online. If you make online reservations, be sure to call the managers prior to arrival to be sure they have your reservation and the correct size room reserved. I did not find the area to be a bad side of town in SF. It is almost in Daly City but has much traffic."
18,2121,Oct 10 2005	Horrid in every aspect possible	This hotel would possibly be the worst I have ever stayed in. The manager was rude and very surly even to the point of swearing at me. They will not open the door but make you stay outside to conduct business even though the sign says open from 7am to 11pm. The shower is disgusting when you have a shower the bath does not drain and you end up ihaving your shower in a bath full of water. The maid that cleaned my room left a bag of rubbish in my overnight bag. Don't book over the internet as this means nothing to this rude individual. The area itself is not what I would call safe with gang types hanging around the street corners.
19,2121,"Jul 30 2004	Do Not Stay Here!	1) This Hotel is a Dump2) Its in a TERRIBLE Ghetto-y neighborhood. I observed gang members and prostitutes.3) The manager, Jossie, is a rude scheming liar, pretends not to speak English, and will go out of her way to attempt to rip you off.Heres my story:On July 27 I called the Mission Inn to confirm that someone would be able to check my aunt and I in around 2AM as we would be driving up from LA. I was advised, by Jossie, that there would. I stated I would book the room on the net and would be arriving early on January 31st. We were visiting my sister who was in the final weeks of her pregnancy and not doing well, which added some urgency to the visit.After driving over 8 hours, and being awake nearly 24, my aunt and I arrived at the hotel. There was a HUGE neon OPEN sign in the window of the lobby; however, the lobby was locked and no one responded to our repeated plying of the night-bell, knocks on the door, and windows.After 20 minutes of these shenanigans standing in the cold &amp; fog, exhausted, being eyeballed by four, bald-headed, baggy-pantsed gang member-looking types, we decided to find other accommodations. We left a note in the night desk window stating we had arrived to check in to no avail, and would be back in the morning for a full refund as my credit card had ALREADY been charged. They charged me for a room I did not, nay, could not, stay in.Long story short, it took me over three months, and many phone calls, to get my $225- back from the Mission Inn. I had to contact their parent company, Pegasus, in Dallas, Texas, and eventually had to threaten legal action to get a refund, which I did not receive until April, 2004. Each stated the other had my funds. In short, a nightmare, and I will never book another Hotel online. I booked this at cheaphotels. I dont recommend them, either.RUN, do not pass Go, do not stay at this hotel!"
20,2121,"Apr 15 2004	Awful. Terrible service	Our visit to the Mission Inn was horrible, to say the least. The resident manager, Jossie, is a conniving liar who forced our party to wait outside for over an hour and refused to check us in, even though she had stated she would accept a faxed credit card authorization from the person who made the reservation. In fact, Jossie required us to make a cash deposit and agree to an extra person charge of $5 per person despite the fact that: (1) we had never been told about this prior to arrival or notified in any way and (2) the charge applied to two toddlers, ages 2 and 4. The rooms stank and the floors were just plain dirty (it blackened the bottom of my son's socks!). I would never go back to this motel and would definitely NOT recommend it to anyone, unless I hated them.To make matters worse, when we wanted to stay an extra day, Jossie stated that it would be higher rate because it was a Sunday night! But when you try to book a room through other avenues, the rate is the same for EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. We had to pay because we had no where else to go and feel that Jossie took full advantage of us."
1,2128,Aug 5 2009 	Review of Oceanview Motel Area	Last Sept. I was visiting my son who lives across the street from the Caltrain station by the Giants stadium. I wanted to see the ocean. I got on the N Line and rode it to the end. There I ate a snack at a coffee shop and walked over the dune to the ocean. I sat down and immediately saw whales spouting in the distance. I asked a surfer about them and he confirmed that was what they were but had never seen them there before. I noticed a small motel which I thought was &quot;Oceanside&quot;. I loved the neighborhood and proximity to so many things to see and do but could never locate it again until I saw it here tonight. I hope my husband and I can stay there this Sept. It sounds like what we are looking for. Thank you to all reviewers
2,2128,"May 7 2009 	Great place for the price	This was our third stay at the Oceanview Motel. We like the location, given proximity to the beach and transportation. Java Beach Coffee next door is a great place for any meal, including a light dinner.The rooms are pretty basic, but rather large. There is a fridge and a microwave, great when staying in SF since you may not always want to buy dinner. We ordered in the first night and kept the leftovers for another meal.It's not fancy and there are no doormen, elevators or concierge, but it's a motel folks. You can get a good clean room, no bed bugs, in a safe neighborhood for less than $100 a night. The N Judah line ends right out front, so you can get to anywhere in the city without much trouble. Parking is free, worth another $50 a night in some places.If you need a basic place to stay with your destination, not your room, being the treat, this is the place to stay."
3,2128,"Mar 22 2009	Don't stay unless your desperate	This place was terrible. The entrance smelled of old wet carpet. The hallways smelled of curry. The doors rattled and when I spoke to the person at the front desk about it she said there wasn't anything that could be done,so I took a few guides from the lobby and stuck them around the door jam to stop it. There was no elevator. The towels were old,gray and like sand paper. The only good thing was that there was a great chinese rest. a block away on Judah."
4,2128,"Dec 31 2008 	Good Basic Motel	The Oceanview Motel is a good basic motel in a very convenient location for the west side of SF at the corner of Judah and the Great Highway (Hwy 1). It was relatively inexpensive and though it is a bit old and worn, effort is obviously made to keep the rooms clean and neat. We had room 132 on the top floor facing the rear (parking area) which is a good choice in that it faces away from the convenient but noisy N-Judah Line streetcar which turns around right outside the front door of the motel with a fare amount of squealing noise right through the night (bring ear plugs). This room is also at the end of the indoor hall and shares only one wall with another room so it is quiet in that way, as well. The N-Judah takes you straight to 9th and Irving, 2 blocks south of Golden Gate Park and the Cal. Academy of Science and DeYoung museums. If you stay on it, it will also take you all the way across town. Next door to the motel is the great Java Beach Cafe, a neighborhood coffee shop that serves oatmeal and pastries for breakfast as well as sandwiches and salads all day, as well as many coffee and tea drinks. The ocean is right across the Great Highway, steps away. The wonderful Beach (and Park) Chalet Brewpub is .7 miles and walking distance north along the Great Highway from the motel. It was nice to park the car at the motel and just take the bus/streetcar around to see the sights. Bus line 18 goes along the Great Highway if you want to go up to the Cliff House, Legion of Honor, or the great Land's End hiking trail with its fabulous views of the ocean and Golden Gate Bridge. For it's great location, public transportation access, and relatively low price for the city, we were very happy with our two night stay at the Oceanview Motel."
5,2128,Oct 25 2008 	Don't Stay Here!!!!	This place is not clean!!! There floors are filthy! The windows are black. There are droppings on the floor!! Holes in the linnens and towels. Manager did not care and we were charged for a night. After immediately checking back out. This place needs to be condemed. WARNING!!!
6,2128,"Oct 4 2008 	A very nice experience!	The Oceanview Hotel is a great place to stay if you would like to see San Francisco like a local. It is situated in a neighborhood. Right next door is the Java Beach Cafe, a local coffee bar. Hang out with the locals or go across the street and walk the beach.We live a few miles away in Sausalito but wanted to stay in the city for convenience. Our plans were to go to the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass concert in Golden Gate Park.We arrived midday on Friday. Parking is on a first come basis and we easily got a spot. Our room was on the second floor facing Judah Street. The room was very basic, but clean and neat. It had what we needed. It is definitely not luxury, but the price is unbelievable for San Francisco and the location. It is in a wonderful location: a block from the ocean and on a major transit line. The Judah Line will take you where you need to go or connect. It is a few blocks from Golden Gate Park.If you are sensitive to sounds, ask for a room away from Judah. Honestly, the street noise did not keep us awake or was any way obtrusive. We'd definitely would stay there again and recommend it to friends.I gave it 3 stars so as not to exceed expectations. But, if you go into it with the right attitude, it is 4 stars because of its cleanliness and friendly front desk staff."
7,2128,"Jun 5 2008 	Close to Beach	My friend and I enjoyed our stay there. Our room was facing the main street, but there were no major noise issues. Amenities are very basic as you'd expect in any motel. We needed an iron, but they didn't have one that we could borrow. A coffee shop is conveniently located next to the motel seemed to be a popular neighborhood hang out. We enjoyed our breakfast there. We chose this motel for free parking. Also we wanted to stay somewhere different than Union Sq for a change."
8,2128,"Jan 1 2008 	Not too bad...	My husband and I just wanted a simple, clean inexpensive place to stay in the Ocean Beach area of San Francisco for one night, and we decided to give this place a try.It wasn't bad, in fact, in some ways it felt like some of the inexpensive places we have stayed in Europe (although they are usually much smaller). It certainly was inexpensive -- only $80 during the Christmas/New Year week, including free parking. The location is across the highway from a huge beach and within walking distance of Golden Gate Park, and landmark (albeit touristy) restaurants like the Beach Chalet and the Cliff House.I wasn't sure about it at first. The &quot;lobby&quot; was small and a bit dingy, and the clerk was behind glass. When we entered the stairway to get to our room, it looked like it hadn't been vacuumed or tended to in quite a while. When we got to our room, we had forgotten to ask for non-smoking and the room absolutely reeked of cigarettes! I immediately called the front desk and asked that we be moved to a non-smoking room. The room we were then given was much nicer. It was considerably larger ( it had one queen bed, but was large enough for two) and had a better view (over the rooftops next door, we could see the ocean). The bathroom facilities were fairly new and there was a skylight above the shower/tub. The room had a small refrigerator, microwave oven, &amp; coffee maker. The negatives were: very small bath towels, a somewhat uncomfortable bed (harder than I like), really flat pillows (and no extras), and the heater was very noisy, so we didn't sleep very well.All in all, it was certainly adequate for our needs on this particular visit to the city. And luckily for us, the weather was really beautiful, so we spent most of our time outside of the room anyway!"
9,2128,"May 15 2007	Good value for SF	A bare bones but comfortable, clean motel for a reasonable price (by San Francisco standards). The neighborhood has several excellent restaurants, and is outside the usual touristy parts of Frisco. It's not hard to find a laundromat, gas station, convenience store, video store, or public transit. A comfortable coffee shop next door has free Wifi though the motel itself does not.It's about 45 minutes away from downtown by trolley, but if you're a nature lover who'd rather see Ocean Beach, Golden Gate Park, and Land's End instead of Fisherman's Wharf or Japantown, you can't find a better location.As long as you just want a comfortable place to stay and aren't looking for bellhops, room service, and other four star amenities, and don't mind being on the far western part of town, you should be happy here."
10,2128,"Apr 10 2007 	Transit friendly	San Francisco is a great place to visit. It is even more fun if you don't have to worry about driving all over town, and looking for a place to park, then paying the price. Here is an idea. Stay at the Oceanview Motel on Judah St. It is at the end of the N-Judah streetcar line, and across from Ocean Beach. We paid $69 per night, and used the SF MUNI transit system to get to all the places we wanted to go in San Francisco.The room was clean and comfortable, and a good bargain. The staff was wonderful. I would like to keep this a secret, so I can get a room when I return, but I will tell on them. If I were to grade them, it would be an A-.  It is a short walk across the street to the ocean, and there is a little coffee hut next door. You can walk to Golden Gate Park, the Cliff House or the Zoo. Sure, you can spend $175 or more on a room, but why bother? The object of the trip is to see the local attractions. Most of the time when I am in my room, the only thing I see is the inside of eyelids! So, in a nutshell, Yes i would gladly stay there again, and I would recommend it to my best friends."
11,2128,Sep 26 2006	this was ok	stayed here for 2 nights - friendliest staff so far in our 3 week adventure! We knew we would only be sleeping in our room as too much to see and do in SF. Hotel clean and spacious and lady on reception so helpful - gave us maps and routes and everything she could to help us explore. Muni terminal outside so catching the muni in and out of city easy - hotel give you info on routes you need so not a problem - and all for $1.50 for as far as you can travel for 2 hours. Numerous bars and restaurants close by - we had an Indian meal in a small restaurant 2 mins walk away and it was ok - beach over the road too.
12,2128,"Jul 31 2006 	Not Bad For The Money	I recently stayed at the Oceanview and while it isn't the greatest motels in The City, for the cost, it is pretty decent. The couple who run the motel, are I believe Indian and are very nice. I did notice that the windows don't lock, and in fact our window could have fallen out of the track and crashed on the floor if I wasn't the careful sort, but overall the hotel is clean, easy to get to and very close to the beach which is really nice. It is also pretty quiet and even has a little minifridge. For someone who wants to spend no more than $75.00 a nice, this is definitely THE PLACE!!"
13,2128,"Jan 22 2006	Great	This hotel was fine. It is cheap - Sure it is not a 4 star hotel but the price is right. You can stay in the busy city for an estimated $280-$350 a night for a nice room or you can stay here for $55-$65 a night and get your basic room. All you really are doing is sleeping there anyway. If you new to California you spend most of your time outdoors- so it works out great. The Muni Stops right in front of the hotel and you can take it to the Bart and then grab a bus to Fishermans Wharf. It is so awesome. I have been coming here once a year for a week at a time for 3yrs now. It is only around $380 for the whole week stay. For a 2 night getaway I would also reccommend the peaceful, relaxing Pacifica not that far. Although you will need a cab to get there. Hope this helps out a little!Here is thier site;"
14,2128,"Nov 21 2005	Cheap but not so great	I stayed here for one night while in the City for my daughter's graduation. It was convenient since she lives on the N Judah streetcar line that ends in front of the hotel. Also nice if you want to walk on the beach, which is wonderful at sunset. What isn't so nice is that it is near a public toilet facility that attracts less than desirable folk. The room was dark and dingy, barely okay for a place to sleep. Only one key. Windows dirty. It seems like a lot of the rooms are rented long term, although I am not sure. I would not recommend it and will not stay there again. I believe that there are better choices - just need to keep looking!"
15,2128,"Jun 20 2004	windows dont lock	We arrived at the Oceanview hotel one day of august 2003, had to pay 90 on the spot and were given a large room on the second floor. First thing we saw: the windows couldnt lock, and the emergency stairs platform was right there. On our complaint we were given another room: same problem (due to saline corrosion it seems). In a rude way, the manager said we could get our money back and leave. We stayed a night and moved the next day across the street to the BEACH HOTEL, same price, frendlier and safer. Be aware of the quite long bus ride to get there from center if you do not have a car."
16,2128,"Apr 21 2004	Bare Bones but GREAT for Beach Lovers	I have been staying at the OceanView for many years. I am used to staying in 5 star hotels and find it refreshing to stay in a place where every convenience is NOT provided and is a stone's throw from the beach and the Golden Gate Park. The Java Cafe is fabulous and is right next door. I find that management is very accommodating when guests are respectful and appreciative. No, it's not the greatest but it is a wonderful getaway at the beach and I'm not running into people I know and want to suck the life out of my day."
17,2128,"Feb 7 2004	So cheesy be renamed The Cheese Town Motel	I had to stay @ this motel for a couple of weeks. I was terrible. The shower leaked, there was little to no made service. The cost to use the phone was astronomical and to top it off, the wall were so thin you could here everything and everyone. In a pinch this will do. It is near the beach and the excellent Java Cafe. On whole, this place will never be confused with the taj mahal."
18,2128,"Jun 16 2003	Bare bones ops.	Yes, clean and economical but comfortable? Spare key nonexistent, walls might as well have been made of paper, the MUNI turnaround out front adds to the noise comfort, shower required unstopping, no second curtain, and local calls are 0.50/&quot; vice /call. Pluses if you consider them are a remote, beach proximity, adjacent internet cafe, and complimentary customer parking when available. You'd have to open a new classification for here since it ranks somewhere between a 1, terrible and 2, OK but problems. Would recommend for beachmongers."

We stayed here 2 nights on our way home from a long road trip...it was highly ranked on Tripadvisor and was priced reasonably for a suite (with 3 queen beds) in the city (very important to give those car-bound siblings - and their parents - some personal space). I would recommend requesting a room back off the street as the trolley runs regularly right next to the motel
8,2129,Jul 10 2009 	Lovely Personal Motel	We stayed at the Ocean Park Motel because
9,2129,Jun 26 2009 	Great value	Ocean park motel lays a bit from SF but the munirail goes direct to centrum. Compare too other hotels in SF its great value for the money. We travelled with 3 children and room was big and plenty of space. Its overall a great pleasuere too stay here
10,2129,Jun 3 2009 	Loved this motel!	Our son was graduating from SFSU and we chose the Ocean Park as it is about 3 miles to his place and less than that to campus. Lovely grounds and cozy rooms made this a great choice for our SF visit. The muni to downtown goes right by
11,2129,May 22 2009 	Good Choice	Previous review are abs right.A pleasant hotel
12,2129,May 15 2009 	An attractive well-run motel in a suburban location with good light rail access to the city.	The Ocean Park has plenty of charm. We stayed for two nights initially and then another night after our trip to Yosemite. The suburban location near San Francisco Zoo (and the beach) was a good alternative to staying in the CBD. There is good light rail access to the city via the MUNI-L line ($1.50 pp
13,2129,May 10 2009 	Charm service and a slice of nostalgia in one brief stay	We flew in to San Francisco and needed a place to overnight before starting a road trip. The choice was functional airport hotel - plastic and synthetic
14,2129,Mar 24 2009 	It's now our favorite place to stay.	This is a charming
15,2129,Mar 11 2009 	This place is a gem  right next to the Beach	The owners could not be more accommodating and the service is so friendly. I needed wireless connection and I was not disapointed . The rooms are very clean and the beds are fantastic. I felt so comfortable and secure in this place away from home. It is a real &quot;find&quot; with easy access to SF. In the morning you can stroll over to the coffee shop around the corner and enjoy breakfast.	
16,2129,Feb 1 2009 	Loved the ambience! Wonderful Management!	Loved the old fashioned feel here- certainly not one of those modern hotels- Where else do you still get a &quot;real&quot; door key??The manager/owner was very helpful and nice- waited up for me to show up late- extremely helpful- very cozy and safe feeling. We live only an hour a way
17,2129,Oct 26 2008	Fair price and Clean	The title sums it up for me
18,2129,Oct 18 2008 	Why would you EVER want to stay downtown again!?!?!	I found this place on Tripadvisor after despairing of the current high cost of downtown accommodations. The Ocean Park is the perfect antidote: affordable
19,2129,Oct 4 2008 	I'm in Love with the Ocean Park Motel	I have been traveling the world for over 30 years. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels and motels
20,2129,Sep 25 2008 	Very clean and friendly place to stay. Not to mention really affordable $	Very nice and clean place to stay. Especially for families with kids or people that appreciate a quiet and friendly environment. Initially had a hard time locating the place and would appreciate an option to book online. Im glad we found this site as it was both reasonable and enjoyable. Would stay there again and recommend with comfort.	
21,2129,Sep 18 2008 	Super Place	My wife and I stayed in the Ocean Park Motel for 8 nights in early September 2008. Our plan was to stay in one place
22,2129,Aug 26 2008 	Clean and comfortable with character!	I just dropped my daughter off to begin college at SFSU! We're from San Diego
23,2129,Aug 11 2008 	Ok but not great	We have just returned from staying at the ocean park after reading all the great reviews on this site and I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. Given that it's currently ranked 25th in San Francisco I was expecting good value with a semi-decent location.We were staying for 4 nights and if I've known how long it took to get into the downtown area would have definitely booked something a bit closer. To be in the thick of it (Powell / Market) you're looking at around 40 minutes on the MUNI which gets a bit much day after day - you're supposed to be on holiday after all! If you're driving discount this point as the motel offers easy access to the 280 interstate or 101 if you're going up north. The MUNI that passes the front of the motel is pretty noisy so we had requested a back room which was better
24,2129,Jul 21 2008 	Loved it! Excellent location!	There were four of us in a two bedroom suite. We had two teens (ages 17)
25,2129,Jul 14 2008	Enjoyed the Ocean Park Motel	My daughter
26,2129,Jun 11 2008	Motel price is too expensive	We have stayed at the Ocean Park Motel at least 10 times over the past 15 years. When we first visited
27,2129,Jun 6 2008 	Like being at home	We spent three nigths in ocean park motel
28,2129,Jun 3 2008 	great 	Loved this place. Absolutely charming art-deco hotel. Owners very friendly and helpful. Rooms were quaint and old-fashioned but extremely clean. Loved the way the renovations were in keeping with the art deco spirit. Beautiful grounds. A block from the beach
29,2129,May 14 2008 	Pride in Ownership	My husband and I took a two week trip to San Francisco and surrounding areas. We decided to make a reservation here for our first night in town because of the reviews and price. It was kind of a strange experience. When you check in
30,2129,Apr 6 2008 	Perfect Place	We spent 2 weeks in the San Francisco area in March which included 5 nights at the Ocean Park Motel. We are English and had this notion of a typical American family-run motel and I'm pleased to say that it was exactly what we'd hoped for. The motel itself is located in a quiet part of SF but the tram stop is located right across the street so getting to and from the city centre is very easy. The ocean itself is a 5-minute walk and the zoo is a couple of minutes away. We just loved the tranquil atmosphere and the way the rooms looked out onto a beautiful quiet courtyard (see photos!). SF is a typical busy city with lots to see and do
31,2129,Apr 3 2008 	second time around very good.	This was our second stay at the Ocean Park. Once again it met our needs perfectly. Street car to get us downtown to see the sights and easy off street parking that allowed us to use our car to get out of town and back easy. It is a very good location for day trips to the north and south. Stayed 5 days with 2 rooms excellent service from all members of the staff. Local places to eat
32,2129,Apr 2 2008	Charming bit of San Fransico history.	Staying at the Ocean Park was coming back to my California roots. The space was charming and comfy. I love seeing this old gem restored and functional.I felt very comfortable
33,2129,Feb 22 2008 	OK Hotel Nice Location	We stayed at the Ocean Park while visiting our daughter at SFSU. The manager was nice and the hotel is located in a residential area. The rooms are dated but quaint. I guess that's part of the classic art deco feel of the hotel. The Ocean Park is very close to the SF Zoo and Beach. For a good place to eat try the Bashful Bull Restaurant a few blocks walk into the neighborhood (Great Breakfast All Day!). Now for the caveat
34,2129,Feb 16 2008	Retro Motor Motel	This is a cute little motor court motel that is everything motels aren't anymore. The art deco exterior is great and the updated interior are awesome. This is old school and you must have no 'motel' expectations when you check in. This is a charming
35,2129,Jan 27 2008 	Nice Place!	This was a great place and a very good choice. It is two blocks from the beach
36,2129,Jan 17 2008 	Loved Ocean Park Motel	I have stayed in various hotels in San Francisco (all price ranges) and found that Ocean Park Motel was the very best value and we enjoyed the friendly service
37,2129,Nov 25 2007 	Neighborhood Charm	If you want to stay at a place that is rich in local history where the owners live on the property and the neighbors commute on the streetcar that runs by your door then this is the place for you. A list of favorite neighborhood restaurants and ear plugs are thoughtfully given to you upon check-in along with a map of the city with transit options. Hop a bus to the DeYoung museum then dine on some of the finest crab in SF - all without driving a car on those nerve wracking hills! Helpful local staff provide opportunities for experiences off the beaten tourist path. The rooms are simple and clean. The price/value/experience ratio is great. I stay here whenever I am in SF for an art fair.	
38,2129,Nov 13 2007 	Quirky and Charming	I like to stay in quirky little places like this. Being the first motel in San Francisco
39,2129,Oct 26 2007 	Wonderful Fun - Especially for Families	My two small children and I stayed at the Ocean Park Motel in August of this year. What a fun experience! We had a two room unit with a kitchen - and while it was small
40,2129,Sep 30 2007 	A charming place! Exceeds expectations	Our room on the courtyard was very small but completely sufficient for two nights. Quirky but safe neighborhood filled with endless varieties of rowhouses; great restaurants along Taraval! Our proprietors have really kept the restored motel in great shape
41,2129,Sep 25 2007	What a dump!!	We use tripadvisor all the time
42,2129,Sep 24 2007 	Great Experience	We had a wonderful stay at the Ocean Park as we kicked off our trip down PCH 1 to Los Angeles. Very friendly and helpful proprietor who has an obvious love for this property. This makes all the difference. In the right hands this is a charmer of a motel. Spotless
43,2129,Sep 9 2007 	loved the ocean park motel	We just stayed one night at the ocean park before flying back but we really liked it. The guy at the reception was super friendly and provided us with lots of useful information ( map
44,2129,Aug 31 2007 	Out of the ordinary	We spent part of our visit to SF in the main part of the city
45,2129,Jul 9 2007	Great Stay!	The Ocean Park is a great place to stay. I stayed a week in room #5. I was by myself. I felt safe and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. Parking off street is provided but the spaces may be small. I loved being two blocks from the ocean and less from public transport. The hotel has free wifi
46,2129,May 22 2007 	Great Art Deco Experience	This hotel was a delight to stay at! I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor and decided my boyfriend and I would stay for 2 nights. The owners and staff were very friendly and always willing to help out with questions and accomodations. The hot tub was amazing - definitely a treat after a long day! The one thing to know is that this hotel is not in central SF -- it is on the coast and a bit of a ways out. I think it would have been a little more difficult to stay here without a car. But if you have one
47,2129,Sep 25 2006 	A real treat!	I stayed at the Ocean Park recently while I was attending an Irish language immersion weekend at the nearby United Irish Cultural Center. I was originally drawn to the motel primarily by the fact that it is right on the L-Taraval street car line
48,2129,Sep 11 2006 	A Hidden Gem	I put my parents up here last time they came to visit
49,2129,Jul 24 2006	Everything about this place was perfect	Everything about this place was excellent
50,2129,Mar 18 2006	Just fine for our needs	I bring my family to SF once a year for our Memorial Day weekend San Francisco Zoo trip. Stayed here for 2 nights- very quaint &quot;old school&quot; type rooms
51,2129,Aug 28 2005	Home Away from Home	We found Ocean Park Motel by accident while looking for a place to stay while visiting our two daughters who are students at San Francisco State. Fell in love with the decor
52,2129,Jun 24 2005	Very nice near SFSU	There is little to choose from in this area of San Francisco
53,2129,Oct 30 2004	Great for the price	It's been a while since I've been there
54,2129,Sep 21 2004	Beach more relaxing than Wharf!	The location near the ocean beats the Wharf anyday! The garages protect your car from the salt air. Ocean Park is close to the Cliff House for a nice dinner overlooking the Pacific at sunset. Take your coffee and go for a walk on the beach--no better way to spend the early morning! Best sand dollar beach I've ever experienced!The rooms aren't fancy by any means--almost rustic--but the floor heating and almost-cabin look add to the charm and overall relaxing atmosphere. The secluded hot tub beneath the stars at night is a jewel! Great location for going to the zoo and right by the bus and trolley routes. We stayed at Ocean Park when I had a conference downtown--the drive was easy and parking at the convention was easier and cheaper than I expected. I was away from all the downtown big city experience. I had a convention on the beach and everyone else went to another big city!	
1,2131,Nov 24 2009 	Wonderful Place to Stay	We really enjoyed our time at the hotle. The service and food were wonderful. Our room was a good size and it was very clean. It located in a very good location and would def consider saying there again.
2,2131,"Nov 13 2009 	Outstanding service	I travel to San Francisco a couple of times each year and have been fairly loyal to the Hilton Financial District which has a great location and wonderful views. I have had drinks in the bar at the Omni and thought it was lovely. This time, I found a terrific weekend price at the Omni and decided to try it. It was a great decision. From the moment I walked in the door, the service was uniformly outstanding. The doorman asks for the name on the reservation - and from there, they hand you off, by name, from staff member to staff member. I was particularly impressed when the next morning, the bellman still referred to me by name - good memory! The room I had was probably not the best location, but I didn't expect their best room for the price I paid! The room itself was lovely, extremely well equipped. It faced inwardly to other rooms of the hotel and a nearby office, but frankly that was wonderful because it was extremely quiet for sleeping. The location of the Omni in the center of town does not lend itself to views in any case. When I checked in, they gave me door tags to hang each night with a requested beverage (coffee, tea, juice, etc) for the morning. What I particularly liked was that on the back, you could also order small breakfast items - muffins, yogurt, etc. for a very reasonable price rather then ordering an expensive breakfast from the room service menu. If you were happy enough with coffee and a muffin for breakfast, it was possible for a very small charge. All in all it was a lovely hotel, I hope I can find another fairly reasonable offering in the future, as I would love to stay again."
3,2131,"Nov 12 2009 	Fantastically wonderful!!!	Everything about the hotel is lovely! We were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and when we arrived they told us they'd upgraded us to a suite. It was a corner room and we had windows on both sides, a very nice sitting room, beautiful bathroom and huge bedroom. Everything about the room was first class. It was extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable. When we came back to the room after riding the cable cars around for a few hours there was a big piece of chocolate cake and a split of champagne waiting for us! We had dinner at Bob's, the hotels restaurant, and they gave us one of their intimate, private dining rooms. The food was wonderful! The hotel employees could not have been more helpful, welcoming and courteous. I can't say enough good things about our stay there and will definitely go back. I recommend it without hesitation!! Don't miss it, you'll love it!!!"
4,2131,"Nov 8 2009 	Amazing service location and comfort	We were totally wowed with the service and comfort of the Omni. We live in the Bay area and go to San Francisco every few weeks for fun in the city. We have stayed at several hotels, and this was by far the best experience we've had. We were given Express check-in, which was amazingly smooth. All of the staff is super friendly and accomodating. We ordered breakfast each morning (very yummy blueberry pancakes) and got coffee and the New York Times promptly at 8 am, as requested. The room was huge, quiet and the beds very comfy. The shower was so luxurious -- my husband is 6'5&quot;, so a high, large shower head is something he really appreciates. The workout facility was also very impressive - high-end treadmills, eliptical machines and free weights.The location is unbeatable -- right across from the Bank of America and a few short blocks from Union Square and the Embarcadero.You absolutely can't go wrong with the Omni!"
5,2131,"Nov 1 2009 	Once again--a wonderful experience at an Omni hotel	An absolutely beautiful hotel--a retrofitting of an old bank building. The location is perfectI got a great rate when I booked on line thru Omni and when I arrived I was pleasantly surprised to find out I had been upgraded to a one-bedroom suite--I can't say enough about the Select Guest Program at The Omni. A fleet of black Town Cars were waiting in front of the hotel to take you shopping, to restaurants, to the airport. The restaurant and bar are excellent as well. The suite was traditional in styling, and very elegant with a large walk-in marble shower. This is a perfect example of why I always stay at Omni hotels."
6,2131,"Oct 29 2009 	Excellent Value - Great Location	Traveled to San Francisco over the Labor Day weekend with my husband and another couple. We got a great deal on the rooms - prepay for $106 per nite. Never having stayed there I couldn't resist. I'm glad we took the deal. The Omni is in a fantastic location - China town just around the corner, short walks to embarcadero, Union Square, and the trolley runs right in front of the hotel. Tadiche's is only a block away (one of my favorite restaurants). The Carnelian Room is across the street in the Bank of America Bldg. (go quickly - it is set to close at the end of the year) on the 52nd floor, beautiful views of the Golden gate and the bay. Go for a sunset cocktail. It's an intimate room so try to be early for the best tables. The hotel itself could use a little updating. The rooms are big enough, just not very contemporary. A little old fashioned decor-wise. Everything perfectly clean. Comfy bed. The food was great at Bob's in the hotel (love Bob's - we know it from its origins in Dallas) and the scene at the hotel bar was lively. We went every day for an afternoon toddy. All in all a great trip. Don't miss Fisherman's Wharf and the bay cruise - interesting and beautiful. We had an absolutely perfect day. September really is the best weather there.Eat a bowl of chowder out of the fantastic sour dough. MMMM making me hungry!Would definitely stay at the Omni again."
7,2131,"Oct 26 2009 	Excellent Hotel - wish we could of stayed longer	My wife and I stayed at the Omni for 2 nights in Oct as part of a 2 week trip of the West Coast. We picked the Omni via the good reviews in trip advisor and were not disappointed. From the moment we entered the foyer we knew that the reviews were correct. Check in was quick and friendly, we had asked for a room with harbor views and a high floor and received both these requests. The room was good size with comfortable bed and loverly bathroom. We had room service the first night - which was delivered quickly and was of good quality. The dinner included a birthday cake and red wine for my wife. The cable cars run outside the hotel which is handy for trips to Fisherman's Wharf. Union Sq is about a 10 minute walk. Dinner the second night was in their Chop House restaurant , which is a must, especially for wine lovers as they have been voted as having one of the top 10 wine lists in the world. Steaks and Seafood were of high quality and service excellent. Our last stay was at the Monaco which was also good but at $100 night extra is not as good value as the Omni. We will certainly come back to Omni, next trip to the states."
8,2131,"Oct 25 2009 	Great Service	Picked the Omni after reading all of the reviews on TA. All as said before - great service, rooms, etc. In terms of location I didn't find it too far from Union Square, etc - 5-10 minute walk tops. I quite like the fact that it's in the financial district; means that local starbucks, cafe's etc are open nice and early for business (I'm a morning person!) although agree it's a little quieter in the evening once rush hour is over, but it's hardly dead.Walgreens, Mcdonalds, Starbucks and lots of cafe's are all within 100 metres of the hotel so you don't have to go far for anything.Would certainly recommend."
9,2131,Oct 24 2009 	Excellent Base in Financial District	This is an outstanding hotel with an excellent staff. The rooms have everything you need with very comfortable beds. The bar is quite pricey downstairs and their breakfast and room service prices are absolutely ridiculously expensive. They would sell a lot more of each of those categories if they didn't charge so much. The location is unbeatable (unless you have the scratch to stay in the Ritz.). Highly recommended.
10,2131,"Oct 22 2009 	Elegant hotel in SF	I like this hotel a lot! Very professional service, great food and good location. Omni is located in financial district on California Ave. You can walk to China Town; catch a cable car or a trolley. Our room was very clean, comfortable, and spacious, room service was always fast. I wish this hotel was part of Starwood or had some kind of reward program since it's not cheap. Another time I stayed in Le Meridien, just a few blocks away and I wish I was in Omni :) This is definitely great and beautiful hotel."
11,2131,"Oct 20 2009 	highly recommended	Really great place to stay in San Francisco. walking distance to cable cars, trolley, China town. The staff is incredible - very helpful and friendly. Beautiful hotel. I would definately stay here again."
12,2131,"Oct 18 2009 	Great hotel	Nice &amp; attentive costumer service in front desk and very funny and attentive bell boy. We had ordered a king deluxe and we got a very big room with extremely good and huge bed and a very nice view. Free wifi and if you become a member of their club, which is free, there is free coffee and such brought to your door in the morning. The location is also very good - i was afraid that we had ordered a room in the financial district because it often means empty and scary neighbourhood after business hours, but it was just on the edge of Union sq.It is a bit on the expensive side compared to us prizes, but we thought the money was well spent...The valet is like 50 bucks or something."
13,2131,"Oct 18 2009 	A Warn welcome To California	Following a long flight from the UK we arrived to a very warm welcome from the staff at the Omni. Check in was fast and loads of useful info was offered. The room was very comfortable. The bed had a memory foam topper which made it really comfortable. The toiletries were great and everything was spotless. We didn't have breakfast here as there is so much choice nearby, however the bar is a bit pricey for drinks and snacks compared to other bars. Overall a great choice in San Francisco."
14,2131,"Oct 13 2009 	A Jewel	This hotel is in financial district on California ave close to cable car, MUNI bus and trolley. The rooms are well appointed , the hotel staff are extremely out going. They know the area well and it's advised to ask for directions and input for dining etc. We enjoyed a relaxing stay and though it was our first experience staying at this hotel chain we cancelled our internary and stayed at Omni of LA,, Just a rubber stamp of what hotels should be and how staff obviously are in tune with helping there guests achieve the most out of there business or leisurely stay."
15,2131,"Oct 11 2009 	Wonderfully welcoming great location fantastic for our 1 yr old too..	This is a great 4 star hotel that we only used because it was the cheapest in its class on Expedia for the night we wanted. The hotel is in a great location - only 10 minutes walk from the Ferry Building in SF and an easy walk from the rest of the waterfront and loads of cafes and restaurants. The staff were kind and attentive - I know they're paid to be, but they went the extra mile with our little daughter. A kid's toy-pack was handed to her immediately we came through the door, and there were cookies and milk left along with her crib. The room was beautifully kept and equipped and was immaculate. We were very happy with this hotel and would definitely consider staying here again!"
16,2131,"Oct 9 2009 	Nicest hotel in the city!	We stayed here for the Emerald Bowl 2008. It was fantastic. The staff was wonderful and always more than willing to accomodate any need. Probably the best thing about the Omni is their &quot;club&quot; program. If you sign up, they deliver free coffee/tea/cocoa to your door every morning. We were in SF during my birthday and came back to the room after the game to find a little birthday cake and a small bottle of wine waiting for us. It truly made a great trup even more special!"
17,2131,"Oct 8 2009	Pricey small rooms great location.	Hotel lobby was nice. Room was small but clean. Bathroom was terrific and clean. Check-in was difficult. Reserved room several months in advance and requested room w/2 beds (traveling w/my adult daughter). Was given room w/1 king bed. Had to wait an hour for room to be reassigned. Was offered a coupon for a free breakfast to compensate for the inconvenience, but it was not offered until we were checking out and leaving for the airport! Consierge was very helpful and knowledgeable. Housing keeping staff were friendly and prompt. Restaurant was very expensive and food was not what was expected for the $$ charged."
18,2131,Oct 4 2009 	Awesome hotel!	We stayed here in August for 3 nights and absolutely loved it! Service was excellent...location good (quiet on weekends...) but close to shopping and restaurants. Highly recommend it!
19,2131,Oct 2 2009 	Great Hotel in a Great Location!!!	This is a Great Hotel in a Great Location!!! All of the staff members were the BEST!!! I will be back.
20,2131,"Oct 2 2009 	Excellent in every way	Attentive service, bordering on being too eager to help. Rooms are good size, with all the amenities. A plus for this hotel is a nicely appointed fitness center which is complimentary for guests. All in all, you will be quite happy here. Tip: Join the Omni Hotel frequent stay club, it entitles you to amenities including free newspapers, water, complimentary hot beverages delivered in the morning. Sign up is free. Another tip: Do not spend $48/night to valet park your car here. Best bet is not to have a car, if you must there are cheaper self-park alternatives (parking at corner of Sutter &amp; Stockton is a municipal garage)"
21,2131,"Oct 1 2009 	Had High Expectations and Omni Exceeded Them	I was in San Francisco for a conference and needed a room for 3 nights. I used a third party booker (starts with Price and ends with Line) and got an amazing deal on the Omni. I was very happy, because Omni is one of the highest ranked hotels in San Francisco. Now I know why.The Omni is located in the Financial District, which means its a fairly short distance from touristy spots such as Union Square, Embarcadero, Chinatown and Pier 39. It also seems relatively safe. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, both dinner style and grab something quick like Jamba Juice and Subway. Upon arrival, I realized Id forgotten my phone charger. The front desk clerk, seeing that I was a little upset, offered to check housekeeping for a loaner. Five minute later she came back with a charger and said I could use it for the duration of my stay. Her helpfulness plus the cheery, happy, glad-to-be-at-work vibe given off by the rest of the employees in lovely lobby got my stay off to a good start.I had to wait a half hour for my room, which was no big deal since Id arrived earlier than 3. One of the most cheerful porters Ive ever encountered took my bags and held them while I ran to get some lunch. When the room was ready, I was surprised at how large it was  especially considering Id booked third party. Omni didnt discriminate and attempt to put me in the broom closet, which to be honest, has happened only once at a different hotel where Id booked through the bargain booker.The room had a very long hallway  so long I could run laps back and forth. The bathroom was huge, the bed was big and comfy (as usual for Omni) and the room had a sofa, desk, chest of drawers and two flat screen TVs which could be adjusted so that I could view them from about any point in the room. The room didn't have a lot of light, but it didn't bother me, and the view was of people working in the offices in the building next door, which wasn't scenic, but slightly entertaining. As for the noise level, the only noise I ever heard coming from another room was a shower in a nearby bathroom. Overall, the room was very quiet.So the location was great, service was outstanding and the room exceeded my expectations.Room service prices were very, very expensive, but thats to be expected. However, I was able to order from the bar at the restaurant downstairs (Bobs) and take the food back up to the room. That cut the costs down tremendously and the cobb salad I ordered was excellent. Id love to go back to San Francisco for a longer stay at The Omni, and hopefully, with family. I read they have a kids suite with bunk beds attached to a king suite. Final Note: Omni's Internet was free to members. To be a member, you just sign up on their website or when you get to the hotel. It's free and you get free Internet access. The room I was in wasn't wireless, but they provided a cord and I didn't have any major issues getting or staying online."
22,2131,"Sep 29 2009 	Not perfect But a Good Stay and at a Reasonable Cost	My wife and I vacation in the Bay Area frequently. Given the number of top-notch hotels in The City, we usually pick and choose a new one each trip. This time we landed the Omni on a discount website for about $125 per night. Given all of the good reviews on Trip Advisor, we were excited to give it a try.The location of the hotel is better for business than leisure. While I like the Embarcadero area for its proximity to BART and the ferry building, we found ourselves constantly trudging up-hill toward Union Square or Pacific Heights for dinner and sightseeing. We do a lot of walking when staying in the City anyway, so the additional few blocks (all uphill) was a bit of overkill. In short, we largely prefer staying in Union Square and probably will skip the Omni because of its location on our next stay.All other aspects of the hotel were well above-average -- our check in went smoothly. The staff was attentive and pleasant. Our room was clean and comfortable, although very average in size and accommodations. The lobby area is attractive and the hotel is a very good mix of luxury and value. Overall, we found the Omni to be an excellent value and a good choice for a home base while staying in San Francisco. Our only complaint was the location, but for a business trip it would be perfect."
23,2131,Sep 27 2009 	Great location great servicefabulous breakfastexcellent value!	We stayed at 3 different hotels in San Francisco and this was by far the best value and a nice hotel with a good location. The room was spacious and comfortable. we were given through directions for locations we were seeking and good information on arrival. the price was very good.
24,2131,Sep 27 2009 	Very Nice	Our stay at the San Francisco Omni Hotel was excellent. The exterior of the hotel is very attractive and the interior is tastefully decorated. The rooms were nicely decorated; not too big and not too small. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is convenient to many tourist attractions and the trolley.
25,2131,"Sep 25 2009 	LOVED IT!	From the moment we got to the Omni hotel, eveything was perfect! My husband and I have never been to San Fran and we came with 5 others for fun. On the day we arrived we came in late from the airport and had 30 minutes to get to Pier 33 for the night Alcatraz tour. Thank goodness for Michael at the front desk, he not only checked us in, took all of our bags and had us all whisked away in time to make the tour. That was just the beginning! Every morning Joey at the font desk would greet us and ask whats on the agenda today. Well he made lots of suggestions and was very helpful in teaching us how to take the cable cars to the Piers, which was very easy. It picks you up right in front of the hotel and you take it to Powell street. On Powell you can either take the Hyde Cable car or the Mason. They both take you to the water at the different spots but the Hyde takes you to Lombard Street where you can get off and walk down the famous street and its only a couple of blocks to the Pier. For us taking the cable cars and walking around was the best way to see and experience the life down there. Parking would be crazy, so if your able to walk, that is what I recommend. We also did the Night cruise to Alcatraz. We bought our tickets a month in advance and believe me if we hadn't we would not of been able to go. It is definately worth the price and a great tour! We also top the Hop on Hop off Bus tour over the Golden Gate Bridge. It was ok I was a little disappointed that we got on the wrong bus and didn't get to go to Salsalito. Once your on they do no transfers so your stuck on the bus going where its going. It wasn't bad we went to the Exploratorium, the Presidio, over the bridge and the Pacific Heights Mansions. It was nice but really heard that Salsalito was a great town to go to! Other than that the Bread from Boudini's and the seafood is Awesome! We went to a show in North Beach, Beach Blanket Babylon and thought that it was great! Different, funny with great costumes and the humor was with all the current events that are going on today and Singing. If your up for a funny show you will have to get your tickets ahead of time for this too! Had no problems taking the BART to and from the airport. Hotel was just 5 blocks away. A special thanks to Joey and Michael at the Omni for always helping and going way out of their way to make our stay better! Definately planning a trip to go back with our kids next year and would definately stay at the Omni again! It was nice and quiet for us, the bed very comfortable (needs extra pillows, you can request) and the rooms very comfortable. Hope this helps!"
26,2131,Sep 23 2009 	Loud loud loud!	The Omni is a beautiful hotel in a great location. My wife and I stayed here as a treat and I thought it would be worth the cost. Unfortunately there was a loud wedding party when we were there. The hotel has an outdoor &quot;party patio&quot; on the third floor in the center of the building which just echoes and creates a terrible amount of noise. We had an early flight the next day and weren't able to sleep. I had to call several times to complain and beg to get moved to another room. Would I stay here again? Not a chance for 300 dollars.
27,2131,"Sep 20 2009 	So Glad I booked the Omni	Stayed at the Omni for 3 nights over the Labour Day Weekend based on Trip Advisor reviews. From the moment we stepped out of our taxis I knew we booked the right hotel. The hotel was beautiful, all the staff we fanastic from check in to bell boys, housekeeping were great asking us when passing in the corridor if we needed anything. A special thank you to Darryl at the door for the great service we received. Room was very clean and the bed was very confortable. Sign up to their guest programme on their web site as you get free internet, tea or coffee to your room every morning, newspaper etc. Would defintely stay again"
28,2131,"Sep 14 2009 	Loved it - and such a deal!	We stayed at the Omni for Labor Day weekend and it was terrific. The staff did everything possible to make our stay a pleasant one, with special kudos to Lex, the concierge, who so generously shared his knowledge with us. Our room was clean and very quiet, the bathrooms were large with plenty of amenities, the WIFI in the room acutally worked every time and the location was perfect for walking to the Ferry Building. And - the nightly rate was about half what we would have paid at comparable hotels in the neighborhood! Definitely join the (free) Loyalty program when booking to get a few extras. Note: valet parking is costly ($30 per day on weekends and $48 during the week) but necessary."
29,2131,"Sep 12 2009 	Working Vacations	This was an exercise in opulence. The room was gorgeous. the facilities were top notch and the hotel itself is centrally located just a stones throw from the financial district, and a great steak house on California Street ( I think it is). I even found a street vender that sld black roses..But that's another story.."
30,2131,"Sep 9 2009 	Absolutely fabulous	We found an outstanding price at the Omni San Francisco for Labor Day weekend. It is very centrally located so that we could (and did!) walk almost everywhere. The entire hotel staff from the door men, concierge, front desk, and housekeeping were friendly, helpful, and seemed to really enjoy working there. Our room was clean, cozy, and had a luxurious decor. We were very happy with our experience at the Omni and will definitely be back! We'll probably look for an Omni in other cities we travel too as well."
31,2131,"Sep 8 2009 	Great hotel and staff! We would definitely stay here again!	We stayed here over Labor Day Weekend and everything was fantastic! We called ahead to find out more about the BART system and the concierge, Tara was very helpful. Mass Transit is the way to go in San Fran! Of course you must take advantage of the infamous Trolley cars (NOTE: pick up the trolley in the morning one block down from the hotel. You can buy tickets on-board. Otherwise, you will wait nearly an hour to get on the trolley at Powell Street or at Ghiradelli Square. Don't forget the MUNI. It is great too!! We took the MUNI to Haight/Ashbury and walked to Golden Gate park. The BART is fantastic to go to and from the airport. It cost $16.20 round-trip from SFO to Montgomery Street. The hotel is 5 blocks from the BART station. Don't waste your money on a $50 cab fare one-way! Anyway, we were greeted by Justin who check us in. We did not have any issues with check-in as some other people had indicated in other reviews. Justin was very friendly and cordial. He recommended a restaurant close by (Tadich Grille) so we had a quick dinner. Justin called some tour companies for us as we wanted to see Alcatraz. NOTE: If you plan on seeing Alcatraz PLEASE book your tickets in advance. I had been to SF ten years ago and never had a problem getting tickets to Alcatraz. I was told SF is so popular now that Alcatraz is sometimes booked for 3 weeks! We ended up getting tickets but it was by pure luck!! If you want to book tickets in advance, the Alcatraz ticket agent told me to book on the official Alcatraz website NOT a broker. We saw people turned away because their tickets from a &quot;broker&quot; weren't valid. All of the staff were very friendly and knowledgable at the Omni. We booked a 21-day advance so we got the best rate. Albeit, the rooms were a little small but VERY nice. The bathrooms are very nice with granite countertops and VERY clean as well. The lobby was nice with complimentary coffee. The hotel is a short walk or trolley ride to Chinatown and North Beach (Little Italy). Please check out Calzones in North Beach. It's a great Italian restaurant. It sounds like a pizza place but it's not. They have great food! Albeit, I don't think you can go wrong at any of the Italian restaurants. They all have outdoor cafe style seating. The Omni is in the financial district so there isn't alot of nightlife (which we liked). It was very quiet at night. If you want a hotel closer to bars or entertainment you might want to find something closer to Union Square. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Omni very much and would definitely stay here again!!"
32,2131,"Sep 6 2009 	Uspscale hotel with a moderate price!	I did book this hotel through priceline, but wow what a great stay!! I have never been in a hotel with such nice staff from the doormen, to the concierge to the cleaning staff there has been a lot of attention to detail. The room was spacious, clean and well appointed with higher thread count sheets, marble and brass fixtures and 9 ft ceilings. Our room peeked at the Transamerica Building but also a gray roof top but who cares there is lots to few out of the hotel. Location was perfect as you were in a quieter part of town but close to everything too. The cable car ran out the front door and you are 5 - 10 minutes away from Union Square, Chinatown and the Embarcadero. We didn't go to the Restaurant as we thought the menu was stuffy and way way overpriced for what else is out there around you!"
33,2131,Sep 5 2009 	Elegant hotel with impeccable service.	This hotel far surpassed my expectations for the price. Beautiful lobby and rooms. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.
34,2131,"Sep 3 2009 	Good but nothing more than you'd expect at the price	We traveled to San Francisco as part of a tour of the Western USA during the summer and stayed for three nights at the Omni. The location is excellent and the valet parking (at a cost) very useful in a city where parking is tough to find. Chinatown is a 5 minute walk and the trams up Nob Hill leave from basically outside the front door. The staff are friendly, courteous and very good at making you feel at home. Food at the in house restaurant is also good - I can highly recommend the breakfast! However, for the price you pay the rooms are small and nothing special (though bathrooms are good) and I just can't bring myself to give somewhere this expensive 5/5 as in reality it's not great value for money. A very pleasant stay nonetheless."
35,2131,"Sep 2 2009 	Excellent location and good service	We selected the Omni based on TripAdvisors reviews - thanks to all of you who take the time to post your experiences!We loved the location of the hotel which is walking distance to Union Square, the Embarcadero, China Town, etc. It is a business hotel though so don't look out your window and expect a great view of the city. We did have a few little glitches upon arrival, but Sarah, at the front desk, was very very helpful and more than corrected the situations. The staff's restaurant recommendations were very good. Our experience in the hotel's restaurant was not good - so I agree with a previous post that you should eat elsewhere.I have to give Sarah, and the room staff a big thanks. I had left some medication in the refrig and called to see if they had found it. They did and even though they didn't think they could get it out on that Friday, somehow they managed and it arrived at my home the next morning by 10 am. I was so impressed. We will stay at the Omni on our next visit."
36,2131,"Sep 2 2009 	Old San Francisco Charmer	If you enjoy &quot;old school&quot; service and city elegance, you will love the Omni San Francisco. The decor is elegant and the service friendly and impeccable. From the moment we arrived, everyone on staff bent over backwards to accommodate every request and everyone down to the maintance guy in the hall had a cheerful greeting for you. The concierge, Lex ,was incredibley helpful. The room was well-appointed and the bed with crisp sheets and duvet very comfortable. Sign up for Omni' frequent stay program and enjoy benefits on your first stay including complimentary beverage (you can choose both coffee and juice/bottled water per person) and choice of newspaper delivered each morning at the time you choose. Yes - the bar and restaurant are on the expensive to the OMG side - especially if you dive into the steak menu at dinner ($54 for a veal chop - wow!) but have to say I had a wonderful burger in the bar one night and did not begrudge the $19 price tag because it was so good. Breakfast was also pricey (and not as outstanding) but you can add pastries, fruit and even a breakfast sandwich on to your complimentary breakfast beverage order for not too big a hit so we went that route and enjoyed a more affordable breakfast in our room. As for location, you cannot beat this spot for convenience to the Ferry Building, Union Square, China Town and all other points. Buy a three-day pass ($18) from the front desk and you can ride the trolley (stops right in front of the hotel), the vintage buses and regular buses to your hearts content. Also, if you plan to go to the Tut exhibit, ask the concierge if they have any leftover VIP passes. They cost a few bucks more but you can go whenever you want and bypass the long line by using the VIP line once inside the museum - you just have to promise the concierge that you will be discreet and not a big blowhard about having a VIP pass....."
37,2131,"Sep 2 2009 	I don't know other hotels but...	I suppose you'll get more comfort or luxury only at an even higher price...especially if you wanna stay close to Union Square.It's a 10 min. walk to Union Square and just around the corner of Chinatown so location is not bad but could be better. Rooms are very small and not offering much of a view, however, they are clean. The inhouse Restaurant is one of the best Steak houses in town and we liked it a lot! The staff is very friendly and helpful, they are used to tourists rather than business people and know everything about guided tours, rental cars (they act as an agent for Alamo/National) and so on. What I didn't get was the fact that they charge for the limo from the airport to the hotel some 130 bucks but when we asked for a cab from the hotel to the airport they offered the hotel limo for a flat fee of $50 -&gt; so you somehow feel ripped off about the first ride...If we would go to SF again we will definitely check other 4 star+ hotels aswell and try to find a good deal with some of the more well known brands. We picked the Omni mainly because of the good ratings here at tripadvisor and honestly, we haven't been really disappointed but expected more based on the very good ratings."
38,2131,"Sep 1 2009 	A Class Act......	The staff at the Omni is an efficient, attentive, and welcoming group of individuals. The check-in took 2 minutes and the woman who checked us in paid attention to the simplest detail. She noticed my dress on a hanger and asked if we were there for a wedding. We casually explained that we were celebrating our wedding with our family on the West Coast. Upon entering our room after a quick jaunt shopping, we found champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with a card in our room. The next day when my husband realized at the last possible moment that he needed his shoes shined, they were shined and returned in ten minutes! Every time we walked in we were greeted with a &quot;Hello&quot; and a smile by at least 3 staff members. If you want to be treated well in San Francisco you will be very happy here. Also, it is located in a great area which is convenient to many attractions, shopping, and restaurants."
39,2131,"Aug 31 2009 	an excellent option to visit san francisco	We spent 3 nights in this hotel, we make a 14 days in advance reservation and we got quite a good price.The location is really good, quite, you can walk to Union Square, Columbus Street and the Italian quarter, etc. You get coffee for free until 11 am but THEY CHARGE QUITE A LOT FOR INTERNET! This is something they should change and at least offer some minutes of cortesy if you are a guest in the hotel...Our room was really nice, big and SUPER CLEAN! Perhaps it's true that at the beginning we perceived a funny smell but we opened the windows and it was over after some hours.....If we visit San Francisco again, this hotel will be one of our first options for sure..."
40,2131,Aug 30 2009 	Excellent!	We were so pleased with our room and the staff were outstanding. Would come again. Very quiet and clean. Bed was so comfortable. They charge for internet.
41,2131,"Aug 26 2009 	not impressed	didn't like the hotel. lots of problems. room very small,carpets stained and worn out ,room service slow and forgetfull, noisy room, could hear everything from the next room. unfortunately I mean everything!!! Going back to the Le meridien"
42,2131,"Aug 21 2009 	Definitely #1 in San FRancisco	I have stayed in many top 4 and 5 star hotels in San Francisco and other large cities and this definitely one of the BEST I have ever stayed in. The lobby is wonderful, the rooms are large and tastefully decorated! My room included a great breakfast that could be served in the restaurant or my room and it was first rate.I hate to add this BUT:My only negative is the internet service that was a third party in house computer that was $5.95 for the first 15 minutes, this did not go with this first class hotel and needs to be replaced with a free service. They had a free service for airline check in that did not work--it took me about 8 tries to get one boarding pass printer, then I gave up!"
43,2131,Aug 21 2009 	All the positive reviews are right on. A great stay!	Booked the stay with my husband for one night to celebrate our anniversary - largely based on the great reviews I read here. I have to say - we agreed! Friendly and helpful staff. Clean and well-appointed rooms. Great location. Quiet. We had a wonderful visit and will definitely return.
44,2131,"Aug 20 2009 	Great Location and Exceptional Service!	Location - Perfect! Close to China Town, Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, etc.Service - Exceptional! Entire staff was remarkable!Room - Very clean and comfortable!"
45,2131,"Aug 19 2009 	This was even better than i expected!!!!	My husband and i stayed here for our two year anniversary, i chose this hotel because of all the wonderful reviews on trip advisor. Let me tell you, we were not dissapointed!!! from the minute we stepped out of our taxi we had doormen opening the doors, helping us with our bags and greeting us so warmly! Thecheck-in process was so quick i could have blinked and missed it! there were fresh flowers all over the lobby and it was so beautiful with all the marble an the crystal chandeliers. As we made our way up to the 16th floor(i had called beforehand and requested a view, our room viewed part of the building next to us but also a good view of the bay, we could see Alcatraz island from our room!) i noticed that even the elvator was nice, and i dont like elevators! When we got to our room, i was very excited becuase after looking at the hotel photos online i had seen a room decor that i really liked better than the others,an we were in that exact room! White sheets and comforter with gold accents in the room, beautiful! there was a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us, along witha card congradulating us on our anniversary. Even the beds exceeded my exepectations, i didnt think they would be so comfortable but i fell asleep so quickly and i didnt want to get up in the morning! we signed up for select guest, so we had coffee and tea delivered to our room each morning, and the coffee was really good! I would suggest getting breakfast at the little bagel shop right next door, they make really good breakfast sandwiches, but they were not open on sunday. We loved our stay here and we will definitely be back!!!"
46,2131,"Aug 18 2009 	Marvellous hotel in a marvellous location	Have just returned from the Omni San Francisco hotel, San Francisco. Selected it because of the previous excellent reviews on TripAdvisor, and this one will simply add to that list. This is a marvellous hotel in a marvellous location. Staff uniformly polite, helpful and knowledgeable (particularly the concierge staff). Rooms spacious, clean and very comfortable. Restaurants excellent, with plenty of outside alternatives nearby. Great location, with east access to cable cars, Fisherman's Wharf, China Town and North Beach (Little Italy). Only minor negative comment is the lack of a business centre (only a tiny room with 2 PCs that charge at $5 per 15 minutes) - but hardly a major issue. Highly recommended!"
47,2131,"Aug 18 2009 	The Omni blew us away!	From the second we walked in the hotel we were thrilled!! The front desk agents were friendly and efficient. As we made our way to our rooms, every employee we encountered was friendly and welcoming!! The rooms were very clean, the decor was nice and the bathrooms were lovely! Every time we left the hotel, the bellmen were a highlight, upbeat, friendly and at our service. The location is awesome, just a short walk to North Beach and Chinatown with easy access to the cable and street cars. I booked at the Omni for a weekend with 7 of my high school friends to celebrate our 40th. I signed up for the select guest program and we received comp beverages each morning. When we returned from our first day touring, they had put champagne, cake and chocolate covered strawberries in our room along with a lovely card!! It just started our trip with a bang and even without this we felt so welcome but this was over and above anything we could have expected!! I found a fabulous rate for all 8 of us on their website. They beat the rate of other luxury hotels by a long shot. We parked at St. Mary's around the corner and saved a mint.Between the employees and the beauty of the hotel, you won't go wrong with the Omni!!!"
48,2131,"Aug 17 2009 	Nice old style hotel near Chinatown	We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights at the end of a week long California trip. The hotel was very nicely furnished - lots of tassles and oriental carpeting. The room was ok in size, but we did not have a great view (looked out onto an office building). I was glad that we were 2 blocks from Chinatown, but I didn't like the downtown office location (no one really walking around at night). It is right across from the Bank of America building where you can go up to the top floor for drinks and a nice view of the city on a clear night.We had room service, which the kids really enjoyed. Food arrived quickly and was still hot when it came. We were going to have breakfast in the hotel dining room, but the $25 charge for 2 eggs and bacon changed our mind.This is a nice hotel - accomodating to families. I'm sure there are better bargains out there. Valet parking was $48/day."
49,2131,"Aug 14 2009 	Great stay!!!	Great hotel, wonderful staff, well located, great food, well maintained...what else can one ask for?!! 3 nights here and I had a wonderful time. Would come back here any time. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Will certainly recommend it. You have to have a meal at their main restaurant. It was a great experience. I had dinner on my first night and the service, food, wine, ambiance.....great!!!!!"
50,2131,"Aug 12 2009 	a bit oppressive?	we stayed in the omni for just one night at the end of a long holiday , there's no denying the rooms were spotless, the hotel beautiful and the staff super attentive. For us however it was almost too attentive to be comfortable . Our double queen room was pretty small ( smaller than the room we'd had in the francis drake at the start of our holiday) and at the end of a long corridor through a closed door which my daughter found 'spooky , large dark heavy furniture and heavy drapes ( including around the bath) didn't help'. The location though close to chinatown is very quiet for walking from in the evening. I am sure it's a perfect hotel for many but as a family who like convenience as well as comfort it wasn't right for us. If you like to travel by taxi, want to be looked after and don't mind paying the very high prices for 'extras' it's a great deal ."
51,2131,"Aug 12 2009 	Watch your car.	Because it was a last-minute trip, we booked with the Omni instead of our usual stop (The Ritz). Price was excellent compared to the Ritz and most of the employees were very friendly, especially the front desk and the doormen. But since this is a review to help us all travelers, here's our experience. When we first arrived there was no bellman or doorman. Only one valet person (we arrived at 6pm), who was &quot;forced&quot; to handle our bags. He didn't look too happy to have had to take care of our luggage when nobody answered his call (into his sleeve) for a bellman. We thought he could have at least hidden his displeasure of doing this. Location was right smack dab in the middle of downtown/financial district and they didn't have their own driveway. Since they are located in the corner, if there were a lot of cars in front of the hotel, you would be basically blocking traffic with your car. One last thing are the valet guys who would get our cars. Although there were great ones, there were also the occasional valet who would peel out of their garage (which was across the street) with our vehicle and make a very sharp and FAST u-turn with it in order to get to the front door of the hotel. Did not think that was professional and maybe management can have a reminder meeting with the valet about this. Mind you, we were right in front watching them drive our car recklessly."
52,2131,"Aug 12 2009 	Excellent stay for family of 4 with 2 toddlers	Can't fault them, if a bit pricey - but you get what you pay for. We had a 4 night stay, 2 during the week regular and 2 'family package' continued on. The hotel linked the bookings to avoid room changing. The room was well equipped, with double bed and enough space for our 2 travel cots. Breakfast was great but not included, fantastic blueberry pancakes - better than naff UK/European breakfasts! Again expensive but it is a quality hotel. We found the portions big enough to share. There was a kids menu as well inc. pancakes, which our 2 year old loved. Overall the hotel were very attentive to our kids, they received a baby bag (backpack) with plastic milk cup and some kids items. Again the kids loved it. For us we could use the cups supplied for free milk refills in the hotel restaurant so could avoid using room service or finding a grocery store for whole milk. We also ran into a lovely small kids playpark just uphill past the Fairmount - very useful to keep the kids entertained between our sightseeing schedule.If we return to SF the Omni will be our first choice again - great stay and location."
53,2131,"Aug 12 2009 	Wonderful hotel with superb staff and great location	We have just returned back from a trip to california for two and a half weeks.We chose the Omni SF for a three night stopover to savour the delights of San Francisco.Our choice of the Omni was based both on the wonderful experience we had last year in its sister the omni berkshire in new York and the excellent reviews kindly posted by other visitors to this hotel on trip advisor.And wow we were not dissapointed-from beginning to end the omni SF was excellent in every way .Astoundingly central location- walked everywhere ,to chinatown in five mins ,union square not much more,little italy in ten ,city lights book store and vesuvius bar in same.Brilliant and all safe to walk with no threat .The staff could only be described as superb and a credit to the Omni hotel .Welcoming ,accomodating ,helpful in every way and just generally cheerful and desiring to make our stay with them superb.From the concierge to the check in staff to the doormen and bell men they were outstanding.Our room was smart ,elegant and had everything we could ask for .Great downstairs bar too and lovely treats available for the kids to join us .It oozes class but not in an in your face way .Made our 19,17 and 13 year old kids feel comfortable without at all being ostentatious .This hotel has it in every way .Suffice to say two thinkgs.1...I would not hesitate to come back to this hotel or recommend it to anyone.and 2...it was so good that we will not stay anywhere but an omni whenever we visit the states again .If anyone from the Omni SF is reading this -take a bow -you were brilliant and made our holiday and stay in sf supremeA thousand thanks from a happy irish family .well done"
54,2131,Aug 12 2009 	Excellent service and personal attention	We traveled there on the last week of July on our first trip to San Francisco and were extremely pleased. The hotel lacks some amenities; but they make up for it with outstanding service and location. Would definitely visit again.
55,2131,"Aug 11 2009 	Enjoyed our Stay	Our stay at the Omni SF was great, we enjoyed the hospitable service and the location. Having the Cable Car right outside the door is definitely convenient and the Concierge recommended getting the 3-day pass ($18) which allowed us to ride the cable car/street car/bus system anywhere in the city. Our room was a bit noisy with the elevator adjacent, but we became accustomed to the humming sound. The room was large with a king-sized bed and a sofa sleeper for our pre-teen. We found the turn-down service inconsistent and our son only received his &quot;milk and cookies&quot; one night of the 4 we stayed. Maybe you had to be in the room when the housekeeper came by? Room Service and housekeeping service were very prompt and courteous when called upon."

57,2131,"Aug 9 2009 	Great Hotel great location great with kids	This hotel was right up there with the Ritz without the price. The staff was so nice, from booking the hotel to arriving and arranging cookies and milk to be delivered nightly to the kids. What a treat. The workout room was great. The trolly car stopped right out front. Considering we had children we decided it was good to ride the trolly car one day, but faster and cheaper to take a cap from that day forward. They have a store called Napa Ranch next door. Great for a small breakfast. Sear Fine Foods, up the street, was better for a large breakfast. The hotel staff was wonderful however, Taufique was very helpful. He helped with booking our rooms and making us feel welcome when we arrived weeks later. He helped with things to do and gave us great recommendations. From reservations to check out he was there. Thank you Taufique!!! The Omni in San Francisco made our week long trip great! Thanks again."

In spite of the fact that we were staying over a very busy weekend (the front-desk staff mentioned that the hotel was completely booked), everyone, from doormen to cleaning staff we happened to pass in the hall, was friendly, professional, and efficient. Our room met every expectation: it was exceptionally clean, spacious (for a hotel in the city), tastefully decorated, and had thoughtful little touches here and there  like the glass jar in the bathroom with sealed packets of cotton swabs and cotton balls, in case youd forgotten to pack your own. And even though the hotel was full, the room was exactly of the kind Id requested in my Select Guest profile. The room was also well soundproofed; once in a while wed hear a door opening or closing in the hallway, but mostly there was silence, broken only by the occasional, lovely sound of the cable car bell as it passed up California St.  The hotel is near the Financial District, which means that the area is quieter at night and on weekends. So if youre looking for something at the center of the citys action, then this is probably not for you. However, it was only a short distance away from the hubbub of the high-density tourist areas: about 10 minutes walking to Union Square &amp; shopping, around 20-30 minutes to the SFMOMA and Asian Art Museums, and also has easy access to streetcars, buses, and the BART subway system.  Hopefully theyll equip all rooms with wifi at some point. For now, its only available on a few floors (with higher-priced rooms), and upon arrival we had some inconvenient fumbling with cables and such before we got the internet running. But even with this little exception, Id love to stay here on my next visit to San Francisco!"
60,2131,"Aug 4 2009 	Gorgeous Great Location Excellent Staff Great Rate but Expensive Extras	I would recommend this hotel for overall quality, downtown location, excellent staff, and amazingly comfortable bed. But calculate your &quot;extras&quot; ahead of time. $48/night to park your car; $20 for two scoops of ice cream, $26pp for American breakfast."
61,2131,"Aug 4 2009 	Great location	My husband and I spent 3 nights there. This hotel is in a great location. It was a two minute walk to Chinatown or North Beach. We found that the staff was extremely friendly and the conceirge was exxtremely knowledgable and offered up some great restuarants for dinner. I highly reccommend joining the perks program for free. You won't then be charged for the internet and will get complimentary juice and coffee brought to your room in the morning with the newspaper. At night, they bring you cookies and milk. The room itself was on the smaller side, but it was clean and comfortable. It was not noisy at all. This is a great hotel and we would definitely stay here again!"
62,2131,"Aug 3 2009 	Great stay - thumbs up from our 2 year old.	This hotel is a great property to start with and then the staff adds a huge plus that few properties can match. We walked in the door with our two year old and one of the bellman rushed off and presented her with a &quot;special backpack&quot; filled with kids toys which was followed that evening by cookies and milk before bedtime, need less to say, our daughter was thrilled by the whole bit.For us, the hotel was located in an ideal location, not too busy, but easy to access the rest of the city via the California Cable Car line and any number of buses in addition to the trolleys and BART just a few blocks further away.The room was very pleasant and the bed was perfect, the only complaint at all was that we did get a bit of city noise through the windows, fortunately it was just enough to put and keep our daughter to sleep!All in all a real gem of a hotel in a fantastic city."
63,2131,"Jul 27 2009 	Loved it!!	The service at all levels was superb and the room was comfortable and clean and rather elegant. We paid $207 per night (AAA rate) and it was well worth it. In fact, if it was a &quot;view hotel&quot; (it overlooks downtown), it would have undoubtedly been half again as much if not more. Nothing is perfect but given what we paid and the fact that its a four-star (not five) hotel, I really have no complaints whatsoever and would stay there again in a heart beat. Definitely sign up for the Select Guest Loyalty Program; you can get a number of complimentary items that would otherwise incur a charge and there's nothing to lose by doing it."
64,2131,"Jul 23 2009 	Perfect Stay	My sisters and I spent three nights here. I have to say that it is the first time that we've had a flawless trip. The hotel, and all of the staff, were certainly well above what we expected. From the moment we arrived, we felt like we were royalty. The doormen, bell staff, front desk staff, and restaurant staff, were all very friendly and helpful. The room was nice and clean. The beds were very comfortable, and we hardly heard any noise. Housekeeping was very attentive, and did a fantastic job. The hotel restaurant was very nice and the food great. The hotel is located in the Financial District, and very convenient to San Francisco attractions. I highly recommend!"
65,2131,"Jul 23 2009 	Excellent Hotel	Stayed 5 nights in July at the Omni. Our room on the 17th floor was well appointed and very comfortable. Staff were extremely helpful, very knowledgable and nothing was too much effort for them.The hotel is ideally situated for exploring the city on foot or by bus. I am very fussy and could find no issue with this establishment.If booking a trip to Alcatraz Island do as we did and book well in advance from home to ensure you secure the dates you want."
66,2131,"Jul 23 2009 	Elegant Comfortable Excellent Staff Wonderful Stay	It is always important to do research about a hotel before you stay there. We (my husband, daughter and I) just spent a week at the Omni San Francisco Hotel. Having never been to SF, I wanted to stay in a nice luxury hotel with knowledgeable staff and we were not disappointed. The Hotel is located in the Financial District a short distance from the more chaotic tourist areas but easily accessible to world class shopping, eating, Fishermans Wharf , Chinatown and other scenic areas by walking, cable car, taxi, bus or rail. From the doorman, check in staff, bellman, concierge, housekeeping and restaurant, everyone warmly greeted us upon coming and going and always thanked us for staying with them. They went out of their way to be helpful with really good attitudes. We joined the select guest program for free (on their website) and this entitled us to FREE In-Room Internet Service, coffee/beverages of choice every morning, with a choice of 1 of 4 newspapers along with delivery of ice and turn down service in the evening. Upon making the reservation I mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday and when we arrived in our room, there was a card, birthday desert and bottle of chilled champagne waiting. We were in a regular room but I did request the top floor away from the elevator and got exactly what I asked for. The room was very clean - something I'm very picky about, beds were extremely comfortable and housekeeping service replaced our towels and promptly cleaned our room and bathroom every day when we left to go sightseeing. A concierge was usually available to make dinner reservations or tour arrangements, transportation and help with directions, areas to avoid, etc. They were always busy but always polite and willing to help. We ordered room service one evening and also ate in the hotel lounge. Delicious food and again great service. Bob's Chophouse, the main restaurant in the Hotel was very pricey so we chose to eat at more moderately priced meals in the different city districts. OTHER: Be prepared to tip. No pool. Nice fitness room. Good conference hotel. Family friendly. Parking is $48 per night, but if you have to have a car, there are a few less expensive garages nearby to park. No gift shop in the hotel but there is a little store next door you can buy drinks or get a snack, batteries, etc. Many of the little coffee shops are closed on the weekend in the financial district."
67,2131,Jul 21 2009 	bad restaurant no room window no wifi	The restaurant was bad. Stay away unless you're starving or just want a beer. It seems that some rooms look into a hole between the neighboring building and the hotel. The roof at the bottom of this hole is slanted so if you're unlucky you could get a room with a window that's blocked. And at the very least all of the rooms that look into this hole don't get any sunlight. They don't ave wifi. I've never stayed in the 4 star hotel that didn't have wifi - and they try to charge $10 a day for wired internet access - rip offffff.
68,2131,"Jul 20 2009 	What a great stay - Fabulous service lovely rooms quiet	I am delighted with our stay at the Omni Hotel. We felt looked after - like it was home. We had 4 nights there only 1 week ago. From the moment we pulled up and were greeted by Darrell the doorman, who was warm and humourous to my son, to the time we checked out, I give this hotel top marks. It was easily 4 star+. The service was excellent - the doormen, the front desk, the conceirges, the bellman. Nothing is too much trouble. There are complimentary drinks &amp; fruit in the late afternoons in the front lobby which we had when we checked in. It was the most welcoming check-in I think I have ever had. My son got milk &amp; cookies brought to our room as well.Our room was beautiful, with 2 queen beds and a marble bathroom. As we had one 11 year old child, it was big enough for the 3 of us, (we hadn't found that in some of our other accomodation whilst in the US.) It was quiet &amp; had dark enough curtains so we slept really well. It had great beds &amp; linen, free internet, complimentary tea and coffee and a mini bar. We got great advice when we asked for transport assistance or places to eat. The location of this hotel is great for catching cable cars &amp; getting to Union Square. It is in the financial district but that is one of the reasons it is classy and quiet after hours. (As opposed to Fishermans Wharf which was insanely noisy.) Even when we checked out, I had to wait in the lobby for 2 hours due to delays with our car rental. My luggage was supervised, I was checked on, I got the use of the phone at the conceige desk &amp; was even entertained. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel."
69,2131,"Jul 17 2009 	Wonderful Staff Great Location	Like everyone else, we loved San Francisco and can't wait to go back. I can only echo the other raves about the Omni San Francisco. The rooms are lovely, the staff goes above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable, problem-free, and comfortable. The location is fantastic. We didn't have room service but did have a steak in the restaurant, which was quite good and equal to most NY steak houses (except Peter Lugers for you steak lovers out there)."
70,2131,"Jul 17 2009 	beautiful relaxing catering and great location	My teenaged daughter and I stayed at the Omni for one evening before proceeding onto Palo Alto. This was our second stay at this Omni. From the moment you arrive, staff is outstanding and catering. They don't just talk service, they walk service! Fragrant flowers and a beautiful lobby greet guests. Our room was beautiful and quite clean. I would have given a five star (excellent) rating had it not been our room location, immediately off the elevators and on the Montgomery side. Guest noise from the elevators, a quite vocal and inebriated local shouting at the top of his lungs from midnight until 1am on the the Montgomery side and early morning (9am) vacuuming right outside our door (despite a privacy please sign), left us with a less than rest-filled evening. But, the location of this hotel (on the California trolley line), a short walk from the F line for quick access to the Wharf or, if you are inclined as were we, a longer scenic walk to the Wharf and onto Ghiradelli's, plus the hotel's catering staff and beautiful ambiance would lead me to it's doors yet again when I am in the San Francisco area. Also just a block away is a Walgreen's and, our favorite, Jamba Juice! A $50 per night parking fee (for your car) seems high but is likely the going rate."
71,2131,"Jul 16 2009 	Violently ill after eating room service breakfast	My husband and I spent our 12th anniversary here, and we both became violently ill the morning of our anniversary after eating the room service breakfast. We were sick for days afterward. They were nice at the desk (although they offered nothing for our trouble through Omni management when I told them what happened--just, oh sorry to hear it) and the room was fine, but we won't stay there again, not when there are so many great hotels in San Francisco that don't make you sick."
72,2131,Jul 16 2009 	An excellent hotel	Along with many other reviewers we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 day stay at both this hotel and in SFO itself. The service was excellent and everyone was most attentive at all times. We just had standard rooms but that means they were by no means ordinary and well up to 4 or even 5 star standards. The concierge was most helpful and made several reservations for us. The hotel has an excellent steak restaurant by all accounts but we did not go there but if you do want a tip for a quite magnificent steak then go to The Harris Restaurant. It's a short taxi ride but well worth the trip and the food is quite magnificent. I can heartily recommend the 49 steak if you have a good appetite.I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.
73,2131,"Jul 11 2009 	5 Stars all the way	I loved this hotel. It's officially a four star but it's significantly better than may 5* hotels I've stayed in. It's almost at four seasons level for service and quality of amenities. The hotel is located on California street which is close to all the best of downtown San Francisco and it's lovely to come out of the hotel and see the historic cable cars rolling by. The public areas are very nicely finished and fell very luxurious. The welcome from the staff was also very warm. The room was a nice size and the bathroom was really beautiful. The bed was also extremely comfortable. The hotel has free wifi also which is welcome. On checkout, everything went smoothly and the door staff were very helpful. I booked this hotel on hotwire and it only cost $120 for the night. This was an absolute bargain for a hotel of this standard. Can't wait to go back!"
74,2131,"Jul 10 2009 	Amazing stay and incredible service	I agree with most of the previous reviews. We stayed 2 nights and did decide to go for the signature room which was beautiful. We were greeted at the curb upon arrival by friendly staff who we found helpful throughout the entire stay. They freely offered us suggestions, all of which we took. The guy who brought our bags up suggested a good breakfast place within walking distance and a place within easy walking distance where we could go for drinks at sunset before dinner that had a romantic panoramic view. The hotel is also right around the corner from Chinatown and the weather was nice so we were able to walk there and do some shopping.We had dinner (Filet and Sea Bass, both very good) at Bob's Steak &amp; Chop House at the hotel which I recommend if you're not on a budget. Room service was also good.The only thing we didn't like about this hotel was the parking charge."
75,2131,"Jul 8 2009 	Awesome Experience at the Omni	The Omni is an amazing hotel. While the hotel itself is very luxurious, the staff, especially Sarah at the front desk, really set the Omni apart. They are unfailingly polite, helpful, smiling and enthusiastic to serve. Do yourself a favor and stay here. Everything works and the staff are really intent on making your stay at the Omni and in San Francisco something you will always remember."
76,2131,"Jul 8 2009 	Best Service in the City	This is our second visit to the Omni - the first time we were singularly impressed but thought perhaps we just got lucky. On this second visit, it was confirmed this is one of the best hotels in the City! The staff is dedicated, well-trained, genuinely friendly and helpful. They seemed sincerely interested in attending to your every need. The rooms were sparkling clean and well-appointed. The service, however, is what sets the Omni head and shoulders apart from other San Francisco hotels - much better than we received at The Palace, for example. We only stayed one night this second time, but this will be our hotel of choice on our next visit, and we are also so pleased that we are hoping to hold our next corporate retreat at the Omni."
77,2131,"Jul 7 2009 	If I Could Rate This Hotel More Than 5 Stars I Would!	I have been to San Francisco several times and have stayed in various hotels in the Union Square / Financial District area. We purchased this hotel through Priceline for the 3rd &amp; 4th of July for $100.00 per night. We were upgraded to a top floor room with bay view at no extra cost. Unbelievable seeing as we had booked the room at such a discount. I signed up for the Omni Club prior to our arrival so we were able to get a pot of coffee and juice at no charge to our room each morning of our stay. Our room was huge with a comfortable king bed &amp; 2 flat screen TV's. You can save approximately $20.00 per day by parking your car in the St. Mary's Square Parking Garage (about a 2 minute walk from the hotel) rather than using the valet parking. The location was perfect. 5 minutes to China Town, 10 to Union Square and 15 to the Ferry Building. I highly recommend this hotel!!!"
78,2131,"Jul 6 2009 	A Fantastic Start To A Wonderful Honeymoon	We experienced a fantastic welcome from the staff from the very moment we stepped in the hotel after a very long flight from the UK. Fortunately for us, as we were honeymooning we were upgraded to a suite but the whole ambience of the hotel was wonderful. The hotel is ideally located, and main attractions are easily reached by either walking, tram or a short cab ride. I can only report positive things about this hotel, and was very sad to leave on the next leg of our journey."
79,2131,"Jul 1 2009 	Nice ""grown up"" hotel...but great for kids too!	I am often surprised by how the nicer hotels make children feel unwelcome. I know some kids are noisy and unruly, but for the most part well disciplined children shouldn't be made to feel like they don't belong.The Omni was the exact opposite. Upon our arrival, we were greeted at the door by a friendly lady who presented little goodie bags to my two boys. Nothing fancy, but one of the toys in there kept my 6 year old son busy for much of our trip. It was a very nice touch. Also the cookies and milk left in our room the first night was very sweet.The hotel is beautiful, nice clean rooms and has a great staff. I would definitely stay here again."
80,2131,"Jun 30 2009 	Trust the Trip Advisor Rating--Great hotel	Half of the time I dont trust a ranking on Trip Advisor. Everyone has a different opinion on what is important: free breakfast, spa services, pool, and parking. But we got a good rate at this hotel for a long weekend and I must say it deserves its high ranking. The rooms were very clean. The staff is excellent(I swear they were so polite and sorry when their cleaning carts were in the hall) front desk, bellmen, and front door people helping with the cars. The beds were comfortable, sheets and towels first rate. Big quiet room, except for the trolley car that runs outsidebut once the noise was identified did not keep us awake. The other things that were high lights--- NO fluorescent bulbs, an actually 3-way regular light bulb so you could see to read. NO annoying cards asking you to save the planet and the hotel money by not washing your sheets and towels. A small spray starch bottle that came with a charge but it was appreciated. Not having to sign for coffee service. My husband is a member of the Omni club, and it is easy to join and you get some freebieslike newspapers and coffee. The only thing I can complain about is that the room didnt have wifiso only one laptop could be used with the modem in the desk."
81,2131,"Jun 30 2009 	Wonderful	Just want I expect from the Omni! Great service, super location, first class room. A real value for the price I paid."
82,2131,"Jun 25 2009 	Great Experience	From the warm greeting when we walked in to the helpfulness of the staff when we left, I felt that this truly is a 4 star hotel. The location is in the business district, 4 blocks from the BART line which we took in from the airport. It is close to cable cars, street cars and buses. We were there to visit the art academy so it was very convenient for that and not far from the Ferry building, China town and some great restaurants. It is very quiet on weekends also, due to office buildings being closed and felt very safe. Our room was spacious, modern and clean, well appointed and nicely decorated. The room temp can be controlled with your own thermostat and the bathroom was modern and spacious. They offered free coffee and newspapers in the bar every morning and fresh fruit and fruit water every afternoon in the lobby. (Also free jelly candies next to the bar). We went to the bar to have drinks and left, thought the drinks were a little pricey ($15 martinis) and went up the street to the Vesuvio, next to the City Lights bookstore. We checked out at 10 and they offered to store our bags since our flight was later in the evening. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to my friends."
83,2131,"Jun 20 2009 	Great Location and Amazing service	This is a great location at the corner of Montgomery and California, directly across from the Wells Fargo headquarters. Hotel bar made me a killer Mojito, but it was a bit pricey at $14. Room rate was $200/night.My colleague was able to get his shirt dry cleaned at 10:00pm after spilling some red wine...he picked it up in the lobby the next morning at 9:00am. I can't think of ever having been able to expect that kind of service before.Take a taxi to the Embarcadero at night for about $10 each way, there are some great restaurants on the water."
84,2131,"Jun 17 2009 	The best place to stay in one of the best places to visit.	A great hotel in a great location: its only a five minute walk to Chinatown, a five minute walk to the shopping district and about 15 minutes to the ferry building (next to Pier 1). If youre going further afield there is a tram stop directly outside the hotel and the regular bus service stops can be found within a block. The lobby and reception area of the Omni were modern and tastefully appointed, a theme which was followed through to the bar and restaurant areas. The hotel room itself was spacious, clean and fairly well appointed with nice decor, a modern flat screen LCD TV and cordless phone. The only negative point was that the housekeeping service seemed a little off the pace with drinking glasses not being replaced with clean items and in-room tea &amp; coffee making facilities that were never fully replenished - I lost count how many calls I made downstairs in order to resolve these little niggles. Apart from that, the service given by the rest of the Omnis staff was first class. Highly recommended."
85,2131,"Jun 16 2009	The Omni has it all.	I recently got back from a trip through California with my mom. At the end of our trip we stayed 3 nights at the Omni. It was the BEST of all the hotels we stayed at and I feel I booked some nice hotels. There was always a doorman and Darryl is the best of ALL. They were polite and would say welcome back. Darryl would even ask how your outing was. The front desk always said hello to me and my mom as we descended the stairs in the lobby. The room was clean and comfortable. The bath was very nice indeed. The room service was excellent in taste and value. My mom liked the tea they used so much I had to go online to order some for her. I personally loved the blueberry muffins with honey. Some people might say $4 plus tax and gratuity is expensive but go try to buy one at another establishment. It would cost about the same and is not near the quality or quantity. I have traveled coast to coast about 45 times and abroad twice, some was business and some pleasure. Some of the hotel/motels cost $40 a night and some $500. In those stays I have NEVER encountered the service as I did at the Omni San Francisco.I even took mom inside 3 big name hotels at the Wharf to compare our value and we knew we had made the right decision immediately. None of the hotels had a doorman available, the concierge was either aloof or rude (and yes I asked for 'directions'), and no one said hello as we entered. Also, when we left, I noticed there was no one to call a cab.I will say that we got spoiled on a refrigerator to store goodies in along our trip - as the Omni has items stored in theirs to buy, but it is overall TRIVIAL and I can't see myself staying anywhere else the next time I visit San Francisco.Lastly, yYou must try Bob's Chop House in the hotel. My mom had the Halibut which she said was better than a leading restaurant we ate at the night before. I had the crab cakes. They were excellent and I must say that the scallop potatoes with onions and peppercorn gravy served with a huge glazed carrot was superb.Thanks for a wonderful stay. My mom said it was her highlight hotel."
86,2131,"Jun 8 2009 	Wonderful start to finish!	Check-in was quick and friendly. Great staff-doormen, front desk,housekeeping etc.The concierge went &quot;above and beyond&quot; to make arrangements for us to tour the city in a helicopter. The room (California Suite) #720 was great. Corner room with floor to ceiling windows. Bed and linens were way above average quality. Room safe simple to use. Most anything you might need was in the room.Robes,even an umbrella, but thankfully it did not rain. Did not eat here, so I can't comment on the food. Small business center available for printing boarding passes etc. Overall a top rate, first class hotel. Can't imagine ever staying anywhere else in San Francisco!"

Great front desk help."
88,2131,"Jun 6 2009 	Great customer care at a wonderful location	I just finished my first stay in an Omni Hotel, and I am very impressed. This San Francisco hotel is marvelously located because you can easily walk to Chinatown, North Beach (the Italian part of town), the Westfield mall, Curran theatre, the Embarcadero &amp; Ferry Building, etc. The trolley runs by the front door. And of course, there is a Starbucks every half block and a Jamba Juice nearby so you can get coffee as well as an oatmeal breakfast.The beds are very comfortable, the bathroom counters spacious, and bathrobes are provided. If you ask for a wake-up call, a real person calls you in the morning. The front desk is efficient and friendly. The doormen and valets are the same. The fitness center is well-equipped with Precor equipment including 5 treadmills, 2 recumbent bicycles, and several ellipticals.The key to having a really great stay is to join the Omni Select Guest program. Then you get internet free, and they deliver the NYT or WSJ in the morning along with coffee and juice. The downsides to this hotel are (1) parking with tax is about $54 per night, but that's pretty much a standard SF hotel rate. (2) The furnishings in the room are not top notch. The wall decor is pretty sparse, the Sharp flat panel TV has the slowest channel changer I've seen in a long time, and the nightstands are flimsy. (3) The rooms only have wired internet access. Wireless is only available in the lobby."
89,2131,Jun 1 2009 	One of the Best experiences ever.	Thanks so much to the entire team at the Omni. We celebrated our anniversary at this hotel and what an experience. The hotel was beautiful and the customer service was perfect. I would recommend to anyone traveling and wanting to be treated like family.. we have always stayed at the Hyatt or Marriott. We will be back.. Thanks again....
90,2131,"May 31 2009 	Ideal location if you have young children	this hotel is comfortable, very clean, and well located in san francisco. We have three young children and our room had two double beds and a double sofa bed which meant we all slept comfortably with lots of room. We had two tvs/desk/safe/mini bar etc and an amazing bathroom with marble fittings. This hotel is quiet at night at the weekend and the financial area is clean and well maintained. Yet the cable car runs infront of the hotel/china town begins behind the hotel/union square is a 15min walk to the right and the ferry building/coit tower steps and the piers are roughly a 15min walk to the left. Seven minutes exactly straight on takes you to Market St and lots more Muni bus/Bart options. I have read on the forum that this location is not favourable but i totally disagree. Union Square was so noisy and with a tramp on almost every corner was not for young children. Fishermans Wharf was great if you like a Blackpool type area - we were glad we didnt stay there. If you like to be close but not too close to the main areas this is for you. Extra children's goodies included backpack with goodies in and first night cookies and milk. Tips negotiate a parking deal for around $30pn or park opposite sat/sun till 4am only for $7 per day. Join select guests to get free internet and coffee/juice in the morning. Could be improved by milk cookies every night for kids see their disappointed face when you get in on the second night and its not there - cruel. Cheaper parking automatically when you book why should you have to bargain for it!"
91,2131,"May 29 2009 	Very Nice Clean and a Great Location	We were in San Francisco May 21-26, 2009. The Omni Hotel, San Francisco was a great choice of hotel for us as this was our firt trip to San Francisco. We found it to be conveniently located, nicely decorated, polite and professional staff - and most import - clean, well maintained and really comfortable beds in the rooms! Staff was very helpful, and went out of their way to make sure that they were of assistance to us. You can walk to many of the city's attractions from this hotel (the hills are a killer!!) and the California Line trolley is right outside the door, walking distance to BART (which we took from the airport for $5.35 per person without any problem) and nearby to China Town and Union Square. One small drawback - the steakhouse- Bob's was very pricey and while we expected that to be the case, the food was really not quite up to the prices they charged. It was very good, the wait staff was wonderful. I would say the food, while the quality of it was above average, but certainly not outstanding and worth the price of the meal we had there. But, all in all, it was a very nice stay and I would most certainly stay at the Omni again."
92,2131,"May 24 2009 	Nice Potential But Has Issues	I have always liked this hotel, upscale atmosphere, great location, very good initial service, the door men are first class, and have stayed here previously, but during this visit things have gone tremendously DOWN HILL. First day, an interruptive knock on the door from a supervisory male housekeeping member to issue two packets of coffee to the room (oh please...obviously don't entrust the maids?) Should I now be concerned about theft of my own belongings?Second day, I return to the room to see ONLY a white sheet on my bed with the comforter on the floor and pillows and duvet stacked on my chair (thought the maids were not done yet). Not the appealing grand entrance you want to make in a four-star hotel room you expect to relax in...thought I was back at my college dorm. Complained to the desk, but find out this is the daily policy...and they falsely claimed it was the &quot;turn down service&quot; and I was the first of the day (at 3pm???)...caught them in a lie because the bed is never made up once you check in...their turn down service simply folds the corner of your sheet over....and no chocolate mints or anything typical of virtually every other hotel chain. The comforter stays on the floor during your entire visit. So, you will have to move all the pillows and duvet off the chair so you have a place to sit down (likely throwing them on the floor due to the small rooms. So, don't bring visitors to your room....is really a poor first impression. I also notice there are LOTS of long black hairs all over the bathroom (shower tub, walls, floor)...likely from the maids. Thought it was a fluke, but the trend continued throughout the stay.Next day, I notice that they are not replenishing my shampoo in the bathroom...an embarrassment for an upscale hotel and I feel like they are skimping on me to save money. I'm too embarrassed for them to make an issue of it and fortunately I had some stashed away deep in my travel bag. Now feeling that I am in a two or three star hotel.If you stay here, join the Select Guest club, as you'll receive complimentary internet service in your room and beverage room service every morning. Just an FYI...there are no exhaust fans in the bathrooms (probably due to the age of the building).I won't be returning, as there are better options for the money."
93,2131,May 8 2009 	Excellent Hotel!	We completed our honeymoon in San Francisco and looked forever to find the perfect hotel! We couldn't ask for a better find! From the moment we arrived the doorman kindly greeted us and wouldn't let us carry a thing! The hotel is absolutely beautiful (the lobby and the rooms). The location is perfect...easy walk to many fun spots. We will definitely be staying here again!
94,2131,May 5 2009 	Service	The Omni staff is professional. They have courtesy down to a science. Our stay was too short. We have found our favorite hotel in San Francisco.
95,2131,May 4 2009 	Could Not Have Picked a Better Hotel	The hotel has the feel of a grand hotel. Its location is perfect. We got the kids suite after reading about it on this site. Its an adjoining suite with bunk beds and a puppet theater and kids sized robes and bathroom. MY KIDS LOVED IT and so did we. The charge for parking is ridiculous- but if you park across the street at St. Mary's it was only $7.00. Everyone in the hotel is super friendly and really professional.
96,2131,"May 4 2009 	One of the Better Hotels in SF	I love this hotel. I come to San Francisco several times a year for work. I either stay at the Hilton, Financial District or Omni. My preference is the Omni. The view at the Hilton is better, but the Omni is more QUIET, clean and friendly. The service is far better than the Hilton. The rooms at the Omni do not have a modern feel, but the beds are extremely comfortable, and the bathrooms are extremely clean. The lobby is very impressive.However, I do have two complaints. The parking at the hotel is $50. If you do not need a car, do not drive to this hotel. Besides, the cable cars are right outside the hotel, or you can walk to many sights. The other complaint is that there is no shopping around the hotel. Everytime I come to San Francisco, I have a long shopping list from friends and family. After working all day, I don't want to travel too far to buy gifts. My wife is a chocolate and wine freak, and I have to walk over to Kearny and Jackson Street to buy Napa wines from this California shop."
97,2131,"May 4 2009 	Beautiful old hotel in the financial district	The Omni is an 'old world' style hotel in the heart of the financial district. The building is lovely and the staff is absolutely fantastic. I found my room to be fairly large and the bathroom was hugh. All of it was well-appointed though the decor could use a bit of an update as it looks a little old or stale. Overall, I would definitely stay here again though perhaps not on a weekend as the area is pretty quiet outside of business hours."
98,2131,"May 4 2009 	Helpful staff - great location	We stayed seven nights at the hotel. The staff were courteous and helpful giving hints and tips on what to see and where to shop. Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. Location is excellant near the Ferry Building, Chinatown and the main shopping area with good transport links. Only downside was the first meal in the hotel restaurant - expensive and not particularly tasty but lots of excellant restaurants nearby - especially Perbacco and Kokkari Esatoria."
99,2131,"Apr 27 2009 	Loved it!	I spent a week at the Omni in SF and loved every minute of it. Worst part was the wedding party that got a little rowdy in the elevators, but my room was peaceful the entire time. Location was convenient to the Financial District. Breakfast was placed in front of my door every morning so that I could eat it when I wished but was not woken up by room service if I needed more sleep. Fitness center was all mine every day. Parking was a problem as there is none. I had to use a public lot. Room was smallish but elegant. I understand this hotel charges a lot more $$$ than it used to. For under $250/night it is a steal. Over that, I might consider somewhere else."
100,2131,Apr 21 2009 	Excellent service	We stayed for 4 nights in April and had a fantasttic time. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The doormen (particularly Barney) were very helpful - more like a concierge service. Bar and restaurant were a bit pricey but the food was very good and we really did not get the carrot thing! If we ever visit SF again we will be back.
101,2131,"Apr 17 2009 	great hotel and location	Just got back from San Fran. with husband and two children. Omni staff was helpful and very nice. Our room although on the small size (but expected that w/ a hotel) was veryclean and the bathroom was spotless and large enough for our family. The locationsuited us just fine..no big hills to deal with when grabbing a quick bite for breakfast and easy enough with the baby in stroller. The complimentary starbucks coffee in the morning was a plus. We were close to everything and it was easy to get everywhere..we toured the whole city (mostly by foot..we live in NYC so are used to walking!) Again, the staff was extremely helpful especially when we rented a car and they helped us lug our car seat and stroller to the car. We were very very happy with our stay at the Omni!"
102,2131,"Apr 16 2009 	Best Hotel experience in years!	We stayed at this hotel beased on Trip Advisor rating and joined OMNI Express on advance of you stay-concierge John was fantastic; room was impeccable, comfortable and quiet; every one at the hotel is friendly- Daryl the bell captain also very helpful.Every recommendation a winner! We recommend joining Omni Express for the amazing amenities including morning cofee and orange juice as well as paper delivered to your room. San Francisco is a great tourist destination-Omni is in the heart of everything important and it 's hospitality makes San Francisco even better!"
103,2131,"Apr 9 2009 	Beautiful Elegant Hotel	Enjoyed the stay at this hotel only bad thing I can say is the parking fee $50 from memory. Staff wonderful , rooms clean. In a business part of town walking distance to Chinatown but not close to Fishermans Wharf."
104,2131,"Mar 28 2009 	Home Away From Home (or better)	Everything about the Omni is elegant. The lobby, the elevators, the hallways are, to me, much like coming home to an elegant townhouse. The staff is excellent, the rooms are heaven. I don't often write reviews, but as I sit here in my room I just felt compelled to do so."
105,2131,"Mar 21 2009 	Nice nice nice	I got in very, very, late due to a late flight.Even though it was late, staff was there to help me with my suitcase and with the door. Very, very good staff, and staff involved in the event were top shelf. Event catering was great, and the food was good!Great room with a great bed. Turndown service is standard, and staff leaves little notes on the stationary (using my name) wishing me a good day.In-room internet is free if you sign up for the loyalty program.If you're going to stay in San Francisco, stay here!"
106,2131,"Mar 20 2009 	Great location service and room in San Francisco	We stayed at htis hotel for the 2nd time and it was as outstanding as our first visit. The location is great, within walking distance of everything and right on the cable car line. We booked a king room adjoining a kids fantasy suite. The kids room was outfitted by Pottery Barn. It had a set of twin bunk beds with kids bedding, blankets, quilts, etc. Bean bags, a comfy chair, a small couch, books, stuffed animals, small table and chairs, mini fridge with kid amenities all reasonably priced, stools for bathroom counters and mini robes. The doormen, Barney &amp; Hugo, are very kind and helpful. The service at this hotel is very attentive. Rooms is sapcious and clean. If you stay in a room that does not face California street it is really quiet.Omni select member program provides dailey beverage and paper each morning, They also have a small breakfast selection that can be delivered with your beverage and it is less money and good quality for room service. Upon check in kids can receive fun bags. This is mostly a business hotel but has some amenities for families and is accomodating yet not over run with kids everywhere. You can walk three blocks to Chinatown, we walked all the way up and down Columbus to the Pier and visited parks along the way. Union square is about a seven block walk. I would recommend the California Academy of Sciences as a 1/2 day event. It is the new aquarium, rainforest, museum, planetarium and living rooftop exhibit.Great restaurants in the area: Hang An for chinese food on Clay, NorthBeach pizza delivers to the hotel, there is now a Cheesecake Factory in Union square, and many great Italian Places in North Beach to eat. Tried Tadich Grill, recommended as local spot near hotel....server was snooty, food was just average, prices very high. The steak was good but not worth the price."
107,2131,"Mar 14 2009 	Perfection!	I just completed a 3 night stay at the Omni hotel for a business conference. I have to say with being on the road some 150+ nights a year, I was very impressed with this hotel. Check inn was very fast and friendly. The room was spotless with arguably one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. The bathroom was nice with a tall shower, good water pressure and just hot enough. The internet for now is a LAN cable however they are upgrading to wireless and should be done soon. Our conference was on the 3rd floor and the staff were great. In fact every employee I ran into said something to me Hi, Good morning, Good afternoon while using my last name. The bellman out front were always opening the door for you and helpful for any information you may need. I would like to point out that parking valet is expensive at $50.00 per day. You really do not need a car with this hotel's location. China town is steps away or if you prefer other places to eat several are around the hotel and very good. Checkout was smooth at 615AM with the bellman very friendly. Hot coffee was being served in the lobby. Overall I highly suggest this hotel. As I stated above, I am a road warrior and was very happy with my stay at the Omni San Francisco!"
108,2131,"Feb 23 2009 	Perfect Stay....Kid Friedly too	My fiancee and daughter decided to all go together for a quick 1 day trip up to SF for business. My daughter (who is 7) had never been on a business trip with her dad or San Francisco for that matter...so I decided to try and find a place that was kid friendly. After searching many hotels I decided to try out the Kids Suite at the Omni. It was also located across the street from my meeting so it made sense at the time. As suites go the rate was comparable....as to value....priceless!!! When we arrived, the front desk described to me the way the suite was laid out...essentially two rooms joining each other through a common door. When we came upstairs and my daughter opened her room...she walked in with amazement. Bunk beds, stuffed animals, overstuffed couch, books, kid mini bar, bean bags, and the list goes on. She was immediately at home...and smiling...which made us smile.The next day when we decided to check out, we mentioned to the front desk how wonderful our stay was....and told them about Rufus...the stuffed dog my daughter fell in love with....a good touch to keep kids happy. We left to tour China town...about 3 hours later we returned and Justin (who was working the front desk at the time) noticed we came back for our bags...and when my fiancee came through the lobby about 10 minutes later before we got into the hotel limo...Justin handed her a key to the room and told her to go back upstairs and get &quot;Rufus&quot; the dog.....his reasoning was quite simple.&quot;WE WANT OUR GUESTS TO BE PERFECTLY HAPPY&quot;What a great way to end the trip. My daughter loves that dog....it made her experience in SF unforgetable...and we came home with a nice souvenir.We have decided the OMNI is our new home base in SF....Thanks again Justin."
109,2131,"Feb 18 2009 	Valentine's Day San Francisco Treat	My boyfriend and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day at the Omni San Francisco! We stayed in a gorgeous and spacious deluxe King room with City views. The room was beautifully appointed, and the bed was plush and comfortable! I loved the personalized welcome note from Marina the housekeeper. The door and bell staff, especially Sam, were all attentive and helpful. Taufique and Justin at the front desk were funny, friendly, and professional. They both made sure that a special request I had made to surprise my boyfriend was handled perfectly! The location of the hotel is perfect, walking distance to North Beach and Chinatown. And the recommendation for brunch at Cafe de La Presse was wonderful! Thank you for a memorable Valentine's Day weekend!"
110,2131,"Feb 10 2009 	Fantastic Hotel!!	Stayed at the Omni San Francisco in July / August 2008 after being in Berkeley for a few days. Since my girlfriend was on a conference in Berkeley, I travelled into San Francisco on BART one day and found my bearings and the Omni.We were planning on arriving before the advertised check-in time, so I thought I would inform the hotel and see if there was anything they could do for us?I was promptly informed that it would not be a problem and a note would be put on our booking giving us priority.When we actually made it to San Francisco we were greeted by a very friendly and courteous porter who took our bags and directed us to the check in desk. Check in was swift and as requested, our room was ready early.As the porter took us up in the lift he gave us some local information, this was much appreciated. Upon showing us the room, we were very impressed by the size and comfort. The room (standard) was quiet, serviced regularly (with evening turn-down) and very comfortable.Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with everything from local information to cinema listings and restaurant reservations (The Cheesecake Factory).Never ate breakfast or any meals at the hotel restaurant as we wanted to explore and try local cafes and restaurants.Location was not a problem (in the financial district - a bit away from main shopping area), as we quite enjoyed navigating the hills / tram cars / grid system and exploring the city as we went!Would definitely recommend as a top hotel in San Francisco - can't wait for next time!"
111,2131,"Feb 9 2009 	Excellent as Usual	This was the 3rd time we have stayed att his hotel and the service has been superb each time. My daughter, who is 8, loved the kid friendly attitude of the staff. The location cannot be beat because it is close enough to Union Square, Chinatown, and North Beach without being too far from Ferry Building and Market Street Malls. Also, it is very reasonably priced if you compare to other similar properties."
112,2131,"Feb 1 2009 	Omni San Francisco Hotel	Wife and I made our annual trip (actually, last visit was Dec.2007) to San Francisco, and our favorite hotel - The Omni. This is the fourth time in 4 years we've stayed here, and wouldn't stay anywhere else when visiting San Francisco. Stayed in a Signature room on the 16th floor, worth the extra cost. Staff is professional and willing to help in any way possible...from housekeeping to management. Financial district is a great, out of the way area to stay. Hotel bar looks out on the corner of California and Montgomery streets, and is a great place to enjoy a gargle or two with the wife, and people watch. Hotel's restaurant, Bob's, is a bit pricey, but the steaks are exceptional. Sublime luxury, but keep in mind that this is a luxury business-class hotel. so no swimming pool, or party people.....just the way I like it. Our stay is always a treat."
113,2131,"Jan 29 2009 	A very welcoming place	We had a wonderful 3 nights at the Omni. Perhaps what stands out most is the fact that the staff were always friendly and very professional. Kids are well looked after at this hotel - ours received Omni backpacks on arrival. They loved, among other things in the pack, the tweezers which make jelly beans glow. There is a kids menu available to order from on room service. A note about the french fries for kids: ask for un-seasoned fries if your kids don't like them flavoured with herbs. But the hotel itself was just right in every way - understatedly elegant, with clean, comfortable, spacious rooms and bathrooms. Street noise was not much of a problem, though police car sirens kept me awake one night. The Omni is in the financial district and there is not much buzz around the hotel. However, it is not a long walk to either the Union Square or Chinatown/North Beach areas. As to be expected in San Francisco, it is an uphill walk from Union Square to the Omni and an even steeper climb from the Omni to Chinatown. Trams stop just outside the hotel - these trams are good for those with a day pass (or longer), but individual trips can be expensive at about $5 per person per trip. Cabs are definitely the quickest and possibly cheapest way of getting around."
114,2131,"Jan 27 2009 	Perect place to stay on your honeymoon	We stayed in the Omni in late Ocotber'08 as part of our honeymoon and we can't speak highly enough of it. We arrived weary from our long trek from Ireland but once we got to the hotel the staff were lovely to us and they had upgraded us as we were honeymooners. We ordered room service shortly after checking in which arrived quickly and overall we found the staff could not have done enough for us. On our second night the hotel sent up a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely congratulaory card on our wedding. This was such a lovely gesture and another morning we were rushing for our alcatraz cruise so they organised a free lift for us to the pier. We loved every minute of our stay. Our room was fantastic so clean and comfortable, the staff were so lovely, the food so good that the Omni was the best possible place to start our honeymoon."
115,2131,"Jan 15 2009 	Best New Year Getaway!!	We stayed in the California Suite New Year's Eve and it was WonderFUL!! They were very kind and courteous. The staff was very attentive and helped made suggestions for dinner. Overall, it was the best new year ever!!! Thank you"
116,2131,"Jan 10 2009 	Typical Four-Star Hotel!!	My husband and I frequently travel to San Francisco and usually stay in different hotels of the same chain but in different parts of the city. This time we wanted to try another chain and based on so many rave reviews the Omni received booked there. Usually I agree with Trip Advisor's contributors for the most part but not this time. This is what you should expect and what you pay for in a four-star hotel. If you like &quot;old elegance&quot; this is the place for you. The location is great and the area around the hotel is very clean.We booked a sigature room based on the reservations agent description of it. It was not worth the extra money. It was on the sixteenth floor and overlooked Montgomery St but was so high you couldn't see the street, just old rooftops. There was no advantage in being so high up but the major disadvantage was the long waits for elevators.We found the staff to be very nice. Housekeeping was OK- skipped our room once so we didn't have our room done until after we left for the evening. Some days we recceived the number of towels we should have and other days we didn't. We received the fresh fruit and bottled water two of the four days. There were not many hotel guests while we were there. When I booked our room I inquired about the &quot;in-room&quot; safe size and was told my 15.4&quot; laptop would fit in it. This was not the case and everytime we went out we had to take it to the front desk to be locked in security and then wait again to retrieve it upon return - a major inconvenience. When we first discovered this upon checking in we spoke to the on-duty manager who said they were in the process of renovating the rooms and the renovated rooms will receive larger safes. He did not offer to move us to a renovated room nor compensate us with a complementary breakfast or the like for our inconvenience.The on-site restaurant is so over-priced it is comical. We had breakfast there twice and each time there was a major problem. We finally switched to room service - something we never do..After we got home I checked our credit card bill and found some odd charge. I called the hotel and it was a mini bar charge, which we didn't use. Although it was immediately removed it was it was just another hassle.All in all we had a great trip but the hotel was a disappointment."
117,2131,"Jan 8 2009 	Great Place to Stay in Heart of San Francisco	We stayed here for a weekend in San Francisco. When we were there (fall 2008), quite a bit of rennovation was still going on in the lobby area so things like the restaurant and lounge were not totally available. However, despite that we really enjoyed our stay here. It seemed to be more of a place for business people. During the weekend we barely saw another person, but once Sunday night rolled around, it was crowded. We had a renovated room, which was stylish and comfortable. We had no complaints at all. Our view from the window was not good, but this didn't bother us. We were there during an unusually warm time and I felt the air conditioner could have worked better. It wasn't bad or unacceptable, but it was really the only non-stellar part of the stay. Since it was in the upper 80s, I doubt this would very often be any kind of issue. One great thing about the room besides the typical hotel amenities was that it had plenty of outlets so we could easily charge all our various electronics. The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is totally convenient to the trolley cars and also some bus lines. We didn't have a car at all except our last day and had no issues getting around. This hotel does have somewhat high fees. The wifi was somewhat expensive (maybe $12) and the parking was very expensive ($20+ a day) so I would keep that in mind, but we would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone desiring a comfortable and stylish base for their San Francisco trip."
118,2131,"Jan 5 2009 	Amazing kid friendly hotel in SFO	I wanted to share our amazing experience of staying for 4 nights at the Omni in downtown SFO. We stayed at the Pottery Barn Suite and the kids absolutely loved it. A big King suite for the adults and a connecting kids suite all with bunk beds, plush toys, duckies in the bathroom, kids furniture, cookies, milk, cereal.... I can go on and on.Amazing service from the staff with great attention to detail - this was easily the best hotel we have stayed at in the USA. Truly a home away from home :-)."
119,2131,"Dec 31 2008 	Great place to stay!	We booked the Emerald Bowl package which was fantastic! This included two tickets to the CAL football game and a very nice room. The staff was warm and friendly. We especially want to recognize Carmen who went above her job to make sure we had our questions about the game answered. The hotel bar was very nice, great bartender and waitress, but they do need a happy hour! If one existed, we weren't aware of it. The hotel is near many bars, restaurants, and shopping. We had a great time and will be back!"
120,2131,"Dec 30 2008 	Omni - Great SF Hotel	Conveniently located within easy walking distance from North Beach, Chinatown, the Embacadero, museums, and great shopping, the Omni is a four star hotel with five star service. The lobby is all marble and highly polished gleam, and the friendly, accommodating staff insure a wonderful, pampered stay. From the doormen to the housekeepers, these hospitality pros understand the meaning of the concept of service. When I asked where I could buy a Chronicle newspaper nearby, one was delivered to my room. The concierge handled all the paperwork for my rental car arrangements, including delivery to the hotel at no extra cost. After a message was briefly delayed, I went to the desk to ask for an explanation of what I had done wrong with the phone in the room, and the desk staff immediately apologized for &quot;our mistake&quot;. There's no question that I was the one who made the mistake, but how refreshing to find employees who see their job as making me feel at ease. Service staff count on tips for a significant part of their income, but I never got the feeling that anyone had their hand out for money. Their hands were always reaching to assist me with a bag, or a door, or a taxi. The food is a cut above most hotel fare as well. I can't imagine staying anywhere else in San Francisco."
121,2131,"Dec 30 2008 	Best Vacation in Years	From the moment my cab pulled up and I was warmly greeted, I had the idea that this was going to be a very special vacation. Check-in was easy, no fuss, friendly, and efficient. Our room was spacious, welcoming, efficient, and warm, all at the same time. Because we were tired, we ordered dinner in the room. This and breakfast every day in our room were tasty, well-presented, and took very little time to arrive. The robes were warm, towels plentiful, and the shower comfortable for our romantic weekend. The bed was large, yet cozy, the comforter snuggly, and the mattress great for sore backs. Throughout the stay, the staff treated us warmly, and in a dignified manner. There were always little treats available in the lobby, including fruit, cookies, cider, and coffee. We plan to return whenever possible, and make it a Christmas tradition. The location is perfect for shopping and touring."
122,2131,"Dec 23 2008 	Loved the Omni...well it was pretty good anyway	I booked through a conference website for $160/night including tax. The location is good, near to Union Square, China Town and the Coit Tower and on a tram line. I was initially not impressed since everything seemed expensive (e.g. $6 bottle of water in the room - I used the tap). Also I didn't bother with breakfast at $20 for continental and $26 for cooked (perfectly good Chinese deli next door).You just need to join &quot;Select Guests&quot; and not only do you get free internet access (not Wi-fi yet though) but you are also treated to a free 2 morning drinks (e.g. posh tea and grapefruit juice) and a &quot;turndown&quot; service (which I'd never heard of): you come home to find relaxing music on and ice in the wine cooler and a chocolate mint!Any problems I had were dealt with well (free internet help line) and overall a positive experience. I don't usually like these rather souless posh city hotels, but this was pretty good after early reservations."
123,2131,Dec 18 2008 	Nice hotel in a good location!	This is nice hotel in a good location. Reasonably priced within financial district and short walk to Chinatown. Short distance to public transportation and cab rides are a short distance to tourist attraction. Rooms are clean and staff is friendly.
124,2131,"Dec 12 2008 	Lovely staff	We are a little late with this review, we stayed during September 2008 We travel quite a lot for leisure and always try to find good value, we dont expect quality to be compromised by the price, and this hotel did not fail in any way. We would have no hesitation is returning to this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.We felt this hotel was quite special; we booked directly with the hotel and got a special rate.The hotel in a good location in the financial area, the cable cars pass the front door but it is only a short walk to most things.From the moment we pulled up at the front door we were made to feel welcome.The person on the door was friendly and helpful, looked after our luggage and introduced us to reception staff. In general we found all the door staff to be really nice. (Every time we entered or left the hotel there was a warm welcome,) Some hotels can be impersonal and cold, the Omni, however, was friendly and welcoming and although this was a reasonably large hotel we almost made to feel part of the family. Reception staff were lovely, as were all the staff throughout the hotel.The lady that serviced our room was cheerful, friendly, and professional in every way,The rooms were of a good size and were clean and tidy and well maintained, the bed was very comfortable, we had fantastic nights sleep, the rooms air conditioning was good and there were plenty of fluffy towels. The water in the bathroom was piping hot and the shower had plenty of pressure.All in all there are no complaints about this hotel but for us the staff made it an extra special place. We really want to thank for staff for their great work that made us feel so at home."
125,2131,Dec 8 2008 	Fantastic Hotel in SF	Very friendly and knowledgeable staff (from the operator for directions to the bell staff for restaurant recommendations). Room was spacious and beds were incredibly comfortable. Flat screen TVs were a nice luxury. Valet parking was incredibly quick. Lobby entrance was filled with dramatic Christmas decorations by the end of our stay. Will definitely be back.
126,2131,"Dec 7 2008 	Best hotel ever!	We stayed here for 3 nights in an upgraded room, and it was heavenly! The bed.. oh my god.. I would love to have one at home, everything was perfect. The friendliness at the reception, the bell boy, door man, the bar... I cannot compliment them enough. We got some excellent dining tips from the lady at the hotel bar, and had one of the best meals I ever had in my life!I forgot my lap top in a taxi, and everyone helped me to get it back. The door man even lent us his mobile phone and sent ut to the bar while we waited for the taxi company to call us back. And, I got the lap top back, how lucky wasn't I???Thank you so much for the best nights I ever had in a hotel, and I travel alot."
127,2131,Dec 2 2008 	The Omni is beautiful with great accomidations.	I would say the front desk staff was very helpful getting us there over the phone. Check-in and check-out was very smooth. Overall they were very helpful and accomidating. Valet was great and they were very prompt both taking and bringing our car.We stayed in a really nicely furnished Suite. The internet was fast and had no problems the entire stay. Two flat screen tvs and a very nice compact stereo. The Room was spotless and the house keeping staff did a great job keeping the room up and helping us with special requests.I will definitly stay at this property again. My compliments to the Management and staff.
128,2131,"Dec 2 2008 	Above 	My partner and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco for 8 nights. I knew about this hotel from when I lived in San Francisco and worked in the Financial District. We booked an entire vacation on Hotwire and paid a little more to stay at the Omni only because I'd always wanted to stay there. Little did I know what an experience we were in for.We checked in on Saturday night. Crystal at the front desk immediately upgraded us to a concierge floor room. She was genuinely friendly, professional and outgoing. Check-in was quick and easy.The room was elegantly furnished. The only drawback was that it seemed small. We were there for eight nights and we found that it lacked storage for all of our clothes. I think for a shorter stay, the room would've been absolutely perfect. From the bellman to the front desk attendants to the valets to the doormen to the room service people, the service was nothing less than spectacular. Everyone remembered our names, what room we were in, had our car waiting for us in a timely manner. We had breakfast at Bob's Steak House one morning. The french toast is to die for and the portions are big. Though the food seemed expensive, the portion size made up for the price. The room was appointed with a plasma TV, king size bed with down comforter. We had turn down service nightly with water and fresh fruit waiting for us when we returned from the day out. We had drinks of our choice and newpapers waiting at our door every morning. The hotel was originally a bank that was gutted and rebuilt in early 2000's. It was beautiful on the inside and out. It didn't seem overcrowded at all. As a matter of fact, it seemed nearly empty most of the time we were there. It is located on California Street @ Montgomery, on the California Street Cable Car Line and in the heart of the Financial District. I liked this location because it was out of the way of all of the tourist traps and it was nice to come home at night to a quiet, much more relaxed environment. Though we are planning to move back to San Francisco in the coming year, I do believe that I will stay at the Omni again before we move and I will definitely, definitely suggest it to anyone coming for a visit."

130,2131,"Nov 14 2008	I LOVE THE OMNI	We stayed at the Omni over Labor Day weekend for 3 nights...I had stayed at this hotel before the year before in December, and fell in love with it... From the fresh fruit and refreshing lemonade in the lobby to the nightly chocolate on my pillow. Its all about the details for me and customer service.The Omni delivers. I love the fresh flowers in the lobby,the warm greeting from all staff members, the housekeeper's friendly notes, the rooms...I can go on and on...But I really love where The Omni SF is located. The financial district is bustling during the week, but on the weekends its quiet. The hotel is walking distance from the Ferry Building,Chinatown, and Nob Hill. You could even walk to Union Square. When we went in September, we spent a day in Napa Valley.The concierge helped us book a rental car for delivery at the hotel the next morning.However, when we went to the lobby the car wasnt there.Because it was Labor Day weekend, the rental car company was slammed.We understood and went to go pick up the car.To make a long story short, we ended up waiting 2hours in line, and it ruined the whole day for us.Although it wasnt The Omni's fault, when we returned that night, I informed the concierge and he took care of the valet.Upon returning home, I received the Omni Hotel survey,and let them know about the mishap.I promptly received a response from the hotel's general manager Carmen Serra and she apologized for the inconvenience the rental car company caused us,and refunded the rental car fee back to our credit cars.She also helped me book another stay at the Omni in San Diego for next weekend.I was very satisfied with how she handled the situation...just another reason why I love the Omni! No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but I appreciated their efforts to resolve the issue."
131,2131,"Nov 11 2008 	Great Hotel	After a very poor experience at another SanFran Hotel it was a pleasure to check into the Omni.Great hotel and great staff. Service was impeccable throughout and that is the hotels strength. Genuinely warm and helpful staff make a big difference.It could do with decorating I think as its a bit dated now. Its not worn or anything, just could do with bringing up to date. Excellent location, excellent rooms. Bobs Chop House downstairs is great and Town car to airport a blessing."
132,2131,"Nov 9 2008 	Good experience	We stayed at The Omni in San Francisco for 3 nights while we went on a wine tour in Sedona. The service was good, the rooms were fine, and it was an overall good experience. I have stayed in nicer hotels, but this was in a good location to sight seeing and shopping. The rooms were quiet and the beds were confortable enough. We did, however eat at the restaurnant downstairs for dinner and breakfast and had some issues. The food was good, but the service was not. Waiters were slightly rude and one night at dinner we had to go find the hostess to be seated. We stood there for over 15 minutes. Across the street there is a stop for the trolley and the bellman was good about helping us hail taxis. One night they even had the hotel car take us to the pier for our alcatraz tour. Overall we had a good experience at this hotel and would recommend it to others."
133,2131,"Nov 4 2008 	Loved the Omni - so friendly!	Had a great stay at the Omni. Everyone was so friendly and remembered our names:o) Check in was a breeze.Lovely, spotless hotel room. 2 nice beds and nice size bathroom. Greeted with a bottle of champagne and strawberries dipped in chocolate as it was a birthday celebration - great touch!Housekeeping were never seen but left the room clean and tidy every day and left chocolates by the bed in the evening with the TV on a chill channel.Lex and the staff were always on hand for information, directions / hints and tips.Debora was also a star performer.Darryl the doorman was great - always took an interest in what we were doing and where we had been. Made suggestions of places to go to and places to avoid. Always very friendly and made us feel special. It made the hotel a welcome sight after being out all day.The hotel was in a great location - close to everything, walk to Union Square, Ferry Building, we walked to Pier 39 and Ghiradelli Square, cable cars run past the front door etc. I wasn't too keen on the Pier 39 location - good to visit and see the sealions and found there were a lot of homeless people around Union Square area so this suited us just fine.Can't comment on the food in the hotel as we never ate there. Noah's do a great bagel in the morning - just along from the cable car turnaround.If I return to San Francisco - I'd stay here again like a flash!"
134,2131,"Nov 2 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed 3 nights on last leg of our honeymoon from Hawaii. Hotel was clean, comforatable, central location &amp; 24 hr room service. All staff are very friendly...from the front desk to housekeeping leaving personal thank you notes from the tip we left in the room for her. Lex, the concierge is very knowledgable and helpful. They even gave us a late check out to 5pm no charge because we had a late flight. Its not a huge hotel with all the ammenities such as pool/spa, but its everything we needed. Bob's steak house which is attached to the hotel was very good...expensive, but good. We dined at both the restaurant as well as the bar. I signed up on Omni's website to be a member...well worth it...we received free coffee, juice, and newspaper every morning. Cable car is out front of the hotel and easy to get anywhere from this location. We would definetly stay here again."
135,2131,"Oct 31 2008 	Omni Great Hotel!	Stayed at the Omni from October 24th to October 29th. We arrived very late on the 24th and were thrilled at the quick and easy way the whole check-in process was handled. Everyone we came in contact with were very happy and willing to help you in any way they could. Need to make a reservation for dinner, day trip, tour? All you had to do was ask the people at the front desk and they were very happy to provide all the information you might want and and make the arrangements for you. Had a partial bay view room, very nice size, perfect size bathroom didn't have any complaints about that at all. The hotel is in walking distance to the ferries that will take you over to Sausalito. Union Square, and Chinatown are within walking distance too. If you needed to catch a cab all you had to do was ask one of the doormen and you had one in a flash. There are always town cars out front too if you prefer a little more plush ride somewhere, not much more expensive than a cab and a lot nicer. I have to say I don't know what anyone would have to complain about when staying at this hotel. Would certainly stay here again!"
136,2131,Oct 15 2008 	Perfect	Very nice hotel with all the amenities. Staff is excellent.
137,2131,"Oct 15 2008	Great Place to stay	Stayed here in Sept for 2 nights location, rooms and the staff where all excellant."
138,2131,"Oct 15 2008	Love this place!	This place has quickly become my hotel of choice in San Francisco. It's a wonderful location, and the staff is exceptional, top to bottom. From the start of your stay and your dealings with the front desk, through check-out and having the door man hail a cab, all in all you're treated with great care and attention to detail. Highly recommended!"
139,2131,Oct 13 2008 	A touch of class in everything	Top class hotel with excellent location. Elegance and personal touch make this hotel the best choice in San Francisco
140,2131,"Oct 13 2008 	OMG!!!! It was just perfect	Service, service, service!!! It was phenomenal. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. It was so very nice to be treated to such wonderful service. Another wonderful recommendation from previous Trip Advisor guests and one that I will highly recommend to others. We were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary and when we got to the hotel, our room had been upgraded and I was handed a long stem red rose. Later on that night we received complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries that were left in our room.The concierge new perfect spots for us to try in our afternoon travel on foot. We were close enough to walk down to the warf and enjoy the open air market Tons to see and do we enjoyed every minute!"
141,2131,"Oct 5 2008 	Pleasant Stay	The Omni was where we stayed for the first few nights of our honeymoon and it was lovely- but it wasn't take your breath away stuff.The lobby is beautiful, with free starbucks coffee in the morning and the concierge is very helpful.The rooms- i think we had a deluxe- are nice but a bit dated in style and small. The bathrobes they give you are amazing however.They gave us chocolate dipped strawberries and champagne to greet us which was nice.The location is good aswell, particularly if you like chinese food and want to be near china town.I couldn't really fault the Omni- but as you can probably tell from the tone of my review- i'm not overly excited about it either!"
142,2131,"Oct 4 2008 	My New Favorite Hotel in SF	We stayed here for two nights (9/27 &amp; 9/28) and had a most wonderful hotel experience. The rooms are on the small-ish side but the service and housekeeping were stellar! The front desk and concierge also went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. We arrived at noon, earlier than the 3pm check-in time, and the front desk found us an available room so we could check in right away. All our housekeeping concerns (requests for extra towels, pillows etc.)were addressed almost immediately. Would love to stay here again!More photos at my blog: virgbee.blogspot.com"
143,2131,"Oct 4 2008 	Absolutely Fine - but not didn't set the world on fire	Lovely hotel that is period USA - well situated in downtown San Fran, all staff without exception were excellent and very helpful. Gym facilities good and clean.The hotel has 1 bar which is more like a small TV longe and a steak resturant that is like a traditional old style steak house. Meat was of an excellent quality and cut but the Chef did a weird thing with a 8 inch whole carrot that was stuck in the middle of the plate........???? Really not sure what was going on there !This place is absolutely fine and ideal for down town shopping location, im quite suprised it makes the top 6 in the trailfinders list but hey ho !"
144,2131,"Oct 4 2008 	More like Oh my	Booked Omni on Trip Advisor recommendation during busy/expensive period in San Fran. Yes, clean, quiet,comfortable,convenient for Union Square. But bland. Creepy handwritten messages from Faye in housekeeping everyday, assumed angling for tip but maybe management think this is being welcoming? Concierge helpful but a bit like a robot on speed (no doubt having to say the same things day in and out)Strange check in lady did not listen that we wanted to split the bill ; intolerable male check out desk guy lectured us when we complained that Omni had deducted whole amount from my card BEFORE we had checked out. Told us that in 30yrs of the hospitality industry he had never heard of guests paying when checking out. Funny that, the 4 Seasons in Vegas we stayed at afterwards, had no problem! (nor the many hotels we stay in internationally)We stayed in the Orchard a few days later; definitely prefer for service."
145,2131,"Oct 3 2008 	Omni is very nice....	We spent 10 nights at the Omni in September and had a fantastic time. The hotel is convenietly located in the Financial district within walking distance of Union Square, Fishermans Warf etc. Our room on the 5th floor did not have a great view but was very quiet and well worth sacrificing the view for. The rooms are in excellent condition, and the maid service is first class. The staff are very helpul and courteous at all times, ensuring our stay went without a hitch. The only small complaint we have is that the one and only bar in the hotel (Bobs bar) is very small and gets very crowded from approx 5pm onwards, and getting a seat was almost impossible around those times. However it is no reason not to stay here. When we first arrived after our lengthy journey from Scotland, we were informed that our room (booked and paid for 8 months previousley) had been cancelled by Octopus travel who we had booked the room through. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful in rectifying the situation.San Francisco is well worth a visit and has plenty to offer for all. We would recommend visiting Alcatraz and taking the coach tour of the city, however book your Alcatraz tickets online as far in advance as possible to ensure you get the dates you require. We also hired bikes from Blazing Saddles and rode over the Golden Gate bridge to Tiburon via Sausilto. This is a fantastic way to see the bridge and surrounding area (weather allowing). Sausilto is a must see when you are there and can be accessed by Ferry if you prefer not to bike it, dining is recommeded at Angelino's while you are there. We also took a wine tour to Napa valley etc and would recommend this trip, with plenty of samples included in the day ensuring the hoilday spirit was flowing. Union square is packed with all the usual big name shops, but visit the hippy district at upper Haight street for some of the funkiest shops available. We visited the zoo but found it to be dated and shabby with many of the animals not available to view. Of course you must take a ride on a tram while you are there, we would advise getting a day pass for 11 bucks, which allows you to hop on and off all day at your leisure. Finally Lombard St aka the most crookidest street in the world is worth a look with camera in hand.We had 2 days of cloud followed by 8 days of glorious sunshine while we we there.Book it up, you will enjoy!!!!"
146,2131,"Oct 2 2008 	Excellent hotel Great location Good Value!	Based on reviews about this hotel, we decided to stay here the weekend of October 3rd to attend a wedding in the city. We were just as pleased with the hotel as the recent reviews and high ranking indicate.The Front Desk and Concierge were very pleasant and always willing to assist with questions. We had a great room with a very nice city view. Housekeeping was very detailed and the room was impeccably clean. I thought a very nice touch/detail was a personalized handwritten note from our housekeeper welcoming us. You dont see that too often.We did room service on Friday night and ordered off of the Bob's Steakhouse menu, which is the hotel's restaurant in the lobby. The food was awesome! The filet was so tender and by far the best baked potatoe and candied carrot I have ever had! The delivery was right on time, the food was hot and the server was very friendly. I travel alot for business and I find Room Service to be very poor even in the best hotels. Not here. They did a great job!They gym at this hotel is very nice with great cardio and weight machines. Little details like complimentary bottled water and a huge basket of fresh fruit are not forgotten.The location was very convenient and the price we paid was a bargain for the value and in comparison to most of the other hotels in the area since we shopped around before making our reservation. I highly recommned this hotel!"
147,2131,"Oct 1 2008 	Omni Very Nice Hotel	We stayed at the Omni for 3 nights at the end of our Alaskan cruise. First impressions were great door men and bell boys and reception very helpful check in was quick and easy, and although we arrived early our room was ready.The lobby is very grand with a classy feel, we ate in the restaurant once for breakfast which was nicely presented although where service is concerned they seemed to focus more time on the business people than the people on vacation we didn't get as much attention as the business people.Our room was nice although we had a few problems phone would not stop beeping and was very loud and annoying,safe was broken and so was the plug in the sink. We reported these faults to the front desk straight away and these faults were dealt with immediatey. When I expressed my disspointment with the faults in our room Richard on the front desk was very apologetic but was unable to move us as the hotel was full due to the Oracle convention being in town but that he would report our concerns to his manager. That evening when we got back to our room there was a letter of apology and a free breakfast voucher which was a nice touch. Our room was spacious with a large flat screen t.v and large comfortable bed the bathroom was again very spacious and very clean.Its the small touches in this hotel that make your stay memorable the turn down service is exellent along with the usual chocolates ou also get a small card informing you what the weather will be like the following day. The location of the Omni is o.k in the financial district so not much around in the 1st few blocks but Union square in only a 15/20 min walk away but a taxi is necessary to Fishrmans Wharf which will cost just under $10.Despite the faults in our room on arrival the Omni is a very classy hotel and would definitely return to this hotel."
148,2131,Oct 1 2008	Brilliant Hotel	Just back - hotel was marvellous. Every member of staff went out of their way to help you. Great location too.
149,2131,"Sep 25 2008 	Omni San Fran - Great Hotel	We stayed at the Omni for 4 nights at the tail-end of our honeymoon - it was perfectly suitable. I great base for tourists. Convenient for the cable car, bus, China Town, North Beach etc. Felt safe walking around at night. The room was delightful - clean and tastefully decorated, falt screen TV, light and airy feel. Nice big bathroom. Robs Steak House was quite nice, although a bit pricey. They did give us free dessert when we mentioned we were on honeymoon, which was a nice touch.Receptionists were generally very helpful, as were the doormen."
150,2131,"Sep 21 2008 	Great hotel for a vacation	Good location - is on a cable car run, is near the business district which I felt it is a safe area and is also walkable to say Union Square for breakfast. The service is great - Joey Nubla made reservations at restaurants and was always pleasant and helpful. Cabs were hailed on my behalf etc. by the doormen. The rooms are large, and clean - beds are turned down each evening with a chocolate left, and TV set to a &quot;chill out&quot; channel. Bathrooms are good and clean, with a great shower and plenty of clean towels. Only thing missing are complimentary slippers - a small point! I was out before breakfast started on tourist trips but coffee is available in take out cups at reception which is just perfect.Would definitely recommend to business and holiday travellers alike, and if I were to return would definitely stay here!"
151,2131,"Sep 16 2008 	Another Awesome Stay	It is no wonder that this hotel won the Best Hotel for Service and the Best Luxury Hotel in 2008! I stayed here a few times before and travel to SFO frequently. This hotel is CONSISTENTLY GREAT in both service, cleanliness and dining/room service. The Front Desk and Concierge are very knowledgeable and friendly. You cannot stand in the lobby without them greeting you and sincerely wanting to assist. They recommended some wonderful restaurants. BTW, the hotels restaurant, Bob's Steakhouse, is awesome in intself. One of the best steaks I ever had. My wife had the salmon which was equally as good.I was there on business during the week and extended my stay for the weekend so my wife could meet me. I upgraded to a lovely two room King bedded corner suite. The room was clean, the housekeeping staff is very efficient and eager to please by leaving extra coffee and cream after I asked her for it on my first morning. A great marble bath with wonderful amenities too.The location of the hotel is central to all and the cable car runs right in front of the hotel. A very nice size gym too that I used each day.I will continue to stay at the Omni for both business and pleasure. You cannot beat the hotel and it is an awesome value given the service, location and rooms."
152,2131,Sep 15 2008	Great Service and accomadtions	At the time of our arrival we were greeted by a very friendly doorman. After a very pleasent check in we were taken to our room by the bellman. He infromed us of all the services avavilable at the hotel.We had a wonderful dinner at the hotel's restaurant followed by after dinner drinks in the lounge.Next time we come to San Francisco we will stay at the Omni again.
153,2131,Sep 15 2008	Billing issue	We had a pretty good stay. They staff was nice and efficient. The location was good for us. It seem a bit expensive. When I got come I found they charged us twice for a room (on a different credit card that we used to authorize the room). I called and they fixed the probblem but it was an upsetting inconvenience and lowered my perception of the chain. It was my first time at an Omni. If they'd offered to comp us a night or something I probably would have given them five stars.The bigger concern is that they could not find the record of making the incorrect charge. I had to have my bank confirm it for them. This makes me worry overall about thier IT infrastructure abiity to charge guest accurately.
154,2131,"Sep 14 2008 	Efficient but not great value	We stayed at this hotel at the end of a trip travelling around California. When we started our trip we stayed at the excellent Donatello, but unfortunately they had no rooms available when we returned to the city. The Omni was expensive and although it did everything it is meant to do it did it without any soul. We booked through Priceline a room with two double beds. On arrival Reception said that as this was booked through a third party it could not be guaranteed and so we had to have a bed made up for our daughter. I have no criticisms of the room, apart perhaps that everything being a bit too frilly - not really our style. I was irritated to have to pay $10 for access to the hotel wifi - why do the cheaper hotels and motels provide this free and the more expensive hotels charge for this?The breakfast was over formal and as their is no buffet we ordered dishes that were OK, but extremely over priced. The staff were efficient and the doorman friendly, but I would not stay at this hotel again."
155,2131,"Sep 11 2008 	Wedding Wonderland	We were very pickey about where we would stay for our wedding celebration. The Omni exceed all expectations. The front desk was fabulous--all concierge staff which is very smart. But, one person was extra special--Lex. He even met us at city hall as we were going in to be married to give us a very touching, hand-written note honoring our momentous occasion. Yes, he was off the clock, on his own time. While the entire facility was wonderful, including the upgrade to a suite, excellent room service, picnic lunch for the limo, contact for flower bouquet, etc.,--it is the PEOPLE that make this hotel truly special. We are already making plans to return for our first anniversary!"
156,2131,"Sep 10 2008 	Great hotel great location great staff!	Beautiful lobby - I was a little concerned when we arrived because I had booked a discounted rate through an online booking site and thought we might get an inferior room - but to my delight, we got a great room. The concierge was awsome, with details about restaurants (reasonably priced too!) and a great place for a drink with a view across the street. We were there on a Saturday when the hotel arranges a free 2 hr.morning walk with local historians. (different people each week) The hotel is located on the California cable car route (the front desk can sell you 1,3 or 5 day passes which cover all public transit and are a great value). Don't miss the cable car museum - free and really interesting - for kids from 1 to 100! Don't go for breakfast at the hotel - unless you want to pay $25 for bacon and eggs and don't drink the bottled water in the room - it had a price tag of $6.99 on it! Go to the fitness room where you can pick up a small bottle for free that fits nicely into your handbag! Also they have fresh fruit in the lobby - and if not there, then in the fitness room again! We would definitely recommend this hotel."
157,2131,"Sep 8 2008 	just wonderful -- cannot recommend highly enough	Our experience at this hotel has been great.We arrived around 11 am on a Saturday and were able to check in early. The room was large and clean. (We had two double beds, a table, a large dresser with a flat screen TV inside), a comfortable bathroom with really high ceilings. In the evening, the room was turned down with chocolates placed next to the bed, together with a personal note from housekeeping. We are Select Guest members, so we got free breakfast drinks and newspaper delivered to the room. Everyone we encountered has been nothing but pleasant, helpful, and accommodating. The hotel has fresh fruit and very tasty lemonade in the lobby in the afternoon. One of the nights, when my fiance and I were coming in, the concierge presented me with a beautiful red rose (my fiance did not order one, this is just a completely random, nice gesture -- many thanks to Omni for that!). The lobby is good size and beautifully furnished. The location is convenient. We had a great time and are sad to be leaving tomorrow morning."
158,2131,"Sep 6 2008 	Formal corporate america	Don't get us wrong for an okay hotel experience (desk staff and porters really good) but it was an impersonal space with no coffee making facilities in the room and a charge of $1.98 if you drank the bottle of mineral water (one third of a liter) that was available, you were also charged if you had the temerity to use the starch that was perched above the ironing board....for a large hotel chain pretty shoddy practice....If you don't mind being in with corporate USA (terrible fashion sense!) this is the place for you. If on the other hand you want a funky experience look elsewhere.....very disappointed.For the price it does not represent good value for money."
159,2131,"Sep 5 2008 	Beauitful Hotel	This hotel was absolutly beauitful! We stayed here over the 4th of July weekend and had a great time. The hotel is in a great location, we were able to walk everywhere only having to take a cab once or twice. The service was phenominal, and I loved how room service happened in the afternoon instead of the early morning hours. The only down side was that when we needed to print out our tickets for a cruise they charged an insane amount of money to log onto the internet and use their printer (I believe it was $10 for just a few minutes and one sheet of paper!). All in all we would definatly stay here again!"
160,2131,"Sep 3 2008 	Don't stay here	This hotel does not deserve to be voted number 1 hotel in san francisco. I stayed in 2 hotels in san francisco and this one was much the poorer of the 2, the other hotel was the intercontental. This was also twice the price of the intercontenental, and i booked on the recomendation of tripadvisor. (a mistake!!!!!!!) The room was on the fifth floor facing a very busy road and was very noisy. The room was small and shabby. the toilet flooded the first night. The dinner in the restaurant was overpriced and over cooked. Not a hotel to return to."
161,2131,"Aug 31 2008 	Great hotel great service	I stayed at the San Francisco Omni twice during my 11 day trip to N. California. I have never stayed at an Omni, even though I travel 5-7 times a year. I loved this hotel, specifically because of its superb service. When traveling for pleasure I prefer B&amp;B because of the hospitality, local flavor, attention to service. I have to say that the folks at this Omni treated me and my wife as if we were at their home. We were always graciously greeted by the doorman, front desk, and concierge....they actually remembered us. It is such a surprise to get this level of attention in such a big city, in the heart of the financial district.The rooms were very, very clean. As I was there twice during my trip I was able to compare 2 different room types. Both times, the rooms were impeccably clean. All of the amenities you would expect for a business hotel are available. The hotel is located very close to the Ferry building and Chinatown. Being located in the financial district makes the hotel close to San Francisco's excellent restaurants including, Aqua and Perbacco. We ate at Perbacco and would recommend to anyone.We used the concierge services extensively and they were always courteous, quick, and thorough. It just wasn't the concierge that helped us. Everyone in the hotel goes out of their way to help. The lady that checked-us in, Crystal, was superb!!!They made a number of reservations for us and provided excellent recommendations.It's not close to the touristy areas near Fisherman's Wharf, but I wasn't looking to be in the heart of a tourist haven. If you are looking for a great hotel, with excellent service that makes you feel like you are at home this is the place to be. I will definitely be coming back to this hotel."
162,2131,"Aug 30 2008	What makes this hotel so great is the staff amenities and location	Our family stayed at the Omni for a week during a vacation to San Francisco in August 2008. The Omni is very well managed and their staff top notch. The concierge, the front desk staff, housekeeping, security and Darryl (the Omni's very cool doorman who helped us secure transportation from the Outer Lands concert at Golden Gate Park to avoid the crowds) are pleasant, responsive and knowledgeable.We had a wonderful time in San Francisco and the folks at the Omni played a huge role in making it so pleasant."
163,2131,"Aug 29 2008	Outstanding in every way!	We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Omni. It was wonderful in every way. We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary, a &quot;big&quot; birthday, and our daughter's graduation from law school. Our room was upgraded to a beautiful suite and immediately after checking we were presented with a bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and roses! The hotel itself is lovely. Old world European look in the lobby, but very comfortable and updated rooms with modern amenities. Perfect location at the edge of the financial district (not overrun with tourists) but close to Chinatown and Union Square. The cable car is right outside the front door. But the best part of the experience at this hotel was the people!Everyone at the front desk was so helpful ( they even greeted me the next morning by my name); the Concierge Lex was an encyclopedia of information about special places to eat, visit etc and would sprinkle his recommendations with personal anecdotes; the bellman Ramon would often strike up a conversation and always ask about our day. This is a special hotel and made our celebration even more special."
164,2131,"Aug 27 2008 	Overpriced fare for standard experience	Our flight was canceled and we couldn't get out until a day later, and the Omni was very nice about canceling the missed night without a fuss; we did have to shell out $50 for valet parking each night, which is a bit excessive, and our room, while large and comfortable, had a close-up view of the windows of the business offices next door. The staff was extremely courteous, but in a way that made us feel that they were fishing for tips - not warm, just perfunctory - fake smiles all the way. All in all, it seemed very much like a business hotel, not a 4 star luxury hotel."
165,2131,"Aug 26 2008 	Great hotel in a great location	We stayed at the Omni in July this year. It was our first trip to San Francisco, so we weren't sure of which area to stay in, but the Omni turned out to be perfectly located for us. It's in the Financial District, so it's quiet at night, but we felt perfectly safe walking there after dark. It's also on the cable-car line, within easy walking distance of Chinatown and the Ferry Building and if you don't mind walking a bit further, you can easily walk to the Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas from here. The hotel itself is lovely and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. If I had to pick one thing to fault the room on, it would be the fixed-head shower. I didn't have a particular problem with it, but it was just ok - investing a little money in the shower would really bring it up to the standard of the rest of the accommodation. Staff at the Omni were very friendly and helpful, from check-in, where they offered to help us book any attractions we wanted to see, room service bending over backwards to make us happy when there was a slight problem with our order, the concierge recommending places to eat, right through to the doorman offering us the hotel car when we were leaving for the airport (at only $5 more than the taxi fare, this was a nice option). In addition, when we had an issue with the guests in the adjoining room holding an impromptu party late one night, hotel security dealt with it very quickly.We joined the Select Guest program online for free and this entitled us to complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juice every morning, as well as complimentary WiFi access and a daily newspaper. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant, which was somewhat expensive, but excellent quality and really tasty. There was complimentary fresh fruit (peaches, apricots, plums etc, not just standard apples) and juice or iced tea in the lobby every afternoon, which was nice when returning from sightseeing before going out to dinner. And the gym provided complimentary bottled water and apples and bananas too.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely return if we are ever in San Francisco again!"
166,2131,"Aug 25 2008 	Nice but not a wow	This is the second time I have stayed at the Omni, both on business. The Omni is a nice 4 star hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are of average size, but quite adequate. The furnishings are in good condition except for the carpet which is very tired and in need of replacing. The worn state of the carpet really detracts from the rest of the room. The internet connection, although it uses a wire, was fast and reliable ($10/day). The staff was very friendly and helpful. For example, they set up transportation for me on multiple days without a hitch. The hotel food is only average in quality, but very expensive. The hotel is located not far from anything, but not close to anything either; a geographical compromise. I timed the walk to Union Square at 15 minutes via Montgomery, hang a right at Post (note this way is flat, no hills). San Francisco hotels are very expensive for what you get. The Omni is better than both nearby Hyatts. I would stay there again, but will likely try another hotel on my next visit."
167,2131,"Aug 24 2008 	The best hotel anywhere	I just returned from a wonderful 4 day in San Francisco, and 3 nights at the Omni Hotel San Francisco was a treat. I aways stay there now, and the accommodations, amenities, and staff are the best of any hotel I know. it is well-located and to me it is paradise away from home in America's favorite city.Martin I. Laichtman, M.D."
168,2131,"Aug 21 2008 	Living Large In San Francisco!	Giving this hotel 5 stars is easy with the type of service they deliver! I am a believer!I pulled up after a night at the newly finished J.W. Marriott hotel in Union Square, bad planning on my part. I was denied late check out and feeling a little green; I thought I would take my chances on an early check-in at the Omni. Having booked through Travelocity, my hopes were not high. I was greeted by the extremely efficient and professional Evelyn. She was kind, sympathetic and sincere. I was not a lesser human being for booking a discount room from an online service, hurray! I was feeling better. Evelyn clicked away on her keyboard and had me in a room within 10 minutes, my day was turning around. Enter Fernando, the very pleasant and chatty bellman that seemed to know everyone. He whisked my luggage away and we had a nice conversation. I arrived in the simple, yet elegant room to find a handwritten note from the housekeeper, Suyuak. I am a sucker for the personal touch. Slipping into a comfortable robe provided by the hotel, I decided to order room service, a Kobe burger would surely bring me around. The burger arrived and it was delicious! The meat was lightly spiced with a hint of pepper and the melted cheddar was just right! The fries were lightly spiced and delicious too. My high school reunion was 5 hours away and I was starting to feel human again. After a nice nap on the comfortable bed it was time to shower and head out for the evening. At the end of a long night, I decided to have a couple of classmates over to continue the reminiscing. I called over from the Sir Francis Drake where the reunion took place and asked room service to send a cart of refreshments up to my room. 30 minutes later when we all arrived, a beautiful cart with stemware, refreshments and snacks was waiting for us. Two thumbs up for Ms. Joanne, the goddess of In Room Dining that was running the floor solo and made this all happen. Mind you it was the manager the next day that told me Ms. Joanne had been alone, Ms. Joanne never complained or muttered a word. She made it all seem effortless. When it was time to turn in, I was so happy to have a minty treat on my pillow and turn down service. Most hotels in the four star genre have done away with this simple pleasure, it was a real treat to see my sheets folded down.When I walked up to the counter to check out the following day, I couldn't wait to shower the staff with praise. Crystal was checking me out and before she had the chance to ask, I blurted out &quot;I love this hotel!&quot; Crystal proceeded to check me out with the utmost efficiency and showered my with savings passes for Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and Macy's. What a smart move! Now I have to go back and book a room for a shopping weekend! All around the staff were magnificent, the hotel was well maintained and aesthetically pleasing, and I left in a really good mood!In the future I will book directly through the hotel and pay the higher price. I don't want to risk ending up at another hotel!"
169,2131,"Aug 20 2008 	Hit or Miss hotel	The Omni hotel is nice enough, and tries to offer decent service. But the rooms are definitely hit or miss and it is quite random whether you will get a nice accommodation. On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located downtown in the financial district. A bit far from the convention center or tourist destinations but great if you are in town for work. The staff is generally professional and helpful.The lobby is a bit small and it can be difficult to get past all the doormen to get to the desk. Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past.Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a &quot;premium&quot; room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size.Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def&quot; TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn.Premium rooms offer &quot;a courtyard view&quot;. Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual &quot;view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer.If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek.The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about.All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel. But when reservations are scarce you are better off at a more reliable property."
170,2131,"Aug 18 2008 	wonderful omni	We had the pleasure of 3 nights at The Omni with our family of 4 including 2 teenage girls one of whom uses a wheelchair. The staff at the Omni could not have been more helpful and friendly and although there were not many families that we could see staying I highly recommend this place to families looking for an up market experience. Milk and cookies were delivered every night for our girls and every time we passed through the lobby they returned with red roses, a toy cable car, chocolates, postcards, an unused cable car pass left by a previous guest, and best of all a big smile. The service was quite simply fantastic and very personal. I must give a special mention to Lex the conciege who was great and even helped us when he saw us looking at the map when he was off duty and we were shopping.I would recommend this hotel to anyone - it won't disappoint. The location was quiet and yet within reasonable, relatively flat walking distance of everything we needed."
171,2131,Aug 15 2008 	Terrific Stay	My family of six recently spent two wonderful nights at the Omni San Francisco. The Omni was our last stop on a two week long family vacation. We enjoyed our stay immensely. We loved the location as well as the terrific service we received at the Omni. At first I regretted my decision not to stay in the Fishermen's Wharf area but I came to find the Omni's location to be the perfect spot to explore the whole city. We walked as well as rode the cable cars (there is a stop right in front of the hotel) as well as the F Line street cars to get around. I highly recommend the Omni.
172,2131,"Aug 5 2008 	Excellent Stay at the Omni	All of the prior reviews are true - the Omni is excellent. It may have been the nicest hotel we have ever stayed in - definitely in the top two. We stayed for two nights at the end of July. We had a 15th floor room with a partial view of the city. The rate we paid included valet parking for each night, normally an additional $48 per night charge. The room was large and very clean. The bathroom had a double sink with a very large countertop.The hotel was very convenient to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. The entrance to Chinatown was only a short walk from the hotel and the cable car route to Fisherman's Wharf stopped right in front of the hotel. Our rental car was parked on Friday afternoon and we did not retrieve it until we left on Sunday.The service had the hotel was exemplary. Each employee we encountered was very friendly and helpful. The hotel concierge gave us a great overview of the area and the doormen provided excellent dining tips.As members of Omni's Select Guest program, we were treated with complimentary beverage service each morning, consisting of a pot of coffee and tea and a choice of several fruit juices, along with a choice of three newspapers. This service was very prompt - we requested 8:00 each morning, and the beverages arrived by 7:30. This service allowed us to enjoy our coffee and tea and newspaper before heading out to breakfast. Two excellent breakfast locations within walking distance were Lori's Diner and Sears' Fine Food.As several other reviewers mentioned, there is free bottled water and fruits available in the 3rd floor Fitness Center.One local feature not to be missed is the lounge located on the 52nd floor of the Bank of America building, located across the street from the Omni. The nighttime view of the city through the lounge's wall of windows was spectacular."
173,2131,"Jul 30 2008 	Excellent Service	My wife and I stayed at the Omni as part of an anniversary trip through California.When we checked in late on Saturday night the person at the front desk acted as though they could not be bothered. She spoke in half sentences, didn't provide any information and just said &quot;sign here and here are your keys&quot; - and we were the only ones checking in.The next morning we talked to Monica at the front desk about our experience and she could not have been better. She was understanding, apologized and immediately asked what she could do to make it better (she sent up champagne and strawberries and also gave us vouchers for breakfast.) But more importantly she mades us feel like we were the only ones staying at the hotel- like our personal satisfaction was the most important thing.Everybody at the Omni (with the execption of the woman at check-in) was extraordinarily pleasant and helpful. The rooms were nice and the location was ideal. We'll be back for sure."
174,2131,"Jul 30 2008 	Very Nice	We stayed at the Omni SF, for four nights, in a standard room. Very clean, well furnished and we were very happy. It is clear by the fact that most of the other guests were in suits, it is more for the business person, but although we did feel out of place in our shorts and t-shirts, we were made to feel very welcome by the very friendly staff. The restaurant was over priced for the food, in my view. Better to eat out. Overall, a great stay, and a great location, with a Cable Car route right outside."
175,2131,"Jul 29 2008	Our stay at the Omni was great!	My best friend and I stayed 10 days at the San Fran Omni in late April 2008. It is a great hotel. It was very clean, the room was a nice size, bathroom was large, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. There was internet available in the lobby for a fee. In the future, I will always look for an Omni hotel to stay at, especially when in a large city. It has a restaurant and a separate bar/grill also. The restaurant served huge portions, everything was cooked to perfection, we ate there twice during our stay. The bar/grill was nice also, nice menu selections, such as crab tacos (yum), burgers, sliced steak. It is in the financial district and on the cable car line also. Close to Chinatown. We also ate at Houston's, across from the Ferry Building, excellent, especially the ribs, it was pricey but well worth it. The highlights of the trip for us were Alcatraz tour, Napa Wine-tasting tour, and Monterey-Carmel tour."
176,2131,"Jul 29 2008 	Loved it! Fabulous Anniversary!!!!	Everything was perfect from the time I made my reservations until the day we left. We made reservations to celebrate our anniversary and do a quick in-town getaway. The Omni is located in the financial district, but is close to many great neighborhoods. We were able to walk to the Embarcadero, North Beach, and Chinatown. It is also really close to public transportation, including BART and the Cable Car (for real tourists).Originally I was going to just spend one night in a suite, but the reservationist suggested that since we were coming for our anniversary, we consider their &quot;Hearts in San Francisco&quot; package. We decided to do this instead for 2 nights. It included a deluxe room with King bed, champagne and chocolates in the evening, and breakfast either at the restaurant on site or served in your room.I called ahead to see if they had any suggestions for a special anniversary dinner and they made us reservations at Aqua. We checked in online and simply had to pick up our keys and go straight to our room upon arrival. When we got to the room, housekeeping had put a heart of rose petals on our bed. Within 20 minutes our champagne and chocolates arrived. There was also a reminder letter with our key to give us directions to the restaurant which is only 2 blocks away. I also called for suggestions of somewhere to go after dinner and was given the perfect spot at the Bubble Lounge.The next day was just as wonderful and with the same treatment of the room the next night was completely romantic. Everyone at this hotel is friendly and helpful. It all started with Joey Nubla (concierge), to Darrell at the front door, to our bellmen Adam and Joey, our fabulous housekeeper Maria, the room service staff and John and Justin at the front desk. Thank you all for giving us the perfect getaway for our anniversary!"
177,2131,"Jul 29 2008 	Absolutely great	Brilliant location near Chinatown, very friendly staff, beautiful and tasteful room. Excellent breakfast! We felt at home right from the start and would certainly return. A Chinese couple next to us just got married and half of their party came with them to celebrate an after party in the middle of the night. Luckily this did not take too long. We loved the handwritten note of the housekeeping lady, thanking us for giving her the opportunity to clean our room. It's typical to this place."
178,2131,"Jul 27 2008 	Lovely Hotel	We stayed at the Omni Hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of July. After a 10 hour flight and 8 hours time difference, it was the perfect place to retreat to.We had previously stayed at the Omni Parker House Hotel in Boston, which exceeded our expectations, so after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to book the Omni San Francisco.The two adjoining rooms we stayed in were spacious, very clean and comfortable; the hotel staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming and the restaurant is to be recommended, although there are plenty of restaurants etc within walking distance.Would definitely stay at this hotel in future."
179,2131,"Jul 26 2008 	Poor Experience	I stayed here for 3 nights in July 07 for a business trip so a little late in posting feedback but thought I should still contribute.OVERALLI completely failed to see why this hotel is rated so highly. The location and checkin were good but everything else from the lobby, room and broadband were poor. I cannot recommend this hotel especially with other good options nearby. In particular, the Mandarin Oriental is nearby and is often priced competitively which means you'll be paying similar money to the Omni but for a VASTLY superior hotel.Let me emphasize that I do not feel the Omni is bad. The problem is that it is just ok and that there are options.GOODFast checkin. Pleasant staff. Decent location.BADSmall room. Front lobby unimpressive. &quot;Broadband&quot; speeds slow."
180,2131,"Jul 26 2008 	Good location excellent service comfortable rooms	Excellent location in financial district, an easy walk to North Beach, Chinatown, Union Square, SFMOMA, BART, etc. Beautiful lobby. Truly outstanding service with gracious, well trained staff. Room was large with extra room for a writing desk and a good sized sitting chair. Bathroom was clean, modern, and recently remodeled. High-quality mattress on the bed; room had a small flat screen TV (37 inch?). Decoration is in a traditional style. Breakfast in downstairs restaurant was OK, but nothing special, for example the OJ was not fresh. Only real complaint was the carpet in the room was a little tired - not disgusting - but no longer new and starting to show its age."
181,2131,"Jul 23 2008 	We Love The Omni	The Omni San Francisco staff made me smile every day of our stay in June. Our check in was great. My husband mentioned that we were celebrating our 30th wedding aniversary (15 years a piece) to Justin Seeto, the Guest Services Manager. Although he was not able to upgrade our room that night, the following afternoon we were moved to a lovely upgrade with a good bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. That is when I really started smiling! Lex ,at the concierge desk was delightful. He took time with us to find out our interests before making some great recommendations for dining and entertainment. If you haven't done it the Alcatraz cruise is a must. We loved Golden Gate park with the De Young museum and the Tea Gardens. A short walk from there is Haight Asbury, interesting. Good restaurant, Cha Cha Cha, Caribean tapas. We loved Mamacita, gormet Mexican and the Boulevard is a must do. We were lucky enough to catch the Frida Kalo exhibit at SFMOMA which we also loved.I digress, in short everyone we encountered at the Omni was friendly, personable and seemed to be enjoying making guests happy. The dorrmen were sweethearts, with a cold water in hand on an uncharacteristically warm summer day, the housekeepers were terrific and I had a great chat with a maintenance guy on the elevator. They all made a difference and made our stay at the Omni an absolute delight. Can't wait to return."
182,2131,"Jul 22 2008	I'll be back!	From the moment the front door was opened on our way in to check in to the time the front door was opened on our way after check out, my girlfriend and I were treated like royalty at the Omni. I've been to San Francisco many times and the Omni is the BEST hotel I've stayed in. The service is exquisite. Everyone from the doorman to the front desk personnel to the housekeeping staff is exceptionally friendly, always upbeat, and very helpful. The hotel itself is very clean, elegant, and conveniently located close to Chinatown, North Beach, and the Financial District. The California Street Cable Car line runs past the hotel's front door, and the BART station is five blocks away. The room was large, clean, and well maintained. There was a nice flat screen TV and DVD player in our upgraded &quot;signature&quot; room, though not every room may be equipped similarly. Every morning our housekeeper would leave us a handwritten note wishing us a pleasant day. We'd write her back telling her of our travel adventures and leave her a well-deserved tip for her service. She even recommended a great place to try authentic dim sum! Staying at the Omni was definitely the key to a most enjoyable San Francisco adventure! I'll be back to San Francisco soon and, without a doubt, will be staying at the Omni again!"
183,2131,Jul 21 2008 	Good hotel in central location	We have stayed in the Omni San Francisco before so it was the natural choice for a return visit. The staff in general were helpful particularly the door men - it is nice to get the door opened for you! We had a few probs - the keys issued to our party did not open the doors and we were left standing on the corridor with our luggage whist the security checked our ID again before they could re-issue our cards - no proper apology from the reception desk as I would have expected. Also we had one of our rooms booked for three but only one king bed !- they sent up a rollaway - at no extra charge - I would hope so as we had paid for 3 people!We had booked a suite and a bedroom and they put us in the corner suite area which was very handy - suite was quite spacious - flowers in bathroom and fruit were supplied - nice touch. Beware double beds are tiny and really do not fit 2 people. Thet now charge for use of their internet business room - so take your laptop - it is free for 'select guests ' in the lobby - you can print airline boarding passes for free for a restricted number of airlines - but would be better if they had access to international ones as well! Overall a nice hotel - though like many hotels in San francisco it is quite pricey - SF hotels are pricier than NYC or Boston Breakfast is expensive for what you get - much better value in the Omni in Boston! - which is hard to beat for breakfast!
184,2131,"Jul 18 2008 	loved the omni	The omni was a great location. The hotel was nice, with nice rooms. What made the stay so great was the service. All the staff were really grade a from beginning to end. The things I didn't like was that the room was very small, with only two double beds, not queen. The food prices were very high, even for san francisco, so eating at the hotel was not an option. Would have been convenient to eat at hotel for breakfast."
185,2131,"Jul 16 2008 	I can see why the Omni is rated so high.	My wife and I stayed there at the end of June then again in early July while vacationing in San Francisco. The service was excellent, from the check in to the doorman. Everyone makes you feel very welcome. The beds are very comfortable with large plush pillows. The bathroom are immaculate and clean. The location is central to everything, you can walk to Union Square, North Beach, Little Italy, the Bart (subway) in no time. I would definitely recommend the Omni to anyone and everyone."
186,2131,Jul 15 2008	10 in all areas	This was one of the most enjoyable hotel experiences I have had in years. The hotel was immaculate and the staff was more then accomodating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the San Francisco area.
187,2131,"Jul 11 2008 	Omni was fabulous	We stayed at the Omni over the 4th of July weekend (got a great rate at $169 a night)! We enjoyed everything about our stay there. From the doormen who were super, to the front desk staff and everyone in between--fabulous service. We liked the fact that it was not in the middle of everything, because San Francisco was crazy over that weekend! The financial district is very quiet on weekends, which, like another poster said, we liked. We were at the end of a 10 day trip out west and thought the Omni was the best hotel we stayed at, and we stayed at nice hotels! We checked in early, no problem, and when we were leaving they held our luggage all day because our flight wasn't until 10:00 that night. We loved all the personal touches and luxurious bedding and robes! As an added tip, we joined their hotel rewards program when making the reservations (it's free to join) and that got us extra perks like coffee/juice/paper in the morning, get fit kit and the room and a few more things. I would recommend this!This was our first visit at an Omni hotel and would look for an Omni property again when traveling."
188,2131,"Jul 7 2008 	Beautiful hotel great location!	I just spent two nights at the Omni in San Francisco at the end of a 10-day trip to various California sites. We had three couples in our party. The hotel is beautifully decorated, had conscientious staff, great sheets. It's location is two blocks from Chinatown in the Financial District, and the street car runs right in front of the hotel. We needed quick transportation one evening in order to make our Alcatraz Tour, and the doorman provided two town cars for our party and we only had to tip the drivers. Because of its location, our 9th floor room overlooked the top of the Wells Fargo Bank and a Subway shop.There is a complimentary coffee maker in the room and a daily newspaper. We were very disappointed to be charged $10 a day for wireless internet access, since every other hotel we had stayed at in California provided this service for free.There is no parking. Valet parking service provided by the hotel is $48 a day plus tipping the driver! There is St. Mary's Parking Garage one block away with the awesome rate of $32 a day! The phone in the bathroom, lighted closet, and nightly turn-down service was nice."
189,2131,"Jul 2 2008 	Good 4-star hotel in a great location	We stayed at the Omni for 3 nights. Our room was available when we checked in at noon and we had a late check-out at 2pm. The check-in staff are friendly and very prompt. The room is a good size, the bed is comfortable, and the amenities are good. The decor is a bit tired, but clean and tidy. Wi-fi is $9.95 for 24 hours. There is a turndown service every evening, which is a very nice touch. The staff at the concierge desk are knowledgable and very helpful. They sell tourist muni passports which is excellent (1 day for $11), and a very helpful female staff showed us how to get to the various attractions. There is complimentary lemonade and fruit late afternoon in the lobby. The location is excellent. The Ferry Building to the right, Chinatown to the left and Union Square to the south. Tadich Grill, an SF institution is 4 blocks right of the hotel, and we stumbled upon it by a very fortunate mistake. Unwittingly, we were in SF for the Gay Pride parade, which we happily attended. The atmosphere was fantastic. We booked through Expedia.co.nz, and paid NZ$266 per night (including taxes) which was very reasonable."
190,2131,"Jul 1 2008 	20th Anniversary Stay was Terrific	I have stayed in many hotels all over the world. The Omni service was exceptional which is why this hotel is so highly rated. The &quot;premium&quot; class room on the top floor (17th) was large with the usual first-class amenities - king size bed, armoire holding the TV - mini-bar-drawers for clothing, a writing table and a chair. The room was very much like other major UPSCALE hotel chains but nothing palacial. The room was accurately described as having a &quot;partial view&quot; so I was not expecting more than this. I could see the bay but I also saw a lot of the side of the L-shaped Omni itself. The only hotel that I saw there that I would like to investigate next time was the Intercontinental Mark (somebody). It is a high rise on Nob Hill which is elevated already so I am sure the views were pretty spectacular. I am sure the price is as well. We had brunch at the Top of the Mark which is - you guessed it - on the top floor and we saw the view ourselves. Spectacular. But back to the Omni...When we told the concierge that this was our 20th Wedding Anniversary, they immediately arranged to have champagne and chocolate covered strawberries delivered to our room - complimentary. Having a bottle of champagne around just changes the whole mood of a hotel room - I highly recommend it. I am not suggesting that you lie about it being your anniversary, though.I had the 3-1/2 days in San Fran very well scheduled before we arrived because I wanted to make the most of our short stay, so I took the wind out of the concierge's sails when I showed him my calendar chart of restaurant reservations, Alcatraz cruise, Wok Wiz Chinatown tour, etc, but I would have missed the opportunity of eating at the Slanted Door if the concierge had not pointed out that they were in fact open for lunch (I had seen information indicating they only opened at 5 and could not work it into our evening time slots.) Tiger prawns, Vietnamese crepes, beef short ribs. WoW!One complaint: when you stay at the hotel that is rated #1, any little thing that is wrong will seem like a big deal. For instance, I had to take the coffee service tray out of the armoire and set it on the table and then I had to crawl under the table to reach the electrical outlet just to get it plugged in. I found myself getting quite indignant (silly pride) at the effort I had to personally exert just to hook up the thing. I have done this before in other hotels and not been nearly as bothered. Lesson: limit your expectations and you will always be more satisfied.Also: This is in the Financial District. While we never felt like we were out of the main part of town, it does get quiet on weekends. This was pleasant to us. You are still only a few blocks from Union Square, the Ferry Building, and Chinatown and you have cable cars running directly in front of the hotel. You will not feel isolated in the least. The location was perfect and in no way diminished our stay."
191,2131,"Jun 30 2008	Loved the hotel service sucked!	While the hotel itself was nice, if not bit pricey, the service was not. There was a conference while we were there and a disco had been set up right below our room for the conference attendees. The floor was shaking the music was so loud. As the hotel was oversold we couldn't be moved and the only thing they offered to do for us was pay for a cab to another hotel, no offer of rooms elsewhere or anything. Oh...we did get a &quot;free&quot; overpriced breakfast out of it. Don't eat in the dining room, way overpriced for what you get...$25 for Bacon and Eggs?Would not stay there again, not for the amount we paid and the service we got."
192,2131,"Jun 29 2008 	Memorable Stay - Superb Service	My husband and I recently spent a birthday week-end at the Omni San Francisco. This was our first stay at an Omni property and we were so impressed that we actually checked to see if there was a hotel in Fort Lauderdale which is where we'll be vacationing next (We have a reservation at a Hilton property but would have switched to the Omni given the wonderful experience we had with them in San Fran.).The front desk staff were very helpful and courteous. We were quite impressed with Crystal who not only answered our questions about hotel amenities but she also anticipated our needs and made arrangements to have them met. We were always greeted with a friendly hello by all staff we passed - be it at the front door, in the elevator or in the hallways. There appears to be a seamless team effort to provide polite service at all times and this was quite refreshing to experience. There were personal touches added to the room which we really appreciated. The linens were fresh and clean. Our only disappointment was that there was not much of a view from the room (perhaps because we had requested a quiet area of the hotel?). The hotel is in an excellent location, albeit sedate on the week-end as it's in the Financial district within close proximity to the shopping area on Market street, Little Italy and Chinatown. BART and MUNI are available nearby. We hope to be returning guests."
193,2131,"Jun 26 2008 	A few glitches - but nice	My wife and I decided to take a long weekend, including a Monday off work, and spend it in San Francisco. We chose the Omni based on its reputation and location. Both lived up to expectations but for one glitch - the internet was down our entire stay.First the good. The location is perfect; in the heart of the embarcadero and financial districts and on the outskirts of China Town. You can easily walk to the farmers market (Sat and Tues), Coit tower, China Town, North beach or Union Square. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient and the Hotel was a pleasant level of old school; clean, comfortable and well cared for. We booked a &quot;signature room&quot;, which was a good size and high up on the 16th of 17 floors. Our package included parking and internet for $239 a night. Ask for this package when booking. The restaurant bar in the lobby, Bob's Bar (not the steakhouse) had great food and drinks and seems to be where locals and local business people hang out - it was fun.Now the minor bad - which left a bad taste. The internet, which they charge for in standard rooms and even the business center, was out all three days. Each time we called, the front desk gave us a differnt explanation and a different timeframe for its solution. We wanted the internet to search for restaurants, events and attractions. We also needed it to access our offices to justify a last minute day off. I asked if we could use the business office internet and they said sure, &quot;swipe your credit card&quot; Internet was free in our room but we had to pay - not cool."
194,2131,Jun 23 2008 	It was purdy good	This hotel was purdy good.
195,2131,"Jun 22 2008 	Outstanding Customer Service/Wonderful amenities	We just arrived home from a four night stay at the Omni San Francisco to celebrate our Anniversary. The Customer Service and attention to detail was outstanding. They took care of our every need and far exceeded our expectations. We had such wonderful celebration and stay as we knew if we needed anything, they we be there for us. We felt so pampered, we almost hated to leave. When we inquired how to get around by car, cable car and even buses, where to mail letters, packages the Front Desk and Conceirge staff provided every detail. When we needed to send a package, they gave us a box, the tape and even shipped it for us. The had every amenity we could need and more. When we inquired as to where to eat or get a bottle of wine to celebrate, they gave us all the help we could possibly need. The Valets and Bell hops were on top of every thing, even when we just needed to find out where to stand to catch the cable car. The location of the hotel is wonderul to get around the city and see the sites, as you are in the middle of it all. The bed was heavenly and the room was quiet. We look forward to the next time we will be able to stay there."
196,2131,"Jun 21 2008 	Where's the pool??	Its a nice hotel but contrary to the reviews, its not fantastic. Someone rated their pool as above average. Foolishly, I didn't look into it as i actually wanted to use the pool. I was surprised on arrival to find out that they don't actually have one!!!The staff are very friendly but that is usually a standard american thing in a high star hotel. The rooms are all nice and reasonably spacious for the price although a little stuffy for some reason (maybe the weather) but again, not all that fantastic as the reviews seem to suggest. The location is great in the center of town, the breakfast and the food average, the bed was okay, not fantastic. I've definitely stayed in better"
197,2131,"Jun 21 2008 	This is what every hotel should aim to be like	We arrived very late after a long drive from Vegas as part of our honeymoon tour of CA, and were greeted by exceptionally friendly helpful staff, unbelievably clean rooms, excellent facilities...need I go on. An absolute must for an extra special city visit."
198,2131,"Jun 20 2008 	Best hotel in San Francisco	I was in San Francisco on business and stayed at the Omni for four nights this June. EVERYTHING is great about this hotel! The staff are extremely friendly, and will go out of their way to help you with ANYTHING you could possibly need. I've stayed at other hotels in San Francisco and there are hotels that more modern / chique, but none of them beat the Omni - It's a classic."
199,2131,"Jun 20 2008 	would highly recommend this hotel	We stayed in this hotel on a recent visit to san franciso and would highly recommend it, from start to finish the service was impeccable and i could not find one thing to fault. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by the friendly porter and directed to the front desk where again the welcome was great (but not overwhelming) and check in was quick and efficent. Room was excellent - very comfortable with a huge bed and excellent bathroom (good shower). For me it was the little touches that made the stay so enjoyable - the chocolates, the ice bucket that was refilled every night, the weather forecast by the phone; as well as the attentive and friendly staff. As we spent most of our time sightseeing we only ate room service one night and never ate in the restauarant - both restauarant and bar looked very nice though. Location is great - walking distance from all the sights though can be a bit quiet on a sunday. If im in san francisco again this is where ill be staying!"
200,2131,"Jun 18 2008 	Great hotel location and friendly staff!	We stayed at the Omni hotel after reading all the reviews on Trip advisor. I have to say that they were true! The Omni hotel is a great place with a very friendly staff. We arrived early (10:30a) and a room was waiting for us. After signing up on their website, we ended up with coffee and juice delivered to our room every morning. We also had breakfast included. The restaurant was great. The staff there welcomed us each morninng and we had the choice as far as menu. I had steak and eggs one morning. Just fabulous! The meat was very tender.We will definetely stay there again. Perfect location as well."
201,2131,"Jun 17 2008	Best Hotel Experience Ever!	We had a wonderful experience. I am 40ish and my daughter, 20. We went to SF for girl's trip. Omni staff was absolutely excellent. Genuine smiles, friendliest &amp; kindest staff..even our housekeeper left hand-written notes daily. Clean &amp; beautiful lobby, halls, &amp; room. Special touches everywhere. Every single person we came in contact with was genuine and helpful. Great location two blocks from Chinatown. Paid $209 one night and $199 the other. Room size was also good for price paid."
202,2131,"Jun 16 2008 	Omni Made My 1st San Fran Trip a 1st Class Joy!	As always, I checked TripAdvisor first when planning my first trip to San Francisco and based on the No. 1 rating of the Omni from previous travelers, I decided to give it a shot. Was I ever impressed. It is a lovely hotel in the Financial District of the city and very near Union Square. Not only are the common areas and the room truly beautiful, each member of the staff that I encountered was extremely courteous and sincerely willing to ensure that I was having a great time. I plan to return to see more of the city and will definitely be staying at the Omni."
203,2131,"Jun 14 2008 	Top Class Service.	The Omni is a superb hotel. The Staff from Reception, Concierge, Housekeeping etc. were the best ever I have experienced. ALL HOTEL STAFF WORLDWIDE SHOULD BE TRAINED HERE!. The hotel is located within easy reach of everything with a trolley stop just outside for those who don't like walking. The only minor fault is the cost of Breakfast in the restaurant- it cost us $80 for two &amp; as it's located in the financial district there is not a great selection of restaurants nearby, unless all you want is a coffee &amp; bagel."
204,2131,"Jun 10 2008 	Omni is a good hotel in a good location	My fiance and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco this past weekend. We found the staff to be extremely friendly. We didn't walk through the lobby once without a &quot;how are you?&quot; or &quot;Is there anything I can help you with?&quot;The room was on the small end but still very nice. The location was good but required a short walk to get to the tourist locations. The price was reasonable for San Francisco. The only downside in my mind was that we were charged $48 / day for our rental car to be parked in the garage. Seemed a bit steep. Overall, we enjoyed the hotel and would recommend it to anyone."
205,2131,"Jun 10 2008 	what a great hotel	Everything about this hotel is perfect. The location is superb, near the sights but quiet at nightime with a trolley stop almost outside the door. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The staff are amazing, everyone of them went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. One of the best hotels I have stayed in, can't wait to go back."
206,2131,Jun 9 2008 	Very Social and fun staff..	I received a great rate in a middle tier room. I reserved the room on the companies website and requested the best (and highest room available) for my room rate. They gave me a great room on the top floor with a great view of the city and bay! The staff was very social and helpful making us feel at home! I would go back and stay at this hotel for the staff alone!
207,2131,Jun 7 2008 	A little pricey	We stayed at the Omni for 2 nights we booked through Hotwire. We paid like $730.00. The room was average. They need to update the t.v.'s.It was just an okay stay. I would have rather stayed at the Westin Market street. The concierge is extremely helpful!!!
208,2131,"Jun 6 2008 	Favorite hotel in 20 years of travel	Traveled quite a bit and stayed in some of the country's top hotels but as far as room quality (including value), comfort of atmosphere and service the Omni SF is at the top of my list. Great place to stay while in the city (was at the Orchard a few nights earlier bc of its reviews and it's not even close), or any city."
209,2131,"Jun 2 2008 	A great hotel	We had only two nights at the Omni in May. We were on our way home to NZ after 6 weeks travelling in Europe laden with luggage!What a pleasure it was to arrive at the Omni after negotiating the chaos of Los Angeles Airport! We arrived at 8.30 am and our room was not available but hotel reception couldn't have been more helpful in storing bags, offering bathrooms and recommending places for coffee or breakfast. The manager personally hurried up the availability of our room and had us safely ensconced by 10am.Our room was a standard king but so spacious by European hotel room standards. It was immaculately clean and well appointed. Our only negative comment would be that there was no kettle for boiling water for a cup of tea. There was a coffee maker available but to just boil water in that took forever! The bed was large and firm with comfortable pillows and crisp linen. Nice range of toiletries in the bathroom which were replaced twice daily if needed-a nice touch.Our room was facing into a central area so only view was of other buildings. The upside of this was that we got no road noise whatsoever-Lovely and quiet so would probably request same on return visit.Hotel is in financial area so if here on holiday as we were, not too many restaurants or cafes in the immediate vicinity. This was a bit of an issue especially as we were there on a Sunday night and a Monday which was a public holiday so virtually nothing around. North beach though is only a short taxi ride away.The strength of this hotel though was its outstanding staff. They were respectful, extremely helpful and willing to answer all queries and wishes in a friendly courteous way.Wold we stay here again?---A resounding yes."
210,2131,"May 31 2008 	Great Stay at the Omni	We had a great stay at the Omni San Francisco over the Memorial Day holiday. Although there was no view, our room was well appointed and clean. Staff was friendly and service was above average. Service technician replaced our television set becuase it was not working. Location, in the financial district, was good even though rather dead on Sunday and Memorial Day. Close to the Embarcadero and ferry building where restraunts were open on Sunday afternoon. We would stay here again on another trip to San Francisco."
211,2131,"May 31 2008 	great service	The Omni is a great find for the price. We paid an average of $180.00 a night. It is a about 2 blocks off the beaten path but in a nice safe area. The great thing is that the California trolley line goes right in front of the hotel so transportation is easy. We walked to the North Beach district and to Union Square. Fisherman's warf is easy to get to by trolley. (buy the daily pass for $11 p/p) The rooms were very clean and updated as was the lobby. It is small but has a restaurant and a small bar that serves a small menu. If you want a very quiet room but with no view, request an inner courtyard. I have stayed in both and the street side rooms have the view to the street if you don't mind the city noises - not bad though."
212,2131,"May 28 2008 	Clean beautiful and amazing customer service at the Omni.	We stayed at the Omni San Francisco for my dad's 65th birthday. My family was so impressed with the hotel. Not only were the rooms immaculate, the bathrooms were so clean you could eat off the floor. Omni's customer service was amazing... Everyone was so helpful in suggesting local restaurants, where to order pizza, etc. The concierge was GREAT and even surprised my dad with a small birthday cake and more. I consider myself to be a hotel snob and cannot say enough good things about this place. The location was GREAT too."
213,2131,"May 28 2008 	Fantastic SF Hotel!	Everything about the hotel was fantastic - clean, beautiful, central location (walking distance to most everything), restaurant, bar, etc. But, the best part of the hotel was the staff - everyone we came in contact with was friendly, helpful, nice and just pleasant. Great stay. Will definitely stay the next time in SF."
214,2131,"May 28 2008 	Great Hotel Great Location Great Kids Room Great City...	A great classic and classy hotel. The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is luxurious, and extremely kid-friendly in a city that is not really kid-centric. We were lucky enough to book the Kid Fantasy Suite for my kids (ages 9 and 11) with an adjoining King room for my husband and I. While there is much more the decorators could have done to make it a true kid &quot;fantasy&quot; room, it made my kids feel like they were special. Bunk beds, bean bags and nightly milk &amp; cookies -- what more could a kid want?! (Well, a pool would have been ideal, but they didn't mind too much).The restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steak House, was fantastic. A little pricey, but typical for the city and the food was worth it. There are several outstanding restaurants within an easy two block walk of the hotel.We were there over a long weekend, and it seemed many cafes and smaller restaurants were closed for the weekend, or had very limited hours. (The closest McDonald's was completely closed on Sunday -- not a big deal unless you have a 9-year-old craving a Happy Meal)But the location was great in regards to the ease in getting to public transportation. Also, there are a ton of things within walking distance -- China Town, the Ferry Building, Union Square.The service at the Omni is wonderful! Everything from the front desk staff to the housekeepers to the room service attendants. I could go on an on about this hotel, but to simply summarize: if you are going to San Fran, stay here!"
215,2131,"May 27 2008 	Solid and convenient hotel	I stayed at the Omni for 2 nights over Memorial Day weekend. I got a great weekend rate at $169 a night. LOCATION: The location could not be any better. We took the BART and walked 4 blocks (10 minutes) to the hotel. Just make sure you don't have too much luggage. The hotel is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. There are also Muni lines and cable car lines very close by.HOTEL:I knew that it was an older hotel, but I guess I expected the rooms to be nicer. It is very clean, but there was no &quot;wow&quot; factor that I have seen at other hotels like Novotel Singapore or Venetian in Vegas. It was a regular room with regular t.v. with nice amenities but nothing ultra-modern. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, although you could hear some hallway noise, but nothing from outside the building. I guess that is why they are not considered a 5 star hotel. Minus one star for the room.SERVICE:The service was very good overall. Check in was quick and all the staff were extremely friendly. We are a select guest, so we get morning beverage service (you are supposed to get a card outside your room and you hang it out with your beverages). Since this is our first stay, we had no idea how this worked. We never got a card and got no beverages in the morning. When I called the front desk, they forwarded me to room service, and I got my beverages. I also told front desk that I didn't get a beverage card, just a room service, when they asked if I hung it outside. Well, for a #1 rated Tripadvisor and 4 star hotel, I would expect a select guest beverage card the following night, but no. So, minus one star for that. However, when I wanted coffee the next morning at 11:00 a.m. (they have a pot of coffee in Bob's every morning until 10:00 a.m.), the staff got me one, so add one star.Overall, this is a great hotel with great service. I can see why it is not 5 stars, but the service really makes it above the rest.HOTEL TIPS:Get free water and fruit in the fitness room. There is also free fruit in the afternoon and free lemonade in the lobby. There is free coffee in the morning at Bob's bar until 10:00 a.m. But, you get free beverage service delivered to your room if you sign up as a selected guest.RESTAURANT TIPS:We found two great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Both are highly rated on yelp. The first is Bix. It is on Gold St., which is about 5 blocks north of Montgomery (10 minutes walk). It's in a small alley, and the food is awesome and moderately priced (entrees $25 to 35 range). Their appetizers are incredible, and the atmosphere is very nice. The second is Great Eastern in Chinatown for dim sum. This place is located on Jackson St. by Kearny. It is very clean compared to the other Chinatown places, and you order off of a menu with pictures (no carts). Service is a bit slow, but if you are looking for an adventure in Chinatown, definitely try dim sum there. Go early (before 11:00) to avoid the crazy crowds!"
216,2131,"May 19 2008 	Great Hotel! Can't wait to go back	My husband, baby, and I stayed at the Omni for 3 nights in March. I've never experienced such great service. From the moment we arrived, we were treated with great hospitality. The lady that checked us in even asked if she could hold our baby and played with him for a little while. it was really cute. We were upgraded to a suite, which was beautiful. Any questions we had, or service, we needed was handled with genuine kindness and efficiency. My baby's blanket was accidentally taken by the cleaning staff. Omni took all measures to locate it, and then refunded 1 night off the bill and treated us to a free breakfast. We thought that was really nice. We have great memories, and can't wait to stay there again. We tell all of our friends who visit San Francisco about this experience, and recommend it highly."
217,2131,"May 19 2008 	Best Hotel Ever!	We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. Extremely clean (even the hallways smelled clean). Large rooms, windows opened, extremely comfortable bed (most hotels are lumpy and over used), great selection of snacks and other amenities, mints, sleep balm, cards, anything you desire! Wonderful extra friendly staff, always available to help. Went as a surprise for my husband's 40th birthday and they sent up a complementary cake, champagne and birthday card. Great location, 1 block from China Town, Easy access to cable cars!We will definately stay there again!!!"
218,2131,"May 12 2008 	Fantastic weekend	For my birthday this year, my husband surprised me with a trip to San Francisco, and a stay in the Omni hotel. From the second we arrived until we had to return, we found the hotel and its staff faultless. We arrived early, hoping to be able to drop off our bags until the room was ready, but were delighted to be told that not only was our room ready, but they had upgraded us to a suite! The room was beautiful, with loads of space to chill out and relax. Returning that evening after a day of sightseeing, I was surprised yet again, as they had laid on cake and champagne for my birthday. The omni certainly know how to pamper a girl. The next day, we both felt thoroughly relaxed after sleeping in the very comfortable beds. The breakfasts were fantastic, with truly excellent service. My husband booked the champagne and strawberries package which were delivered that evening, and once again the presentation and execution was impeccable. The rose petals on the bed were an extra special touch. I would highly recommend the Omni Hotel and its wonderful staff, and look forward to returning there in the future."
219,2131,"May 9 2008 	The Omni went above and beyond	My best friend and I went to San Francisco for a girls weekend and had the best time. The hotel was fantastic. From greeting us with roses and first class service upon checking in, to our beautifully appointed room.  It was a deluxe room with two double beds, marble bathroom, with no real views but very comfortable. We are wary of hotels but felt right at home at the Omni, as everything was clean and comfortable. I have stayed in Fairmonts and nicer hotels, and I would say that this hotel was at par with a 4+ star, it was great. My girlfriend celebrated a birthday during our stay and we only mentioned it to the front desk clerk when asked why in town, after dinner one night they sent up a bottle of champagne, two small birthday cakes and a personalized card. It was perfect! The gym was great, tv's on all the equipment and was never full, or even half full. Get your water there as there is complimentary water, and the bottle in your room is $6. Oh and there is also fresh fruit in the gym, which might be a nice snack as the mini bar and room service are quite pricey. Which isn't too much of a problem since the Omni is near alot of nice cafes, restaurants etc. (right beside the Omni there is a cafe which has everything and makes delicious panini's.... which are worth the trip back to San Francisco). We never ordered anything from the hotel.... except a bagel and fruitplate in the morning.... and it wasn't outrageous. No pool, no views, but what the hotel lacks in those areas, it completely compensates for in friendly helpful staff. It is close to China town, Union square, North beach and across the street from the Carmelian room which has amazing views while you dine. Become an Omni select guest member (free online) and you can get a complimentary morning beverage and paper, turn down service and upgrade after so many stays. Being on California street, alongside the cable cars, the Omni makes it easy to get around without a rental car. I would actually say avoid renting one if possible as parking in San Francisco is expensive and hard to come by. The hotel charges $45 I believe. So we rented one to drive up to win country, and returned it the same day, just to save us the hassle of paying for parking and returning it the next day.  San Francisco is a fantastic city and the hospitality extends far beyond the hotels and tourist areas. Everyone is so nice and made our trip so enjoyable. The Omni is a great hotel in a great location. We will return and as soon as we can."
220,2131,"May 4 2008 	Perfect	Beautifully located walking distance to North Beach for restaurants, Union square and fishermans wharf. Brilliant, friendly service - nothing was a problem. The service team went out of their way to help me - I felt like a King! The rooms are spacious (I had a king bed), and bathrooms are good size and have high quality finishes. The gym has all the gear you need, about 5 treadmills, some new resistance training gear and is very well presented.Whether you are staying for pleasure or business, this hotel is first class, highly recommend - it was also outstanding value!"
221,2131,"May 4 2008 	Great staff	From the moment we walked through the door at the Omni, the staff could not have been more helpful. John on the front desk, gave us maps with directions to all the tourist areas, recommended restaurants and because the bellman was very busy even brought our luggage up to our room himself. The location was great a 15 minute walk to union square and a pleasant 20 minutes walk to Fisherman's wharf. If you don't like walking the cable car stop is very close to the hotel.The only mild disappointment at the Omni was the high prices in the restuarant especially for breakfast.The trip to alcatraz from pier 33 is must, so remember to book in advance online as it will be very difficult to get tickets on the day as there tends to be a wait of several days.San Francisco was very enjoyable, and it helped to have such friendly staff at the Omni."
222,2131,Apr 29 2008 	Excellent hotel	This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. It is centerally located only a block away from china town and a couple from union square. The staff are the most helpful and friendly I have ever seen. From check in with a lady called Crystal she supplied us with maps gave good advice and was very helpful. Another member of staff from meeting me once remembered my name everytime he saw me. Its not the cheapest place but it is a very nice hotel and you wont regret booking here. The food is excellent as well.
223,2131,"Apr 26 2008 	GREAT San Francisco Hotel!	My wife and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco for four nights recently - and we simply loved our experience!The hotel has all of the services we could have wanted: very nice, comfortable rooms; an awesome concierge service (truly!); and one of the best hotel gyms that we've come across; among various other features.The absolute best part of the hotel, though, was the staff: everyone was warm and friendly - special rave reviews go to the doormen/valets and the front desk/concierge staffs . . . who were all as helpful as one could ask for.In fact, we happened to mention to the guest services representative/concierge who checked us in (Joey N.) that it was my birthday and that my wife had just arrived back in the States after overseas work travel . . . and he kindly surprised us by sending up a bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries - so very kind and generous!As for the hotel and the city: one is only minutes away from the Embarcadero (and the Ferry Building, a join in and of itself - but also the jumping off point for ferries to Sausalito, Tiburon, etc.) and Nob Hill - and a cable car line runs in front of the hotel. Given the weather, we walked all over - but even those not disposed to do so will find this hotel most convenient!All in all: a tremendous experience - at a very reasonable price!"
224,2131,"Apr 26 2008 	Extremely comfortable welcoming	I booked this hotel because of the great reviews. It is all true. The decor is lovely, the beds are really cozy and the fitness room is adequate. Best of all is the welcoming staff that is always available to offer suggestions or provide directions.We also really liked the location."
225,2131,"Apr 24 2008 	Delightful hotel in a great location	We spent four nights at this delightful hotel at the beginning of April. When we arrived we had to wait about 5 mins before the check-in staff were able to attend to us and this resulted in my wife being given a rose and also an upgrade to a very comfortable suite. Although the hotel is in the financial area which is a bit quiet at the weekend, it is ideally situated for most of the tourist areas. Public transportation is also very accessible from the hotel.The hotel has a very pleasant restaurant and bar, however I feel the cost of the meals in the restaurant was a bit excessive and the signature giant honey glazed carrot which seemed to accompany most of the meals was a bit wasted on us. On the last night we decided to stay in the bar as we had spent the day on a very enjoyable wine tour to the Napa valley. On this occasion we chose a bar meal which was extremely tasty and far better value for money.Although the cost of the rooms is expensive during the week, it is possible to get a good deal for Fri/Sat/Sun nights but I would recommend contacting the hotel directly. I would certainly stay at this hotel again and would recommend it."
226,2131,"Apr 17 2008 	A very nice hotel	This was overall a very nice hotel, in the financial district, which was nice, as it is much more mellow on the weekend. Service was very good, but I would say this hotel is probably a bit overrated. Some sites mistakenly say it has a jacuzzi, which it DOESN'T. The rooms are nice (old world style), room service is very helpful (as were all the people at front desk, bellmen, valets etc.) but the sheets were a bit on the rough side, the shower was average (and I'm being nitpicky here).Don't get me wrong: this is a VERY nice hotel. But if you're expecting the ultimate luxury with the very soft sheets, fancy bathrooms, for those aspects, I'd say it wasn't quite up to par with a five star hotel..."
227,2131,"Apr 17 2008 	Loved the Omni San Francisco	I really enjoyed my 2 night stay at the Omni last weekend. The hotel is very beautiful and historic from the outside and the location is excellent to explore the city. We easily walked to Chinatown and Embarcadero. Broadway, which offers the nightlife, is also a short distance away. Public transportation is also very accessible from the hotel.The lobby is really very pretty. The staff is very sweet and helpful. They always have a smile on their face. Our room was clean and very comfortable and tastefully decorated. It also overlooked Montgomery, which was nice.The only downfall about the hotel was the internet connection. WiFi was only available if you took your laptop to a certain location in the lobby. If you wanted a connection in your room it had to be done with a cable connection in the desk and the cost was $15 per day.We never ate at the hotel so I cannot comment on the quality of the food. But overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Omni. I would not hesitate to stay there again when I return to San Francisco."
228,2131,"Apr 15 2008 	loved the omni	We booked into the omni hotel after reading the trip advisor and expedia which I might add are my travel bibles. The web sites did not let us down.We were after quiet, gracious accommodation that epitimised San Francisco, and it was ordered.The hotel was everything we thought would make our San Francisco trip worthwhile. The room was well appointed and very quiet, the bar was very cosy and bar staff attentive. The breakfast was enjoyable and the counter staff were spot on in their recommendations for restaurants.As seasoned travellers I would thoroughly recommend this hotel , although it was in the financial district it did not deter in any way from transporting to all the hot spots, eg food, tourist areas etc."
229,2131,"Apr 14 2008	Nice not dazzling	Meh. After reading all the glowing reviews here, I expected more during my two week stay. The good: The member program is well worth signing up for -- the hot chocolate from complimentary morning beverage service is dense and European-style and comes with whipped cream and cinnamon marshmallows. Umbrellas in the lobby when it's raining outside.Gym is solid, with ellipticals and free weights.Get Fit kit.Most of the staff is attentive (hit or miss though). Seem way more responsive to families with little kids.Great location, decent steakhouse downstairs.The bad:Wireless internet connection blows.Can't leave tip on credit card.My shower curtain had mold on it.O.J. is not fresh-squeezed.Inconsistent housekeeping.Room set up in such a way that trying to close the door of TV armoire resulted in almost knocking over the lamp on nearby desk.Overall, can definitely tell the difference between a four star and a five star hotel."
230,2131,"Apr 11 2008 	Good stay at the Omni	Stayed Saturday night, the first day of our vacation at the Omni. Our room was on the 6th floor overlooking California St. It was quite comfortable and quiet although I don't know if it would be as quiet during the work week with much more traffic going by. Easy walk to Chinatown and the financial district. The California Cable car line runs right in front of the hotel. Easy connection to the Hyde and Powell line which takes you to Fisherman's Wharf area, Chinatown and Lombard Street. You can buy a day pass at the front desk. Our $200 rate included a Deluxe Room and valet parking ($45 otherwise.) and we thought this was reasonable for San Francisco. We were quite comfortable during our stay."
231,2131,"Apr 10 2008	Pleasant stay	We spent a long weekend at this hotel and found it to be a very pleasant place, particularly for San Francisco. Everything is gleaming, and in good taste. The staff is excellent; when we asked to have the feather pillows and feather blanket removed due to my wife's allergy, someone was completed the task rapidly and pleasantly. The location is great, with about a bazillion restaurants an easy walk from the hotel. The concierge knows what he's talking about and was very helpful. The apples and apple cider available in the late afternoon was very welcoming. You get street noise if your room faces california Street, so I would ask for a quiet room in the back and/or a room on the top floors. I would also self-park at the St. Mary's garage a very short walk away to avoid the steep valet parking charge."
232,2131,"Apr 7 2008 	Just returned from an excellent 10 day stay at a truly world class hotel!	We just returned from a 10 day family vacation to San Francisco where we enjoyed 2 connecting rooms at this exquisite hotel. Every moment spent at the San Francisco Omni Hotel was truly a pleasure! I could not have expected more from our entire experience at this hotel. From the timely communication about the reservation and on-line check-in options, the attentive and warm reception received from each staff member at the time of arrival, the wonderful daily amenities received as simply being a member of the FREE Select Guest program, impeccable housekeeping, exceptional dining through room service and Bob's restaurant, the special kid's program that allowed my daughter to feel just as special as we did each and every day...this hotel has all the bases covered! If you wish for your stay in San Francisco to be a true pleasure for both business and personal travel, you will not be disappointed by staying at this truly world class hotel!"
233,2131,"Apr 5 2008 	A Lovely Stay at the Omni	Very impressed with the online check in. We arrived after a long flight and as we had already &quot;checked in&quot; after receiving the offer to check in via email, so we were able to just collect our key and go straight to our room without having to wait to speak to anybody.Our room was beautifully furnished and we couldn't believe how quiet it was given that the Hotel is on a main road. The location is excellent, cable car runs along the road outside the Hotel and it is only a short walk to the shops in Union Square.I agree with a previous reviewer re the cost of breakfast - a little over priced - probably worth a wander to a nearby cafe. This is a Hotel that feels initmate and cosy, it retains a very classical San Francisco look - nicely done."
234,2131,"Apr 3 2008	Great deal for the money	We stayed in Omni for 2 nights during spring break. They upgraded us to 16th floor which was supposed to have free internet but it was not clear how to get this and we got free internet through their Select membership (another great tip from TripAdvisor), it was spotty but not too bad. The room was not big but nice. Comfortable beds, outstanding linens and blankets. The shower pressure was good too. Nice touches like chocolates, bathrobes, good San Francisco map in the room. I tried to share the bed with my 6 year old, but didn't sleep well, and on the second night I requested a rollaway bed. It was also very nice and they didn't charge us for it. The toilet paper holder broke but was promptly fixed. We didn't go to the restaurant, too expensive. Cafe de la Presse, recommended by one of the reviewer, is a nice spot for breakfast, or you can walk to the Ferry building marketplace.All in all, I might have given it 4 stars if we had really paid the average price listed here, but we paid only $144 a night through Expedia, and compared with other CA hotels where we stayed during this trip for similar price, Omni was clearly in a different league."
235,2131,"Apr 3 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed at the Omni for four nights and had a great experience. I was attending a business conference, but arrived a day early to see the sights. My husband also came along, and we both loved the service at the hotel. All members of the staff were very attentive and accommodating, from the doormen to the front desk to housekeeping. The room was clean and comfortable and very quiet - no problems with noise. I would definitely stay at the Omni again."
236,2131,"Apr 2 2008 	Comfortable Stay stay on a weekend!	The lobby is opulent and the staff were lovely. The bedroom was spacious and the decor is high end and not shabby but a little old fashioned. The bed was very comfortable and very quiet ensuring a good nights sleep. We stayed for four nights over a weekend period and when we asked about extending our stay for a further night (Tuesday night) we were disappointed to learn that the rate was double what we had paid for our previous four nights and resulted in us checking into another hotel in the San Francisco area. The buffet breakfast is expensive (breakfast for three cost 90). The bar is lovely and very well decorated and a little music would have created an ambience here. However, overlooking this we had a lovely stay in this hotel and would recommend it."
237,2131,"Mar 30 2008	Nice but....	We stayed at the Omni for two nights (3/20 &amp; 3/21) and were immediately impressed by the service upon our arrival. Also, the lobby of the hotel was magnificent. We had a Deluxe Room/Parking arrangement which was very economical ($200 per night plus Expedia fees which were a little high) and our request for a quiet room was certainly honored. The downsides: while the staff at the Omni is Excellent (with a capital e), it is obvious that they've been a victim of the &quot;more with less&quot; phenomenon currently plaguing the U.S. There was a false fire alarm which occurred which, while not they're fault, delayed our sightseeing as we had locked our camera in our room safe and the safe refused to open. When we informed the front desk, they assured us security would be up shortly. This took almost half an hour and two more calls. It would have been much better if we'd been kept advised as to the progress of security. More importantly, though, it would have been much better if there had been more than one security person available. This became a recurring theme of our stay. We had plumbing issues and it took, again, about half an hour for someone to come. I asked the front desk about whether one of our bags had arrived; they said they'd call me to advise me. When I never got a call, I had to call them again and inferred, from the desk clerk's apology, they'd forgotten to call me.Lastly, while our room was quiet, it was a bit run-down (carpet frayed/stained); is this how these &quot;discount&quot; rooms become available to the common masses?"
238,2131,"Mar 29 2008 	One Of the Best	Stayed here at the end of a long trip around the USA and have to say it was just wonderful. All the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the doorman and front desk staff - even when I forgot my room number! The bed was so comfortable and the room very high quality. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough for comfort and service, can't wait to go back."
239,2131,"Mar 23 2008 	Omni Hotel 500 California	Our family stayed at the Omni for our spring break this year which was March17th-21st. Great service, excellent location in San Francisco and a clean and wonderful room. Our kids, ages 11 and 7, loved the attention from the staff. We loved the location to all the attractions in San Francisco. I would highly recommend the Omni. Only down side was the water pressure in the shower."
240,2131,"Mar 22 2008 	loved the omni	We stayed at the Omni in December 2007. Overall it's a great location, the rooms and general decor in the hotel is of a high standard. The hotel staff are really helpful. The breakfast is very good and the bar in the hotel is popular and good value"
241,2131,"Mar 17 2008	Great place to give your car a chance to be stolen	The hotel may have received a top rating for service overall, but the front of the house service is sorely lacking, the doorman, the valet and bell service. One of the jobs is to keep the area in front of the hotel open for guests checking in. When we arrived the area was full of empty limos and service people not doing much of anything. We parked further up and had to walk back to get help with the car and it seemed like I was putting them out. The real problem occurred the next day when we leaving to go shopping to find the car at the curb, (furthest from the front door) unlocked with the keys in the visor and the only staff around was the doorman, who was busy on his cell phone, not paying much attention to anything. When asked, why my car was out there, he said &quot;I don't know, someone must have called for it&quot;. No one was concerned or seemed disturbed that my car was out front unlocked with the keys in it, not even the manager who was on duty at the time. I was told that they got the number wrong when someone else called down for their car, the radios have static. I was assured that there was no way that someone else could have taken my car, they check the numbers. The next day when I checked out, I called for the car, I gave them the number, no one asked my name, no one referred to me by name. When I went out front to retrieve my car the valet asked and pointed, &quot;Is that your car?&quot; He never asked my name or checked the number. Now, tell me, how safe to you feel leaving your car at the Omni in San Francisco? Do you feel lucky? My next trip will find me back at the Mark Hopkins."
242,2131,"Mar 17 2008 	Loved the Omni and SF!	This review is late in coming but as it was one year ago today that we were in SF for our anniversary it made me think of it. I LOVED the Omni (not super modern) and the service was excellent. They upgraded us to a top floor room, with rose petals and wash clothes in the shape of a heart for our anniversary with no charge. The only complaint was the kids in the room next door hanging out their window, smoking half the night. But that was not the Omni's fault. The door men were great and the location was convenient to most of what we wanted to see. Would definitely go back."
243,2131,"Mar 5 2008 	Omni-licious	We recently stayed for my young daughters birthday. I was a little nervous because I did not know how they would recieve a us since we had a young child. But that was allieviated when we entered the room and there was a chocolate cake , milk and a birthday card waiting for her. She was so excited!! From the time you walk in the staff is so welcoming and friendly. The room was clean, elegant ,quiet and comfortable. Room service was expensive but prompt and friendly. The beds were so comfortable we stayed in on a Friday night. The staff really do their best to accomodate your every night.Cons: The Wolfgang Puck coffee that is supplied in the room. You can avoid this by becoming a Select member.. and you will get free coffee and newspaper in the morning. This was an inside hint that I got on from this site.Suggestions: Would like them to give a little freebie like other hotels i.e. wine and cheese or continental breakfast.Overall I loved it and can't wait to go back."
244,2131,"Mar 3 2008 	Fantastic experience	I don't know where to begin. This hotel from start to finish was amazing. By far the best service I have ever experienced anywhere. The reservation process was smooth and easy and it just got better once we arrived. The staff at the Omni really goes that extra mile to impress their guests. It was my mom's 60th birthday and they had champagne and a lovely piece of cake waiting for us when we returned from our day in the city. The door man was so charming, he handed my mom a rose and told her happy birthday. The check in process was quick and efficient. We arrived early and had no problem getting our room. I requested the lowest floor available, the man at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. Our room was beautiful and comfortable. The beds are super soft and the bathroom was very nice as well (huge tub, nice bath products!). The hotel provided a black towncar to take us to dinner, the driver was helpful and also very nice. My only regret was that we only had one night at the Omni. I can't wait to return with my husband on our next trip to SF. We visit the city 3-4 times per year and the Omni is most definitely my favorite hotel ever. It is a very short walk to Union Square (about 10 minutes) and the cable cars run in front of this hotel. North Beach is also very close. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and would highly recommend staying here! It just goes to show you that there are still places out there that put the customer first and go that extra mile to make their guests happy. Bravo Omni.."
245,2131,"Feb 28 2008 	Nice place but no internet...	We had a great weekend getaway planned and were looking forward to our stay at the Omni. The valet parking is 51.00/day but we were directed to a garage up the street for a weekend rate of 7/day. Nice downtown location withing walking distance of shopping and dining. Lobby and restaurant were very nice. My wife's martini was $15 and my beer was about $7. Don't drink too much there. The room we had had a great king bed, super comfy. Old style TV set looked out of place but worked fine. Immaculate rooms and very nice appointments. We were disappointed that our in-room high speed internet did not work. Called customer support 2x but no dice. Mentioned it to the front desk people and they shrugged it off as no big deal and didn't offer to try to make it right for us. Needless to say we didn't get any work done in the evenings but I guess that it wasn't meant to be. So all in all we had a good time at an upscale hotel with crappy internet service."
246,2131,"Feb 25 2008 	Well run property	Spent a two night stay at the Omni San Francisco in January 2008. As a member of their frequent guest program I was sent a coupon for 1/2 off the weekend rate and was able to use it. The staff is excellent. From the on-the-spot front doormen to the absolutely perfect front desk clerk (Bridget? not sure but hope that's correct) I couldn't have been more impressed. Because it was our first stay at this property we were upgraded to a Signature room. The room was beautiful and spotless. Very upscale furnishings and fabrics. The Pecksniff's and Moulton Brown toiletries were much appreciated. Mornings we received complimentary coffee and fresh squeezed OJ delivered to the door along with a newspaper. That perk is yours if you sign up with Omni's frequent guest program online. Overall the hotel was in top notch condition and kept spotless. We enjoyed breakfast both mornings in the dining room. As it usually is with hotel dining rooms the prices were pretty steep for breakfast. However, it was convenient for us and worked out fine. Having lived in San Francisco I would say that the location is definitely geared to the business travelers. It is located in the financial district and is a short walk to the more touristy areas, such as Union Square. The Omni offered us complimentary town car service to Davies Symphony hall which was a very nice surprise! Overall we were treated very well. This was one of the finest properties we've stayed in and it's no surprise it's rated number one in San Francisco. Would return without hesitation."
247,2131,"Feb 16 2008 	Why I'll never stay at another Omni Hotel	Just a short note to explain to you why I will never stay in another Omni Hotel.I reserved a Signature Room at the Omni San Francisco Hotel through Hotels.com for 4 nights, arriving August 31 and leaving September 4, 2007.When I arrived at the hotel I was informed that they had over-booked their rooms. I was told that I would be put in a lower cost standard room, a room without the Signature Room complimentary services. Needless to say, I was not happy about paying the Signature price for the lower cost room, this because I had paid in advance.When I complained, I was offered a free breakfast. After I refused to accept the room they had offered, I was finally given a Signature Room. No doubt some other poor schmuck got stuck paying top dollar for a standard room. A first-class hotel would never have suggested downgrading a paying customer, regardless of how or how much they paid. But then, Omni isnt a first-class hotel.Once I had checked into my Signature accommodations, everything was fine except for one minor detail. On Monday morning, September 3, while entering the bathroom in my suite, I stepped on a carpet nail that was protruding upward out of the carpet in front of the bathroom door. I didnt think I needed to be concerned about walking barefoot in my own room, not in a first-class hotel.I wasnt as angry about being injured by Omnis negligence as I was by their response. When I contacted the front desk and explained that a nail had punctured my toe and that I was bleeding profusely, their staff offered me a band-aid. Given the fact that I was in pain and limping, given the fact that I now had to contact my doctor to find out when I last had a tetanus shot, given the fact that I now had to worry about catching some horrible disease from the last person who impaled themselves on their carpet nail - I would have expected a first-class hotel to be more consolatory than to offer me a band-aid.After I returned to my room, the Omni staff sent me a note stating that they were unable to find the nail that had injured me. They insisted that I point out the nail to their building engineer, which I did. As their building engineer was pounded the offending nail back into the floor, he stated that he discovered 2 more nails protruding upward out of the carpet in the same general area. I wasnt aware that I was entering a mine field when I checked into the Omni hotel.But the final straw occurred as I was checking out of the hotel. The desk clerk inquired as to my stay. I explained the whole sordid tale, the nail, the blood, the limping, everything. I then asked what was the best way to get to the Oakland Airport. To add insult to injury, she suggested that I walk 4 blocks to the BART station.Once I returned home, I contacted the Omni management to complain. The hotel manager promised to send me a voucher for several free nights stay. This never happened. A first-class hotel manager would have been a man of his word.But then, Omni isnt a first-class hotel."
248,2131,"Feb 9 2008	Nice hotel Annoying fees	I stayed here overnight on a quick business trip to San Francisco. The room and service were quite good.For tourists paying their own way, however, the extra fees are excessive. The business center is deficient, and the fees for using the computer and fax machine are high. Mini bar charges are also excessive. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was good but also overpriced -- $25 for a basic eggs, toast etc. As is usual with high-end hotels, the extra costs are excessive and annoying."
249,2131,"Feb 8 2008 	Great hotel with a luxurious feel - Not really for tourists	This property feels very luxurious, and the rates aren't bad either.Nice lobby, accomodating and friendly front desk staff. Rooms are very comfortable with soft beds and great bathroom amenities. The shower was great too (good water pressure, which I find is often a problem). Decor was classy.Windows in room don't keep out any street noise, but at least they opened to let some fresh air in. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to tourists - it's in the financial district and I found I needed to walk quite a bit to even find restaurants that were open for dinner past 7:00 PMI had trouble with the in-room internet - the hotel was not helpful. Other than that, I had a great stay."
250,2131,"Feb 4 2008	Absolutely Fantastic Stay	We checked in for a one night stay - the Front Desk staff was extremely accommodating and allowed us early check in (and late check out). The room was lovely and very comfortable. The Concierge was great! He recommended wonderful restaurants in the area for our lunch that day. We had an evening performance 6 blocks away (all up hill) and he arrranged a complimentary towncar ride to the event.The Omni has a computer room and allowed us to do electronic flight checkin and print our boarding pass at no charge.Our breakfast in the Hotel restaurant (Bob's Steak House) was fantastic with the service rated above a 10. An early dinner in the Bar prior to leaving for the airport was equally marvelous. Best steak I have ever had (albiet quite pricey). Worth every cent.I'd stay there again in a heartbeat and, in fact, may plan a trip back in the spring and will definietly stay at the Omni."
251,2131,"Jan 30 2008 	Beautiful/Quiet	The Omni Hotel is beautiful and quiet. Now this isn't the Four Seasons, but it is still along the same lines. Rooms were spacious and elegant and very comftoable and inviting. They even have turn down service in the evening, which is an added bonus. The best thing about this place was the gym. All I can say is awesome!!!! The lighting is great, the equipment was top notch, well taken care of by staff, stocked with towls, headphones, water, etc. AWESOME!Only drawback is that it is a little pricey to say the least. Items in room are a plenty, but it will cost you. My suggestion is to leave those kinds of things alone. LoL I would stay here again."
252,2131,"Jan 29 2008 	First Class Hotel	My wife and I got to escape our lives and children for one night thanks to Grandma. We decided to stay at tripadvisor's #1 pick. We agree. The Omni is truly remarkable. The hotel itself is beautiful. Our room was spectacular. The shower had two heads plus two coming off the wall. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the place was super clean. We got the California Suite / Sweet deal. They brought us amazing chocolates while we were napping. Then we showered and went out for dinner. When we came back, the bed was made and our used towels had already been replaced. They left even more chocolates by the bedside. I've never been treated so well and we stay at a lot of nice places. This place is top notch!"
253,2131,"Jan 28 2008 	Beautiful hotel	The Omni is a lovely hotel with exceptional service. We loved everything, down to the bath products, which I have been special ordering since our visit. The location is convenient- close to trolley lines and Chinatown, plus cabs are easily available in front of the hotel. At check in we were treated with kind attention and our 5 year old son appreciated the special kid's gift packet, full of goodies and activities. We also thought is was a nice touch to have milk and cookies brought to our room every afternoon (although a bit close to dinner time). Our only complaint is the lack of a pool, which nearly led us to another location. We chose to book at the Omni anyway, since it was the site of the meeting we were attending. Overall, it's a great hotel and they do their best to welcome young children."
254,2131,"Jan 28 2008 	They surpassed my expectations!	I wrote a review recently regarding my stay last year in September and as you can see, the experience was amazing. After such a great stay I knew that I had to come back to the Omni, and I am so glad that I did. Let me share my wonderful weekend with you.We came to celebrate my fiance's birthday. I made sure to let the Omni know during my reservations and when I spoke with the concierges to arrange for some cider to be sent up to the room. On our way to the hotel I realized we would like a DVD player in our room and when I talked with them I was informed that we wouldn't have to worry about asking for a DVD player because we had been upgraded to a suite (which included a DVD player)! The weather was pretty nasty the day we arrived, but we made it there (sopping wet, but still...). Greeted warmly by the door-man I got my keys and we headed to our suite. It was on the 7th floor, and at first I was disappointed because I had requested a high floor, until I opened the door to our room.The suites have a separate sitting room with a couch and two sitting chairs, as well as a desk and entertainment system set-up (I will post pictures shortly after the review is posted). The stereo was turned on, playing some soft classical music as we entered the room. The ambiance was magnificent. On the table were THREE separate greeting cards, wishing warm birthday wishes to my fiance', inviting us to ask for anything we need to be comfortable, as well as a personally written greeting card from the general manager! This is why the Omni San Francisco won top honors for best service in the United States! Within minutes of settling in there came another knock at the door. My fiance' and I were both surprised to see in-room dining had sent up a slice of chocolate birthday cake! It was very good and we were wondering if they planned to spoil us rotten all weekend. While there were no more additional amenities, the Omni, as always, was very fast and professional with any and all requests that I made. The night that we arrived, for example, I called the front desk to ask for recommendations for a good italian restaurant. The concierge I spoke to (Justin I believe was his name) was very friendly and recommended the North Beach restaurant/area, stating that there were numerous italian restaurants in the area that we could choose from. We took him up on it and sure enough we found a charming little place called Franchino's to have dinner. Our room also came with free breakfast each morning we were there. I've heard mixed reviews about the restaurant from other people, but I thought that the breakfast was very good. Granted that it came with my room and I didn't have to pay anything except for the tip. I'm not sure I would say the same if I actually paid the 25 dollars for the breakfast. Still, as an amenity to a hotel-room package, the breakfast is very good.If there was one thing that I had to say that was not the best experience during this last stay, it was that Cabs were hard to come by this time. I heard something about local taxi services boycotting the Omni, but I'm not sure if that was true or not. Whatever it was, many cabs dropped off their customers and just sped off rather than pick up people waiting in the cab line. So, my fiance' and I did a lot more walking than we probably planned to.Still, if you requested a copy of the 2007 rewards for hotels, you will see the Omni San Francisco won a number of honors. Ranking in at #34 worldwide in Luxury hotels, #3 in U.S Luxury Hotels, Best in the San Francisco Destination (of the top 25), #4 in World- Customer Service and #1 in U.S- Customer Service. That's not the chain, it's this branch! To any Omni San Francisco staff reading this review, thank you so much for making my stay so memorable and I can't wait to come back and visit you again.To anyone visiting San Francisco in the near future: Make your reservations! I can't stress enough how great this hotel is. Affordable luxury, amazing customer service and a great location makes the Omni San Francisco your best bet in this very large city.Happy travels!"
255,2131,"Jan 22 2008 	Very Good	I stayed here for two nights in Jan 08 on the way home from a business trip. The reception was excellent, rooms and bahrooms are very good indeed and all the staff set out to please. Its a bit away from the main tourist areas (Union Square and the Wharf) but thats no bad thing. Its a 10 min walk to Union Square, and approx a 30 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf through North Beach. Its also about 10 mins walk to the Ferry Builiding where you can pick up the F Line tram. The California line cable car stops outside the door so transport is not a problem if you don't want to walk. I booked through the hotel web site directly as this offered the best deal ($169 per night) I also ate at Bobs Steak and Chop House (the hotel restaurant) on the first night. Very good but not a cheap option (approx $70-$80 a head for two courses and a couple of drinks). San Francisco is a great city and I would certainly stay here again."
256,2131,"Jan 14 2008 	Nice place the Omni San Fransisco.	We did a 4 week tour of the USA over December/January 2007, with 3 older children (girl, 22, boy, 19 and boy, 18), going to San Francisco [Omni Hotel], Miami (South Beach) [Beacon Hotel], Orlando (Disneyworld, Pop Century Resort), Chicago [Drake Hotel], New York (for Christmas) [Beacon Hotel - unrelated to the Beacon in Miami], Boston [Omni Hotel], New York (again) [Roosevelt Hotel] (including New Years Eve at the Renaissance Hotel overlooking Times Square), and a day trip to Niagara Falls. It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids.Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. Ill mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. The Omni was arranged through a travel agent in Brisbane, though as usual I had checked with Trip Advisor, and then asked the travel agent to book it when I was satisfied. He got me better rates than going to the hotel direct, too. We were also staying at an Omni in Boston, and as I'd joined the Omni's Select Guest program (free, via the internet), there were advantages to be had. Plus, we'd previously stayed at the Omni in Washington and it was spectacular (my favourite of the 3 Omnis I've stayed in whilst in the USA), so we thought it would be good.We weren't disappointed. Fairly large rooms (we had a double and a triple, though the kids weren't particularly happy at 2 of them having to share a double bed - but then, they're not paying!); interconnecting which was useful. Free internet (I had a laptop) for Select Guest members (if you stay at the Omni, the Select Guest program is recommended - free juice/coffee and newspaper delivered every morning). Very reasonably sized bathroom. In all, very comfortable.It's a grand building with an impressive foyer. We received a lovely sincere welcome from the bell captain on arriving. The hotel is not all the conveniently located, but we were happy to walk and find our way around. Finding cheap restaurants (try feeding 5, including 2 big boys, for 4 weeks straight - you won't be eating at the hotel restaurants very much!) was a bit of a task, but not impossible. Speaking of meals, we fell over Francis Ford Coppola's Italian cafe in Kearney Street on the way back from climbing the Coit tower - it was great. Google it if you are interested. I brought some of the wine back to Australia. We decided to eat there purely on the basis of the menu and the look of the place, then found out who the famous owner was. Recommended purely on the Italian food and the venue, if nothing else.We did a tour of the city (booked through the travel agent), which was absolutely worthwhile. Stopped at good views of the city (from a high lookout), and another spot for views of the Golden Gate Bridge (which the bus drove over). It also included a harbour cruise from Pier 39 at Fisherman's Wharf, which went under the Golden Gate Bridge and circled Alcatraz Island. It's a good way to see the highlights.Our time at the Omni in San Francisco was good - nice rooms and ambience, but not budget accommodation."
257,2131,"Jan 8 2008	I Love This Hotel!!	This hotel &amp; its' staff gives hotels a good name. It is why i love hotels; the staff is friendly/helpful/courteous/kind (&amp; probably thrifty, brave, etc) from the desk staff to the concierge, bellmen, doormen &amp; maids. The lobby IS like walking into the Titanic (as noted in another review). There are milk &amp; EXCELLENT choc chip cookies left in your room each afternoon plus cider &amp; cookies in the lobby.The rooms are beautiful (in contrast to the Madonna Inn where we had just stayed for a night), the beds are comfy &amp; warm.The parking is EXPENSIVE, ($45/day, i think) but i got a deal on Expedia that INCLUDED parking for ~$10/day. The parking is a block or 2 away but only had to wait 5-10 minutes for the car to be brought around.The area has expensive restaurants (Tadich grill, cafe tiramisu) and less expensive ones (House of Nanking); a terrific place for breakfast is Cafe de la Presse a couple of blocks away--reminds me of Paris. You can walk to everything. I want to go again!"

You are also within in walking distance of Chinatown, and Union Square.The staff at this hotel are very attentive and make you feel special. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who can afford to stay here. Although even if you can afford to stay here, it can be competitive at times to find a vacancy.When I return to San Franscisco again in the near future I will definitley stay at the Omni again."

We were able to walk to North Beach for dinner.The rooms are spacious and well appointed with marble countertops and shower. Decorated with great taste throughout. The staff was attentive to details and housekeeping keeps the room absolutely impeccable.I highly recommend this hotel."
261,2131,"Dec 30 2007 	Great stay at the Omni	My fiance and I stayed at the Omni for 1 night. I found the cheapest rates on the Omni Hotel's website. Unfortunately nothing else was cheap. $45/night for parking with unlimited in and out privileges. $70 for a steak. $34 for 3 cocktails. $70 for 3 mediocre martinis and 2 appetizers. The onion rings were pretty bad. There is free wi-fi in the lobby, but $10 for an internet connection in your room. The hotel was beautifully decorated for the holidays. All of the staff were very nice and courteous when we arrived. Security was very helpful when my fiance got locked in the stairwell (you can get into the stairwell, but you need a key to get onto the floors). There was complimentary hot cider and cookies for the guests in the lobby. I especially liked the gingerbread men. The rooms were very nice and spacious (for SF) with marble countertops and high thread count bedding. I loved their bathrobes. When we went back to our room at the end of the night the maid wrote a welcome note and left mint chocolates on the nightstand. The hotel is located in the Financial district so lots of people go to the lobby bar after work. It's a few blocks from Union Square so we took a cab to get around town. I would have given the Omni 5 stars but some of the rates for food were ridiculous and the maids knocked on our door 4 times to clean the room."
