131,275,"Nov 2 2005	Good Hotel for Happy People	Recently stayed 4 nights at the Alexis Park Hotel ($75/night, try and get a suite for that price in Sin City). The hotel is directly across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel which is always fun to run into the musically inclined. We stayed in a standard Monarch Suite that has a large sitting area (living room) connected to the sleeping area. The space is nice to have people over, just make sure you pick up after yourself if you don't want your friends to see your unmentionables. Wet bar and fridge are good to keep snacks and cold drinks. Bed was a bit uncomfortable due to lack of padding. Electrical plug in the bathroom didn't work. The entire hotel complex is undergoing renovation, but we weren't bothered by it. If you don't need pampering and just want a good room at a great price then check out the Alexis Park."
132,275,"Oct 31 2005	Bad disgusting never again!	I wish I had read reviews about the Alexis Park *before* booking.The place has a fabulous lobby and looks nice from the outside, but the rooms were atrocious. The first room we were given wasn't made up, smelled horrible, and there was a lot of dried blood on one of the pillows. We demanded another room, and were given one in much better condition, though the bed was squeaky, there were gaps in some of the multihued bathroom tilework, mystery stains on the sofa, and one dead cockroach. On the plus side, it looked like the exterior had been recently painted and the pool areas looked clean.All this for $180 a night.This establishment advertises itself as a &quot;resort&quot; but should really be your last resort."
133,275,Oct 30 2005	The Alexis Park is always fantastic	Two weeks ago my family had a huge birthday party for my cousin and I have to say that my experience at The ALEXIS was great. The front desk people have always been professional and prompt. The pools look good and parking is always available. The rooms are big. It is like staying at an apartment. I visit Vegas about five times each year and I have always enjoyed my stay there. It is the only place I will stay at.
134,275,"Oct 25 2005 	Don't stay at Alexis!	I stayed at the Alexis for a conference last week. What a disaster! The entire resort is just *tired* -- looks like a 70s style motel that's been cheaply renovated. They're halfway done repainting the motel buildings into a terra cotta stucco faux finish, but it looks &quot;faux&quot; and the colors from building to building don't match. The rooms were rehabbed, yet outdated. Some of the entryway tiles in my room were cracked and replaced with mismatched tiles. Other tiles were loose and would move when I stepped on them. The tiles around the shower were also &quot;peeling&quot; -- i didn't think that tiles peeled, but I never stayed at the Alexis before either - you learn something new everyday! :) Also, the remote controls for the TVs didn't work and one of the lightbulbs in one of the lamps were burnt out when I arrived. The worst part of my stay was when the water main broke and there was no hot water in the entire resort. It was the same day as my checkout and I would expect that one member of the staff would apologize and/or ask me how my stay was -- nope -- the front desk just handed me a receipt, no questions asked or apologies given for the water problem.This is definitely NOT a resort, it's an over-sized motel."
135,275,Oct 25 2005	Great hotel great value	My family and I enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We drove all the way from Wyoming for my wife's sisters wedding. I was very glad to have been able to park our family van right by our hotel room. The room was much bigger than we expected and since we arrived ahead of schedule the font desk was very accomodating about checking us in a little early. One gal at the front desk (cant remember her name) was helpful in recommending where we should take our children for some fun.I would like to thank the entire staff ESPECIALLY the housekeeper who kept our room so tidy.
136,275,Oct 21 2005	Great Stay-Great Rate	We spent three nights at the Alexis Park Resort and we had such a good time. The front desk agents were so accomodating and our room was so much nicer than what we had expected for the rate we paid. Every one of the employees we encountered were so friendly and replied to our requests promptly. We will definitely return to this hotel!
137,275,"Sep 25 2005	Disorganized so not a resort!	After reading all the reviews, I was skeptical about staying her. Mainly, for the bad reviews regarding the cleansiness of this hotel. However, this hotels biggest issue is a disorganized front desk. Since, we were on a budget for our wedding, we decided to give it a try anyway. Upon checking in, we were given a Queen Suite, after reserving a Loft Suite. After, spending 45 minutes trying to straighten this out, the person at the front desk tried to charge us for the room we didn't even check into. To make matters worse, our card, which we held the reservation with, was charged for the stay. Even though we paid cash for both the stay an incidentals, prior to arriving. When we discussed the matter with the front desk, they said no charges were placed on our card. We had to call the credit card company, while at the front desk. The card company had to tell them, &quot;yes, this card was charged by your hotel&quot;. As for the room. Once, we received the right one, it was clean and comfortable, except for the upstairs shower. It had severe mildew, and we actually had to buy cleaner to get it clean enough, for us to feel comfortable to take a shower. Overall, if I was on a budget when visiting Vegas again, I would look elsewhere, and only stay here as a last resort. By, the way, still waiting for the credit on our card to appear!"
138,275,Sep 22 2005	Not what it seems	More like a dorm. The rooms do have a fridge and a sofa but beware that &quot;two beds&quot; might mean one bed and a sofa bed.
139,275,"Sep 18 2005	Not a resort	This hotel had bad service in all areas except the housekeeping was decent. This place looks great from the website photos (which must be at least 10-years old) but look at the other reviewers photos that show how truly shabby this place is. Paint and plaster are peeling off the buildings around the pool area and the interior of our suite was very cheap quaility (plastic tub) with very poor finish work. There even was a hazardous, sharp piece of metal sticking up from the floor where a doorstop had broken off, the floor tile was cracked with chunks missing, and we had a room in the &quot;refurbished&quot; wing! The location was bad with lots of construction going on Harmon Road. We love to walk everywhere but it was very unpleasant to walk to nearby areas from this location with too much traffic and poorly lit street and sidewalks. If you have time to watch TV, forget about it. Channel selection and reception were both poor.We had ants in the bathroom and the air conditioner was horrible. The first night we'd go from sweating to freezing, with no happy medium. A little sign on the thermostat said not to set below 70 or the unit would freeze. We turned it down as low as possible and by the 3rd night, the AC unit next to our bed was dripping water all night with a water torture effect. I only got some sleep after using ear plugs. Someone was sent to fix it and all they did was turn the thermostat back up! On the same day, our electronic key stopped working, which made another extremely long wait in line in the lobby a necessity. As it turned out, they had us checked out of our room 2 days early! Another guest in line ahead of us, said it was his 3rd attempt to get checked into a room and one time, they actually put him in a room that was already occupied - it wasn't our room either, so they must routinely &quot;accidently&quot; check guests out of their rooms prematurely. The front desk service was extremely slow and each visit required a very long wait in line with other disgruntled guests. The thing that really ticked me off was their internet service. I signed up for a full day at 10 a.m., only to later learn the cut-off time is at noon! So, I had paid $10 for full day service for only 2 hours of actual service. After calling the front desk twice, they finally said they would reverse the charge. I later overheard another guest asking for a refund for the same reason, so this too must be an ongoing problem. After we checked out, I called the front desk and they confirmed that no extra charges were incurred on our account, only to later see that darn $10 charge show up on my credit card bill a month later. That really ticks me off because it is hardly worth my time to fight a $10 charge and they know it.This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. If you are considering a stay at the Alexis &quot;Resort,&quot; save your time, money, and peace of mind by staying elsewhere. It is NOT worth the savings you may think they are offering."
140,275,"Aug 14 2005	A home away from home	I booked my stay at the Alexis Park Resort while I was attending to a convention. I got a great deal when I booked my stay in advance. When I arrived to check in at the front desk, I only waited about five minutes before they served me. I asked if I can check in early and they checked me in quickly. They were very accommodating. The staff and security were friendly and very professional. The room I was assigned, was very nice, spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable too. The room had a living room area and a kitchen bar. Plus internet access (for an extra charge). Room service was good and they made my bed and restocked the towels twice in one day. I will defiantly book my stay again. It was like a home away from home."
141,275,"Aug 5 2005	Nice but with some problems	We checked in quite late and were greeted at the reception by a rather abrubt, unfriendly receptionist who seemed to take forever checking us in. When we checked out, the service was no better. A different man at reception arrogantly said that the room would be charged to my credit card, and then when I said I had already paid for it through expedia, he just snapped at me at said, 'ok, fine', then moved on to the next customer. No apologies or nothing. Of course, when I got home, I glanced at my credit card statement and noted that I have indeed been charged for the room! What a joke. So, I now have to contact expedia and inform them so I can receive a refund. On a more positive note, the rooms are quite cheap. We stayed in a bungalow and it was lovely, spacious with a nice jacuzzi half way up the stairs. Criticism time again - the air conditioning was inadequate in the room. It wasn't even cool in our room, and bearing in mind 115 fahrenheit temperatures, you kinda need good air-conditioning. Also, our room was round the back of the building and faced a waste ground or something (cant remember exactly what). However, the breakfast was lovely, and inexpensive. The hotel offers free parking which is good and it is in a nice location, close to the strip, yet in a quiet position considering proximity. Again, another criticism is that, for some reason an outside attendant constantly felt the need to whistle loudly (to call in taxis I think), so I would pity anyone whose room was near the reception area as that would be all you would hear all night long! Yes, so overall review is good and bad. I would probably stay there again if only for the lovely bungalow."
142,275,"Jul 27 2005	you get what you pay for	After refusing to pay $300 a night for hotels on the Strip during Memorial Weekend I opted for this &quot;resort.&quot; I definitely do not think that resort is an accurate way to describe this place, it reminded more of an apartment complex. I had not done my research on trip advisor prior to going so I was not sure what to expect. I must say that had I read the reviews beforehand I would not have stayed here. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised. Check-in was quick and easy.The room was very big and looked like it was newly remodeled. Overall it was clean enough, I did not notice any stains on carpet, towels or sheets and I felt comfortable walking around barefoot. I am somewhat of a neat freak so this is a big deal to me. We did have a problem with housekeeping in that we left the room late afternoon and came back that night to find that our room had not been cleaned. We were only able to get clean towels after calling the front desk but room could not be cleaned as housekeeping staff had left for the day. the next day we made sure to call housekeeping prior to leaving for the day and thus ensured that our room was clean once we returned. The location is far off the strip but close to Hard Rock. I did not notice the airport noise but that is probably due to alcohol consumption....if you are a light sleeper the airport is definitely close by."
143,275,"Jul 27 2005	Don't Sweat the Small Stuff	If your the kind of traveler that needs alot of personal attention from hotel staff, this is not for you....If you want to stay some place economical and well located consider this place...Had the crown loft great space...The entrance to the hotel is misleading...the front of property does not look like the rest of the hotel. Renovations seem forever on-going, but after a few days you think they may be finished. Large pool not open. A/C wall units (3 in all) had some leaking problems and noisy. Front desk are not quick to the phones. Some no answer at all or busy signal. Room was clean, well stocked, furniture and room was in good condition and very spacious. Spa tub was nice. Would stay again, just keep your needs in prespective."
144,275,"Jul 20 2005	Bad Experience	My flight to vegas got cancelled, and they refused to refund me my money (prepaid), whereas circus circus did. Its off the strip and there are better places on the strip, or off."
145,275,Jul 14 2005	I had a great time at the hotel	My friends and I went to Alexis Park in Vegas for my friends birthday. I was very happy with our room. It was big enough for my friends and I have a plenty of room. It was (4) girls so you know we needed plenty of room. THe staff was pleasant and the grounds were well kept. During my stay I even saw a beautiful outdoor wedding. THe hotel had done a really nice job. Overall my stay was excellent and I would go back again.
146,275,"Jun 9 2005 	Worst hotel ever	I stayed at the Alexis Park in Vegas recently. The hotel is in very bad shape. I was supposed to stay 4 nights, but left after 2. On the first night, the air conditioner broke. So they moved me to a room that had dead bugs laying on the bathroom floor and ants crawling all over the bathroom sink. It was disgusting and I highly recommend staying anywhere else. The website made the hotel look great, but it was a different story once I got there. Stay Away!!!!!"
147,275,"Jun 3 2005 	Alexis Resort Problems	1) TV sets (approx 30&quot; x 30&quot;) in Alexis Park hotel rooms - were not secured, or bolted down. Could be a hazard. 2) Bathtub/shower unit did not have slip resistant bath mat or other slip prevention device. After housekeeping cleans tub unit - surface is very slippery - could be hazard to children or adults. No hand rail in tub area for elderly guests. Also, there is no bathroom fan.3) Pool, contaminated and closed for several days. Notices appear to be from the local health department. This situation continued for several days -without full disclosure from staff.4) Air conditioning did not work in all Alexis Park units. Fellow traveler had a room without air conditioning while temperatures exceeded 100 degrees. The windows do not have screens or security devices.5) Full Disclosure of Hotel Charges (no room document/staff untrained) The phone lines were often busy - I was unable to get an outside line for up to an hour. Not good in the event of an emergency. Room service charges a mandatory 18% that is not disclosed on room menu. Internet is available for $12.95 per day. (At time of booking room - I understood it was free.)6) Mini kitchen (small sink, refrigerator, 2 drawers and 2 good sized cupboads, bar with 2 bar stools) is not fully functional for guests. The refrigerator temperature is set too high - and food freezes. Turning down the temperature, caused refrigerator odor. The room we rented had a queen bed and a couch/bed. The room could sleep 3-4 people - but the coffee maker was a single serve - for 1 person. No can opener, no microwave oven (to warm tepid room service meals), no toaster, and no dishes or silverware. Hotel staff did not have dish cloths or dish towels. I have rented several hotels along the WA and OR coast with a mini kitchen - and ALL have a few dishes, a few pieces of silverware, hand can openers (dish cloths and dish towels) and a microwave oven. 7. Movie selection - is not current. TV programs: NBC, Fox, ABC, (Alexis Resort Personal Billing channel - that never had an accurate billing posted for my room, Station/Computer program - non functional),ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN News, CNN, Headline News, Cartoon Network, Weather Channel, Las Vegas channel - non functional, TBS. NO PREMIUM CHANNELS.8) No Shuttle service to the strip or to the airport. From Alexis Park to the strip - is a very hazardous section of roadway. Cars and taxis are going from 45- 60 mph and make quick entrances into and out of properties along Harmon Ave. There is a sidewalk. Staff will tell you that the Hard Rock Hotel - across the street has a shuttle (to Las Vegas Ave) every hour on the hour. The Hard Rock shuttle does not charge for the service. 9) Alexis Park room amenities: Iron/ironing board, 5 hangers, queen bed (springs were terribly noisy), 3 drawer chest of drawers, 2 nightstands, couch/bed chair, 2 bar stools, small mini kitchen with single serve coffee maker and 2 coffee packets/2 condiment packets. Several towels were dingy and some had terrible stains, stains on the sheets as well. Laundry staff may not be using bleach for the laundry. No care is taken to provide clean looking towels and sheets.10) There was plenty of hot water for 2 nice long showers daily - and the hotel room was clean. My room had 4 sprinklers - and a working smoke alarm.11) Room keys stop working after 7 days. At the end of 7 days, the room key did not work. Staff did not alert guest to this standard issue at time of entry to hotel. Nor did staff member apologize for the inconvenience to guest. Front desk staff, not courteous to guests - a lack of common courtesy appeared to be standardThe stay at the Alexis was for business. It is known that several business associates stayed one night - and found better/less expensive housing in Las Vegas. For the record"
148,275,"May 28 2005 	Never Again	I would rather sleep at a truck stop, the help would certainly be friendlier.After arriving at 4:00 I found a check-in line 15 people long and only two people working the front desk. After the 45 minute wait to actually talk to the desk staff, I was told that my reservation had been cancelled. At that point, the desk staf was simply done talking to me. &quot;Call Orbitz&quot; I was told while they called the next victim in line.Orbitz did fix my reservation, which was entirely a hotel problem and I was checked in. Luckily, my room was clean and remodeled. Other guests attending the convention I was with were not so lucky.The main pool and hot tub were condemmed by the county health department. The third floor open air patio over the convention center hadn't been cleaned since what looked like a new years eave party. The bar was horribly dark and smelled of 20 years of smoke and spilled drinks.I had a bit of trouble with the $10 / day high speed internet access in my room and called for help. After prommising to have the technician there as soon as possible, I was lucky to figure it out myself after waiting 6 hours.If you used the second pool you had to share it with ducks each evening.On Friday evening, every teeny bopper in town showed up to share a room and hang out by the pool, right outside my front door... there must have been twelve 20 year olds sharing one room.Room service trays stayed in the halls all afternoon.The ONLY saving grace for this place was my 700 square foot remodeled room. I would never stay there again if given a choice."
149,275,"May 28 2005	Great room decent price unique gem of a hotel	Well, I just got back from my most recent trip to Las Vegas. I stayed in four different hotels and had four totally different experiences. This hotel started off very very negative in that the line to check in was a monster and there was one check in girl who barely spoke english. The manager did come out to help and that moved things along. From an organization standpoint this place gets one star. That said let me tell you why I rated this four stars. First let me say there is no casino on property which is good. The place is super quiet and the rooms are nice nice nice. I stayed in the Crown suite and only paid $115.00 per night. A great bargain for a room that is two floors two bathrooms and a king sized bed. It even had a hot tub in the stairs very cool. I would highly recommend this place for a honeymoon couple that does not want the distraction of heavy casino traffic. You still getr great views of the strip. I cannot give this five stars only because I stayed at the Bellagio this trip and it is now my worldwide standard bearer for hotel rooms. This far exceeds the Aladdin which was my previous favorite but not a good as the Bellagio. I recommend highly. Feel free to e-mail me with any questions"
150,275,"Apr 30 2005 	Not really great but the pools open 24 hours.	We stayed here for a convention that was happening at the Alexis Park resort in August 2003. We ended up having to stay in the farthest section of the hotel, all the way in the back. At least we had a car and we could drive over there with our luggage. The room was average. It was a suite with a pull out bed. If I recall there was a kitchenette. One thing that turned me off was the shoddy cleaning job that housekeeping did. I remember walking around with socks after they had cleaned and then looked at my socks and they were black. I don't think they ever mop up the floors in the kitchen or bathroom. Not to mention I could tell they didn't vacuum. The only thing that I enjoyed about the Alexis Park was that the swimming pools (there's 3) are not monitored and you can swim in them at any hour of the day. We were at the farthest so farthest from the lobby and hotel staff could not hear or see us. We would go swimming and sit in the hot tub late at night after we can home from partying. That was really fun. Especially since the water was so warm from the hot August days. I wouldn't really go back except for the swimming situation."
151,275,"Apr 15 2005 	Long lines at checkin	I booked over the internet and got a really good deal but learned a good leason....you only get what you pay for in life! The lines at check in were long, which i guess is normal for Vegas but to top it off the front desk clerks were so rude! They did not even apologize for the delay and really need a leason in customer service. The room was OK ( i liked the coffee pot) but housekeeping was not good-stained sheets, and they did not empty my trash. In fact, the garbage can did not even have a liner. The only good thing about the hotel (or should I say resort?) was the food-fabulous. By the way, where are the villas they are talking about?"
152,275,"Apr 9 2005 	Only if there's a conference...or an amazing deal	The only reason why I stay here is because of DefCon, a 3 day binge-drinking-war-driving-goon-dodging-sleep-oppressing debauchery of a weekend. Being that DefCon is the only source of revenue for this hotel; they charge $159 a night for a basic room, which likely goes for $70 any other day. Be aware that some of the entry level rooms lack a wall between the bedroom and sitting area. This didn't matter for my party, we still got loads of space, but the wide open space was such a waste. Actually, the wide open space was useful for housing a herd of underprivileged and malnourished hackers who came to Vegas with nothing more than their Bluetooth converters. For conventions/parties, the setting is great. 2 storey complexes centred around several pools, lush landscapes, fabulous lighting, and all in the middle of the desert! Directly outside my room was a wicked party at 0300hrs. The impressive grounds make this place a little bit above a consummate dive.The rooms are nothing to run home screaming about. Simple bed. TV with limited channels (not that it mattered for the weekend I was there), bathroom with a plastic tub and a bloody LOW FLOW shower head. The kitchen thing was nice, you can jump on the CAT, ride down to wal-mart, and get yourself milk, cereal, red bull, vodka and such, and all have it stored in your fridge to save yourself from the, um, food that they have for sale. Interior decorating is nice. Desert colours. Nice track lighting above the &quot;kitchen&quot;, overstuffed couches, generally, a nice room to crash in. The air conditioning units work a little bit too well for my wussy Canadian body. I'm still amazed that those freakin' things can freeze your hands like its winter.Security guys were funny. Daft, as they kept disturbing sunbathers to ask if they were ok. Yet again, this was at 0800 on Sunday after a HUGE party, and they were likely concerned about people lying on their back after enjoying a few. Sort of scary those guys have had guns. Maybe it's because I'm Canadian.At the end of the conference, on Sunday at like 1500hrs, the resort was desolate with the exception of a few families checking in. I felt bad for them. Only stay at the AP if you're present for a conference (ON SITE) or you're in Vegas for a reason other than gambling and getting wasted. If you want quiet or something for the family, I recommend staying at the Westin which is a block north.I'll definitely return...for def con 13."
153,275,"Mar 28 2005	Nice Quiet close to strip.	I just stayed here for 4 nights and I was satisfied. If you want a quiet place to retreat too after your time on the strip this place is great. If youre looking for entertainment around your hotel, don't stay here. Our suite was nicely furnished and very spacious. The staff was nice and we never had any lines at check in/out. It was a little cold to go swimming, but they said one pool was heated, but we couldnt find it. We were at the casino's so much we didn't have time to swim. We had breakfast twice at Lucky's in the Hard Rock (right across the street), it was really good! Also you can ride the Hard Rock's shuttle to the Strip. It runs every hour (10am to 7pm) from the Hard Rock; just ask the Valet where to pick it up.Overall for the money we paid we were satisfied and would recommend this hotel to people who want a quiet place without the frills. Its just a nicely furnished, spacious, clean place to lay your head at night.They are doing construction to the landscaping, driveway entrance, and front door entrance but that didn't bother us. The lobby has rendering posters up for future remodeling, but that hasn't started yet"
154,275,"Mar 26 2005	Good If you can't get a room anywhere else	I stayed here 3/20-3/23 as a last minute trip to Vegas. It was a bad week to stay because of NCAA Tourney, Spring Break, and Conventions. Everywhere on the strip was ridicousely priced (excalibur was $190 USD a night, MGM was $300 a night), so it was either the crudey airport hotels (see reviews),downtown (seedy) or the Alexis Park Resort. I came across Alexis Park Resort on TripAdvisor and saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. I got a room from i4vegas for $80 USD a night, a good rate for that week.Yes, it is going through a major overhaul, the lobby is coming along and you can tell it is going to be nice. I wasn't lucky enough to get a remodeled room, but the one I got wasn't bad. The Room was very clean and large (calling the room a suite is an overstatement, its more like a very big room). The TV got Very Poor reception, but you do get free webTV. The Shower head is very low for some odd reason, so if you are tall its going to be tought to take a shower. If you go out late like I do (I dont usually dont get back to my room until about 5:00AM), be aware they do not have 24 hour maid service, their maids go home a 4:00PM, I found this out the hard way, so I couldnt get my room cleaned the second day I was there, but they did provide me with some clean towels. The place is a little dark, buy hopefully the upgrades will solve that. There are a few stray cats that hang around the grounds ( I also noticed some feeding bowls for them, so they will not be going away anytime soon). Parking is very convienent and is across the street from the Hard Rock. Check-out could only be done at the front desk which kinda stinks. All in all, the place is good to get some sleep, its close to the strip (about 1 mile), rooms are clean, and its not in a bad area. I would stay there again if I had too because it is clean and it does seem safe, but I think I would wait until the remodeling is done, which doesnt seem like its going to be done for a good few months."
155,275,"Mar 21 2005 	Motel anywhere USA - not for Vegas fun!	Hated this place - it's poorly lit (in Vegas, go figure!). Even local cabbies - if you could get one - couldn't find the place in the dark. The tremendous road construction made the hotel nearly impossible to get in and out - forget trying to walk anywhere without risking your life. The suite is a nice concept, but pointless unless you plan to hang around your room. We never used the living area. One phone was broken; one tv barely functioned. We could never get regular coffee for the cup-at-a-time coffee maker. One day, they left all decaf. The &quot;bellboys&quot; are a joke - who needs your bags unloaded (first tip) when you can drive them to your room yourself? Expect to pay a second tip when a different eager bellboy delivers the bags to your room. There are no vending machines except soda and ice cream, so bring your own snacks, and we had to wait forever to attempt to get breakfast in the restaurant. The &quot;kitchen&quot; has a small refrigerator, but nothing more. Cabinet space, but nothing to put in them. Even the trash cans never got liners. Pools are pretty, but good luck finding the spa.Would not ever stay here again or recommend it."
156,275,Mar 11 2005	What a Peaceful Place	I have stayed at many Hotels in Las Vegas with gaming. The 24/7 action made me feel tension and stress. Always on the go. I stayed at the Alexis Park and it was wonderful. With the non-gaming resort I could have both worlds. The beautiful and mature landscape made me relax. I could not believe the rooms. They were all suites. The suite had everything. It was clean and comfortable with (3) pools for me to enjoy. I look forward to staying there again.
157,275,"Feb 26 2005	Large rooms great value!	I thought this hotel was a great value, paid $89 for a spacious suite. Fast check-in and quiet environment, unlike the casino's. But close enough to the strip, which they provided free shuttle to. Our room was clean and everything was in working order. Under renovations, but it looks like it will be gorgeous when it's done. I'll be back!"
158,275,"Feb 23 2005 	Nice!	I'm surprised at all the bad things that I've heard, but I don't know what you'll have seen or experienced. It was an excellent stay for me and my wife. Great personnel, great food, great service! Definitley cheaper than other 4 star hotels (yep, they are 4 stars in my opinion)."
159,275,"Feb 6 2005 	Here's a good review.	After reading all the trash reviews, I thought I would add my positive comments. The front desk personnel were very helpful. I had a miscommunication on my reservation about the type of room I reserved which they quickly corrected with little fuss. My room had been totally renovated (in building 23) and was very clean. My only complaints are: a minor squeak in the air conditioner, the fireplace didn't work (I assume it was turned off for safety reasons, but then why was it advertised?), and several machines in the workout room were old and in poor repair.Good points: Good housekeeping. Comfortable bed. Huge whirlpool tub. Clean furniture. Good soundproofing kept down airplane noise from nearby airport. Very adequate business center for checking emails, etc. Nice landscaping where it had been redone. For the money, much better than some of the other 3 star rated places I have stayed at in Vegas. I will stay there again."
160,275,"Feb 3 2005 	Don't even think about it	This property is definitely not a 3 star hotel. I got my reservations blindly through Hotwire. DO-NOT-DO-THIS! Prior to the purchase of my reservation, I had a phone conversation with a Hotwire Representative. The examples of 3 star hotels in the area given to me, included hotels like the LaQuinta &amp; the Marriott. What I got was The Alexis Park Resort. It looks VERY good in published photos. However it is currently under going a major restoration and as of this date, is far below the level of Motel 6.I had asked for a room that had been renovated. I was given a room that had several new items to include a brand new refrigerator &amp; bathroom fixtures. However the rest of the room, especially the bed and heater/air conditioner, were very old &amp; in dire need of replacement. The bed was rock hard &amp; squeaked loud enough to wake me when I would roll over in the night. The air conditioner/heater put out a musty smell when operating &amp; was so loud I had to turn it off to get to sleep.There's no exhaust fan in the bath room, only a small window. As far as the remodeling....they are painting the place RED. Kinda looks like the entrance to Hell. In my opinion it was poor value &amp; any Motel 6 would have provided more sleeping comfort!Just pass on this Hotel &amp; Hotwire as well because after repeated emails they still say...&quot;We have conducted a review of this property and have concluded that our star rating is accurate, and we do stand by that rating&quot;Do yourself a BIG favor &amp; look elsewhere."
161,275,"Jan 23 2005	It wasn't five star...	We found the room to be spacious and clean. When we arrived there is construction, the staff was friendly and helpful. The first room we were given was not made up, we were given another room with no problem.The room was very large, the beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms were both clean. Plenty of towels.The fireplace didn't work, which would have been nice. If you left food on the counter there were ants. But the room was not expensive and just the amount of space you had was worth it."
162,275,"Jan 7 2005	I have Stayed in Worse	I got the Alexis Park for New Years Eve after a bid on Priceline. I read the reveiws on here and was really scared. The front entrance still has some construction, but its not that bad. The lobby was very nice and my desk clerk was polite. I got a basic two room so-called suite. The outside of the building looks very old, but they are repainting and it makes it looks quite a bit better, but you can still tell that its old. The room I was in was recently renovated. They did an ok job, but cut so many corners that would not have cost that much more to do right the first time. They put a beautiful granite top on the bar... put they used the old painted 100 times wood bar frame below and hack cut the fridge in it. The interior doors are all old and should have been replaced. The lighting is very bad in the room. They have a sprinkler system and the sprinkler heads are hanging down about 1 1/2 inches. They should have some kind of covering around them to make a nice finished look. The bed was kind of hard, but the sheets were clean. Bathroom was fairly clean, but felt dirty because of the very poor lighting. I would stay here again if I got the place for dirt cheap and I could not get anything else in Vegas. Book Somewhere else like Palace Station or Las Vegas Club if you want a cheap room."
163,275,"Dec 10 2004 	Worst stay ever!!!!!	Booked this hotel hoping to find a nice non-gaming hotel close to a conference I was attending. Got to the hotel and wasn't sure if it was open or not. Could not even walk on the sidewalk to get into the front desk because of construction. It was late, I got my room and went to go and find it and was nervous because there was tons of plastic and caution tape covering the walkways and no lighting. Finally found it and opened the door to a nasty smell. The kitchen fridge was making loud noises as if it were going to explode. My room was freezing so I tried to turn the heat on or at a minimum the airconditioner off and the second I turned a button the cooler made a loud noise and started dripping water onto the t.v. set under it. After I grabbed towels to dry it off I sat down on the dirty couch to turn on the t.v. and the t.v. didn't work. I then decided I'd try and take a warm shower and the shower was filthy. I went to plop down on the bed and hit the bed as if I landed on concrete. Layed down to try and sleep and the thunder of airplanes flying over were so loud my room shook. Management and the owners of this location should close this hotel down! If you are making improvements good, but don't try and misrepresent the hotel and charge outragious prices for a complete dump and dangerous nights stay! I will never stay at this location or recommend anyone else to stay no matter how the improvements go. Do NOT BELIEVE THE PICTURES YOU SEE WHEN YOU RESEARCHING THIS HOTEL. IT IS A COMPLETE DIVE!!!!!!"
164,275,"Nov 28 2004	Nightmare Stay Away!	Stay away from Alexis Park!My family encountered the following problems during our 6 day stay:No hot water for showers, two mornings.Squeaky heating/cooling unit, woke everyone up at 5:00 am, took two days to repair.Shower Door fell off, was never fixed correctly.No sheets on downstairs bed on arrival.Fireplace did not work.Light outside the front door, was burned out, like many other rooms.Bad cable T.V. reception.Annoying perfume like smell in room.Right next to L.V. airport, you can clearly hear the planes taking off and landing.Many areas under construction, including front entrance.Outside Hot Tub was shut down and drained, during the last two days of stay.Uncomfortable beds.The Manager, Linda Hutchison was rude and very hard to contact.Linda has very poor people skills and did not seem to be very concerned about all the problems.To be fair, most of the other people working at Alexis Park, were nice and professional.To summarize:The Alexis Park Resort is a very poorly managed and maintained Hotel.Our stay was extremely stressful and unsatisfactory. Do yourself a favor and stay away, It is by far the worst place I have ever stayed at."
165,275,"Nov 9 2004	Worst place in Vegas!	Do yourself a favor and stay anywhere but here! The rooms are dirty, the service poor, the grounds dark. No security, front desk staff will give your room number to anyone who asks. Also, you will hear planes flying very low overhead all day. We had no hot water the one day we were here. Was there for a conference and a large group of people just checked out. Not worth the money or pain of staying here."
166,275,"Nov 8 2004	The Worst Ever	This was the worst place I have ever stayed. They overbooked and bumped me. The suite I thought was going to be great, &quot;when I got in it the following night&quot;, was run down, the windows all had plastic over them so I had no view or light and the Manager left much to be desired. Be very careful in your travel plans and do not stay there."
167,275,"Nov 7 2004 	Only if the sidewalk is too cold...	I stayed at the Alexis for the SEMA trade show. Totally misrepresented. Overpriced.Paid $92 per night on Hotwire. Front entrance is all torn up with construction, lobby is tired and unkept. Service is likely weary of handling all the complaints. Indifferent desk staff. Room was dirty, had footprints on tile, carpet dirty and unraveling, bathroom had hair and dirt in corners, Internet modem was missing, nice man came to fix it and all that did was charge my room for the service and never worked. Neither did net in Business Center (a closet with 2 pcs and a printer) Complaints were handled by a somewhat helpful desk manager, Linda, who found another room the next day, which was much cleaner but I believe it was done to quiet me down.This room was better but far below par and none of the property was as described. Internet required a jumper cable, they said I could buy it from the desk for $10. Fat chance. Pool area was torn apart and exterior was being painted.Beds were horrible, springs pressing into your back all night, reservation was wrong.Hotwire seemed concerned about the complaint and is investigating the hotel.To add insult to injury, friends stayed at the Luxor for $129 per night. Never again."
168,275,"Oct 4 2004 	Don't do it!!!!!!!!!	This &quot;hotel&quot; was grossly misrepresented on their Web-site. It was by far one of the seediest, tackiest hotels I have ever seen. It is under construction and we weren't even sure it was open when we pulled up. There were very few cars in the parking lot and not a sole to be seen. The area is very poorly lit and it made me very uncomfortable. My room smelled like Mothballs and I had an asthma attack as soon as I opened the door. We ended up moving to a major casino on the strip and not staying there, because I literally couldn't breath in my room. I was there attending a conference and our session had to move on the first day because you couldn't hear over the jack hammers and construction noise. One of the attendees from my conference had someone try and break into her room. When she spoke to the hotel manager (who was a woman) she was told &quot;that happens all the time&quot;. That's not exactly what I would call a compassionate customer oriented person. If you like seedy, tacky hotels that smell nasty, then the Alexis Park is the place to stay. If not, I recommend a hotel chain you have heard of.I will tell everyone I know to NEVER stay in this Hotel. It reminded me of what hotels would probably look like in downtown Baghdad"
169,275,Aug 25 2004	Enjoyable resort like hotel	My husband and I really enjoyed the Alexis. It is a bit off the beaten track and quiet. We stayed in a 2 level suite with a small hot tub in the room. It is an older hotel but well run and comfortable.
170,275,"Aug 14 2004	ups and downs	I was attending a conference so enjoyed the quiet, small scale of the place; well layed out; oasis-like; much greenery in this small-scale, unprentious place. About a mile from the Strip, which I walked during cooler May weather.Rooms are spacious &quot;suites&quot;; separate bedroom, a plus for those with kids or different time-clocks. Kitchette is simple, no stove, but decent frig. space to keep juices, milk, sandwiches for breakfast, lunch. Of the 3 pools, only one is working; the others make a good waterview in this desert area; lounging at any time is pleasant among the trees/birdcalls.Good casual and fancier restaurants on site, but no competition for Vegas dining. Friendly staff. Resort lacks the quiet glamor of the past, when &quot;suites&quot; were for upscale patrons. Has a slightly rumpled look, a bit out-of-place in glitzy Vegas. That's what I liked about the place! You have all the glitz/glamor a quick cab or shuttle ride from resort."
171,275,"Aug 10 2004	Great value just off strip	Quiet retreat just off the strip. Each building only 2 stories high. Parking close to room. Surprised at large accommodations- 2-room suite. Hotel does not have gambling, so very quiet. Good value alternative to large hotels on strip. Although hotel is older, it is clean and well kept. Would stay there again."
172,275,"Aug 10 2004	Where's the 25 acres of gardens?	My main problem with Alexis Park is that they WILDLY misrepresent themselves!!! If they called themselves something along the lines of an economy lodging sort of close to the strip, I'd think they were at least a somewhat decent value for the money (I paid about $65 a night).As it was, I got this hotel thru hotwire, where it represented itself as being a 3 1/2 STAR SUITE RESORT HOTEL. Of course as soon as I got the name of the hotel I looked it up on TripAdvisor and saw all the negative reviews, so at least I was prepared for what I got...which was a property that looked like a cheaply made over apartment complex from the 70s which some company figured they could, with the right advertising, pass off as an all suites hotel. When I called up the hotel directly, I was put on perma-hold and forced to listen to a shpiel about the property which, amongst other exagerated claims, tells about 25 acres of gardens. I'm not sure where those gardens are, but they certainly aren't anywhere near this hotel! The landscaping is pretty much like any $500 a month, get your first month's rent free type apartment complex, which is pretty much what this place really is! The rooms are NOT suites, the furnishings are incredibly tacky and cheap, the air conditioner is god awful loud, the walls are paper thin...HOWEVER, my room was pretty darned clean!"
173,275,"Jul 13 2004	Not as bad as some say...	I booked a room to this resort via Expedia for a very, VERY resonable rate considering we went for the 4th of July. We stayed July 3rd-5th (including a Sat. night) for ONLY $139! Check in only took about 10 minutes. The lobby was well kept and had many blooming potted orchids on the counter. The person behind the desk was friendly and offered good directions to get to our room. We were surprised at the size of the resort! Our room was clean and everything worked, although we did not try the iron. It was not a true suite because the bed was not located in a separate room. However, it reminded me of a studio apartment. You could tell where the &quot;bedroom&quot; was in relation to the &quot;living room.&quot; The &quot;living room&quot; area had a couch and squishy chair with a coffee table and lamp. There wasn't much drawer space but that was not important to us. The television offered a limited selection of channels. The wet bar area had a scary older mini fridge that worked, no microwave and a coffee maker that made a personal cup a coffee each time (i.e. it did not have a coffee pot). The bathroom was clean and well stocked with linens and soaps. The shower head was a bit low but the tub was a nice size. We weren't given any bubble bath the first night but the 2nd night a bottle was left for us. The queen bed was old and squeaky but still comfortable. The air conditioning was nice since it was over 100 degrees outside. There were 2 units controlled with one thermostat. One unit was placed blowing cold air onto the bed which made sleeping difficult but the vent was adjustable and the problem was quickly solved. No internet available for free. You can pay $9.95 to use it from noon today to noon the next day, no pro-rated time. No free phone calls whatsover. We only used the smaller pools, which were open 24 hours. They were very shallow and had issues with insects floating in the water. The 24 hour hot tub was a good temperature, not too hot, but it was also full of floating insects. The larger pool looked nice but we didn't get a chance to use it while we stayed there. During the day towels were plentiful in the clubhouse but by night they were all used and not restocked. It is quite evident that this is not the newest place. However, it's also not the most run down place as some say it is. I'm not sure how the &quot;stars&quot; and &quot;diamonds&quot; ratings on some website work, but this place is definitely nicer than the Motel 8 that some people we knew were staying at (and they paid only $10 less). Our check out was super fast, only about a few minutes and we were done! Considering that we went to Las Vegas during a busy holiday weekend, this was a great experience for us! We got more than we expected since we paid so little for the room. My boyfriend and I will definitely consider staying at Alexis Park Resort again."
174,275,"Jul 12 2004	It's a motel not a resort!	Alexis Park Resort is a motel. A very large motel with run-down rooms and very plain surroundings. There are something like 15 buildings in their charmless complex. My husband and I just returned from a road trip out west where we stayed in wonderful resorts in Utah and Arizona. Alexis Park is seedy and run-down. We bought our room night on Hotwire (beware the one that's called &quot;best value&quot; with resort and suite as indicators. Yes, our room was large but it was run-down, almost thread-bare, the bath plumbing was miserable and everything was old and used looking.We know there are really no deals to be had in Vegas but this confirmed it."
175,275,"Jul 3 2004 	Student Council Adviser Stayed there 7 days and had nothing but trouble	Got there(In 100 dgr weather) with 16 people all had wrong rooms had single beds in them even though I reserved them in Nov 03 (10 Rooms) with two double beds. Then was moved the AC did not work and for 3 days they tried to fix it and could not moved again (3rd time) and even then the AC fouled up had to get maintenance at 2AM to come in and stop the AC racket and defrost, what a nightmare..Mgr comped 4 days after my complaining .. Said he would comp 6 but reneged on that. Not very personable(his name was Dave. and saw another mgr named Linda Hutchins and she was even more unpleasant.. Can't see my self staying there again even for free...However the grounds were nicely kept and the help(except Mgrs) were very pleasant and tried to help as best they could."
176,275,"Jul 1 2004	Not as bad as I thought it would be!	I just returned on June 30 after a three night stay here for a conference. After reading some opinions I was worried. The hotel was full but check-in went fine and everyone was very nice. My room was large and clean (I was concerned about this).The sink had a odor to it but I was only over there to use the counter to iron on. The pipes were loud from the room next door when someone took and shower. The shower needs to be replaced but I think they are doing that building by building. We stayed there, I am sure, because we were there with high school students who were housed with familes. It is not somewhere I would stay when we visit Vegas but it did fill our needs."
177,275,"Jun 17 2004	Not fabulous but I'd stay here again	My first try posting a hotel review, please forgive any errors I make.Stayed here for one night (Saturday 6-12-2004 on a Priceline $90 bid, total was $106.02); not bad for a Saturday night only stay(?). Overall a good stay. I would stay here again.Took approx 30 minutes to check-in (not bad for 2 pm Saturday afternoon in Vegas?). No mention of Priceline, just the typical &quot;Your room has been prepaid, require a credit card for incidentals,&quot;. All friendly smiling reservation clerks on a Saturday afternoon in Vegas! Off strip, older resort with no casino. Located across street from the Hard Rock. 3 pools in complex (1 larger with jacuzzi area), many two story buildings with the pools located between. Complex and room was very clean. Everything (buildings, rooms, decor, etc) looked used and slightly worn but ok. All suites resort, mine was a smaller king bed suite but plenty big. Breakfast bar area had 2 chairs, wet bar/sink, small refrigerator, some storage shelves/space, no dishes or silverware. Sitting area had sofa sleeper, comfy chair, end table, coffee table, 32 inch TV on top of storage cabinet (only two small drawers). Sleeping area had two end table, a small desk with chair, and comfortable king size bed. There was a small (3 foot or so wide) closet with 6 hangers along with an iron and ironing board. Bathroom had nice big tub and shower along with a small sink and counter area. Also a hair dryer which I didn't use. Room had two air conditioners controlled by one thermostat; worked great as temp outside was 100 but it was nice and cool in the room. Southwestern decor, not my favorite but seemed ok. There were several lamps around the room so lighting was very good, even the bathtub/shower area had a light with a separate switch. Easy access to parking completely surrounding the complex so you could park (free) relatively close to your room. Not much of a view of Vegas and the landscaping was ok but not great."
178,275,"May 5 2004	you get what you pay for	Our group stayed two nights at the alexis park. i have read many reviews of this hotel some very good and some very bad. but lets all use some common sense and realize that overall you get what you pay for. this is an older hotel and at one time it was probably very beautiful. it has become run down with time and is in need of some major improvements, but, with those improvements the price increases accordingly ......... we payed a total of $150 for two WEEKEND nights compared with $249 for one weekday night at the rio. the alexis park does need some work and is not a 4-star hotel ....... but you are not paying a 4-star hotel rate."
179,275,Apr 27 2004	Never again	We just returned from Las vegas last night. We stayed at the Alexis because I had stayed there before and found it convenient to the strip with out being on the stip. The time I stayed 4 years ago the room was of need of updating so I checked to see if they had updated the rooms and they said they had and were under new management. It was somewhat convenient as we were traveling with a baby and thought since its on one level would work out best. The rooms were missing light fixtures parts with bulbs hanging down and bulbs out. Forget the mini bar area didn't even have a coffee pot so requested one and was told there were no cups or coffee. Big help. The groups that were there were very loud and were not pleasant to be around at the pool. Won't be returning.
180,275,"Apr 23 2004 	Poorly Staffed Run-Down Party Hotel	The Alexis Park was nothing like I expected. Our $159 room reeked of cheap deodorant spray, dried blood was on the shower head, the seats by the room's wet bar were horribly stained, the beds were rock hard. The rooms had absolutely no view. Checking in and out can take as much as an hour due to the lack of front desk staff (and phone calls to the front will be ignored). To make it worse, it's difficult to get a cab at the Alexis. During our stay, the rock band Phish was playing 3 sold-out shows nearby and the hotel was full of Phish &quot;heads&quot;. They checked in with cases of booze, coolers of beer and little clothing. One afternoon they had a party out at the pool with a DJ: thumping music, booze (the hot tub was full of screaming people tossing cans of beer and spraying water all over). One of the rooms even had a music/light show going on inside. You can do much better than this hotel. The room prices are too high for such run-down accomodations and lack of staff (polite as they may be)."
181,275,"Mar 29 2004	Okay place for an okay price	This hotel was just okay. The term &quot;suite&quot; is used loosly. It was just a large room. There was no microwave, but there was a large kitchen area with small fridge. It was a strange setup (nothing to cook with but a lot of room for cooking.) Beware not all &quot;Monarch&quot; suites have two rooms. TV reception was terrible. They made an attempt to fix it, but it didn't help. Only 1 small pool is heated. The other 2 are not and the large pool was never open during our stay (Spring Break 2004) There are no tennis courts (some sites say they have them) and the monarch suite does not have a jetted tub (only a large garden tub.) The price was okay but not great. I think I will stay at the Residence Inn next time (not far down the road off Paradise.) This place was nothing special."
182,275,"Mar 27 2004	We were PLEASANTLY surprised!!!	We booked our flight/hotel package online...the first time we had ever done so....just before we walked out the door to catch our flight I found this site and printed off the reviews to read on the plane.My wife and My hearts sank the further we read on about the Alexis Park...we decided that our holiday wouldn't be ruined as we'd only be sleeping there anyway....ya...ya...ya.We found the front desk clerk very friendly upon checking in so that was a plus.We were totally shocked when we got to our room and found this gorgeous suite(Monarch Suite) complete with a separate bedroom and TV with a huge jacuzzi tub,separate shower for two and enough towels for a family of 6....not sure why you'd want to take your family to Vegas however....this town is NOT a place for children. We had room service the next morning and the attendant could not have been more pleasant and polite. We found the pool areas clean and never a fight to find a place to lounge in the sun....oh....they may want to fix their lounge chairs...few would adjust to sit up......and perhaps March weather has not yet warmed the pool water....was a bit cold to swim in even tho the outside temp was in the high 80's. Other than that we had a wonderful stay there.....we enjoyed the fact that you could get away from the gaming areas by being at a hotel without gaming....nice and quiet. We will come again......and will certainly be recommending it to our friends."
183,275,"Mar 23 2004	Poorly Run Business	I did not stay here, decided to stay on the strip. However - although they told me my account was credited for the deposit, it has not been in five weeks. I have called the accounting dept. EIGHT times and gotten no answer, including calls to management. I have left FIVE messages over a period of two weeks and no one has called me back even though I have told them how many times I have called and asked for someone to PLEASE CALL ME! I have now had to dispute this charge with Visa. I am so glad I did not stay here."
184,275,"Mar 22 2004	After numerous stay still love Alexis Park!	An excellent choice for non-gaming stay; as frequent visitors to Vegas, Alexis Park has remained, after numerous stays, a favorite place to stay. They have a bar/grill and a nicer restaurant, and a large lobby with numerous chairs and couches, as well as a small gift shop.It has REAL suites, with even the smallest, the Monarch, being like a small apartment. Pricing for the Monarch is usually under $100!The property is laid out like an apartment complex, with great grounds to stroll through, numerous pools and spas; the fitness center here is free for hotel guests (unlike so many other LV hotels). They have a great fitness center, too - machines, spa, showers ...with more towels available than you can count - his and her wet areas are, of course, separate -Can't believe the negative reviews - the entire resort was recently sold (stayed last Dec. 2003), and all the rooms have been remodeled. All changes from here on should be positive, due to capital influx.This is a non-gaming resort located on Harmon west of Paradise, just across from The Hard Rock, where you can catch a shuttle to the strip, if needed.One word of warning - although units are large, there is no dining table in the suite - kitchen/ bar area has fridge and sink, but no microwave -also, there are no stairs if you get an upstairs suite."
185,275,"Feb 25 2004	Not the best	Just visited here. It is an OK place. The common area was nice and the restaurant food was super. The rooms are something less than I expected. Doesn't look like the pictures that is for sure. The rooms need updating. They are run down and need paint, furniture, and appliances. The exteriors needed paint also. Staff was really nice. There are better deals for the $$. It is also about 9/10 ths of a mile from the strip."
186,275,"Jan 24 2004	Less Than Expected	Stayed there recently for a business meeting. Overall an OK place to stay, but many basics were lacking, including in-room coffee and a complimentary newspaper. Housekeeping staff failed to replace soap and shampoo, and the high speed internet didn't work during the entire four night stay. Lounge closed at 10:00 each night, even though several guests would have paid to stay much later. If you can get a good rate, stay. If not, go elsewhere."
187,275,"Jan 12 2004	Do not stay here!!	This is possibly the worst hotel ( operates like that of a cheap motel) in Las Vegas. The rooms are large but have numerous problems ie.. phone lines not working, HVAC units not operating, water pressure, bad lighting and bugs. Do not even attempt to contact the front desk over the phone. It took over 20 minutes until the phone was even picked up and then we were on hold for another ten minutes and all this to put in a wake up call. The property does not have a very safe feeling to it, to many dark areas and is not located in the best part of town. We will never stay here again."
188,275,Dec 2 2003	A lot better then expected.	We arrived @ 9 am Saturday morning and did not think they would let us check in until check in time. But no they were very pleasent and let us check in @ 9am to my surprise. The outside is pretty worn down and I was kinda nervous but the inside was really nice. The bath tub was huge and the water pressure was perfect. Everything was great. For only 49.00 and not having to deal with a casino and all the smoke and noise it was perfect. We arrived @ 9am Nov.23 and left 24th Sunday @ 2:00. I would say it is not for everyone becuz it is far from the normal out of contro Vegas Hotel...
189,275,"Dec 1 2003	Alexis Park - no welcome here	We visited the Alexis Park all the way from the UK and although we couldn't grumble about the price -our deal of $70 a night was good value - we were very disappointed with our welcome. The receptionist was totally uninterested in us when we arrived and gave us no information whatsoever about the hotel. and nor was there any in the room. The suite was OK if rather dark although the kitchen was dirty and on the middle one of our three nights there the trash wasn't emptied. Not a bad deal but if you're going in November, as we did, and are prepared to wait till you get there we reckon you can get a better deal on the spot."
190,275,"Nov 4 2003	Great	I was suprised to see all the negitive reviews. We had a bedroom and a spacious living room. Room service was good. And the rooms were wonderfully decorated and very clean. The lobby was spacious and nice, my friends and I hung there till 2am, because it was so compy and nice to relax."
191,275,Sep 17 2003	Not Worth The Money	As a 30 year resident I have stayed at many of the local hotels. With that said I can assure you that you do not want to stay at Alexis Park. On the weekend that I stayed there they were hosting a company pool party until 1am. Loud music could be heard inside my room making it very hard to sleep. There was a walkway just outside my window and the conversations of those passing by could be heard inside. The windows dont have adequate sound insulation. I sent a letter to Alexis Park but never received a response.
192,275,"Sep 15 2003	No hassles and spacious!	I don't know what happened with all the other people who stayed her but this is one of the better places I've stayed in Vegas. I'd stay here again anytime. Don't expect much luxury--it's more like a one-bedroom apartment. They are all suites, and are spacious, the beds are comfy, and the lobby area is enormous! It's right over by the Hard Rock and Ellis Island. I liked that it didn't have a smoky casino and that it wasn't right on the strip. Some of the fixtures are a little cheap, and the shower head must be good for a four-foot tall person, but that's about it for the downside.. I guess if you just plan on staying in your room and ordering room service, this isn't the place for you, but if you're looking for a convenient, quiet place with nice large units, it's perfect! Tip: try to get an upstairs unit if you plan on sleeping in. It's popular with families so there are lots of slamming minivan doors and arguing siblings in the morning."
193,275,"Sep 3 2003	Not bad as expected with reviews	Read all of the negative reviews. Was expecting to be disappointed, but was impressed upon arrival at the Alexis. Rooms of the $69 suite were very large and neat. TV and air conditioner in each room - small fridge was a great benefit. Grounds and pools very clean and well kept. The only somewhat bad thing I can say is that the air condition had a slightly moldy smell. I needed a band-aid from all the walking we did. Gift shop was closed (out to lunch) but the front desk was quick to send Security to our room with a handful of band-aids free of charge. Shuttle service to the strip was just across the street (make sure you check service schedule at Hard Rock for changes). If you want or expect the Aladin, Mirage or Bellagio stay there, otherwise your stay at the Alexis should be pleasurable. We'll definitely stay there again and recommend it (if you're not looking for slots in the lobby). Nice experience."
194,275,"Aug 27 2003	Do not stay here	We were sorely disappointed with our stay here. The first room we went to had no working lights. Second was fine until food was brought in, then the ants came. They did come and spray, but the spray was too overpowering and had to move to another room. Third room the toliet leaked when flushed. Mind you this was all on the first night of our stay. We finally got into the fourth room and in the morning when we attempted to take a shower the faucet fixture fell out of the wall. Needless to say, we were going to move to another hotel. Only then did they offer a room upgrade or any kind of compensation. We didn't want either. We quickly called around and moved to the Amerisuites and enjoyed the rest of our time in Las Vegas."
195,275,"Jul 31 2003	A Little Above Average	Strengths - Close to airport. Nice clean pool. Towels provided on pool chairs. Decent gym. Decent friendly staff. Air conditioning unit monitored very well.Weakness' - No fan in the bathroom for ventilation. Sloppy, food trays left in corridor for one full day and night. Concierege does not go out of way to help. I had to call her off her computer before she finally came out. No coffee pot in room. No access to one of the pools on Sunday afternoon/evening because Las Vegas models posed in the pool."
196,275,"Jul 23 2003	Save your Money	Horrible service, horrible rooms, horrible location."
197,275,"Jul 9 2003	Somewhat disappointing	Had to change rooms - A/C unit was making such a racket that no one could sleep. When maintenance finally came, they said they couldn't fix it because the A/C units are old....as well as the rest of the hotel. Doors don't shut properly (some are warped from age), simple things such as lamps having burnt out bulbs (no one ever came by to replace them although we requested it), found hair in food (room service). Fortunately they didn't charge us for that plate. Not cracked up what it should be, you'd be better off in a budget motel. Old place, should be torn down."
198,275,"Jun 2 2003	Loved the Alexis	My sister and I did extensive research and ended up booking at Alexis Park. We wanted a suite, OFF the strip, a pool and a great rate. We stayed a full week in June of 2001 and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. Did not eat in the cafe but did use the pool and found it to be fine. Our suite was large, the rate was excellent, the limited contact with the staff we had was fine and the location was great. Cleanliness level seemed to be fine; I have no memory of any problem. Believe me, we would have called if there had been an issue. Very quiet, not a lot of people around. I would much rather stay there than have to deal with the hordes on the Strip. I would hate to have to walk through a lobby in my robe on the way to a pool. Ours was just out the door. Would definately go back. A short drive to shopping."
199,275,"May 19 2003	What a hole	The reason I stayed was for a conference held at this hotel. If I knew better before I would have booked something on the strip. My reservation was not the room I received, the room had peeling paint in the shower, the bathtub was filthy, the tv remote didn't work, the refrigerator didn't work, and it was infested with moths. (We killed an average of 6 everyday in our room, even climbed out of the pay phones.).We asked to change our room, which they did, but said that a king or non-smoking room if requested is not guaranteed upon arrival by the hotel.The next room was nice, but the towel racks weren't on the walls, the brackets were, but the racks weren't. I overheard our cleaning person on the phone saying she had been asking for this a week now.I asked the front desk, they wouldn't cash a traveler's check. We even had trouble getting change for a $20.Nobody seemed to want to help, their response were always short and quick.I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
200,275,"May 15 2003	Nice and cheap	I found the Alexis Park to be what I expected. The room was clean, the hotel was cheap and I had no problems with it whatsoever. Right across the street from the Hard Rock was nice, they have a free shuttle to different parts of the strip.I'd stay here again."
201,275,"Apr 26 2003	3 Stars	Stayed in Alexis Park for one Sat night, April 19. The room was neat and clean. Both bed sheet and bath towels were also very clean. There were two TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Had a good night sleep, which was all I needed. And did I mention the room was only $55 on Sat?"

1,276, it came with one towel. We stayed one night but just forfeited our second night becuase of the &quot;strict no refund policy&quot; and our disgust of the place. I would not recommend going to this hotel but if you still think you want to don't bother reserving it online (it won't fill up) go there and check it out and then go somewhere else...Also the free WIFI wouldn't work (I'm a computer geek so I could have made it work if it was functioning)	
2,276, cleanliness and safety. The rooms are clean and anyone who doesn't belong around the property is promptly removed. This place has shown definate improvement and the next time we head out to Vegas
3,276, for over a hundred dollars a night it was most likely our worst stay ever in any motel around the world. And we travel a lot.	
1,279,Nov 10 2009 	Great Dealers!	Loved the dealers on the grave yard shift! They are so much fun! This is just a relaxed and fun place to enjoy yourself. You save your money and then you have some to spend on the tables. Thanks for such a fun time!
2,279,"Oct 5 2009 	When only the finest dump will do...	Jeesh. I can't decide if it was either the 7-11 next door with people hanging out drinking, the guy who decided it was a good idea to tie his 2 pit pull dogs up at 2am in the parking lot, the stained carpeting and couch in our room, or the paper thin walls where you hear everything.Spend whatever money you think you're saving and stay somewhere else other than here. The rooms may be large, and sure you may be getting a &quot;suite&quot; with two rooms, but don't be fooled.I voiced my complaints to the front desk clerk, but he didn't seem too interested in making me feel much better."
3,279,"Sep 29 2009 	Best bang for your buck	If you go in expecting brand new top of the line furniture or a bellboy to carry your luggage, then you're in for a disapointment. But if you go in with an open mind and knowing what a 2 star hotel looks like or should look like then there will be no disapointments. The hotel has large rooms. The pool is pretty small but clean and you will have it to yourself most of the time. There's 2 security guards walking around the property 24 hours a day. There's a good size casino with 5 restaurant options including a daily breakfast, lunch and dinner buffet. The hotel is about a 10 minute drive to downtown and about a 15 minute drive to the strip. The room was clean everyday when we got back. My wife and I were impressed with the service and room for the price and we will definetely be staying here next time around. When my wife and I travel the only thing we use our room for is to sleep and store luggage the rest of the time we are out and exploring. If this sounds like you, this hotel will not disapoint you."
4,279,"Sep 18 2009 	Great experience both times!!	Unbelieve prices and good accomadations! I have family in Vegas whom my parents visit monthly. Arizona Charlie's boulder is their hotel of choice and I see why. On the 2 trips we have been able to take with them, we have really enjoyed our stay! The price is unbeatable ($25 a night!!) I was pleasently shocked on our first stay that the second bed was in the living area, it was nice to have our privacy. My husband is 6'2 and over 200 lbs, his feet hung off the full size bed, and we had t cuddle some, but we can't complain too much because the price was so amazing! On both trips we took the room has been a little dirty, well, not dirty, just had some cobwebs on the ceiling and black shoe prints on the ceiling as well (weird that both rooms had the show prints.) I recommend this hotel to anyone! Very spacious and accomadating and the price is amazing!!!"
5,279,"Sep 14 2009 	Very good hotel and casino	If you think this place is not a great value, you are just a hater, and probably always complain .....We stayed here this past weekend, and everything was perfect......NO ROACHES anywhere.....The staff was very friendly and couldnt have been more of what we wanted them to be like....The rooms were very clean---big----and the price was right....$50 Friday and Saturday for a 2 room suite....The buffet was also priced right and the food was very good...We will for sure try to come back here next time when we go to Vegas and also tell our friends the same....."
6,279,"Jun 30 2009 	Roach Heaven	Check in - paid for a suite - No bellman to help with luggage, after carrying in the luggage found 2 dead roaches. We reloaded the car and checked out - they did not refund the charge for the room."
7,279,"Jun 22 2009 	more than I expected	Just returned from a 3 day trip. This hotel/motel is a nice place. Rooms are 2 room suite. We had a double and king bed. Court yard was pretty with palm trees, flowers and a fountain. Only fault was the fan in the bathroom was loud. Check in and out was easy."
8,279,"Jun 19 2009 	It was quiet and pleasant especially for the price.	I stayed her with my spouse for a weekend getaway in Vegas. It was great everything was in order, no foul play anywhere as stated in other reviews. I also found it more pleasing that the casino folk and the people actually staying in the hotel we're no where near each other. It was a quiet and pleasant stay. We had a blast and will stay there again and again. Especially for that price. oh the only thing is they have a deposit of $35, which you get back upon check out, but it was unexpected for me-just caught me off guard, seeing as how it was prepaid."
9,279,Jun 10 2009 	Good Room Cheap Price	Everyyhing went Aok . Hotel was quite clean and at a good price
10,279,Mar 20 2009 	There are better places to stay on a budget	This hotel is located 5 miles east of the strip on Boulder highway- the rooms are tired but really big and cheap. Almost no soundproofing so you hear every step overhead.Awful tv in the rooms and no in room coffee service and cheap ice buckets made me feel like I was in a cheap roadside motel. The food in the upstairs restaurant was cheap and filling with their gamblers card and the casino is running a rebate on your losses up to 100 bucks so you can gamble for a longer time- but no need to stay here. Do expect lots of smoke in the casino so do not wear your fanciest duds.
11,279,"Nov 12 2008 	Not fancy bit very reasonable prices.	The Hotel Casino is not on the strip.... a fair drive from it, but much quieter. Parking was a bit confusing, so the best place is in the garage behind the casino, where you can take the elevator to the main floor. The hotel desk is best reached, however, from the valet driveway. When we arrived, there was no sign of a parking valet, however.The place is more of a motel than hotel, with multiple buildings and floors. The room was VERY inexpenive (only $34.99 less a $10 discount for a Nevada resident) and was actually a two room &quot;suite&quot;. The room was clean but somewhat old, but for the price, it was well worth it. If you are on a budget, this is a good choice. The buffet on Monday was 2 for 1 and the food was fairly decent. Not bad for a couple at $10.17!"
12,279,"Jul 27 2008	By golly spend the extra $10 and stay elsewhere.	Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. This may go down as one of the worst hotel experiences I've had. Here are the facts, ma'am:1. The air conditioner - on full blast - struggled to keep our room temperature down to a sweaty, toasty 76 degrees. 2. The television - which looked like it was from a closeout special a decade ago - had a snowy picture.3. Thug types run amok in the complex.4. While #3 happens, the yellow-shirted security guard clips his fingernails. No, I'm not exaggerating; I (unfortunately) saw it.5. The ice machine on our floor did not work.6. I asked for a room with two beds, and while I did get this, there were two ROOMS as well, which only compounded the air conditioning problems.7. We had plenty of hand towels but no wash clothes.8. Because I booked a room for two consecutive nights but on under two different reservation numbers, I returned after my first night to find myself locked out of my room. I had to go to the desk and RE-CHECK IN, then MOVE TO ANOTHER ROOM! Hello? Hello? Anyone home? Common sense? When I initially checked in, the woman simply said, &quot;Two beds, three nights.&quot; She did not say, &quot;Two beds, three nights, three different rooms.&quot; Good grief.9. Much of the staff seems paranoid. This is one thing I don't have hard evidence of; call it a general feeling.10. The carpet was dirty.Now, don't get me wrong: I do not expect much when I spend $60 for a Friday night in Vegas. But I do expect a clean room with a working air conditioner (Vegas in July, people...) and some iota of common sense from the staff. But you won't get that.I try to find the good in everything, so I'll say that when I found a working ice machine, the ice was cold.I can't stress this enough: Do not stay here, even if it is cheap."
13,279,"May 29 2008 	Pleasant Surprise	As we wanted to stay away from the high weekendrates in Vegas we booked this hotel for 3 nights (fri-mo), paying 98euro in total through Expedia.Location:Though on the Boulder Strip it's location is ok really. It's a 15 minute drive from the Strip if you take Flamingo. Close by are Sam's Town and Boulder Station. There's a new Walmart Supercenter across from Sam's Town.Hotel: The hotel has several buildings. We think they are in good condition. We had a (big) corner room facing the (cold) pool. We were pleasantly surprised as this room turned out the a two room, two bed 'suite'. Though there's not a lot of furniture in the rooms..there's a sofa and two tv's. The bathroom is ok, but the fan is really(i mean REALLY) loud (goes on when you turn on the light).The carpet was brand new and we noticed they were replacing carpets in other buildings to.Icemachines are not located on every floor so prepare to hike...Pool : Small, but has a hot tub as well. Plenty of good seats and beds, both in shade and sun. Towels are provided, but we found the box empty most of the time. A call to housekeeping was enough to fill the box again though.Parking: Though quite a pain at night, during the day there's enough parking availabe. At night just use the free valet service if you don't want to wait for a free spot.Casino: We didn't gamble here, but found the casino a bit cramped and smokey. Registration is in the Casino. The other reception they used to have south of the hotel towers is closed now.Buffet:We were pleasantly surprised. We had breakfast here and the quality of the food is good. They cook eggs to order and have fresh donuts. Price was less than 4 bucks with Players Card which is really cheap.If you are looking for a cheap, clean room this is a good place. if you are in vegas as a tourist and you have just a few days here....you better choose a hotel closer to the Strip. I suggest Terrible's which is within walking distance of the Bally's/Paris corner of the Strip."
14,279,"Apr 9 2008	Nice Hotel Good Location and Great Price	We drove from Wisconsin to Las Vegas. The hotel was easy to find, right off the highway. We booked our room online about a month before we arrived. For $40 a night you can't beat the price, especially for a King Suite Room.We returned each night to find our room was cleaned, beds made and a seashell fan made out of the roll of toilet paper (that was a nice touch).There are two Arizona Charlies in Las Vegas, and while this one did not have shuttle service (The one on Decatur does). We ate at both and ours (on Boulder) had much better food."
15,279,"Mar 17 2008 	Great value!	This was a quick stay of two nights on our way home from California. I had to visit a LV emergency room and needed to rest after receiving medication, but we ended up in Las Vegas several hours ahead of our original plan. I called Arizona Charlies to ask if we could check in early--this was just after 9 a.m. They got us a room right away. It was large, very clean, and non-smoking. yea!The next morning, after heading to an early breakfast in the Wild West Buffet inside, the lady behind the counter was very kind in giving myself and my two children the cheaper rate...if you held a casino gambling card. They have no children's buffet rate, and I was happy for the kind discount. The buffet had a great choice and was good food. We waddled out contentedly.:)We were gone just under an hour, but upon returning to our room, it had been made up and cleaned---all before 9. That was nice!The only problem was checking in and out. The air quality in the casino itself is terrible. I had to breathe through my shirt while at the hotel registration desk. When I mentioned it to the lady behind the counter, she agreed, stating, &quot;I have to sit in it all day, and my lungs are terrible.&quot; I booked through Expedia---having used them for years. We paid $35 a night and I feel it was a great deal for the money. They no longer offer the shuttle, but we had our car with us anyway. :)"
16,279,"Mar 5 2008	Problems with this hotel which is really a motel and casino.	This hotel is really a multi-stored motel behind the casino. Management is very oriented to casino customers and does not seem to care much about overnight customers. First, there is no indication of where registration is located or where to park to register. Finally, valet parking man indicated to park on red curb area (fire lane location?) in the &quot;Thru Lane&quot; in front of casino. There were parking spots in front of motel rooms, but these were mostly occupied by local gamblers so sometimes you are forced to park far away in garage. No indication spaces near motel were reserved for room guest. The room was humblely furnished, had a big living room and a nice size bedroom. However, the bath room smelled awful from mildew/mold. Nearest ice mache did not work. Had warning that all items in room were inventoried so do not steal anything. Also, be sure to secure main door with lock device when in room. Prices of food and room were cheap, but I would not stay there again. There are other better place for about same money in Vegas."
17,279,"Dec 27 2007 	Cheesy trailer trash style but we loved it!!	We were in Vegas for 10 days. We stayed here for about 5 of the 10 , both weekday and weekend. We found our suite to be clean and the cleaning staff, front desk staff to be friendly, very helpful. We needed extra towels once but had to go to front desk to get. The rates ofcourse change dramatically from weekday to weekend but that is typical Vegas. We gambled here , had a great time, and found weather you are at one of the big hotels or the smallest out of town casinos, winning or losing is the same. We actually preferred gambling at this hotel/casino because of itssmaller size and pay outs were more often and more $$$ than the big glitzy hotels/casinos on the strip. The food at the buffet was great,,, I mean a buffet for $5.99 or $7.99 is a great value,,,and the food is good!!!! The most you waited in line was maybe 15 minutes with about 20 people in line. We saw lineups at the Paris hotel with 200 people waiting to get in to eat a $12.99 breakfast. Hello!!! Tired of buffet?? Try the Yukon Grill, which is in the Arizona Charlies ,upper level, this restauant is first class, food is fantastic and the service is #1, the Chef even comes over to talk with you.... You must try this gem , and the prices were reasonable... Other thing I like about this place was no waiting for a slot machine there are plenty to go around,,,lots of payout machines to get your cash/winnings...Downside, well yes the neighbourhood is a little seedy, and yes there were punks hanging out on our stairwell once , but a quick call to security and they were chased away... There is plenty of security on bikes here, which I had never experienced before but I guess there is a reason for them , to keep the place safe, and keep the gamblers safe...I learnt in Vegas Always be aware of your surroundings.....The pool was clean and refreshing on a hot afternoon."
18,279,"Dec 25 2007 	Why Bother?	I'd gambled at Arizona Charlie's Boulder previously but never stayed at the hotel until my most recent trip. Friends had traveled with their RV and this happened to be close to the RV park where they stayed. Trust me, this hotel is as close to the end of the line as I want to be,The room was large but really threadbare and had cigarette burns all over (despite being a non-smoking room.) It's not a convenient trek from the room to the casino. The rooms are comparable to a Motel 6, only larger. There is also no Internet access.The casino staff was very friendly but the place seemed a lot smokier than I remembered. I couldn't play for long periods because of thoke, so I often went elsewhere.Others have complained about the neighborhood; it obviously isn't high class but I encountered no problems. I did have a car, though, and didn't rely on shuttles or public transit.If everything else is booked or if you're on the thinnest of shoestring budgets, this place is OK, but really, there are nicer places to stay for only a few bucks more which are quite a bit nicer."
19,279,Dec 9 2007	Stinks!!!	Could not breathe because of stinking heavy cigarette smoke. Owners should install some sort of clean air machine or something. Would have stayed longer if the smoke hadn't been so bad
20,279,"Oct 16 2007 	Great for a basic accomadation for a low price.	We stayed here one night. We are a family of 4 adults, one tween and a toddler. This afforded us reasonable and convenient accomadations for a very reasonable price. The rooms are large -- consist of a sitting area and a seperate bedroom and bath with a very large closet. It is great in that way because the rooms afford a lot of privacy.The rooms are also convenient for coming and going because they are outside rooms with free parking. This is both good and bad -- you also have to walk outside to get to other parts of the motel/hotel -- such as the casino, pool, dining, etc. The food at the buffet (as well as the service) was really good.This would be a great place if you are coming and going -- or adults who care little about hotel features and more about Vegas attractions. You would definately want a car since the strip is about 8 to 10 minutes away -- and it is an easy drive.For families looking for more inclusive atmosphere -- just a mile away is Sam's Town -- a better location with kids and just a little more money."
21,279,"Jul 24 2007	Great bargain for a suite	Stayed on a very busy weekend 7/7/07. Booked the suite since we would have our 6 year old granddaughter with us. Surprised at how big the suite was. Had a small couch, coffee table, end table, TV in a cabinet and a full size bed in the main room and a King in the second room with a bathroom. Nice to be able to close the door between the rooms. It was clean and comfortable. Sink is outside of the small toilet, tub area. Entering from the parking tower to the casino we were confused as to were the check in desk was so we asked an employee on the casino floor for directions. With a smile she had us follow her all the way through the casino to the check in desk. The staff at check in was also very polite and helpful. Good value in the buffet and cafe with friendly staff also. I would only stay here if you have your own car. It's a bit far from the strip or downtown to take a taxi which might get expensive. Two night stay on Sat/Sun. was only $109.00 booking weeks in advance on the hotel web site. We plan to try the Decatur location even though it cost more just to see if we like it better but will stay at the Boulder location again also. I was worried that it would be a dump because of the low price but it was fine. Yes we have stayed at nicer places and some not so nice and paid a lot more."
22,279,"Jul 24 2007 	Unfortunately this is where you end up staying when the strip is booked	I think we stayed here 1 or 2 nights with another couple and we were not staying at Cheap Charlie's because we wanted to. You get what you pay for and the rooms actually aren't that bad, just not well maintained or cleaned.If we could have afforded the suites on the strip we would have stayed there instead. But Oh well Hotel served us like it should and no one ended up dead. Just be aware that this is not the Las Vegas Strip and the clientle over here is not the same either. So in brief this is not a place to plan your trip around, but if you need to find a room at the last minute, this will do, just be aware of your surroundings and keep a light on."
23,279,"Jul 22 2007 	Good enough!	Room was &quot;worn&quot;, but as expected for $30 a night. Had to walk &quot;aways&quot; to the casino, and the parking filled up quick in the evening.Had issue in the casino as I wanted to take advantage of a highly publicized promotion &quot;Re-imburse the first $100 of your losses on the first day&quot;.I had signed up for the A.C.E. Rewards card on-line when I made my hotel reservations two months ago, and I was informed that I was &quot;ineligible&quot; for the $100 re-imbursement as I was not considered a &quot;new customer&quot;. I had just received my membership card that day, upon my arrival. I couldn't get anyway to help me or budge, so they've lost me as a return customer and I'm telling everyone I know and about my experience."
24,279,"Jul 16 2007 	All that and a bag of chips	Arizona Charlies is a small casino on Boulder highway. We ( a family of 5 with two teens) stayed 4 nights here for a BMX race at Southpoint .  The location, off the 215 at flamingo, was easy enough to access for all of Las Vegas. Access to a vehicle is a must, esp. in the summer. The temp. was triple digit teens the whole time we we there. A few large Casinos are nearby but everything is a drive. The Rooms- They are as the other reviews state; nothing fancy.We rented two King Double suites. Two rooms,Two beds, T.V.'s couch,table and ample storage for clothes. We kept Three bicycles in one suite with room to spare. The corner suite was a little bigger. And the sink in the room was funky. I tried to be critical of everything knowing that I would write a review, and really could'nt find anything wrong. No mystery stains, comfy beds and sanitary toilets. Tokeing housekeeping got fresh towels. We paid rack rates , thur arrival and Mon. departure and it came to $400 total for both rooms! Such a deal. If you're a family traveling on a budget, this is a very good value for your hard earned cash. The Casino- Plenty of Penny and Nickle machines. Lots of video poker and keno. Most are older (1 or 2 years) It was never crowded, and finding a machine was pretty easy. A small but decent Race and sports book. It closed early though, so if you like to play Harness, go to Sams Town down the street. Bingo can be had 24-7. We played a few times. Games called rather quick Payouts were good. Table games were small and a seat could be found even at peak times. Only two crap tables. Lounge act was rather silly but better than the drone of slots. No live Keno. Not too smokey. Lots of locals.The food- Basic eats. The Buffet was inexpensive, Hot food, Fresh and plenty of it. We ate at least one of our meals of the day there and everyone walked away full, even the picky teens. Same for the 24 hr.Sourdough Cafe. Try their Strawberry shortcake. If you eat the whole thing and get sick, it's your fault.The Staff- I did'nt find a single Grouch. Everyone was happy and helpful. A rare thing indeed. Overall- Because the Hotel is separate from the Casino, One must walk outside to and fro. This creates the problem of walking around at all hours with large sums of cash in hand. the staff has provided Armed Security Guards on bicycles roaming the property. I saw no less than three in one morning while throwing all the equipment in the truck. I felt safe at all times, and that's not an easy thing for me. Because the rates are so reasonable, There were quite a few traveling workers here.They work long hours and just want to sleep when they get back. Our rooms were on the ground level, and I did not hear unneccesary noise from abouve, although the kids did in their room.  There are valid reasons not to stay here, But for us, it fit well and We will be back."
25,279,"Jun 15 2007 	Scary! Run Away!	The only reason we stayed here was: We had a large group, and a lot of hotels were booked due to NASCAR weekend or totally over priced.This place is scary! There are scary locals creepy around the casino. Hold onto your purses! Seen some gang bangers lurking around the hotel. Thank god for the security guards riding their bikes around...but they were on the weird side as well.Maid service came in and made our beds even though we had the &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; on the door. I wasn't very happy about this considering I thought I made my bed just fine and I don't want strangers in my room. A guy staying down the hall said when he got out of the shower there were 2 security guards standing in his room. He asked them what they wanted and they said they thought they smelled smoke then walked out.??Weird!We spent soooo much money taking taxies to the strip from Arizona Charlies. This is when we were lucky to have a taxi come by. NO TAXIES COME BY AZC!!!! You have to walk WAY up the road to another casino, soooo girls wear comfortable shoes!Hell hole! Don't do it!"
26,279,"May 23 2007	Not a good location or safe place	Well we just needed a place to stay as we were visiting family in the area. We had no intrest in the casino so the fact that it was not close to our room was ok. The eating cafe was ok, nothing fancy. Smoke is the smell of everything in the casino areas. The room was ok, clean enough for the price. The area is not safe. There was a fight in the parking lot one night but security was there to break it up fast. The noise was high as many that use this hotel are workers in the area. Police activity is very high in this area as well as drunks, bums, and pimps looking for activity. If you stay in your room after 10 and pile stuff in front of the door to feel safe this is your place to stay. The staff was ok but you have to ask for everything you want such as hair dryers and coffee pots. I would guess many walk off the grounds. Don't be fooled by the good price. This is a beware place. It is erie and I would not go there again if it was the last place on earth. I shook in my pants every night. If you are looking for a family hotel try the chain hotels, much better areas and even the higher price is worth it. Better safe then sorry. Unhappy Camper"
27,279,"May 16 2007 	Remember this isn't ""The Strip""	First of all, remember that you aren't staying on the Las Vegas Strip. If you are staying on the Boulder Strip, your focus should be cheap gambling and cheap hotel rooms - because that's what you'll get. That is what I was looking for and Arizona Charlie's delivered. The hotel was cheap, but clean. The dealers were friendly. They had $3 craps, $5 paigow, and $5 blackjack. My husband and I were looking for a place to gamble where we weren't going to spend $200 a night to stay at the hotel and that's what we got.Also, while we were there, the bar at Charlie's had a band that was a lot of fun and added to the overall gambling experience.Don't expect a huge casino or luxury rooms - it's basic. I wouldn't recommend the buffet there and you should totally get a car so you can visit Boulder Station and Sam's."
28,279,"Mar 30 2007 	Not Great Not Terrible	The good news is that it was a two room suite, near a very nice pool area and just across the driveway from the casino.The room was tired, could use some upgrading.If you aren't paying too much, it isn't terrible for a few nights."
29,279,"Feb 14 2007	Your typical LV low class hotel	Booked and prepaid my reservations via Expedia. From the website, I thought the hotel was part of the casino. It's not. It is a seperate building and looks exactly like the other cheap motels along the Boulder Highway. Check in was inside the casino, by the gift shop. Because I prepaid the room, I didn't want to put down a credit card. Instead I was forced to pay $35. in case I &quot;lifted something from the room&quot;. The next morning, I had to get my deposit back. By the time they made up the room, I would have been long gone. Don't understand this policy at all. Both check-in and check-out personnel were indifferent. Both tried to sign me up for their &quot;player's club&quot; card.The rooms were suppose to be &quot;suites&quot;, bywhich, you had to seperate rooms. Although spacious, they were both small and sparse. The bathroom was tiny and difficult to use.Both Expedia and the Casino should clearly state that this is a motel and not a hotel by any means of the word. Also, their check-in policy should be made clear at the time of booking.Would not stay at this location again, only because there are other motels on the Boulder Highway just like it."
30,279,"Jan 9 2007 	not good but not bad either	There were LOTS of ANTS on sink. We have to kill them all before brush our teeth. The bed sheets smells a bit, you can hear voices from other rooms, the parking lot is ALWAYS FULL, some people take 2 spaces for one car, the security was there but didn't say anything.However, the front desk was friendly, the housekeeping too. It's not too far fron the strips, the price is reasonable. We would probably stay there again but will request a room without ants =)"
31,279,"Dec 11 2006 	Friendly people great deals	We've stayed downtown and played at Arizona Charlie's for several years so this time we decided to stay there. We recieved a coupon deal that resulted in us paying $ 20 per night for four nights. Since we played there our comp earnings covered all of our food as well (not a high roller). The staff, from dealers to the check-in lady to slot personnel were the friendliest I have seen in over 20 years of visiting Vegas. They smiled and said hello whether I did or not! Meals at the buffet are terrific and most reasonable. They are making a huge effort to make the landscaping and grounds look very sharp....and it shows. The grounds are clean and neat. The only odd thing I encountered was the room layout. There's lots of room in the 2-room suites, but the layout makes it look rather sparse. It really needs more furniture and larger TV's...but these were minor drawbacks to us since all we do in the room is sleep. This oddity was more than overcome by all the other pluses. I'll be back."
32,279,"Dec 9 2006 	Basic but clean	Basic accommodation. Don't expect anything fancy, but it was very clean but looking a bit worn around the edges. At $31 C per night mid-week in early December including taxes it was a bargain. If you book through Travelocity the rate is about $15 less than on the Arizona Charlie web site. A bit of plumbing noise from other rooms, and in the morning the cleaning staff were noisy outside on the open corridors. Sign up for their Ultimate Rewards card on the internet before you go and you can get discounts and a free buffet after only a bit of play. The buffet was barely adequate, but for the price was OK."
33,279,"Oct 11 2006 	Great!	Just returned from another great trip to Vegas. I had stayed at the other Arizona Charlie's location on Decatur a couple of years back and it was great, so I figured I couldn't go wrong with the Boulder location. I am a member of their Ultimate Rewards club (the players club for both Arizona Charlie's locations as well as the Stratosphere) and responded to a direct offer I had received from them which gave me an upgraded suite for the price of a standard room.Check-in was very rapid and I was especially appreciative of the check-in clerk, Elenora. I was having a problem with my debit card - it turned out the company had put a temporary block on it for suspicion of identity theft! Fortunately I got it all straightened out, and Elenora swiped that card about 10 different times over the course of an hour without even frowning. That takes alot of patience - you don't often see much of that in the customer service industry anymore. Thanks again, Elenora!The property differs slightly from the Decatur location as all of the corridors and buildings are outside vs. being enclosed. The decor of the rooms is a little more Mediterranean vs. southwestern, as the Decatur location is. The suite (I believe it was a Standard King Suite) was very spacious, two televisions, extra cold air conditioner, very good water pressure, and lots of closet space. The casino was great as always and the Sourdough Cafe was teriffic. Be sure to check out the $2.99 Steak and Egg special, it's the best you'll ever had and has won several awards in Las Vegas magazines.Overall, a teriffic stay and I'd recommend it to everyone. Remember, you won't get the glitz and glamour of the Strip in some of these off-strip casino hotels, but it's been proven that places like these are far superior in customer service and higher casino payouts. The room prices and friendly employees can't be beat. Give it a try!"
34,279,"Jun 30 2006	Terrible	Following is a list of overall impressions:1) The facade is under construction, making it difficult to get around the front of the hotel/casino. Trucks and workers often impeded clientele traffic.2) We had a heck of a time finding the hotel check in desk. Only one sign hinted at its location, then we finally had to ask the valet guy.3) Overall, the exterior is filthy. The sidewalks are ugly with air conditioning, gum and grime stains. Some portions of the exterior were repainted, with overspray on the walkways (no tarps used), The walls and air conditioning units were grimy.4) We booked a &quot;deluxe&quot; suite with a king bed. There's one big, stark room with a tiny TV in the amoir. Grimy old carpet and dingy walls greeted us. The &quot;ball/hook&quot; door lock was broken off. The bedroom had another tiny TV/amoir, with a fair mattress, and the sink (single) RIGHT NEXT to the bed. The pillows were small, and the linens were stingy (only two bath, hand and wash towels).5) We called the front desk to get some additional pillows around 6PM, and no one ever came. When we called again to inquire, they said &quot;housekeeping&quot; was hard to reach. No one ever called back, and we never got our pillows.6) The bathroom fan did not work. Use your imagination after an evening out eating.7) Service at the Sourdough cafe was abysmally slow. Even after the restaurant manager visited our table to &quot;check&quot; on us, our meals took another 10 minutes to arrive.Bottom line, this place is the WORST hotel I've visited in over 10 years (Motel 6 does a better job), and I travel extensively. We felt unsafe walking the grounds gazing upon what looked like gang bangers. Avoid this place at all cost."
35,279,"Jun 9 2006	AZ Charlies Boulder we will be back Next Year	This is only our 2nd annual trip to Las Vegas (Mom, Aunt and I). First hotel we stayed at, was AWFUL. So yes Arizona Charlies Boulder was a welcome step up. We had a nice deluxe room which was plenty big enough for us. We loved that the sink and mirror are separate from the shower. Since 3 women trying to get ready at once can be a scary thing. We had an excellent spot, parked right next to elevator and went right up to our room. Great view of the Pool which was nice the one day we got a chance to get in. We ate at the Buffet and the Sourdough Cafe, must say my preference was the Cafe, not the Buffet. Our first impression was not the best because the check in lady had NO Personality but every staff member during our stay after was very friendly, helpful and had a smile for us. You definitely need a car if you are staying here and wanting to go to the Strip or anywhere else. The only downside we did discover was the carpet was stained in some places but the room and bathroom itself looked clean and maintained. We are already planning our 3rd trip and Arizona Charlie's Boulder (East) will definitely be on our list to stay at. For the price and the location, it is a great deal...After reading all the reviews here, I was abit afraid but for the price for 3 of us, it couldn't be beat and thought OK lets do it. I am glad I didn't let the mixed reviews detour me from booking a room and staying here. Also, lastly, the air conditioner in our room worked great which is a big must have."
36,279,"Apr 11 2006 	Not Great But not THAT bad	We stayed here only because it was the only room we could find when my BF had to attend a convention on last minute notice. Almost all the rooms were sold out in Las Vegas for the days of the convention. The few that were available were going for $400 plus, so this seemed like a good deal for $39 (through hotwire) a night during a busy convention week. We stayed Tuesday-Friday.LOCATIONThis is on Boulder Highway, far off the strip, and they do not have shuttle service to the strip. We had a car, so location wasn't that big of deal, but don't stay here unless you have a car. Boulder Station and Sam's Town are on either side (long walk or short drive).CHECK-INWe checked in about 11:30 AM. The clerk first told us they were completely booked, and all we could get was a double room, and no rooms were ready yet. We slipped her a $20 and she found a King/double smoking suite that was ready for check-in.Note that the front of the hotel is under construction, so you need to go through the casino entrance and check in there.ROOMThe room was barely adequate, but can't really complain for the price we got. First, the good. It was spacious. It was close to the pool, but looked out on the parking lot and the 7-11 next door, but was pretty quiet with little road noise. Fairly clean, with a stain here and there on the carpet. Also the windows open up, which is nice for fresh air and a breeze. It had two rooms. A large front room with a double bed w/end table, sofa w/end table, coffee table, armoire with drawers, and small tv (reception was clear for us, but only 8 channels, no HBO, etc. you could order movies.) The second room was a bit tight with a King bed, a corner unit with another small tv, and a sink stand. It also had a large walk-in closet. I found the bed to be fairly hard, and the pillows were very uncomfortable. The bathroom was tiny with a toilet, and a tub/shower combo. It was dingy and old with some mildew in the tile caulking. Shower pressure was ok, but not great. Shampoo and lotion for products.Be aware that the rooms have no amenities except for an alarm clock. There is no hairdryer, iron, ironing board (although i guess you can request them, although they don't make this known, but i did see one housekeeper removing one from a room), coffee maker, fridge or microwave. There is only dial-up internet access, with a 75 cent per connection fee. Also, there was only one ice maker that I could find and it was at the opposite end of the complex, there was no ice maker near the pop machine at our end. THE GROUNDSThe units all surround and open up to a courtyard. There is landscaping and paths to the casino, with a courtyard sitting area toward the casino end of the courtyard, a fountain in the middle area, and a pool area w/hot tub at the far end. There is always security around on bikes, so the grounds seemed safe.We used the pool twice and it was very uncrowded considering the place was full. They have lots of deck chairs that you can use in the sun or in a shaded area they have. The hot tub wasn't very hot, but was ok. (I noticed the reviewer below said there was no pool, but I think she must have been in the wrong area of the courtyard, because there most definitely is a pool).CASINOWe were in the unit farthest away from the Casino, but I didn't find the walk through the courtyard that long to get there; I have walked farther to get to the casino in large strip hotels. The casino was fairly small by las vegas standards. But gaming is cheap and it was never super crowded. Video Poker makes up the majority of the machines. There aren't that many tables, but I rarely saw them all full. We won some, and were up a couple hundred on our second day there, but managed to lose most of our gambling money by the end. Cocktail service was good and friendly. Lots of locals seemed to game here, and they were all friendly and fun.RESTAURANTSThere is the Wild West Buffet, The Sourdough Cafe, The Yukon Grille Steakhouse, and a deli for sandwiches and fast-food type stuff. The prices for food are extremely reasonable, and friendly service.We ate at the Sourdough Cafe for breakfast several times and a couple other meals. The ham and egg special for $2.79 is huge. They also had a steak and egg special for $2.99, the steak was a little tough, but had good flavor. My bf's favorite was the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes he had one night for $4.99.We also tried the Yukon Grille Steakhouse one night, it was reasonable, but underwhelming. I had the small filet medium rare, which was overcooked and tasteless, and my bf had prime rib, which he didn't enjoy at all (I have a feeling you could do the prime rib in the studio cafe for $7.99 and would get the same thing). Each entree was about $18. With a bottle of wine, salads, two entrees, and a shared dessert, the total was only $75, but I would rather spend more for really good steak. Overall, I wouldn't stay here again unless circumstances required it. But if you are doing las vegas on a tight budget, it is not a bad value for your money."
37,279,"Mar 17 2006 	RUN FOR THE HILLS	Please do not stay here.I live in Minnesota and my sister is in California. I am getting married in Vegas this April and found it just a little too difficult to plan EVERYTHING with out seeing anything. My sister and I went to Vegas to check out this hotel and the wedding location. This hotel was recommended to my by a friend. I was told it was great for he money. My ENTIRE family is planning to attend the wedding obviously including my mother in a WC. Now on to the bad stuff.First of all the hotel was under construction. The front of the building was missing! You couldn't even figure out where to park to check in. Valet was no help at all. Check in was another story but it took way too long. One of our first observations was that the hotel was NOT connected to the casino which is something we definitely did not want. Once inside it's your typical casino but SO SMOKEY, and Im a smoker!!! I could hardly stand it. Our room also smelled so bad. In the middle of the night it smelled like somebody was smoking right in our room. Keep in mind I had already booked 30 rooms for my wedding in April. As we are on our way to the room we noticed there was concrete where the pool was supposed to be. We did not feel that this hotel had adequate accommodations for people in WC. There was an elevator but all the buttons were broken and I really do not think it was large enough to hold a WC, luggage, and another person. This was by far the most unacceptable situations. We try to make the best of it, for the night.Do not believe the pictures on the website. No pool. There is a total of 9 tables and 1 roulette table. One the website it looks like the tables go on for miles. If you like to play tables keep this in mind.The Next MorningWe realize there is no coffee pot, no ironing board! Apparently you have to special order them. We I highly doubt they have 30 WORKING coffee pots and ironing boards at there hotel.We have an appt at 11 to pick out my flowers. After showering in a tub that made you feel that you 100lb body was going to break through the floor we were ready to dry our hair. The outlet blew up our hair dryer!!! We had to run to a Big Lots with wet hair to buy a new hair dryer. Can you imagine if that happened to me on my wedding day?Needless to say we checked out that morning with nowhere to stay. It did not feel safe. Everyone would have to rent a car as there is no airport shuttle or strip shuttle. It did not look like my mom could get around easy and it was NO place for kids. I would never lay down my baby niece on the bed with a fear she would be poked with a needle. YES, it was that bad. It was a step up from a crack house.Luckily the wedding location was beautiful, Kudos Rainbow Gardens and Thank you to Ron at Bloomers for suggesting the hotel we are now all staying at Palace Station."
38,279,"Mar 7 2006	Run to Another Hotel!	We stayed with my daughter's soccer team and it was awful from the beginning. We got there late Friday night and when we checked we assumed we were getting a non smoking room but when we went to our room , it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches in the room. The TV was from the 1980's and had only a few channels and ghost image on one of the channel's. Try watching Jay Leno with a ghost image of him in the TV. I called to change room and the from desk stated that no room were available until the next day. I stated to the from desk that I wanted a non smoking room and the from assured me they would be room available. I called three different times , the next day and they told me to call later. That the room were not availAble yet. I went downstairs, by elevator which has no up button , you can only press the button to down The front desk person got a non smoking room for me. I walked back to the room with the smell of fertilizer and view of dead grass. The suite's bathroom was the size of a closet and i had to dry off in the bathtub for more room. Need I say more. Save your money and go somewhere else."
39,279,"Jan 3 2006	I love Arizona Charlie!!	The only thing I found wrong with this hotel was the distance to the Strip. I stayed here with a friends family, the grandma had booked all the rooms so we had no choice. I later found out the rooms were 29 dollars a night, you can't beat that! I stayed in one of their suites, it had been recently remodeled. It was spotless, spacious, and comfortable. Breakfast everyday in the Sourdough Cafe, everything tasted fine. The casino served it's purpose. The bartender was friendly as well as the cocktail waitresses. I didn't play on any of the tables but that's only because I'm cheap. It cost about 20 dollars to get a cab ride to or from the strip, the only drawback. All in all I would recommend it to anyone!!!"
40,279,"Sep 20 2005	Better than I expected	My husband, daughter and I stayed at Arizona Charlie's Boulder Hotel and Casino September 4th, for 1 night. Our flight arrived very late Sunday night and we needed an inexpensive place to stay. I was very skeptical due to the reviews that I have read, but we decided to take a chance. I booked the room on the AC website, $49.00 for a Deluxe Suite King/Double. The hotel is undergoing rennovation on the outside. The room we received was very clean, but in need of an upgrade. The front room had a double bed, TV, and sitting area with a sofa. The bedroom had a King size bed and another TV,which was a bonus. The bathroom was small, clean but did have old fixtures. The hotel is more like a motel setting, the rooms could not be reached through the casino, all on the outside as best as I could tell. Check in was very quick but, the lady at the front desk did advise us to make sure we checked out by 11:00 AM. The beds were comfortable and there was not alot of noise. I was concened that there would be alot of noisy people and car doors slamming with the rooms facing the outside. Check out was easy and since we prepaid there was not a hassle. We were pleasatly surprised and got a good deal for the money."
41,279,"Sep 1 2005	Perfectly nice motel	I just returned from a 1-night stay at AZ Charlie's Boulder. I was a little worried after reading some postings for this, but I had a nice experience. I arrived before check-in -- around 11:30 am -- but the clerk was nice enough to find me a clean room -- and by the pool, which I requested. The room was basic - 2 beds, bathroom with noisy fan, vanity/sink area, TV, table &amp; chairs. Plenty of hangers in the closet area too. The property's kind of like an apartment complex -- lots of units and a pool area in the middle. I spent about an hour by the pool and, besides being open to guests only, I saw a bike security man ride by at least 3 times. Makes you feel safe. I ate at the breakfast buffet -- no complaints for $4.60. I got my fruit, coffee, juice, eggs and oatmeal. They even have an omelet station. And let's not forget, Charlie's is CHEAP. I would stay there again. It's very convenient to be able to check in and out very quickly, unlike the huge hotels with long lines."
42,279,"Jul 14 2005	What the hell!!!!!!	Paid $49.99 for a deluxe,completely reurbished suite.Yes - probably 1933!What a dive.Checked out after 6 hours and went to Sunset Station as all others were full -weekend.That was about 2000% better.Give this place a very wide berth - lurking in those carpets and linen are bacteria that Grissom on CSI could spend a lifetime studying.The only place worse than this must be a Turkish prison.Their buffet is worse than the throwaways in the overflowing dumpsters outside."
43,279,"Apr 29 2005	Nice off-strip hotel w/Casino close to transportation etc.	We stayed most recently at Arizona Charlie's Boulder in mid-January 2005. The property has standard rooms as well as mini suites. The property underwent a rennovation in 2004 and the rooms are nice, new southwest pastel decor, new furnishings, the bathrooms had tile or marbl-ey type counters.We've stayed in both. The standard rooms are what you'd expect - two beds, bathroom, TV, side chars and table, no coffeemakers or mini fridges. The suites we have stayed in have two rooms, with a door in between, 1 bed in each room, as well as 1 TV in each room. There is only 1 bathroom in the suites we have stayed in.ACB rooms are spread out on the property in 6 or 7 separate buildings. The higher the number of the building, the closer the building is to the casino. There is a pool and spa as well as a guest Laundromat. All of the rooms face open air corridors. It's never been a problem for us, but you need to note that if someone wanted to, they could walk off the street and up to anyone's room door. Again we've never had a problem; there is ample security and a bike patrol.ACB is on Boulder Highway and it lies between Sam's Town and Boulder Station. We've walked to Sam's Town from there, but Boulder looks a little far. There's a 7-11 next to the hotel and a gas station/convenience store across the street as well as a Wells Fargo Branch. A couple of minute's drive in either direction will bring you to various fast food places, drug stores and supermarkets.There is a small casino with a 24-hour Bingo parlor (that's why we go there), a standard 24-hour coffee shop, a buffet that's small but surprisingly good, and a higher-end steakhouse that we've never been to. Sometimes the hotel runs a shuttle service to other properties, ask when you get to the hotel.The staff is so-so, they can be friendly, but they've also been brusque especially at check-in. Cocktail servers, waitstaff, etc. are always nice.All in all, if you want to have a chance to gamble and have a decent room without the crowds, this is the place to be."
44,279,"Feb 22 2005	Mixed Feelings	We stayed at this hotel Feb 18-21, 2005 and paid a hefty $60/night. This was, however, the cheapest we could find over a holiday weekend in Vegas. First the good points: We stayed 3 people (1 couple and 1 single) and the room set-up was great. The room has plenty of room for lots of people -- it has 2 rooms a bed in each and a couch. With an air mattress you could easily sleep 6. Beware of the beds, though -- calling htem even a double is being generous.Now the bad -- big time electrical issues!! Every time we turned on the light in the bathroom, we got zapped -- and not just a small zap! Our room only got made up once in 3 days -- despite calls to the front desk and they never did send anyone to fix the electrical issue.If you don't have a car, forget it. This is a good 20 minute drive from the strip with traffic and no shuttle is available. Hated the lunch buffet -- it was terrible. The casino is almost all slots. Not sure if we'll stay there again. Pay the extra money and go somewhere else."
45,279,"Jul 17 2004	You Get What You Pay For	We booked Arizona Charlie's because of the special room rate of $29.00. So for that price we were willing to be happy with whatever we got. However, our stay was somewhat disappointing. It would have been okay in an average city, but not for Las Vegas. First of all, potential visitors should know that the rooms are nice enough but they have no amenities. By that I mean, the room we stayed in had no hair blowdryer, about 8 channels on the tv, only two towels, and a noisy air conditioner. We asked for a toothbrush from the front desk and were told we would have to buy one in the gift shop. The bathroom was smaller than average and had a very loud ventilation fan. The rooms are in separate buildings away from the casino so you have a somewhat lenghy walk to get to the casino. (Not that lengthy walks are unusual in Vegas). The casino is relatively small and the odor of cigarrette smoke is quite obvious. (An odor which tainted all of our clothes). There is no shuttle service to or from the airport or strip. The pool is small. They have three beautiful outdoor fountains in an outdoor courtyard but they were sitting dry and idle.We booked our rooms online and did not know until we checked in that there was an additional $2.50/night energy charge AND a $35 deposit (which is returned if you don't incur any additional charges during your stay.) Basically the ONLY reason you should want to even visit Arizona Charlie's East is for the food. The quality and pricing is unmatched anywhere in Vegas!! My advice is to stay somewhere else, but drive over to Charlie's for the meals!"
46,279,"Apr 28 2004	Way Too Smokey!	When you walk into Arizona Charlie's from the outside, the first thing that greets you is loads of cigarette smoke. Wow! They should have a sign that tells people the upstairs is non-smoking rather than have customers endure the smoke. My clothes &amp; hair reeked of smoke when we left. We also didn't win even a nickel in the slots! I think they need to update their ventilation system and make the slots looser."
47,279,Apr 18 2004	Good Buffet	My husband and I stayed at Sam's Town and asked a guest there where to eat breakfast. He said they always go to Arizona Charlie's. It's cheap and good. He was right. We were quite surprised that the breakfast buffet was only $4.29 and it was good. We went back the next day but was too late for breakfast and the lunch buffet was being served and it was good. The room was full of customers too. The first day a group of 4 waitresses were arguing there in the restaurant but the next day our waitress (not there the day before) was very nice and helpful. The bathrooms on the same floor as the buffet were not clean though.
48,279,"Nov 14 2003	Mixed Bag at Arizona Charlies	The room was okay, bed was comfy. The shower was antiquated and hard to get decent water pressure or prolonged heat from it. However, the staff for the hotel and the casino are very friendly and their Sunday Champaigne Brunch at $6.99 was supurb for the money. Overall, good for the price."
49,279,Aug 3 2006 	Arizona Charie's war super
1,284,Mar 22 2005 	Great Value for money	We've just returned from Vegas and stumbled across the Aztec following a reccommendation from reservations at the Stratosphere. We just happened to pick the busiest week in the Vegas calendar and all the hotels apart from the Aztec were full. All I can say is it's great value for money. The food in the restaurant is cooked fresh to order and has the 'home cooked' taste as opposed to the plastic meals served up in other places. The bar is packed full of characters and with happy hours prices of 75c for a Bud what more do you want. We were in Vegas for 8 days and split our time here and the Stratosphere when they had availability. The rooms are adequate with no frills and great value at $59
2,284,"Oct 12 2004	I stayed here back in 2000 - avoid like the plague	I just started using tripadvisor.com, and although I stayed here in 2000, I thought I should write to say it was really bad. Rooms disgusting. Unless they are under new management, do not stay there. You definitely get what you pay for, and it was very cheap."
3,284,"Feb 21 2004	Ok when Vegas is booked up	I stayed at the Aztec in February of 2003. There was absolutely no other rooms available on the strip for less than $140 per night. I did not expect much by looking at the outside, but the room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and I felt safe. I spend very little time in the room and this was all I need for the appropriate price. You can do better during the slow times in Vegas, but this is an excellent deal when the rooms are gone.Happy traveling. Satisfied guest"
4,284,Jan 1 2004	was great for the price	Had a blast kinda of a cheap hotel but thats exactally what I wanted Ind I was so &quot;excited&quot; about being home in las vegas That I hardley noticed I was smashes
5,284,"Dec 26 2003	bad place-good slots	jan. 2003Me and a friend, check Inn. because its 10 feet from the strip. rooms cold has ice. no heat. small enough for one person. they say single 25.00 night. its was 39.50 night. old motel style room. no pool. bar and resturant. slowest service I've ever had, in vegas. the only thing good where the slots. wow $100 on nickles. also high crime area. watch your pocket. far from all the major casino's."
6,284,"Sep 15 2002	give this one a miss	We saw a sign advertising cheap rooms so we checked in here for two nights.A typical seedy motel set-up, bad air conditioner (hotter inside then out), typical motel room set-up with very cramped bathroom facilities.Dubious cliental( I suspect rent by the hour)but we never felt unsafe or ...in the wrong place...For a few dollars more we could have stayed across the road at the Stratosphere which I assume would have been a better deal.Located at the far end of the strip it is a long way to the big casinos like New York New York, Ballagio etc.We felt safe walking at night though, no problemns there."
1,288,Oct 19 2003	Highly reccomend! We are repeat guests...	While some of the &quot;guests&quot; are full-time residents
2,288,Oct 8 2003	You've got to be kidding	We checked in and checked out within 30 minutes. Only wish had we had read tripadvisor prior to booking. Used hotels website. WRONG MOVE...Food is disgusting. We went to graba bite after a long drive and found no salvation. Unlike the claims
3,288,Sep 23 2003	Mislead	Mislead - old folks home...not hotel. Poor service at check in - lost my reservation which was made online. luckily had confirmation with me.gross - found 2 cockroaches in room - smelled musty. Staff was nice but no one seemed to know what to do - everything seemed to be in disarray -waste of money - we checked out and went to mandalay bay - same price for incredible service!	
4,288,Jul 24 2003	Retirement Home	Advertised as a resort off the strip. FAR off the Strip
1,291,Nov 12 2009 	Disappointed	We have stayed in a lot of Best Western Hotels and this was probably the worst. We were given a room behind the kitchen and the banging and dropping started at 6a.m. That was not good as we were staying out late.. There saving energy system was bad as we could not get the air condintioning to work and we got a dribble of water from the shower head. We were told they had an hourly bus to the strip and that was not true. So we did figure out public transportation but they have not information on that. We would not stay there again.
2,291,"Oct 27 2009 	Small rooms with fleas	We stayed at this hotel a few years ago and it was nice. This time however is was horrible. We asked for a room on the first floor because we had a flight at 5:00 am and didnt want to disturb other guests. We were given a room on the 3rd floor and as far from the elevator as you can get. We had already waited 1 hour past the check in time and they said it would be another hour until a room would be ready. So we stayed , we were unable to sleep all night for the ice machine was right next to our room and made ice all night. To top it off my wife was bitten by fleas or something on neck and shoulders. Then on check out they over charged us and have yet to respond to us about it."
3,291,Sep 29 2009 	Wonderfull Stay	Hotel was nice although minor improvements can be done. staff was very helpfull to our needs. Price was excellent..
4,291,"Sep 21 2009 	Clean room. Bring your own pillows.	Close and convenient to airport, and hotel offers free shuttle service.Basic breakfast - bread, mini muffins, cereal, plain oatmeal, hot waffles, coffee, tea, juice.6 1/2&quot; high decorative pillows look nice, but uncomfortable. Could not get replacement pillows from front desk as housekeeping was closed at 10pm. Stuffed some towels in the pillowcase.Room was nicely decorated and clean."
5,291,"Sep 2 2009 	Probably would have been better if it hadn't been for room location	I booked this room with an employee rate so I'm not sure what the regular rate would be. Stayed in a room with a king bed. Room was clean and had the basics. There was a minor maintenance issue with one of the outlets being loose so that any cord that was plugged in it would fall out. Was kind of inconvenient. The only major gripe I had was that I was placed in a room right next to the housekeeping/breakfast storage room. Early in the morning, I was awakened to rather loud clanking and banging of breakfast items being either cleared away or put out, I'm not sure. And it was LOUD. I think I heard someone else go to the front desk and complain about it. Why you would put a room there is beyond me. Other than that, my stay was satisfactory. The staff was okay- they weren't overly friendly but I gues they did their job. The location was pretty close to the Strip. If you have a car-great, if not, then it might be kind of a walk."
6,291,"Aug 4 2009 	Would Stay Again ... And Probably Get Better Service Next Time	We chose this hotel because we were transiting Las Vegas overnight and it was so close to the airport (5 mins by Best Western hotel shuttle). This is basically a budget hotel that serves its purpose and is reasonable value. The reception and other areas of the hotel are quite tired looking but the rooms appear to have been recently renovated and were comfortable, clean and quiet and had all the expected facilities. Breakfast was quite good for a budget hotel. Our only complaint is that the service of the check-in staff when we arrived at 11pm was poor and unresponsive - for example, our access card did not work for 30 mins after check-in but the staff were very slow in trying to resolve this. Overall though, we would stay here again."
7,291,"Jul 28 2009	Feels like home	We had to go travel to Las Vegas on the spare of the moment to visit a sick relative. After reading lots of reviews from pass customers I chose Best Western McCarran Inn and was not disappointed. The room was very clean and staff very friendly and helpful. There was a problem with their internet system...too slow...however, I must say the reviews were not wrong about the great breakfast waiting for us in the morning. Overall, I would not hesitate to stay there again."
8,291,"Jun 29 2009 	pretty quiet near airport	We stayed here one night before catching an early flight out of Veags. The room was your average hotel room. It was clean and the bed linens were nice. For being so close to the airport I thought it was quiet. I didn't hear any planes, just some people/doors in the hallway a few times. The man at the desk was very nice and even offered to print our boarding passes for us. I would stay here again for the value."
9,291,"May 26 2009 	Service Location Convienence at a moderate price.	Staff is knowledgeable, enthusiastic and willing to assist with all your needs. Rooms are clean and well presented, simple yet roomy. Hotel is quaint and friendly."
10,291,"May 13 2009 	Convenient Location - Nothing bad to say	We arrived on a late flight and were really happy to have chosen this place as our first stay. It's close to the airport, it's clean, it's cheap ($70 in Vegas), there's even breakfast. I honestly have nothing bad to say. We weren't disturbed by any noises. Ok, this isn't a romantic place, but very good price versus quality. Make sure to reserve in advance, this place was fully booked."
11,291,"May 7 2009 	After stay service... TERRIBLE!!!	Left 2 sport jackets and 4 shirts (on top of the jackets) on the bed in my room (my error). Called hotel upon arriving home, and lady said we found both the jackets and shirts. She promised to send articles to me via FedEx...However I only received jackets... no shirts. Called about missing shirts and received nothing but a lot of rhetoric about how honest the housekeeping people were and was told that the housekeeper only found the jackets. I asked the lady how they could have possible only found the jackets and not the shirts since the shirts were on top of the jackets. More token rhetoric with no results.If you make the error of staying at the Best Western McCarran, be sure to watch your valuables and whatever you do..... DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND!!!"
12,291,"Mar 21 2009 	I couldn't recommend this hotel	We stayed here for one night because we had an early flight out of Vegas and wanted to be near the airport. What we failed to realise is that the bottom end of the Strip is near the airport, there's no need to stay at an 'airport hotel'. The room was nice enough, but the ice machine in the hallway was clearly audible all night, as was a loud buzzing from the hotel sign in the parking lot. For the rate, it was not good value and I couldn't recommend it."
13,291,"Mar 10 2009 	Personable genuine helpful prompt attentive	Catherine, April and Mike were probably the most personable, genuine staff members I have had the pleasure to do business with while staying at a hotel on business. Vibrations were not that vague, shallow politeness you so often feel from staff members at other hotels. Staff members who has seen to many guests come and go and have become callous and indifferent. Not here at this Best Western. These people showed real interest in a conversation and all were intune to the most sutble of humor( they laughed at my jokes). To misqoute the great Ed Sullivan when talking about Elvis, &quot; These are nice kids&quot;. And the rooms and breakfast were nice too:)"
14,291,Feb 12 2009 	Great Location for fly out of Mc Carran	Clean and great staff. some noise from airport but not real bad. not far from strip. would stay again.
15,291,"Feb 1 2009 	Basic hotel just off the Strip	Our hearts sank when we entered the lobby which is rather gloomy, but to be fair, our room was good, clean with a king size bed. It had all the amenities we needed and expected. Bed was very good. We slept very comfortably. You do get aircraft noise and also we were at the back of the hotel where there is a bus depot. A couple of times we heard buses reversing. Overall, though, it was an ok hotel which was cheaper than staying on the strip. They do a shuttle to the strip and the airport. We had a car so did not use this. There are public transport buses that run down Tropicana Avenue that you can also use.Breakfast was included so we had this a couple of times (bagels to toast and waffles to make) but generally we just got a cup of tea and went out to the breakfast buffets at the big hotels on the strip. I would consider this hotel again, but if we did not have a car, it is probably worth paying extra to stay in one of the strip hotels. That way you are not reliant on waiting for public transport or the shuttle."
16,291,"Jan 3 2009 	Good for family - Accessible Indian Restaurent	Staff was cooperative.Breakfast is good &amp; sufficient.Very near to airport. Very near to las vegas public transport, Bus number 108. This bus goes to airport, Statosphere, India Palace on E Twain ave.Good for family.I got it for $55/pd on AAA.Shuttle service to MGM grand is good.Wireless internet connection was also good, also they have one computer in lobby.Cons - Hotel Shuttle from airport is not avaibale after 11 am till afternoon some time. Out flight reached at 12 noon, so we have to pay for airport shuttle. This is not mentoned on BW website.Another option from airport is take bus 108, buy a day pass for 5$. Get down at Tropicana St. and walk towards Paradise rd for 5 mins. This is a cheaper option. This bus pass can be used for any bus route in las vegas.  If you want to go to India Palace Restaurent, catch Bus 108 on Swenson St and get down at E Twain Ave and walk 5 min towards paradise rd. You will find India Palace on left side. Overall satisfied with Hotel."
17,291,"Dec 25 2008 	Comfortable but noisy	My husband and I spent one night here on arrival in Las Vegas. I chose the hotel because it was close to the airport and offered a courtesy shuttle. Our flight was 2-1/2 hours late arriving, so I was a little worried that the shuttle might no longer be available, but apparently it runs till quite late in the evening. We waited about 20 minutes for it to arrive at the airport; the ride to the hotel takes only 5-10 minutes.There is no restaurant in the hotel, and there doesn't seem to be anything within easy walking distance, but there is an order-in service. Menus are provided in the room. We didn't try this, but we did have the breakfast included in the room rate. It's all self-service, with pre-prepared items like waffle batter from a dispenser and partially cooked french toast waiting to be toasted, along with staples like cereal, bread and pastries. It's an okay start to the day that would be better if it didn't involve so much styrofoam. Time to switch to something more environmentally responsible.The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows, but we were woken early by departing aircraft. Our room turned out to be very close to the end of the runway. Given that the hotel appeared relatively unoccupied, I can't understand why the front desk would give anyone a room so close to the runway. Clearly, there are other rooms quite a bit further away, so if you consider staying here, be sure to ask for a quiet room. We passed through Las Vegas a week later at the end of our vacation and spent the night at the Candlewood Suites, just a couple of blocks along Paradise, and we heard no aircraft at all, so perhaps the Best Western just doesn't have much soundproofing."
18,291,"Dec 9 2008 	Absolute worst stay since 2006.	1. Keycards wouldn't work. Not one set, not two sets, not three sets. Not if I tried them, not if any of four employees tried them. But master keycards worked. No employee believed me about keys until they tried them, and once they didn't work for them they passed me off to another employee.2. No offer of another room. Dark, dingy halls and entry area.3. Didn't tell me air conditioner needed WORKING keycard to operate. Room hot.4. No screen on window on a first floor room. Window hidden from view by brick wall, so anyone hiding there wouldn't be seen. Great for sleeping soundly.5. Very nicely furnished room.6. Jets overhead every minute or so for nearly four hours. And I mean only a few hundred feet above the room.7. Worst of all, I chose this hotel because I stayed here years ago. Before the airport changed the takeoff pattern. What a mistake."
19,291,"Nov 29 2008 	Waited an hour for the airport shuttle pool wasn't heated	We had to wait almost an hour at the airport for the shuttle, even though the hotel is only 5 mins from the airport. They told us it would only take 20 mins for the shuttle to arrive. Had we known it was going to be an hour, we would have taken a taxi. We could have walked the distance in much less time!When we complained about the wait, the front desk didn't care about the delay nor was a manager available.Also, being from Canada, we weren't worried about an outdoor pool in November, as long as it was heated. Unfortunately, it is definately not heated and is very, very cold. Don't plan on using it except in summer. I mentioned this at the front desk and they said it was heated, but refused to come and feel the water or measure the temperature - it was very, very cold and definately not heated.Finally, the phone in our room didn't work, so they offered to change the room, but it wasn't worth the hassle."
20,291,"Oct 21 2008	Very nice	We stayed here on the night we arrived in Vegas and another night the day we left the States two weeks later. Both experiences were fine. The staff here is very friendly (even in the early hours of the morning!)The breakfast was a nice standard hotel breakfast and included a waffle maker, which was a nice touch although I didn't have one. Juices, coffees, fruit, bread for toasting, a few cereal options.Our first night was on the side facing away from the airport and facing the pool. Toiletries, which the hotel website doesn't mention, lovely fanned out towels and flannels (I'm impressed by little attentions to detail like that - they don't have to, but it makes a difference). We heard no planes.The second night we were on the airport facing side where you can see the tails of the planes moving round! We could hear planes - lots of them (and later saw the hotel from the plane!), but I guess they fly out in different directions at different times. Hearing planes can't be a complaint. The hotel is literally at the end of the runway - what do you expect?! It doens't keep you awake either. They run a shuttle service to and from the hotel/aiport, which we didn't use, but it's easy to get to the rental car place from this location, so it was well worth it.I reckon we had a better room as well with faux-suede foot thingy at the end of the bed, better mattress, better shower curtain (!), faux-silk valanace and a headboard.I don't know that I'd want to be based here for a week if I was just seeing The Strip, but, again, they have a shuttle, which was explained to us, and it seemed very easy.I've stayed in another Vegas hotel and it was nice to be in one where you can't hear that wretched ching ching ching noise!"
21,291,"Sep 30 2008 	Nice room nice breakfast	The room was nicely appointed and the breakfast better than most hotel breakfasts. The staff was friendly. I appreciated the free shuttle service to and from the airport and the MGM Grand (the Strip). The only downside was the too-soft mattress, but it seemed like replacement mattresses were just off the corridor.A great place to stay the departure or arrival days in Las Vegas, when you're there mainly for the airport."
22,291,"Jul 2 2008 	Quiet and friendly hotel	We stayed 4 nights in this little hotel, not far from de Strip and we loved it. It is just 3 minutes from the airport, but we did not hear one airplane and slept very well. De rooms are very clean and good and the staff at the reception is very helpfull. Fine is the free shuttle service to and from the airport and to and from the Strip (untill midnight). The quality of the breakfast is good too. Walking from the hotel to the Strip takes 15 minutes. If you like to go to downtown, take bus 108 , the busstop is 5 minutes by foot from the hotel. Busstop for the local bus to the strip is 2 minutes by foot from the hotel. So it is very easy to go around without a car. Should stay there again. Recommended. You have a lot for the price you pay!!"
23,291,"Jun 19 2008 	A perfect place to stay!	Two of us stayed at the Best Western McCarran for two nights. The staff was welcoming and wanted to help us in any way possible. Our room was standard with no frills but it was clean and the beds were very comfortable. The free shuttle took us to and from the airport and the Strip. All we had to do was call for it. The breakfast was more than adequate: juice, coffee, muffins, and French toast plus cereals. Because of our departure time, a shuttle driver came in very, very early to take us to the airport on his own time. This was our first trip to Las Vegas; we were really here on a stopover and wanted to experience the Strip so arranged to stay an extra day. The motel was a perfect location and we were treated royally. If we're out that way again, we will definitely make arrangements to stay at the Best Western."
24,291,"May 12 2008	Good hotel	Good value for Las Vegas, nice decorated rooms, perfect working air-condition, huge comfortable beds, huge parking, small but well located swimming pool, with sun beds, and sun since 7am. Tasty continental breakfast, computer in lobby. Worth spent money. Definitely will come back."
25,291,"May 6 2008 	Good Motel	I stayed at this motel during a major convention based upon price, reviews, and the fact that this motel offered a free shuttle service to the convention center. The motel was clean, the rooms were nice, the staff was good, but if you're counting on the shuttle for transportation, it might be more at their convenience than yours and depending on the number of users, times might vary. The pool was unusable two of the five days we were there. But all in all, it was a good stay and things worked out."
26,291,Apr 23 2008 	Good price	We stayed in this hotel for one night as we had an early flight to catch the next morning.The free shuttle to the airport every 30 minutes is a great service.The rooms and beds are large and very clean and comfortable.The Continental brekkie in the lobby is perfect and very tasty.Overall a very good experience.One note though...I wouldn't stay in this hotel if my main objective in Vegas was to be on the Strip. Stay in one of the hotels there if that is the main reason for your stay. It'll make things a lot easier to be in the middle of things.
27,291,"Jan 5 2008	desert jewel	I stayed at the BW over the New Year's weekend. The price was unbeatable, and the 2 mile walk to The Strip was not bad. There is a free shuttle that drops you off at the MGM or the Hard Rock, up until 7pm. It will even pick you up, w/ just 1 phone call away. The continental breakfast was perfect. Nice juices to choose from, and the bagels, muffins, and croissants really hit the spot. The room was clean and comfortable. This was a great hotel for some one wanting to go to Vegas on a budget, and doesn't mind staying off the Strip. I would stay here again.BTW---just a little background on my stays in Vegas....I've stayed at the Wynn, Flamingo, Caesar's, Bally's, Mandalay, Terribles, Planet Hollywood/ Aladdin, Stratosphere, Paris, Veneitan, Rio, and the Bellagio.I've seen rooms at Imperial Palace, Treasure Island, and the Orleans."
28,291,"Dec 1 2007 	Not a bad option near the Strip	I chose the Best Western McCarran as it was reasonably priced (for a Saturday night), and had free shuttles to the airport &amp; the Strip.Both of the shuttles work on a 'request' basis, whereby you need to call and let them know that you need a pick-up. That said, it probably only took 10 minutes after my call from the airport, which wasn't too bad.The hotel is a good 10-15 minute walk off the strip, along a busy highway, so the hourly free shuttle is the best way of getting to the action. It drops off outside the MGM Grand, which is also the pick-up point for the return trip.On a busy night like Saturday, it did seem a bit unnecessary to have to call for a pick-up to and from the Strip, as I'm sure that there were people waiting every hour (and phones are few and far between for us overseas visitors without a local mobile/cell phone).The room was a good size and clean, and check-in was efficient and cheerful. I'm glad that I had booked in advance, as 'Sold Out' signs were plastered over the entrance.Given the proximity to the airport, double glazing would have further minimised any exterior noise, but it was not too bad.The self-serve continental breakfast (free) was good, with several choices of cereals, juices, pastries etc. Unlike some chain motels, there was also a good sized area in which to eat.On my departure, I caught the shuttle to the airport, and the driver kindly dropped me very close to the hire car shuttle bus, which saved lugging my bags across busy traffic.Whilst it would have been nicer to be a bit closer to the Strip, the Best Western served me fine for an overnight stay after a long flight from Australia. I'd have no problem staying there again."
29,291,"Nov 22 2007 	Low Cost	This was a low cost hotel, and as such I had low expectations. I was right, you get what you pay for in Las Vegas. Stayed on 2 occaision in a family room - great value in vegas for 5 of us, but the place was a little run down and had the feel of a hostel. It would be a cracking hotel for people looking for a cheap room if they were wanting to go partying on the strip - but as we started a 3 week vacation on the west coast, this was not a great start.It is nicely located and cheap, but pay a bit more for a proper hotel!"
30,291,"Nov 17 2007 	Old 	We chose this particular place because it was close to the airport andthe price was right. ($58) But as soon as we arrived and entered the building it &quot;reeked&quot; of cigarettes. We are not smokers so we &quot;gagged&quot; a little, all the way to our room. The room was old but just okay. The breakfast in the morning was sufficient, bread, cereals, good coffee. Glad to check out and be on our way. The airport transportation was a plus!"
31,291,"Nov 5 2007 	Airport Shuttle Issues and Rude front desk staff	My recent stay at this hotel was a big disappointment. I checked out the website before booking here and one of the reasons I picked this hotel for this one-night stay is because I needed airport transportation...a hard thing to come by in Las Vegas unless you like taxis. In any case, the listing says that the hotel provides airport transportation and some transportation to a couple of named casinos, generous right?...Well, what the listing DOES NOT say, is that the hotel only operates that service until 7pm (which we, of course, landed later and had to wait in those lovely taxi stand lines). And then the next morning, when we needed a ride to the airport, we were told the shuttle only ran on the 1/2 hour and even though the van was there at a quarter-past the hour, we still had to wait another 15 minutes for them to take us to the airport. Maybe that is their &quot;policy&quot; but it wasn't made clear as to what those policies were before booking the room and honestly, as far as customer service is concerned, I think that is a poor decision not to run your shuttle in a &quot;city that never sleeps.&quot; On top of the shuttle disappointment, when we checked in to the room, the lady at the front desk, was rude and just in a &quot;general bad mood.&quot; Again, not the face and attitude one wants to see when already disappointed in a service error and then have to deal with rudeness too. She started out rude to my husband and I, but we are good at making people treat us better by just adding a little kindness. That worked, but when additional customers arrived and asked about room availability or customers who called and asked questions about why the shuttle service wasn't running, she was rude to them....which also was annoying. From my perspective of overhearing several inquiries about the shuttle service ending at 7pm, it was something many of their customers did not know and was disappointed to find out. The room itself was clean and comfortable. The lack of &quot;black-out&quot; shades was missed since we arrived so late and wanted to sleep in the next morning. The breakfast was better than many that hotels offer. Some kudos for that.Best Western hotels, in general, are lovely places to stay. I would have to say even consistently nice. This one is the exception. I would not stay here again."
32,291,"Jul 16 2007 	""Best"" Western- NOT!	We reserved the room a week in advance. When reserving online, an option for a non-smoking room was not given. When we arrived, the room reeked of cigarettes. We asked the staff to switch our room but they claimed they were completely full. We considered demanding a refund, but after considering the facts: Saturday night in Vegas, over 110 degrees, and we had been driving all day and were tired, we decided that we did not wish to look for another hotel. Once settling in the room, we realized that the fitted sheets on the beds were too small and continually came off. The air conditioner was very loud and irritating. Overall, this was a very poor hotel and I would not recommend."
33,291,"Apr 17 2007 	Close to the airport but quiet!	After reading through the reviews of Las Vegas hotels I finally decided on the Best Western-McCarran. I felt this hotel offered the best value for the money although the close proximity to the McCarran airport would be determental to any chance of a good nights sleep. Boy was I surprised. Either they flew a Southwesternly departure route or I was really tired. Only once did I hear a plane departure. The facilities were absolutely imaculate! The room was very nice although there wasn't a refridgerator or microwave in the room. Hotel security was very good. Morning breakfast was the normal continental breakfast items, juices/coffee, bagel and sweet rolls, and cereal. There was wireless internet throughout the building but when you don't have your own PC it doesn't do a bit of good! I wish they had a &quot;business center&quot; for guests. The guest laundry room was very handy and clean. The swimming pool was closed for repairs. I recommend this facility if you want to visit Vegas on a budget."
34,291,"Dec 19 2006 	great value near airport pleasantly surprised	My husband and I stayed at this property for 1 night. For $70 per night, this hotel was fantastic! They offered a hot breakfast every morning, a small but nice pool, clean rooms and a great location. I noticed that they had a shuttle that ran to the strip and back several times per day, as well as an airport shuttle, both complimentary. I would definitely stay here again."
35,291,"Nov 14 2006 	Good Value and close to airport	We stayed at this Best Western as it was close to the airport and quite reasonable. The room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast that was included was basic but good, and the location near the airport can't be beat. Be sure to request a room on the east side to avoid traffic noise. Never heard any aircraft at all!! We would stay here again."
36,291,"Sep 15 2006 	Good hotel bad location	The hotel is good. it's clean, free internet, nice breakfast. all was ok and I might come back. but... the location is bad. If you don't have a car (and you don't want to pay for parking in vegas), going to the strip and back will cost minimum of 10$ each direction. so if you're thinking on going to the strip in the morning, then rest and go back again in the evening you are looking at 50$ with tip taxi expanses."
37,291,"Jun 19 2006	Good airport location	This is an okay motel when you are looking for something close to the airport in Las Vegas. You can call for the free shuttle when you arrive and get a fairly quick pick-up. Note the shuttle only runs until 7 PM. You can also get a free shuttle to MGM Grand on the strip on the half hour and can call for the return trip up until 7 PM. The rooms were clean and the continental breakfast adequate. One drawback is there is no restaurant close by. They do offer a take-out room service. We ended up walking several long blocks down to an intersection by the Hard Rock Cafe where there are several choices, but I wouldn't want to do it on a hot night. I would stay here again if Vegas was just a one night stopover enroute to another destination."
38,291,Jun 3 2006	Basic and reasonable	This is an economical choice for staying near the airport. The rooms were clean and the staff friendly. It is a $5 cab ride to the hotel - just be sure to mention which Best Western you are staying at! There are three in Las Vegas and the cab drivers are known not to listen too closely!
39,291,"May 30 2006	Oh dear!	Stayed a night after flying from UK and before collecting car. Rooms are typical Best Westernm, clean and comfortable enough, breakfast and pool just OK and staff were very helpful. All else is tacky and not to be recommended. Since most Vegas Hotels have some form of airport shuttle you would be better off on the srtip."
40,291,"Apr 17 2006	I'll be back	The McCarran is tops for the budget minded. Our two days left us wishing we had spent the whole week of our stay in and around Vegas at McCarran. It's friendly, It's clean, It's close without being close. The amenities are 1st class. Our granddaughter loved the pool. Our week was spent at several BW's in Vegas and Arizona. This was tops. A real pleasure. I don't say that about many accomodations."
41,291,"Mar 22 2006 	Great retreat from the strip	I travel annually to Las Vegas on business and have found staying in casino hotels to be a real pain, you either have to wait for the valet or park a mile away, then it's a major headache negotiating the casino on the way to your room. The McCarran Inn which is located near the airport but close enough to the south strip to be very convenient is great. Park within 50 feet of the front entrance, walk in and be in your room in less than 90 seconds. Large rooms, they are well maintained and clean. The noise from hallway in the early morning can be a little irritating, but not as bad as I have found at casino hotels where I have been awakened in the middle of the night by a bunch of drunk partiers. Best Western has free calls in the US and now most of their properties offer free wireless internet. This is truly a bargain, even though its not fancy."
42,291,"Jan 31 2006	** Good Value **	We decided to stay just off of the main Strip in Vegas and this was a nice hotel. The rooms were spacious, and very clean. Had everything you needed considering you probably are only there to just sleep! You'll be too busy sight seeing, or gambling! You're 10-15minutes walking distance from the strip or a 5minute bus journey. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. You free-phone them when you arrive at the airport, and they pick you up. They drop you back to the airport - all included. Every hour on the hour til 7pm they drop off and pick up at the MGM Grand hotel casino for free. Or you can just get a 24hour bus pass from the Deuce buses that run up and down the strip for $5 which covers the CAT buses all around the area or for $2.50 24hour pass on a CAT bus which picks up right next to the petrol station next door, the CAT only pass you have to pay 50cents every time you ride a Deuce bus on the Strip, so a 24hour Deuce pass is great value! Breakfast at the hotel is ok - fresh fruit, bagels, toast, cereal, danish's etc... But if you want a huge breakfast just go to the buffet breakfasts they have in every BIG Casino Hotel on the Strip - you don't have to be staying at them to eat at them! So for a very cheap stay - compared to staying on the Strip - it is well worth it - gives you more money to Gamble. Good Luck!"
43,291,Jan 19 2006 	don't smell this place	The price must of been right cuse my company put here for 5 days. first off what they did not say was they will not pick you up at the air port after a spacific time on most days. second the room I was given was a view of the pool that did not in any way look good. 3rd the bed was very hard and that lead me to aroung 3 hr. of sleep every day I was there. 4th the pellows smelled like smoke from a pipe ( I know what you are thinking and yes it was a smoking room but this was the first on where you did not have to smoke to get you nicaten). 5th the van driver when i did get one ride from him to the strip was very nice and helpfull. neddless to say I called the air port in my 3rd day in vegas and was able to change my flight out early. I did tell my boss I would rather get fired then stay in a place like this agin.
44,291,"Nov 1 2005	good value	Good value basic hotel, clean but a bit dated. They run a shuttle across to the Strip and the airport. Wireless internet available and an excellent complimentary breakfast. Good value for off the Strip accomodation."
45,291,"Oct 20 2005	Not bad at all...	We stayed here for part of our Vegas trip in July of this year. We were here for 5 nights, a friend of ours who was travelling with us got us a room for 29.00 / night as she is a Best Western employee. The rooms were always clean, it was quiet, there were coffee pots in the rooms, and the continental breakfast was always nice. Not a large resort on the strip, but we had our own vehicle with us, and so driving to the strip or the Fremont area was not a problem. We didn't spend much time in the rooms at all, and so only used them to sleep and shower. It was more than adequate for our needs, the staff were friendly and we enjoyed our stay immensely."
46,291,"Sep 23 2005	One armed bandit	Rooms ok but high priced for location. Lost a dollar in the Coke machine and the front desk wouldnt refund it ,&quot;stating it was policy not to refund lost money in the coke machine.&quot; Can you believe that, service policy poor for an over $100 a night hotel. Coke machine must be a good money maker."
47,291,"Jun 28 2005	Very convenient	We have used this hotel for two years. It's position is ideal for people staying overnight after a long flight (last year our flight was delayed and we had been awake for twenty-four hours by the time we arrived in Las Vegas). We pick up a rental car the following morning, using the hotel's courtesy bus to take us to the airport and the rental company's bus."
48,291,"Jun 27 2005	OK for airport hotel	We stayed here for 1 night before flying out of Vegas. It was fine as a one night stop only, as it wasn't really close enough to The Strip / amenities to stay any longer.The room was clean and modern and we used the pool, which was a nice extra to the hotel.Would stay here again / recommend for 1 night stays."
49,291,Apr 12 2005	good hotel	stayed at this hotel for one night. It was a clean hotel and the bed was comfortable compared to the high priced strip hotel i stayed at the night prior. It is a great location if you are attending an event at the thomas &amp; mack centre. I would probably stay here again for the cost. My only problem was being woken up bright and early by the garbage truck emptying the bin directly below our window. It is across the street from the post office so im sure the traffic could get a little loud. Would definantly need a car if you are staying here.
50,291,"Mar 31 2005	Dont Swim In The Pool!!!	Got this room for $35 on Priceline for one night.....this was just a room to crash for our late nite flight back home to NJ.....Okay ....this was no Bellagio...LOL....the room was clean....but you could see this was an old resort....the room and halls had a musty odor...like mildew or something....I wouldn't stay here unless I HAD NO OTHER place to go to...The pool was a joke....I was wondering why no one was swimming...until I got closer to it.....it was pretty dirty...with leaves and dead bug carcasses strewn on the bottom of the pool....yuck!!I overheard a front desk clerk tell someone that they were sold out that nite.....but the normal rate for the weekend was $181.......they got to be kidding...for that money, I could stay at any fancy one on the strip...Bottom line...if you MUST be super close to the airport...its okay...Just dont expect anything like you would expect from a hotel like Bellagio or Venetian."
51,291,"Oct 19 2004	good for the right price	We stayed here during a busy weekend (Jimmy Buffett concert). We were able to get a military rate (84.00) but I overheard them quote $120 and up for a night. I certainly wouldn't pay that price. The hotel in itself is pretty good. The rooms were clean and they did provide a shuttle to the airport and the strip. Make sure you make note of the times of the shuttle though. We were on the strip on Sunday and called to get a pick up and were informed that the last shuttle ran at 7 p.m. The pool was also closed for repairs. The only real problem we encountered was the shower. The temperature would fluctuate if you flushed the toilet or I believe if someone else near by was showering too. So be careful, especially if you have youngsters taking showers."
52,291,"Sep 13 2004	Good price/quality	This certainly isn't a luxury hotel/casino/resort, but if you want a clean room for a good price, then this is it. Self-serve continental breakfast consists of the usual drinks, milk, juice, muffins, cereals, french toast, bread, oatmeal. Those items are frequently restocked.The hotel is close to the airport, therefore handy for a first or last night. It can be a bit tricky to find it, because it's in a one-way street. When you ask directions at the car rental company at the airport, it should be no big problem to find it, however. In our room, we could hear the airplanes, but the noise was sufficiently reduced to be able to sleep comfortably."
53,291,"Aug 3 2004	Absolutely fine	We stayed overnight at the Mccarren Inn on the 24th July 2004. We arrived late at night, very tired after a long flight. The reception area although clean was dull and needed a makeover of more seductive colours. However the room was more than adequate, with two queen beds, good sized bathroom, coffee machine etc. Everything in the room was clean and tidy and more than suited our overnight stay. Complementary breakfast was also good, however the eating area, which is part of the reception area also needed brightening up. If you are looking for an overnight hotel near the airport then this one is ok. Don't be put off by the dull reception."
54,291,"Jul 2 2004	Good Inexpensive but you should have a car to stay here	We stayed at the McCarran Inn upon our arrival in Las Vegas (we were on our way to Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and NOT remaining in Vegas for a long visit) On a Saturday night there are no cheap, good rooms in Las Vegas close to the airport (our plane landed at near midnight on Saturday night at the beginning of June 2004). This was the least expensive place we could find -- at $71 a night. I was expecting a flea bag motel -- instead it was very nice and clean, comfortable and had a great free breakfast buffet (juice, coffee, milk, cereal-- including instant hot oatmeal, muffins, danish,toast,fresh fruit and peanut butter packets. The only drawback is (if you are staying to see Vegas for a while) -- you need to have a car because the motel's location is away from the Strip and the Casinos. But everyone should know that if you have a car you can drive to the free lots at any of the big hotels (the Luxor is a good place to park and walk), and tour the Strip as late as you want. This makes the McCarran Inn a great bargain. I hate the long walk in and out of those huge casino hotels -- at this motel you are out and into your car in a minute instead of struggling across the casino floor with your luggage or if you forgot something in your room (it can take a half hour to get to your room and back outside in one of those huge hotels). I know some people love to stay in the lavish casinos (and there are some great package-deal bargain rooms during the week) -- but some people,like us,only needed a nice,clean,safe place to sleep on their way to a glorious week out in the wilds of Utah. In that case -- this MacCarran Inn is a really good choice. I hope this information was helpful for any of you planning a trip to Bryce and Zion with a late flight into Vegas."
55,291,"Jun 11 2004	absolutely horrible place	My family stayed our last night at this place because we had a 6 am flight the next morning and had to take the shuttle, which by the way was so late to leave the hotel that we almost missed our flight back to atlanta! This place was so nasty and moldy, I could nor hardly sleep! Also, the air conditioner wasnt working well either in 106 degree weather. I felt like i was smothering all night long. There were no other rooms to put us in (so they said) i would never stay here again! I would walk to the airport from the strip, before staying in that place again!"
56,291,"Oct 17 2003	Ant Hotel	October 2003. This was not my best Vegas vacation. This was a family vacation 6 people total.I thought that I was getting 2 queen beds and a pull out sofa. I got 2 queen beds and a pull out chair. (Beware) The closet is nearly non-existant.And the ants. We went to sleep and got bit. That day they cleaned out the ants (we think), but they missed the few in the bathroom. We had to live with those the whole stay.Oh, their website says that the pool is heated, it is not. It was too cold for even the kids to go in.I forgot to mention in my earlier review that the continental breakfast from 6:30 - 10:00 ran out of danishes and french toast everyday by 7:30. The breakfast consisted of danishes, french toast (bagels or croissants when the first two ran out), bread for toast, corn flakes, fruit, juices, milk and coffee.The good thing was that there was always plenty of coffee."
57,291,"May 18 2003	I'd do it again	Hey, we were looking for a cheap place to stay on our final night of vacation. This place is not bad. Close to the airport and the Strip. Easy to turn the car back in and get back to the terminal. Not the cleanest or the nicest, but you get a decent continental breakfast before catching your flight. For $39, it fit the bill perfectly for us. I'd do it again."

1,298,Sep 21 2007	If you want to be treated disrespectfully then Budget Suites is fo you!	I temporarily neded a place to stay because I didn't know how long I would be staying in Las Vegas. When I went tot the desk
1,299,Aug 10 2007 	What The Hell?	I moved to Las Vegas and needed a place to stay until my house was ready. Obviously
1,300,Nov 17 2005	Wouldn't stay for free	Left boston November 1st thru 15th I left a week early without a refund. To the person who says he loves it and will go back forget about it. I have no axe to grind with these people here are just a few of the problems. These units are not kept up at all. The pictures look good on the computer but this place is not good. I was brushing my teeth the very first morning when I was confronted by a roach scared the out of me. Bathtub filled with water
2,300,Jun 28 2005	Stinks - literally!	A mushroom cloud of animal urine smell engulfed us as soon as we opened the door. We blasted the room with AC opened all the windows thinking that the smell will go away but it never did. Eventually all our clothes soaked up the smell and we stank ourselves! Calling/visiting the reception was of little use - staff on the night shift are not empowered to help and apparently no other room was available. We had no choice but to flee to the nearby Circus Circus. I believe mine is a rare case but I would never risk it again.	
3,300,Oct 5 2003	Would go no where else	have been to stardust road three times and returning in2004
1,301,Mar 18 2004	Unhappy with budget suites tropicana las vegas	When we reached budget suites of america
2,301,Mar 10 2004	loved the tropacana	My friend and I just got back from five days and four nights at the tropacana. We had a ball. The slots were loose help very friendly The entertainment was fantastic and everyone should go see the free air play that they perform six times a day. We received many comps and we had a problem with the hot water not turning off and called them at one in the morning and it was fixed within ten min. We will be going back there next year and staying at the tropacana.	
3,301,Apr 13 2003	Great Place to Stay If You Arrive a Day or Two Early	We have stayed at this Budget Suites twice. And Would stay again if we got into Las Vegas a day ahead of our arrival date at another hotel. The price is right and check in is as early as you like. The rooms are clean but are inneed of a few renovations. We liked it because it has a kitchenett with stove and fridge. Pool was nice and they also have a coin laundry. Not a bad place to stay if you are driving to Las Vegas as it is off the strip
1,302,Sep 29 2008 	Such a HORRIBLE place!!!	We stayed in room &quot;J 3124&quot; and it was a real mess of a hotel. as one guest pointed out about room 1118J
2,302,Jan 14 2007	Horrible111	What a horror story! We arrived at 11:30 pm in the pouring rain. Guess what? They did not inform us that their office closes at 11:00 on Wednesdays. We went to a neighbouring Budget Suites
3,302,Oct 26 2006 	The Tower of London	The medieval castle would have been preferred over this dungeon
4,302,Feb 6 2005 	Absolute Nightmare	This place is a NIGHTMARE. They don't tell you on the phone about all the additional charges - for your key
5,302,May 6 2004	What a nightmare	What an absolute nightmare of a place.It's amazing how clean and nice this hole looks on the internet and how it looks when you get there. When we checked in
6,302,Mar 25 2004	Dirty room stained carpet low income housing?	Room 1118 J needs to be condemed. Upon walking through the front door that looks like it had been kicked in at one time
7,302,Oct 16 2003	look elsewhere.there must be better	walls are very thin. you hear all neighbors all night.too close to train tracks. bed mattress is cheap and very hard.the couch is disgusting
8,302,Oct 11 2003	2nd vist not so good	I wrote a review about this hotel this past July
1,303,Elegant and Excellent Customer Service	Loved the room. Up on the 42nd floor facing the Bellagio's Fountain (loved the fountains at night...beautiful). Got a call from the desk checking to see if we loved the room. My cousin also got a nice gift for her birthday which was in a few days. TV in the bathroom with a jacuzzi. Very nice.The buffet was lovely and the food was very well prepared and tasty.
2,303,"Great Location Good Stay	We really enjoyed our Thursday - Sunday stay at Caesar's. We booked for the Forum Tower and were &quot;upgraded&quot; to a bigger jacuzzi room in the Palace Tower. Overall, we had a good stay. Our room was spacious, well-appointed, comfortable and clean. It was a bit of a walk to get to everything (except the pool), but that's Vegas. The pool was great and we really enjoyed the jacuzzi tub. Check in and check out were smooth and professional.Caesar's is one of the best locations on the strip and we definitely took advantage of staying here."
3,303,"Can't Go Wrong	Caesars doesn't really need much comments. It lives up to everything. Location is definitely good. Nothing really bad about my stay. They ran out of double rooms in the tower we had an upgraded us to a more expensive room that had two double beds without a hassle. Even if the tables are too expensive, you can walk across the street to Bill's Gambling Hall and O'Sheas to get some of the more cheap spots."
4,303,"Great Location and Pool	My Maids of Honor took me there as a surprise for my bachelorette party and it truly was a blast! We upgraded the room for a small fee (it was off season) and it was the coolest room I have ever stayed in. It was very clean and our view was spectacular. The resort location truly is the best. We were right in the middle of everything which allowed us to walk everywhere. If you like to party make sure to check out Pure. Show proof that you are staying in the hotel and they should let you in without paying a cover (This is what we did). The downfall to the hotel is the food they serve in the food court is just awful. Also, a drink by the pool and room service is extremely expensive. For a normal sized margarita by the pool was $20! So get ready to splurge!"
5,303,"Roman Tower - As dirty as Rome	This was our first stay at the Caesars Palace. Having stayed at other upscale hotels in Vegas like the Mandalay Bay, the Venetian, Paris, and Luxor, I expected to get at least the same type of room if not better at the Caesars. Boy was I wrong? We stayed in the Roman Tower on the 14th Floor and all I can say was that Motel 6s I've stayed at during my younger days were cleaner and more up to date.First of all, the TV was a tiny 20&quot; Tube sitting in a cabinet that had to be at least 20 feet away from our bed due to the weird L shape of our room. There was no real closet in the room, the safe was awkwardly sitting on the floor in one corner looking like someone could just pick up the whole thing and walk away. Furthermore, one of the light bulbs in the recess lights right above our bed was missing and the entire socket appeared to be covered with what looked like mold. The bathroom was extremely old, with cracks on the vanity and mildew looking stains on the walls.... disgusting!The room was EXTREMELY NOISY. Every time one of our neighbors flushed the toilet, ran the sink, or took a shower, there was a sound of water running through the pipes that was so loud in our room, we couldn't hear each other talking. I'm not exaggerating, it was THAT loud.We only found the hair dryer on the last day when checking out. It was hidden a lower drawer below the TV. Why it would be there I have no idea.In any case, if staying at the Caesars, make sure it's not the Roman Tower. I don't know what their other Towers are like but I'm hoping they're better than this dump."
6,303,"Great place to stay - I plan on being back if they comp me again	We stayed at Caesars Nov 22 thru 27th, 2009. Our first time staying at Caesars and we had gotten comped for all five nights (keep in mind this is a slow time for Vegas), because of our play and stay at other Harrah properties. Check in was about 20 mins, we had a comped room in the forum tower, I did the $50.00 tip and got us upgraded to the Augustus tower with a view of the bellogio fountains. We definately recommend this tower, rooms are awesome. We did not eat at Ceasars, we have other favorites around town. We bring our own water/coffee heater with cappicino when we go to vegas with cereal and pick up our water/pop/milk at Walgreens or the ABC store at Planet Hollywood with a collapsible cooler along. We highly recommend you go on line and google &quot;floor plans for vegas casinos&quot;. Knowing your hotel and casino before you get to vegas will save a lot on foot power. Yes we did come home a winner, just remember always play where the people are. The most people were in the forum casino playing the pennies, just keep in mind you can play up to $5.00 a spin on the pennies."
7,303,"Great Stay!!!!	Stayed at Caesars from Nov 23 -27.After reading some of the reviews for the hotel we were a bit leary about the stay. We arrived early and went to diamond check in and to our surprise there was no waiting. Check in took about 10 minutes. Was given a great room in the Forum Tower. Large room with a comfy king bed and the bathroom was very large as well. Staff was great. Third night there housekeeping removed robes and towels from the bathroom and forgot to replenish. This was quickly fixed with one phone call, Plus they gave us a $25 comp to our room for the hassel. Gaming was great at Caesars. First night I hit a $2100 jackpot. Actually left LV with money in our pockets! Food was a bit pricey but worth it. Bradley Ogden is a must. Food was GREAT! Buffet was not as good as the Rio but still good ( lots to choose from). Forum shops have a lot of variety. They do need more benches for those of us who need to stop and take a breather along the way. We enjoyed our stay at Ceasars and will be returning again next year. For those who did not have a good experience. Well this is vegas and everything is a &quot;gamble&quot; out here even the hotels."
8,303,"Great place but I doubt if we would stay again	we have just returned from a week staying at Ceasars. The place is absolutely magnificent but HUGE - we requested the Augustus Tower as we had read that it was the closest tower to check in - THANK GOODNESS WE DID !!! by the time we checked in - mind you it took about an hour and there were only 5 of us in line at the time. The walk to the elevator to our tower was bad enough, but watching the people lugging their suitcases through the casino trying to find their way to their accomodaton was rediculous. You need a GPS system just to find your way through Ceasars. In my opinion its just TOO BIG and not very well set out - things are just too hard to find and there are a million ways you can go to find them. The rooms were fantastic - clean and modern - One thing though as a lot of other people have pointed out DO NOT TOUCH OR MOVE ANYTHING IN THE MINI BAR/FRIDGE - it is all on a sensor system and even if you move something it goes onto your account. Also we were told not to put any of our drinks or anything else we buy in the fridge, but we can hire a mini fridge - they do this for you at a charge of $30.oo per day MY GOD HO REDICULOUS.... we spent a lot of time eating and gambling elsewhere as we found that a lot of the other places had better eating places and the atmosphere was a lot friendlier and relaxed. We will be returning to Vegas within the next 12 months and while it was a magnificent place to the eye - we will be staying elsewhere - as we looked into a few other places offering the same great location/with better customer service and a lot cheaper rates."
9,303,"wheres the ice!!!!!!	arrived at ceasers on wednesday the 25, 09 and stayed at the centurian tower it was not what i expected. I like to have a drink when i get to a new place unpack and unwind well there was no ice bucket i call room service and they said no ice avaiable in the entire tower they bring it up from the basement to your room i called twice i thought they got lost i said ill go down and get it but they were onthere way sure enough there my bucket of ice 1 hour later no refer in the room no coffee pot its just not what i exspected from ceasers never stayed there befor never will again 23 inch pioneer tv give me a break i really like the forum shops though get a ice cream cone 13 dollars a scoop i licked it really slow what a joke its just not the same out there any more no comps no ICE!!!!!"
10,303,"Caesars VERY overrated	Paid $206 (including tax) for a deluxe room at caesars on lasvegas.com for 1 night on 11/26/09. The price was fair in my opinion for what i was SUPPOSED to get which was a room in the AUGUSTUS tower with 2 queen beds. The day before i was supposed to arrive i got an email stating that my flight would arrive 3hrs earlier than first projected, so i called caesars to ask if i coulf possibly check in early, &quot;shouldn't be a problem, happens all the time&quot;, she said. So i arrived approx 1130 am thursday, and as im pulling in to the VALET there is a sign that reads &quot; VALET FULL. please self park&quot;. So as im about to backup and find the &quot;self park&quot; a parking employee informs me that &quot;if your checking in that valet should not be a problem&quot;, that they only put out that sign to &quot;detour locals, and non hotel guests&quot;. So i proceed to the valet, where i promptly let them know im checking in. Once inside i proceed to the hotel guest check-in. Upon arriving to the line im met by a CP employee who is telling everyone that &quot;early check-in doesnt start until 1pm&quot;, so i tell her that ive already contacted the hotel and they know i will be arriving early. She wants none of it! Tells me to go check my bags at bell station and to come back at 1. So i proceed to walk about 50ft away to some sofas and wait. About 15mins later she disappears so i take the opportunity to jump in the line.. What do you know they have some rooms available!! Gee imagine that! The man at the desk informs me &quot;im upgrading your room for free&quot;.. Ok now im starting to forget about everything and warm-up to this place. After informing me that they would charge an additional $200 on my debit card for &quot;incidentals&quot;, he informs me that im staying in the PALACE TOWER room 1038. COOL. So instead of walking 50 feet to the AUGUSTUS tower elevators i walk about 300yds to the PALACE tower elevators which are in no-mans land it seems. Im located on the 10th floor. I open the door, and to my displeasure im greeted by 1 KING bed (i had booked 2 Queens). Now if i wasnt staying with my 55yr old mother, i wouldnt have been to pissed. But being that im not 11yrs old anymore, sleeping with your mother is alittle weird in my book. So i call to the front desk and ask for someone to talk to.. They transfer me to call HOUSEKEEPING. I talked to someone and they inform me that a ROLL-AWAY bed will be an extra $30 dollars! So i agree, and within 30mins a man knocked on the door with the bed. About 730-8pm we arrive back at CP from having a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner at &quot;The Tillerman&quot; steakhouse on flamingo rd, only to be told that since we arent &quot;checking in&quot; that we would have to self park. We explained that we were guests of the hotel and that we had valet'd earlier without problem. After getting serious additude from the valet kid (string bean white kid) we talked to a &quot;manager&quot; that told string bean to park our car. So at CHECK-OUT the next morning i explained my situation to the clerk, and she managed to adjust the $30 roll-away charge OFF my room's bill. Ive had better customer serive DOWNTOWN for 1/3 the price. Will not return. Btw, our room did overlook the 7 pools that no one seemed to be at."
11,303,"Definitely the best holiday I have ever been on and probably the most fun week I have ever had.	Coming from the UK to Las Vegas In a small group.Earlier this year we decided that for my dads 60th we would all go on a trip to Las Vegas. This trip was to spend quality family time and to have a whole lot of fun. We looked up and down the strip, checked websites, read blogs and there were pros and cons to every hotel. Some are newer, some have particular features, but in terms of location, amenities and what the hotels have to offer for entertainment and dining, we selected Caesars Palace. Having spent some time trying to organise the trip from the UK, making transatlantic phone calls and surfing a host of websites trying to book, I was introduced to Harrahs Total Experiences programme where we had a dedicated member of staff to assist in organising our trip. Prior to departure we worked jointly to plan an itinerary, and when we arrived everything was sorted and reserved- we were put in a good room, no cheeky $20 at the desk!As a group of four we all had different plans in what we wanted to do during the day. Timothy played poker tournaments, Orry and Robin took advantage of the golf courses and the perfect sunshine and being centrally located, I could wonder about, do some shopping and admire the other hotels the strip.We could enjoy ourselves safe in the knowledge that tickets were booked for the best seats, reservations were made in the best restaurants and no time was wasted, as we skipped every queue to sit in the best VIP areas of nightclubs and not just in the Harrah's properties.We were treated like royalty, and I am sure people were asking, who are these guys with the best seats in the house? but I was not totally surprised, as we look a bit like a boy band as you can see in the photos!There were so many highlights in the 6 days, but it would be remiss not to mention a couple of special things. The Qua Spa at Caesars is among the best in the world. I was so relaxed, I didnt want to leave. Planned to go once, went 3 times and worth every penny. Wish I discovered it earlier in the trip. The cooking at Bradley Ogden was great. Some restaurants have more Michelin Stars, but this is proper cooking for proper people, with the best service in Vegas. We went to Robuchon at MGM, and although French Cuisine is great, you can get it in London (or indeed France!)  It was a dream come true for my dad to meet Bette Midler and get his photo taken with her. Her show was a medley of songs, jokes, stories and dancing and only possible in Vegas. Three weeks later and the photo with Bette has replaced my mothers picture on his office desk! I have a soft spot for old Las Vegas and the neon flashin and one arm bandits crashin, so taking a wonder down Fremont Street ignited a feeling of nostalgia of a bygone era. Would recommend it to all travellers! On previous visits to Las Vegas, we just couldnt get into Pure and other nightclubs being a group of guys. As we booked with Total Experiences, Harrah's arranged for us to be VIPs, dancing and singing with Shaggy on stage, cool! Having dinner at Paris in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower and with the backdrop of the Bellagio Fountains was a perfect way to spend our last night.So thats it. As Robin said, Definitely the best holiday I have ever been on and probably the most fun week I have ever had.i would recommend the hotel, but moreover recommend booking through the Total Experiences programme if you are a group planning a trip, or a stag or a golf break, as they just sorted access and everything we needed on the trip for us, including nightclubs, golf etc. Having organised stag trips from London to Vegas before, I know what a chore it is.They have a website- google, harrah's total experiences or if you are in the UK send me a message and i'll pass on details to Dani who organised our trip (probably not best to pass on personal details on an open forum!!!)OL"
12,303,"Can't wait to go back!	The best 5 days holiday I've ever had. Service second to none - we English think we know what service is but we have no idea. These guys are the ultimate professionals from the bellhop to the top managers. As with some other reviewers, we were, at first, put into a very inferior room in the forum tower but I called reception and 5 minutes later we were in the palace tower in the room of our dreams! Don't know why they keep trying this trick - can anyone hazard a guess? We enjoyed every single exciting second of our visit and can't wait to go back."
13,303,"Nov 21 2009 	First and Last time staying at Caesars	My husband and I go to Vegas every fall. We had never stayed at Caesars, so we figured we would give it a try. We were in the Palace Tower. The room was clean and very nice, but the only view we had was of another building. We didn't have a room service menu in the room, so I called down and they said they would send one right up. Well, we never did get our menu! The ice machine on our floor and also on 2 other floors would not work and we called the front desk twice about this before it was fixed. The coke machine also didn't work on 3 different floors that we tried and they took our money. The buffett is way overpriced for what they offer. The breakfast buffett was good, but not worth the price. Expect to put on your walking shoes because it takes forever to get anywhere in the hotel, especially from your room to the casino. This was also one of the smokier casinos that I have been in. We smelled like walking ashtrays the whole time we were there and we do not smoke. The only good thing I have to say about Caesars is that we did win some money there! But we will not be back!"
14,303,"Nov 20 2009 	Choose your room carefully!	I traveled to Vegas with my mother, who is has Diamond status with the Harrah's hotels.At Caesar's Palace, this gives you access to your own registration desk &amp; other niceties, but we learned that it doesn't guarantee a decent room.They put us in the Colossus Tower, and the room was a real shock! Our two &quot;queen&quot; beds were really doubles, and the room was so small that there was ~6&quot; of space between the ratty couch by the window and the closest bed.But the beds themselves were just perplexing! One was okay, on par with what you'd expect to find in a decent Sheraton or Marriott - lots of padding between the mattress &amp; sheet, nice bedding, 3-4 pillows. The other bed, though, looked like a Motel 6 refugee: a thin sheet over a poor-quality mattress, and two skimpy pillows.So I tried to call the front desk, but the line just rang and rang. Tried the hotel operator, who stayed on the line until she could connect me to someone at one of the front desks. We were immediately moved to a room in the Augustus Tower, which was more in line with what we were expecting.The bellhop sent to transfer our luggage said he didn't know why they still rented out rooms in the Colossus &amp; Roman Towers (the oldest parts of the hotel). Once we saw our new room, I totally agree with him. It was like moving from a Comfort Inn to an upscale boutique hotel! Our new room was significantly larger, and included a seating area, a dining table with 4 chairs, two Actual Queen Beds with plenty of fluff &amp; pillows, mini-bar, flat-panel tv, and a luxurious bathroom: dual sinks, separate toilet room, jacuzzi tub, and glass-enclosed shower.Even the elevator lobbies and the hallway carpeting were a BIG step up in quality and appearance. If you visit the hotel's website, they don't even mention the Colossus or Roman Towers. The 360-view of a room in the Palace Tower is very similar to what we had in the nearby Augustus Tower. It really was as if we'd checked into 2 completely different hotels!Also, the spa is located in the Augustus Tower, and is well worth a trip. We both signed up for massages that were just wonderful, and we gave ourselves plenty of time to enjoy the &quot;Roman Baths,&quot; Saunas, etc., before &amp; after. Note: if you need a robe larger than ~2X, consider bringing your own. While we were checking in, another guest discovered that they didn't have enough larger-size robes to meet demand. It was a bit awkward for everyone!Caution: the price they charged us was a bit higher (~$30 each) than what we were quoted on the phone for our massages. When we said something, the clerk just shrugged his shoulders &amp; kept processing our payment. We didn't push, but I urge you to watch for that, in case it's a common practice.Long story short: location, location, location. Avoid the Colossus &amp; Roman Towers like the plague unless/until they have been completely overhauled &amp; renovated! Maybe they should just raze the buildings &amp; start over."
15,303,"Nov 19 2009 	Part of the Las Vegas experience	A stay at Caesar's Palace should be an essential part of a visit to Las Vegas but, be warned, compared to most of the other casinos, it is very expensive. We got a very good deal which included tickets to Bette Midler plus a nights stay for a reasonable price but we tried to book an extra night and found a fairly standard room to be $200 with no chance of a discount. In the end we booked across the road (literally) at Hurrahs and got a superior room for a quarter of the price!That said, the one night we had was a great little bit of luxury which added to the whole experience of being in Las Vegas. It was good to see the (wonderful) show and then just go up in the lift to bed. The room had all we could ask for and more with a great view and so was worth paying a bit over the odds just for one night. I think Caesar's Palace play too much on their name to keep prices artificially high, so be aware you can get much better deals in equally good accomodation elsewhere."
16,303,"Nov 18 2009 	One of the best hotels I've stayed in	One of the nicest hotels on the Las Vegas strip, within walking distance to all the main attractions like the Pirate Show at Treasure Island, The Bellagio Fountains, Paris and the Miracle Mile shops.Caesars Palace is huge, you need a day in your itinerary just to walk around the hotel and the in hotel &quot;forum shops&quot;.We arrived and were presented with an option to upgrade our room for an extra $140 USD for our 3 night stay, which we did. The upgrade took us into one of the towers overlooking the Bellagio fountains. We had a double shower, jacuzzi, huge TV, couch and table.I recommend you talk to the person who checks you in and see what upgrades are available at the time of check in.Overall this hotel is great, the food in the hotel is devine and the shopping is fantastic. You will lose yourself in a world of luxury.. without paying too much money for it! You will feel like a celebrity!"
17,303,"Nov 17 2009 	Pay for the upgraded rooms if you stay - classic rooms not worth it	I thought I would splurge for a nicer hotel for my 25th birthday, instead of TI, MGM, definitely am not a fan of luxor. I thought Caesars would be nice, classy, and the rooms would be more impressive than what we have usually gotten year after year. Not the case. We were in a classic room not in a newer upgraded tower. If you stay here make sure to get a new tower room or suite, otherwise the rooms at TI and MGM are 10 times better. The bathroom was horrible, so small, little closet space, beds and linens horrible quality. Luckily the shopping and entertainment are all there so it does have a good location. Overall it was an ok stay, but I will not stay there again."
18,303,"Nov 16 2009 	First time at Ceasars - and last	Went to Ceasars for a convention and booked 2 extra days to enjoy Vegas. When we checked in we were told that we were booked into their smallest room and we &quot;may not find it adequate&quot;. We were offered an upgrade to a nicer room for an additional $40 per night which we declined. I asked about an in-room coffee maker and was told &quot;No, but we have 24 hour room service available&quot; (a 3-cup carafe of coffee was $12.00). I asked about the fitness facility and was told &quot;Yes, we have a world-class fitness facility available to guests for $25 each per day or a 3 day pass is available for $50 each&quot;. I asked about the pool and was told that the pool complex was closed (mid-November but 80 degrees and sunny) but there was a pool available to hotel guests for $10 each M-F or $20 each SS. I asked about wi-fi access and was told it too was available for $10 additional per day. Our room was in the Roman tower. It was dated with peeling wallpaper, and there were peanut shells on the floor which I was able to find with my bare feet. The room had a strange layout with no door on the bathroom. It had a nice view of the roof of the adjoining building. All this for the reduced rate of $250 per night (regularly $400). Needless to say, I let my employer pay for the two days there to attend the conference and then switched my remaining two days to a neighboring hotel on the strip for half the price and enjoyed a nice room with all the amenites that cost extra at Cesars for free, including a great pool. Cesars enjoys a great reputation as one of the premier places to stay on the Las Vegas Strip. From my experience, this reputation is not well deserved and a stay at another property is recommended. Thanks for reading and enjoy your stay in Las Vegas!"
19,303,"Nov 16 2009 	Everything in one Place	A traditional hotel keeping with pride its traditional quality and elegance. Everything is here, good restaurants, famous stores, good shows, excellent bars"
20,303,"Nov 15 2009 	Not worth of the price tag and it lacks the class they aspire to	We stayed 8 floor up in the Palace Tower. The room retailed for $500 (we were on a company discount). Adequate room for a $200 per night hotel but no were near the $500 price tag. The worst part about this hotel was the 30-45 minute waits when checking in. People got in from their flight and had a hard time making it to conference events on time. it was like this every day we visited during the week. Not enough staff. One person in line said they had overbooked and started sending patrons down the strip to stay at the Rio and other hotels. Talk about inconvenient - and this they found out after standing in that line. Also, they closed the main swimming pool for some inexplicable reason (claimed it was for a special event that never happened). The service was basically rude and nonresponsive. They acted like you should feel privileged just to be in their hotel. Major thumbs down and not worth the money. Everything cost extra - use of gym, business center, etc. super high prices at the spa."
21,303,"Nov 15 2009 	waiting in line	We watched the check-in line for awhile, but since it didn't seem to get any shorter, we got in line. It took 40 minutes! Surely a big hotel like this can do better than this!The hotel itself is situated in a great location. Restaurants are good. Shops &amp; the in-hotel &quot;mall&quot; are beautiful. Its reasonably priced (for Las Vegas)."
22,303,"Nov 14 2009 	don't know why other whine	Stayed at Caesars in September and the service was good and rooms were clean. This is Vegas if you are spending too much time in your room then you are in the wrong city. I almost laugh when I here complaints about the Spa Charge (they are all $25-$45 not just Caesars), Coffee maker (don't be so cheap go downstairs and grab one), Hotel is too big (as in having too much to offer???), restaurants are expensive (you get what you pay for in Vegas, $4.99 steak and eggs accross the street will come back to haunt you).I stayed in the Fourm Tower and other than the long walk from checkin it is a great location. Its close to the Fourm Shops, Food Court, self parking and Shadow Bar.My only knock to Caesars would be that since the merger of Harrahs and Caesars. Harrahs friendly service is the best on the strip and Caesars used to be the Bellagio of the strip and seem to struggle with the branding of extremely good service as they used to be pretencious. Hope the Harrahs friendliness wins this war.Happy to stay here again and actually heading there in a week."
23,303,Nov 13 2009 	fantastic vegas	Arrived on halloween at about 4.30pm.we had booked a triple and a double room in the roman tower(got a great price) at checkin were greeted by a man called jonathon and nothing was to much troble for this guy. After asking for an upgrade he moved us to 2 mini suites in the palace tower overlooking the pools(all for a very small tip)we had a fantastic week would have no hesitation in returning.
24,303,"Nov 12 2009 	Pretty Nice	I stayed at Caesars as sad as this may sound because of the Hangover. Had I had my time again I probably would have chosen to stay somewhere else as I feel I could have got a lot more for my money elsewhere. Sure, the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are elegant and classy etc but I think for the price I paid at Caesars I could have got a lot more elsewhere. You can get great deals in Vegas on Hotels however when I was booking it seemed Caesars were the only ones not doing &quot;great&quot; deals. Caesars is central to everything which is also a positive. There were no negatives really to staying at Caesars as we had brilliant views from our room etc however when booking tours DO NOT go through your Hotel - go through the vendors on the strip - they are so much cheaper and will actually give you EXACTLY what you want. The Lady at Caesars when booking our Grand Canyon tour booked us in for a plane tour rather than a helicopter tour even though when specially said over and over we wanted the helicopter tour. I was furious when we got there and was told we had been booked for a light plane trip around the canyon. They said we couldnt do the helicopter tour as it was all booked out for that day but they could get us on the next day - we were going home the next day so it really didn't help! If I came back to Vegas I would stay at the Venice themed Hotel or perhaps MGM that being said, Caesars is a wonderful place to stay just a tad pricey and with one incompetent staff member. Beatles LOVE is also awesome - GO SEE IT!"
25,303,"Nov 12 2009 	Not really fit for an emperor	We spent 2 nights at Caesar's palace. Went to see the Bette Midler show there. We're not really gamblers, so the casino wasn't an attraction at all. Check in was slow, and once we got to the head of the line, the agent informed us that they only had a &quot;smoking optional&quot; room or a downgraded non-smoking room. We objected of course, and the agent agreed that &quot;smoking optional&quot; really meant a smoking room. We were ever so politely informed that the reservation of a non-smoking room wasn't a guarantee. In the end we went with the smoking room and it wasn't all that bad in terms of the odor. But the shower had mold/mildew where the walls met the floor. The shower door also leaked which was probably the cause of the water damaged trim near the toilet. On the plus side, we ate at 3 of the in-hotel restaurants and all the food we had was excellent."
26,303,"Nov 12 2009 	Careful which tower you will be staying......	First time in Vegas for a convention, held at Caesar Palace.The rooms (standard and suite) in the Roman Tower were kind of tired and worn out. The standard room lacked of a minibar &amp; coffee making, but was pretty large. The safe was not working.We were told that the Roman Tower was one of the old areas of the hotel, and other towers have better amenities (and carpet, furniture, etc.).What made my stay not enjoyable was the smoking allowed everywhere, with the only exception of the Forum Shops. The location is exceptional, and you can easily walk to the Venetian, Treasure Island, Mirage, Paris, etc."
27,303,"Nov 11 2009 	First time at Caesars	We got there a little early and was not able to check in yet, so stored bags with them and went off to have some fun. Around 1:00 went back to see if we could check in and was able to. We were comped a room in the Augustus tower. Very nice room, large and clean. Right away, we tried to store my purse in the safe and it was not working, so we called and someone came up to fix it. The tech said it was working and left. Again, when we tried to lock up my purse it was doing the same thing, so I just decided I would keep my purse with me. The beds were a little uncomfortable (felt like either really cheap mattresses or mattresses that needed to be replaced) The bed pillows were worn out too. The overhead light in the bathroom did not work and the first night, the jacuzzi tub would not work (but it did the second night-so it may have been something I was doing wrong to try to get it on). One evening we tried to rent a movie and had trouble getting that to start, so called the desk twice and they said they would reset something and they did and the movie did start after that. These are my only complaints about the room. Other than that, we were comfortable in the room, it was quiet, never heard any noise. Ordered room service for breakfast both mornings, took 45 minutes to an hour to arrive, but they told us that when he placed the order. It was a little on the high side, but was worth the convenience. Food was good and plentiful. Ate in the Augustus Cafe for dinner one evening, food was good. We also ate at the food court for lunch one afternoon. It was good there also. Everyone on this site has been complaining about the prices of food, but my opinion is when you stay at a higher end hotel, you really need to expect the food will cost a little more. By the time we left, we had enough comp points to cover the extra costs we incurred. Although I enjoyed the hotel, I do not know if I would stay there again. I was really disappointed with the casino, so many older machines that are literally worn out. We like to play bar poker and was not comfortable at any of the bars. The casino has a lot of wasted space, could fit in many more machines, maybe some new ones. We played bar poker at the Venetian as well as Bellagio, had much more fun there, the bars were quieter and not as brightly lit up. We like to choose a hotel that we can come back to in the evening and spend a few hours gambling there and then only have to walk a short way to our room. Although I had walked through that casino before and probably played a little along the way, I guess I never really paid too much attention to the condition and state of their machines. For that reason, I will probably stay somewhere that we can enjoy the casino more."
28,303,"Nov 10 2009 	It is Vegas but when it comes to customer service don't take your chances.	I recently stayed at Caesars Palace and was quite disappointed in my choice. I had believed that this hotel could be mentioned with the better names in the area, but did not find it to meet my expectations.I had decided to give the hotel a shot when I saw a promotion that was being run over Halloween weekend on Twitter. It sounded like it would be a fun time and what put me over the top was when I saw that the first people to sign up for the promotion would have their room upgraded.I was worried about my upgrade so I sent a tweet to make sure this upgrade was still available (was I in that first X number of people to sign up). They said yes. I still didn't trust it, so to confirm I contacted the hotel through their website as well.When I went to check-in the clerk saw there was a note that I had asked about this upgrade...however, they told me this room was no longer available. I was disappointed and hoping they would care enough to make this up to me in some way. They didn't.I was thinking about staying an additional night beyond what I had reserved, so I asked them if they could do anything for me in this area (the list price for the room for this extra night which was a Sunday was $250- in comparison I knew I could get a room at the Bellagio for that night at $118, so I figured there might be some room to work). No luck.I headed up to my room. It looked ok- nothing special- not terrible, but not worth the price I paid. I checked out the bed- not that comfortable. Later I went to take a shower- handle is broken so it doesn't stay at the hot water side of things. Ok, so I'm stuck with a bad room- maybe it could at least be clean? Housekeeping comes by- my friend is in the bathroom, can you come back in 10 minutes? Ok. We leave. Back in 6 hours...still dirty.So we've stayed two nights, want a third, but there's no deal so we're off to the Bellagio. Time to check out. The clerk asks how the stay was, but obviously doesn't care. I started to say 'actually it wasn't very good...'- but he wasn't really interested. I continued to explain what had happened with the room at check-in...yeah, whatever, you have a $3 balance- shall I put that on your credit card?So that last part kinda sums it up for me. Will everything go right on every stay? No. But what's the attitude when it doesn't? We couldn't wait to get out of there and so we left the hotel at 8am on Sunday and went to the Bellagio. We knew it was very early but asked if we could check in. The clerk said 'I don't think we can do that for someone who is only staying one night'...before laughing and finding us a room. We may have been lucky that there was something available, but from the friendly service I knew they would do their best to take care of us. It was like the opposite of being in Caesars."
29,303,"Nov 10 2009 	Excellent stay	We arrived early afternoon and found a check in line that stretched across the lobby and to the far hall. As I entered the line a man came by and told us that another check in was down the hall with no line. I immediately went there and found it was the executive check-in. I tried anyway and the desk clerk was very gracious. I tried to ask for an upgrade but she said they were full. I asked if being a total rewards member helped. I had written the tower recommendations from trip advisor on the same sheet. She said she thought she could help with something. I did tip as trip advisor said and landed a Palace tower room up from a classic. The Spa tub is the best thing for all the walking in the resort and on the strip. The room was nice with a flat screen TV with many channels and a huge two sink marble bathroom with separate spa tub and shower. Be sure and try Serendipity 3 just in front of Caesars from 3-5 when they have great happy hour prices. While we didn't use the pool, it was huge, but twice the main part of it was reserved for private parties. The food court is nice, once you find it with a good selection and has some of the best food prices."
30,303,"Nov 10 2009 	An Amazing hotel	I have to say it was the best hotel I ever stayed in. It was amazing. The staff were great for such a big hotel they looked after us very well. As we were on honeymoon we were upgraded to a large suite , The rooms were huge and spotless. Entertainment was good. The amenities were excellant and the shops and boutiques were fantastic.Location was perfect as it is in the middle of everythingSo anyone who is going to Vegas should stay here"
31,303,"Nov 9 2009 	Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In	Caesars Palace is the stuff of legends. Everything is right about this hotel, the location, the pools, the rooms, the views, the service, the restaurants etc.We took our two small children (7&amp;6) and stayed in a huge room in Augustus Tower. Plenty of room for all 4 of us and very accessible.Places to eat with families are Planet Hollywood and The Cheesecake Factory (in the Forum), Cheeseburger (in Planet Hollywood), NASCAR Cafe (near the Sahara), Carnival World (at the Rio), Rainforest Cafe (at MGM) and Beijing No 9 for a nice change (Caesars).Great things to do with the kids are Lake Mead Paddle Boats, Circus Circus Adventuredome, King Putt Golf (two of those), Red Rock Canyon, Eiffel Tower, M&amp;M World, Gameworks, Build-a-Bear Factory (Planet Hollywood but take your credit card!).OK things are all the hotel freebies i.e Volcanoes, Fountains, Lion Habitat.Fantastic family holiday - recommend to anyone."
32,303,"Nov 8 2009 	The hotel room was dirty and unkept	My husband and I stayed one night in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace. When we went to check in there were 1600 people checking in that day so we stood in a queque for 40 minutes waiting to check in. The person checking us in was apologetic, but the check in was rushed and devoid of any niceties. We wandered about until we found the elevator to our room. The room was not in a hallway, but around and about as though going to a hidden closet. The view from the room looked at other walls and airconditioning units. The lighting was inadequate. The furniture was well worn and the carpet was filthy. The bed had one thin sheet over a bare mattress which made me afraid of my skin touching the mattress by accident. There were no amenities, like water or a coffee maker. The only redeeming feature was the bathroom which was quite nice. I definitely will not go back and would not recommend this to anyone even for free."
33,303,"Nov 6 2009 	Had a fantastic stay at caesars!	My Husband and I really enjoyed our stay Oct. 18 -23. We checked in at 12:30 p.m. and the check- in lines weren't very long. We were able to use the Platinum line and we were up in our room by 12:45 p.m. (However, an hour later the check-in line was very long). We upgraded to the Augustus Tower for $50 a day and were so surprised at how spacious the room was. The bathroom was huge. I used the ironing board one day and set it up in the bathroom and still had room for 8 people. We had 2 queen beds, a sitting area with a loveseat, chair, coffee table &amp; end table, a dining table with nice comfortable chairs. All the employees of Caesars that we came in contact with (the front desk, housekeeping, cocktail waitresses, waiters, Bellman, etc. were very nice. They also have a good selection of restaurants and great location!We will definitely be staying at Caesars on our next Vegas trip."
34,303,"Nov 5 2009 	pleasant stay	After staying in vegas for two days last year we decided to come back for longer this year. Arrived at caesar's late afternoon and checked in within a few minutes. Did the $20 tip at reception, asked if any complimentary up grades were available and got a Palace Tower room over looking the pool area. Large room, huge bathroom and all spotless. We didn't eat here as we had heard it was expensive for what you got but did have a lovely english breakfast at Planet Hollywood in the forum shops with endless coffee and tea for two for less than $30, it set you up for the day. Ate at the grand cafe lux at the pallazo...massive portions, lots of choice and very reasonable. The pool area looked great but unfortunately the weather was against us. This is a great hotel conveniently place on the strip I would recomend it to any one."
35,303,Nov 4 2009 	Treated better than expected	First time in Vegas. Booked a midweek package to see Bette Midler which included room and theatre tickets. Without asking Joanie at the front desk said she would take care of us and that she did...we were upgraded to a Forum room and our show tickets were upgraded from rear orchestra to front orchestra. I scored some real points with my wife. Caesars Palace is one of the only hotels I have stayed in where the front desk person calls to make sure the room is ok. Pools looked great but no time to use them. They treat you like they appreciate your business and want you back again. And we will be.
36,303,"Nov 4 2009 	Loved this hotel	We have been to Las Vegas quite a few times, and always try a different hotel. This was our 1st time at Caesars' and we were delighted with it. Our (Augustus Tower) room was lovely. Room serivice was excellent and the 2 restaurants we used were great too, the best being Nero's. My only gripe was the 40 minute wait to check in. They REALLY need to do something about that. But next time we're in Las Vegas, we will return to Caesars'."
37,303,Nov 3 2009 	Not So Nice	We stayed at the Ceasars Palace in October for 1 evening and I was very very dispointed. We have a crappy room. It was old and cheesy. The walls are paper thin as all night long we could hear the couple next to us fighting about her cheating husband. Would not recommend this place. It has gone down hill. Stayed there a few years ago and it was very nice. For the money stay somehere else. The hotel staff were also very rude.
38,303,"Nov 2 2009 	Great conference trip	Have decided to write reviews for all the places I've stayed in Vegas, but be warned that my stay here was over a year ago, so things may have changed.I was apprehensive about coming here because I've heard things about how campy and outdated they are. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there's an awful fountain of naked muses in the lobby right when you enter, and there are similarly bad imitations of Classical sculpture everywhere in the hotel, but it's Vegas, so that's to be expected! I was there for a conference and my employer had already pre booked everything. The check in staff were very pleasant and offered a tempting upgrade to a better room for a mere $30 a day. I waffled, then agreed to the offer. When I got to my room, I was stunned--what a great bargain! It wasn't the largest room in the world, but it was around 500 sq. ft, VERY ample space. The decor did not make my eyes hurt. The bathroom was huge and had a TV as well as a jacuzzi tub. And it only came for $30 more! I slept very well--it was quiet and the air smelled clear (rare in Vegas).The conference center was also a pleasant surprise. Very well appointed and large. It was hard to get to from my rooms though. And it was so big I got lost. The casino was average--seemed a bit empty, but the economy had just tanked when I was there (October 2008). The one restaurant we went to, Rao's was good but pricey. I think they were trying to capitalize on their reputation as one of the hardest restaurants to book in New York. I'm still very much an MGM Grand fan when it comes to restaurants, though. Maybe I am limited, but it just seems easier and more dependable, since they've managed to amass just about every noteworthy chef on the face of the earth over there.My colleagues was a bit annoyed with the catering staff at this hotel for our business luncheon, and I must say that they were pretty rude to her regarding her gluten allergy. But that aside, I had a very nice experience here, certainly better than the Venetian, which is supposedly a better hotel."
39,303,"Nov 2 2009 	Learn the ropes here in VegasTAKE CARE OF THE EMPLOYEES	As a frequent visiter to Las Vegas,I noticed certain behaviour in some guests,Well lets start,the hotel was great! We also got a great rate for being a repeat customer! We have gotten to know a few of the customers by name.What we noticed noticed was some customers were down right rude! If someone is helping you ,be nice.if someone is helping you to have a great visit,make sure you tip them.We have learned that if you do the employee goes above and beyond,to make sure they take care of you.I have learned most employes depend on that.Ive also heard the ludacriss remark they dont back home..well guess your not back home.This is a list my husband and I agreed on tipping which is very reasonable.Bell desk-1-2 dollors per bagroom upgrade -20.00Concierge-Dinner rez 5.00**Dinner &amp; show rez 10.00---Boarding passs 3.00**cocktail girls 1-2 a drink**Clubs and table passes come on people their saving you 30.00 a person.Tip them out! And above all be polite when asking for their help.Hope this helps"
40,303,Nov 1 2009 	Beautiful hotel	I stayed 6 nights and the room was very nice. King bed was very confortable. Amenities were fulled everyday. The Forum shops is a must to see.
41,303,"Nov 1 2009 	Amazing Hotel Amazing Holiday !	Just returned from a 4 night party with friends and have to say Caesars is FANTASTIC! Check-in smooth and speedy, upgraded to palace suite (2734) WOW! Housekeeping perfect, turn down and chocolates. Great location at the centre of the strip and most venues a short walk or $6 cab ride. Pool is amazing, yeh the drinks can be pricey but you dont have to buy them there. Great choice of bars and food but have to say the best meal of the trip was at FiAMMA Trattoria inside MGM. Food was Oooooh and the Sommelier complimented our food perfectly. All in all would stay here again without a doubt, LOVE IT !!"
42,303,"Oct 31 2009 	One of the best hotels	The hotel is located in a very good location on the strip. The room was very clean and elegant. We felt at home. Comparing to other hotels, I can say Caesars is the one we liked most. The only negative is the dining prices (as in the other big hotels). There're many restaurants in the hotel but all of them are expensive. We had to go out all the time for food."
43,303,"Oct 30 2009 	Caesars Palace Is GREAT!!!!	I stayed at Caesars Palace Oct 15-18 for my 26th birthday and I was very impressed. After reading reviews I came expecting a very long wait at check. Yes the line was long but it went by really fast. I was upgraded to a room in the Augustus Tower 41st floor room 4190 (one of the newer towers). The room was amazing. Very nice size to accommodate myself and three friends. Large bathroom with a walk in shower, double sinks, large tub, separate toilet and a flat screen TV on the wall. There was a flat screen TV in the room, couch, table and chairs. The fridge and mini were stocked (beware of this because when you move items on top of the bar and inside the fridge your room is billed. We were billed 75.00 for these items but it wasn't a big deal because upon check out the clerk removed the charges.) The Augustus Tower was the closest tower to the exit so if you can get this tower you won't regret it. The Caesars Palace is HUGE. The pool area is amazing; the central strip location is great too. Puts you in walking distance all the other major casinos. I can't wait to go back to Vegas I loved it so much."
44,303,"Oct 30 2009 	Fabulous stay at Caesar's Palace on labor day weekend !!!!!	My spouse and I recently took a trip to Las Vegas. We stayed at Caesars Palace Hotel. We enjoyed every bit of our stay. We loved everything about the hotel. We go to Las Vegas every year and stay at a different hotel . I look on the travel advisor to find out reviews about hotels when I want to stay at them.. I read a review someone had written on Trip Advisor he said ask about the FREE UPGRADE when checking in. Well, we did. We had gotten a great hotel rate on Expedia with a free day. When we arrived we checked in with no wait time. The Front Desk lady tht checked us in was very nice. I told her about the Free Up grade and she said ok. We stayed in the Agustus Towers and it was huge and very nice and so pretty . The bathroom the Jacuzzi the enclosed toilet that no one see you in ther, e it was just great. I would definitely stay there again. and the gambling we won every night. I did not expect to win anything but the slots is whatI played and it was very loose. I played at other casinos too but I always ended up making Caesars my last stop. I would definitely say this is a place to st ay if you find a great deal like we did. We stayed for 5 days. AWESOME HOTEL&gt; STAY INTHE AGUSTUS TOWERS."
45,303,"Oct 29 2009 	Beautiful hotel too big for me!	This hotel is in a convenient spot on the strip which is nice. The grounds are beautiful. We arrived to our room not being ready so we had to wait for a few hours, unless we wanted to pay for an upgrade. finally, when we got to our room, it was a very basic and older hotel room, we were not impressed, this is a 5 star hotel! after much complaining to management they moved our party of 2 rooms to another tower with nicer room for free. These rooms were beautiful, had comfy beds, flat screen tvs and a big bathroom. I guess this was the type of room they wanted us to upgrade to. The housekeeping staff were great. The one thing about this hotel is it is huge. It took 15 minutes to get to our hotel room from the front desk! The casino is massive. The forum mall is great to have so close by, and go to the cheesecake factory!Although this is a beautiful hotel, i wasn't impressed with the front desk service, and honestly this hotel is so big, it takes forever to get anywhere, not sure if i would stay here again."
46,303,"Oct 29 2009 	Will pass next time around	Location is great, it's in the middle of the strip. So you don't have to travel (car or walk) far to either end. Spa was nice. But room was ok at best in the Roman Tower. I'd rate it a 2 star. It's really worn down. Some mildew in the shower. Service is terrible. The line to check in and out was horrible, at least 45 minutes. Told the check in receptionist that they need to get more people working the check in line and she just said &quot;it could be worst.&quot; Yes, she did just make it worst."
47,303,"Oct 27 2009 	Great location shopping and food.	Centrally located to all the action on the Strip, We have already stayed at this property four times this year. On each of my stays, the daily visits to the fitness room and Qua spa- relaxing in its Roman pool - are one of the highlights for staying at the Caesars. The down side is, with each visit, there is a notable decline in promptness of service provided at the poolside, the casino, and also for room service. But, that seems to be the case with every other hotel casino in Las vegas right now due to the recession.The Forum shop is great with a variety of stores for every taste and desire, while the restaurants like Guy Savoy, the Palm, and Joes' Steak and Stone Crab, are just simply delicious and always consistent. Caesars has everything one needs on a vacation. Once I checked into Caesars, I rarely leave the property to go anywhere else in Las Vegas Why would I?"
48,303,"Oct 26 2009 	Great place to stay	Our trip was really enjoyable. The hotel is situated greatly - right in the middle of attraction area. The hotel staff is smiley, polite and very helpful. Rooms are clean, comfortable and nicely decorated. The hotel has a huge territory with restaurants, shops, nice small gardens and fountains. We would stay here again."
49,303,"Oct 26 2009	Caesars Palace Smells Like an Ashtray	Recently stayed there for one evening. The room was fine, the service was fine, the restaurants were all good, but the whole place stinks of cigarette smoke. You couldn't get away from smoke; I felt like a smoked ham after only one day. The other thing is watching people who obviously couldn't afford to lose money, losing money. There may be high rollers in LV but I didn't see any. More like the people you would see at Walmart (nothingwrong with Walmart) rather than at a casino in Monte Carlo."
50,303,"Oct 25 2009 	Caesars Palace New Augustus Tower is Excellent	We stayed at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas Oct. 10-14, 2009. Ive stayed at the other Harrahs properties in Las Vegas, Rio, Ballys, Flamingo, Paris many, many times and Caesars offers by far, the best in service, cleanliness, dining and entertainment options.Asked for upper floor, view room at check-in and got it. Probably didnt hurt to tip reservation clerk a $20 at introduction. Couldnt have been happier with the room. The new Augustus Tower, 37th floor, I think, room # 3783. Excellent view, day or night. Incredibly cool bathroom with large glass shower, jetted soaker tub, double sinks, tv, separate water closet and upscale amenities. The king-bed was very comfortable; the a/c unit responded to controls and was quiet. There is a couch, chairs with smaller round table, another flat screen tv, vanity, just an excellent room for the price. They delivered a small refrigerator to my room at no charge  I like very cold bottled water. The pool area wasnt very active, as it was October, but there are a number of pools to choose from, some heated, and it was surprisingly quiet, even at the pool nearest Flamingo Road.Dining options are too numerous to list, but highly suggest having the softball-sized meatballs at Raos, eating at Bobby Flays Mesa Grill  call for reservations for both, well ahead, as they were packed on a Monday, Tuesday night. The location of Caesars Palace is perfect. Right next door to the Forum Shops, walking distance to the other major casinos, Bellagio fountain, etc. I recommend the affinity card, called Total Rewards, to collect credit if you gamble. We often have dinner for free, on the last night of our Vegas stays, at the steakhouse in the Paris, using gambling credits. The food and service there are flat fabulous. I highly recommend staying at Caesars.And got to mention - loved the Cher show. She really knows how to make an entrance."
51,303,"Oct 24 2009 	had a great stay with a few glitches	just returned from a 4 night stay at Caesar's. Husband and I made our first trip to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. we arrived a couple of hours before check-in and were given a room right away. just be prepared for the hike to the towers. we were there 2 days before i discovered the forum casino. actually did well on the slots. had a wonderful dinner our last night at Nero's steakhouse. very pricey but worth every penny. our waiters Michael and Enrique were great. had no bad experiences with the staff. food is pricey everywhere. and remember to eat early (before 10 p.m.) because all of the decent places shut down early on weeknights. went to fremont st one night they have an awesome light show. took in two shows; Terry Fator at the mirage was fabulous. O at the bellagio, don't waste the money or time. we were very disappointed. had other family and friends with us and all felt the same. all in all our trip was great and we can't wait to do it again! also bring comfy shoes!!!! i came home with blisters. although everything is right next door, you have to walk a mile or two to get there."
52,303,"Oct 22 2009 	Great place to stay on the company dime.	I enjoyed my stay in Las Vegas for a change. I'm not much for the night life and the casino. This hotel is huge. My room was huge. It seemed a little dated but still very nice. My room had a comfortable king bed, large shower with two shower heads, two bathrooms (one on each side of the shower), large jetted tub, sofa, etc. Everything was clean and in working order. I had a room at the end of the hall and it was actually quiet. So nice.The only staff I dealt with was the front desk at check in and check out. Both were courteous and efficient."
53,303,"Oct 21 2009 	Seasoned Vegas Traveler - Worst Experience Ever	When I arrived on Sunday mid morning I was told no rooms would be available until after 1pm, &quot;unless I wanted to spend $$$ for an upgrade&quot;, I elected to wait. I was there for a show and needed to get into my room. I went back at 1pm and there were approximately 150 people standing in line to check in, I could not wait as I was involved in the conference setting up etc.I did not get my room until 7:15pm and after speaking with others there was as much as a 2 hour wait in line.Valet parking was full as well at 4pm in the afternoon.When checking out I was told I could bypass the line and fill out a card including my email address and they would send the bill in email. After waiting 24 hours I called, after being on hold for 10 minutes I spoke with a billing specialists and they had my email as someone else's.Caesars was the worst experience I've ever had in Las Vegas and I travel there 4-5 times a year. I will never stay there again.Thank you."
54,303,"Oct 18 2009 	best holiday ever	We stayed in caesers with another couple for 10 nights,a bit pricey but no other complaints,cheesecake factory is the best place to eat,good food and big portions reasonable price,perfectly placed on the strip.excellent experience will definately return."
55,303,"Oct 17 2009 	Got money to burn and don't plan to win any- stay here	Husband and I went for 21st wedding anniv. Since this was my 1st time in vegas we thought we would splurge on the room and got the suite with a jumbo spa tub. That was very nice, it fills up very quickly. The shower head in the stand up glass door shower (very nice too) was so powerfull that it was like piercing needles so you had to have it barely on or else your scalp would be sore. The mini bar was of course way over prices and they are movment sensitive (including the items on top) so dont pick them up to look at. You can request a mini fridge from housekeeping (no cost) and keep drinks and your own liquors in that (recommended!) buy your sodas, snacks from the walgreens or CVS stores- much cheaper!!! Liquor in the malls at the ABC stores are also much cheaper. The machines don't pay off nearly as much as the Freemont street ones. The tables are higher bets than the smaller casino's. If you want to eat cheaper try Burker king inside Osheas for breakfast or walk a little further to Denny's. Inside bill's casino (across the street) is a nice resturant to get a large breakfast for under $10 each. Look out for breakfast deals in the mall dining places ($3.95-$10) while you are walking around and make note of those. Lunch is another thing we would usually not eat much for lunch since we were so full from breakfast. The pool areas looked nice- but we didn't go in them. While gambling on slots I hardly ever saw a cocktail waitress and even though I tipped her I wouldn't see her again. The drinks are also VERY weak- hince buy your own liquor and drink that while getting ready to go out! If I ever return to vegas I will stay at a cheaper casino and use the money for shows and better food choices for dinners, and gambling."
56,303,"Oct 16 2009 	Great stay but extremely expensive!!	Stay at Caeser's from September 28th -Oct 3rd. When we arrived at 7:30 Pm I was told that our room was not ready yet. We then decided to go to the Diamond lounge and get a drink and something to eat because we were starving with the long flight from Phila. After going back to check on our room they said it would be another 1/2 hour, so we went to look around the hotel. The hotel is huge and has allot to see. we wanted to get aquainted with our surroundings since we heard is was difficult to navigate. In reading past reviews we were a liitle bit nervous with our room. We finally got our key's and went up to our room to be very happy. We were in the Augustus tower room 3370. It was right near the elevator and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains outside our window, The rooms are like mimi suites. very large, has a couch and a few chairs, and the bathroom was awsome. Had a juccuzi tub, shower and TV in the bathroom so when you are taking a bath you can watch TV. rooms were very clean. As for the prices of food, come on give me a break!! I am by no means a cheap person, but $17.00 for a cheeseburger at the Cafe is crazy. Needless to say we ate elsewhere.As for the pool the way they designed the two newer towers is rediculous. You don't get any sun at all at the pool until 12:30 Pm. I sat at the pool for over 3 hours waitiing, and waiting, and waiting. They don't have enough chairs either. If you get down there in the afternoon to go to the pool, good luck trying to find a lounge chair. and oh by the way the drink prices are crazy too. $14.00 for a small drink and $22.00 for a large. That's why I brought a few beers in a small bag with ice to the pool. The sports book is huge and had allot of fun there. If you play keno they give you free drink coupons which came in handy considering the prices of drinks. All in all it was a great place to stay, very clean and comfortable.We were celebrating our anniversary and had a great time. Vegas will wear you out so bring good walking shoes and be ready to party!!!"
57,303,"Oct 15 2009 	Luxe suite makes stay superb	We were booked into a luxe suite w/ foyer, powder room, wet bar, living room, dining room, large bedroom, and large bathroom. My partner is well loved by the casinos and they offer fine things to keep you coming back for more. This suite would do it for me. The view wasn't the finest, but the room was absolutely superb. It was in one of the older towers near the Cleopatra Bar barge, but it was updated, contemporary, and s p a c i o u s. A bit of a walk to the pool, but no problem. I want to replicate the shower in my home--good size and well laid out. A walk-in closet in the bathroom made our few hanging items look like they were in an in-room suite. Very comfortable."
58,303,"Oct 14 2009 	Greatjust don't gamble here!	Spent four days at Caesar's with husband and another couple. We have been to Vegas several times before and decided to stay at Caesar's because we never had and wanted to experience the kitsch. :) (like Disneyworld for adults)The place is very impressive and more to see than we had time for-and unbelievably HUGE! I knew not to take my &quot;pretty&quot; shoes,but rather the walking shoes-good thing,too! From our room in the Palace Tower to the Flamingo,across the street was about a mile hike. Our room was large,lovely and comfortable. Beware the weight-sensitive mini-bar and amenties on top of the bar they want you to buy. $8 m&amp;m's,seriously! With this type of luxury place you don't get a coffee pot,micro or fridge (that's dedicated to the mini-bar). My dear hubby hiked down to Payard's each morning and got me a $6 cup of coffee. Everyone was friendly except for the dealers who seemed not to like their jobs. Hubby plays craps and there was never anything but $25 tables. I never saw them busy or noticed anybody winning at anything,actually. We went across the street to the Flamingo to gamble where it was much more exciting with $5 and $10 tables. The craps crew at the F were surprized when we told them about the (mostly empty) $25 tables at Caesar's! They are both owned by Harrahs,I understand. We also went downtown to gamble and hubby won big at his favorite-Binion's. We had brunch at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill (at Caesar's) and it was good-not as good as last time's meal at Wolfgang Puck's Bistro,tho'(at the MGM). All food we encountered at C's was very expensive. We were seated at Beijing Noodle #9 for dinner and after about 10 minutes with no service at all got up and left-they never even noticed. At the Seafood restaurant we were warmly welcomed and had great service and good food,tho' it is more Asian than seafood. Another meal was at a diner type place at the Flamingo-we were ready for a burger and it was good. We had dinner at Caesar's Augustus Cafe one night. As far as I know,it is the only 24-hr place to eat at C's. It was not very good with fair to poor service.Notes: It is very dry in Vegas,I couldn't moisturize enough,or get enough to drink. A 16 oz. (I think) soft drink at the shop in the lobby is $3.95. I tried to buy soda out of the machines on 2 floors-neither worked. Could they be trying to force you to buy those $6 drinks from the mini-bar?We rented a car because we went to Hoover Dam one day. Driving on the Strip is horrible-take a taxi or limo if you can. It took forever to get our car from the airport rental place and make it to the hotel."
59,303,"Oct 13 2009 	Surreal experience	It took me a long time to understand this whole 'Vegas Experience' , but it was certainly not what I expected. I booked Ceasars simply because of the name and the history. I expected high rollers, tuxedo's, show's starring Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin, that sense of a real piece of American history, that I as a European had not experienced before. At first I was bitterly disapointed in Vegas, there was no glamour, this really is a Kitsch city, and caesars the most kitsch hotel I have ever stayed in. The mental picture of glamour was instantly replaced by poor Mexican's handing out leaflets advertising porn and adult services, the tuxedo's relaced by baseball caps and shorts, The million dollar gambling tables replaced by 1000's of 25 cent slot machines. The beutiful people replaced by average americans with their large cups full of quarters. Then I got it, Las Vegas is not meant to be glamour, it is meant to be kitsch, infact it is meant to be the absolute pinnicle of kitsch, and you know what Caesars delivers it perfectly. Caesars and Vegas delivers a completely different experience to anywhere else in the world, complete with talking statues. You can see why this place is so popular with ordinary people, stag and hen parties, and the bemused foreigner, it provides a totally different experience based on excess, and fantasy.The rooms were fine, quite ordinary compared wit the rest of the hotel, and the service completely corporate and delivered to perfection. With the strength of the Euro against the Dollar, I found it to be reasonably priced, and we ate well in the various restaurants.Was it all for me? well no, and I have no intention of ever going back to this city. If you want this whole 'Vegas Experience' then I would actually recommend Caesars, it delivers it perfectly."
60,303,"Oct 12 2009 	Very Relaxing....everything we needed in one hotel!	My husband and I stayed here for 4 days back in '07. I've told myself to write a review, but just never have! We did a lot of research on hotels on the strip, and decided to go with Caesar's Palace. We thought they had a great gambling/casino area, and the shopping mall is wonderful! The restaurants are top-notch! We never have eaten so well....honestly! Of course, we spent a little more on meals, but we felt it was well worth it. If that's not what you want to do, then there are other options for you.....but I would say a lot of the nicer restaurants here are more on the &quot;pricey&quot; side. But we were ok with that. The pools were great, and room was comfortable and very clean. Caesar's Palace is a gorgeous hotel and really gets 2 thumbs up from us!"
61,303,"Oct 12 2009 	Rain Man Suite at Caesar's	We were upgraded to the Rain Man suite and it was amazing. They do provide you with many outlets to make noise, ipod stations, big screens, but they will send security if you are too loud. We had a great time."
62,303,"Oct 11 2009 	Excellent accomidations	Room service was great, limo pick up etc. Hotel pool was excellent."
63,303,"Oct 10 2009 	At Caesars Palace	Probably you just heard about caesars palace as a box arena, but it was the best hotel creation around greek and rome culture... each place in the hotel remembers this... statues, colosseum, mall, all of them are stunning...In addition, you will be correctly placed in the vegas strip! near to all!"
64,303,"Oct 9 2009 	Great Stay..	Stayed in the Forum Tower in one of the newly renovated rooms. The room was great, no complaints, except maybe the view of the parking garage, but it didn't bother us. Housekeeping, drink service, and front desk all went above and beyond. Did Caesars buffet, it was OK, nothing special. The food court is convenient when you want to grab something quick. Overall, we had a great stay at Caesars and will be back. You will not be disappointed if you stay here."
65,303,"Oct 9 2009 	Location opulence and service can't be beat!!!	Our room was in the Augustus tower, room 2968 to be exact. Had a perfect strip view of the Bellagio fountains and Paris. The room was spotless, new, the bed was huge and comfy, and the bathroom was as large as the room our friend had at the Imperial Palace. The casino was large and airy (also VERY lively). Every employee we encountered was friendly and courteous. I also found the slots here very loose. Planning my next trip to Vegas already, and I will definetly stay here again."
66,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Great rooms excellent location	Caesar's is located extremely conveniently on the Las Vegas Strip - lots to do around and easy access to other great casinos. The shopping area is fantastic and the free shows are fun. The room was great - and clean - although the bathroom was smaller than expected. Great service,. friendly staff. Definitely recommend staying here."
67,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Classy hotel with wonderful theming but incredibly expensive	I stayed in an Augustus Tower room back during my first (and until this November, only) trip to Vegas for a wedding. The rooms were ungodly expensive, even pricey after dividing the price by 3 since I shared a room with two friends. Still, I must say the rooms were incredibly impressive and worth every penny. Extremely spacious and elegantly decorated. The bathroom itself was nearly as big as my bedroom at home, and had an enormous jetted tub, walk in shower, vanity with two sinks and a separate closet for the toilet. It was one of the the best hotel rooms I've ever stayed in, though the mattresses could have been a little softer. That said, from what I saw of a regular base level room (which they call Classic), I can't imagine that it'd be worth staying in this hotel if you weren't splurging on one of the more expensive rooms. The base level rooms weren't much better than a room at any run of the mill chain hotel yet are rented at rates higher than much of the strip. Caesars has one of the greatest locations of any of the resorts on the strip. Right in the middle of everything so walking to other resorts isn't as arduous as it could be. And that's if you even decide to leave the resort. Caesars has some of the best shopping in the area, the Forum Shops is easily my favorite shopping center on the strip. Lots of great restaurants are here, the spa is absolutely fabulous (even just paying the $45 to use the facilities at Qua is worth it, though for that much you ought to just get a treatment as their staff is wonderful), the pools are gorgeous and their show rooms host plenty of big name entertainers. It'd be very easy to check in here for a long weekend and never find a reason to leave the property.All and all, I'd have to say this is an excellent resort, though probably out of the price range of many travelers (myself included) as there are plenty of hotels nearby that offer rooms that are just as nice (or in the case of base level rooms, much better) for less. If you do have the opportunity to stay here though, I'm sure you won't regret it."
68,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Great stay at Caesars.............	Stayed here for 6 nights at the end of Sept,Palace tower, very large room.2 queen beds and asked for another, no problem, delivered in mins,.Towels changed every day and beds changed on request,excellent service.Ordered room service for breakfast 2 mornings,delivered in 30 mins.We has 5 nights comped so didnt expect to get such a nice room.The Palace tower was nearest the pool which was wnother bonus.Plenty of towels at the pool,but be down early to get a bed.Really enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying here again."
69,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Caesar's is a great hotel	Caesar's Palace was a great hotel to stay at. We stayed in suites in the new Augustus Tower. It's really convienently located and the room was beautiful. I'm a fan of any place with a television in the bathroom. We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains. The room was very big and had a whirlpool bathtub. The tower had it's own smaller casino, and was connected to all the other areas, including the pool (which was great) and shopping.As to be expected with any hotel in Vegas, it's smoky and loud downstairs, but we had no such troubles in our room!The staff was great and incredibly helpful in finding directions and shows, and bringing extra towels! The service is very quick. I recommend this hotel!"
70,303,"Oct 8 2009	Beautiful hotel with a lot to offer!	This hotel was fantastic! The rooms were spacious and beds were comfortable. There were several swimming pools as well as the Forum Shops and plenty of restuarants and nightlife. The only thing that we didn't care for was the smoking. We got a non-smoking room, but you could still smell smoke in the room. Overall, a great vacation!!"
71,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Great Pool and Perfect Location	We stayed at Caesar's Palace in the Roman Tower - the older tower. The rooms were nice, but not much different than rooms at New York New York or Paris. We heard the newer towers are nicer. The pool was great though! They have several pools actually, and we played Black Jack in the water - it was perfect since it was 99 degrees and we didn't want to be stuck inside all day. The hotel is in a perfect location - right next to the Bellagio and Mirage, and close to several older casinos that have lower minimum betting. We had a great trip!"
72,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Great room friendly staff. Uneven service	Our clerk at check-in was friendly, funny and helpful. He upgraded us to a mini-suite in the Palace Tower since our reserved deluxe room in the Forum Tower was unavailable. The room was very large and well-appointed with a great view of the pools. Two bathrooms, too. We used room service twice and the servers were also friendly and helpful. Service issues:1. There is only one person stationed at the &quot;Leisure Concierge&quot; desk. There were often lines and we gave up waiting on one occasion. Caesar's should have tripled the staffing to match the size of the hotel.2. Our room service tray was left in the hall for at least 36 hours. With old food on it. Otherwise we had no problems.Other:This hotel is expensive. Drinks, food, shops and table minimums. Be prepared so you aren't shocked. We played blackjack across the street at Bill's and enjoyed it there."
73,303,"Oct 8 2009 	Very disappointed	I stayed at Caesars Palace a few years ago while attending a conference and was very impressed. This time, I was very disappointed. The carpet was frayed, the bathroom walls had not been cleaned, I had to call room service for ice every day, the ethernet did not work, etc. When I checked out and expressed my disappointment I was given petty excuses."
74,303,"Oct 6 2009 	going downhill	We`ve been to Caesars every year for the last twenty-odd years, so it pains me to write this but....It seems to me, that unless you`re part of a huge group, or willing to pay out for lots of extras, they`re not really interested anymore.For example, if you want to sit by the pool, there are plenty of sunbeds but they`re all behind the double beds and canopied beds that, of course, cost extra. Also, one afternoon, we went down for a swim at around 4.50 pm to be told that all the pools and the whole area was closing at 5pm for a private function.This has happened to us before and I urge you all to complain to the duty manager if it happens to you. We did and received 100 dollars to spend on food and drink as compensation, but it really isn`t good enough. There are 4 pools - why not just close one or two.Yes, the rooms are lovely (we stay in the Augustus Tower) and the location is great, but next year we`ll be looking at alternatives because we`re fed up of being treated as if we`re not important."
75,303,"Oct 4 2009 	Pools and Cabana Not What We Expected	Husband and I went to Caesars Palace for the experience of the new pools at the god of the gardens pool complex. What a joke ! The new pools, which were the only ones in the sun ( and it was very cool in the shade) were closed the whole time we were thereMonday thru Thursday. People were wrapped in towels at the pools in the shade hoping that the sun at some point would be over them.We paid $300.00 for a cabana that did not even have a thin rope to separate it from the public. People were sitting right on top of us. One woman tried to sit on one of our chairs. (because there were no chairs available at the five pool complex) So Disappointed !Thank God for the Spa ! We ended up spending most of our time there."
76,303,"Oct 4 2009 	Again - a wonderful time at Caesars	We were at Caesars from Sept.23 to 30th and stayed in the Palace Tower (room 2344)and had a wonderful time. The first night it was so overbooked that they had to put us in the Roman tower, which from all reviews had me worried. It was actually not a bad room at all - mind you it is smaller and a bit dated but the walls were thick enough that we heard no noise at all. The next day they moved us to the Palace Tower which we requested because it is so close to the swimming pools which makes it the best location for us. We had two bathrooms in our room and the room was large, overlooking the pool area. We had ample towels and no problems at all, other than the housecleaning staff was a bit slow and could be cleaning a bit better, but the bed sheets were clean, and towels where plenty. We asked and received a small fridge for our left overs from our meals, which the next day made great sandwiches for lunch. We also asked for an extra cot which arrived free of charge. Finally the pools are complete and the new cabanas and day beds add a nice look to all the pools. The water was clean and warm - I do agree that the beds are a bit too close to each other, but people do spread out. We ate twice at the Mesa Grill, and once at Bradley Ogden - both are excellent. We also enjoy the food around the pool. One night we went to the Hofbrauhaus for Octoberfest celebrations and had a really fun evening. The keg-meister that evening was Lance Burton and he was very friendly and approachable. The food there was good German down home cooking and their staff was very friendly and helpful with explaining all the dishes. Another evening we ate at the Rio, at their Indian restaurant, and the food was delicious. We left the ordering up to the waiter, and he did a great job of giving us a good cross selection of delectible dishes. If you like sea bass, they did this one dish that I thought was amazing! We went to see Penn &amp; Teller and I don't know if it was an off evening - but I didn't think they were all that good - Penn talked too much and talked very quickly and it was hard to understand him - I could have used less talking and more magic.In the end, everyone at Caesar's was curteous, friendly and professional. We go twice a year and have never had anything but the best - no complaints.They will see me again in April."
77,303,"Oct 4 2009 	Terrible Hotel Rooms and Customer Service	I stayed at Caesars Palace for three nights while attending a business conference. At first, I was assigned a room in the Centurion Tower. The room was clean, but very dated and the mattresses were VERY hard. I would have been better off sleeping on the floor! The room view was terrible and looked straight into the a/c units. This caused it to be very loud at night. I could not sleep at all so very late that night I got dressed and went to the reservation area to see if I could be moved to another room. The employee stated that they did not have any rooms other than suites available. First off, they were incredibly rude and obviously hated their jobs. Second, she said they could upgrade me to a suite for $200 more per night. At this point, I was traveling alone so there was obviously no need for a suite. I just wanted a quiet room with a comfortable bed. I then asked what was available the next night. I was able to upgrade my room for $50 more a night. The room I was upgraded to was nice and the bed was comfortable, but still not worth what they are charging for the room. In addition, I paid $14.99 for 24 hours of internet service that could only be used in my room. When I switched rooms, they tried to tell me that I would have to purchase the internet again. I was persistent and refused to pay for the service again when I still had 12 + hours I already paid for. They did adjust the bill for this issue, but were rather rude in the process. The amenities at this hotel are nice and the business conference area was very nice. Before the conference, my husband and I stayed at Treasure Island and had a very nice experience. In addition, the bill for three nights at Treasure Island was less than half the amount of the hotel bill for Caesars Palace. I hardly ever leave comments about hotels, but my experience at Caesars Palace was awful and I felt it needed to be shared so others do not have to go through a similar experience. The hotel's employees seem to forget that they are working in the hospitality industry. There are too many other options in Vegas and I will not return to Caesars Palace."
78,303,Oct 3 2009 	Nice big rooms	The room we had was with two queen size beds and still the extra space was more than enough to accomodate the five of us in the room. They also had a nice shower head where you can use as a hand held shower head or attach it on a small pole and move it up and down to fit you from head to toe.
79,303,"Oct 2 2009 	Wonderful Visit with beautiful room casino and grounds	Arrived Sept. 23 for a 5 night stay. Check-in and Registration person was great and pleasant. Stayed in an Augustus Tower Room. My room's location had great day and night views!!! of the Bellagio and the Fountain Show, Bally's, Paris' Eiffel Tower and their Balloon/Globe, Planet Hollywood, the newly almost completed City Center, and a distant view of the MGM Grand.My room had a King Bed, brown-velvet sofa with coffee table, a comfortable chair with ottoman, 36&quot; diameter wood table with 2 chairs, desk with chair, 2 LCD TVs (one in room and other in bath), 3 1/2' x 7' gold-framed mirror, 6' Wooden storage base with Refreshment Bar, a 10' x 14' well-appointed marble bath with coffiered ceiling, jetted? soaking tub, separate 3' x 4' glass-enclosed shower, a separate commode are with door, 6' Granite top Vanity with double sinks along with Twin Mirrors with 3 light Sconzes and many towel racks.After getting to my room, I noticed there was not a mini-fridge in the room. Before I called downstairs, the front-desk person who checked me in called my room phone to ask if I liked my room. I said everything was perfect, except I noticed there is no mini-fridge and I like to have one in a room. She immediately had one sent up to my room which was delivered (to my surprise) within 10 minutes after our phone conversation. Now that is what I call Great and Considerate Service!Housekeeping services appeared sufficient; always had fresh towels. However after the first couple of nights I had to leave a note requesting more soap which was a first-time experience as a guest. Housekeeping then left in the bathroom a plastic bag filled with a bunch of soap...LOL...all I wanted was a couple new bars.Pool area was nice, but chaises are too close to one another. Advise you get there about 9:30 a.m. for a spot.This establishment's grounds and facilities are beautifully done and maintained in my opinion. Huge wide-open rotunda in Registration area with center statutes. Convenient front-entrance taxi/shuttle services...no walking to some far and obscure area.I can't comment on Caesars Palace's dining establishments. I dined at my favorites. For you younger folks, there are a number of nightclubs/bars at this establishment...very active especially over the weekend...which seemed monitored by security personnel.Slots are very tight with little or smaller payouts than other casinos within Las Vegas; plentiful table games open.I saw Cher at Caesars Colosseum; great show and costumes though I was a bit surprised it only lasted an hour and fifty minutes. I hoped it would go over two hours long. Otherwise, very well put together and highly recommended. If you get to the Palazzo/Venetian, see Jersey Boys (based on Franki Vali and the Four Seasons) if you haven't yet seen it. The show is based on their life story and includes all their songs. However, see this show when Rick Faugno is performing (Friday's and Saturday's) as Franki Vali because his voice is much more spectacular (his vocals stand out more) than the other performer's voice.I really enjoyed my vacation stay here at Caesars Palace. The only negative I have is that I seemed to have better players luck at other establishments and very little or none at Caesars; maybe this experience here I was unlucky. Just seemed rather wierd. That's Vegas for you."
80,303,"Oct 2 2009 	Great Location but easiy not the best anymore!	Great Location on the strip,but I agree with a previous reviewer,you get what you pay for,it was somewhere to put your head,and lets face it you dont go to Las Vegas to sit in your room! and we stayed here mainly as we were seeing Bette Midler at the colosseum.The rooms arereasonably clean with okay service.nothing to shout about if you have stayed with other hotel brands around the world in my opinion it is very average and needs a lot of updating.Food prices are the usual rip off although it is possible to eat for a reasonable price if you look around.Las Vegas is great though for a few days though"
81,303,"Oct 1 2009 	An amazing hotel at the heart of Las Vegas!	We stayed in Caesar's Palace for two nights of our seven night trip and it was probably our favourite hotel. It is just as you imagine - great service in a very grand environment. The staff were all very friendly and helpful; the bathrooms were enormous with huge baths and seperate showers; the casino is massive and there are many events to see (we recommend Cher even as non fans she was amazing!).The Forum shops are part of the hotel and there are loads to choose from.There is loads to do at night including the shows, clubs, bars and the casinos.We highly recommend this hotel."
82,303,"Oct 1 2009 	Very big place	Stayed 3 nights for a family wedding and being late June it was very hot outside but nice and cool in the hotel.Have nothing but praise for our room in the Palace Tower but housekeeping were very slow in cleaning room service food trays and glasses from the corridor floors.The hotel is enormous and it takes an age to walk from reception to the Palace Tower. Both checking in and out were relatively quick operations. Had the breakfast buffet which is not cheap but good but did not eat in any of the other restaurants as we were too busy sightseeing outside of the hotel.The shopping mall was very big but quite expensive, really interesting decor on the ceiling/roof with some interesting moving statue shows. Ample free car paking in the hotel. Not impressed by the swimming pools - they are over detailed and intricate and the sun beds are jammed tight together, we prefer more natural free form swimming pools.Overall a good place although if we go again would like to try the Bellagio."
83,303,"Sep 30 2009 	What a brilliant holiday!!!!	I have just returned from a long weekend in Vegas with my husband and friends. It was a fantastic trip and could be rated as one of my best holidays! We stayed in Caesars Palace and after reading the reviews on here I was very worried as to what to expect. There were several reviews saying how grubby and run down it was????Not our experience - on arrival I asked for a complimentary upgrade and they said one had already been applied. The room was lovely, clean, modern and although our view was of the back of the hotel, it was still a view. We stayed in the palace tower and paid about 350 for 3 nights through a travel agents. The hotel has a really nice vibe, people are very friendly and it went on for miles! Being a bit of a self proclaimed snob, I found that being one of the pricier hotels attracted better clientel. After looking round the other hotels, I would suggest Caesars, The Venetian and The Bellagio. Drinks are really expensive at about $9 each, so make sure you make the best of free drinks when gambling.Places to visit - Caesars Palace - The cheesecake factory. Either eat a main or dessert, nnot sure you will manage both!The Venetian - The Gondola rides. Very expensive and short but worth a look at the indoor canals, beautiful!The Mirage - All you can eat champagne breakfast. Not posh but fab food and we didn't need to eat until 11pm that night! The exploding volcano, outside and explodes every hour from 8-12.The Parisian - Mon Ami Gabi. The best breakfast I have ever had, great service and bottomless drinks. I had the chocolate and bacon waffle which stunned me into silence, a real must-try.The MGM - Free lion attraction, great for kids and big kids alike. KA the show, pretty expensive but mind blowing and had us gasping for breath at the stunts.The Stratasphere - The rides at the top are great, do them in the dark for best effect. We also had dinner at the 'Top of the World ' restaurant. Great views, good service but really pricey. $300 for 4 of us for just mains and a bottle of wine. Try it as a treat if you dont go on a helicopter.The Bellagio - The fountain goes off through the day, but come alive at night! They go off every 15 mins and are fabulous, another freebie! The dress code in here was a bit more upmarket and most girls were in dresses.One last top tip - the taxi from the airport to caesars cost us $30 on the way to the hotel and $11 on our trip back.... done over as usual for being a tourist. Ask for the direct route and say that you have been before so they dont con you.p.s. everyone wants a tip and some will ask you for one. Dont be a woss and pay a taxi driver if he doesnt do a good job, we had one who wouldn't accept our payment until we added a tip - tell them where to go, you wont see them again!All in all, we would go back tomorrow. Fantastic!!!"
84,303,"Sep 30 2009 	Disappointing	The reception process was a brutal and bruising experience. We were not given the room that had been reserved on our behalf by our UK tour operator. The room that we were given was 633 in the Palace Tower, not the expected room in the Forum Tower. The furniture in 633 wasbattered and bruised, the paintwork was covered in a thick layer of dust. One of the wardrobe doors was hanging off. The coridor immediately outside our room was variously strewn with dirty plates empty beer bottles, and for a long time there was a &quot;Commode&quot; was left in the corridor. To get to the Palace Tower elevators outside the Palace Pool area, we constantly had to fight our through large groups of drunken men, intimidating guests going for the elevators. The House standards were disgraceful. This Hotel is so grossly overpriced for the service for the level of service displayed it is insulting to any visiting tourist.NEVER AGAIN"
85,303,"Sep 30 2009 	SHOCKED 	Booked for 7 nights the room we booked was totaly unexceptable, shower blocked then all this black junck coming up through the drains! no backs on the the draws so clothes just fell through to the next draw, the entrance door was not fitted well with a 2 inch gap at one end.We were then upgraded to a great room with extra cost incured by US.Upgrade was great untill we tried to sleep. The suite next door was party central for a least 4 of the 7 night stay with the music not loud but blaring.After the last complaint to reception the extra cost for the upgrade was wavered.At no time were we contacted by any staff member in any position to see if the situation could be resolved (The duty manger was even invited up to our room by us to wittnes the party going on next door, that was a no show.) At last checking out, the receptionist was not aware of the room waver and put it on our account after she was informed by me of the waver, she then had to contact whoever to sort this problem out WHAT A MESS. At no time were we asked by any staff member at Ceasers about our VERY VERY unsatifactory stay, o'h i lie a female valet attendant did ask us about our stay when she retrived our car.This was our third visit to vegas, and we did splash out to stay at Ceasers. &quot;NOT HAPPY JAN&quot;"
86,303,"Sep 29 2009 	Best Hotel anywhere	This hotel has everything you could possibly ask for. It's an amazing place and won't let you down. No pictures, movies or internet sites will do this hotel justice. Seeing is believing and it is a must for everyone. The location is perfect, the staff are brilliant, the casino is exceptional and the clubs are fantastic. I was blown over and still reeling now I'm home. If I'm lucky enough to get back to Vegas I will stay here."
87,303,Sep 28 2009 	You get what you pay for!	Staff was better than most. Room was great. Food was way expensive!!! $25.00 minimum table games?? Nice place to stay. Eat and gamble somewhere else!
88,303,"Sep 28 2009 	Horrible Customer Service...Will not reimburse unauthorized purchase	I returned from Caesar's palace and found that $75 was charged to my Visa from the snack bar snackus maximus even though I did not make any purchases there and wasn't even in Las Vegas the day these were charged to my Visa. I was extremely disappointed when I contacted Harrah's my only two options for filing a complaint were through email or via a voicemail. I have contacted them numerous times without a response. I will never again stay at a Harrah's property. I am lucky I was only $75 was stolen from my credit card. By the time I noticed it on my Visa it was two late to launch an investigation. If this is how they treat customers, imagine if how they will treat you if a more serious problem occurs."
89,303,"Sep 28 2009 	Not Safe Stay Away	Do no stay here, thats my advice. Its not a safe hotel. While asleep someone entered my room with a Hotel key and robbed me. The Hotel claim its not their fault, despite the fact a Hotel key was used. I had my key so the only answer is the Hotel the allowed someone gain access to my room. I have received no compensation in any form from the Hotel. The hotel claim I should have used the safe, but who uses a safe at night to put your wallet , purse and watches away while in the room? I was lucky I was asleep during the robbery if I woke up anything could have happened to me. If you stay here you may not be as lucky. Do not stay here"
90,303,"Sep 28 2009 	Great hotel fantastic location pity about the service	If you're staying in Vegas then Caesar's is probably in one of the best locations, roughly in the middle of the strip. While there is a bus service that stops at all of the casino's on the strip its often quicker to walk, which made Caesar's a winner in that regard.The rooms were well kept, even had a little TV in the bathroom! Very spacious and a massive bed. The pool was amazing, with a true Roman feel and plenty of places to just relax and unwind. The hotel itself is very grand and the internal architecture is quite impressive.However, you should forget about using the internet to check your emails etc unless you're happy to fork out $0.50/min.Unfortunately we found the service at Caesar's to be almost non-existant. If you want to speak to the concierge expect to wait on average 20 minutes, and in all instances but once they were far from helpful. How a hotel the size of Caesar's can only have 1 concierge is beyond me!After our room key malfuntioned it took approx 40mins to eventually get into the room after waiting at the front desk and then waiting for security - a process that would take most hotels no more than 10 mins...."
91,303,"Sep 26 2009 	Great pool but hotel is old and it's obvious--not the best in vegas!	My boyfriend and I stayed at Caesar's Palace while in town for my cousin's wedding. We were very excited to stay here, especially since the movie &quot;The Hangover&quot; and had just come out. Needless to say, the movie makes the hotel look a hell of a lot nicer than it is. Don't get me wrong, the lobby is pristine, the pool is immaculate and the forum shops are of course amazing. We spent almost every night dining at some of the fantastic restaurants in the forum shops, like Il Mulino, Boa Steakhouse, Sushi Roku and Spago. If not for the forum shops we would have been very disappointed.Our room was old and not kept well. It was a standard suite, and had a great view of the pool, but the bed was uncomfortable and had an old pink comforter like a motel. The bathroom was all marble and beautiful, except for one major problem---there was no door!!! Thankfully my boyfriend and I have been together long enough for this not to be a deal-breaker, but we were still uncomfortable with using the facilities with the other person in the same room and no door. Also, one afternoon water started pouring out of the ceiling vent above our toilet. We called down immediately and maintainence told us that it was from the room upstairs' tub overflowing. Obviously there was nothing they could have done to prevent this, but it still left a bad taste in our mouths. The spa there was amazing. It had several roman baths and jacuzzi's, and even had an arctic room which is set at 55 degrees and has fake snow! It was incredibly beautiful and relaxing.We were expecting a lot more from Caesar's Palace and unfortunately our expectations weren't met. The first night we arrived there was a group of housekeeping carts being stored on our floor right by our room. We called down to let them know and they said they would move them. The same thing happened the second night, only the carts were never moved. This happened every night of our 5 night stay and we complained several times. The casino was old and dreary. All of the dealers looked as if they had one foot in the grave (or wished they did) and the whole set up was very cheesy. The forum shops casino, however, was beautiful. The regular caesar's casino had very low ceilings and not a lot of things to do.The location of Caesar's was great--it's right in the middle of everything. But for the location, the Bellagio right next door was ten times as nice. My dad and his girlfriend were staying there and we wanted to be there all the time. The casino was beautiful and huge, the restaurants were yummy and trendy and it even had a better nightlife than Caesar's.We also visited the famous club Pure at Caesar's but it was not much to look at. It was extremely crowded and filled with really pretentious people. We are from Boca Raton, FL which is arguably one of the snobbiest places in the country, so we are definitely familiar with this crowd, but still had a hard time stomaching the one in Pure. Wouldn't recommend it but it was great for the awesome $90/night rate that we got. If you want luxury, stay at the Bellagio, Wynn, or even the new Palazzo."
92,303,"Sep 26 2009 	Great hotel centrally located on strip	Checkin went very good, short line and we were given a great room. Because we booked through Hotwire I was affraid we would get an old room but instead we got a newly renovated Deluxe Palace Tower Room in the Palace tower. An upgrade to a small suite was offered to us, but because we would not spend that much time in our room we did not do this.We had to find our way through the Casino to the elevator, and when arriving at the room we really liked it. It had a separate room where you could put your suitecases, and a huge bathroom with a 2 person jacuzi. The rest of the room (TV and bed) were also big enough for us. The windows are from ground to ceiling so we had a great view over the strip and the rest of the city, especially at night.Selfparking was easy, the parking garage is large and you can park your car near the elevator which leads you into the casino. Also the shops (Forum Shops) are great to see but a little bit expensive. The Apple store was also there.We only had breakfast once in the hotel, there are several counters where you can buy different kind of foods, and also over here the personel is very helpful.The location is perfect, when you walk out of the hotel, you are in no time in The Venetian, Paris, Bellasio, Treasure Island etcetera. If you have an hotel which is further down the strip it is a long walk to get to the central strip. You can than take the monorail but we did not find the Vegas monorail very convenient as it's stations are on the back of the hotels that are on the other side of the strip of Caesars. So we walked around the casino's and saw all the fabulous things in the hotels (aquarium, canalboats, lions, rollercoasters).The swimming pool is very luxureus, it has multiple pools includinf one in which you can play poker! This is something like i've never seen before! Checkout using the TV was possible so this was a very convenient and fast way, no queues!Next time we will visit Vegas, we definitely book Caesars again!"
93,303,"Sep 26 2009 	Incredible Spa!	We stayed at Caesars recently for my husband's birthday with four other couples. We have stayed at most of the major Las Vegas hotels over the past 15 years and liked them all, however Caesars was a step above the rest. The pool was gorgeous, and not as hectic as some of the others. The Spa was unbelievable, and completely transcended us off the Vegas strip. The Roman bath was fabulous, and especially the Arctic room, where moisturizer fell from the ceiling."
94,303,"Sep 25 2009 	Great Hotel with wonderful service.	I stayed in a Deluxe room in the Augustus Tower 9/20 through 9/24. The room was large with TVs in both the bedroom and bath. Shower, double sinks and tub . Clean room with nice toiletries and robes. Check In clerks were very nice and helpful. Casinos were nice and clean as was the room. Room Service was great and the food expensive but tasty. Service through the stay was great. I would highly recommend this hotel."
95,303,Sep 25 2009 	Awesome Room 	Stayed from Sept 16-20. When we got in to check-in we had a room reserved in Forum Tower after giving the clerk my credit card gave her the $20 trick for an upgrade and got upgraded to the Palace Tower. While our room was already comped $20 got us a fabulous room with jacuzzi and marble bathroom view of pool and slighted view of Bellagio watershow. Best part was our elevator door was a short distance to pool. Didn't do any gambling in casino loved blackjack at pool it was great. Overall very expensive but just a short walk to Harrahs where we did most of gambling O Sheas and Flamingo close by. Caesars is expensive but you dont have to make it break you there are other options nearby for food gambling and fun
96,303,"Sep 25 2009	This Hotel Sucks Bigtime....biggest Ripoff in Vegas.	I paid $495 for the worse room I have sleep in for some time.I checked in late (about 11.30pm) I had been travelling for over 40 hours. The shock came after opening the door to my room on the 6th floor .The towels were dirty...the bath had grime and a layer of dirt I had to clean before taking a shower. There was NO door to the bathroom...the shower was not working.The room was musty and dirty...I took one dirty towel to the check-in desk and the girl who checked me in had a stupid silly smirk all over her face. She told me there were NO other rooms available...I found out in the morning this was a lie.I had booked via a 1-800 number (free) only to find they bill you $11.50 to take a reservation over the phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Caesars offered me a Stunning room upgrade if I booked a $100 room on a mail piece they sent me (I have previously stayed at this hotel) .......what I got was a dirty, old style TV, filthy, no bathroom door pace that I would think twice about leaving a dog there.The view from my window was the waste pipes coming from toilets of other rooms.of 294 hotels listed here on Tripadvisor ...........I rate Caesars as last card in the pack."
97,303,"Sep 23 2009 	excellent visit to c elebrate 47th wedding anniversary	We stayed at Caesar's from 9/7-9/12/09 to celebrate our 47th wedding anniversary- We are diamond players therefore was given a room in the Argustus Forum on the 37th floor overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio- it was really beautiful at night to be able to overlook the strip and also see the fountains-We ate lunch 0b 9/11, around 2:45 at the Bellagion buffet and found the food delicious- decor a little dreary but the food was excellent- especially the cream spinach- everything was fresh, hot was hot, cold was cold, and plentiful.This was my 5th trip to Las Vegas but this was one of the most memorable."
98,303,"Sep 22 2009 	Very disappointing	Our trip started out with not being able to check in until almost 5:00 p.m. We arrived in Vegas at 11:30 a.m. and got to the hotel shortly thereafter hoping to be able to check in a little early. Unfortunately, that was not the case. We waited in line only to find out that no rooms were ready and still in the process of being cleaned. We check back twice and finally were able to check in. The next problem was that there were six of us and we wanted three rooms together which they were unable to accommodate. The desk clerk told us the hotel was completely booked. Two rooms were in the Roman Tower and if at all possible, do not stay there. The rooms are a notch BELOW a &quot;old&quot; Holiday Inn. The carpet was worn, we had no view other than a roof top, the pillows were old and lumpy along with the beds, towels worn and scratchy. It was nothing I would have thought. We thought of asking for other rooms, but didn't want to waste any more time with waiting in line and dealing with unfriendly staff.We had to pay $4.00 for a cup a coffee at one of the bars. We had breakfast at one of the restaurants and it end up costing $33.00 for two. We did find the food court and it still was pricey for what you got and nothing special.The other two people got a room in the Centurion Tower and their room and view was a little better. However, their tv went on the fritz and they ended up getting &quot;free&quot; porno - how nice was that??? Especially for two women!!!We couldn't check out via the TV so again, we had to wait in a long line to check out.While I know you don't spend a lot of time in the room, I had really expected a lot more from Caesar's. We did manage to get a fairly good deal using Expedia for the hotel and airfare but our next trip to Vegas we will be staying somewhere else."
99,303,"Sep 22 2009 	It was ok.	Stayed at Caesars over the weekend of 9/18. No wait at check in. We wanted to upgrade from the classic room. I thought they might just offer it but ended up paying an extra $40.00 a night for the room. Room and bathroom were nice but tv in the bathroom did not work. Food, gambling and items at the casino were crazy expensive. Slots seemed very tight and drink service was mediocre. Pool was nice with no construction noise that I noticed. At the end I would have rather paid less and stayed at NYNY, Monte Carlo or the like."
100,303,"Sep 21 2009 	Wonderful time at Caesars	My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at Caesars Palace. I've stayed at the property twice before, but this was my husband's first time. We both had a wonderful stay and loved everything about Caesars Palace. Our room wasn't available when we went to check in so, we were upgraded to the Palace Tower. Our room was great! It was clean, updated, quiet and very comfortable. The room was cleaned early every day by the maid service. One of the best things about Caesars is it's location on the Strip. It's very centrally located and close to all of the casinos that we wanted to check out - Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn, etc.We loved our visit to Caesars and will definitely stay here again whenever we return to Vegas."
101,303,"Sep 21 2009 	Never again!	If you're under 30, you'll probably enjoy Caesars Palace. If you're like us and in your fifties, looking for class, courtesy and good hospitality... you won't find it at Caesars! The majority of the staff, won't give you the time of day; treated folks like a cheap airline, just trying to see how many they can squeeze in. If you're gambling; you're lucky if you see a cocktail waitress any given amount of hours, and then hope they return. If you order any room service, you'll wait over an hour, hope you get what you ordered. It just felt like they don't care or need any business at all. We would &quot;never&quot; book there again!"
102,303,"Sep 20 2009 	Amazing!!	We went to Vegas right after our wedding in August 09 to have a short honeymoon. We stayed 3 nights, 4 days and had a great time!! The resort was absolutely beautiful and the casino was quite clean and did not smell like smoke like some of the other ones. Check-in was relatively quick but my only complaint was that we had to pay $30 per night to be upgraded to a suite even though it was our honeymoon (that was the only &quot;perk&quot; given to us the whole stay). Our room was amazing - a lot nicer than my friend's who had stayed at Caesar's a few weeks before. It was in Augustus Tower which I think is a newer part of the hotel. Wish there had been a fridge in the room though. There were also these boxes/kits that were on the shelf - you had to be careful not to touch them or you would be charged - kind of odd.Caesar's pool area was my favourite part of the stay. We didn't have any trouble getting chairs since people are constantly coming and going. The pools were well maintained and were perfectly chlorinated. The servers were around often enough to get your drink order and the food by the pool was yummy. I found that there were minimal children at this hotel which was really nice. Found the that restaurants were pretty pricey so we went to the Buffet at Caesar's for dinner one night. Food was just okay. I wish we had gone to the Japanese Restaurant there instead. All in all, I would highly recommend a stay here! Like others have said, it is a perfect location on the strip!!"
103,303,"Sep 19 2009 	Fancy place with a lot of action!	During my three visits to Las Vegas so far, I've stayed twice at this hotel and both times in a Deluxe Room in the Augustus Tower. The first time I opened the door to my room, my jaw dropped. While I've stayed at a fair number of fancy hotels all over the world, I'd never stayed in such a nice room before and the view through the panorama windows was awesome.I should, however, mention that one of my colleagues stayed in one of the other towers (can't remember which one) and his room was nothing special.The hotel is over-the-top and has some fantastic restaurants, bars, and shopping. The casino is definitely not one of the cheaper ones so unless you've brought a nice wad of spending money, you probably want to go elsewhere for a casual game of BlackJack etc."
104,303,"Sep 18 2009	Classic Vegas everyone should experience at least once	Mixed views of this hotel. Overall I would recommend, Impeccable rooms, great location on the strip. Classic Vegas style that needs to be seen to be believed. Unbelievable Night clubs and bar scene, great restaurants and the best shopping out there. Just make sure you bring a boat load of cash as EVERYTHING and I mean everything comes at a premium.The service was good but they did not go the extra mile not what I would consider a 5 star hotel level service. Free room upgrades mid week forget it. My vacation package came with a complimentary room upgrade upon availability. I asked for a suite as it was my sons 21st birthday, they wanted an extra $500/night for this... out of my price range. When I didnt agree to his second offer of a different room for $250/night increase he told me that we would have to wait until 5PM to check in ( it was currently 3PM ). Eventually I got a semi upgrade for $80/night and agreed to it to get us checked in.Food wherever we ate was great but overpriced. Fitness center was $25/day or 3 day pass for $50, facilities were good and always had machines available."
105,303,"Sep 18 2009 	Caesars Palace is Vegas at its best	I've been staying at Caesars Palace at least twice a year for the last 25 years and it continues to be one of the best hotels on the strip. The rooms are modern with all the amenities you need for a comfortable to luxurious stay depening on the type of room. I always stay in the Augustus Tower and have never been disappointed. Everything is spotlessly clean and in good working condtion. The bathrooms have a jacuzzi tub and an LCD TV.The property itself is a combination of old Vegas and new Vegas so you get the best of both worlds. The pool complex has just recently been renovated and is easily the best pool complex in Las Vegas . It's a must see if you're staying at the hotel. There's even blackjack in the pool! This is in addtition to some world class restaurants and night clubs. Really, you cant go wrong staying here. I'm looking forward to another 25 years with my favorite hotel in Las Vegas."
106,303,"Sep 15 2009 	Unexpected and wonderful!	Found on Hotwire for $99/night and decided to surprise my mom with a stay here. She had wanted us to stay at the very budget friendly Bill's Gambling Hall across the street, but I just couldn't let that be her first real Vegas trip, so I booked Caesars as a surprise. After reading reviews here I was worried that due to our booking method we would be relegated to one of the older towers and a room in disrepair. At check-in, I slipped $20 between my ID and credit card and asked if any rooms in the Augstus tower were available. We ended up on the 7th floor facing the Bellagio fountains, the room was wonderful with two queen beds, sitting area with a few small chairs, couch and coffee table, and a small dining table as well. Bathroom was spacious, separate shower and DEEP jacuzzi tub were both in good working order. She was shocked and delighted with the surprise switch in accommodations, and overall we couldn't have been happier with the room. Breakfast buffet was pretty good, would recommend heading over to Mirage for the Cravings buffet instead, its about the same price with much more variety and I think higher quality overall. Did not spend too much time on the gaming floor as I go to Vegas mostly to sightsee and go to shows. Hotel valet was quick and courteous and only once was it full during the Cher concert. Not sure if this would be the case during the peak summer months, but you wouldn't catch me dead in Vegas in the 100+ heat anyway! All and all, this was a great stay for a mother-daughter weekend and I would not hesitate to stay again. While not the newest or classiest hotel on the strip, Caesars is a place where you don't have to spend a ton to be treated like a first class visitor, and of course the location can't be beat for the Vegas sightseer or first time visitor!"
107,303,Sep 15 2009 	Right in the middle of Vegas action	Spent 2 nights here at the end of a trip around California. We upgraded our room on arrival to one in the Augustus Tower which had great views of the strip and Bellagio fountains from its nice sitting area. It looked like this area of the hotel had been renovated recently and the room and furnishings were pretty plush and clean with a good bathroom including spa bath. Caesars is right at the heart of the strip so it was easy to see the main sites and the pool was pretty fun with ridiculous levels of roman decoration - caesar is on a podium in the centre of the pool pointing towards the buffet...there is also swim up poker and back jack so you dont need to head to the immense in door gambling hall if you dont want too. Food and drink prices in Caesars were massive however if you arent a big gambler with a poor glass of white wine costing $9 so worth heading to some of the other casinos for drinks if you arent planning to spend loads on the tables
108,303,"Sep 14 2009 	In the Middle of Everything	We come to Vegas a few times a year and this was our first stay at Caesar's Palace. We had gambled enough back in March when we stayed at Paris, Las Vegas (both are member's of Harrah's Total Rewards) that we were able to stay for free. So the value of what we got for only paying about $36 in taxes for 3 nights was pretty high. We were given a room in the Palace Tower on the 23rd floor that overlooked the pools. A good view and the room was very nice with a large bathroom.The best thing about Caesar's Palace is that it is in a great location, right in the middle of the strip. If you want to venture out it's a great starting point. But also, at the same time, if you don't want to leave there is more than enough right there to keep you plenty busy. We like the casino and the large sports book at Caesar's. We're in our 30's and Caesar's has done a great job of infusing youth with their clubs with the older generation that has been coming back since the 1970's. It was packed from when we got there on Thursday to when we left on Sunday night.The pool area is very nice and the pools were heated even though it was over 100 degrees outside, which we liked. We were able to stay cool by the pool since half of the pool area spends most of the day in the shade, which has its pluses and minuses. It was impossible for 4 of us to find spots in the sun but we were able to stay cooler in the shade and hand out in the sunny side of a few of the pools. We bought a few rounds of beers at the store right by the entrance of the pool area instead of from the waitresses to save some money and make sure we didn't have to wait too long for the next round of drinks.Overall, I would say that Caesar's is right on par with some of the nicer Vegas hotels we stayed at but still a small step below a 5 star, maybe a 4.5 or a 4.75. We will definitely come back. It's a great place."
109,303,"Sep 14 2009 	Nice hotel excellent location	We stayed at Caesars Palace for five nights in September 2009, the hotel is incredibly centrally located on the Strip and is in an excellent position to walk to most of the main hotels on the Strip. We were allocated a room in the Centurion Tower which is through the casino and appeared to be one of the older towers, however, the room was fine. We had a great view looking straight at Flamingoes over the road and the room was clean and comfortable, but a little dated. One thing we noticed was that the room did not have a fridge/mini bar although this was not a major problem for us. We spent one day by the pool, which was great. There are tons of places to eat, I would definitely recommend the cheesecake factory in the Forum Shops. Overall we enjoyed our stay, a couple of things stopped me rating the hotel higher. The queues at reception are ridiculously long and our room was quite dated. One day we came back a clean room, but they had forgotten to give us any towels so we had to call down for some. They did arrive promptly though, so perhaps I'm being a little picky."
110,303,"Sep 13 2009 	Ceasars Good but Pricey when compared to others on the Strip	We had booked a 5 night stay through Vegas.com about 4 months before and it seemed a good deal with rooms in the Roman Tower. However, after reading some of the reviews of the Roman Tower just before we left we made a mental note to check out upgrades when we arrived and we got a lovely room in the Palace Tower for an extra $35 per night. I did get a feeling though that room rates could have been negotiated when we arrived and next time I would just turn up (unless there's a special event on in Vegas etc). The hotel is fabulous expecially the shops. Dining there can be expensive but we had a lovely meal at the Sea Harbour restaurant with 20% discount, we also had a fab meal at the Japanese restaurant with a buy one meal get one free deal. You do need to have money when here as it is expensive.Having stayed at the Luxor a few years ago for a much lower rate, I personally think Ceasars is over rated. The pool area looks lovely, but the pool was dirty and with building works going on around the pool it was quite noisy. The Strip is growing all the time and perhaps Ceasars has just grown too big to be competive with their pricing!!"
111,303,"Sep 13 2009 	What a rip off!	Everything is extra at this hotel. We were clearly in one of their low-end rooms (upgrades come at a cost, even mid week) -- the room was quite nice, but the bathroom had a handprint on the wall that looked like CSI forensics must have been through the place some time ago. The shower had a dodgy curtain and the only wardrobe space was in the bathroom!$14 per day wifi access in your room for ONE device only...an old television...no coffee maker...and no refrigerator (although some rooms must have a mini one, because down the hall there was a rusty one sitting there for several days). No mini bar snacks or anything. A vending machine down the hall sold pepsi, pepsi, pepsi and water."
112,303,"Sep 12 2009 	Consistently Delivers A Superb Experience	I've come to Las Vegas 2-3 times a year for the last 25 years and have stayed at several hotel-casinos including several of what many consider upscale ones. I've truly been impressed with Caesars Palace over the last 3 years. My Palace Tower rooms have always been fresh, neat, and clean with excellent views of the pool. The recent addition of the new tower, villas, convention center, and the 2nd story pool over the new outdoor BJ pool is an eye-opener. The choices of restaurants and cuisine appeal to all tastes and budgets although the buffet is unbecoming. The Deuce bus stops in front of the hotel and that is great to scoot up and down the Strip. But, it's the service quality of the staff that is really distinctive. Everyone works as a team and does their best to please me. They always give me options if my first request is unfulfilled. I've never experienced that at the Venetian or any MGM Mirage resort. These other resorts seem to only want the 21-30 young &quot;adults&quot; who think everyday is spring-break and haven't advanced past frat, sorority, and dorm life."
113,303,"Sep 12 2009 	Beautiful Place to Stay but the slots are tight!!	My husband and I were there Sept. 5-9, 2009. We have stayed here many times over the last 8 years. The pool area is now complete and is absolutely beautiful, well worth the wait. Plan on spending about $15-$20 for a mixed drink and $9 for a beer at the pool/casino. Our room in the Augustus Tower was very nice. The slots were very tight, just like they were when we went in April, 2009. The $1 Wheel of Fortunue slots at Caesars do occasionally hit the $1,000. We also tried Harrah's and Flamingo and can honestly say we didn't see anyone winning large jackpots. In fact we only saw 2 people in 4 days win hand/cash pays. Also, Slots of Fun has upgraded their slots, this was one of the few places left that actually still used coins - now it's paper just like the rest. It was kind of sad to see all of the old machines gone. The slot tournament at Caesars was very nice (over 1,100 players). Also, Penazzi Oyster Bar at Harrah's has excellent food and the prices are reasonable! Good luck if you go, just plan on not bringing much money home."
114,303,"Sep 11 2009 	Perfection	Me and BFF always wanted to stay at Caesars and are fans of Bellagio. Glad we tried it! Arrived at 8AM on a Sunday morning and they had a Fountain View room available in the Augustus Tower. The room was perfect for 2 women. 2 queen beds, large bath room with jetted tub and the view was wonderful. Plenty of room for both of us to get ready. Beds were very comfortable. Hallways clean and maid service was excellent. Plenty of towels and goodies everyday. The pool was still under a bit of construction, but very nice for traveling without children. Kids would not like this pool. Drinks were expensive but STRONG and worth it. Very tasty Mango Margarita's! QUA spa is the best in LV. The Roman tubs, Arctic Ice room and steam were heaven as was the spa treatment. We did not eat any meals at Caesars so i can not rate that. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
115,303,"Sep 11 2009 	LOVED IT!	We stayed for 3 nights starting from Sunday during Labour Day weekend. We were originally given a Classic Tower Room and we extremely disappointed. We were expecting more from a 4-1/2 star hotel. We checked in right away even though it was only 12:30 which surprised us. But that's because the room was very old and badly in need of renovation, especially the bed. We left our luggage in the room and went to the pool. What a beautiful pool area - probably the best in Las Vegas. We stayed for a couple of hours talking about our room and decided upgrade for an extra $40.00 per night. We got a beautiful Deluxe Forum Tower room - it was like night and day. It was a lovely room - kingsize very comfortable bed, nice, clean linens, t.v. in the mirror, flat screen t.v. in the living room, seating area, drapes opened by remote control and got a great view of the strip. They gave us a $50 food and beverage credit which is gone in a day if you eat or drink anything in the pool area. Quite expensive - a beer is $8.00! We went to the PURE Nightclub the last night - well, if you're not VIP in that place, you are nothing. Caesar's is money-hungry. It's great, but expensive."
116,303,"Sep 11 2009 	Fantastic	My husband and I went to Vegas in October. We stayed at Caesars and it was fantastic. Upon arrival, we asked to be upgraded and the reception clerk could not have been more helpful. We got to our room and it was amazing, best hotel room we have ever stayed in. It made our holiday even more special. The room was huge, it was more like a suite with a bathroom just as big. The hotel is massive, as they all are in Vegas but it was just wonderful. It was our first visit to Vegas and we cant wait to go back. We stayed a week and it just wasn't long enough. All staff at the hotel were so helpful and friendly. We booked to see Cher ain concert but she cancelled on the day, we were refunded the same day so can't fault that. I would definitely stay here again!"
117,303,Sep 10 2009 	great hotel for all !!	We had heard the bad reviews about this hotel but they could not have been further from the truth. We took a chance when checking in and asked for an upgrade and the lady gave us an immediate upgrade to the newest tower (augustus i think) with an amazing view over the bellagio fountains!!The Casino isn't laid out as well as some of the others. The Forum Shops are way overpriced but it's worth just walking down thru them just to see the ceiling alone.We only ate in the hotel once and that was the buffet for $30 each which was good for what we got !Get your breakfast over in Planet Hollywood all you can eat for $15.We will come back again
118,303,"Sep 10 2009 	Fantastic Location Great pool	I booked this hotel about 3 months in advance and got a fantastic deal it was preety much half price through Expedia.com. Ceasers Palace is smack bang right in the middle of The Strip. it is not far from the airport (like most of The Strip Hotels). It is a stunning looking hotel and reception area is easy to find. On checkin we signed up for a casino rewarder card which is free and gives you a $20 dinning voucher so that was good value.The hotels location is so good for it is close to the other hotels that hold attracts eg Bellargio fountain display right next door and the pirate show held at treasure island just down the road.The room was in the roman towers and really large with 2 double beds. The bathrooms and really large with a bath and a shower and plenty of room to put you items. Fresh towels daily and they dont start cleaning until after 10 so good if you have a lie in after a big night.the pool area is great no much shade and they were doing the other pool area up while we were thers so maybe this has changed. Drinks are quite expensive by the pool and inside the casino. The Pure nightclub is pretty cool and free if you are a guest but there was no where to sit if you are not in a VIP area so can get really tiresome if you have to stand all night. Did I mention drinks are expensive.You can get a strip bus to the shopping out lets. I would recommend only going to the Premium outlet for it has the same stores as the basic one and also much better ones, also it is easy to get back to the strip from the premium outlet.The only downfall is that the view was not great and the service in the buffet area not great. But all in all a highly recommended hotel."
119,303,"Sep 9 2009 	Rather Okay	We arrived after midnight and should have been heading for bed. We decided to go down to play slots &quot;Just for a little while&quot;. This was our first night in town this trip and we didn't get to bed until 5:30. Drunk..............And Broke........... I couldn't believe how crappy the payouts were at Caesars. We went fot breakfast across the street at Imperial Palace. Still not a very good buffet. Two bloody Mary's there.....Drunk again............. Back to bed and up at 4:30 to head to Excalibur for the Tournament of kings show(which was okay). We headed downtown that night and had a pretty good time. While visiting the pool at Caesars(which I figured would be one of the more enjoyable things to do there) I was pretty disappointed. I could hear this pounding base music from the bar close by which sort of over-rided the relaxing pool music we were supposed to be hearing. I just couldn't relax and ended up going across the street to get our show tickets for that day at tix for tonight.(Legends in concert 2for1 and George Wallace) Both shows were pretty good. When I got back to the pool my wife wasn't very happy because of the distracting sounds from over yonder. (Base from bar and construction). We headed out for a nice lunch. The room we had reserved was the Forum Tower Deluxe but when she found out we were Diamond Club members she automatically upgraded us to the Augustus Tower which is very close to the Diamond Lounge. I was really expecting something special because I had heard that the Forum tower rooms were quite good and the Augustus tower is a lot more expensive. My wife was very happy with the room and I have to admit I was pleased as well. I remember the shower havig multiple shower heads and there was a jucuzzi tub as well. Lots of stone and marble. Great TV. We could see the Bellagio Fountains (or at least the top of them) as our window was facing south. I just enjoyed looking outside to sort of get a feel for what was going on out there. We could see the busy Flamingo/Las Vegas Strip corner and all the people walking around. I don't want to stay at this place again as I prefer to come down the elevator and be able to walk right into a casino or go right out to the street without having a stroke. Next time it's back to the Flamingo for a little less luxury and a lot less wandering through seemingly endless walkways, entrances and rooms. Also for a tip. I'm pretty careful not to lose money on the slots, but at Caesars and Paris its almost impossible not to. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants. The Diamond club in Atlantic City has a full meal to offer and luxurious surroundings. The Diamond clubs at Vegas have chicken wings and chips and dip. Overall I still love Vegas and can't wait to go back next March!!"
120,303,"Sep 8 2009 	Enjoyed my stay at Caesars	Room - Augustus Tower 2 Queen bed corner room 3 nightsHaving been to Las Vegas four times it was about time I stayed at Caesars Palace. I Have stayed at all the major 5* hotels on the strip like Venetian, Wynn, MGM, ect. I booked the room directly from the hotels website with a special room rate code I found on the internet. upon checkin, which was about 11pm there was a short line. The clerk at the desk gave us a corner room which is located at the end of every corridor, the corner rooms are much bigger then a normal room and i would defiantly recommend asking for this room when you checkin. The rooms are nice and big with a huge bath tub. I would say rooms are just nice and they dont have the WOW factor like the rooms at the Wynn. I was happy with the rate I paid for the room, but had I paid normal Caesars rates i would of been a bit disappointed. The Casino is big and a bit hard to navigate at first as you find your self going round in circles. The slots in Caesars are probably the tightest i have played and youll find your $20 gone in about 2-3 mins.As for the food, make sure you try the serendipity3 restaurant which is located just outside Caesars, the food is amazing and the deserts are even better. make sure you ask to sit outside and enjoy your food while sitting in the middle of the vegas strip. As for the restaurants in the hotel, we tried the Augustus cafe for breakfast and was not very impressed. The pool area is also just OK and also a bit outdated, they are currently in the process of building a new pool which should be opening soon, even though their is construction pool side, you wont notice it. Make sure you take ID with you to the pool as you cant order anything on the room without it.All in all, I enjoyed my stay at Caesars and would recommend staying here if you get a good room rate. Also remember that this hotel is right in the centre of the strip which makes the location ideal."
121,303,"Sep 8 2009 	Amazing Time In Vegas	7 students. 4 guys and 3 girls... stayed at Caesars Palace from a Sunday to a Thursday because of the cheap rates.Most amazing trip of our lives.I'm not someone for the bar scene and the clubs were soooo much fun!! Even though we went on weekday nights the bars were still packed!Caesars was very accomidating... they allowed us to switch rooms because we wanted the two rooms next to eachother. It is a pain waiting in line to check in and out... but oh well.The Pools are beautiful.... I really cannot describe them. But we spent everyday by them.Pure NightClub on Wednesday Night was wild and amazing. Money rained from the ceiling all night and partying on the roof was AMAZING!!!We also checked on Jet at the Mirage which was a great club.... 3 rooms and the music was great. Everything from 80s, to hip hop to Michael Jackson of course.LAX wasn't that good because alot of it is roped off so people just keep walking and no one really dances... I got burned by a few cigarettes that night :SDenny's is great for breakfast (middle of the strip).And there is a small casino next to Denny's and it has $1 beers and $1 Magaritas. ... Imports are $1.50. We pregamed here every night!!! Also my friend won $500 here and another won $250. There is a ticket place IN VEGAS on the strip that gives you 50% off tickets... so DO NOT buy your tickets in advance. Show tickets are always available.Spend the extra $7 to get the VIP up to the Eiffel tower... otherwise you will be waiting like 2 hours.... as opposed to 10 minutes."
122,303,"Sep 6 2009 	Best hote of our trip	Have read a few of the reviews and am surprised at the negative comments... we were obviously very lucky as our room was fab and just what we wanted for a one-night stay. We had booked a de-luxe room for 3 people (mum, dad and teenage son) and our confirmation gave us a location in the Forum Tower. On arrival (self-parked, so we were miles from the reception area and ended up going in via the staff entrance!) we had to go through miles of slot machines (we understand the concept!) until we got to the reception area. Check in was relatively quick, despite queues, and we had a friendly check-in clerk who upgraded us to Augustus Tower. Not sure why and we did'nt question it... but presumably a good move as we had a lovely, very clean, very comfortable room with lots of luxury extras. Views over the Strip, two comfortable beds with great linen, sofa and chairs, two windows, massive TV, mini-bar (which we didn't use - and there were no prices), fab bathroom with double shower and spa bath, separate loo, great toileteries. We did Las Vegas for our son - and spent our evening wandering the hotel and streets for the atmosphere. Ceasars made it acceptable for us &quot;oldies&quot; - however the pool was full of mostly &quot;stag&quot; and &quot;hen&quot; parties (lots of cocktails and beer on the go and lots of heavy flirting). We enjoyed the facilities, but thought the pool was a bit mucky because of plastic cups, fag ends etc especially after the odd gust of wind. The best margarhitas of the trip though!If you're going to book, then make sure you spend a little extra... however, think this is a general problem in Las Vegas as we went to visit Circus Circus (again for our son) and found that incredibly &quot;tired&quot;.However we did have the most amazing &quot;all you can eat&quot; buffets in one of the restaurants - think it was Cafe Lago - which satisfied our requirements on the night. Definitely not a Michelin starred experience, but a great way to get good value and good food, with pretty good service too. Alcoholic drinks were expensive but the sodas were OK."
123,303,"Sep 6 2009 	A great place to stay	This was my first time staying at Caesars Palace.I have usually stayed at other hotels.I have to say beginning with the check in the service was quick and helpfull.I had a free upgrade with the package i booked with Westjet vacations.The room i got was in the palace tower and a deluxe room.The room had a pool view.It was very clean.I was very happy with the room.Maid service was very good.The only downfall was the reception on tv wasn't great on all channels but who goes to Vegas to watch tv?The room had lots of room.The room had a double jacuzzi tub,double sinks,seperate shower.Is any place perfect of course not but i have to say i had no problems staying there friendly and helpful staff,clean rooms at a reasonable price."
124,303,Sep 6 2009 	Caesar's is there to make you stay fantastic!	Nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Best service I have ever received. Received a GREAT rate.
125,303,"Sep 5 2009 	Loved Caesars!	This was our fourth visit to Vegas, previously having stayed at Luxor, TI and The Mirage. We don't gamble much, just a few $ on the slotties, so we never get comps or anything, so I am commenting on the hotel as a tourist rather than on the casino etc.We stayed for 4 nights, having got the 4th night free through our booking with the UK travel company. The really pleasant guy on the check-in said he would upgrade us to the Palace tower, and our room was lovely. On the 15th floor, with a partial Strip view, very spacious, and a huge bathroom with a double Jacuzzi. It was bright and spotlessly clean. As usual, the mini-bar was extortionately priced, but this is the same the world over, and there was a large ice-bucket and plentiful ice available to chill your own wine that you've bought from the store for a few dollars. Coffee making facilities would have been nice, but that's my only very small niggle about the room.The lifts (elevators) were almost instantaneous despite being on floor 15, and all of the public areas were clean and well maintained. The concierge was very helpful when we wanted to book a show but there was a long queue as there was only one lady on the desk.We didn't eat in the hotel apart from by the pool one day, and although expensive, the portions were huge and very tasty; I had a mozzarella salad which was enormous and covered both my lunch and, as we English say, high tea ;-). Again, the drinks around the pool are way over-priced with two small tins of Corona beer coming in at around $15 plus tip!My only complaint about Caesars is the pool area. The pools themselves are lovely but if you don't get there early in the morning, 9.00am latest, you will struggle to get a sunbed. There is work going on at the moment which probably adds to the problem. Because of the high rise buildings around the pool, some beds are in the shade most of the day whilst others are in the sun with no shade at all; there were no parasols available or any tree cover, unless you paid the ridiculous sum of $250+ per day for a gazebo with sunbeds inside. Don't be fooled by the poster in the pool lobby which says these start from $25 per half-day. That probably means between the hours of 01.00am and 07.00am in January...Slight niggles aside, we loved Caesars. It is absolutely centre-strip which makes a real difference as you can do a hell of a lot of walking! And go to Jimmy Buffett's MargaritaVille directly across the road, not only for great Margaritas (of course) but they do a fabulous breakfast too!"
126,303,"Sep 4 2009 	Wonderful Room	Room - Augustus Tower Deluxe Room - stayed 2 nightsCheck in clerk was very nice and when we asked for 2 queen beds instead of 1 king, immediately changed our room  no problems at all. Warned us to be careful about using the mini-bar. Check out was very easy over the phone. Room was very beautiful and impressive. Bathroom was huge, 2 sinks set in a beautiful bureau. Small flat screen television in bathroom, along with a separate toilet room (with phone), Jacuzzi and separate glassed-in shower. Flat screen television in room, huge floor-to-ceiling windows with a view of almost the entire Bellagio fountains! Round table with 3 upholstered chairs, plus a coffee table, couch, and another armchair. Robes and safe in the closet. Beds were very comfortable."
127,303,"Sep 4 2009 	augustus tower worth the stay	clean,comfortable beds, great space,great location at front of hotel,they should police smokers a little more (found a girl smoking at the elevator on my floor), towels need a little more fluff,overall good experience"
128,303,"Sep 2 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	We have just returned from a week's stay at Caesars Palace and having read some of the reviews we were expecting the worst.We booked a flight and a room at Caesars with a Teletext company After a brilliant flight with Thomas Cook Premiun, we arrived at the hotel slightly apprehensive.. but ... There were no long queues to check in, and the receptionist was lovely and allocated us a room in the Palace Tower on the 25th floor. After we had dragged our suitcases for what seemed like miles we eventually arrived at our room. It was FANTASTIC, two bathrooms, spa bath, double shower, living area, enormous bed, views over the pool. The whole Caesars experience was fantastic, designer shops, good restaurants, shows, We are not gamblers so cannot comment on the Casino. Check out was also painless, no long queuesWe couldn't find anything to complain about (and we are complainers if we need to be)."
129,303,"Sep 2 2009 	Caesars scores again.	My wife, son, and I visited Aug 21-24th. Had two rooms in the Palace Tower. Wife, a non-gambler, enjoyed the easy access to the pool and the spa. Rooms were clean and well-maintained. The housekeeping staff was friendly and helpful with our requests for pillows and towels. The only draw back was a request for a frig for my diabetic meds. It was delivered the afternoon of our last day. We enjoyed Payard for their crepes especially the chocolate sauce. Chocolate truffles from the clock were excellent. We had a minor complaint with the Cafe Augustus. We had ordered breakfast...and wound up waiting 1/2 hour. Luckily, we are on vacation and did not complain. The waiter was apologetic and did not charge us for the coffees, which I thought was only right.Been to Caesars 4 times and our only complaints have been minor ones. Would stay their again."
130,303,"Sep 2 2009 	worst won ton soup ""probably in the world""	Sea Harbour restaurant in caesars palace has to be the worst restaurant that i have ever eaten in anywhere in all the cities ,towns , or countries I've eatin in. My son and I had one order of what was supposed to be wor wonton one order of spring rolls that were ok water and tea. no booze . The bill was over $70.00 bucks . The service was very good but ,the nite before we went to china town and had a meal and wor wonton and a couple beers for $40.00 and it was very good . This place is a black eye to Caesars were we were not staying there but did stay in 2008."
131,303,"Sep 1 2009 	Diamond Player is NOTHING if you arent 7Stars at Caesars..poor service	I just returned from a trip to Vegas I average 4 trips a year....I normally stay at Paris/Rio/Ballys where I have never had a problem...I thought I would give Caesars another chance after a bad experience about 3 years ago.....well I made a POOR choice...the only thing I can say was my ROOM was nice....The main problem came when I tried to have a friend wire me some money...on his end Western Union was closed and being Sunday so were the banks...So he found a Moneygram service and sent me extra cash to GAMBLE with..After walking about 2.5 miles to get this I was told the Moneygram service at CVS only dispenses money orders...I thought this wouldnt be a problem to cash at the Casino based on my history with Harrahs....was I WRONG....not only would Caesars NOT CASH it they wouldnt even help me try to solve this problem...I spoke to a Casino Host and she just said &quot;there's nothing we can do...we dont take money orders&quot; WOW....didnt even spend 5 min trying to call anyone to help solve my problem.....so I was in a BAD situation...I went to Paris/Ballys to meet with my Host CHRISTINE MIKHAIL...not only did she spend time helping me she comped a LIMO to take me to cash my money order, along with the LIMO driver DAVE PEGULA....my crisis was solved and I WILL NEVER STAY/PLAY at caesars AGAIN......PARIS/BALLYS this is customer SERVICE.....to a Diamond Player...not 7stars as caesars only cares about.....even at check in/check out if your not 7stars FORGET ABOUT SERVICE.....at CAESARS"
132,303,"Aug 31 2009 	Not as expected...	We booked a package deal with Southwest Airlines and our room was in the Roman Tower. Boy, this was a plant for an upgrade for sure. Had a musty odor, window was directly in front of a concrete wall, lamps very dusty, carpets dirty and the mattress looked like it had a lump in the middle. When we called the front desk, we were quickly upgraded to a much better room in the Augustus Tower. The TV didn't work and after two calls, it was determined an electrician had to fix it, so we asked for another room and were granted one directly below (5 floors) our room, which was much better. Everything worked and the room was clean. The line is long at the front desk since they have check-in/out combined (unless you're a high limit player). I may stay there again if there was an option to pick the &quot;tower&quot; for an upgrade within a package deal... I don't like being given an undesirable room knowing you would have to upgrade. If this is a 4.5 star rated hotel, then all rooms should be as such or better."
133,303,"Aug 30 2009 	Classic room- dont bother	Please let me warn you about the classic rooms. You really need to think wisely before booking this type of room. We booked 4 x classic rooms for my family for 3 nights , and each room was stale,smelly and very old. The bed was very uncomfortable. I have stayed at Harrahs and Flamingo before and they were ok. Really expected a lot more from Caesars. Location is fantastic but I recommend to anyone thinking of staying at Caesars. Either pay a little bit more and go to a deluxe room or prem room. Do not think about a classic room in the roman tower. They are very very old, dark and smelly. Its like the room was closed up for weeks. The cheaper deluxe rooms at the Flamingo or Paris hotel are far better. The pool and shower are the best thing going for this place. Stayed in Venetian through Priceline in March and could have stayed at MGM/NYNY or TI for cheaper this time. Have learnt my lesson.... Even though you dont stay long in your room in Vegas its nice to come back to a nice room. Spoke to the front desk, and they agreed with me that you pay for what you get......"
134,303,"Aug 30 2009 	Many better hotels in Vegas	We have just got back from a three-night stay at Caesar's Palace staying in one of the recently refurbished rooms in the Forum Tower. Having visited Vegas over 10 times we both agreed that this stay was probably the most disappointing visit we have had. Let's start with the room, refurbished and spacious yet the corridors were dirty and the cleaning trolley was permanently parked outside our room - nice! The room itself had the handle hanging off one of the cupboards, the main light in the bathroom was not working, the fan in the toilet was permanently on (not great for sleeping) and the air conditioning started making a very strange noise after being on for a little time and the only way to stop it was to switch it off, so no air con when sleeping.The location of the hotel is fantastic, right in the middle of everything. Restaurants were all very good (especially the Mesa Grill) although all somewhat expensive compared to our previous trips.Regarding the Total Rewards card and the comps, we were both a little surprised at how little we were comped against our room bill. Having stayed at other casinos in the past this was certainly not our experience,All we can conclude is that Caesar's is trading on it's history and is in a position of strength therefore does not need to take much care nor does it need to do much to attract visitors. We will not be returning again to Caesar's - plenty more choice available elsewhere offering much better value."
135,303,"Aug 28 2009 	No Place Better	Completed another trip with a stay at Caesars. Can't say enough about the property. From the desk clerks to just about every employee, nothing but superb service. The Augustus Tower is quiet and roomy, just what you want at the end of the day. The bars are fun with great employees who have been there year after year. The location is the best, especially for first-timers.. You can walk to the 4 corners from the hotel without venturing too far. Bally's and Paris are always fun. Bellagio has a great restaurant in Olives and has Coca-cola products and local newspaper (suits at harrahs ban these on their property). Otherwise, Mesa Grill, Neros Bar, and my favorite Casa Fuente make this the premier Vegas property. The complaints I read about can be easily resolved with the right people at the hotel. I have never had a problem."
136,303,"Aug 27 2009 	First Time In Vegas... Caesars Did NOT Disappoint	My husband and I visited Vegas for the first time August 19-21. My sister and brother-in-law joined us and we all had a great stay at Caesars. Many thanks to the reviews suggesting you inquire about the &quot;complimentary upgrades&quot; upon check-in. We reserved and paid for a Classic room and took our chances that we'd be upgraded. I folded up a $20 bill and held it in from of my id while checking in and asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available. I saw the lady glance at it and she said &quot;Let me check.&quot; She was able to find us a suite in the Palace Tower and told me I really didn't have to tip her when I handed her the $20 (of course I did anyway.) She was very nice and professional about it. My brother-in-law planned on doing the same thing when he checked in, but forgot to use the word &quot;complimentary.&quot; Instead, he was offered an upgrade to a 4000 sq. ft. suite (compared to our 2000 sq. ft. suite) in the new Augustus Tower. I think he paid around $160 total, which included 2 nights. They told him it was normally $200+ per night to upgrade, so it sounds like he got a good deal too. We reserved a smoking room and were very pleased with everything. The room was clean, very nicely decorated (see attached pics, I love blue &amp; brown) and stocked with plenty of towels, etc. I did notice the next morning when I woke up that the room smelled like an ashtray, which was weird because it hadn't before. Then after the maid cleaned that day the smell was gone, so they must have a very powerful deoderizer. We were in the Palace Tower, Room 1742 and had a view of the pools, which open at 8:00. We went out right after 8:00 and had no problems with chairs. We only stayed 1 hour so I don't know exactly when it got crowded, but when I looked down around 3:00 or 4:00 I only saw 1 or 2 open chairs and they were not together. We ate breakfast at the buffet and it was great. Some people say there's not a large selection, but I'm not sure what you could want for breakfast that they didn't have... eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits &amp; gravy, muffins &amp; other pastries, french toast, pancakes, cheese, fruit, etc. It was $18.95 if I remember correctly (definitely under $20) and worth it. We booked through Expedia and received a $50 food &amp; beverage credit that could be used at any Caesars restaurant or bar, so our breakfast was &quot;free.&quot; We tried the buffet at Terrible's for lunch and it was good enough. Pretty decent for what it costs - I think only $7 pp. We ate dinner at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak &amp; Stone Crab in the Forum Shops mall and it was really good. Prices you can expect for a nicer Vegas restauraunt (anywhere from $30-$50 per plate plus extra for sides, salads, everything.) All in all, we had a great time in Vegas. Next time I'll want to stay at least one more night. We arrived late Wednesday and had to leave early Friday so we really only had 1 full day. The staff at Caesars were all very friendly and helpful in our experience. I would definitely stay here again if the price were right, but there are other places on the strip I'd want to try out too (Bellagio for one.) Make sure to catch at least one Bellagio fountain show. I think they run every fifteen minutes at night and they're really neat.P.S. I can't speak much for the gambling at Caesars b/c I only played the slots there, and did no good. We (all of us) had good luck on the Blackjack tables at O'Sheas though."
137,303,"Aug 27 2009 	Another great experience.	This was our second trip to Ceasars Palace. As with the first trip, we were offered an upgrade and the room was great. All of the staff was friendly and willing to help in any way to make our stay pleasant. Even with pool construction, it was a great experience. Cannot wait to go back and see the finished product. Great location and wonderful hotel."
138,303,Aug 26 2009 	Had a great time at the Casars!	Stayed two nights in August. Dif the 20 dollar trick and got a beautiful room in the Augustus tower! Had a lovely time!
139,303,"Aug 26 2009 	Review of the Rain Man suite.	This is strictly a review of the Rain Man Suite at Caesars, where I recently stayed for a bachelor party. This suite was based on the fictional one in the movie &quot;Rain Man&quot;. Per the Las Vegas Sun, the suite in &quot;The Hangover&quot; was also partly based on this room. It's on the 69th floor (top floor) of the Forum Tower. The suite is bi-level, and has up to 4 bedrooms (if you use the connecting neighboring rooms). We used one of the connecting rooms, so we had 3 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms.The living room is huge. It has a circular sofa on both sides, and a 52&quot; HDTV in the middle of the room that revolves 360 degrees. There is a great 2-story view of the Strip. There are speakers built into the ceilings and walls on both floors, and you can attach your IPod and blast your music through-out the entire suite. The TV also has access to both DirecTV and Dish Network, and there's also a Blu-Ray player in the room.There is a fancy remote that controls all the lighting (different moods), and the curtains. The suite also has a dining table and kitchen area. The bedrooms on the top level are huge, and have luxurious bathrooms. There are even TVs built into the bathroom mirrors. Because you need to be able to watch SportsCenter while you are shaving.The Suite is just awesome. We got numerous comments from other riders when we hit the 69 button on the elevator. One girl even jokingly accused me of trying to impress her by hitting that button. A few other people asked us for tours. The list rate on the room is $6,400 a night but you can easily get it for much cheaper if you gamble a lot. This room is ideal for a bachelor party, as you can easily fit up to 20 people in the Suite."
140,303,"Aug 25 2009 	Wonderful!	If you like hanging by the pool, shopping at pricey shops, and great enterainment. Caesars is for you. The food is good, but expensive...$3.50 for a black tea. $15 for breakfast, even at their food court. I would stay there again but look else where to find food. SPA was amazing!!!!!!"
141,303,"Aug 20 2009 	Great stay at Caesars!	I stayed at CP with 3 of my girl friends, aged 24-25 from July 2  July 5, 2009. We booked w/ Sunwing Vacations and paid $650 CAD each.We booked the Classic Room (which is the older tower, and had heard pretty terrible reviews of it, mainly that it was rundown and such) so we were pretty worried. We arrived at the hotel at 10am and left our bags w/ the bell desk. We returned at 1pm to check-in and were offered a free upgrade by the front desk. We got upgraded to a Palace Tower room  which is the tower closest to the pool entrance. We heard from people we met that they were not offered a free upgrade, in some cases even after offering a tip to the front desk. Seems to be hit or miss w/ the front desk, or perhaps it depends on your attitude when you get up there! The room was spacious, beds comfy, flat screen tv. Jacuzzi tub in the bathroom, double sinks, separate shower. There was a separate vanity area outside the bathroom as well. Bathrobes are provided in the closet, and extra towels and bathrobes were brought up promptly both times that we called for them during our stay. Maid service was so-so. It appeared that our bathroom floor was not mopped daily. We were not picky about this. The beds were made up nicely and the towels refreshed daily. The complex itself is pretty massive. The walk from the room to the strip was about 10 minutes. In terms of restaurants, we ate at Noodle 9  it was fairly priced but the food not the greatest. I wouldnt recommend it. There is a food court between the casino and the Forum Shops  you could get good food for reasonable prices, and not have to go to a sit down restaurant. Highly recommend the burger place as the food is fresh and delicious!The pool at CP is very nice  you need to get out there before 11am in order to get lounge chairs for your group. And even so, this took some effort in moving lounge chairs around so that we could all sit together. By afternoon guests spread out on the deck wherever they can find space! The pool is great b/c it gets sun ALL day, vs other hotels where the sun might be blocked by the hotel during certain times.I probably wouldnt stay here again, only because there are so many other great hotels along the strip that you could probably get for a similar price  its always good to try something new!"
142,303,"Aug 20 2009 	Caesars Nice 	As with all stays there are Pros and Cons! Be prepared for LONG, LONG check-in lines. There is not enough staff nor self check-in options so you stand in a Disney type loop line for 20-30 mins just to check in.Our last trip was a year ago plus a few months to see Elton John. This time we came to see Bette. We stayed in the Augustus Tower last time and this time they wanted to upgrade us to a one bedroom suite in the Forum Tower. The Forum Tower has been complete redone and is very nice. However, if you are going to use the spa you have to walk through the casino for quite some time to reach it. It is in the Augustus Tower. The last thing you want after a great massage is a 20 min walk through a smokey casino.So book accordingly. Our room had last been inhabited by a bachlorette party and their balloons were still up in the room We found more behind the couch. Strange.Otherwise the room was large, clean and well kept during our stay.Caesars is convenient to the Flamingo, Harrahs, Imperial across the street as well as Ballys, Mirage, Treasure Island and the Bellagio. Nice little walkways and escalators whisk you to these other hotels. We like to eat and gamble at different places so we liked being able to go in a different direction and find new casinos. A number of these casinos are part of the Harrah's network so if you are a Total Rewards customer you get points at all of them.Let talk food: breakfast buffet was cold. Servers were very nice tho. The slice next door is expensive but great for a food court. We had hamburgers one day and pizza another and both were good. The Java Cafe is good for a quick breakfast, but again pricey. Better to go out to Serendipity which had several specials running while we were there including buy one margarita get the second one free. Serendipity is right out the front on the second level outside.The show was great Bette Midler stuff but I was disappointed in the audience. I had seen Bette 33 years ago at Caesars and that audience rocked. We were on the front row and we had four people next to us in shorts who kinda scowled during the whole show. Bette's busting her butt up there. Anyway, she was great and we went backstage afterward which was great fun. Rita Rudner was backstage waiting on Bette. I didn't recognize her as I am not a big comic fan, but my friend did. The gambling is good. Very professional dealers or you can go mechanical! There were booths where you could play 21 with an automated/televised dealer. That was fun. And there is a Rapid Roulette which gets rid of all the shoving at the tables. You have your own roulette table TV screen and about 40 seconds to place a min bet. That was fun too.The slots were tight BUT find the old machines and these pay out better. EVERYONE was playing penny slots. I don't get that. The casino was very very smokey and cocktail waitresses were overworked. They need to put on about 3 more in the evenings.The internet was expensive: $14.99 per day. With as much money as they are raking in downstairs you would think it would be free.Even though this trip was great, I would probably stay somewhere else next time. I am intrigued by the whole Fremont St. experience and the efforts hotels like the Golden Nugget are making to attract customers. So, might try that next time.If you want a great old time Vegas hotel with great amenities, this is the place."
143,303,Aug 19 2009 	WOW......amazing!	We have just got back from 4 nights at Caesars......and I can honestly say that I have not got one bad thing to say about the whole trip! We were upgraded to the palace tower ( did the $20 tip...thanks to all you wonderful trip advisors for telling us!) and had the most amazing room....HUGE and what a bed! and as for the bathroom.....don't get me started on the twin showers and the jet bath...and the 2 toilets!!! WOW!!The view was of the stunning pool area (room 728) and even though we didn't have time to use the pool it looked lovely. Yes they are in the middle of major building works but it didn't bother us (and they work long hours!) Hotel is HUGE but quite easy to work your way around. Casino was good....some lovely staff who were very helpful to us. Won some and also lost some but all in all great fun!Very good location right in the middle of the strip. Would go again tomorrow if I could!!!! Loved it all!!!
144,303,"Aug 19 2009 	FABULOUS MARVELOUS AND OUTSTANDING	My husband was there on buisness and I was there to tag along, we stayed in the Augustus Tower and I can not come up with the words to describe the room, the service and Omg the view from our room was breath taking, but I can finally say after many years of vacationing I had the best time of my life there. I have been to vegas many times before but never stayed at Caesars. I will never stay anywhere again but there. Food was expensive but if you gamble enough its all free. LOL"
145,303,"Aug 17 2009 	Caesars was a great value!	We were unhappy with the view from our room and were upgraded within minutes of complaining. Service from the front desk was prompt. The hotel and casino were clean and in good repair. The catered food and service at all events/meetings/receptions was excellent. Dancing at 'Pure' was awesome! My only complaint would be that the service staff in the casino is obviously older. The 45 yr old waitresses should be wearing uniforms more appropriate for their aging figures! They could also be quicker and friendlier. Other than that, I was very happy with the location, shopping, gambling, food, drink and service that was provided. I was also pleased that the hotel seems to cater to adults. I found the presence of children at other hotels (pools/lobby/shopping) to be a nuisance."
146,303,"Aug 16 2009 	Not what it used to be - many better choices for the non-Harrahs junkie	I stayed 3 nights at Caesars at the conclusion of a 9-night business/pleasure trip to Vegas in June. The good: Beautiful, large room in the Augustus towerLovely spa and decent gymNext to overpriced forum shops (but a pretty mall)Diamond lounge access for semi-big-shot gamblers like I used to beConvenient locationHyakumi all-you-can-eat superb sushi/sashimiThe bad:Long lines unless you are a preferred gamblerRaos restaurant is average and overpricedLong taxi and valet lines (again, short if you have diamond status)Bad odds on the video poker, slot machines, and only average BJ unless you play high limit.If you are given a free room, or somehow can get a good deal and stay in the lovely Augustus tower, this place MAY be worth a visit although there are better choices. As part of the Harrahs chain lots of folks like to come here and keep their loyalty. But gambling odds are better elsewhere (try the Palms or the Wynn).I had dinner one night at Raos. Kind of like Buca di Beppo (a chain) without the super-oversized portions and way overpriced. Service was average. One great thing  all-you-can eat top shelf sushi at lunchtime for $28 or $38 at HyakumiHarrahs clearly stacks the deck in favor of its frequent gamblers making short lines and free amenities available to them alone. But you have to gamble so much to get this status it will cost you thousands for these benefits.Spa charges $45 for the day (but only $25 for the diamond-card gamblers). All the luxury amenities but the layour somehow just didnt feel right easy to get lost compared to other upscale spas I have been to.I had spent 2 nights at the Wynn/Encore (my favorite) with a friend, and then 5 nights at the Palazzo/Venetian for a conference (huge rooms and nice sportsbar) and I would recommend either over Caesars UNLESS you have the diamond card given to Harrahs big gamblers.Caesars used to be the best place in Vegas. Now as an independent tourist Id choose Wynn/Encore, Palms, or Palazzo/Venetian  none of which part of the big chains. Or Id go offstrip to the Marriott, RedRock or M resort. The Harrahs properties are for the birds."
147,303,"Aug 15 2009 	Overated look for better values in Vegas	First time in Vegas and I will not be going back to Caesars. First of all, the check-in process was horrendously slow--it made the Post Office look like first class service. For such a big hotel, they need more than 3-4 people working the front desk.We booked the &quot;newly renovated&quot; Forum Tower, but when we checked in they gave us a room in the Palace Tower which was supposed to be an &quot;upgrade.&quot; I didn't get to see the room in the Forum Tower, but I have a hard time believing that the Palace Tower was an upgrade--nothing special other than a jetted bathtub.The hallway on the ground floor from the casino to the Palace elevators had a very unpleasant odor. Caesars was a disappointment compared to what I had heard, Caesars was a disappointment and I will probably be staying somewhere else next time I go to Vegas.When I got to Vegas I spent some time going around to other hotels that were about the same price as what I had paid for Caesars--I kinda feel like I got cheated since there are better values for the same amount in Vegas."
148,303,"Aug 13 2009 	Excellent Hotel service and location	Caesars Palace - possibly the best hotel in Vegas.My partner and I have just come back from a week in Vegas. We opted for Caesars Palace based on price and location - nothing more. What we got was probably the best hotel on the strip, in one of the best locations with great service.We secured a free upgrade to the Palace Tower with views over the pool. Not all rooms in the tower had such good views, and some rooms in the Roman Towers weren't quite as nice as ours. The pool was stunning and the constant drinks service meant we could enjoy the 100' heat until lunch. Other hotels such as the Venetian (Phantom / Blue Man) were within walking distance -while places like New York and the Stratosphere were a $15-$20 taxi away.Caesars is huge - it includes the Forum shops - with countless restaurants and fancy shops. The casino is big enough and the machines payed out nicely. Highly recommended."
149,303,"Aug 13 2009 	Isn't Caesars Supposed to be the Creme de la Creme?	This was the first time we had ever stayed at Caesars Palace and were truly excited to be staying at one of Las Vegas' most luxurious resorts. We totally set ourselves up for disappointment. First off, there was a hole in the wall. Like some drunken fool had punched it or kicked it. Second, the unit that holds the iron in the wall, almost fell out. Third, every time there was too much white on the TV, the TV would make this buzzing sound and then shut itself off. Fourth, our heater didn't work. I know a heater in the middle of summer? I turn the heater off in the morning during my shower. I like to step out into a warm room. Well after taking our complaint downstairs, we were graciously upgraded to a nicer room. All was well with the new room (there was even a hot tub in it), except for the fact that they didn't even come clean our room! When I got back to my room later that evening (much later that evening) I had to call and ask for fresh towels. I was completely disappointed with Caesars Palace. It's supposed to be the creme de la creme in Vegas and it totally fell short. We will definitely not be staying there again."
150,303,"Aug 13 2009 	Average not ""super fancy"" etc. as told	Im a little bit confused, how people rate this hotel as &quot;super&quot; or &quot;great&quot;, or other synonyms describing how wondeful this hotel is. Maybe this is because some of the review makers have been only in few hotels and has not been travelling too much - or maybe the hotel rooms are all very different from each other, these are the only reasons I can think of.For my opinion, this hotel is a little worn out, and has certainly seen its best days. The public areas, as the lobby and the casino, have had their shining star times long ago. The carpets look old, and the service in front desk is poor.When we arrived the hotel (late at night) with our friends, we were asking to be located to the same floor (we both couples had forum tower de luxe rooms), but this could not be arrenged. Ok, I understand that in a big hotel full of guests this can be hard. But the thing really surprised me was that the clerk at the front desk gave us our keys and guided us to our rooms through the longest way - through the whole casino. He propably thought that we would be more anxious to come back down stairs to play in the casino, than if he would guided us to go via the shortest way to our rooms. I just found this irritating.By the way, no chance having the bell boy taking your luggage to your room- you have to do it your self...at least if you dont have to change the rooms you were just given...then you can get the bell boy carry your suitcases, at least this was our experience.When we got to our room, I first discovered dirty towels on the floor. As I walked through the room, there were two dirty wine glasses and an empty bottle of wine, and other trash lying on floor, on the bed and on the table. Also the bed was obviously used. Disgusting.I called the front desk immediately to have an other room. And I had to call there 4 times before anything happened. We were waiting with our lugagge in the dirty room for 35 minutes before somebody came. With a long way back to the reception and with 3 big suitcases in the middle of the night, that was really the only option - to wait. After several hours travelling in the middle of the night, it didnt feel nice at all. Well, the bell boy finally came, with new keys to our new room - in to a new floor again. He was terribly sorry, and really nice. He was shocked how we were given this dirty room, and said that this wasnt the only time this sort of thing had happened. When we got to the new room, he checked it first, and let us in after looking that everything was OK in the room. He was really nice, and the only person that apologised for the inconvenience.The next day I went to the front desk to say that I found last night waiting and poor service from the front desk terrible, and were given free of charge for 30 dollars of the drinks from the minibar. OK, thats fair enough, I thought.Well, that would been just too easy - as we cheked out later on, again an other clerk at the reception accused us to have been taken some nuts from the minibar, which I told was impossible, as myself and my spouse are terribly allergic to nuts! And yes, we had noticed that when you move or touch the minibar goods, they go wright away to your check, so we didnt even touch anything else than the drinks that we were having (and the nuts were in a different place, not even in the fridge!)- free of charge up to the 30 dollars given. Well, finally they believed us, and said its OK. For me, this was just another experience of the poor service in this hotel.Our friends room was otherwise OK, except the smelling of cigarettes &amp; tobaccos in their room.They have Forum Shops mall area in the hotel, which was nice and convenient. Also a lot of restaurants to choose from. Casino was average. The hotel is very good situated.We went elsewhere for breakfast, as having heard some bad reviews of the hotels own breakfast buffet, so we didnt try that at all - so cant comment on that one.Las Vegas was nice, and we might go back some day, but definitely to an other hotel. This is not a 5 star hotel. I would give it 3 stars, average. Some improvement to the service and the public areas, and some promptness to service, and this hotel could be much better."
151,303,"Aug 12 2009	Did not like the big bait and switch!	I made my reservation through Expedia and requested a room in the Palace Tower with 2 beds because I was meeting friends and was going to be sharing the room with a friend, not family. When my friend and I arrived at the hotel around 7:30pm and tried to check-in, we were told that we would be given a room with a king bed and a roll away. I said that my reservation was supposed to be for 2 queen beds, but since we were checking in at 7:30pm we were told that the king and roll away qualified as 2 beds! I slept in the roll away and gave my friend the king. We were able to move to a new room the next day that had 2 queens but what a hassle. My advice would be not to stay at Caesar's if you will arrive late and are looking for 2 queen beds. I did not feel that 7:30pm was that late but apparently it was for this hotel. One friend wanted to use the fitness center but was told that there was a $25 fee per day to use it!Also our room had a in room safe that did not work and the handle of the shower door was broken. With all these problems I do not believe that paying over $250 a night was justified."
152,303,"Aug 12 2009 	Amazing!!!	Caesars Palace was the most fabulous Hotel i've ever had the pleasure of staying in! It was my first time in Vegas and it definately won't be the last! Cannot fault a single thing about the hotel, staff, facilites or anything! Rooms were huge, very clean and had a maid service daily. I will be returning to Caesars! I love it!!! All i would say is that if your not going to have anything out of the mini bar, don't even touch or lift anything off the counter as it'll get charged to your card. We were told this on check in too."
153,303,"Aug 12 2009 	This is the Room they don't show.	Went with Caesars based on the generic photo of the rooms they offer on various websites. These rooms are available but at a $30 per night premium. The basic room is pretty basic with a refreshening badly needed. Our room was located way up on the third floor with a beautiful view of the casino air conditioning unit. The room is well used but clean and the housekeeping was good each day. The bathroom is large but the king rooms have no doors. If you need a door on the bath, get the double room. Bedside lamp and floor lamps had short circuits and came on and off at will (our own private light show!). It was more funny than irritating but not really expected of a 4 star hotel. TV is old style with &quot;Closed Captioning&quot; that can't be turned off, irritating. At check-in we were presented a coupon book full of coupons that had expired the previous month. We were told by by the clerk (Joannie) that sometimes expired coupons would be honored so just ask......hmmmmm. None of the coupons were for Caesars but for other hotels. Food was very expensive and of not the highest quality. The Bellagio hotel across the street from Caesars had nicer food at lower prices. Caesars breakfast buffet was $18, go across the street to Bellagio and found a better buffet for $14. The same can be said for the Paris buffet on the opposite corner.Forum shops were wonderful and vast and make staying at Caesars a must for shoppers."
154,303,Aug 12 2009 	service disgracefull	The staff at the front desk were extremely rude &amp; didnt care about helping me despite the fact that i was staying there for a week much longer than the average person &amp; that i was an overseas visitor who comes to Vegas every few months for a couple of weeks I now tell all my friends to avoid Ceasars
155,303,"Aug 11 2009 	Awesome experience!	My husband and I travel to Las Vegas 2-3 times a year and this is the first time we chose to stay at Caesar's Palace. Caesar's is a 5-star hotel/casino which has been around longer than others but has never lost it's class. We stayed in the Forum Tower and the location was perfect. We were close to the casino action, forum shops and restaurants. Our room overlooked the strip but was very quiet and secluded. The decor was contemporary and the room was spotless. Housekeeping never failed to clean our room promptly and always left extra amenities, towels, etc. The casino has a good layout and plenty of slots and table games. The cocktail waitresses are excellent when you're at the table games but can be spotty when you're at the slots. The mimosas and mojitas are excellent! The table games have higher limits during the weekends but we wandered directly across the street to O'Sheas where they have low table limits and they honor the &quot;Total Rewards&quot; players cards. The restaurants can be a bit pricey but the food is A-plus with large portions. Overall we had a great experience and will definately stay at Caesar's Palace in the future."
156,303,"Aug 11 2009 	Venus Pool Party - Too Good!	Went to the Venus Pool Party at Caesars Palace on Sunday... was so great. It was off to the side of the regular pool, no kids of course, and full of beautiful people. They only let enough people in to fill the lounge chairs and VIP beds/cabanas...drinks flowing, tonnes of waitresses (all good looking btw). There was a good DJ playing top 40 hip hop and some pop. They have bottle service at the beds. This was one of the best Sunday parties I've ever been too... can't wait to go back!!"
157,303,"Aug 10 2009 	Will Return!	My husband and I just returned from a long weekend at Caesar's Palace, we enjoyed everything, no waiting to check in, Joanie checked us in and could not have been more helpful. Room was in the Augustus Tower and no complaints, room was large and clean (could use a coffee pot) and looked just like the pictures I had seen on internet. Restaurants are pricey, but had to remind hubby that we don't do this very often, so enjoy it! Will definately be back."
158,303,"Aug 9 2009 	Had a wonderful time	This hotel is alway growing. We love how the timeless Ceasars brings us back year after year. We stayed in the Augusts Tower room 3068 great view of the Bellagio water show and Paris. The large Jacuzzi was relaxing, i went to Bath and Bodyworks in the Forum shops got some bubble bath and candle. Next moring My husband was up early and took a jaccuzi bath, he was in a great mood all day. Breakfast at Paris Yuk food was cold. Breakfast at the Bellagio wonderful. Breakfast here at Ceasars was wonderful. Do Not I repeat Do not miss Jersey Boys, It was fantastic. The only complaint I have with ceasars... construction still going on and if you are at the pool closest to the work cover your eyes, plaster and foam will get in your eyes. Once they finish it will be spectacular"
159,303,"Aug 8 2009	Wife Loved It; I Was Overwhelmed; Look Out for the Rooms with NO Bathroom Doors!	I've stayed at a lot of Las Vegas hotels in recent years, making it a point to always break up a stay in Sin City with multiple nights at different hotels.Caesar's is an expensive, big, glitzy Vegas hotel. If you want to be in the middle of the Strip, this is your hotel. If you're coming to Vegas for a convention, Cher or a specific event at Caesar's then by all means stay here. Pool is definitely a scene filled with plenty of young hotties, male and female.The architecture is as Vegas as it gets. People everywhere are shooting pictures. The shops are legendary, the restaurants are top notch and priced accordingly.Even if you don't stay at this hotel, you'll have to vist the shops and casino during your visit to Vegas. It's definitely a desination.We had a weird thing happen. We were initially assigned to a bedroom in the Roman tower that had NO bathroom door. Not because it was taken off the hinges, but because that was the way it was designed. Now I suppose if you're getting a king room you're probably going to be pretty intimate with your bedmate. But call me quaint. I like MY privacy in the bathroom and I know my wife well enough to know that she likes HER privacy in the bathroom too. We asked to be moved to a different room and they accomodated us to a room on the same floor with a bathroom door. Might be worth asking before you check in if this is important to you or if you're staying with someone you're not that close too.We paid about $130 a night, a rate that included a $50 dining credit in the hotel restaurants.I'm not going to choose to stay here again based on the sheer size of the place. Way, way too overwhelming for me. But again, I had absolutely no complaints other than tight slots and I stress my wife really liked the place.One big tip. You can access the parking garage from Frank Sinatra Way which runs parallel to the Las Vegas Strip. It's a huge timesaver coming in or out of the hotel.Enjoy your stay... and just ask about the bathroom door thing!"
160,303,"Aug 7 2009 	loved it	We moved to caesars after a couple of awful nights at Excalibur. The check in clerk upgraded us to a mini suite in the Augustus tower when he learned of our bad experience down the street. Our room was fantastic, it even overlooked the Bellagio fountains. We coudn't have asked for more. Ok there was some construction going on around the pool area, but the disruption was minimal. We loved the forum shops and the restaurants. We would definately stay at caesars again when in Vegas."
161,303,"Aug 5 2009 	AWESOME EXPERIENCE	My spouse and I stayed at Caesar's Palace in July and had a fantastic experience from start to finish. We recieved a complimentary upgrade to the Augustus Tower. The room was immaculate and had an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains and the strip towards Paris. The room came complete with a Jacuzzi tub, minibar and bathrobes. The service we recieved from every staff member at Caesars should be applauded from the front desk clerk (Karla) to the maid to the restauants to the dealers, we had no complaints. We ate at Mesa Grill(great job Brian), Augustus Cafe and Joe's in the Forum Shops. Meals were excellent as was the service in all cases. We typically stay at the Venetian but would have to say that Caesar's is our new home in Vegas."
162,303,"Aug 4 2009 	Avoid Roman Tower	If you like me think Vegas is about enjoying a bit of luxury then avoid the Caesar's Roman Tower. I was totally underwhelmed. You get a better room at the average Hilton by the interstate! The hallways in the tower smelled. The bed wasn't the fancy pillowtop cushy mattress I usually find in a nice hotel, nor were the linens any nicer than what I have at home. The bathroom wasn't terribly nice. No fridge, coffeemaker or microwave. Put it like this: this room didn't make we want to hang out in it, which is my test of how nice a room is. As for the Caesar's Pool: I believe half of it is closed for construction because it seemed smaller than what I saw in pictures. They also blast music and you can hear some of the club music from the Venus pool so if you want a place to relax, forget it. Maybe they have the volume turned up to drown out the construction and the interstate that runs right behind the pool. Anyway, I went out there looking to relax and left after about an hour. If your room faces the pool (like mine at the 13th floor) you can hear the dim &quot;thump, thump&quot; from the pool music all day!Casino: I'm not a gambler but it was kinda smoky (I'm sure there's places worse and better on that mark) and it annoyed me that the layout of the ground floor had me dodging friggin slots anywhere I had to go. Bellagio and Wynn are nicely laid out where you don't have to walk through slots and tables if you don't want to. There also seemed to be a lot of kids in the place, which seems absurd to me. The Las Vegas strip is not for kids!"
163,303,"Aug 4 2009 	As good as they say	Great Hotel, specially the location. so big, you can even get lost. Good casino, Room very clean and awesome view (if you stay in the Augustus Tower). Pool is good but not enough chairs."
164,303,"Aug 2 2009 	Classic Las Vegas	ROOM 1454: Jacuzzi in bedroom. Mirrored ceiling over king-size bed! Transparent doors to washroom and separate toilet and shower. No fridge or coffee/tea facilities. No access to balcony. Toiletries aplenty. HOTEL: Pool with fountains (cold) and lots of sunbeds (no shade) and free towels. Pool at top (warm) with option for luxury double sunbeds. Buffet breakfast available before 11am with various choices (no soya milk). AREA: Excellent central location within the Strip. Next to Bellagio which have superb fountain displays. Venetian Hotel is worth visiting, as well as the Luxor and the top of the Eiffel Tower have excellent views. MGM have lions behind glass which have luxurious surroundings. David Copperfield is an awesome entertainment. Mirage offers a Cirque de Soleil show 'O' which is breathtaking. TOURS: Fremont Street is great, busy night life with vibrant ceiling light shows. Helicopter trip to the Grand Canyon is a memorable trip where Sundance Tours lands in a beautiful spot to take photographs and have a champagne picnic lunch and 'Fred' the pilot gives great commentary and music. A HOTEL YOU MUST EXPERIENCE."
165,303,"Jul 31 2009 	Wonderful hotel met all out expectations!!	Fabulous hotel, superb rooms (we had the Augustus tower) great service, lovely pool.We also saw some great shows and met some lovely people too.Vegas is a crazy place to visit and you may need a holiday to recover but you have to go at some point in your life as its totally unique."
166,303,"Jul 30 2009 	Very poor service for what is supposed to be class hotel	Arrived at 5 p.m. and told room wasn't ready. Back at 7, 8 and 9 p.m.and not ready and no explanation. After four hour flight to get there, I was getting quite antsy. Desk clerk didn't seem to care or be particularly concerned. Finally went to the floor where the room was and found the lone maid who was still cleaning rooms at 9 p.m. She was at least an hour away from our room but immediately cleaned it when I explained the situation. Perhaps the maids should run the hotel. They seemed to be the only ones who cared. Finally got in and went to bed only to be awakened at 4 a.m. by two drunks screaming and swearing at each other down the hall...Never will stay here again."
167,303,"Jul 29 2009 	Great location but very expensive for what you get...	Spent 3 nights at CP this trip. LOVED our room. We were upgraded to a petite suite in the Palace tower. Room was gorgeous. His &amp; her bathrooms, shower for two, jacuzzi tub... but NO coffee maker. My girl loves her coffee in the morning so this was a big inconvenience each morning.We enjoyed our first stay at CP but we won't go out of our way to stay there again. It takes forever to get around there or to get from your room to the strip. Check in was pretty quick and the staff there were very friendly. My room was comped but I don't think I would stay there again if I had to pay. We have stayed at just about all the Harrah's properties and while CP is beautiful, we enjoy ourselves just as much, if not more, at their other properties. The pool area is still under construction but we did enjoy our time spent by the pools. We stayed by the main pool most of the time and enjoyed it. We did not order any drinks due to the high prices and chose to drink just before or after going to the pool.We did not eat once at CP as they were so much more expensive than neighboring casinos and the reviews have not shown me that they are justified charging those higher prices. our Friends ate at Ogdens and spent about $400 on dinner. They said it was really good but not sure if they would ever do it again. Did not have any luck in the CP casino. So ventured off and hit just about every hotel on the strip the first two nights. We wound up hitting Slots of Fun two nights in a row. It was so much fun to be able to play with actual quarters or dollars on the slot machines so we hit there twice. There is something about that place that is fun. Circus Circus apparently took over ownership of Slots of fun on July 1st so I hope they keep things the same. It is nice to see that on the strip amongst all the giants that are there.We also ventured downtown for a day and had much more luck playing down town. Was disappointed to see the downtown mall is closed up. Looks like it had just closed in June as there were posters for the movie theatre of movies that came out this past June. I saw Dodge Ball there for the 1st time a few years ago with my kids on a past trip so I was bummed to see that it closed.After spending some time at the Golden Nugget, I think we may stay there next trip. Some times I really enjoy spending time downtown and they have the best pool area so that is next on my list.I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas!!!"
168,303,"Jul 27 2009 	Rooms in oldest sections a little ""tired"" and only ""some"" staff are responsive to your complaints	We got a room for a week in one of the older (cheapest) sections and you can tell the rooms are dated. Our one sink in the bathroom did not drain very well, but we put up with that for the first day. However, by day #2, we noticed that if you tried to shower at an &quot;off time&quot; like at 2PM (or any time later than the &quot;usual&quot; morning shower time) the water NEVER got beyond &quot;luke warm&quot;! When we called down to the desk to complain, we felt the desk person &quot;blew us off&quot;. The person on the phone acted as though he really did not care, told us they would send someone up to &quot;check it out&quot; (they never did) and it was no better the 3rd. day! After another day of lukewarm water for a shower during an &quot;off time&quot;, we stopped down stairs at the desk on our way out for the day and complained to a woman behind the desk. She was really very nice and responsive and told us that because they felt bad that out first 3 days were less than what we should have experienced in Ceasars Palace, they would upgrade us for no extra charge to another room in another tower. They even moved our luggage from the old room to the new room while we were out for the day. The new room in a new tower was very obviously an upgrade and we were very pleased at how this woman had handled it. Perhaps the man we spoke with the day before on the phone was not as responsive or perhaps the lesson is to walk down to the desk and speak directly to someone!! Anyway, the rest of the visit in this hotel was very good. If you can avoid staying in the older (cheapest) rooms, I would advise that. But, because of how well that one woman at the desk handled our complaint, I would still advise staying here since the location is just great."
169,303,"Jul 27 2009 	Thank god for the complimentary upgrade.	Stayed at Caesar's for a three-day meeting, and the rate couldn't be beat. After checking into my room on the 15th floor, I found out why. It was dirty, nasty, and the cleaning staff had obviously lacked attention to detail (see pictures of the holes in the wall, cracked tissue box, missing light bulb, and the tellingly-stained desk chair). The deadbolt on the door didn't work, either.At first I thought I could stand it. Then I waited for two hours to get a new lightbulb and the lock fixed. But I couldn't take my eyes off that gross chair. I went down to the front desk armed with my pictures, and they upgraded me to a gorgeous suite. Thank god."
170,303,"Jul 27 2009 	Amazing Hotel	I'm not sure why there are even any negative reviews at all... I'd like to say that I absolutely one hundred and 10 percent loved our hotel and our room. First of all, the location is PRIME, it is on the mid - strip location, right next to the Bellagio and VERY close to Paris and Planet Hollywood, and on the other side, the Mirage... I think the location itself is ideal, as most other hotels lie south or north of the strip and can be a good walk to get to. I personally enjoyed Caesars decor and just the hotel itself better than the inside of the Bellagio and certain other ones, you tend to find that most look alike inside (casino areas, etc). We were fortunate enough to get upgraded to the Palace Tower, even though I had booked a Forum Tower, and I didn't even have to ask, she just implied that we had booked the Palace Tower (which is one of the newest towers). We arrived fairly late, at about 11:30 so there virtually was no line to check-in (during the day the line is pretty long... this is a big hotel, so it's expected).Furthermore, the room was amazing. Big king sized bed, the views of the pool (Palace Tower is right next to the pools) and the bathroom had a nice big sized jetted tub in it as well. Also, there is construction going on in the pool area, however, much to many complaints I have seen, I didn't think the construction bothered us at all, they play music and it kind of surpasses the construction noise, I thought. Also, it does get pretty full, we went right when they opened at 8:30 (it's GREAT at this time because you get to pick where to sit, ample options, and the heat isn't unbearable). The pool area was by far my favorite of the hotel, very classy and nice. Also, we had breakfast at Augustus' Cafe (about 36 total for 2 people) and it was probably the best breakfast I've ever had! (No joke)Taxis to and from the airport to this location on the strip are about $12-15, so not bad at all. All in all, this hotel far exceeded my expectations, and you'll LOVE it!!! ENJOY!"
171,303,"Jul 25 2009 	Love it	We loved the room,.and we got a great deal. There was a nice jacuzzi in the room - love it.Staff were friendly, buffet was nice. Great swimming pool, but was crowded because it was summer."
172,303,"Jul 25 2009 	stayed for a great rate	surprised at reasonable rate, went to restaurants and shops, saw rest of strip hotels.lv was better than we thought it might be."
173,303,"Jul 22 2009 	Nice clean friendly staff the place to stay on the strip	Booked for $130 a night mid-week. Got an upgrade by asking Justin at the front desk, got a nice suite a little larger overlooking the pool/26th floor. Rooms are beautiful, nice beds, lots of pillows, lots of towels in the bathroom, huge shower, jacuzzi tub. maybe a 32&quot; lcd tv minimal programming.Nice restaurants, lots of affordable shops, casino is classy. Spotless everywhere.The Pure Club goes off 7 nights a week, mostly hip-hop rap with some rock thrown in, mostly a 20's club. The pussycat gambling area has nice staff and is located next to the club and poker room.I just can't say enough nice things about this hotel, valet parking was reasonable retrieve.Now the cons: yes they are doing renovations on the west side of the pool. Minimal noise and intrusion, if this bothers you ask for a room facing the strip or north or south.Pools are nice, the lap pool is warmer, get there early to snake some lounge chairs, or reserve a monster poolside bed or cabana.EZ walk to NY, bellagio, mgm, planet hollywood-from there take the e-train to luxor/mandalay which is the south strip.I did not get a chance to eat at buffets, however as always SOuth Point is the best priced on the strip for large groups or families that can drive 5 minutes."
174,303,"Jul 22 2009 	AWESOME ROOM - BRING LOTS OF MONEY FOR FOOD!!!	My husband, daughter (12 yrs. old) and I arrived at McCarran from Newark around 11:30 am - bumpy flight. We were picked up by Presidential Limo (stretch). Very nice! Stopped at liquor store on way for supplies.Room: 5 Nights Comped at Forum Tower Deluxe (thanks to my Atlantic City Harrah's Play).Upon arrival at Caesar's, there had to be about 50 people in the check-in line....so the wait began. Finally, I &quot;tipped&quot; the check-in clerk $25 to get an upgrade from our Forum Tower Deluxe room to an Augustus Tower Deluxe Room (we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains! Room 3782).We had a refrigerator brought up (free of charge) and unpacked. Walked around hotel a bit....ate some lunch at Augustus Cafe and had a very nice lunch (expensive, though).Gambling Highlights: Played mostly 3-card poker, VP, and Blackjack. Went up and down on the table games, although I did get three &quot;6's&quot; - the sign of the beast, which paid 30 to 1 on my $25 bet. Not too bad, but I ended up giving it back eventually. VP machines at Caesars were scarce, so I played at the VP Bar by the Sportsbook. They sure know how to pour drinks over there....I don't remember getting back to the room that night....and YES I LOST AGAIN!I did have fun and met some nice people. My husband played in a few poker tourneys, didn't win either. We have a curse with Harrah's properties, as we never win at any of them (even in Atlantic City). We are good with Boyd/MGM though. Went to Bellagio and won $250 within 5 minutes on a $.25 slot! Go figure!Food: Went to Bellagio Buffet. Had to have the giant Alaskan King Crab Legs and the Prime Rib. Excellent! We all got our money's worth that night for sure!Caesar's Food Court: Beware! Food isn't bad, but God forbid you want a slice of pepperoni pizza, you'll pay $6.50 for it! Or how about $4 for one bagel?Rao's: Inside Caesar's. Very nice meal - excellent food. It should be for $160.00 (without liquor)!Otherwise, ate at Caesar's Cafe Lago Buffet for breakfast only. I heard it sucked and it sure did. Awful - stay away. The eggs were runny, no selection, too expensive, etc.Mostly went to the Payard Pattisere coffee shop for breakfast sandwich/coffee. Ate at BLT Burger at Mirage one night - very good food and reasonably priced!Went to Joe's Prime Steak and Stone Crab on our last night (Fri.) for our 15th anniversary. Excellent steak and crab! Yes, you sure do pay for it, but the food/service is excellent. I think I saw a few celebrities there as well!POOL: The pool at Caesar's is still under construction. You don't hear the noise too much, as they play loud music. 2 main pools are open, but we pretty much stayed by the round main one. No, there was no styrofoam or dust or dirt from the construction in the pool at all. Get there before 9:00 for decent seats. It opens at 8:00 a.m.Tip: Don't order a beer at the pool - it's $8 for one, or $18 for a frozen drink. Ouch! We learned early and brought water most of the time.Fun: I had to take my daughter to the NY/NY Rollercoaster or I would never hear the end of it. $28 later, we rode it (I shut my eyes the whole time - I don't like heights!). We went to their arcade, Rainforest Cafe for lunch at MGM Grand.I took my daughter across street to Flamingo Wildlife Habitat - Nice birds, turtles, Koi fish! Went shopping.Went to the Dirk Arthur Extreme Magic Show at Tropicana - very nice magic show with Lions. Good value at $30, as well! QUA SPA: I had my husband booked for a massage for his early birthday present. They run a $99 special Sun - Wed. with full use of the spa/gym all day and a massage. He enjoyed it up until the end when he slipped and fell in the steam room. He hurt his back. They did fill out accident report, but that's about it. No follow up calls to see how he was doing or anything. I did enjoy the spa baths and steamrooms (especially the artic ice room), however.Thus, with my husband layed up with a hurt back, we couldn't go see Love as we had wanted to. Next time for sure. He's feeling much better now!So, that pretty much sums it up! Much drinking, gambling with little wins, a couple of nice restaurants, alot of pool time, and the token arcade/magic show for the little one. We all had a good time and Caesar's took an extra $150 off the final bill in comps~!"
175,303,"Jul 22 2009 	STILL AMAZING	Its location still makes this the best hotel in vegas.And dont be put off by the renovations ,this is still the BEST pool in VEGAS."
176,303,"Jul 22 2009 	Stay only for the location	Caesar's is an ok place to stay, but I certainly wasn't blown away by anything there. I've had better service other places. We were given an upgraded room, but had to switch rooms and were downgraded again. We were there for a conference and I think its hard to go to Vegas for a conference, because you have to be up at 6 am to attend. We ended up having to switch rooms because we were on a nonsmoking floor and there was a HUGE party of young men in the room across the hallway smoking like chimney's in their room and Security wouldn't do anything about it. They were also in and out ALLLLL NIGHT LONG. Which is to be expected in Vegas so we couldn't really hold it against them for having a good time. But, we could not sleep with the smoke and noise and had to ask to be moved. EVERYTHING is a ripoff at Caesar's. If you stay, make sure you have deep pockets. I need not bore you with the details. Rooms were VERY CLEAN. We stayed in the forum tower. Housekeeping was good/friendly. The elevators are nice and quick...never had to wait. The location is one of the best on the strip, but I think I would try another hotel in the same area next time. I don't think it is worth the price because who wants to be in their room in vegas anyway?Pool construction is still going on, but there are a couple of pools open."
177,303,Jul 21 2009 	great place	Fantastic hotel. Brilliant location for exploring the strip. So many amenities with great shopping and eating at the Forum Shops.
178,303,Jul 20 2009 	Fantastic Visit	We always stay across the street at Harrah's and thought we'd try Caesar's this time. I was comped 3 nights stay and given a room in Classic Tower. After reading poor reviews on the Classic rooms I asked for an upgrade. We were given a beautiful room on the 68th (of 69 ) floor with a strip view. We had a few meals at the Cafe Lafo Buffet; not too many choices for the price. Overall great trip! Treated very well.
179,303,"Jul 18 2009 	Nothing Special!	Stayed at Caesar's Palace for three nights. The only reason I stayed at Caesar's was because we got a fantastic deal. Enjoyed my stay, however I would likely not stay here again unless it was super cheap. Here are the pros &amp; cons in my opinion:Pros:- Spacious Room- Jacuzzi Tub in Room- Clean- Overall, great customer service.- Toileteries replaced everydayCons:- Long line-ups upon check-in- Pool under construction, you can't relax by the poolside due to the jackhammers!- Takes forever to exit the casino/hotel because the towers are far away from the entrance/exit- No mini bar/fridge in room- Late checkout only 1 hour later- Noisy AC unitOverall, I enjoyed my stay. It served it's purpose to sleep and shower while we were in Vegas. However, I prefer smaller sized hotel where you don't need to walk 10 mins just to get outside."
180,303,"Jul 16 2009 	Relaxation Heaven	I have been coming to Vegas several times a year for over eight years and I stayed at Caesar's for the first time on this trip. I was able to register early and after I asked the desk clerk upgraded me to a beautiful room in the Augustus Tower with a view of the Bellagio Fountains. If you can manage a room in this fairly new tower DO IT. The jetted tub was sensational, the bed heavenly and room service was prompt and pretty reasonable. There is a 5.00 service fee and an automatic 18% gratuity so it may not be for everyone, but I was traveling alone and so it was fine. The Cafe Lago breakfast buffet is good but limited. The coffee was great though. The best part of the whole trip was Qua Baths. There is a 45.00 entry fee per day, but it entitles you to the use of the workout facility and the incredible spa for the whole day. If you use a spa service (Salon services like pedicures do not count) use of the facilities is included. I had a massage - ask for Kira M., she was really terrific. All in all it was a wonderful visit and I will be making Caesars Palace my new destination in Vegas."
181,303,"Jul 15 2009 	All hail Caesar!	Our experience at Caesars Palace probably made this the best Vegas Vacation we have taken.Location  Best location on the strip, about midway up. Next to Bellagio, across the street from the Flamingo, which means the Venetian or MGM is only a 10 minute walk away. Even if you dont like the casino at Caesars, you are very close to a range of others. And if shows are your thing, there is a half price tix booth right across the street at Bills. Check-in  We checked in at 1:15am (thanks crazy reduced airline schedules!), but this seemed to work to our advantage; the line was non-existent (just one person in front of us), and we got a free upgrade! The staff member was on the computer for 5 minutes or so with the occasional apology for the delay, but then declared that the rooms werent coming up so he upgraded us! We booked the Classic Room, but got an Augustus Tower room (needless to say, this review might have been different if we had got the room we paid for!). Staff member at reception was very polite and helpful despite the late hour. Worth noting that when we passed reception at other times, lines were huge, so if you are arriving at an earlier hour, bring a book. Room  Augustus Tower Rooms are marvelous! The dcor is modern, with just enough hints of the Roman theme to fit without being tacky. The view was of the strip and the mountains, if you looked to the side of the window  otherwise straight ahead was just the roofs of the casino buildings (they should really think about putting solar panels on them  such a waste of space!). The bed was very comfortable, room was clean. Nice sofa and armchairs, so when relaxing one doesnt have to sit on the bed like a teenager in his room. Closet had a safe, robes and slippers. The bathroom had twin sinks (always a wife-pleaser), a separate small room for the toilet, a TV and separate bath and shower, with the bath being a whirlpool bath! After reading reviews on this site I didnt even touch the mini-bar fridge for fear of false billing. TV had a nice selection of channels, and was a new LCD. Restaurants  Every time we went past most of the restaurants, there was a line, so we ate elsewhere. Amenities  Casino is a nice size, but didnt have a lot of Video Poker (our game of choice) so we ended up not gambling here at all. Have gambled here in the past, but there is just something that doesnt make it appealing. Didnt use the pools, so no comment on them. We did however use the Qua Spa, and I have to say it is phenomenal! You can use the gym for $25, or the whole facility for $45  I recommend the $45 day pass! I was shown the facilities and given a locker, as well as robe and slippers, then set off for the gym. The gym is very well equipped and compares favorably to some private gyms, let alone the usual sad excuse for a hotel gym. Post workout, your options are incredible  plan to spend a whole afternoon here! Sauna, steam room (so steamy I couldnt see anything beyond 2 feet), steam room with eucalyptus, and a cold room, with moisturizing snow! There is a hot tub, as well as roman mineral baths, of different temperatures. Showers have body wash, shampoo and conditioner in them as standard. Once done, you can shave in the well lit bathroom (shaving gel and razors provided), then relax in the tea room, which has a large TV showing ESPN, magazines for men, a range of five different fancy teas, as well as snacks, fruit and choices of water or juices. At no point did I feel pressured to leave or hurry up. If the rest of your vacation involves late nights, drinking and over-indulging this is the perfect recovery for you. The only time I got a bit miffed was with the staff at the gift shops, who really didn't seem interested in serving someone who only wanted to buy a postcard, to the point where I just walked out the first one after waiting a ridiculous amount of time. Checkout  I checked the bill online through the hotel TV, and there was almost no wait at reception to get a copy of the bill and hand the keys in. Bill was correct, staff very friendly. Overall, the best experience at a hotel in Vegas so far. If you are one of those picky people that want fresh soap every day, and new towels and your slightest whim at a moments notice, then you may be disappointed. As someone that just wants a nice clean room, working amenities and a correct bill, I was very happy."
182,303,"Jul 14 2009 	Great Place to Stay!!!	Three friends and I traveled to Vegas because one of us was attending a conference. The rest of us piggy backed on his room. At check in we were offered an upgrade but due to using &quot;company&quot; funds he declined. Once we arrived in the &quot;Romar Tower&quot; room we promptly exited and went back for the upgrade. There's a reason there are no pictures of this room on Ceasar's website. It looked like a Motel 6 room. Once back at the check in desk we asked for the before mentioned upgrade. The clerk had already assigned that room so she gave us an even bigger room in the &quot;Augustus Tower&quot;, for the same price as the smaller room. Lets just say we made a good decision. The room was clean, well furnished, great view, and we all slept well with no outside noise heard. As with most rooms in vegas, there was no coffee maker, no fridge, etc. Stay away from the food and drink bar. If you lift an item out of it's place, a sensor is alerted and you will be charged. We had to get creative when icing down our beer. The beds were very comfortable and AC worked very good. WiFi in the room is $15.00 a day.The restaurants at Ceasar's are very expensive, $77.00 ribeye is a bit much. We only ate at Ceasar's for breakfast, in the food court. Average price for a 3 egg omelet, 4 pieces of toast, potatoes, and large coffee was $14.00. A little high but we couldn't eat all we were served. We did have a late night bacon cheesburger combo one night, same food court, $15.00, and it too was huge. Very good food as well. I utilized the workout facilities for the three of the four days while there. It's normally $25.00 a day but they had a 3 days for $50.00 deal which was o.k. The gym was clean and the equipment was new but it lacked somewhat in space. It has a very small area for the hand weights and free weights. Other than that I was able to get a good workout in.If you plan on getting some sun by the pool, plan on getting down there before 1000 a.m. If you don't, you'll find yourself walking in circles waiting on a chair to open. Even though it was crowded the chairs are only 3 rows deep in most areas so it wasn't too bad. Drinks at the pool are around $12.00 for 12 ounce and $19.00 for 16 ounce. Some kids but not alot. That&quot;s important to me as I don't want to listen to a bunch screaming and crying while lounging. Spoke to a security guard who told us that two additional pools are supposed to open in Aug. 09 but they may be running a bit behind. That would bring the total to 5 pools. The slots paid pretty well at Ceasar's. Three out of four of us took extra cash home from the slots. Can't speak for the blackjack tables or poker.All in all the hotel is very clean and well maintained. No complaints about any of the staff. Plenty of bar maids both in the casino and at the pool. I'm already planning another trip in Sept. of this year and I will be staying at Ceasar's Palace."
183,303,"Jul 12 2009 	Treated as a valued customer.	After an initial wait on the priority line (as a Platinum Reward Member), with those with the Gold card being taken ahead of me despite the intent of the PRIORITY line, the service was quick and supportive. The staff on initial registration and sign out were efficient, polite, and helpful. Although I was not placed in the wing I initially booked a room in, the room I received had a wonderful view. Even as a solo traveller, I felt safe and at ease. I will definitely stay at Caesars again and will recommend it to friends and family members - based on my experience. BTW - I even treated myself to a hair salon treatment (coloring) with my long time earned points and was again treated with respect."
184,303,Jul 12 2009 	Okay Stay	I stayed here for 2 nights as part of my nine day stay and did enjoy it. The rooms were comfortable but a little dirty. The bathroom was awesome had a shower and bathtub separate. There was construction going on at the pool that was annoying couldn't relax. Lots of slots to choose from on the casino floor. Good drink service and nice costumes. The shops were fun lots and lots of them top of the line. I probaly would not stay here again but it was not bad I just didn't feel that comfortable there.
185,303,"Jul 11 2009 	If you are going for the pool......wait a while	Can't beat some of the rates in Vegas right now so we couldn't resist a quick week vacation. We picked Caesars Palace for it's great mid-strip location (we didn't plan to really leave the strip and did not want to rent a car). Here's how we found it:Location = Mid-strip can't beat it. You will do a lot of walking with thousands of complete strangers but....that's Vegas. The hotel is HUGE, lots and lots of walking so bring the right shoes.Rooms = We upgraded to the Palace tower upon arrival for an additional $25.00 a night. This is the closest tower to the pool and that was one of main reasons for going. The room was very spacious as was the bathroom, excellent jacuzzi tub and separate shower. We heard horror stories about the Roman tower and wanted to avoid it at all costs.Housekeeping = top notch, room was kept very clean and no personal items were disturbed.Prices = Food and drink are not cheap at Caesars; the food court is the best bet where most meals were about $10.00 each. Soft drinks at the pool are $3 to $4 a piece. Alcohol at the bars is armed robbery, one night my wife and I each had a simple shot and it was $30.00 for both!Pools = You may have heard the pools are being upgraded or rather new additions. They are in the process of adding new pools and finishing construction on a new tower and meeting facilities.....all of this is around the pool. Dust and construction noise surround 50% of the pool area and you can't help but notice them. The pool chairs fill up on the early side, we were at the pool by 8am and had no problem but by 11am you were out of luck. There are two main pools available now with a 3rd &quot;European&quot; pool available for an extra charge. Not enough chairs for the crowd that hits the area so get there early if you want to sit.Bottom line; nice and big place pick the right tower and wait a few months if you plan on spending time at the pool."
186,303,"Jul 10 2009 	Perfact Vacation!!!	I had a great package deal at Travelocity (I booked about 6 week advance) for this hotel.Upon check-in, I asked the very friendly desk clerk if I can get any complimentary upgrades, and she upgraded us to a Forum Tower, which is one of newly innovated tower - everything in the room were cleannnnn!! If you don't ask, you will not get it. Don't ever touch anything in the fridge in your room, eventhough you don't open, they scan things that removed and charge you for it.We did not try the restaurents in this hotel (very expensive, but I am sure they are good), but we tried at Beijing Noodle 9. If you like a chiness food, you got to try! Handmade noodle and dumpling are just perfact! Average entry costs for 12-18 dollors. *** Try at &quot;KOKOMOS&quot; at Mirage Hotel - they have Pre Fixed Menu (you have to ask) for 29.99, and it was amazing!!! 3 course meal, nice atmosphere, good food.***Sushi Roku at Forum Shop - the best fresh sushi I never had. Try live sweet shrimp, the best!!!You will not see any $5 table game in this hotel. The lowest table I saw was $15. Most of them are $25 min.Shopperholic? Forum Shop got everything (all expensive designer handbags and cloth...you know the deal) I will recomand the Prime Outlet Mall - great deals on nice brand names.Overall, we just had stay at Caesars Palace and we will definately go back!"
187,303,"Jul 10 2009 	Wow!	I had taken an early flight and arrived at Caesars at 10:30am. I was somewhat concerned because I knew that check-in was at 3:00pm. There were perhaps a half dozen folks also attempting to check-in early.The woman at the front desk was very friendly and accomodating. She was able to find me a room (and EVEN upgraded it at no cost). I was in the Palace Tower right near the pool. This was perhaps the easiest tower to get to. You must walk through the rather smokey casino to get to the elevator.I was on the 20th floor and my room faced the Strip towards the right and mountains to the left. Wow! The room was huge. The furniture was modern, but simple. The king bed had very comfortable sheets, pillows and comforter..lots of huge pillows. The matress was firm, but not too hard. The air conditioner system worked flawlessly. The thermostat is on the wall, my room was hot when I arrived so I cooled it down to 70 and it only took about 15 minutes to achieve this.The bathroom was about the size of my living room.A stall shower, two sinks and a sunkin jacuzzi. I had no idea where the toilet was. Aha, it was behind the door and included a phone. The tv was flat screen and received an impressive amount of channels.A robe was included in the closet. The toiletries had a tangy, orange scent. I loved the lotion.There was an ipod docking unit/radio, but the docking did not work and the radio only picked up a few stations. High speed internet cost $14.95 per 24 hour. At times the internet was quite slow.The room was incredibly quiet. I never heard a door slam or noise from another room.It was very clean. My only objection was the maid walking into my room at 9:00am and didn't even knock. I guess she must have assumed that I was still out partying/gambling. You can check the cost you have accrued to your room on the hotel's tv channel. In addition, you can check out after 6:00am utilizing the hotel tv channel.The casino is large and perhaps one of the more sought out on the strip. I have heard that many people come over to Caesars to play the slots and cards. The casino floor went on and on and on. Unlike Atlantic City (which has smoking sections), smoking is everywhere! Even if you just walk through the casinos on your way to somewhere else, you are bound to get smoke blown in your face.After you leave the casino you are immersed in a huge shopping area with some of the most upscale shoppes in Vegas. The stores go on and on and you can get lost trying to navigate from one side to the other. The price of a Coach purse actually was higher then it would have been at Macy's, but I'll always remember where I bought it. The ceiling is a distinct blue and the area is very posh and made to look like a Roman street. Caesars is one of the largest hotels and it takes about 2 days to figure out how to get from point A to point B. There is a LOT of walking involved. Some times I found it easier to exit and walk outside then maneuver the massive maze.The Coliseam is the theatre where the top stars like: Cher and Bette Midler play. I saw Bette and had wonderful seats and she put on an impressive show.The pool is waist deep(so don't expect to be able to swim). It is a large circle surrounded by fountains and sculptures of caesar. There is contruction going on near the pool (a new tower is being added). The music at the pool was so loud, it drowned out any of the construction noise.There were many young people when I was there in the pool and nearly all had drinks in their hands. It was hot and the pool was crowded. If you want to get some exercise, you can actually walk around the pool a few times.You have to get down early because the lounge chairs get filled up quickly. I tried to get my space staked out between 930-1030am. Those who came in the area after 1100 did not have much luck finding a place to lounge. There is also a &quot;European&quot; pool located just outside of the doors.This is an adult-only pool area and the women can go topless.The waitress/bar staff at the pool are agonizingly slow. I ordered a drink and it arrived about 45 mins. later. It just appears that they do not have the adequate amount of staff to services a large crowd.I treated myself to a massage near the pool (in the shade) for $50 for a half hour. The masseuse was fantastic and very friendly.The pool store is very overprised. Unless you want to pay $12-$15 for suntan lotion (bring your lotion from home). Soda's cost over $2.00 a bottle and snacks range from $2.00-$4.00.There are loads of restaraunts, but they are quite expensive. I ate one large meal at the Japanese restaraunt (which I was told had among the best sushi in Vegas). The sushi was by far among the best I have ever had, fresh and tasteful. The cost was $25.00 for two rolls.One word to describe the Caesars staff--Accomodating.The cost of the stay was well worth it."
188,303,"Jul 8 2009 	All Class and NO Hass..le	Before arriving for a 3 night stay, I found a tip online about how to get a free upgrade from the Roman Towers which is where my reservation was booked for $81 a night with the AAA discount. At check-in you simply fold a $20 bill with your ID and Credit card and ask if there are any complimentary upgrades.. It worked like a charm! Got upgraded to the Palace Tower with Queen sized beds and Jacuuzzi!.. Best $20 you will ever gamble in Vegas! There is nothing about this hotel that is not 1st class. I've stayed at the Bargain hotels ( Flamingo, Riviera,..ect.) This time decided to pay a little extra, and it was WELL worth it.. you will be proud to say you are staying at Fabulous Ceasars Palace! And you can always walk across the street to gamle at Harrahs or Flamingo for the lower table minimums. All employees are friendly and helpful... and the Pool area is unbelievably nice.. When you sign up for a players card they will give you a $20 voucher for the buffet which is pretty good for breakfast."
189,303,"Jul 8 2009 	Good but too big and generic.	Went for a bachelor party and while the hotel is good - it's far too big - takes ages to get from room to casino floor or exit or pool.The crowd is totally universal - families, old people, party people so it's a bit of mish mash.We got an upgrade and the room was HUGE but this hotel is not for 20 somethings.Still a good hotel though."
190,303,"Jul 6 2009 	Had a wonderful time July 4th weekend 2008	I went w/ family from Miami -only been to Vegas twice and we enjoyed Caesars Palace that we (Girl Friend) and I will be staying there at the end of this month. You hear so much negivatve reviews, I truly think if you plan on having a good time you will, if not you wont-so the key is go to Vegas and just have a good time -Caesars is the best place to stay for the shopping extravaganga, if you are not a gambler- and the Food is great too!!!"
191,303,Jul 1 2009 	great 42nd wedding anniversity	two great employee's Cheryl Ippolito set up our 4 day stay and Marc. Mercury front desk help during our stay. Have been coming to Caesars since 1987 every Jan &amp; June we had a great time looking forward to returning in Jan
192,303,Jul 1 2009 	Blood on the sheets	I found blood on my sheets after I had slept on them for 2 days. They acted like it was my fault and took a long time to come and replace them. I could tell that it was tried to be washed off.NEVER STAY HERE again!!!!
193,303,"Jun 30 2009 	Check your insurance	10+ visits to Vegas, 1st stay at Caesars. Room we booked was not available at check-in, given best available at reduced rate and moved to better room for second night. As the second night wore on, I started feeling bad. By the time I made it back to the room, I was not able to leave the toilet (not a drinker btw). By the next morning my wife was woried and threatened to cal EMS. She agreed to look elsewhere and found &quot;In Room Doctor&quot;. Dr. arrived and advised we most likely got it from the room(s). I say we because, yes the wife got it as well. $2000.00 later, we were able to leave the room for the airport. Good thing I had hit a couple of jack pots prior to near death experience. I can't say for sure the hotel was to blame, but all we were offered even after complete explanation to guest relations, was late check out. Not a clean freak, but we carry sanitizer wipes and gel when we travel now.Still get queasy when I walk by there!"
194,303,"Jun 29 2009 	First Trip to Caesars and Definitely Won't be the Last	This was our first trip to Caesars Palace. We had 3 nights comped in the Forum Tower. When checking in, told the woman it was our 15th anniversary and she upgraded us to the Palace Tower when she found out my wife liked the pool. The room was the nicest non suite room we have stayed in before in Las Vegas. I enjoyed how quiet it was in the pool area, not a lot of kids like you get at some of the other hotels. The casino was even quiet, which actually was quite nice. The food is very expensive there so we ate elsewhere. We will definitely be returning next year to Caesars Palace."
195,303,"Jun 29 2009 	Really Poor service	We arrived at the hotel at 1530hrs local.Having travel there with Virgin Atlantic where we received excellent service. Because my wife uses a wheelchair I emailed the hotel in advance to explain that we were travelling with our daughter and son-in law and because of the wheelchair and the help needed from them I asked if our rooms could be close, at least on the same floor. On arrival we again requested this. After a lot of them trying to get us to pay for an upgrade they said they had two rooms for us but one was not made up but would be done soon. We waited an hour and checked...still not made up. We went to eat and arrived back at 2000hrs still no room. After much talk with every one blaming every one else they agreed to give us another room in a different block. We said we still required the room and they agreed that it would be ready for us next day. After a long trip and being very tired this was the last thing we expected on arrival at a high cost hotel. We were not alone other people were in the same situation and were bitterly complaining. The service through out the whole hotel was very poor unless you were spending. But we explained that we had spent a lot with the price we paid to stop there. The Buffet here is possible the worst on the Strip and high priced to boot. We ate at The Luxor which we highly recommend."
196,303,"Jun 29 2009 	Hail Caesar...Emperor of the Strip	After booking our trip we were a little worried following some of the recent traveler reviews.... we booked a classic room and upon arrival (and only waiting for 2 minutes to get checked in) we got a recently refurbished Forum Tower room!!! The room was great, although the view of the back of the Colosseum wasn't anything to write home about...The pool area was a little more crowded than our last visit thanks to the construction work, that said we always managed to find 2 beds next to each other on the six occassions that we visited at various times of day!!! The waitress service was friendly, efficient and plentiful.......We ate a couple of times at the new offering Serendipity 3, which had a good menu and lovely food...Our only real constructive observation is on the table play, which could certainly have benefited from some lower minimums throughout our stay, which lead us to play mainly in other locations.Overall.....Hail Caesar...Emperor of the Strip...we would definitely stay here again...especially when the new pool area is finished...."
197,303,"Jun 29 2009 	The Best	Caesers was a great place. They made a few mistakes, but quickly recovered. I would highly reccommend anyone looking to go to Vegas to stay here. It ain't cheap, but if you want cheap, go somewhere else. First class in everything they did or tried to do."
198,303,"Jun 28 2009 	Great Experience	My husband and I come to Vegas on a regular basis and have stayed at Caesars a couple of times prior to this trip. Once again, we were not disappointed. We had booked a deluxe room for 4 nights and were supposed to be in the Palace/Augustus Tower. Upon check-in, my husband presented the very friendly desk clerk with his drivers license anda twenty dollar bill and asked if any complimentary upgrades were available (we had never tried this before but had read a lot about it lately on various web sites). Amazingly enough, there were no more deluxe rooms available and we were upgraded to a Forum Tower Royal Suite! The room was unbelievable, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the ameneties offed at the hotel are top notch! After staying in such surroundings, it's hard to come back to the real world. My husband and I will definitely be returning to Ceasars again!!!!!"
199,303,"Jun 28 2009 	Dissappointed...room was old...bad customer service..not worth it ..!!!!	Well, me and my hb booked in one of their Roman Tower rooms.... Big dissappointment..very old and the aircon was scary..It had a loud sound during the night..did not sleep well. Furthermore, the tv armoire was not positioned well..we could see all the wirings on the back and almost blocking the bathroom door... So, we called their customer service to fix it but they just told us that it was really ike that...They did not even bother to check the room...Also, they double-charged my credit card..They charged me when I booked it and when we checked in they charged me again..of the cost plus $100 dollars for incidental exp...we complained after learning it...the customer service was not friendly..my hb has to shout on them just to listen to our complain...but until now they haven't credited back my credit card...It was not worth it for the price and for the hassle...we will never stay on this hotel anymore...shame on them!!!!"
200,303,"Jun 23 2009 	The Roman Gods would even love this place!!!	We had a party of 5 and 3 had never been to Vegas before. I wanted to make sure that they enjoy everything Vegas has to offer so I booked Caesars Palace. I like the location, center of strip, and the price was reasonable. I booked the trip through Expedia and originally had rooms in the Classic Towers. After reading reviews on tripadvisor, I knew that it would be wise to upgrade. Upon arrival I requested an upgrade and we were put in the Palace Towers(with tip only). The difference was like night and day. The rooms in the Palace Towers are fantastic and very comfortable. Our view was over looking the pool and it was good, even with construction. To me the construction is part of progress, so you just have to deal with alittle inconvience. The food and drink by the pool was somewhat expensive but it is the same wherever you stay on the strip. You do have to get out there fairly early because they will run out of chairs as the day goes on! Once construction ends there will be alot more room. The casino could have been laid out better, but once you get familiarized, it gets easier to navigate. It would also be better to have some lower minimums on some tables.Every kind of restaurant is available. Shop-a-holics would also feel right at home. You don't ever have to leave this hotel if you don't want to. Everybody loved Caesars and would come back anytime!"
201,303,"Jun 23 2009 	Disappointing a real shame!!!	I have travelled to Vegas a number of times for leisure and business, I have stayed in Caesars palace in 2007 and had a wonderful time.On this occasion I went with my husband and parents, brother and family and said that Ceasars had been a really nice place to stay so we all booked in! The location of Caesars is ideal, right in the middle of the strip. The only negative point is that if you have problems with walking it does not have a sky train station, however there is one about 15mins walk away.The reception was busy as Vegas always is however there were only two people checking in at 1700. We booked the three rooms together and asked for them to be on the same floor, however the reception said they were unable to do this. We took a room on the floor below. Once at the rooms none of our card keys worked and we had to take them all back to reception to be re-programmed. The rooms themselves were a nice size and had everything you could need. However all our rooms had little problems. We had no batteries in our remote, no robes and no shower gel. My parents room had no slippers, three of the spotlights in bathroom out of order. My brothers had no toiletries and no toilet roll. The rooms were however clean.As the week went we had to ask reception for toiletries when we needed them, rather than them just being replaced by house keeping. It is not the cheapest hotel, but was still a mid-range and from previous stays I expected so much more!!The hotel buffet breakfast was probably the worst meal we had in Vegas. We arrived at 0900 to find tables as far as the eye could see of dirty crockery. Adventurely after the table had been cleared around us we ordered our coffee and juice. The coffee was warm and with no sugar on the table we took a bowl from another empty table as there were no servers around to ask. When one of the servers did arrive they told us those sugars were not for us and we would have to find our own server to get sugar! When we went up for food there was little left, and it was all cold and not particularly nice! We did not return to the Ceasars Buffet, instead we walked up to Treasure Island which was a pleasant stroll at that time of the morning.I am coming back to Vegas next month and staying at Treasure Island which I much prefer!All in all I was so disappointed with what use to be a truely fabulous hotel!!!"
202,303,Jun 23 2009 	Absolutely Wonderful Vacation! DCN in Texas	This was our first stay at Ceasars Palace. We usually vacation in Las vegas twice a year and have stayed at several other strip hotels. This was one of the best vacations we have had in Las Vegas. We checked in on June 10th around 7:30pm. The room was not available due to issues with the room key computer system not working. The front desk personnel were so sweet and apologetic. They offered to assign the room and have security meet us at the assigned room in 30 minutes. We chose to wait it out and enjoy the exciting atmosphere. In around 15 minutes we were told the system was working and we were assigned a beautiful room in the Augustus Tower. The beds were so comfortable and the strip view was amazing! We both had great luck on the slot machines (my husband enjoyed the craps table) the drink service was quick and friendly. We cannot say enough about the friendly staff we encountered. We had a wonderful vacation and look forward to returning again in July to celebrate my birthday!
203,303,"Jun 23 2009 	Absolutley Amazing	After reading all the reviews on here i must admit i was worried about getting a bad room! When we arrived we just asked for an upgrade- we said that we had heard the rumours about the mouldy old rooms on the internet in the roman tower &amp; they upgraded us for free- we did tip her $20, but even still if you don't ask you don't get!We had the most amazing time, this hotel is the biggest &amp; best on the strip, fab staff, casinos, restaurants, pools- even towels &amp; neccesity shops were all really fab- it is much cheaper to get beers/drinks from the little shops than it is off the pool staff/pool bar?If you tip (it doesn't have to be loads a dollar a time) the waitresses etc will be very helpful.There is soooooooo much to do in this hotel &amp; this whole place (we did grand canyon sunset helicopter tour-it was amazing!!!)You will not be dissapointed- our room was out of this world a view of the bellagio fountains, huge bed, LCD TV ,table &amp; chairs, a settee- massive bathroom, double sinks, jet bath, huge walk in shower with LCD TV in bathroom- storage was amazing the whole room was soooooo fantastic! We stayed in the augustus tower!!"
204,303,"Jun 22 2009 	Good enough for a couple days	We stayed in Caesars for 5 days and our room was comped so I can't talk about price. Let's start with the good,Check in is fast if you're a platinum member We needed an extra bed cuz (of the room change) and they were at the room with the bed before we even put out bags downThe cleaning staff was friendly and gave us extra towels whenever we asked.The waitresses were nice and promptThe locationVariety of places to eatNow the badIf you're not a platinum member and you arrive at the wrong time of day, you're gonna wait in a lineThe pool is ordinary, just pools and lots of construction going on around youThe food is very overpriced even in the &quot;food court&quot;For a slot player, the casino is small and doesn't have alot of optionsThis is not a kid friendly hotelWhen we checked in I didn't get the room I booked,in the Forum Tower (hence the extra rollaway bed)The service at the Total Rewards booth was rudeThe room towers are far from check in Now that being said, would I pay for this hotel? Probably not. Would I go back? Maybe if I were without my kids. (comped) This year we've stayed in The Bellagio, Paris and MGM so I'm comparing Caesars to them. I'll put it third. Piece of advice, always use your players card, and if you're a party of 6, like we were, go to the front desk and check out the prices of limos to the airport home. It's cheaper than 2 cabs, because in Vegas you can't put more than 5 people in a cab, even if its a mini van. I give Caesars a 2.5 only because the beds are soo comfy and the rooms we had were awesome and the shopping is great."
205,303,"Jun 22 2009 	Brilliant better than expected!	Well, we booked this with Lowcostvegas.com, and then read reviews about the rooms etc you end up with when booking through them which definitely worried me a little. We got there in the morning and the room wasn't ready (but it did say you couldn't check in til 1pm, so we didn't think it would be) and left our bags with concierge and went off for a wander down the strip. Came back at 1 and was told the room still wasn't ready, so we waited another 20 minutes, and was told it still wasn't ready, but they would put us in a different room to make up for it. We got there and it was fantastic, the room was immaculate, two double beds, the view was amazing (got half the mountains and the other half was the strip).The customer service was brilliant, especially since we had booked through that website, I thought they would possibly be a bit off, but they treated us like we had paid for the penthouse suite or something.I would definitely recommend it to others."
206,303,"Jun 19 2009 	Nice Surprise !!	Invited guest to Caesars for free room &amp; tickets to Bette Midler. Very concerned after all the reviews, hadn't stayed there in many years. What a nice surprise !! Checked in on Mon afternoon Requested a room with a great view, no walls-parking lots etc ! I did tip the clerk &amp; was given a FANTASTIC room Augustus Towers 45th floor,overlooking the fountains of Bellagio. WOW !! Very clean, housekeeping did a great job!QUA is a must see. Compare in every way to Canyon Ranch. A smaller facility &amp; probably very crowded on weekends, but great during the week.Tickets to Bette were row G. No dissapointments. She can still sing, dance &amp; tell her dirty jokes without skipping a beat. Would go again &amp; pay for the tickets !!Restaurants were great !! Mesa Grill a bargin for Bobby Flay !Only dissapointment was the casino, &amp; I didn't loose. Cage was poorly staffed &amp; no matter when I went the wait was endless. Voucher machines not working for an entire night and the next night pt bosses not able to enter ratings on players card. To bad for me, because I probably played for over six hours &amp; with no rating-- HOW WILL I GET INVITED BACK?"
207,303,"Jun 18 2009 	A Great Location For Our Stay in Las Vegas	We stayed in Las Vegas during Memorial Day weekend, May 22nd through the 27th at Caesars, which was our first trip. (Well actually it was almost 30 years for me, so I might as well say it was my first trip!) We had a choice for any comped room in the HET properties, so we decided to stay at Caesars for the location, and pool facilities. I must say, I was not disappointed with the hotel, nor was I totally satisfied. It was okay, but I would probably stay somewhere else next time we go.We arrived Friday night, landing about 10:00pm. We got our car, and proceeded to WalMart to buy a coffee pot. (They actually charge per night for a coffee pot, so we bought one for $10.00 and left it in the room when we checked out.) The walk from the self park to check in seemed endless. Yes, this hotel is enormous! I thought people were exaggerating, or didnt like to walk, but they really werent kidding! My suitcase handle broke during transit, so it was difficult trying to drag the suitcase on the carpeting throughout the casino trying to find the registration desk. By the time we got to the hotel, it was already 12:00 midnight (3:00 am EST), so maybe I was a little tired and testy too. After doing the research on Trip Advisor, I reserved the Forum Tower above the Classic Room, and was a little apprehensive that we would lose this room due to the late check-in, especially since it was comped. But to our surprise, they up-graded us to the Palace Towers, 20th floor. The room was okay, had a nice unobstructed view, and we still received our requests of king bed/smoking. The bathroom was large, with a Jacuzzi tub, but we never used it. The employees were very friendly, going out of their way to say good morning and chitchat a bit. I have no complaints about the staff and housekeeping.The thing that I really did not care for, was how the hotel nickel and dimes its customers. I already mentioned the coffee maker, which annoyed me a little, but when we checked in they told us about the amenities/stocked refrigerator in the room. They said that everything is scanned, and even if you just pick something up and look at it, your room will be charged. Needless to say, we steered way away from all of these items for fear of knocking something down! I read this before on one of the reviews, but still, it was a bit disconcerting. They also charge per day to use the gym, but with all of the walking we did, the gym was not needed. Hotel Internet was also charged by the day, but my BF has an air card, so we did not need to purchase this. Since we did not pay for the room, I shouldnt complain about the extra charges. But had we paid regular price for the room, I would not have been happy at all!Both my BF and I did not care for the Casino at this hotel. It seems there are two areas for gambling, one area was mainly tables with some slot machines placed around, and the other area was the slot machine area. Neither my BF nor I play the table games; we play the slots and my BFs favorite is Keno. But at Caesars, they did not have the Keno machine he likes, so we spent most of our time out of the hotel. There was something about the layout neither one of us liked, and when I spoke to other people, they also felt the same. We spent a lot of time at Bills, which was right across the street. Kind of a locals type of place in the middle of the strip, and fun. For all the time we spent there, I only saw Big Elvis show once, at its tail end, but I think I would have really enjoyed seeing the whole thing. It was quite entertaining! The 99 cent Margaritas were pretty good too! Even though I picked this hotel for its pool area, we did not use it at all. In fact, we didnt even look at it! I read that part of the pool area was under construction. With that in mind, coupled with the occupancy at the hotel, I thought the pool area would be wall-to-wall people, and not very relaxing. But Vegas is not a place to relax! We were on the go constantly, and it was a good thing I brought comfortable walking shoes.I think the best thing about the hotel was the location. It was centrally located between the Bellagio, and the Mirage. The Forum Shops are connected, although we never walked through them. We rented a car, but hardly used it. I dont think we would get a car next time, unless we leave the city. The traffic was terrible; I think I could walk to most places faster. The last day we planned to go to the Lake Mead area, but found out that same day President Obama was staying at our hotel, which made for an even more chaotic atmosphere, and decided not to give up our prime parking spot. It must have been fate that we couldnt go, because my BF won the jackpot at Keno at the Bellagio!One day we drove to Fremont Street (the old Las Vegas), and I loved it! They are celebrating Summer of Love, the 60s. Blood, Sweat and Tears played during the afternoon, and they will have other relatively well known bands from the 60s playing there throughout the summer. They also had another band playing 60s rock, along with a jazz musician, and probably others that I missed. The light show was spectacular! I couldnt describe it, but it was of course 60s themed, and made the visit to Fremont worth the trip. That, and the 99 cent shrimp cocktails we had for lunch at one of the casinos.All in all, we had a really good time in Vegas. I did a lot of research, thanks to everyones input on Trip Advisor, so we were prepared with a list of things to do and see. We didnt have the time to do and see everything, and at times I felt I was on sensory overload, with only 5-6 hours of sleep. Im glad it was just my BF and me, because I think with more people, it would be too confusing, trying to coordinate times and desires. We spent about 4 full days there, and probably another day would have been good for us, being that it was our first trip. I guess we will have to plan another trip for next year!"
208,303,"Jun 18 2009 	Worth staying there if only for the spa and location.	We just back from our first trip to Vegas. This is a beautiful hotel, but the service could be better. After we had waited in a very long line to check in, one desk clerk beckoned us to her station, only to walk away. So we were just standing there - there were a few guys in suits walking around behind the desk, not doing anything - certainly not offering to help. When someone finally did help us, they told us our room wasn't ready, but they had some upgrades available for an extra cost (of course). I wish we had taken her up on that, but I'll get to that later. Anyway, she wouldn't even pre-register us. We had to drop off our bags at the bell stand, then 45 minutes later, go stand in the long line again.The room (in the Roman Tower) was a good size, but a little tired. The white tile in the bathroom needs replacing, or at least the grout needs to be bleached. The carpet was coming loose at the edges in several places. The hairdryer in the room may as well have been someone with emphysema blowing on my hair, for all the power it had. And the shower - only a small soapdish for shelving. I had to put shampoo, conditioner, razor on the floor.The breakfast buffet at Cafe Lago was disappointing. Definitely go across to the Bellagio or Paris for their buffet.Casino: the dealers - except for the girls in the Pussycat Dolls casino, looked and acted miserable.Pool: lots of construction going on, but that didn't really affect our experience there. Other things did, though: very slow service at the pool bar- they seemed to be understaffed. We had a very hard time finding lounge chairs. We could have spent God-knows-how-much on a sunbed or cabana, but we were on a budget. We ended up finding two chairs that were not even next to each other. That wouldn't have bothered me so much, except for the fact that no one ever asked us for our name, room key, or anything to prove we were hotel guests. I wonder how many of the people taking up the lounge chairs had no business being there in the first place.Spa: The only reason I'd go back to this hotel. Qua Baths and Spa is amazing! Impeccable service, gorgeous facility. Be sure to take your bathing suit if you're modest, though. The amazing whirpool baths are bathing-suit optional. I enjoyed the herbal steam room, followed by the arctic ice room. Greg gave me the best massage I've ever had. He really understood what kind of pressure I needed, and where I needed the most work. Awesome. Ask for him!Another cool thing is all the toiletries they provide for your after-treatment freshening up. All you need to bring is your make-up - they have everything else.Cool spa gift shop, too - with reasonably priced merchandise.All in all, the spa and the location keep this from being a bad review. We chose Caesars because if its central location on the Strip, and that definitely made a difference for us."
209,303,"Jun 18 2009 	Beware of the construction around the pools!!!!	Great hotel, I mean, c'mon it's Caesar's Palace!! Everything, food, casino, location, atmosphere) was awesome. There was some amusement when I checked in. I reserved a room on the high floor in the Forum Tower, (I used the hotel's website). Upon checking in the rather chipper young man said our room was ready to go, a &quot;smoking&quot; room on a lower floor. I told him I didn't make a reservation for that type of room and with a few clicks of the keyboard he gave us a room in the Palace Tower. He described it was a &quot;mini suite.&quot; Which was basically code for &quot;this is a regular room, so take it.&quot; Up we go to the room, and it was nice, bathrooms are great and it looked newly renovated. Nice view of the pool and all that surrounding construction. Here's the thing that really got me... I could hear the construction get underway, everyday at 5am sharp. Huge earth movers, air horns, beeping noises, etc. It was all clear as a bell. Once we got down to the pool area, which is very nice, we battled more noise, banging, rouge debris flying about, and dust. The construction even drowned out the killer music casinos play poolside. Oh, and this was my favorite, there were tiny pieces of styrafoam blown into the pools from the construction side. The little white pieces would form this huge mass, like something out of a movie, into a snake like creature and circle the pool. It reminded me of Red Tide scenario.Bottom line, hotel = great. Pool area = terrible. Once pool area is done in &quot;summer of 2009&quot; = I'm sure it'll be awesome. Until then, stay somewhere else other than Caesar's. You'll be in for a big disappointment, if you want to relax at the pool."
210,303,"Jun 18 2009 	Incredible experience in a Palace Deluxe room	I had a great experience staying on a Hotwire-booked trip at Caesar's. I arrived at check-in around 1:30. I was told the official check-in time had not begun, but the woman at the front desk said she was able to find a room for me. She did not mention Hotwire, and gave me my key and directed me toward the Palace Tower.I was very pleasantly surprised to see I had been given a Palace Deluxe room. The room is very spacious for a non-suite, I would guess around 550 sq ft. The king-size bed I requested was very comfortable. A lounge chair and couch are provided, and they really add some comfort to the room. The desk is where I worked on my computer the little I had to, and it has a beautiful oval mirror above it. High-speed internet is $13, no surprise, and they do not offer wireless internet, at least in the Palace Tower. The television in the room is adequate, though I would have expected a bit more. It's a 26-inch LCD tv that did not display HD channels. The channel selection was good.The bathroom is incredible. A giant square mirror rests over two golden sinks, with a beautiful and deep tub to the right. There is a separate shower area which I appreciated, and the toilet is in a small room by itself. No tv in the bathroom. The bathroom's marble floors were the best part.The view from my window was of the incredible pool area below. Unfortunately, the pool was currently under construction so I had a good view of that. However, under normal circumstances, the view from my room would be superb, and I still enjoyed it myself. One negative thing about the room I can say is that it is not well lit, even during the daytime. I had all the lights and lamps on, and the blinds on the window fully open, and it was still rather dark in my room. This is pretty typical of many hotel rooms, but it's something I always notice.There is a fully-stocked minibar that, not surprisingly, is very expensive. There are also some chocolates, snacks, and beauty kits that you can take from the room, which are very expensive as well. A fair warning - I picked up several of these snacks and items to examine the contents. I discovered at check-out that there are sensors where the items are kept to tell the hotel what you have taken. Even though I am confident I put everything back in its place, upon checkout my bill showed two of the items. I told them I had not taken them from the room and they promptly removed them from the bill.The casino at Caesar's is very good. I do not play many slots, but prefer poker, and Caesar's has one of the best poker rooms on the strip, if not the best. They have a pretty good selection of high- and low-level games throughout the casino, though I had some trouble finding a blackjack game during the middle of the day that wasn't a $25 minimum. As stated before, I had the minor problem at checkout, but other than that it was fine. The lines were short for me both checking in and out, and even during a peak check-in time (around 4:30) I only saw a line of about four people.I was very pleased with Caesar's, especially the room I got for the price I paid. I would gladly stay there again. It is a cut above the other 4-star hotels on the strip."
211,303,"Jun 16 2009 	Ceasar's is disappointing in comparison to same or lower priced hotels	I just returned from Ceasar's Palace with a group of guys down in Vegas for a bachelor party. We were not traveling on a budget and frankly, without our women, we were more tolerant to problems. Here is honest balanced feedback of the hotel (can't stand people that find no positives):Check-in: Horrible. We arrived on Thursday night at 10PM and still waited 35 minutes due to the fact that there were only 3 people at the front desk. As well, we were told that there were tons of rooms with King sized beds available, but none with two beds. After ten minutes of explaining that non-gay guys on a bachelor party don't want to sleep with each other, we were told that there were some rooms that were vacant, and a rush could be put on them with housekeeping. Why would they not try to clean rooms with two beds earlier in the day to make them available? Anyway, we were told would need to come back in 2 hours. When we did, we had to wait another 25 minutes in the VIP line. The guys ahead of of in line were completely upset about the room they had been given and the guy behind us told us that he was livid with what he had been given. This validated for us that numerous people were having difficulty. On a positive note, check-out was a breeze, however the hotel was completely inflexible on having a late checkout....on a sunday! hahaRooms:Huge disappointment. We were given 3 rooms in the Roman Tower and they were 3 star quality. The beds and furniture were old and tired (the pictures on their website were definitely airbrushed to perfection as the reality is much different when you walk in the room). The bathroom would have been comparable to that of a motel.....and the clothes closet was located within the bathroom (have never seen this before). There were no minibar/fridges in the rooms. There really was no view of the strip from any of the rooms. Instead, we were staring at a bunch of pipes and maintenance buildings.Pool:Horrible. Not even close to enough pool lounge chairs for the size of the hotel. We had to grab single chairs from all over and start grouping them together in one location, but pool security got upset at that. When we told them that their lack of lounge chairs was ridiculous, they backed off and said they would allow it. There were hundreds of people that had no chairs and left the pool area frustrated or sat on the cement. On our second day, we decided to pay $30 each to go into the &quot;Venus&quot; adult pool area and avoid the deck chair hassle. Unbelievably, we got in there and there were no deck chairs at all. Basically, they wanted us to pay $1000 for a private cabana or sit on the cement on the edge of the pool. Shouldn't a $30/person pool entry fee implicitly mean that you would get a simple pool chair? Ridiculous! We ended up exiting the Venus pool to once again move a bunch of single chairs by the main pool and lost the $30/each.Location:Only good aspect of the hotel. It is right in the middle of the strip and there is some great shopping (The Forum Shops) attached to it.Service:Pool bar service was horrible. I felt bad for the waitresses because they were doing their best, but there was only two of them that we could see serving the entire pool of hundreds. We ordered large margaritas ($20 each) on the first day and it took 45 minutes for them to get to us. The lobby restaurant was poor as well. We went there for breakfast on the last morning. We were given our drinks and then it took them 20 minutes to come and take the rest of our order.Sidenotes:The Casino was fine, but you need to be ready to play higher wager tables. We ran into a few Vegas regular gamblers who were staying at other hotels and gambling at Ceasar's. We asked them why and they told us that Ceasar's used to be a great hotel, but since their new management took over they have let the hotel spiral downwards and become chincy. We couldn't have agreed more.All in all, you can get comparable prices for other hotels like MGM Grand, The Hotel @ Mandalay Bay, The Mirage....and fairly close prices for The Bellagio, The Venetian, Planet Hollywood, etc. The majority of us have previously stayed in Las Vegas at all of these hotels. Even The Luxor rooms are better than what you get at Ceasar's. TAKE MY ADVICE and stay at a comparably priced hotel that will have nicer rooms, a better pool, and better service."
212,303,Jun 15 2009 	Caesars Palace was Perfect	First time to Las Vegas for my wife and I. We stayed four nights in the Palace Tower and had a great trip! The room was very comfortable with a jacuzzi tub and shower. Loved the Pool! I would have preferred it if the construction around the pool were finished but it didn't damper our enjoyment of the facilities. I can't wait to go back and see the finished Garden of the Gods Pool Oasis.
213,303,"Jun 14 2009 	Anniversary Stay at Caesars	My husband and I stayed at Caesars for the second time earlier this week. We had a room in the Augustus Tower with a great view over looking the Bellagio fountains on the 33rd floor. Overall the room was great: big bathroom with a tv, spa tub, walk in shower, closet, mini bar, comfortable beds, etc. There were a few spots in the room that were stained. Location was great, very close to everything we wanted to do. Free entry into Pure nightclub (worth it to avoid the huge line). We would stay again."
214,303,"Jun 13 2009 	Disappointed Customer Satisfaction	Just got back from Ceaser's Palace. I was not expecting the &quot;less than expected&quot; treatment. I was surprised that in this time of economic turmoil that one would &quot;exceed customer expectation&quot; considering 'Customers&quot; are the reason they are employed. I stayed in late and requested housekeeping to turn my room and replenish it with new towels and sheets. I left for 1 hour and a half and I tried to come back to my room. My room card will not let me in. I had to walk back to the hotel registration desk and wait in a lengthy line just to &quot;re-code&quot; my card (20 minutes). I was irritated at that point. The desk clerk was dry, inhospitable and looked like he hated his job, no dialogue. After WAITING in line, I went back to my room, (which is in the Palace Towers, LONG WALK) I get in and my room had not been touched by anyone. I was really irritated now. I phoned for a supervisor, but got an automated system putting me on hold. Did I say I was irritated; I finally got a supervisor to re-tell my experience. They did listen, apologized and gave me a $50 food and beverage comp. Did I mention that youre in Vegas and everything is priced like you were shopping at a luxury retailer. I used the comp and got early breakfast as I was flying out before the sun came up in the am. The food was horrible. My daughter who is a juvenile makes better food, really. The pancakes were dry, overcooked. It had a decent size for the price ($12). The milk ($4) temperature felt like room temperature. My omelet ($15) was pretty normal. It took about 45 minutes to get it. Make sure you get ALL of the finer detail when you check-out. Because I did not use my &quot;Players&quot; card, my room was not comp'ed. I was suppose to spend a minimum of $100 for this, THEY DID NOT TELL ME and would not credit my bill. Oh, .and the Poker room does not count. I went and used my players card and met the minimum requirement, but still no satisfaction. I would suggest anyone staying anywhere else than Ceaser's Palace. Please do not go through this experience that I went through. We work hard for our money and they should too. Vegas is hurting for consumers like us to spend. I don't mind spending, but treat me like you would expect to be treated at the Mecca of gambling. I plan on writing them a letter and telling all what happened to me."
215,303,"Jun 13 2009 	A bit of ancient rome in the middle of Vegas	Once again it was time for me to head out to Vegas for a little relaxation and for this trip I chose to stay at Caesars Palace due to the fabulous rate I received for the Memorial Day holiday weekend. I wasnt expecting it to be too crowded due to all the economic reviews Ive been hearing, but I was sorely mistaken. Valet parking was PACKED when I arrived at 10PM and it was closed to all but Diamond and Seven Star members. I remembered there was valet parking in back by the parking garage and headed back there. No crowds and I zipped right in. The downside is the long walk to registration.When I arrived at the front desk there were only a couple of people ahead of me and it gave me time to figure out if I wanted to give the $20 bribe a shot. I was undecided and I always wonder if Id come off looking like a fool. I waited till the last moment and decided the heck with it. The clerk was real friendly and he informed that as a Platinum member I could have stood in a quicker line (which actually wasnt moving so quickly). As of April 1, 2009 I was no longer a Platinum member and had been busted back down to Gold due to my lack of gambling over the past 15 months. My online Harrahs account has me listed as a Gold member, but my reservation had me pegged as a Platinum member  go figure &lt;shrug&gt;. It all worked to my benefit because he upgraded me to the 25th floor in the Palace Tower. Granted its NOT the nicest tower, but it was close to the pool and I had a half-way decent view of the strip. The walk to the Palace Tower from the front desk is a bit of a hike, but its not too horrible. I arrived at my room and was pleasantly surprised  the room had been recently updated (1+ year or so), decent sized, and the dcor was modern with a touch of class. The rooms most unique feature is its dual marble bathroom, united by a walk-in shower and featuring an oversized spa tub. The room was clean upon my arrival and throughout my stay. The room came with the following amenities: LDC Television, bedside clock radio with CD player, &amp; MP-3 hook-up, Gilchrest &amp; Soames bath amenities, wet/dry mini bar, 2 waffle weave robes, and an in-room safe. One thing I did want to comment about was the great job the maids did in keeping everything clean because many of the hotel guests did their best to trash the place. Each day the hallway was spotless, but by the next morning people had trashed it. Garbage thrown on the floor, cigarette butts snubbed out on the wall and flicked to the floor, not to mention the amount of empty beer bottles tossed about. People, I realize youre on vacation, but does that mean you have to act like a bunch of slobs???Off my soap boxAs you can see from my pictures, there is a great deal of construction going on around the pool area which was a bit problemsome. I didnt find the noise to be an issue, but the lack of chairs was a problem. Im not sure if this is always an issue, but 15-20 minutes after the pool opened, all the chairs were taken. For the next few hours all you see are people walking around searching for a chair. During my stay, the hotel was extremely rigid in regards to when the pool opened. People were not allowed out into the pool area until 9:00 AM on the dot. Therefore, that meant people started forming a line at 8:30 AM. A word to the wise, forget about grabbing a towel right away. Go grab your chair and then head back to get a towel after most people have gone through the line or otherwise youll miss out on the prime real estate around the pool. Drink service was so so  I chose instead to walk up to the tiki bar and grab a brew rather than waiting for the waitress to come back around. The wait staff was working hard, they just couldn't keep up with all the demand.All in all I had a nice trip and would recommend Caesars Palace to many of my friends. Its centrally located, nice pool area (when the construction is completed), nice restaurant and a large gaming area. Enjoy!!"
216,303,"Jun 12 2009 	Avoid until Building works are completed	May/June 2009 - is was my 4th trip back to Las Vegas.. This hotel was really nice although a bit dated.. This hotel is going through lots of development and will be massive once complete. Towers are being built and this is causing lots of noise and debris to fly around, especially around the pool areas.. I have uploaded 2 pics. Pool 1 was closed a few days due to the windy weather. Pool 2 was open and we ended up getting covered in building debris and grit in mour eyes. I would not recommend staying here until the building works are completed. Once the building works are complete this will probably be one of the best value hotels to stay in the center of the strip.."
217,303,"Jun 11 2009 	Caesars Palace has lost some appeal	We stayed in the deluxe towers. Very beautiful room with a full mini-bar, flat screen TV and a jumbo jet tub. The room had an ok view of the strip, but only from an angle not offering great views. The elevators to the towers were right in front of the pool entrance making it very convenient for swimming on the warm desert days. The next afternoon we visited Caesars Neptune Pool. The main pool offered a stunning circular wading area with many fountains. Unfortunately it was very windy and chilly so swimming was not called for. Another unfortunate event is the construction going on at Caesars. During the week they are rebuilding around the pool. During this time you will be deaf from the loud noises and expect to get flying debris in your eyes, hair, clothing and the numerous amount of it in the pool. So BEWARE! http://www.joreviews.com/travel/las-vegas-june-2009"
218,303,"Jun 10 2009 	Caesars Palace is a great place to stay!	I can't beleive all the whiners expecting something for nothing i.e. upgrades. We've stayed at CP over 30 times, usually checking in at the airport, and have had very few minor problems. When we've had a problem it's been taken care of promptly. A propery the size of CP is going to have it's problems but we always make the best of it and always return!"
219,303,"Jun 9 2009 	didnt want to leave	another great stay in las vegas. first time staying at caesars palace,stayed in the forum tower deluxe room. the room was very nice and clean would stay in the forum tower again. its location is perfect for the sports book and poker room, the pool is a little walk away but not too bad. the pool is still under construction, three pools are open and no problem getting a chair. we ate at the mesa grill one night, wow was that good, we had lamb chops and halibut.the staff was very helpful and friendly. we ate lunch at the buffet 44.00 for two thought this was a pretty good deal if you dont eat breakfast(slept in too much). went to the improv at harrahs, it was worth everypenny laughed all night. a great trip will be back !!!!!"
220,303,"Jun 9 2009	Perfect Location	We stayed in the Augustus Tower, which is an easy uncomplicated walk from the Front Desk, and easy to get to the Strip. Th room itself was exactly as pictured on Caesars website. Cleaning staff was very good, and bellman service was prompt. Eat in the Casino food court, it has a good variety, and it's alot cheaper than the restaurants.Although Caesar's Palace is huge, once you get to know the layout, it is very easy to navigate around. My only complaint is that we had to wait until 5:00 pm for our room to be ready."
221,303,Jun 8 2009 	Beautiful room great security and housekeeping!	We stayed on the 45th floor of the Forum tower from 5/27-6/1/09. Michael checked us in with no wait and was very nice. The room was very clean and housekeeping did a great job of keeping it this way during the whole stay. We noticed security walking our floor during the day and night which made us feel secure. The pools are the best in Vegas and the pool hostesses made sure the guests had lounge chairs. We are Diamond players with Harrahs and we frequent many of their properties throughout the U.S. but the room in the Forum tower is the best. We can't wait to come back to Caesars!
222,303,"Jun 3 2009 	Everything I thought it would be!	Stayed at Caesars Palace in April, booked through Expedia. The only glitch was room wasn't ready, so we stayed in Forum Towers, which was newly remodeled, beautiful rooms. Huge Roman walk-in shower with rainshower sprayer on ceiling AND on wall. Sleek flat screen tv and our luggage was brought up very quickly. Rooms kept immaculately clean, very comfortable bed and short distance from our room to elevators. Just walking around there was amazing and beautiful. Cheesecake Factory in Forum Shops is a must. I highly recommend Caesars Palace!"
223,303,"Jun 3 2009 	excellent location  no free upgrade but did it anyway  view was grrreat	3RD TIME IN VEGAS , CHECK IN WAS GOOD , DECIDED TO UPGRADE AS 3 FEMALES NEED LOTS OF SPACE . THE VIEW OVER THE BELLAGIO FOUNTAINS WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY ! Facilities excellent . location of room (augustus tower great ) would recommend it , bit pricey but got everything we expected for the money. If you want to indulge yourself go to caesars ! vini vidi vici ! Even the president turned up for the night !Grand canyon tour a must do ."
224,303,Jun 3 2009	super stay	enjoyed my stay had a wonderful time staff really helpfull loved the hotel visit this place you will love it
225,303,"May 31 2009 	Great value.	This was our first trip to Vegas. We had booked into the Bellagio for a couple of nights but our room was next to a construction site and we didn't like being woken by jack hammers and noisy reversing vehiles at 5.30 am so decided to stay at Caesars. We got an excellent internet rate and an upgrade when we stayed for 3 nights, check in was prompt and check out easy - we even got to keep our room key as a keepsake. The room was nice and quiet and the only problem we had was finding our way to our room when we left the hotel, the place is enormous. Perhaps the idea is to keep you in the place which would be no hardship as there is so much to do and see. We didn't even get time to use the pools which looked very inviting.We would definately stay here again.VJ Perth Western Australia"
226,303,"May 30 2009 	Fantastic - Part of Family History	I took my mom here. Check in was busy and she asked the floor manager what line should we stand in. Truth be told my grandfather used to gamble there every day. The staff knew him. We were upgraded to a suite. It was wonderful. The only downside is the walking and the buffet. However, we got a comp after explaining. Caesers Palace is Las Vegas and I love staying there. If you want to stay at Wynn or Encore expect &quot;pretty things&quot; but no value."
227,303,"May 30 2009	My stay at Caesar's Palace Las Vegs	CAesar's Palce may be big and Luxury hotel but they forgooten the simple things make people comung back. No shuttle service to other hotels and attractions. You have walk to Harrah's to get a shuttle. They give you directions to Harrah's but the long way to get there. 20 minute walk through the hotel forum shops. You only had to take a 7 minute walk through the main entrance. It seems they want to discourage you from leaving Caesar's. Buffet was a joke for breakfast for 2 at the buffet cost $38 when you can to the Flamingo for $21. I go to Vegas every 4 months. Was looking forward to my stay at Caesar's but was disappointed. If you are a average person go to Rio Suites they treat you great no matter what status you are in VIP,Rich or just an average person who want to have fun. Caesar' Palace SUCKS.Laverne"
228,303,"May 28 2009 	Nice Place	I recently returned to Las Vegas for a business trip, and luckily stayed at Caesar's Palace. Check-in was quick, as I checked-in around 9 pm and there was not a line. The place is huge, so it took a bit to find the elevator bank leading to my room. I stayed in the Forum Tower and had a really nice room. It was pretty big, clean, had a large flat screen Sony TV in the bedroom and a tv built into the bathroom mirror. The A/C worked great, but I didn't have much of a view. I checked out around noon, and there was a 15 minute line. There are several dining options in the hotel. In particular, I ate at Mesa Grill which is reasonably priced and offers very good food. It is actually one of Bobby Flay's restaurants, and he is a renouned chef. Overall, I think this is a nice hotel. It may be a little for expensive than others, but it is worth the money if you want a nice room."
229,303,"May 26 2009	Avoid this hotel -- nothing but problems that the staff refuses to fix	I've been to Vegas hundreds of times. I've been going 2-4 times a year since I was a baby. This was the worst trip I've ever had, and it was all thanks to Caesar's Palace. My family had stayed there before about 4-5 years ago and we decided to stay there again this year b/c of a deal the hotel offered and b/c we wanted to take advantage of their nice pool area.We requested a room next to a family member's room. This was arranged months in advance, but when we got there we got moved from a room in the new, modern Augustus Tower to the completely out-dated, old-fashioned, poorly-furnished, horribly dark and dingy Roman Tower. They said our original room wasn't ready. When we complained we were told we had to pay for an upgrade even though they downgraded us without any notice at all! The room was facing another tower, the beds were smaller than any beds I slept in in European budget hotels (European hotels have smaller beds than American hotels, I have learned. Caesar's is the exception.) There was ZERO sunlight that entered the room, despite it being the beginning of a sunny, hot Vegas summer. There was only one light in the room and it took a lot of work to get it to function. The bathroom was remodeled, but only one of its 3 lights were functioning, making it very difficult to get ready in there. Everything was dirty, dark, and dingy. I should also mention at check-in that they said we had an envelope at another desk, but that desk said they didn't and treated us like we were crazy for asking. Two hours before checking out, we get a phone call that they had a gift card waiting for us. The gift card was for the hotel so we couldn't even use it! And it was a gift from a friend. What a waste!We tried getting out of the room and hanging out by the pool, but half the seats are reserved (pool guy told me you need to spend a half million before they can reserve seats for you). The pool chairs are all stacked in tight rows so you can't distance yourself from any other groups. This isn't a problem though since it's impossible to find any seats together. I got 4 seats b/c i went really early, but when I got out of the water I found that the pool guys had given my chairs to another group of people even though I had a beach bag, clothes, hats, magazines, and sunscreen covering them. Also, there was construction, and dust and debris got in the water and on my bathing suit. So now the room stunk and the pool stunk, so we went to the casino which was virtually empty. The lounges are all very dull and the only one that ever gets a crowd is the Shadow Bar. However, this may only be because it's so small 10 people constitute a crowd. There's no live music or any other kind of entertainment to enjoy while you drink or gamble. Also, the waitresses that worked the casino were very slow. I attribute this to the fact that they were understaffed and had to much ground to cover to work speedily and efficiently.The bellmen also were very slow. We waited over 30 min for one when we were checking out. They were severely understaffed, leading to delays and REALLY long lines at the bell desk.Also, don't expect extra towels, toiletries, or anything else because even if you request them and they say they'll send someone up they never do.Please avoid Caesar's Palace. It has gone down hill, the staff at the check-in/check-out desks are rude and unhelpful, and all the other areas of the hotel are understaffed. Instead, stay at Paris, Las Vegas. The rooms are much nicer, and if you don't get a remodeled room, the older rooms are a million times better than those at Caesar's.Caesar's will never see me or any of my friends and family again."
230,303,"May 22 2009 	We were very satisfied	My husband and I were in Las Vegas last weekend for the Buffet concert. We chose to stay at Caesars because we got a great price with US Airways through Costco. After reading other reviews I was prepared to do what I had to do to get an upgrade out of the Roman Tower. To my surprise our room was in the Palace Tower, which proved to a great location. Since it was so hot, we took advantage of the pool and this is the closest tower to the pool. Our room was clean, quiet and we had no problem with any employees. The location was perfect, as we were right across the street from Margaritavile and it was easy to get the monarail at the Flamingo."
231,303,"May 22 2009	Caesar's Palace Las Vegas May 2009	We had a mixed experience with Caesar's during a visit from May 9-13th. We were making out first trip to Caesars (we usually stay at MGM Grand) and were there to celebrate our 25th anniversary. I checked many postings here before we left and was concerned about the situation at the pool and the construction. They had two pools open but for our intents only one since the other was &quot;european&quot; (topless). The pool was very crowded since it was the only one for the hotel, but worse than that was the construction that surrounded the pool on 2 of 4 sides. The noise and unsightly view lowered the satisfaction of the pool time a great deal. It was just plain ugly to look at.In addition we were hoping for the nice upgrade offers that we had read about, especially in light of it being our anniversary. We had notified the hotel ahead of time of this fact. There were three couples in our party (all arriving seperately). One couple got a free upgrade with little effort at all (and no tip required). The second got an upgrade for $40 a night. We were offered an upgrade (with a tip) for $50 a night. We declined their offer. This left a bad taste in our mouth. The people working the casino were very nice for the most part, and the store employees were very nice and helpful. The front desk just took away all the good will of the others.We will not go back to Caesars. Next stop, either back to MGM or maybe try the Mirage. Caesar's, not so much......"
232,303,"May 22 2009 	Enjoyed our stay here very much	This is now the third time that we have stayed in Caesars Palace so you can see that we do like it. I feel that I should now give feedback to counteract some of the negative comments that others have left (although I do not dispute that they received poor service.) We booked the room through an online booking agency and the voucher said that the room would be 'allocated on arrival'. When we arrived I asked how much it would cost for an upgrade as I wanted to stay in the Palace Tower (where we had stayed the last time). The receptionist said that the room we had been allocated was in that tower anyway! I felt that we got a fantastic deal - the room had 2 interconnecting bathrooms, was beautifully furnished and was spotlessly clean. The hotel is big and impersonal but so are many of the other hotels in Las Vegas. The situation in the middle of the strip is excellent and you are within walking distance of many of the other large hotels. We also toured around Arizona and for our last night returned to Las Vegas as we were flying out the following morning. This time I booked on the Caesars Palace website and got a deal for a hotel room and 2 tickets for Elton John. This time the room was in the newly refurbished Forum Tower and it was very nice as well, although I still prefer the Palace Tower. This room was convenient for the show as it is just across the Forum Casino from the theatre. Would I stay here again if I went to Las Vegas? Yes - I personally have always found it to be very good value with lovely accommodation. The only disappointment was that the swimming pools closed early so don't leave it too late if you want to go for a swim!!"
233,303,"May 21 2009 	gone downhill. stay away	We stayed for 3 nights at Caesars. Having stayed there many times before and always had good service, it became clear that they have gone very far downhill. The room was filthy. The bedding was dirty, the couch full of stains and looked like it was 30 years old. The carpet wasn't even vacuumed. There was food and nuts laying on the carpet. The aircon was unbearably noisy. We switched room when I complained about the filth and aircon. The new room was marginally better, but the bedding and furniture was still dirty (I got extra blankets to sit on the couch as it looked terrible). Then it got worse. The aircon was blowing smoke into the room at night so it was like sleeping in a nightclub. The plumbing was leaking in the bathroom and getting worse. We called 3 times with no one coming to fix it after many promises. Eventually, I told housekeeping that we had to leave to a show but that they should sort it out as it was now running onto the carpet. They assured us they would sort it out asap. When we came back to the room about 4 hours later, the whole carpet was flooded and the outside corridor was also flooded. They did however fix the plumbing. They simply left towels on the carpet in the room which were by then sopping wet. They didn't bother to move us or even make the offer to move us. I mean come on, how can you leave the room looking like that when your plumbing is busted. We checked out the next day. When we complained - they apologised only when I asked for someone that was more senior but did nothing to make up for it. Never ever heard from them since although they requested all our details. There are much better hotels in Vegas for the same price. Generally, barring the chambermaids, the staff at the hotel were arrogant and very unhelpful. I travel a lot to some crappy places around the world and to be honest have never ever come across such bad service as at this hotel on this experience. This hotel has become an embarassment. Stay away."
234,303,"May 21 2009 	Great room amazing service	We stayed five nights in the Augustus Tower. The room was large, maid service prompt and the bathroom especially gorgeous. The best part, however, came after we left. We were just getting ready to board our plane when we discovered that we'd forgotten to pack stuff, mostly clothing, left in a nightstand, some of which would have been hard to replace. Called Caesar's minutes before takeoff, security immediately sent someone up to our room, confirmed to us that our stuff was safe and would be Fed Ex'd the same day. And it was. From the initial phone call, all this took place in a matter of four minutes as we boarded the plane. We're not high rollers, but with that kind of service, we felt like ones."
235,303,"May 20 2009 	DISAPPOINTED	A huge and magnificantly decorated property, but not the world-reknowned resort I was anticipating. The service and cleanliness were mediocre. All pools are open but construction continues overhead of two pools. The lounges around the topless pool were fantastic, but having to pay an entrance fee as a guest was not appreciated, and the loud hardcore rap music prevented relaxation. Finding our way around was a chore since no decent property map was provided and getting help was difficult. Not worth the weekend pricing, but a great deal for weeknights. Other resorts such as the Mirage or Venetian may actually provide a more pleasurable experience."
236,303,"May 19 2009 	Thoroughly enjoyed the experience!	Took advantage of a 4-night comp w/2 tix to see Elton John. Brought my 16-year old. Had a &quot;standard&quot; room upon check in. Paid to upgrade to Augustus tower for $60/night. Room itself was quite nice,clean, well appointed w/great view of Bellagio Fountains below. Would have been nicer if the windows were clean. Bathroom was swank, w/jacuzzi tub and TV. Kid loved that! The only faulty issue was w/the glass-walled shower. Water kept leaking at the bottom of the foundation, leave over an inch of water. Kid went skidding across the bathroom! Maintenance tried several times to fix, but the problem persisted throughout the stay. Asked for a fridge. After it didn't arrive 3 hours later, called back to cancel. Didn't see any point in paying for it. However, they brought one in the next day, comp'd. Had also called for dry-cleaning pickup that never arrived. Front desk staff very pleasant. Had a great meal at the Noodle Restaurant. However, if you dine at the cafe in the main lobby, don't go for the surf 'n turf as I had to send mine back. I've had leather shoes softer than the steak! Valet was fine until Friday, where it turned into a madhouse...and only Platinum Rewards members could use it then. Slots are not as loose as Flamingo's. Concert was frikkin AMAZING...with two of the best seats in the house! Returning to Vegas in July, but still on the fence about where to stay. Caesar's is a sure bet...but have thought about trying out the other Harrah properties."
237,303,"May 19 2009 	Gone down hill	I have stayed here several times before and have always felt it was about average for what they charge. It is an older property so its age is evident in many places. This time was one disaster after another. First we reserved this six months in advance as I was a speaker at a conference being held in the hotel. They immediatly charged my room when we placed the reservation as I recieved a receipt--that was alittle strange since normally it is a reservation and not a room purchase. Any way, several months later my bookkeeper notifies me we have another charge for the same room. They had charged twice. I had my staff get with them and finally we were ablke to get a credit issued before I arrived at the hotel. I had a long drive from a client location in California to Las Vegas so I get in at 10. My staff had reassured me it was a non-smoking king which is what they always order. After going through the pain of crossing through the casino to register (what a hassle but normal in these hotels) I get my key and we head back across the casino to the room in one of the towers. As soon as I open the room I could smell the stench of cigarette smoke. We wlak in and it looks like someone had laid on the bed and there were three cigarette butts in an ash tray. We were in a smoking room that was dirty (someone had removed all the amenities in the bathroom) so they must have come up after the room was cleaned and conducted their business on the phone while chain smoking and took all the amenities on their way out. We called the front desk. We were placed on hold for the longest period of time. They told us they would have someone look into it and call us back. Half an hour later we are still sitting in that stinking room. We call again--and again placed on hold. Finally we are able to speak to a human and they said they had no more available non-smoking rooms. We insisted. They finally found one in a different tower. They instructed us to meet someone over there. When we arrived we were surprised that the guard arrived only minutes after we did since we had expected to wait forever. He said he could let us in but had no keys for us and told us we would have to go all the way back to the front desk to get our keys. What a disappointment but it was now becoming par for this experience. We head into our room which was clean. We wanted to order two ice teas and a piece of cake since we had now been there for an hour. When we called, room service told us it would be another hour before they could have the two teas and piece of cake delivered--see a pattern here. It finally showed up and we got to bed around moidnight with the hopes the next day would be better. I called my staff the next day and told them of the situation and fiasco. My travel coordinator told me he was on the phone with the management and they would send up two keys. I decied to order room service. I was told it would take an hour and a half. Surprised??? Now what--do I wait a long time for my meal or a long time for my keys to be delivered. Finally my coordinator was able to reach someone at Caesars that seemed to care. They gave me a complaint number to dial. She apologized and comped the room. I stressed the poor service and slow service as a systemic issue. Apparently the slow room service is a staffing issue but I believe it, along with the other issues here, reflects poorly on Caesars Palace.."
238,303,"May 19 2009	Not cheap but worth it	Huge, huge, huge! Everything is big! the hotel is really nice and my room was big and super comfortable with a jacuzzi, overlooking the strip. It wasn't cheap but for one night it's perfect!"
239,303,"May 17 2009 	perfect again	I recently spent eight days at Caesars. Everything was perfect from the room which overlooked the Bellagio fountains to the service from all aspects of the resort. The Qua spa was wonderful, as were all meals from the restaurant to room service. Cher put on an incredible show. The pools were great. Service inside the casino was wonderful, never having to wait long for cocktail service. My advice to those who complain on this sight, try complaining to a casino host or management when you are physically at the resort. I have stayed at all the major resorts on the strip and Caesars is still the best."
240,303,"May 16 2009 	Bring your walking shoes!	First stay at Caesars' and the only real complaint was the long walks we had and the price of the food.Check in/out was seamless, room was as booked in the Forum Tower. The room was clean with all the amenities as described on the web site. Plasma TV, electronic drapes, TV in the mirror of the bathroom, very comfy bed and high quality linens and more!Housekeeping was very good.The cost of food, even the food court food was expensive. No evening buffet but that is Probably okay because the breakfast and lunch was over priced I thought. We ended up crossing over to Harrahs for our meals. (Not a short hike)Be prepared to walk! The floor plan was confusing. No real short or direct walks from the Forum tower room to the other parts of the property, especially the front of the hotel. Crossing the street was not as easy as it would appear.The Forum shops were very close to the room.A lot of club goers lined up at the clubs each night making it a lively atmosphere.Except for the costly food and the lonnnng walks I liked the resort."
241,303,"May 15 2009 	Disappointed	I've stayed at Caesar's before and I've always had a decent experience, at least no memorable complaints. A group of 14 of us stayed there last month for a bachelorette party and we just could not believe the terrible service we received. To preface--the bachelorette's mother did the booking and is a regular Caesar's visitor. Upon check-in (at the player's club VIP check-in nonetheless) she was told they were completely booked and the 3 rooms for our party (mom and friend had their own) would be spread out on several floors, unacceptable for a reservation made weeks before. An hour later (at 11p) they finally figured out they could get us a suite in the older tower with 3 rooms adjoining. However the adjoining rooms only had 1 king bed each so we needed 4-5 rollaways to sleep the remaining girls (12 total). Fine, actually it was quite nice when we got there, if a little cheesy. It was definitely older but it had a bar setup and extra bathrooms, which was great for the number of females in close quarters. We were easily satisfied and got to partying. None of the keys worked for the adjoining rooms (the suite itself was really just a massive living room/bar, no beds).A while later &quot;Charles&quot; showed up with our rollaways, 2 of them! We told him we needed several more, AND we needed someone to open up the adjoining rooms. He was very rude, told us he couldn't bring more and couldn't open the rooms. Mind you we'd been there over an hour already and had made the call for service right when we got there. After some coaxing we got him to bring a few more rollaways and open the rooms, when one of our nicer friends went to thank him--was actually even going to tip him after that service!--he walked off in a huff and say &quot;yeah whatever&quot;. That was probably the worst of the service we got all weekend, but it was within several hours of arrival so we were even more keen to the crappy stuff that went on the rest of the weekend.Our room was never cleaned unless we asked--we literally had to ask for them to bring up more toilet paper after no one showed up to the room for the first 36 hours and the bathrooms/rooms/suite itself were never actually cleaned, just new towels and toiletries brought. They never got rid of the room service carts, at one point we wheeled out a dirty cart into the hall because we didn't want to see/smell the old food anymore and it sat in the hall in front of our door for 24 hours! Oh, and I had a burnt/tasteless burger at Augustus Cafe that was one of the worst burgers I've ever had, let alone it was $18! I am far from a food complainer, I eat everything and it's especially hard to screw up a burger but it was literally flavorless meat, charred to a crisp (the edges were actually shriveled hard and black).One highlight, we got the BEST server ever at the sushi place, Hyakumi, on our last dinner. She remembered everyone's name in a party of 10, was super helpful, sweet and attentive. We wrote her a glowing comment card (and big tip) but when we asked to speak to the manager to tell her how amazing our server was, she said she was busy and would be right with us...and continued to walk back and forth in front of us several more times saying &quot;just a minute&quot;, we finally just left after we realized she probably wasn't going to stop. Maybe if the managerial staff at Caesar's spent just a little more time praising good work, the staff would have more motivation to actually BE good.Overall, I know our collective bad experiences were probably just unfortunate conicidences judging by all the other comments--and like I said I've stayed before and they were pretty okay (I'm really not just a complainer, I mainly just write good reviews on here). But for the price you pay, and all the other great choices in Vegas, you would hope they would go that extra mile."
242,303,"May 15 2009 	Excellent Hotel + free Upgrade!	Ceasar's Palace: We were there on a comped room, however, we simply asked the person at check-in if there was an opportunity to upgrade and we were upgraded for free to a suite in the forum towers on the 68th floor - very nice room and bathroom, only problem, is there is no window - where there should be a window was a mirror....weird...but we got used to it! I absolutlely loved CP, I typically stay at the palazzo or venetian when i travel to LV for work, but I would def stay at CP again. Also very good food choices here as well.. The pool area is under construction, but the main pool is open and the sign said construction would be completed in summer 2009 - not sure if that will be on track or not. We did have to arrive at the pool at 9am when it opened to reserve chairs, after reserving our chairs we grabbed breakfast and returned to the pool.Night Clubs: We went to PURE, Poetry, and the Christian Audieger club at TI while we were there, we got tons of passes for other places, but were really worn out after the pool, sightseeing, etc each day.Buffets: We went to the TI buffet one night and to the Mirage another night - I like the Mirage the best, but discovered that I really don't eat enough food to make the buffet worth my $$. The best meal I had was a late night meal at Augustus Cafe in CP - steak and crab legs for $28 bucks - just enough.La Reve: Absolutely loved it. Was not sold out at all. We sat in the splash zone and would do it again - maybe about 10 water drops hit us. was great to make eye contact with the performers. I have seen O and Love as well. I like O better, but La Reve was definitely worth seeing as well.Slots: I hit for $300 on the Reel Winners penny slot in CP and also saw someone hit for $2500 on a penny slot in CP - not much luck other than that, a few bucks here and there with black jack...Wax Musuem - visited this for the 1st time and was really impressed. also they had a 1/2 off admission for mom's on mother's day, i thought that was nice. great photo ops with the celebs!"
243,303,"May 13 2009 	GREAT	My husband and I stayed at Caesars from 4/26 to 5/1/09 and renewed our 25th wedding vows in the Garden. Melissa the wedding planner was outstanding, the salon and spa, meeet my expatations. We have stayed at numerous Harrah's property and have not been disapointed with any except the IP. We had another couple who came with us and just loved Caesars. The trip was out of this world. I recommend Caesars to all."
244,303,May 12 2009 	Fell short	We stayed here for 7 nights in May. We found the location was good and central and the rooms were very nice. The bathroom is to die for. We found it a bit dirty in the bathroom upon arrival. For service we found the cleaning staffer who we had very very good and accommodating. We found it was a toss up elsewhere on the staff you got. Be careful on checking in about upgrading your room; we were told our requests were not available unless we upgraded. We went back to a different person and she said it was available with no upgrade. Some wait staff were excellent like on our last day at Augustus but we were there at a different time on Tuesday and we found him rude. We found the bell staff and valet service very good. Overall I think Caesar's is beautiful but I think that the service should be consistent throughout the hotel.
245,303,May 12 2009 	wonderful everytime we stay here	Ceasers is the best hotel in vegas.we haved stayed several different places and Ceasers is by far the best.staff great.restraunts great.the only bad dining experiance we have ever had is at Raos.We have been here three times in the last year and it gets better every time we go.
246,303,"May 11 2009 	Caesars is average	Stayed in Caesars, found it great location but quite tacky compared to the Bellagio which we stayed in afterwards. The rooms were ok, pool was being extended so we had a view of the bulding work and the tiny pool (as most of the grounds were blocked off for the building). Caesars Shops were excellent and great location for the Bellagio and the Venitian so plenty to do. It was good but if you can afford it, choose the Bellagio over it anytime!."
247,303,"May 9 2009 	great trip	stayed from april 30 to may 5. We had a nice room in the augustus tower with king bed and hot tub double sinks and a great view of the belliago fountains ballys and planet hollywood.Room was comped and very clean, maid service was excellent and we won about five thousand on dollar video poker. We would stay here again in a heart beat"
248,303,"May 2 2009 	Good Hotel be prepared to walk	This is a huge complex. Be ready to walk. It takes 10 minutes just to walk from the froint desk to your room! Nice pool, good mix of food options. It is in the middle of the strip, so you can access other properties fairly easily. Nice rooms (ours had a jacuzzi), big bathrooms, nice rooms. Never went to the casino, or went to a show here. Staff is OK, but they get a workout with people asking questions."
249,303,"May 1 2009 	GOOD BUT NOT GREAT	Stayed at Caesars for our 25th wedding anniversary. Stayed 10 nights. Our 3rd visit to VEGASWeather was fab &amp; we did spend a few hours each day by the pool. Plenty of sunbeds but gets very busy &amp; people wander off &amp; leave towels on the sunbeds instead of putting them in the towel drop bins. The pool hosts do a good job of tidying up though &amp; a few mins wait you can get a bed. Lots of construction going on round the pool.Booked through Expidia who were brilliant, great price &amp; Nectar points too &amp; 40$ resort credit on arrival too ! We upgraded our room on arrival at a huge discount (or so they say) as we had been given some money at our anniversary party. Great room in the Palace tower, huge Jacuzzi bath. &amp; nice view. Had wanted to stay at The Bellagio but the price was beyond us.Bit dissapointed that despite us telling everyone at every oppertunity it was our 25th anniversary got no special treatment, didn't feel special &amp; wanted to.The disadvantage of staying at a BIG hotel is that you are just a room number it is all very impersonal. We have stayed at a smaller hotel off strip 4 yrs ago &amp; it was much nicer really. Definatly save our money &amp; go for a smaller one next time.We saved loads of money on shows by looking at the discount booths &amp; taking time to look at the money off vouchers in free booklets everywhere saw 7 shows !Time share touts are everywhere, but we went on one &amp; got 2 free show tickects &amp; 2 buffet tickets too worth well over $100 &amp; breakfast at the info morning which only lasted 90 mins &amp; was very interesting...... NO WE DID NOT BUY !Make sure you take a kettle &amp; tea stuff if like us you like a morning cuppa &amp; ask for a fridge in the room to keep your water etc cold no charge for this.Had a parcel delivered to us during our stay &amp; they charged us $5 for the privalage !The worst bit was walking through the clouds of smoke as they still can smoke indoors in Vegas. Though the hotel is kept very clean &amp; staff get you anything you need quickley with no fuss.Did a sky dive &amp; hrose riding through the red rock canyon both very good days out."
250,303,"Apr 26 2009 	Terrible place for business and exercise	I came here for business. I care nothing for the casino or the shows.Caesars Palace has very few of the amenities you would normally see in a business hotel.1. There is no desk or table in the room to work from.2. There is no in-room coffee.3. The gym is only open from 6 am to 8 pm. My conference lasts roughly from 8 am to 6 pm every day. After the conference, you have to traverse the enromous hotel to your room, change clothes, then traverse it again to go to the gym. Then you're lucky if you have an hour. The hours are simply not long enough.4. You have to pay $25 per day to use the gym. My company does not compensate me for using the gym. At any other hotel, the gym would be included in the enormous cost of the hotel. Not here.Bottom line is, the rooms are big and beautiful with big beautiful bathrooms, but they cost way more than I would ever spend if the company were not paying for it. I would prefer to have a room and bathroom 1/2 the size, include coffee, include a gym (included in the cost), with hours of say, 5 am to 10 pm or midnight.The food is ridiculously expensive, especially in this ecnomy.If you are thinking about this hotel in Vegas, for your conference, don't. It costs way too much, and your employee will constantly wish she was home."
251,303,"Apr 26 2009 	Amazing HOTEL	I cannot say enough about the friendly staff and cleanliness of the hotel. This was my first time staying here as I found an amazing deal on Expedia. I went for 2 nights with 6 of my friends. We had originally booked a room in the FORUM tower, but upon check in I asked if there were any upgrades available, and for $70 per night we were able to get an upgraded room in the AUGUSTUS tower with a jacuzzi bath, 600 square foot, with a view of the Bellagio fountains. It was definitely worth it! One down fall was that the pool area was being renovated and there was some construction, so some styrofoam was flying around. Besides that, upon check in they said our room would be ready in an hour and that they would text me when it was done. They never did this, so we waited three hours to get into our room, which I was not happy about. However, I did ask if they could do something for the inconveneince so they gave me a 25 dollar credit to use at the hotel. I thought that was nice. Overall, amazing hotel, and would definitely reccommend it! It has a great prime location and amazing pool area! They are planning on opening the two other pools in June, so that will make it even better!"
252,303,Apr 26 2009 	Great hotel experience!!!	We stayed at Caesars 4/12-4/16/09 and it was great. Tried the 20.00 trick to upgrade to the Augustus or Palace towers and the clerk gave me back the 20.00 and said it was not necessary she would take care of it. She gave us a room in the Augustus Tower that was fabulous. We checked out the room and then went out to gamble some and when we came back there was a box and note in front of our room door. I had mentioned that we were celebrating by birthday at the end of the month and she sent up a note saying Happy Birthday from Caesars and a leather luggage tag and matching key chain. The service was wonderful and we totally enjoyed Caesar's.
253,303,Apr 23 2009 	great vegas hotel!	Stayed at Ceasers with my wife for 3 days in July 2008 and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was our first time in Vegas ( from Australia) so it was important to be close to the action and Ceasers is! Its location is very central and convenient and the hotel itself was awesome although the staff did let it down on 1 ocassion. Our only regret was that we didnt stay longer but we WILL be back and when we are we will be back at Ceasers for sure.
254,303,Apr 22 2009 	it was the best stay ever !!!!	i really enjoyed my stay at the palace my boyfriend and i stayed from march 9 tilmarch 13.. the room was clean and there was always something to do insideceasars's.. i really enjoyed the club &quot;pure&quot;.. and the food was just as great !!!!
255,303,"Apr 22 2009 	Our wedding	We chose to get married at Casears Palace as we loved it so much the first time we stayed there. We got married in the Venus Garden outside, with the weather over there always sunny it's so worth it. Our Wedding Co-ordinator was Melissa and she was excellent. We also arrange our wedding reception in one of the ballrooms as we had 32 members of family joining us. The room looked fantastic and the staff on the night were great. Whilst arranging everything their communication was excellent even with the time difference, they were excellent with emails and replied to my queries within 24 hours. This made everything so much easier. If you forget to do something then they just take care of it for you.The photographer was excellent, professional and friendly.I would definatley recommend getting married at Casears Palace. 10/10"
256,303,"Apr 18 2009 	As close to perfect as one could get	I checked into Caesars Palace on 4/12 and was staying comped till 4/17 .Years ago I used to be a gambler at Harrah's in Atlantic City so Caesars was willing to give me 5 free nights. I arrived at 10am and the gold card holders line was already filled with people checking in. I stood in line for about 10 min. A young woman checked me in. I mentioned that I was willing to pay extra for an upgrade. She explained that she could give me a Deluxe room in the Augustine tower for $50 a night extra. I kindly asked what was available for $100 a night. She said she could put me into a 1050 sq ft Royal Suite in the Forum tower. The room was fantastic. It was perfect for me, my wife, and me grandson. We all felt relaxed and comfortable, and the best part was we never got on each others nerves. The room had two minor problems. The LCD TV in the bathroom did not work, and I seemed to have gotten a bad rash on my feet, hands, and elbows from Caesars bedsheets. I think its the detergent that they use. For restaurants I recommend the Plam. I felt it was inexpensive for the quality food we ate."
257,303,"Apr 16 2009 	Great place to stay!	We stayed at Caesars for three nights, April 11-14 and had a very enjoyable stay. They let us check in early and our room was very clean - the view wasn't great, but oh well. Caesar's is in a great location right in the center of the strip and we found that we were able to get wherever we needed to go easily. I also thought the service was great, our last night there this crazy couple in the next room started arguing very loudly at like 1 a.m. I called the front desk and within 5 minutes they sent someone up to the room to shush them. One thing I will say is that everything is SUPER expensive, but this isn't unique to Caesar's - I think everything in Vegas is that way. Two large mojitos by the pool cost us like $38! But it seemed like this was the case everywhere."
258,303,"Apr 16 2009 	Great stay!	Just returned from a 5 night stay in Vegas, at Caesars. I was there with 7 other family members; celebrating a birthday and a marriage. We arrived late in the evening and were upgraded to rooms in the Palace Tower; twin bathrooms and a jacuzzi, as well as lots and lots of space. My sis and her bf were also upgraded, depsite having checked in a few hours earlier. Coming from the UK, the amount of space in the room was fantastic, as you have to pay through the nose here for good sized rooms. We were very happy with the hotel. We did the breakfast buffet one morning and were very impressed. My husband and I also ate at the Noodle 9 restaurant and were impressed with the food. The Paysard cafe was very nice, perhaps a little pricier than it should have been. All staff were very friendly and we had a great time. Would definitely recommend Casears and would stay there again!"
259,303,"Apr 13 2009 	Great Stay As Always!	We stayed at Caesar's for three days, Thursday through Sunday. It was busy, as it was a holiday weekend, but even so we had a great stay. We were upgraded to Augutus Tower rooms, which were fantastic, and the staff was courteous and attentive. From the bell desk to the valets, everyone was friendly, helpful, and made our trip a memorable one.The mid-Strip location is amazing. It's tough to be in a better spot if you want to be right in the middle of the action. My only knock against Caesar's is that everything on the property is expensive, but this is true of most of the big megaresorts on the Strip. Get water, coffee, snacks, etc, outside of the resort to keep costs down. Even using the ATMs at Caesar's costs $5, so be prepared.Overall, I have to say that this is one of my favourite Vegas properties and I won't hesitate to stay there in the future."
260,303,"Apr 12 2009 	Another great stay at Caesars	My wife and I with another couple stayed from April 8th to the 11th. and it was another fantastic time. We didn't arrive till around 930p and no more than a 10 minute wait to check-in. Even though our rooms were already comped, we were upgraded to a Palace Tower room which was nice. Since we aren't in the room very much, my wife and i didn't care how big or small or what view we had.Was happy that we had quick and easy access to the pool. Despite the changes and construction we were very happy that the pools were even open. Only negative was that despite the 75 degree and sunny day the pool closed at 5p and had last call at 4p. Another negative that we discovered was that most restaurants that we found were closed from 1000a to 1100a. We tried 5 or 6 in the area and couldn't get a meal. So if you want to eat get in before 10 or just wait till after 11.The gambling was successful. Enjoyed most if not all of the dealers, who seemed very professional. They even tried to help some very green blackjack players who were destoying our table with bad plays, knowing that it was costing us money. Overall, we had another great time in Vegas and hope to return sometime soon."
261,303,"Apr 11 2009 	Great Stay!! Lots of Fun!!!	My wife and I stayed here from Sunday April 5th- Thursday April 9th. We had 4 nights comped in a Forum Tower room. When we arrived at 805am, there was no line at the front desk. I asked how early can we check in? They said if we have a room now we can have it. They had a room and an upgrade too, we were placed in the Palace Tower on the 6th Floor. It over looked a roof and we could see The Mirage, TI and The Venetian. Not too bad!! Our room had a jacuzzi in it which we used once. The room was quiet and very nice. The only issue we had was a minor one, we asked to check out at 130 and all they could do was 1pm. So we had our bags by the Video Poker machines for a half hour, while we played. We tried the Cafe Lago Buffet for breakfast and we were disappointed. We also ate at the Cypress Market food court a few times which had a nice selection of food. We tried Serendipity 3 and got some late night snacks. We had a great stay. We would love to do it again."
262,303,"Apr 10 2009 	Nice hotel... horrendous service!""	As lovely as the Palace is, it is not very organized. Family sent UPS/FedEx shipments to me at great cost - only for the items to linger in Caesar's mailroom for days. In fact, nothing was delivered until I made inquiries. And inquiries my family submitted (to keep the shipments a surprise from me), were directed to the mailroom and ignored. Very disappointing, and certainly put a damper on my trip!"
263,303,"Apr 9 2009 	More than I expected!	This was our first trip to Vegas and I have no significant complaints. The hotel was amazing. The first night we arrived we could not get the free upgrade offer and the room we were in was not very nice however they guaranteed us the upgrade for the rest of our stay. The next morning we went to the lobby and we were given our upgrade without any problems. Yes, it is expensive to eat or buy a coffee in the morning however I went to Vegas knowing this so I refuse to complain. The only bad experience was the last night of our stay we decided to eat at the Augustus Cafe and we were seated by the hostess and given menus, our beverages were served by the bus boy, 4 tables came in afte us, had their order taken and we were still sitting there. We decided to get up and walk out. Other than that our trip was terrific and am looking forward to returning next year and staying at this hotel!"
264,303,"Apr 8 2009 	We lived like rockstars	My friends and I stayed March16-20 for our spring break. We are all 21 and love to gamble. We booked our room through travelocity for a very good package flight and room combo price. Upon arrival we were told our room would be ready in aobut 30 minutes so we decided to gamble a bit so we checked our bags and headed off to the casino. About an hour later we returned to get our keys and were told the emperors suite was available in the Forum tower if we were interested. For and extra $400 a night we decided to do this and we got way more than we expected. Our room that we were paying about 600 a night for usually sold for 5000 a night and was two and a half stories and had an absolutely amazing view. I have read that the suite is about 4500 sq. ft. Why they decided to let four college kids stay in this amazing high rollar suite is beyond me but I can truly say we had the trip of a lifetime. We had 6 plasma tv's, about 8 couches and an amazing stereo system that was hooked up throughout the suite and could be operated from one of the 3 remotes throughout the suite. We ate at several of the restaurants throughout the property, I might reccomend spago as a great lunch palce and guy savoy for dinner. The shadow bar was a cool place to get a drink as well. The dealers were pretty nice for the most part and I only caught one dealer making a mistake which i notified the pitt boss and the situation was taken care of. The forum shoppes are very nice and their is a very classy cigar bar Casa Fuente that had a nice humidor and beautiful ladies to serve you drinks. The blackjack odds are not great but they are the same as most strip hotels on their single deck game. I still managed to win a little over $4000 so I cannot complain. I was not impressed with the buffet but every other dining venue was amazing. The only other complaint I had was the checkout line was long but I just tipped the concierge $20 and he took care of my check out with no wait. I am a hospitality major and am going to graduate school for hospitality administration at UNLV and I can say that Caesars truly practices what my professors preach when it comes to customer service. I had a great trip and my only complaint is that I didnt sleep in my amazing bed more than 5 hours in the 5 days I was there. I cannot wait for my next trip to Caesars."
265,303,"Apr 7 2009 	Excellent from Beginning to End	Stayed at Caesars palace for two nights 4/1-4/3 on comps. We booked a room in the Forum tower based on the reviews here. Check-in at 7pm was a breeze, no lines at all. And Yes, the $20 upgrade trick worked. We were upgraded to the Executive Suite in the Palace Tower. This room was huge. It had 2 bathrooms, a living room, and the bedroom had a sitting area. A television was also in the bathroom mirror. 2 flat screen tvs. We had no compliants other than there was not a view from our room. Went to the pool and encountered tons of construction. There are no heated pools but the lifeguard told us that the new pools will be heated. Great stay"
266,303,"Apr 6 2009 	Amazing stay at Caesars!!!	Caesars Palace is just sheer elengance and glamour, from the pools to The Colosseum, amazing. We stayed in the Palace Tower Duluex Room which was ver nice room with an over-sized shoer to sinks, a gold toilet and a jacuzza. We had a good view of the Strip, which was facing North Las Vegas Blvd.) We also had a great view of The Colosseum. We also went to Cher, was was fantastic my 15 year old son is a big fan, it was really good but she had the &quot;Vegas&quot; throat when we went, but you should go its a great expierence I would reccomened this hotel to anyone who wants a taste of glamour when they are in Vegas. I am going again this year and staying at Caesars Palace and see one of my sons idols Bette Midler!"
267,303,"Apr 4 2009	They don't tell you this	My experience at Ceasers was not horrible, but we asked for a non-smoking room, which in most hotels is on a non-smoking floor. Apparently, this is not the case at Ceasers. We could smell cigarette smoke in our room...not stale, left-over, from a previous guest smoke, but like next door smoke coming through the vent or something. There are four boxes sitting on the dresser: chips, peanuts, cashews, poppycock and a Romance Package. There is no visible sign telling you this--the bellhop didn't tell us this--the front desk didn't tell us this--nor did the group we were with told us this, but if you even remove any of these boxes, you are charged for it. How do they know? There are sensors under them. Luckily, we called to find out what the deal was and if we were in fact charged for the things we touched, but didn't use. You have 30 seconds to look at it and put it back before you are charged. A small, single serve bag of Poppycock, nicely packaged in a fancy box was $10. Outrageous are the prices of this hotel! You pay big money for the rooms, which are nice, and then are so strengent about every little thing. There is no coffee pot in the room and if you use room service, be prepared to pay by the pot; $20. Don't order a soft drink, it's $4, but in the machine you can get it for $2.50. I wasn't impressed with the Shops at the Forum compared to the ones in some of the other hotel shops. I brought my computer so I could go online and research transportation and shows, etc. I could only get online with the hotel WiFi for $15. WIth the prices of everything else, they should provide this. Also, the ironing board stunk! No padding and very hard to iron on. They have a swimming pool, but there was so much construction, the jack hammers made laying by the pool impossible. I probably wouldn't stay here again."
268,303,"Apr 2 2009 	caesars was sheer elegance	caesars is a 10 star hotel,staff all round were superb.great roomsask for upgrade wen u book in,a 20 dollar tip is worthwhile for upgradeamericans were extremely helpful and so politeloved it"
269,303,"Apr 2 2009 	What a disappointment.	I was shocked about how bad my experience was at this hotel. I was really looking forward to staying and playing here for the weekend. Some of my friends were staying at other hotels. I thought that this hotel would be much more fun and comforable for everyone to gamble and hang out at. I was so wrong. We all felt very uncomfortable and scared with the crowd hanging out in the casino. I am sure that there was security all over the hotel but visible security, no where to be found. When entering the women's restroom, I was embarassed thinking I entered the men's mistakenly. That was not the case. There was a group of guy's in the women's restroom hitting on girls. Yes, hitting on girls in the restroom. When I made a comment about them being in the restroom they responded to me that the men's restroom was broken. These were loud and huge ghetto looking guys. The only thing that may have helped calm me down was the contact high I got from them. I was so uncomfortable that I did not stay any longer to play at this hotel. What was even more disappointing about my stay was that I paid to upgrade my room. I wish that I could have had something positive to report on my hotel stay. I did stay at another Harrah's property which I had a good experience at."
270,303,"Apr 1 2009 	RUINED my 7 Stars Annual Trip!	The room was great; the location is great. A couple of the restaurants where we ate were good. BUT . . . I will NEVER stay at Caesar's again based on the experiences we had with the executive host, Total Rewards, 7 stars registration - etc. The people are condescending, inexperienced and/or uninformed. Their collective attitudes and lack of service ruined this whole trip. It is now 3 days later -- I'm at home -- and we're still trying to get my account corrected. NEVER AGAIN WILL I STAY AT CAESARS."
271,303,"Mar 31 2009 	Poor service - unfortunate	Location is central though the sheer length of the Strip and the frequent construction/road works/congestion on Las Vegas Blvd means it might not necessarily help much - you should buffer ample time to drive out of the Strip or to other resorts towards the ends of the Strip (for shows that start on time). Rooms are decent but probably overrated. We were told ours would be a 'nice room' for honeymooners in the recently refurbished Forum Tower - while it is well-maintained and modernly furnished it had a poor blocked view and nothing to shout about. You would probably have to upgrade to get a themed room. The show stopper here is really the very curt service and indifferent staff who will not hesitate to say no and treat you like yet another guest passing through. Calls to guest relations/housekeeping/room service took 3-5min before they were answered; check-in/out queues were long and processed by unfriendly staff; and more often than not deliveries to the room took longer than half an hour, once never arriving despite repeated, futile reminder calls. The person on the line even said it was barely 3min since our last call (it was more like 10-15min) and promised that the shower cap requested would arrive if we waited - which did not happen! In the end my wife waited over an hour for nothing and that really ate into our rest time. The feeling came close to silent suffering..! I would guess that the hotel might be understaffed/overworked... Apart from the iconic theme and decor around the hotel, we have to give a thumbs-down - this is arguably the worst out of the 4 hotels we stayed in over the course of our holiday. Come with no expectations, or prepare to be badly disappointed."
272,303,"Mar 29 2009 	A ghost of its past	Coasting on a very yesteryear Las Vegas reputation, this now soulless edifice is like a ride at Disneyland that's had its day. Though the rooms are clean and comfortable provided one stays in only one of three towers Augustus,Palace or Forum (forget the rest-they are junk rooms) this once great casino is ludicrously overpriced for every little thing. ($14.95 for internet service for 24 hours, room charge of $8 for a slice of toast and a cup of coffee plus a $5.00 room charge plus 18% gratuity...etc) It is now only worth a quick walk through to ogle at the over the top excesses in decoration. Restaurants on the whole have become mediocre with only perhaps Bradley Ogden as the lone standout. Guy Savoy has a restaurant there where the set menu is $290.00 per person which in this economy sounds a tad over the top. Forget playing there as every machine and table game is outfitted with terrible odds stacked against you. In its day Caesar's Palace had charm in its gaudiness and its atmosphere was exciting. Now it is just aggressively tacky. As an example I wanted to purchase a local newspaper in one of the gift shops only to be told that none carry the local paper anymore. When I asked why, the lady behind the counter told me she had heard that management didn't want their customers to read about the much better and more reasonable offers that were to be had elsewhere in terms of food and entertainment. One can get a much better experience for the same or less money on the strip at Wynn's,The Venetian or the Palazzo where true luxury reigns as opposed to the ersatz luxury of Caesar's Palace."
273,303,"Mar 28 2009 	We would stay here again	We booked a 3 night stay from Tuesday to Friday, between March Madness games. We were able to get an amazing rate using a promo code tip from the Fatwallet forums at $75 a night for a Classic Room. I had read plenty of reviews saying that these rooms were horrible, but we never found out. We asked for an upgrade at the desk, received a Palace Tower room at no extra charge and tipped the clerk $20! The Palace Tower room was great for us, lots of space to spread out, which is a real luxury compared to your standard hotel rooms. The bathroom had two sinks, a separate shower and a jetted tub. Even though the elevators for this room seem to be a mile away from the strip, it was nice to step off the elevator and be right at the pool area.We lounged by the pool 3 of the 4 days we were there. Lots of construction going on, but definitely a nice pool area. My only complaint may be that the drink and food service poolside was spotty at best...there was only one girl working the pool....just too many people for one person to serve.We wandered the hotel and saw the casino area and all the shops, which was impressive, but I can shop at home and we are pretty low-rollers, so we gambled elsewhere. We joined the Players Club which got us two $20 meal vouchers for the buffet. We ate there for breakfast one morning. My husband thought it was amazing, I thought it was fine. I don't know if it would be my choice if we were paying for it, but for free it was great. Great location, centered on the strip. We would definitely stay here again, especially if we could get such a great rate again."
274,303,"Mar 27 2009 	Good stay - Reasonalble value	My wife and another couple all stayed at this hotel. We booked rooms with king sized beds and upon arrival there were no more rooms availble with king bed so we were all stuck with doubles which effected our comfort a little bit. We also found the room service to be slow and the service on the casino floor and lounges was lacking a bit. They did upgrade us from a classic room to suites at no cost which was nice and the rooms, although a little out of date, were kept clean. If I were to stay there again, I would phone ahead to be sure I get the accommodations I requested."
275,303,"Mar 26 2009	How can you do Vegas 	Hi everyone,I stayed at Caesars on the 19th March for three nights as part of a stag night (batchelor party) we had already upgraded to the Palace tower with our travel agent however I did tip the check in guy $20 and this worked in the fact that our room went from been ready in two hours to &quot;its ready now sir&quot;. Apart from been totally blown away by Vegas this hotel exceeded all our expectations. The staff were always polite, the place spotless and the location is fantastic. I cannot recommend this hotel enough, one thing I have decided is that I will be returning and I think that says it all! VIVA!By the way we flew with BMI from Manchester in economy, Never again, staff looked unapproachable, food &amp; drinks at a minimum frequency. Ive flown across the atlantic with Virgin, BA , First Choice &amp; My Travel and they are all far far better.If you get chance go on the helicopters to the grand canyon its an amazing trip!"
276,303,"Mar 26 2009 	plush stay.	We stayed here for our honeymoon and the location and hotel itself were brilliant and could not be faulted. We had a room in the forum tower, which meant no views but a lovely, sleek, comfortable and affordable room. The one thing i will say is that currently, esp for british travellers, it is very very expensive in Las Vegas. For example a beer and vodka-lemonade cost us $17! in the hotel. We ate at the cypress market, Trevi restaurant and Susji Roku in the forum shops and enjoyed all of our meals- a little odd to be ordering a glass of wine rather than a bottle. All in all a fantastic stay."
277,303,Mar 25 2009 	Amazing Rooms!	Beautiful rooms. The bathroom was larger than some hotel rooms I've stayed in. Personally I hate Las Vegas and only go there for business. But Caesar's does make the trip enjoyable. It's a great hotel and the rooms are amazing.
278,303,Mar 23 2009 	NCAA March MADNEsss at Caesars	Check in was easy. Room available without waiting. Room was VERY NICE with a view of the fountains at Bellagio. Something to be seen at night. Caesars was crowded with March Madness people. Normal hotel service was good. Had dinner at Bejing Noodle company. Service was POOR at best. Food was good. Lunch at BObby Flays Mesa....AWESOME as ususal and the bartender EFREM is great. BEST MOJITOs in the planet.
