99,1881,Jun 29 2009 	Excellent Hotel in the Heart of the City	My teenagers actually said that this hotel has spoiled them for other hotels. Not a bad review from cynical teenagers.The hotel was up scale in the middle of Times Square and as purchased through the Name-Your-Price feature at Priceline...was a very good value. The room was comfortable and quiet.
100,1881,"Jun 29 2009 	New York Marriott Marquis is a Great Hotel!!!	Just wrapped up a two day stay at this wonderful hotel and wish I could have stayed longer! Check-in a breeze, clean, beautiful room with comfy bed. One thing I can say is that when they say they are in the heart of the theater district - they really are! On the downside, the pricing at the hotel resaurants wasa bit steep. A simple breakfast for one averaged $50. Juniors, a great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner, is right across the street was a great alternative. A short walk to John Pizzaria, Carmine's and Sardi's, as well as Rstaurant Row. Be sure to give Becco's on Restaurnat Row a try for great italian. In all, I can't speak highly enough of this hotel and we will be back!"
101,1881,"Jun 28 2009 	GREAT SERVICE GREAT LOCATION WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN	I arrived at around 7:45 pm at the hotel, with my fiance from La Guardia Airport. It was a long trip for us, so we were exhausted and excited at the same time, since this was our first time to New York.As soon as we got out of our shuttle, at the street level of our hotel, a very gentle empoyee approached us and took care of our luggage, he gave us some tickets for the luggage, and told us that they would take it to our room, once we got a room assignated, and instructed us to go to the front desk located at the 8th floor.Elevator wait, was 2 minutes, using a very easy system (14 elevators, each one marked with a letter from A to N. In the middle, two buttons pannels, you put your floor number, the pannel tells you wich elevator to take. That`s it)When we got to the front desk, i handed my reservation to a very gentle lady, who checked it and said everything was in place. I asked her if it was possible to change the room, from a double bed room, to a king size bed room, since one of my party traveller couldn`t make it to new york.She did it in just one minute, and gave us a better room with a Times Square view, at the same rate i had booked.The room was spacious and clean. The view was stunning. Five minutes laters, the luggage arrived in the same conditions i left it in the street level, and it is fair to say that i was at the 30th floor.Internet access worked perfect. It is possible to pay for a cable access or if you have a laptop you could get the wireless connection at no cost.We went several times to the concierge level, to ask for information about addreses and restaurants, and broadway shows, and everytime they were helpful.The location of this hotel is absolutely a major benefit. Everything is in walking distance, and if it`s not then you have several bus stops and subway stations nearby, to take you everywhere.Check out time is 12:00 pm. And our flight to Miami was at 6:45 pm. So we have to options: 1. Ask for a late check out, wich is granted on availability, and costs 30$ per extra hour, or 2. Check out at the appropriate time and leave your luggage at the concierge. They would give tickets for the luggage, and once you are ready to go, they will take it to the street level. We choose the second option. We check out at 9:00 am, and leave the hotel to get the most of our time in New York.We went back to the hotel at 4:00 pm, and handed the luggage tickets to the bellboy, who gave us back our luggage. I have no complaints about the hotel or its staff, as a matter of fact, i only have compliments for this people, that make everything possible for me and my fiance to have a pleasant stay. And they achieved it"
102,1881,"Jun 23 2009 	Very nice rooms with GREAT location and staff!	We took our two 16 year old daughters to celebrate their 16th bdays. It was a fabulous and convenient place to stay. We requested early check in and they granted it and gave us a room with a view! Nice views of time Square. I was surprised at how quiet the hotel was considering it is in the heart of Times Square. The elevators were fast and always available. The Concierge's were incredibly helpful! (and we asked them ALOT!!!) The rooms are spacious with a refridgerator and a nice flat screen tv and a safe. The bathrooms are big enough for two teenagers to get ready together. The fitness center is gorgeous (even though we didn't actually work out.) Overall, the LOCATION is just awesome...so close to everything and lots of easy little eating places without having to eat fancy. The theatres are withing a few feet of the hotel...This was just a GREAT trip and the hotel really made it that much better!"
103,1881,Jun 22 2009 	Marquis was fantastic!	I traveled to New York City with my kids while my wife was in Norway for memorial for her father who had passed away in March. I really didn't want to go to New York City because of the impression I had that the people were rude and shopping and restaurants were too crowded and just too much hustle and bustle to enjoy yourself. This hotel was so comfortable and inviting that we felt right at home as soon as we arrived. Check-in was fast and courteous even though there were many people also checking-in. We had a view of Time Square and the room was very clean and spacious for the three of us. All you have to do is walk outside the hotel and you are just absorbed into that wonderful lifestyle that New Yorkers are accustomed to. Everything is right there and so convenient. The restaurant right across the street (Juniors) was great. We ate there three times and every time the service was courteous and prompt. The food was the best and prices were reasonable for the middle of Manhatten. We went to several shows one of which was The Lion King which was literally 30 steps from the entrance to the hotel. It was raining when the show let out and we walked out of the theater and back into the hotel with only a few raindrops hitting us. The concierge (several different people) helped us with dinner reservations and suggestions and we could not have been happier with the choices they made. My kids and I had such a great time we are planning a return trip during Winter break. Would not think of staying anywhere else. I wa so impressed with this hotel and New York City that I'am going to try and convince my wife to move here.
104,1881,"Jun 22 2009 	Location location location	My family and I just returned from a week at the Marriott Marquis. We didn't use any of the hotel services (no restaurant, no fitness club), but would definitely stay here again. You just can't beat the location. We got a great rate on the Marriott website (AAA discount). They put us on the 40th floor overlooking Time Square. The plays we went to were well within walking discount (2 were less than a block). Access to subways were easy. I highly recommend Juniors Deli across the street and Times Square Bagels on 44th street for after-theatre dessert and breakfast respectively. We will definitely stay here again!"
105,1881,"Jun 21 2009 	very very disappointing. service was awful.	I live in NYC but chose to get two rooms at this hotel for my bachelorette party. I was excited to stay in a touristy location and enjoy the amenities of the hotel like the concierge lounge. I chose this hotel in particular because my mom is a platinum Marriott Rewards member and had a lot of points that I could use. She called Marriott Reservations and explained that she wanted to book the hotel in her name, using her points, so that I would receive the amenities given to platinum members, but that they should put a note in the system saying that I was the one who would be checking in, not her. The main reason we did this was to get access to the concierge lounge, which the reservations agent said would be great and that I'd love it. I called the hotel twice during the week before my stay, double checking that it was fine for me to check in without her, etc. The people over the phone were great and said that it would be fine. When I went to check in, I was told that no note appeared in the system and that I could not check in unless I got my mother on the phone. She happened to be going out of town that day (out of the country) and I didn't think I'd be able to get her on the phone. Luckily after a few attempts I was able to reach her and she explained to the manager that I was supposed to be checking in. While all of this was happening, we were talking to the desk clerk about possible suite upgrades. She said that there were no more suites left that night, but it was okay because we were so close to the concierge lounge and we'd have a lot of space to hang out in there. After they got off the phone with my mom, the front desk clerk then informed me that (a) the concierge lounge WAS NOT OPEN OVER THE WEEKEND, and (b) it didn't matter, because I would not have been eligible for it anyway since my mom was the platinum member and not me. I'm sorry, two major problems here. The entire reason I booked this hotel was for the concierge lounge. I had ten people coming to hang out in two rooms. I wanted access to the lounge. If it was going to be closed, why did the desk agent tell me TWO SECONDS EARLIER that it didn't matter that I didn't have a suite because the lounge was so close to our room? Are you kidding me? And then to add insult to injury by saying that they wouldn't have given me access anyway? If that was really the protocol (which it may be), why wouldn't you say that while booking? Why wouldn't you say that the lounge was closed during those dates when I specifically said that I needed access to it?THEN, they screwed up the rooms. They promised that we'd have adjoining rooms with two double beds, and what do you know, they were not adjoining. I soon learned that the only adjoining rooms were king/2 doubles. We eventually just decided to move into a king room. The rooms itself were nice and fine, but I think the bottom line was that this hotel was not the best one for our needs. It really made me upset that they misrepresented it as something it was not. If we had known from the get go that the lounge was closed and that they did not have adjoining rooms that had two double beds each, we would not have booked here. Of course, we did not find out until we wasted a TON of points on our stay. I am very disappointed in what happened. I did speak to the manager about this during check in and he did not seem to care at all."
106,1881,"Jun 20 2009 	Great view; great rates with AAA special	Enjoyed our stay at the Mariott Marquis. Once in a life-time views of Times Square. Was able to get a special rate through Mariott and AAA with a Thursday check-in. Had a Times Square View room and really enjoyed the lights and watching the hustle below. The amenities and service were very acceptable. Subway was just a few blocks in either direction. Definitely a solid, high-end 3-star hotel."
107,1881,"Jun 20 2009 	Had a great stay!	We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. and the service efficient. We had used the online concierge for special requests and found everything we asked for upon arrival.Absolutely no problem with the elevators, we haven't had more than a minute wait at peak times.We found the location to be very convenient and very safe even after dark.We'll definitely be going back!"
108,1881,Jun 19 2009 	Great Hotel/Great Location	This hotel is right in the middle of Time Square. One block from the subway. The rooms are very confortable. We were very lucky our room had a view of Times Square. We recommend this hotel
109,1881,"Jun 17 2009 	Fantastic experience	The hotel was booked as part of our holiday package by our cruise company. I had read the reviews before going but I thought this hotel was wonderful. our 25th wedding anniversary took place whilst in NY. We were upgraded to the 39th floor. The View wasnt that fantastic but the room was wonderful, large and clean. Staff were very helpful and even supplied extra luggage tags. Being in such a central location made it easy to get around and the fact that people were sitting out in broadway just watching hte world go by at midnight seemed a little crazy but cool. felt very safe inNYC and the hotel and would definately stay there again."
110,1881,"Jun 17 2009 	Expensive but great location	The Marriott Marquis is located literally right in the middle of Times Square and the Theatre District. It is a HUGE hotel with 49 floors and a LOT of people in it. There are always people around and some elevator waits, etc. That being said, it is a nice hotel and you can't beat the location. Rooms were nice. It was actually pretty quiet and the views of times square were amazing. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom was roomy. Big, flatscreen TV with lots of channels. Would stay again."
111,1881,"Jun 16 2009 	Excellent Hotel Incredible Location Gorgeous Views!	I traveled to NYC in April 09 for a friend's b-day and we absolutely loved the Marquis. It was a great location and we had an amazing view of Times Square. I loved how big the hotel was, and the rooms weren't small at all. (I understand many NYC hotel rooms are super tiny). We actually saw The Little Mermaid, which was conveniently located two steps from the hotel. Everything worked out perfectly! Loved the hotel, good service, clean rooms, spacious, and modern. It was great to stay in Midtown, too; we were halfway between lower Manhattan and upper Manhattan. We're returning for my mom's birthday in August...cannot wait!!"
112,1881,Jun 16 2009 	Credit Card Guarantee Means Nothing	We arrived in New York Late Tuesday and were only staying 2 nights. I researched hotels in Times Square and selected the Marriott Marquis based on the reviews from Trip Advisor. My husband called the hotel to let them know our flight was a late one and to have them send a car to the airport to pick us up. We arrived at the hotel to check in only to be told that they did not have a room available. They had guest that wanted to extend their stay and gave them our room. I had printed out my confirmation that stated Credit Card Guarantee. Basically that really means nothing but had I not showed up at all my credit card would have been charged for the room that wasn't even available! We travel a lot and I have never had this happen ever!!
113,1881,"Jun 13 2009	Perfect location. Wonderful stay!	The Marquis is right in the middle of Times Square and is the perfect location for easy access to almost all Broadway theaters and many wonderful restaurants. I was with my mom, who doesn't walk very much, and this hotel made it very easy to walk to all the shows. Getting a cab under the hotel was simple and fast and we didn't have to wait that long for an elevator at all.The staff was very nice and the lounge on the 8th floor was the perfect place to rest, have a great view and a drink. The rooms were kept very clean as was the hotel and we had aan amazing view!!!The hotel was a little pricey, I am sure because it's right in the middle of everything."
114,1881,"Jun 9 2009 	Amazing Location Incredible Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for our 5th anniversary with my husband. We have wanted to stay here for a while. It is amazing location. Our Times Square view room was awesome. 42nd floor- ultra clean room, comfy bed. The hotel was in the perfect location. Lots of great restaurants on site, make sure you go to the top revolving restaurant for a drink."
115,1881,"Jun 6 2009 	The best location	You could see time square from our room. It was christmas time when I stayed there with some of my family. The hotel was decorated very nicely for the holiday. There are a few very nice shops in the hotel lobby. It is a very large hotel and the elevator system was kind of confusing at first. The room we had was nice but nothing special in my opinion. It had two chairs and a table by the window which was nice since we had a time square view. The bed was nice, I slept well. The best part about the hotel was the location."
116,1881,"Jun 5 2009 	Great location and loved 9 To 5 at the Marquis Theatre	I went to a book convention and brought along 2 friends. The location is great right -outside the hotel is Times Square, lots of places to eat and subways nearby both to the north and south. Also inside the hotel is the theatre for 9 To 5 the Broadway show. We had bought tickets ahead of time and were surprised the theatre was inside the hotel. The rooms are very clean and spacious and include a mini safe. The internet fees were high so I decided not to log on."
117,1881,"Jun 4 2009 	Nice hotel great location	My husband and I stayed 3 nights at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square in May in May 2009. He was there on business and I joined him for a long weekend. The hotel was very nice: clean rooms, comfortable mattress, quiet. The elevator issue that some people referred to in earlier reviews seems to have been addressed. To call an elevator, you input your floor number at a central panel. You're then directed to a specific elevator. Other than perhaps one time, we never waited more than a couple of minutes, if that, for an elevator and even that one time, the wait was probably only a few minutes. The hotels location is great: right in the heart of Times Square and convenient to the Central Park area as well."
118,1881,"Jun 3 2009 	Right in the heart of New York	In the middle of Times Square, walking distance to the Park, Rockerfeller Centre, Thatres, Empire State, and some great restaurants and bars, this is a great location. The hotel itself is a superb design, with fun glass lifts which worked quickly and efficiently, spacious rooms - ours overlooked the bright lights of Times Square - and some great bars with views across Manhatten. The staff at check-in, the concierge and all the bar staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. We had a fabulous time."
119,1881,"Jun 2 2009 	FABULOUS NYC HOTEL	I have stayed in this hotel numerous times in the past few years. When I come into the city this is where I always stay and I'm never disappointed. It's beautiful and such a pleasure to stay here. Some people complain about the elevators, but I never have a problem. The rooms are lovely and spotless and the location is perfect if you are seeing a show."
120,1881,Jun 2 2009 	Girls trip to NYC	I just returned from a 3 night/4 day trip to NYC with my friends. We stayed at the Marquis for an amazing price $181.00/night unheard of for NYC. It is definitely in the heart of it all. All Theater that is! This is my 3rd visit to NYC but my first stay in Times Square. I would have to say that it will be my last. I prefer alittle quieter location. As far as the hotel goes it was top notch! We were on the 32nd floor with a tiny view of times square. The room was huge for NYC standards plenty of room for the 4 of us. There is a starbucks in the 1st floor lobby and on the 8th floor lobby. Restuarants are available although we did not eat at the hotel they were always busy. The lounge was nice for cocktails in the evening. This is a very busy hotel at all hours of the day and night. But all in all we had a fabulous time.
121,1881,"May 30 2009 	as good as they say	Most other reviewers have given the thumbs up. I must do so also. Execllent location. Modern decor. Spacious lobby. Room very large(we has a corner room). Bed clean and comfortable. Bathroom small but hey it's a bathroom. Excellent shower and towels. It can get a bit pricey, but so is all of NY. Park next door to save few bucks from valet. Coffee shop really expensive. Great deli's and coffee shops right outside front door."
122,1881,"May 30 2009 	Unbelieveable 36 hours in New York and this was the epicenter!	At $259 a night mid-week smack in the middle of Times Square, the Marquis is an unbelievable hotel for tourists and business visitors alike. I arrived late on a Tuesday night seriously jet-lagged. Traffic to the Marriott is blocked from Broadway, and you have to enter from 46th. Beware that even your in-car GPS system will probably not work reliably in the concrete canyons of this neighborhood.The interior is simply overwhelming with an atrium literally reaching for the sky from the 8th floor lobby. Space age, art deco, and retro designs combine to make a true 21st-century hotel lobby while capturing the richer qualities of the city's past. Check-in was absolutely painless, and I was assigned a junior suite on the 24th floor with a view of Broadway. The View rotating restaurant sits atop at the 42nd floor.The enormous 8th floor hosts a number of bars, restaurants, and the usual Starbucks and reception/concierge desks. It's easy to drift away while watching the elevators whiz overhead and sipping cappuccino or a cosmopolitan in the Atrium. Peer down upon Times Square from the Broadway Lounge, or grab some traditional sushi at Katen. I found the staff very helpful and friendly. I had breakfast in the concierge lounge on the 30th floor one day, and it was fairly standard fare. No oatmeal, however. The fitness center is comprehensive. The elevator system takes some learning but quickly becomes self-explanatory. Enter the floor you want in a keypad, and a display points you to the right lift. There's a nominal pedestrian area, and morning shows film there, so there are usually cameras about. There are plenty of photo ops with real FDNY trucks and personnel, and shopping galore within a short walk or taxi ride. Restaurants and lively spots on 46th and 47th are a few steps away. Subway access is easy, and the whole of Manhattan and Brooklyn are a few stops away."
123,1881,"May 26 2009 	Very convenient	In the American way, the rooms are enormous (I don't think many Americans appreciate just how humungous the average hotel room is in their country!) - two queen sized beds. Just perfect for two friends sharing. Everythign was fine - all worked well and was efficient. Loved the noodle bar restaurant. And the bar overlooking Times Square. Just the place to while away some time on a hot weekend between wearing our feet to stumps sightseeing. Perfectly placed for theatre, which we enjoyed."
124,1881,"May 19 2009 	Protect your valuables	After checkout I realized that I had left my expensive watch on the night table. A few hours later I contacted the hotel and was told it had not been found or turned in to lost and found. My options: none, besides reporting it to their loss prevention department. I was informed that according to NY State Statute, if a valuable is left behind, the hotel is not responsible for the loss. Guess I'll start looking for a job in hotel housekeeping; it's more lucrative than you realize and the hotel does nothing about it when sticky fingers enter the room."
125,1881,"May 14 2009 	location loation	The hotel certainly couldnt be better placed the tour buses just around the corner shops and theatres all nearby.We were wellcomed by smiling and efficient front desk staff, and upgraded [at a price] to a Time Square view,our room was clean and ok for size,five days in we discovered that we needed to ask for robes,seems mean considering the room rate.Despite some earlier reviews we had no problems with lifts the most we ever waited was a few minuits, guess what ever the problem was it has now been sorted.Dinner in the revolving restaurant was a pleasant enough experience but again pricey,a weak pound dosen't go very far.All in all we enjoyed our six day stay,just a gripe about NY cabs, they are the most miserable bunch I've come across in any city in the world even when you are tipping15/20% getting a smile proved impossible."
126,1881,"May 12 2009 	So-So	Went for Mother's day weekend with 2 daughters. Used Marriott points so for free, it was a great deal. However next time we'll stay elsewhere. The location of Times Square seemed like it'd be great but reality was we should have stayed closer to the shopping. Times Square was a nightmare to walk to/from anywhere. Obviously that's not the hotel's fault. The things I found wrong with the place were the bathroom wasn't the cleanest or in best shape(toilet seat had cracks throughout, stains on floor),had to request more towels because limited amount were kept in room, minimal toiletries are available for guests, no mini-bar or small fridge in room, NOISE from adjoining rooms and hallway was horrific--you could actually hear the toilet flushing next door, elevators were a pain to actually get on because of the fancy computerized system, temp in room was either hot or cold with no middle ground, and video checkout didn't work. Was very disappointed there wasn't a salon in the hotel."
127,1881,"May 8 2009 	AMAZING Location!!!!!	Rooms: Very clean, room service is great, very spacious, great flat screen TVs, unfortunately the coffee machine is very poor. Otherwise great. Price: Quite expensive but it is new york!Location: AMAZING. Central to everything. In the heart of Times Square. There is food open 24 hours nearby. Service: Was a bit worried about reviews saying lines were long or they had to wait an hour for the lfits, but we had no such issues!!!Internet: Very expensive 16.95 per 24 hours, but it works well?!Things I would change about the hotel: Add a swimming pool to the gym! Have a kettle in the room, have different toiletries! (ginger smelling was not very nice!)Stayed here for over 7 nights, overall very happy!"
128,1881,"May 7 2009	Great Location	You don't stay at the Marriott Marquis for price...it is just the place to be. I usually prefer values, but am addicted to the convenience that the NYC Marquis offers. If you are travelling to NYC for theater, shopping, and Times Square, there is no better place to stay. Yes, the rooms needs to be updated, staff could be friendlier, and prices could be lower. But it is NYC so you take what you can get."
129,1881,"May 6 2009 	Brillant location	First visit and certainly not the last. Great location, smack bang in Time Square. Good hotel very busy, no problems with Lifts. Service was good, we wanted a late checkout and we were offered until 3.00pm and no extra cost."
130,1881,"May 3 2009 	at the centre of everything	for a hotel in the very centre of the hustle &amp; bustle of New York city we found this place to be fairly quiet and the location was excelent (almost all of the places we wanted to visit were within 15 mins walking distance). Other reviewers have complained about the lifts but we never waited more that 1 minute for our to arrive even on a Monday when there were over 20 different conferences going on - overall a really good, affordable hotel."
131,1881,"May 1 2009 	A Great Place to Visit	This was my first trip to New York and I definitely was not disappointed!! The Marquis is an absolutely marvelous place to stay. Location, location, location - it's right in the heart of the theater district, which is wonderful.The staff is most helpful and the accommadations are elegant. Well worth the money!!"
132,1881,"Apr 22 2009 	Perfect Hotel	I went to Marriott Marquis with my fiance to do some tourism and to participate to a Dental Meeting. The bedroom was clean, spacious, beautiful, well decorareted, with pillows super soft, two queen beds, a 42' LCD TV, coffee machine. The bathroom was also clean and spacious. You can see Times Square through the window.At the top of the building is The View, a restaurant where you can see NYC in 360 cause it rotates! Good food. A little expensive. But is worth the experience.The localizacion is the best part. You exit the hotel and you are in the middle of times Square. Perfect to do shopping, eat in good restaurants and go to plays. I love it. I will definitily go back."
133,1881,"Apr 22 2009 	Best location in NYC - on Times Square	Superbly located, very good, spacious rooms and service.loved the restaurant at the top and the lobby"
134,1881,"Apr 22 2009 	Loved it!	Stayed for 2 nights and were offered a room on 44th Floor. Right in the Heat of New York, Our room faced Times Square, amazing views and great location. The Hotel although a 3.5 star, should be a 4 star delux, as the rooms were very clean, moderately spacious (for a City Hotel) and friendly staff.Breakfast was not included, and was quite expensive, so we opted to eat out, as there is so much of a selection when you are in the middle of everything.My 2 yr old daughter was with us, and she was very unwell on our last evening, we asked for a late check out of 2pm (check out usually midday), and this was granted free of charge. (Usually a 30$ charge per hour is implemented) Deffinately reccommend this Hotel for a great City Break!"
135,1881,Apr 21 2009 	The Best Hotel in New York	if you want to experience the noise and excitement of NY then this is the THE hotel for you. Our teenage daughters had never visited NY and were blown away. It is so central and has the best bar in town ( on the 48th floor) which revolves and the elevators are crazily fast and exciting too !The staff were excellent and moved us to a lower room as the 42nd floor was just too high for my daughter.
136,1881,"Apr 21 2009	Perfect for First Time NYC Visitors	I booked this room for free with my Marriott rewards points, so I can't really complain about anything. This is a standard Marriott room (spacious and clean) in the heart of Times Square. It is in an ideal location if you have booked a Broadway show, or any of the Hop On Hop Off double decker buses as both are located just steps away. Central Park, Empire State Building, and Rockefeller Center are also within comfortable walking distance. Subway stops are close as well, so we never had to use a taxi. Though I didn't use it, the TKTS booth is also located just across the street. I probably wouldn't choose to stay here again as being in the middle of Times Square there is just too much hustle and bustle for my taste. However, for first time visitors, I would totally recommend the Marriott Marquis as it is the perfect location for most of the main tourist activities."
137,1881,"Apr 20 2009 	Right on Times Square... but	Having stayed in The Times Square area before, we knew of The Marquis and decided to give it a go this time as it is right in Times Square. We enjoyed a very efficient check in on the 8th floor. We had requested a high floor, which we were given, on the 40th. The elevator system, where the computer decides your car, worked well with little wait. The room was pretty basic with no 'Wow' factor and like any other 3 star hotel in The US. The beds seemed small and the pillows were not the feather ones we had requested. Check out was quick and easy and the staff we encountered were pleasant and professional. The idea of being on Times Square seemed a good idea at the time of booking. This was our 4th trip to New York but we had not experienced how crowded and chaotic Times Square can be and will look to stay in a different location on our next visit."
138,1881,"Apr 18 2009 	Excellent place for first girls trip to NYC!	Quiet, clean room, excellent location.....walking distance to lots of attractions &amp; food. Staff were very courteous. Biggest compliants &amp; only compliants was internet service at the business center was 8 dollars each 15 minutes &amp; bath towels didn't smell fresh. Would defintely stay there next visit!"
139,1881,"Apr 13 2009 	Great hotel right in the middle of the action	I've stayed here before, and whilst I'm still a Gold Elite I thought I'd stay here again, as the status means I'd probably get upgraded, and also lounge access - handy for the free internet as I don't like paying for net access if I can avoid it. It does form part of my decision of where to stay nowadays, and it's time some of the large chains realised that fleecing their customers is not right, though I can understand why they do it as the business travellers expense it so they can charge the high rates.Got a room on the concierge floor (30th), and no complaints with the room. You know what you're getting with a Marriott, they tend to feel the same wherever you are. Very comfortable bed as always, and blackout curtains so you can sleep at any time of the day or night - handy for those bright Times Square lights! No noise issues from the street either.Had a few issues with the lift this time, which has never happened before. They do tend to get very crowded at peak times (E.g. 7.30pm when people head for the theatres) so leave a bit earlier, and you'll be fine.I'll be staying here again if I get a good rate. If you want to be in the middle of the action, nearby the theatres and don't mind a large impersonal hotel then this is the place to be."
140,1881,"Apr 11 2009 	Great Stay right on Times Square	If you are looking for a Marriot on Times Square this is the place to go! Great Service, Concierge Lounge, Amazing...2 words STAY HERE!"
141,1881,"Apr 10 2009 	Treated like cattle	This hotel has an excellent location on Times Square but is horribly blighted by the lift( elevator) service.There are 2000 rooms and a huge conference facility, but the elevators are simply not adequate to service them. We had a room on the 43rd floor - with great views of Times Square, but it took up to 30 minutes for a lift to arrive to take us up to the room and the same to bring us down. We lost a dinner reservation and nearly lost our theatre evening as a result. When the conference attendees who use the conference centre in the bottom 7 floors of the hotel come out of their conferences the lift system is totally overwhelmed and basically closes down. The problem is that the elevators would probably be adequate to service just the rooms, but once 2-3000 conference delegates are added the system closes down, and starts to malfunction ( lifts fail to arrive, or come, but the doorsdo not open, or the outer door does open, but the inner door does not, which makes passengers very nervous). The staff ( with the exception of the woman who mans the front desk for the 48th floor View restaurant) were mainly sympathetic, but quite frank about their total inability to help. Eventually one evening I had the duty manager accompany us to our floor in the freight elevator after we had waited ( tired,hungry and needing the bathroom after a day out in the city) nearly 40 minutes for an elevator up to our floor.At nearly $700 dollars per room per night, I naively assumed that actually being able to get up to and down from the room would be included, but not so. The most they could dowas advise us not to try to use the elevators when the conference delgates were likely to be doing so, but frankly, being effectively trapped either in my room or 43 floors below is not my idea of customer service. My complaints led to nothing - no reduction in room rate, not so much as the offer of a cup of coffee whilst the elevators setlled down.This is a greedy hotel, which sells a far greater capacity than the infrastructure can cope with. Avoid it. There are plenty of hotels in the area that respect their customers and do not treat then as an inconvenience."
142,1881,"Apr 8 2009 	They Could Care Less	We had a number of problems: they ran out of rooms, they had no rooms with double beds, they did not want to honor the &quot;breakfast included&quot; clause. The single biggest issue was the front desk staff, especially the front desk managers (who were worse than the main desk employees). Since they were full, they reasoned, our experience meant nothing. They did not apologize, they were not accomodating. It was infuriating. The rooms are ok, the location good, the value poor, the elevators horrible (this is a bigger deal than you realize if you want to come and go at dinner time). I have stayed at several other Times Square Hotels (W, Westin, Michelangelo, etc.) - all are MUCH better. AVOID the Marquis."
143,1881,"Apr 5 2009 	Great hotel. Few issues probably won't bug you	I've stayed for a long time at this hotel. I've been there in 2004 for around three weeks, and stayed again in 2007 for roughly the same time.The location is probably the best in NYC. Right on Times Square, and if you like to walk like myself you can probably reach any Manhattan point by foot, which is a pretty nice way to see the city inmy opinion.Rooms were also very good. I took a few classes in NY and everytime I got back to the hotel I felt really comfortable. You have al that nice common stuff like pay per view movies, cable, safe, nice shower, and even a coffee maker. It is very spacious and some views are great.The Internet service is very fast, and easy to use. I used it with cables, so I can't comment on the wi-fi. Great bed, good workdesk, and overall a very spacious room, especially for NYC. My room was way bigger than in the other Marriott I stayed in the city once. The name escapes me now (sorry everybody) but it is a very nice hotel close to Times Square too. The gym seems like something from the future. There are flat screen Tvs so you can walk while listening to TV. You have a view of Times Square from there, and lots of equipment. Some were a little unusual to me since I'm more used to just lifting free weights, but it was a nice experience, and 24/7 if I recall correctly.Cleanliness was OK. My first service complain is actually about the housekeeping services. I've spend a lot of time studying and I didn't make much of a mess in the room, so I was fine with having a lot of timw without housekeeping and the privacy to let my things wherever I wanted them with not much concern. They would call me because they have some policy of having to clean rooms from time to time. It makes some sense (they can check that I'm no terrorist or suicidal guy I guess), but it was bothersome and, when they came, the cleaning wasn't really great. They behind left a bunch of empty soda battles that I had &quot;stored&quot; on the airmoire (is that the right word?) besides the TV since the trash can was small.The Internet was great as I said, except when it failed. If had a connection problem, and I had to make several calls to some center oustide of the hotel (probably outside of US) and then get a guy to fix it, which didn't work. They ended up changing my room after a lot of trouble. At least they gave me a better view, so that was cool.The room service is nice if you're not standing there for much time, or if you sleep at night (it works only until 2 am or something). Not many health options though. My main complain is that they got it wrong more than once. I would ask for a egg white omelet and I'd get a very yellow omelet that was definitely not make of egg whites. The people who delivered the food were all extremely nice. One even managed to remember me from a single brief talk in 2007 (I was istening to a Brazil-Argentina soccer game n the radio and he remembered it). Outstanding!The breakfast in the hotel restaurant (there's ony one for breakfast) may be the best I've ever had. Friendly staff, and if you choose the buffet you'd had lots of variety with any kind of eggs or pancakes, oatmeal, some kinds of fruit, cereal, bagels, and as much oragne juice and coffee as you want. Loved it.The gift shop was very resourceful and, even if you don't want to buy anything from it, you're right at Times Square, so it's hard to feel helpless for anything. It's hard to find a conventional supermarket I guess, but that's a Manhattan thing. The gift shop attendants were also very nice.There are two Starbucks IN the building. One at the lobby (8th floor) and the more assorted one is more shared with outsiders at ground level.I haven't had drinks, sushi and what not, but the lobby has a nice Times Square view and a few eating options.It isn't hard to order pizzas, sandwiches or any kind of meal from the hotel, but you have to go down to the ground level to meet the delivery guy there. I really didn't mind, so that was OK to me.I guess I can also say that NY is NOT the city that never sleeps. I'm from Sao Paulo in Brazil and I feel that Sao Paulo gives me more options at night. If you want to eat really late at night, you're out of luck, unless you want to wander the streets looking for some place. That won't affect any people though.There is also no minibar, so my advice is to ask for a fridge. They will provide a small fridge in the room for 25 bucks (you payjust once for the whole stay) , and it was enough for me to keep plenty of sodas and yogurt.That's about what I can tell you. I emphasized some issues, but I had just a few in like 6 weeks during my 2 stays there. So, overall, you'll probaby be very happy with this hotel. Works for business, leisure, study, whatever you need. PS: They also were able to deliver to me stuff that I bought on-line, even when the arrival was before my check in date (I noticed them, of course)."
144,1881,"Apr 5 2009 	dont go there	I live in NY, and I booked a room for one night only, to have a romantic night with my husband; we were supposed to see a Broadway play. dinner and then stay at the Marquisyesterday we go there to check in and the receptionist tells no, sorry we dont have a room! somebody else wanted to stay longer, and the hotel is sold out. So sorry but you no longer have a room.Nobody contacted me, either by email or phone.They offered to place us in another hotel, but we refused. The guy assured me that my credit card will not be charged, but I do fear that I will be.I just have to wait for the next credit card billI travel all the time, in the US and abroad. It has never happened to me. Neverprobably because they saw we live in the city and we only were going to spend one night..so they couldnt make much money out of us..what a shame!!!"

146,1881,"Mar 31 2009 	Great Location for NYC Theater Times Square Views Dramatic Lobby.	Spent two nights with friends to see a Broadway show, a hockey game at the Garden, and enjoy the tourist heart of Manhattan. This hotel is perfectly situated for all of these activities. Great views of Times Square are possible, even if you don't pay extra for them (we didn't and still had an excellent vista). Plus, the hotel is new-ish which means its standard rooms are decently sized by Manhattan's broom closet standards. The lobby atrium soars 40 stories which puts some additional pzazz into things, and the hotel was clean and everything ran efficiently. Although there were lots of tourists and business people in the hotel, I never heard a peep once my door closed and never had too long a wait for an elevator. Registration took only a minute, the restaurant and bar staff people were courteous, prompt and efficient, and I was able to checkout at a kiosk, which took less than a minute to accomplish. My only gripe was with our housekeeper, who accosted us in a nearly impenetrable West Indian accent to complain about wet sheets. It seems one member of our party had sweated as he slept (before we reduced the room temperature). Aside from being rude, the housekeeper should have acted like a professional, kept her mouth shut and simply done her job. Instead, she preferred to embarass us. After her complaint I immediately checked the sheets and mattress thoroughly and found no hint of dampness whatsoever, except for a touch of it along the top of one sheet. I suspect this housekeeper's real problem was sociological, but in any event her issue did not ruin our visit. But unlike all the other staff members I dealt with, housekeeping received no gratuity from me, although I hope this description here serves as an appropriate &quot;tip.&quot;Helpful info: The lobby and registration desk are located on the 8th Floor. You will not find any signs telling you this. If you've never stayed at this hotel, you'll waste time wandering around its rather disorganized, chopped up ground floor trying to figure out how to enter. The hotel entrance is located halfway down 44th or 45th Street, not on Broadway, but you'd never know this until you've stumbled across it once or twice.Elevators are unusual in that you punch your desired floor onto a control board at the front of the elevator bank, which then assigns you to an elevator (they're lettered, if the control board tells you &quot;N,&quot; for instance, you go stand in front of the elevator marked &quot;N&quot;). There are no elevator buttons inside the elevator itself."
147,1881,"Mar 31 2009 	Great Hotel Great Location	All right, I am a bit prejudiced here. First time I have been here for a while, but it has always been one of my favorite hotels and certainly my preferred hotel and location in New York. Intimate and cosy it is not - this is a big international hotel set up to deal with the masses and the hustle and bustle of Times Square is either to your liking or not.I have always liked the atrium which goes up 30 floors or so from reception. The lifts only take a few seconds for the trip and the glass bubble ones are better than most fairground rides but not, I suspect, if you suffer from vertigo. When I used to come you could wait half an hour for a lift, but they seem to have sorted that out with a new computerised routing system. The galleries around each floor used to be open, but have rather been spoiled by the addition of metal guards - this was apparently necessary after three people jumped in the space of 20 months which must have upset the diners at the bottom somewhat.There is a revolving restaurant up top which is great for Sunday brunch. Apart from that there is no shortage of venues to eat and drink in both inside and out of the hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with large safes. No robe, slippers or mini bar though which seems odd. $16.95 a day for the internet is over the top.Not a cheap hotel, but if you can get a deal I would recommend the experience."
148,1881,"Mar 30 2009 	Location Location Location	My first time to NYC and the location of this hotel is one of the best. We were able to walk ANYWHERE from this location. In the long weekend we walked to Central Park and Grand Central Station and it was not that far at all. The prices were quite high for everything but that was expected in NYC. Loved the hotel and the location...well, it was fantastic. The elevators can be a bit annoying if you have height issues! :-)"
149,1881,"Mar 29 2009 	Fantastic hotel Fantastic location - look forward to returning!!	This hotel was excellent and centrally situated in Times Square in the hussle and bustle, we requested a room on a high floor and was given a room on the 39th Floor - which was perfect as there wasn't any traffic noise. We went with my17 yr old daughter and the room which overlooked Times Square was of good size with 2 double beds which had memory foam mattresses, ideal for a relaxing nights sleep after a busy day of sightseeing!! I had read in previous reviews negative comments on the reception area being busy etc., .....well yes it was busy but this is a massive hotel and to us just added to the atmosphere, staff were never tool busy to be helpful :) We didn't eat at the hotel as we wanted to experience the &quot;real&quot; New York which was fab, there are plenty of &quot;Diners&quot; all within close proximity of the hotel. worthy of note is that the price shown on the menu will undoubtly when you get to the till be plus tax......something we found annoying, but will remember for next time! They do also expect tips and one waiter even called out after us that service was not included and were we leaving him something, we took this in good humour but can be very heavily focused on &quot;tipping&quot; . We did endulge ourselves at the hotel, by going up to the 48th Floor to &quot;The View&quot; which is has a revolving restaurant/bar which offers stunning views over New York.....We went in the evening when the city is all lit up, It is expensive to drink/eat here, but it is worth it to take in the breathtaking scenery, so DO allow $30 dollars for this experience (2 cokes and one cocktail) :) We could not fault the hotel or the staff. At all times whilst walking around Times Square (and the rest of New York) at night with my daughter we never felt intimidated or nervous...... We did all the usual touristy things.......Including Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty Island visit - did you know that if you can't afford do the Statute of Liberty Crusie/trip to the island you can catch the Statton Island ferry for free, this offers good views of the Statue of Liberty and Island, so for those on a budget do this :) We did not go for the shopping although we did buy a few clothes, it wasn't that cheap as the  &amp; $ was not too different when we went,. We flew with Virgin Airways from Heathrow and it was on time both ways and the food/onboard entertainment was excellent - I would definately recommend and use Virgin and visit the Hotel Marquis again. We choose to go from JFK Airport to the hotel by yellow cab, this cost us $50 each way. If you want a holiday/break that will offer an excellent location and clean comfortable rooms......you will not go wrong with the Marriott Marquis we would definately stay here again - please feel free to ask any questions should you wish."
150,1881,"Mar 26 2009 	Best hotel in Times Square	This hotel is the best-located hotel in Times Square. Many rooms are available that overlook Times Square and they are up to the usual modern Marriott room standards. We stayed here for a weekend with the kids and they loved the view of Times Square. Upon exiting the hotel, you are in the middle of Times Square and the theater district, unlike some hotels which claim &quot;Times Square&quot; locations but are actually a block or two away. The check-in process was quick, although a large hotel like this could probably see check-in overwhelmed by a large surge on other days. Our room was clean and in generally good shape. The beds were comfortable and the furniture and decor were standard &quot;modern Marriott.&quot; The weekend rate for a hotel in this location was reasonable for New York, but by no means a bargain. If you value location over price, it is worth paying a little more to be here. This is a large hotel and one should not expect personalized service, but we found the staff to friendly and courteous. Also, we got a very quick response to a request for a toothbrush kit when we realized we'd forgotten our son's. This hotel also has a great excercise room which overlooks Times Square and two Starbucks cafes for those who need their lattes. They also have parking, but be prepared to pay Motel 6 room rates just to store your vehicle.The hotel restaurants looked tempting, but frankly, with all the restaurants in Manhattan, I'd look elsewhere for food. Our favorites included Kang Suh for Korean barbecue and the nearby John's Pizza if you want some simple lunch fare for the family."
151,1881,"Mar 26 2009 	The Location to beat all Locations!!	Myself and a friend stayed in a twin double room from March 15th to March 20th. We were over in NYC for the annual pilgrimage for St. Patricks Day. Having stayed in the Pennsylvania (big mistake), the Wolcott (not bad, but to far away from Times Square), and the Milford Plaza (basic, but great location), the Marriott was by far the best. From the very start when we checked in with Christina, who gave us a room overlooking Times Square, to the super cool elevators, (don't believe the previous reviews about them being slow), to the housekeeping staff, everything was perfect. As we do all our drinking in the Pig &amp; Whistle right across the Square on 47th St, it couldn't have been better. It's a good Pub for food, drink, and most of all the friendly staff. Elaine, Kieran, Brendan, etc. Thanks to the Marriott for making it all so hassle free. See you next March....."
152,1881,"Mar 11 2009 	Overpriced Garbage - go somewhere else.	For the price you're paying there are much better hotels very near by. The service is slow, the staff were rude and the food tastless and overpriced. I was there on business and found I just left the hotel to go elsewhere with clients. The hi-speed was slow and unreliable and I had to pay twice - once for the room and once in the lobby - RIP OFF!"
153,1881,"Mar 11 2009 	fantastic location	Brilliant location - right in centre of Times Sq. We had paid extra for room upgrade - 2 queen beds so room was large and comfortable with side view of Times Sq. Friendly staff, Broadway Lounge had fab views over Times Sq. Only slight niggle was lack of toiletries supplied - no shower/bath gel or shower cap."
154,1881,"Mar 10 2009 	Comfortable beds great location busy busy busy!	The Marriott Marquis is located conveniently in the heart of Times Square. We had a great view of all the madness in Times Square from our 34th floor window. Pros: Comfortable beds, large rooms (compared to most NYC hotels), convenient to public transit and theatre district. The fitness room was awesome, with a dozen treadmills facing wall to wall windows looking out onto Times Square.Cons: Wi-fi is not complimentary, it's something like $17/day! The elevators are always busy due to the large size of the hotel, and sometimes there's a lengthy wait."
155,1881,"Mar 9 2009 	Amazing Marriott Marquis	I stayed in the Marriott Marquis with a friend for 5 nights in February and it was brilliant! The hotel doesn't look like much from the outside amidst the bright lights of Times Square but once inside this enormous hotel you'll be very impressed! The lift system is brilliant and makes alot of sense and we were never waiting more than 2 or 3 minutes for a lift. Check in was swift, although the guy at the desk wasn't listening to a word I said and despite telling him that we were paying cash, he swiped my card and then didn't tell me he was putting an authorisation of 185 on it incase of any charges incurred because you pay on arrival. Apart from that, it was fine and we were given our keys and room number. Our room was HUGE! It was a normal guest room with a view of the river. We had two double beds and a huge flatscreen tv, with alot of great channels. The room was extremely generous and I was very impressed having stayed in other NY hotels and paid more for a room half the size. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! I was devestated checking out, I would kill for a bed like that at home and it was so spacious!! The rooms were cleaned everyday and towels were changed whenever we needed them. The only downside was no minibar or refridgerator but we just kept the ice bucket filled and it was fine! Breakfast was included on three mornings of our package and it was so tasty. A great selection and the staff were really friendly. Food in general in the hotel was really good. A little pricey but I couldn't fault it because it was really tasty. Try the nachos in the Broadway Lounge!!The hotel is ideally located and within walking distance to everthing! If you dont feel like walking, step outside and you'll get a taxi straight away. I had a great stay at the Marriott Marquis and would definitely stay there on my next visit to the City (even if its just for the beds!!)."
156,1881,"Mar 1 2009 	Great Location...Great Hotel	My husband and I just returned today from a wonderful stay at this hotel. We used Marriot points to get our room and at first was a bit hesitant on what type of room we would receive. We knew it would probably just be a basic one. Well, when we got there, we received great service from everyone. We were able to check in early and put all our stuff in our room and freshen up. They gave us a room on the 42nd floor! You know in NY the higher the better and we were pretty impressed. The room was very clean and stylish. Huge flat screen TV! Our favorite was how comfy the beds were. Your body melted right into the bed. Plenty of pillows and very comfortable sheets and blankets. The hotel is situated directly in Times square. Smack dab in the middle of everything! It had plenty of coffee shops, gift shops, staff and restaurants, Would highly recommend it."
157,1881,"Mar 1 2009 	One little thing that bothered me..	This hotel was gorgeou and fun, but upon pulling up, we were told that their valet parking was full, and &quot;to try across the street.&quot; After an agitated response, the valet told us that &quot;they had moved a few cars&quot; ([--]) and we could &quot;squeeze&quot; in. DON'T FALL FOR IT! If they say it's full, they really mean they want to trick their gullible customers into parking across the street."
158,1881,"Feb 26 2009 	Good location but the Hotel does not live up to the Marriot Name	Over all we had a good stay. But there were a few things about the Hotel that I did not care for. Since it's a conference center it always seemed busy and crowded. One afternoon it took us 10 minutes to reach the street from our room, most of that was waiting for an elevator. Also the Hotel bar staff seemed easily excitable and overworked. Oh and get this the bar closed at 1am on a Saturday night! 1am in the City that doesn't sleep LOLIf you want to stay right in time square and don't mind waiting for everything because this place is VERY busy... an elevator, drink at the bar or picking up your car then it's a good choice. Next time I will stay somewhere a bit quieter."
159,1881,"Feb 26 2009 	Great views fun elevator wonderful concierge and lush bars...	We stayed at the Marriot Marquis for 4 nights in mid February and had an absolutely wonderful stay. We did have the same problem as the review below - we got 2 sets of tea/coffee/glasses even though there were 3 of us.At check in, we asked for a room with a view but we were told there were none left. With a little persuasion however the receptionist gave us a fantastic room on the 42nd floor. Pulling back the curtains with a great room overlooking times square was a highlight of our trip!The beds are great, the room was cleaned well, and we were supplied with great toiletries. There is also a large HD TV which is great! There is very little noise inside the room and you can pull back the curtains so the bright lights of new york don't enter the room at night...The View Restaurant is a must - even if just for a quick glass of wine. Its a very romantic and special atmosphere.The Lounge on the 8th floor, a piano bar with brilliant views of times square is an added bonus, particularly for those who don't get a room with the best view. The floor has the lobby, concierge, starbucks, theatre shop, gift shop, sushi bar, restaurant and coffee lounge.The lifts - well, judge these for yourself (look at them on youtube). They are BRILLIANT fun, quick and easy to use (although can be a bit slow when people are returning to their rooms around tea time. You can see the gym from the lifts, which looks great fun if you have time to use them! Would not recommend them for people who don't like heights although they do have lifts without a view...but you might feel dizzy on your floor as you can look very high up or right down to the lobby.Will definately return, there is nowhere else I'd rather stay that midtown manhattan in times square where you can get the tube anywhere easily."

Apart from that, the experience was great &amp; i'd recommend a visit to the View revolving restaurant at the top of the hotel. Very expensive but very nice."

162,1881,"Feb 16 2009	'The Little Mermaid'- Broadway adventure	My daughter, daughter in-law, grandkids and I stayed Jan 2009 at this hotel. We were going to see The Little Mermaid, which my daughter loved when she was a girl. I thought it would be fun for the grandkids but I wasnt prepared for how incredible the show would be for adults too! If you like creative and bold Broadway shows with great tunes, dont rule this one out thinking it is only a kids show. Since we were traveling with young kids, I liked that this Marriott was so close to the Lunt-Fontaine theatre but expected noisy and tight quarters. When we arrived, I asked if the rooms had a nice view. The person at check-in replied, in the nicest of ways, sorry but no. Our rooms did have a good enough view of the corner of 46 and Broadway for it to be exiting. The beds were perfectly comfortable; the room was clean and plenty quiet at night. The location could not be beat, especially when you are traveling with young kids. The grandkids were delighted and even at the young ages of five and eight, this was so much fun that I think they may hold onto the memory."

We had a five star experience and if we ever go back, that's where we'll stay!"
164,1881,"Feb 10 2009 	A number one	There's a lot to be said for paying that little bit extra just to be sure you are getting quality and thats just what we did here given it was our first time in New York. The hotel itself is perfectly located overlooking times square and oozes style and sophistication with a constant buzz of business and social guests alike. The check in and check out was by far the most efficient i've ever experienced and given we were checking in at friday afternoon thats a major plus. The staff were helpful and had no problem with a late check out on the monday once we let them know in advance. A stones throw from all the shows and a hop skip and jump from the subway this is the ideal hotel for those who like their little bit of comfort yet want to be in the heart of the action,"

We had a regular guest room, with a view over Times Square. Our room was located on the 25th floor. The room itself was really nice, especially the furnitures and beds. The bathroom had seen its better days, and was quite worn.We stayed for 5 nights, and always experienced the staff as very proffesional, and friendly.We payed about 350$per/night, for 3 ppl in the room. I found that quite expensive, but it was the best we could at at that period.Would definitly recommend the Marriott Marquis!"

This is our 2nd time staying at the Marquis and we love everything about it. We are family with young kids and quite concered with all aspects of a hotel, especially location, cleaningness. We had a deluxe guest room with 2 double beds. Things liked best:--location. Absolutely best location for all the action and excitement at Times Square:*TKS booth right in the front of the hotel, where we bought tickets for The Phantom of the Opera at 5)% off. Long lines for the tickets but well worth it for the savings.*Walgreens within walking distance. We bought water, snacks there after check in.* tons of restaurants/pharmacies/bakeries for every budget on 7th Ave and Times Square. Our fav is Cranberry Deli and Cafe on 45th between 6 and 7 ave. Great varieties. We ate there for breakfast and dinner. Buffets for hot/cold/veg, fruits are $7.5/lb. Their 2nd floor dinning room has a huge flat screen tv, never crowded while we ate there. Also ate lunch at a Mexican restruant (forgot the name already) next to Times Square Deli Cafe at 45th W. The server brought warm tortilla chips with sausa while we were looking at the menus. Great food at good prices. We spent $88.90 for 3 adults, 2 hungry teenagers, and 2 little kids.--rooms. The room is good sized, clean, with views of the city. Bathroom has granite counter, nice fluffy towels, large mirror. Bed are very comfortable, nice sheets, down feather pillows.--8th floor at the Marquis is for check in. Our check in check out is effortless. Front desk people are nice and courteous. --Atrium at 8th floor. Best place to sit down and relax. Large sitting areas with shops around (Starbucks, etc), and clean restrooms (important for those little ones who always announce their urgency unexpectedly).Things disliked:--almost none...except our call requesting for extra towels was answered but not fulfilled.--bathroom exhaust fan not working, so mirror got frosty soon when we start showers. Later we simply left the bathroom door open so we could see in the mirror when brushing teeth.Overalll we had a great time again in NYC staying at the Marquis again. We bought the all-around hop-on hop-off double decker bus tours. Absolutely best value to see Mannhattan. It also includes the Circle Line cruise ($5 taxi ride from TD) which we got on at 10 am. ...got to see where the airplane landed in the Hudson river a few weeks ago....not far from the pier at all. One more thing: we went to Hell's Kitchen Flea market on Sun..not worth it....just my personal opinion. it's a $4.5 taxi ride from Marquis because our littke ones didn't feel like walking. There're not many vendors that day (and it's a sping like 56F Feb morning). Things are overpriced even to a bargainer like me. i.g. beat up old matchbox/hot wheel toy cars are $5 for 2 !!! My son happens to be a collector of them..and I've been buying them for years. They are $1 each if bought brand new and less than that if you buy them in sets. You got the idea. I did manage to buy some nice scarfs and hats/gloves for everyone in the family. That's it folks. Thanks for reading."
167,1881,"Feb 9 2009 	great room wonderful staff convenient location guest friendly	Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations. We arrived 3 hours before check in time and not only was a room ready but we were given an upgrade to a huge, corner room on a higher floor with great views extending to the Hudson river. The room was very quiet, comfortable and clean. The location is excellent - central, easy to commute and of course ideal for theater going and dining. On the day of our departure, my husband got a severe migraine and to accommodate his needs we were allowed a 3 hour late check out time which helped his recovery. All this, extended in a friendly manner which made our experience very positive. We will definitely be back and recommend it to others."
168,1881,"Feb 8 2009 	Great hotelGreat time!	Stayed for one night Feb 7 to Feb 8. The hotel staff couldn't have been friendlier despite having so many people to service being a huge hotel. As far as location, it can't get much better. I enjoyed staying in the heart of Times Square with all of its sights and endless energy. The only downer was the price for parking.. Expensive for my liking but what are you going to do. We were within walking distance of the August Wilson theater where we saw Jersey Boys. Great play by the way! We also walked over to Trattoria Trecolori where we had a great italian dinner.The bottom line is if you are looking for a high quality hotel in NYC, look no further than the Marriot. We are already planning on going back!!"
169,1881,"Feb 3 2009 	Honeymoon in NYC	A wonderful 6 night stay at The Marriott Marquis. A fantastic location - you walk out onto Times Square! Great sized rooms with awesome views of either times square or the hudson river. The most comfortable beds we have EVER slept in! Great concierge staff for such a large hotel and every type of eaterie you could think of (starbucks, bars, restaurantsm lounges and shops). TIP: definitely try the dessert buffet at The View Lounge - the view from the window seats in this revolving bar/restaurant is amazing and well worth the 15 per head with as many desserts as you can eat.We never had a problem with lifts, you sometimes have to wait a minute or so for one to come along but even on new year's eve we were never frustrated by this as the 'in the heart of it' location more than makes up for any wait at the lift shaft!!The only down that we can possibly think of if we are being really picky is that we only got one breakfast teabag per day - but when we asked for some, half a bag full was bought up to our room - they obviously didnt realise the importance of a good cup of tea on a freezing cold January morning!"
170,1881,"Feb 3 2009	Great Hotel	This is a great hotel and the location is fantastic.The staff in the hotel were so friendly. There's a choice of restaurants in the hotel. The revolving restauraunt on the top floor is expensive, but the view is amazing in the evening time. Overall, I would say this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Will definitely be staying here again and would highly recommend it."
171,1881,"Jan 30 2009	Fantastic Location	Really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. My family and I, two young children, loved this hotel. The elevators were great, handled the mass of people very well (weekend before x-mas, was very crowded). Check-in was efficient. Room was ready early (and there was a luggage storage options if it wasn't). And you cant really improve on the location if you want to stay in or near Times Square. Literally right IN Times Square. Room was clean and spacious. Great view of times square. Bathroom was nice and clean. You do pay for this convenience and nice room/location. But there is something to be said for walking out of your hotel into the middle of Times Square, avoiding taxis and driving and having everything within a few blocks. Overall a great experience and hotel."
172,1881,"Jan 26 2009 	This is my new NYC favorite hotel	I travel to NYC quite often and have stayed at quite a few hotels...the Marriott Marquis is now my favorite...its located right in Times Square, which is central to all the NYC nightlife. I make it a point to see a Broadway show whenever I stay in NYC and this hotel couldn't be more convenient. The lobby is on the 8th floor - away from the busy-ness of Times Square. The rooms are spacious and clean, the hotel is well kept and it has the best concierge floor ...a great place to wind down after business meetings and the breakfast is the best! All the Broadway theatres are within walking distance and I've never had a bad meal in any of the wonderful 8th street restaurants...the waitstaff is used to diners who must watch the time in order to catch a show. This is my new NYC &quot;home away from home!&quot;."
173,1881,"Jan 23 2009 	Christmas Lights in New York	This visit was our first to New York. My wife and I were there to see the sights and the Christmas lights. We arrived early, 9:30 am, and were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. The room was a good size and nicely decorated. The room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The best feature of the Marquis is the location. It is right in the middle of the action. It is an easy walk to the Rockerfeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, Museum of Modern Art, and all of the theaters. When we checked out, we put our bags in storage and did some sight seeing before catching a late flight. When it was time to go, the bellboys quickly retrieved our bags and got us a cab to the airport.In other reviews I saw complaints about the wait time for elevators. We thought that elevator system was excellent. You press the button for your floor and the control assigns you an elevator. For the first 3 days of our stay the the elevator was there almost immediately. Our last day was Saturday and the hotel seemed to be busier. You could wait 2-3 minutes for an elevator. The only complaint that we had was the billing. We booked the room in September and the charges went on the credit card immediately. The charge was over $70 more than the cost of the stay. It seemed bad enough to charge for the rooms in advance without adding other charges.The Marquis is expensive but it is a great place to stay on Broadway."
174,1881,"Jan 21 2009 	Fantastic stay at well organized hotel	However already some time ago (april/may 2008), we still have truly good memories of this mega-sized hotel right in the heart of broadway/46th. On the day of arrival weather conditions were poor and we therefore opted for the choice of our room on a rather low level (12th floor, but facing TSQ, what a surpise) instead of the 40th overlooking the river. We couldnot have chosen better and had wonderful sights (day en nighttime obviously). We experienced all over helpful staff, friendly assistance at all times and can recommend this efficient hotel to anybody visiting the big apple although cleaning is below expectation (hair and pieces of torn paper). An absolute must- and this is an understatement - is &quot;'The View&quot; rotating restaurant at the almost top floor with absolutely spectacular views, swift and friendly service during the buffet (lovely, wide range an absolutely top quality all the way!!!!!!), it made us come back 2 times more! We were overwhelmed and for sure impressed which is why we won't stop visiting this brilliant, vibrating, surprising city that never sleeps..... It must be said that in this part of Manhattan we felt a lot safer at many times instead of in various Dutch cities i.e. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht. Need we say more? Go go, go!!! Have fun and have the time of your life!!!!!"
175,1881,"Jan 11 2009	Marriott Marquis could used better security.	Stayed there last night after seeing Billy Elliott. We had a large, clean room with 2 double beds on the 32d floor. It was pricey but we chose to pay for the proximity to the theatre. One major problem. After the show, we planned to order room service dessert but then decided to go to Juniors for cheesecake. It was almost midnight. When we left our room at around 11:45 pm, there was a garishly dressed young woman standing by a door a few rooms away from our room, talking on her cell phone. As we left, she knocked on a door and did not get an answer, which made her agitated as she continued to speak on the phone. As we walked past her, my companion looked back. The apparent escort then screamed a slew of profanities towards us. Later we decided to call a hotel manager; we were concerned that our personal security was compromised. My companion called the front desk when we returned. There was no manager available to talk to her. She noted the lack of security, the inappropriateness of the hotel allowing obvious prostitutes to knock on doors at the hotel. The operator did not apologize or call a manager but promised to follow up on the matter. Nobody ever contacted us. We are not prudish and could care less if someone hires a hooker for his room as long as it is handled discreetly. However, it is not appropriate for a hotel such as the Marriott Marquis, to allow such potentially dangerous interactions and to not respond to our concerns. Thanks."
176,1881,Jan 8 2009 	Bed Bugs!	Our stay at this hotel was unfortunately ruined by the bed bug infestation in our room! As soon as we left the hotel the bites ceased. It was a pity as the hotel has alot going for it. The lifts are FANTASTIC and not an issue at all. The reception staff are courteous and polite. The gym was the best hotel gym we have ever been in with a view of Times Square. The bed was comfortable. Rooms HUGE. Bed bugs spoiled our stay. Will definitely NOT be returning. A pity.
177,1881,"Jan 6 2009 	Perfect Location!	This hotel was fantastic. I was a little concerned by some of the other reviews before booking, considering we were using a very large amount of points to stay for New Year's. We arrived on Tues. Dec. 30, to wonderful and quick check in, and an upgraded room that overlooked Times Square that we requested upon booking. We were not disappointed. Yes, the hotel is quite large, and the lift system could be intimidating, but actually very easy. This was most likely the busiest time being New Year's and we had no trouble whatsoever with waiting for elevators. Even after the ball dropped it only took 15-20 min. to get back into our room. The hotel itself is in the best location. It is within walking distance to everything, and we walked, and walked, and walked until we saw it all. I would not recommend taking kids on a New York City trip, but if you did, you would find plenty for them to do near this hotel. The giant Toysrus across the street alone would provide hours of entertainment with the giant ferris wheel and walk in barbie house. You can be at Rockefeller center in minutes and we even braved the Subway which was way easier than I ever anticipated. Overall the location could not be beat, and the service was excellent. We were comped free breakfast in the hotel restaurant every morning ($70 every day) and the staff were above and beyond helpful with directions, mapping out every detail for us to get from point a to b, and making reservations at whatever our request was. The hotel was very clean, and housekeeping was great adhering to our schedule each day. Had a great and exhausting time trying to see it all. Thank goodness our home base was Times Square. Oh and the best part is you are directly across from ABC studio where they tape Good Morning America, so you can get up and walk across the street and see yourself on TV. Too funny. Enjoy!"
178,1881,"Jan 5 2009 	Great hotel in the heart of it all!	We stayed at the Marriott from Jan 2-3, 2009. This was a perfect hotel for us. It was our first visit to New York, so we wanted to stay central and near everything. This hotel was perfect for us. When we arrived, they upgraded us to a Times Square view with no extra charge! Fabulous. We had a king sized bed that was VERY comfortable. We were on the 27th floor. They wished my husband a happy birthday on check in since I mentioned it in the comments when booking. It was a nice touch. We also purchased a $40 birthday surprise. I added a picture of what this included. We loved the elevators and had absolutely no wait problems with them. All the staff was courteous and helpful to find our way around New York. The subway entrance is very close and convenient. Shopping and Broadway theatres are right outside the doors. The view lounge is perfect for people watching Times Square while keeping warm. Everything to us looked newly remodeled. When we closed our curtains, we had no problem with the lights from Times Square. We couldn't hear any noise unless a vehicle with a siren went near our hotel. I will stay here again when visiting New York! Easy to get a cab when leaving."
179,1881,"Jan 2 2009 	A Big Apple Letdown	As a platinum Marriott card holder I expected this hotel and service to be great. It wasn't. It is over sized and makes you feel like you are in Las Vegas (not the good parts), the lift system means long waits and they are often full when they do arrive. The corridors were dirty with bags of rubbish and laundry left for more than 5 hours on most days. Having paid $500+ a night, the view was poor from the room and the window small, the bathroom in poor condition. Some of the staff were excellent thankfully but overall this is not someone I would stay. If you don't stay in many hotels this will be fine, but a seasoned travel will find this place nothing less than annoying and disappointing."
180,1881,"Dec 29 2008 	Great location but that's about it...	As others have noted, this hotel is in the center of the center in New York City. Located at 7th Avenue and 45th street, you can't get much more convenient to Times Square. However, the MAJOR drawback to this hotel is the elevator system. Granted, with 1,892 rooms in a hotel which encompasses an entire city block, moving people around the hotel is a challenge, to be sure. My wife and I routinely waited 10+ minutes for an elevator at peak times, and close to the same amount of time at all other times. Guests enter their destination floor on a keypad, whose computer system then directs the guest to a particular elevator. In theory, I suppose this is used to consolidate trips, and therefore expedite travel, but in our experience it doesn't seem to work all that effectively. Based on the extreme challenge of easily getting to and from our room in this system, coupled with the fact that street level is 8 floors below the check-in/restaurant/shops level, my wife and I will find another Marriott property in the city to stay at the next time we visit. Even the 1st rate location is not enough to overcome the poor internal transit system, in our opinion."
181,1881,"Dec 24 2008 	Brilliant!!!	Loved everything about this hotel. Fantastic location right in the heart of Times Square. Rooms very spacious and luxurious with plasma HD TV, I-pod speakers, unbelievable view of Manhattan, huge bed etc. Would go back in a flash. Even the lifts are wicked and the revolving restaurant at the top is worth the expense.Very very impressed and will be back next time!!"
182,1881,"Dec 21 2008 	Location - great. Staff attitude - disappointing.	We stayed for 4 nights at the Marriott Marquis Times Square for 4 nights in Dec 08 for a few days away for my grilfriend's birthday. The hotel is ideally located right in the heart of times square - and you really feel like you are at the centre of the earth staying here. It was especially good for us as we were only staying in NYC for a few days and did not have a great deal of time to be finding our bearings. With so much to see and do in NYC it was really good to be at the heart of it.The hotel is very impressive, a typically giant US hotel. However, the staff were very impersonal and on several occasions disappointed us. On reception they could be quite blunt if they were busy doing something and you approached them. We had a problem on check in whereby they actually checked us into a room where there were already some other people's bags in the room! We went straight back downstairs and the lady corrected the checkin and put us in another room, although the view was out the back of the hotel and not looking onto times square as the previous one had been. I pointed out to the lady that having seen the previous room we would like to see if she could find us one with a similar view, and she did. However, the next day we found that our new room had a leak in the bathroom ceiling caused by the torrential rain. We asked maintenance to come and take a look and left them sorting it out as we headed out for the afternoon. I asked them to update reception as to whether we would need to move rooms. Upon our return I asked the guy on reception what the outcome was and he quite abruptly just responded ' ID please' to look up our room details. Then without any conversation or explanation he simply started tapping away on screen and handed us some new entry cards for a new room - no explanation or apology offered, seemingly unaware that this would represent an inconvenience to us. As he had said practically nothing throughout the exchange I made a point of asking 'So we'll need to change rooms then?', but he did not take this opportunity to apologise and simply said yes. So i then said, 'so we'll need to move all our stuff then?' at which point he realised we weren't happy and offered to send some assistance. I told him not to bother himself and walked off.Overall I would say the location is excellent and the rooms generally pretty nice, and from what I gather a good size for NYC. For this reason, I would probably recommend the Marriott Marquis. However, our experiences with the staff did not meet the expectations we had given the price of staying here, and did not go the extra mile when we had problems."
183,1881,"Dec 11 2008 	pick-up the discarded room service carts and trash	I have stayed at the Marriott a number of times and for the first time I have been dissatisfied. My first concern is: food service carts left in the hallway for more than 24 hrs, broken glass in the hallway, trash thru-out the hotel. For the amount of money spent for a room I would expect nothing but the best. I must say that the young woman who helped hail a cab and load our luggage was exceptional. I will look for other hotels upon my next visit.."
184,1881,Dec 8 2008 	Great Place	We stayed at this hotel for one night in summer 2008 and I have to say that it was interesting. Very busy place!!! We arrived by car. You need to go around 1 block to get to the main Lobby. From the moment we arrived we were taking care of well by the hotel's staff. Tipping you must but do not go crazy. Everyone was very nice to us and extremely helpful. Awesome - American breakfast.
185,1881,"Dec 7 2008 	Not what I expected	The view was GREAT! The room lacked.... One of the tiles in tiles in the bathroom shower was broken and the room just looked old. I expected more for $600 a night, but I guess I paid for location and the view!"
186,1881,"Dec 7 2008 	Center of it all	The Marriott Marquis is an attraction within itself in the middle of Times Square in Manhattan. My first visit to the hotel, it was quite overwhelming with almost 2000 rooms and the elevators that you enter after you chose your floor. The amount of meeting space at the Marquis is absolutely huge, considering that it's in Manhattan. There's ALWAYS something going on: morning, daytime, evening. I've stayed at a lot of hotels in the past, and the lobby being on the 8th floor is a small hassle, since the elevators take forever to arrive to the lobby, and the escalators even longer. The staff is very friendly, and there are employees everywhere that are willing to help.My friends and I visit NYC frequently and love trying new hotels in the area, on all different scales. For this big box hotel, we were quite satisfied by the rate we paid, the service we received, and the location at the center of it all. Next time we stay in Times Square, we'll have to make it out to a Broadway show! I would definitely stay here again... try the Japanese sushi bar on the lobby floor!"
187,1881,"Dec 2 2008	Overcharging - Billing Hassles	I was a guest at a private event just before Thanksgiving week, and the banqueting team incorrectly charged my credit card $400 for another table's wine. Although they assured me the charge would be corrected and wouldn't appear on my credit card, indeed I was charged for it. I have spent the past two weeks lost in the quagmire of their service center, accounting and in-house events department - to no avail. I am STILL stuck with a false $400 charge on my credit card. No one is accepting accountability for the mistake, and no one seems to have the authority to correct the error. Meanwhile, the Marriott is lining its pockets with the difference.If not for this billing SNAFU, it would have been an expensive but overall pleasant experience. But this mistake, their inability to correct it, and the labrynth of automated phone conversations (&quot;Press 1 to be connected to...&quot;) and well-meaning but ill-equipped off-site service centers is simply unacceptable."
188,1881,"Nov 30 2008 	An Overly Priced Bar With Unfriendly and Rushed Service	I am writing my review based on my experience of the Broadway Lounge at the hotel lobby:We sat down with a nice table overlooking Times Square. We wanted to order some coffee (I wanted to go for a Martini but it was too early for one) and something quick to eat. The ambiance of the hotel lobby and bar is very nice, clean, airy and I was very impressed with how nice everything look... but that's just the only good thing that this place has.After waiting for over 15 minutes and seeing one waiter running back and forth all over the place, I thought we had to order at the bar. As I started walking that way, the very rushed, unfriendly and sweaty waiter took our order and left. We ordered to cafe lattes and an order of the chicken quesadilla.About 10 minutes later, we got our lattes and about 5 minutes later the quesadilla. I do have to say, the food was pretty good as well as the lattes. Mind you that the whole time we sat there with our coffees and empty water glasses, no one came over to check on us. Meanwhile, I did see a few servers standing by the bar area chatting away and even one of the managers walking around the restaurant but not really doing anything... hum...All of the sudden a crazy man that we saw earlier on the street singing to himself, found his way to the bar and now he is at the piano, playing it rather badly. Another one of the very unfriendly servers was talking to a patron and I asked her to come over and she yelled from 2 tables away: &quot;I will send you your server!&quot; I told her to come over and explained what it was. She left. A few minutes later, a security person removed the man from the piano but not escorted out. My friend actually ran into him in the bathroom (after the piano fiasco) talking to himself and screaming profanities.We left the bar but I am rather disappointed that the personnel here is so rushed, unfriendly, not following through with customers needs and just with a &quot;I don't care&quot; attitude. I have received better service at lower class places and if I am paying $30 for 2 coffees and a quesadilla, I do expect to receive service from someone who cares."
189,1881,Nov 28 2008	The Best Customer Service!!	We stayed here again for the 3rd or 4th time and once again it was amazing! I love this hotel!!! We travelled all night and arrived in the city at about 8:30am. We wanted to just check our bags with the bellman knowing that we would check in several hours later. But the man at the front desk let us check in at 9am!!!! We couldnt believe it. He was so nice and it was incredibly appreciated since we were exhausted. I love this hotel and recommend it to everyone!
190,1881,"Nov 26 2008 	Sweet Hotel	Now being an employee of Marroitt Hotels in the UK we did recieve an employment discount, none the less the overall experiance @ the Marquis was fantastic.We had a room on the 37th floor (room 3721 iirc) which had to of been one of the best views of time square!!Before we booked this hotel we did read mixed reviews (majority of which told you not to stay here) however we took the gamble and had an awesome time and I thoroughly recommend it.You can not check in until 4pm each day. We stayed here from the 23rd to the 25th of Nov 2008 (3 22yr old friends in one room with 2 double/queen beds). There was a Q for check-in which took all of a few moments to clear and we then checked in with no hassle and was told what a fantastic view we had (he was not lying), left our bags with conciege (however you spell it) and went out into times square for a few hours.After arriving back around 5/6ish we collected our keys (no problems no qing) and went straight to our room and our bags were bought to our rooms within 20 minutes.Clean, comfortable, nice decor, excellant view, hassle free (no qing for lifts etc). We had a very spacious room, 42&quot; plasma, ipod player/alarm clock, ensuite, wardrobe, safe, hairdryer and a bog which was all very pleasent.This hotel can be very very very very busy espeically below floor 8 where check in is situated and qing for lifts on the round floor can take a long time (just take the escalators and get a lift from another floor if you want to).The cost of eating and drinking in the hotel is expensive and personally i think a normal person paying in excess of $500 a night here is ludacris but you are paying for the location fact!! We ate here once which was our last night after a weeks break which was at the 'VIEW RESTAURANT/BAR' which is the revolving bar @ the top of the hotel. The views are stunning and you have prices reflecting it a bottle of corona extra was $9 each (all be it we did have a few) and we also had the buffet which they do each night in the bar area which was $30 and very poor/basic e.g salads. Again you pay for the view.I could talk for ages about this hotel but i won't. Overall very good experaince and i suggest a high floor because there is a bit of noise the lower you are but the views are worth it."
191,1881,"Nov 26 2008 	Great New York Location	This hotel, to me, was excellent! It was right in Time Square in the center of all the Broadway action. We really didn't have anything major planned for the weekend, so it was nice to be close so we didn't have far to look. It was an incredible busy hotel and lobby, but I didn't have to wait long to check in or for the elevators. Being so close to Thanksgiving I was worried about the crowds, but it wasn't bad. Our room was on the 43rd floor and the view was amazing, especially at night. The room was a nice size, especially for NYC, and it was warm and cozy on the freezing evenings to look out and watch the city. I would definitely stay here again when visiting the city!"
192,1881,"Nov 25 2008 	Big Disappointment - I'll never stay at a Marriott again!	My fiancee and I stayed here for a fun getaway but were so disappointed by mistakes made by staff at check-in, condition of the room, and customer service in general that it nearly ruined our weekend. We scheduled a 1PM check-in, arrived at 1:30 and found that the room would not be ready until 4 - regular check-in time! We settled our bill, left our bags and returned at 4:45 when we were supposed to be able to &quot;simply&quot; pick up our keys - only to find that the room was still not ready. Stephanie, at the desk, switched our room to another, but failed to mention that it had two double beds (later referred to as Queen-sized by staff, but I have a Queen at home and this is much smaller), not the King we had originally reserved - we would only find this out after waiting 45 additional minutes to get into the room! It took 20 minutes to get onto an elevator alone, and when we got there a housekeeping cart was blocking the entrance. The houskeeper told us it would be at least another 15-20 minutes, so I called the desk to ask how they could give us a room that's not ready? I spoke with Ralph, who said he would call the housekeeper to find out what the problem was. But honestly, how can you blame her? The desk should know when a room is ready for guests! To get another room would have taken too long, according to Ralph, so we waited in the hall, realizing that at this point we would have to cancel our dinner reservations and go straight to our 8PM show. When we did get into the room, that's when we realized it was not a King bed. Another futile call to the desk but there was nothing else available - the hotel was overbooked, actually. To compensate, the best they could offer was a free breakfast (which I didn't want, because we had a special place already picked out), and a call from the concierge to make new (after show) dinner reservations. The concierge, Zoe, did call me shortly thereafter to help make new reservations, (couldn't get into the other place at 10) but said she would check with the new restaurant and call me back. We waited in the room for 1/2 an hour but never recieved a call. We did get to enjoy the view at this point, complete with a dirty butt print in the center of our window!!!! Downstairs, after getting ready and never getting a call back, I went to the concierge desk and found that Zoe was on a break. Thankfully, Alejandra was able to quickly set us up with new reservations. After the show, Chez Josephine's, recommended by the hotel, was mediocre French food at best. The risotto was cruncy, the hangar steak was 3 slices of meat... I get better food at a diner in South Jersey - and for much less than $150/couple (that's with just 1 drink, not a bottle, by the way!) Back at the hotel we were finally able to get 2 free drinks at the rotating bar on the top floor for our troubles. Later, in our room the thin walls allowed us to enjoy the couple next door arguing from 3 to 5 AM. Also, with almost zero water pressure in the shower and a toilet that eats and spits back toiletpaper, rather than flushing it, it's a good thing we used up all our Marriott Rewards points (plus paid $200), because we'll never stay at another Marriott again. The last few times there was always an issue of some kind, and I'm tired of taking my chances.My advice: stay at the W if you want to be in the heart of the city, or go to the Rivington downtown for the same price and an absolutely exquisite room."
193,1881,"Nov 14 2008 	Thoroughly Enjoyable	We returned this week from a wonderful stay in NYC at the Marriott Marquis. We received a reasonable (for NYC) rate from the hotel website. Upon checking in, I mentioned that we were celebrating my daughter's 21st birthday . We were assigned a room with a fantastic view over Duffy Square. The entire hotel appeared to have been recently renovated. The hotel staff provided excellent, friendly service. The new elevator system worked like a charm. We never waited more than a few seconds at the designated elevator.All in all, the hotel contributed to a magical visit to NYC that our daughter will always remember."
194,1881,"Nov 13 2008 	Super expensive but good quality and service	I attended a conference at the Marriott Marquis and decided to stay there for the sake of convenience. Through the conference I got a rate of USD 439 for 4 nights and USD 479 for the 5th night. It is extremely expensive, but understandable due to the location: right on Times Square.The room was clean and comfortable; we even had a side view of Times Square. The conference facilities and lunch provided was excellent.I definitely recommend this hotel if you want to be in the middle of it all."
195,1881,"Nov 7 2008 	Distinctly average but good location	We have just returned from spending 5 nights at the Marriott Marquis. The good thing about this hotel is the location in Time Square, which is a good central location to get around the sights. But the location alone does not warrant the $550 -$650 a night. The problem with this hotel is varied, namely the size of the hotel causes problems and long wait at the lifts. Having &quot;The View&quot; restaurant and Bar on the top of the hotel seems to draw coach loads of people to the lifts especially in the evenings, which gets like a rugby scrum and can take 10 minutes to get to your room from the ground floor. The concierge desk seemed to be having a personal challenge between them to get rid of customers as quickly as possible, No personal touch at all. The rooms are a good size, particularly for New York, but no Mini Bar and the glasses we used on the 1st night in the room were never replaced for the other 4 days we stayed. We eat in &quot;The View&quot; restaurant on the 1st evening of our stay, great view but food was ordinary and overpriced. My recommendation would be don't bother and get some decent food for 1/2 the price!In summary as a Marriott rewards gold holder I have stayed in lots of Marriott Hotels around America and in Europe and this is the worst one. Stay somewhere else and save yourself some money in the process."
196,1881,"Nov 4 2008 	Great Location	This hotel is right in the middle of Times Square and right in the middle of ALL the action. The hotel is MASSIVE and can be overwhelming, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. The elevator system is very functional. The rooms were very nice. It is expensive, but it IS New York and it is in the middle of everything!"
197,1881,"Nov 2 2008	Wonderful hotel in the heart of New York	The Marriott Marquis is located in the heart of Times Square and is at the high end of Marriott's chain of accommodations and appointments. It is easily reached by subway or taxi, and entered through a breezeway beneath the hotel. Elevators lead up to the 8th floor where the main lobby is located (convention rooms fill the lower floors). The elevators are accessed by typing your destination on a master pad, which then directs you to an elevator that is programmed to take you to the floor. Efficient, but confusing to everyone looking for buttons to push.The staff at check-in is quick and efficient, although rooms were not available until 3 pm (people linger until noon before leaving). The room, on the 14th floor, was a corner room with a huge comfortable bed, large sitting area, and large bathroom. There weren't as many windows as might be expected, and there was a lot of wind noise. The room has a 'fridge, small mini-bar, flat-screen cable TV, and in-room coffee. There is wired internet access that keys to your computer, so if you have two machines in the room, you cant' swap the connection. The tub-shower is great, with good hot water and pressure.There are many good restaurants within easy walking distance, and convenience and package stores for drinks and snacks. &quot;Restaurant Row&quot; is a good destination for a wide variety of dining at reasonable prices, it is an easy two-block walk from the hotel. Many Broadway shows are similarly within a block or two, and the TKTS half-price office is just across the street at the center of Times Square.At checkout, allow a half hour for your bags to be transferred to the breezeway if you are ordering a cap. They take the bags in the lobby, and assume that you will linger before appearing to pick them up downstairs.This is a high-end property that is ideally located and appointed. The staff does a great job moving a large flow of people through the hotel, and is eager to help. Recommended!"
198,1881,"Oct 29 2008 	Nice hotel but busy location.	The hotel was very nice and it was in the middle of Times Square. I did like our room, double beds and a nice view. Didn't like the elevators and how much you have to pay for internet! The housekeeper always came early like 8AM. If I had to choose what hotel, I wouldn't stay here at all. It's always busy and the lobby is located on the 8th floor."
199,1881,"Oct 26 2008 	One of the WORST we've stayed at	The Marriott Marquis is one of the worst hotels we've stayed at and does NOT justify the price at all! The room and bathroom were small and old. The shower did not work - all the water came out of the bath tap and not the shower head. It was only fixed after 2 requests. However this did not change the fact that there was no hot water during our stay.The sheets were dirty - it had blood stains on it the first night we got there!! The towels were also dirty - I found hairs on my bath towel (which by the way, is the mere size of two handtowels).The lights were also extremely annoying - there were no master light switch, so at night when you want to go to sleep - you'll have to manually switch off every single light in the room.Elevators were hopeless - had to wait for ages each time to get a lift.Great location - however don't stay here if you want quiet and peace."
200,1881,"Oct 22 2008 	Loved this hotel	We loved this hotel. We had requested a king bed, but at check in were originally given a room with 2 double beds. As soon as I asked about a king bed, we were immediately moved into a room that had one. Our room was excellent. The location is fantastic and we had NO problems with the elevators at all. We found them to be very efficient. We never ate at any of the restaurants in the hotel, but did have a drink in the revolving one and really enjoyed the experience. Yes, it's expensive, but it's New York!"
201,1881,"Oct 22 2008	Fantastic - do not stay anywhere else in NYC	I took a chance and booked this on Priceline. What a great decision. This property is on Broadway between 45 and 46. That means right on Times Square. It is very large and very busy. However, there were hotel staff at every corner directing you where to go - helping with luggage etc. Truly it was the way hotels should be but rarely are anymore. It is 2 blocks from the subway which isn't too bad and the times Square station connects you with almost all subway lines. If you are headed to Manhattan you should try the Marriott. The regular room rate is around 400-500 but Priceline has rooms for about a third of that price."
202,1881,"Oct 21 2008 	Location Location Location	This hotel isn't near Times Square, it IS Times Square. As others have reviewed, this hotel is massive and extremely busy, Just like NYC! We had a corner King on the 39th floor. The room, fitness center, and overall lobby and atrium appearance were excellent. Check in and check out were quick and efficient. Despite the size and activity, rooms were relaxing and quiet. You have access to everything at this location. Theaters, Tours, food, and public transportation. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Now for a total contradiction. I stayed here for free by cashing in some hard earned Marriott Reward Points. The Marquis was the same point total as some lesser marriott's in the area so it made sense. Would I spend $400-$500 a night of my money to stay here? The answer is no. There are some less expensive marriotts as well as other hotel's that would suffice just as well. It is impossible to stay anywhere in Manhattan and not be convenient to transportation, food, and some sort of vibrant area or activity. If budget is a concern don't be fixated on having to be in a specific area of manhattan, you can access everything fairly easily. Also, You'll spend very little time in the room anyway."
203,1881,"Oct 20 2008 	My first trip to NYC - the Marquis helped make it great!	My boyfriend and I just returned from the Marriott Marquis last night and had a great stay! The purpose for our tirp to New York was that we attended Wine Spectator's California Wine Experience event which was taking place at the hotel - so for convenience sake - we decided to stay at the Marquis. Glad we did!Our check in took a little bit, but it was because we had requested a Times Square view but the only beds available were two double and my boyfriend and I wanted a king. So - we opted for a king room that was available immediately that overlooked Broadway. This room was great! We had the last room at the end of the hall (3224) king bed and a little sitting area with a sofa bed. Very roomy! The bath was small and it was a little tough for both of us to get ready there at the same time.The room look like it had been updated somewhat recently - at least with the furnishings, carpet and the bedding - but it was tired in a few areas. There was a large flat-panel TV that we never turned on and a desk and chair if you're doing a little work as well. I think they charge $17/day for the internet - which I think is a bit excessive - but that's just my opinion.The window was on the small side too, but we looked directly out at the Virgin store and just to the right is 1 Times Square where they drop the ball on New Year's Eve. Needless to say, we were happy with the room and stayed even after the front desk called to say they had a Times Square view become available.I suppose I should back up the bus a bit and say this hotel is HUGE! Something like 2000 rooms and you can tell that by going to the elevator bank where there are 15 elevators! Crazy! We never really waited all that long, but there were a couple of occasions where we were jammed into a elevator with too many people - I'm sure we looked like circus clowns getting out of a VW a few times...Anyway, the lobby is on the 8th floor and that's where you'll find a Starbucks, shopping and a restaurant and bar. There is the View bar at the top (or close?) of the hotel and it moves....ever so slowly...but there was a line of probably 30 people waiting and it seemed to be a big hit. We had a few nice drinks but didn't eat so I can't comment on the food. There is also another Starbuck's on the first floor as well.The first floor let's you out in every direction, so it's nice you don't have to walk around an entire block to go in/out. Everything and anything you can think of that you want to see is in walking distance (this IS New York - so bring your comfortable walking shoes!!!!!!) The Lion King theatre is across the street, as is the one that Katie Holmes is starring in now. There were tons of people hoping for a Mr. and Mrs. Cruise sighting - so be prepared for larger than average crowds in front of this theatre!If you go out the Broadway door, maybe you'll get to see the Naked Cowboy! This is where he hangs out (ew!) and there is always quite a crowd around him as well.A quick tip....We had purchased a New York Pass and did the hop on/hop off CitySights open top bus tour - which is a bit corny but it was really nice. We also did the Circle Line cruise to the Statue of Liberty - that was very cool. If you intend on spending a few days going to several sights, I do recommend buying a pass. Our three-day pass got us into several museums, the bus rides, the cruise and the Empire State building - all included in one price. It was very handy.Back to the hotel....They did a great job with Wine Specator event - we were amazed at how quickly they transformed the ballroom spaces. The staff was professional and friendly and it didn't seem like we were &quot;just another event&quot; - so kudos to everyone.Some people have mentioned how busy the hotel is or how busy the streets are by the hotel. Um, this is TIMES SQUARE! If you want a peaceful, boutique-y stay....go to Tribeca. If you want to walk out your door and be in the thick of things....the Marquis is a great base camp for what I'm sure will be a great New York experience!Happy Travels!LisaMinneapolis"
204,1881,"Oct 19 2008	If you want the buzz of NYC....stay here!	I've been to NY many times and nearly always stayed somewhere different. My favourite is probably the Waldorf Astoria but that went downhill after Hilton took over (although I understand it's now on the way back up). I found the Marquis on my very first stay whilst based at another hotel and back in those days the broadway lounge was a revolving bar. Today it's static, still with a great view, but I'll never understand why they introduced a revolving restaurant on the top floor of the hotel from which you can't actually see Times Square! I've recommended this hotel to friends and colleagues so I decided to give it a go myself this time and I have mixed feelings. It's in a great location and you really feel the buzz of NYC staying here. The rooms are modern and large which is another bonus in this town. They come with a coffee maker (also rare) and huge flat screen TVs. Good amenities and two Starbucks in the hotel plus a theatre ticket desk and even it's own theatre....so it pretty much has everything you need in shopping trip to the Big Apple. However, it's a massive hotel so it lacks character, the elevator system has been designed to cope (although some people don't like it, I thought it was fine) and, except for one concierge who was really helpful, the staff weren't that great. If you want the personal touch stay somewhere else but if you want bright lights, big city, this just might work for you."
205,1881,"Oct 16 2008 	Unsafe Hotel. I can not recommend it.	The hotel is an excellent location, with great views from some of its rooms, but you can have this in other hotels in the area without have to stand in an overcrowed hotel, unpersonal and unsafe: anybody can use the elevators from the ground floor to the the rest of floors. As the reception is in the 8th floor, nobody check who is taking the elevators to go to the teather inside the bulding, to the restaurant in the higher floor or...to your own floor and room....It is a really unsafe place.Choose another hotel in the area"
206,1881,"Oct 12 2008 	Its sooo NYC!!	My daughter and I stayed at the Marriott Marquis for 3 nights as the base for our shopping trip. We knew from previous trips that the location would be good but the whole experience was in fact excellent. Friendly staff, nice spacious room with 2 double beds guaranteed at time of booking. Good facilities withing hotel, including very good gym...if you have that much energy...good luck!Easy access to attractions, shops, ticket booth for Broadway shows and subway. An excellent all round stay.Would certainly use the hotel again.Only downside for us was that they wanted $30 per hour to keep your room on passed midday and I thought that was a bit excessive. So we just left the luggage with a very friendly bell boy and headed out for our final days holiday...no problems at all."
207,1881,"Oct 10 2008 	Loved it! Clean and in the middle of Times Square!	I loved this hotel. I was debating others in area, but my mother kept telling me we should stay here to be right in Times Square. So glad we did! It's very large, but very easy to get around. The only thing I did not like was their elevator system. The rooms were super clean and the view was great. The Little Mermaid was right across street. Sushi bar in hotel."
208,1881,"Oct 8 2008	Awesome Hotel	After many trips to New York City, I always wanted to stay at this property because of its great location. I was traveling to the Northeast and decided to spend one night in NYC. The only reason I had not ever booked this hotel conventionally was because of the price.I did however get an incredible rate through Priceline and was lucky enough to get this hotel for a one night stay.I was very excited to stay here and sometimes I set my expectations too high and I get let down. This was not the case!I checked in and requested a view of Times Square. (I'm sure everyone does!) The front desk clerk said it would be his pleasure and told me he would give me a view of where the ball drops on New Years Eve. He was not kidding!I had a magnificent view from a fairly low floor (I think the lower floor was best). The room was very modern and extremely clean. Everything in the hotel was very nice. Obviously, it is in the perfect location for exploring Times Square.My only complaint was that the bar closed too early! I tried to get a drink at 12:30AM and they had already given last call!!!"
209,1881,"Oct 7 2008 	An ""Experience""	Alright, this hotel was very good in some ways, but bad in others. Lets start with the bad. The hotel is extremely large and seems to be an epicentre for what is going on in Times Square. If you like to be in the middle of things, this hotel is fantastic, but if not, it is very crowded. It can be near impossible to get a lift up to your room from the street level because of the hundreds of people trying to get to the times square shows under the hotel. With it being a large hotel, I was suprised to discover the lack of restauraunts. There was one marriott cafe that closed at 8:30 (NOT HELPFUL, especially after wanting as much time out in NY as possible) and an extremely over priced show case restauraunt on top of the hotel, that revolved around in useless circles so that you could see NY, but really you could see nothing. The food served there was probably worth a quarter of the price charged, and had EXTREMELY slow service, which the waiter gave me attitude about and blamed in on another large group. Needless to say, I am an Australian and am not used to leaving tips at the best of times, so this guy was not going well. After that &quot;experience&quot; I left a very small tip and never went back. Be careful as they try to pull the trick of putting an AUTOMATIC 18%!!!!!!! surcharge on the bill if u have more than 4 people. We had 5, so the $500 bill for the trash we ate went up t0 590. Rediculous! Moving on. Being a large hotel, service was lacking slightly, and it took a long time to get anything. Putting that aside, it was a top quality Marriott. The room I stayed in was newly furnished, with new TV and had a fantastic view over times square. Saying that, LOCATION LOCATION BABY!!!! This hotel is fantastc. Right in the middle of everything, walk out the door and Times Square just hits you. A great place. So, to wrap it up. A busy hotel, but to expected in Times Square, bad food in typical marriott fashion, but a irreplacable location and a great room. It definately was an experience I will never forget."
210,1881,"Oct 6 2008 	Beautiful times square hotel	The hotel is beautiful, the staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and the rooms are impeccable in cleanliness and comfort. As everything is with NYC, everything comes with a steep price tag, $7 for a bottle of water, but if you're on vacation, this centrally located hotel is well worth the money. It should actually be a 4 star rated hotel instead of a 3.5. Kudos to the staff and management for being on point, organized, and friendly."
211,1881,Oct 4 2008 	Enjoyed the Marriott Marquis	I recently stayed at the Marriott Marquis before a 10 day Canada/New England Cruise. The hotel has a great location and is in walking distance to Cental Park as well. The room was comfortable. We stayed on the 32 floor with a nice view of the city and part of Times Square. The service was great. The bed comfortable and the bathroom a nice size. The tv was new and had a great picture. I would stay here again if in the area. I would say that I like staying in the Central Park area a little better over the hustle and bustle of Times Square.
212,1881,"Oct 1 2008 	Blissful room service lacking somewhat	we stayed for 4 nights. had a king room on the 22nd floor looking right down onto times square - great! the room was huge, really comfy bed and sheets, cant fault the room at all. i did queue for 10 mins to check in as there was only 1 member of staff on duty (it was midnight) and when we came to check out, we left the bags in the room (having been assured that they would be brought down to left luggge) but when we returned 4 hours later, they were still in the room. To their credit, the situation was rectified immediately. 2 sour points on anotherwise perfect stay. Oh, other than the $9 bottle of stella in the hotel bar, with the barman not even offering to give me the $1 change from my $10 note - rather pricey by any standards.... So it gets a 4 out of 5, i would have gone for 4.5 out of 5 given the option. But given the price (250 per room per nignt), you expect the best , with no excuses. I thoroughly recommend this place, great location too!"
213,1881,"Oct 1 2008 	OK but not great - I was surprized	I stayed at this hotel two years ago and had a great experience. So, this year when I checked the rates ($500/night) I thought  well, its REALLY expensive, but its worth it.I think this hotel has some renovated and some old rooms. The room I stayed in two years ago had everything new in it. The room this year was old and worn-off. The linens on one of the beds were so worn off  there was a hole in a sheet. I was really disappointed  for $500/night its NOT acceptable.The staff was helpful and apologized, offered me free breakfast to compensate for this inconvenience. But this is suppose to be a high-class hotel and I was genuinely disappointed.The location is hard to beat though."
214,1881,"Sep 27 2008 	OK but not great	OK. Very big and nice room. Clean and had everything needed and service was good. However, the place doesn't have any charm. Just a very big and busy hotel. The location is indeed close to many of the things we wanted to see and do, but after a long day walking around the city and seeing the sights I would have preferred a quieter and more relaxing place to stay."
215,1881,"Sep 24 2008 	Best hotel in the world!!	Unbelievable stay, we stayed here as the first part of our honeymoon and it was amazing. Without a doubt 3 of the best days of our lives. Firstly the location is amazing, you step out and Times Square just hits you. Everything is fairry close although some areas you would need to get a taxi to but we decided to walk to most of the places especially the great shops which my wife loved (wonder why!!). The service was topnotch, always helpful and respectful throughout our stay and they met all our needs.The restaurants were beautiful too with lots of choice. I'm sure anyone would be spoilt for choice.Visually the hotel is amazing, lifts were fast and eye catching. Room was beautifully decorated and very spacious.All in all can't knock the hotel for anything, amazing hotel in a amazing location"
216,1881,"Sep 22 2008 	huge	too big, too unpersonal no charm"
217,1881,"Sep 20 2008	great hotel	Hi, just got back to UK from 5 nights at MARRIOT MARQUIS, what a great hotel, from checking in (5 mins) to checking out (2 mins) it was a great experience, we were given a room overlooking times square by just asking for the best they could give at the price we paid. The room was spacious and very clean, and very prompt service whenever we rang reception(dressing gowns,firm pillows etc), i would go back in an instant."
218,1881,"Sep 18 2008 	A great first NYC experience	We stayed here over a long weekend in early April '08. Check in was fast and stress-free (there was a line when we arrived but it moved quickly) and the staff was very welcoming. Our room was ready right away (well before the official check in time), and was clean and spacious, very little to argue with there. There's several food options there if you feel like staying in at any point on your trip -- we ate at the restaurant on the top floor (which was decent but expensive), as well as one of the restaurants on a lower floor for breakfast and the lounge for drinks (again, both were good and the revolving lounge is fun, but both, like many places in NYC, are a little pricey.) The location is a huge selling point for this place and for first-timers in NYC like we were it was a good place to be based (you have Times Square obviously right outside your door, and we were able to easily walk to a lot of sights like the Museum of Modern Art -- but keep in mind that we are both healthy young adults with no children so your mileage may vary.) Getting to the subway from the hotel was also easy. The only thing I can't really comment on is the price of the room, since we were able to stay mostly on Marriott rewards program points and therefore got a really good deal. All in all, I would book this place with confidence and recommend it to others."
219,1881,"Sep 13 2008 	Unimpressed	If you are looking for a relaxing, friendly, classy hotel, this is not the place you should stay. First of all, it is in a very noisy area, with construction everywhere and noise all around you. Secondly, it is not a very pretty hotel. It looks like is should be in Kansas City, not the New York City. I really has no class at all, basically just &quot;casino&quot; carpets everywhere, large unmemorable rooms with bad lighting and a really confusing elevator system that jams up on the bottom floor often. I felt like I was in a really tacky Vegas casino to tell you truth. I would not stay here again unless I absolutely had to. The food was incredibly expensive. For a plate of nachos, two small cokes a ice tea we paid about fifty dollars room service. The melted Velveeta cheese was hardly worth the price. When there was a dispute about the bill, they locked us out of our room without talking to us first. The funny thing was our company was paying for everything and there were credit card issues which we had nothing to do with, and they locked us out of the room anyway. The employees are basically disinterested in servicing their clients, and are just there to collect a paycheck. All in all, a bad choice for a city stay."
220,1881,"Sep 7 2008 	What a Great Stay!	I have returned from a short trip to New York City recently and I must say that the Marriot Marquis was a great choice for our trip. I took my 11 year old son and he, too, enjoyed this trip even though we were not near a beach. The room was fabulous and spacious and clean. The hotel picturesof their rooms on the websites are true to what we had. Our view overlooking Times Square was very scenic--everything that I have seen in so many television images. I found that evey staff member I came in contact with was very polite,service oriented as well as helpful. My only problem I had was not enough hot water for my shower one day, but with so many guests, I was not surprised and did not have the problem any other time. If you like being in the center of activity, walking to venues, and enjoying Broadway, then this is a great hotel for you. It has many guests but I never felt that I was in a hotel of its size. We could walk to all the places we wanted to go or take the subway very easily. Our only taxi rides were to and from the airport. The hotel price is expensive but all the hotels I considered had similar or greater price point and I feel that I certainly got value for the dollars I spent. I would certainly stay at the Marquis on future visits."
221,1881,"Sep 6 2008 	Another great stay!	I go to NYC often, and stay at the Marriott Marquis usually once a year, most recently for 3 nights in August. This was my 5th stay at the hotel and it was another pleasant one. I arrived around 10:00-10:30 AM, and as I expected, my room wasn't ready. I had requested a king bed room. The front desk clerk was very friendly, as were the bellmen and all staff I encountered. He gave me a card telling me when to come back, and also took my cell phone # in case they were able to call to tell me when the room was ready. I actually was able to get in a little bit earlier than they had said, which was good. My room was # 4154, and it was fine. The view wasn't of Times Square, but I wasn't expecting that, as it costs extra. It was a bigger than average NYC hotel room with a comfortable king size bed, very nice flat screen HDTV, with DirectTV that offered many channels (but went out briefly during a storm, which is somewhat expected at times with a satellite). The flat screen TV's must have just been added in the last year, as my stay last year around the same time didn't have one. There was also a comfortable chair with a footstool, coffee table, and sofa, which I think could be pulled out into a bed. There was also the desk with the $16.95 wired internet (billed noon to noon), which worked fine. I've never had problems at this hotel with the internet service. There was also a coffee pot and alarm clock with Ipod docking station. A couple years ago I stayed here, and there was bottled water for free in the bathroom. Last year is when I started noticing they upgraded it to Fiji water and started charging you. In my room it was sort of hid behind the TV, with a note on it that said you'll be charged in full if water is removed for 30 seconds, so be aware of that! I don't even know how much it cost, but I'm guessing it wasn't too cheap for water! I had used the online &quot;virtual concierge&quot; before I arrived, which is a Marriott standard where they offer little extras (for a fee of course) that are in your room shortly after you arrive. I chose this time mixed nuts and root beer, and when I got into my room, it was already there on a wooden tray on the coffee table, a nice big bowl of mixed nuts and 3 nice, refreshing bottles of root beer on ice and two glasses! The hotel's location is ideal. It's right directly in the middle of Times Square, so your right in the middle of all the hustle bustle! The subway is across the street, so you can get on that to go anywhere quickly, and other attractions are within walking distance, like all the Broadway theatres (there's also a theatre right at the hotel), Rockefeller Center (Top Of The Rock is a can't miss!), 5th Avenue etc... The hop on hop off bus is right outside the hotel, and there's always taxis available within minutes right outside the front door. The TXTS half price ticket booth is right across the street also. The hotel is very busy, it's very popular for conferences as well as tourists, so be prepared for that, it's a huge hotel. I didn't eat at the hotel, so I can't comment on that, but I know the restaurants aren't cheap. There is The View on the top floor, which is the revolving restaurant. I don't think I've ever ate at any restaurants at the hotel during any of my stays there. The gift shop is also expensive. There's great, cheap diners all around the hotel, like the cafe at the Edison hotel across the street, or the Evergreen Diner down on 47th. There is a fitness center that is open 24 hrs, I've never used it, but it looks nice from what I've seen. There's also a business center with high speed internet and all other business needs. There's also nice, efficient self service kiosks in the lobby and on the ground floor that you can print your boarding pass out on for free. I think you can also check out on the same kiosk. I'm used to the elevator system, so it didn't bother me. I did see people get confused with it easily though, like just getting in and looking for the buttons. The buttons aren't inside the cars, you press a key panel outside and it directs you to an elevator based on what floor your going to. The lobby is on the 8th floor. I never really had to wait too long for one, I think the slowest it was was when I was trying to get down one time from the 41st floor. You do have to sometimes press the button again. I'll admit I enjoy the elevators where you can see out, it's fun to look out and see the floors as you go buy, and it does move fast and going down, especially from the high floors, your ears may pop! One thing they've added in the elevators since my stay last year was a little TV showing news, weather etc... My first night, at about 3:30 AM, I heard a noise out in the hallway that I still have no idea what it was, and two people talking, it eventually stopped, but I didn't know what it was. It wasn't the fire alarm, I know that much. It was kind of annoying as it woke me up and continued on for some time. I also found a used washcloth between the bed and the one bedside table, it definitely wasn't mine. I don't know how long it had been there, but it was obviously something housekeeping didn't pick up. I also don't know if it was because of the high floor or what, but the water pressure in my bathroom was horrible. The shower was horrible, and practically everytime I flushed the toilet I had to flush it twice because the first time it wouldn't work. It never ran over or anything, thankfully, and it was loud when it did flush, it was just annoying to have to almost everytime flush it twice. This was the first time I had ever had problems like this with the bathroom at this hotel. I had a decent rate, not the best one I've had here, but cheaper than other hotels I priced. I got the best available rate, which has been cheaper in the past for the same time of year. This year there didn't seem to be any good rates for the time of my stay through Marriott Rewards. Overall, my stay was fine, and I will return, as I love the hotel!"
222,1881,Sep 4 2008	A city in a city with great location	Stayed here for 3 nights while attending a conference in the hotel itself. This is a massive hotel - almost a city in itself. The lines at the check in desk can take very long (even for Marriott Rewards members). It can take up to 30-40 minutes for check in if you get there at a peak period.The location is great! The hotel sits in Times Square (and hence many Subway lines). The views from rooms on higher floors are amazing. The service is like any other Marriott. The rooms are large for NY standards. There are 3-4 restaurants and 2 Starbucks to choose from. The revolving restaurant on the top floor does not offer a particularly great view. I forgot my phone charger at the hotel. It was delivered free of cost by lost and found albeit after a slight delay.
223,1881,"Aug 30 2008 	Big Great Location Service Okay $$$$$	This is a good hotel for business, or a quick trip to NYC. It's not a resort, other than the fitness center (which is great), there is not much to do in the hotel. This hotel is big, and the elevators can be slow. Check-in is on the 8th floor and it was efficient. My room on the 38th floor was clean, and pretty good size, with a king size bed and sofa bed. Maid service was good. I did have one problem with the an electrical outlet in the room. I called and reported it in the morning, but it was not fixed when I returned in the evening. Other than that everything in the room worked well. The toilets are loud, and you can here others flush.The fitness center is great. A lot of equipment. The club lounge on the 30th floor is big, and a nice assortment of food and beverages available for reward members or those willing to pay for the access. I had breakfast in their coffee shop one morning at it cost about $100.00 for four persons. It is NYC. The staff is friendly, but the hotel is so big, you don't get the &quot;high touch&quot; service you might find at other Marriott's. Oh, and carry a lot of dollar bills with you because everytime someone does something for you they expect a tip. It is NYC. One last thing. Leave yourself enought time to get out of the city to the airports. It took an hour to get to LGA at noon on a Wednesday. Although, check-in and getting through security at LGA took 15min at the Delta Terminal. Not sure if that's normal, or I just hit it at the right time."
224,1881,"Aug 26 2008	Great central NYC location!	There's no better place to stay if you want to be right in the middle of it all! Smack in the middle of the wonderful chaos that is Times Square, mere feet away from the best of Broadway (including the half-price ticket line), and subway stations. Walking distance to Rockefeller center, Central Park, and other top NYC destinations! Of course this location means sirens and honking taxicabs at all hours, as well as hoards of pedestrians and tourists filling every inch of the sidewalk. Don't stay here if you're looking for peace and quiet, although I must say the windows are fairly successful at keeping out all the noise. The rotating restaurant on the roof is a must-see, even if just for drinks. It's too bad they took out the rotating cafe on the main lobby floor, but the new renovations and additional restaurants are wonderful! Weekend brunch is a pretty good value too, especially since the restaurants right outside your door are incredibly overpriced. Get out of Times Square if you're looking for a more authentic NYC experience. The Marriott Marquis can't be beat though if you want to stay right in Times Square/Broadway!! I've stayed here many times, with family and for business, and I keep coming back."
225,1881,"Aug 24 2008	Great hotel nice clean large rooms...	This hotel is very nice. The rooms are large for NYC - and nicely decorated. Very comfortable/soft beds. Flat screen tv. Hotel staff is very friendly. Responded quickly when requesting rollaway bed and other questions.Elevator system is different, you punch in the floor you would like and it tells you what specific elevator to go too. Ocassionally we would keep pushing to get another one, as the original one would be crowded.Lobby on 8th floor. Good location right at Times Square, although Times Square area is very crowded. Close to theatres, subway lines.Parking for hotel is overpriced, you can find cheaper parking garages across the street."
226,1881,"Aug 24 2008	Great location	We stayed at the Marriot Marquis for our last night in NY. You could not get a better location than this and the hotel is great. The room was lovely (no view onto Times Square though), clean and quiet. Though as with every major hotel chain, be prepared for everything else to cost you extra! Staff professional and helpful, though could do with being a little friendlier - have your tips at the ready or beware! The pod lifts are great fun - but keep your eyes closed if you dont have a head for heights!"
227,1881,"Aug 23 2008 	Marriott Marquis a disappointment	My husband and I stayed there for 3 nights from Aug 17 to 20. Fortunately he was attending a conference there so we had a conference rate of $292 per night which is really good for New York and the location.We were disappointed with the Marriott which is the 4th hotel we've stayed at in Manhattan. Although all the rooms were non-smoking, I am convinced our's used to be a smoking room as you could smell it the second you walked in the room. They should repaint and replace the carpet to get rid of the smell. Size of the room was okay though although the 2 beds seemed a bit smaller than queen - they felt like doubles.We were on a higher floor facing north with a view of Broadway which was nice. The toilets are extremely loud - louder than airplane toilets. We could hear the toilet in the room above us flush every time it was used which is horrible for what's supposed to be a high end hotel. Otherwise the room was quiet. Bathroom was a good size and lots of counterspace. My husband likes to have coffee in the morning and there was a coffee maker and coffee but no sugar or whiteners so I guess it's only for those who like their coffee black.As previous reviewers wrote the elevator system was much too slow at times.Theoritically well-located in New York it is a major hassle to get around. The subway is only 3 blocks away but with the crowds it takes 15 mins to get there. We've stayed on the east side before (Waldorf, Affinia Dumont) and the subway lines are just as convenient and so much less of a hassle to get to. Marriott's location is only really convenient for theatre buffs. Ate at Encore - one of the hotel restaurants for a 'quick' lunch and ordered a simple flatbread pizza. It took 30-40 mins for me to get it - I think they forgot or made a mistake. In the end, I think they realized it was unacceptable and they didn't charge me. Really impersonal hotel - never felt valued as a guest."
228,1881,"Aug 18 2008 	A memorable experience!	My husband and I stayed at the Marriot in Times Square just one night, but it was so worth it! New York accommodation isn't cheap and we took a long time to find anything in a certain budget, after looking at the difference between spending a little more money and the quality and location of accommodation, we thought we'd splurge considering it was only one night.The staff were very friendly and because it was our anniversary, they upgraded up to a suite and sent champayne and chocolates to our room. It was great! The room was lovely, the bed comfy as! Very modern facilities, but the bathroom was a little tired in comparison with the rest of the room.The view in the room wasn't bad, but because we were staying at the hotel the entrance to the revolving restaurant was free, so we went up for a great view and a drink, its a little 'exi' up there and the coffee was ordinary! The bar on the 3rd? floor has a great view and atmosphere too. I don't think you could find a better location in the city, its so central. We walked practically everywhere the next day, except we got the subway down to Wall St and Battery Park. Central Park was the highlight, we went rowing on the lake, and we loved visiting the Guggenheim."
229,1881,"Aug 17 2008 	Marriott Marquis Times Square -Great Location for Tourists	I spent 2 nights this past week at the Marquis. I was in NYC for a training and spent a Wednesday &amp; Thursday night. I got a government rate due to my job so my rate was significantly cheaper than the going rate and I booked directly through Marriott.com.I took Amtrak in to Penn Station and I am pretty comfortable traveling around NYC so I took the subway, 1 stop to Times Square and then a couple block walk to the hotel. The check-in desk in on the 8th floor which was a bit odd, but no big deal. Check-in was far and away the worst part of the whole stay. 3 clerks were working when I arrived, each was busy. A line formed behind me as we waited for our turn. 2 of the 3 clerks were dealing with different problems with the guests. The 3rd clerk finally finished with their guest and told us to wait for someone else, and he walked away. That was really annoying. I proceeded to wait a total of 15 minutes before I was checked in. Too long to wait at 8pm at night after traveling and with luggage. (Frankly, too long to wait any time of the day!) The clerk who checked me in did not impress me with his customer service, but I wouldn't call him rude.My room was on the 39th floor, 2 Queen Sized beds. The elevator was a little slow for me since I was on one of the top floors. Someone has to stay on those floors, though-right? My room was impecably clean. The bath products were Bath &amp; Body Works. There were 4 fluffy towels in my room. There was also a coffee maker which I didn't use.Large flat screen LCD TV was great, got most channels I wanted except no Food Network or Comedy Central. Oh well, not there to watch TV but they are basic cable channels so I was disappointed. The view was of Times Square and I didn't even shut the black out curtains at night. The view was great and the lights did not bother me at all.The bed was comfortable, the pillows were a little bit mushy for my taste, but workable. There was an i-Pod docking station/alarm clock which I thought was a nice touch.The internet was WIRED and cost $16.95/day-at least it should have been wireless at that price! What a rip-off. And it goes noon to noon not 24 hours from when you purchase. I was NOT impressed with that. I like to sit on my bed and do work when I travel as many others do, but that wasn't possible with wired access. I was able to pull it close enough to put my feet up on a bed but that was it. The connection speed was mediocre at best. Again for the price it should have been much better. So that was a little disappointing.The AC was fine, I like the room pretty cool so it was hard for me to tell if the AC wasn't working well or it was me. The room was around 67 the whole time, I would have preferred 65.With my TV on I couldn't hear anyone else in surrounding rooms. There is a Starbucks on the 8th and 1st floors of this hotel as well as numerous restaurants. For $10 I was able to eat a decent Starbucks breakfast each day of my stay as compared to the hotel restaraunt buffet at $28pp plus tax and gratuity. (Welcome to New York my friends!) The cheapest thing on the a la carte breakfast menu was a $10 fruit cup! So Starbucks it is! The room service menu was as expensive as can be expected, but you are in NYC, in an expensive hotel and in the middle of Times Square. There is however a shop on the 8th floor of the hotel, honestly the prices were much more reasonable than I expected in the shop. Snacks, soft drinks and gift items. You can eat for less money in this area, but you really have to look for it. There is a deli on the corner of 49th/Broadway with great sandwiches-$10 for lunch...So all in all the room was clean, I slept well. I don't think I would have stayed here at the $400+ a night rate, but for $210 a night it was fine. Very upscale for foreign tourists and high-end business class. With my little ol' government rate I didn't quite fit here, but that was ok. Very convenient to where I needed to be."
230,1881,"Aug 14 2008 	Had a Great Time at the Marriott Marquis!	We stayed here for one night in August with our 12 year old niece and had a great time!We arrived around 10:30 and they had a room available for us immediately. I requested a Times Square view and was happily accomodated. The staff was very pleasant upon every encounter. The elevator system was great and SUPERFAST....we never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The room was nice.......clean, roomy and comfortable. We often stay in NYC and this room was a decent size by NYC standards. The view was great! The bathroom was large and clean.The location was great for what we wanted to accomplish (show a 12 year old a good time!). It's right in the middle of the action.....Virgin Megastore, MTV studio and many, many theaters within easy walking distance. Yes, this hotel IS surrounded by &quot;lights and people&quot;.......it's in TIMES SQUARE (in prime tourist season might I add!)!!!! Yes, things are not cheap at the Marriott Marquis.......water, room service, Starbucks, etc.. But being that they are located in one of the top tourist meccas in the world, they can get away with it. It's like expecting things at Disney World to be cheap! If you need water and are not willing to pay the price at the hotel, there are hundreds of places just footsteps away that will happily accomodate you! But really, after paying $349/night for the room, what's another $7 for water??We typically do not stay in Times Square when we come, but would stay here again!"
231,1881,"Aug 10 2008 	Great Location but Hotel disappointing	Mixed views about the Marriott Marquis. On the plus side, the location on Times Square cannot be beaten. The elevators are great fun and my teenage son loved them. The hotel is mostly what you would expect from a modern, impersonal city hotel. There was a wait at the check in and the hotel was very busy. I booked a Times Square room, but was very disappointed to get the side of the hotel next to a construction site. A very tall crane dominated the view from our window and so spoilt our view of Times Square. As it was the weekend, so there was no work going on, but from our room it looked as if the crane could swing through our window. We should have been warned about this and offered an alternative. The room decor and the bathroom were somewhat tatty for a hotel of this class and I was suprised that there was no fridge or mini bar. We had a room with two queen beds. One of the beds was extremely soft and so uncomfortable that neither my husband or I could sleep. The other bed seemd OK. I asked if the matress could be changed - they refused saying they did not have a spare and could not swap with another room because the hotel was full. They only offered a board for the bed. My son ended up on the very soft bed- and we had the other, but that's not the point - we should have had two comfortable beds in the room."
232,1881,Aug 6 2008 	Never Stay At This Hotel	its just not very up to date standard hotel. its a2star grade hotel every thing is old even the rooms and bathroom looks like th the 80s hotels i would advice all the tourist with family dont expect to much just very very very little of this hotel. espacialy tourist from asia is a rude shock for us hotel is a ripp off
233,1881,"Aug 6 2008 	Great Location  lousy service  impersonal will not coma back	Stayed in august for 5 days. Location is great if you like to be surrounded by lights and people. For the price paid , I found it to be a low value. Everything takes for ever including elevators , room service , picking up of the phones. Internet in the room has to be paid for. Noon to noon, not 24 hours. For what they charge it should be included in the price for everyone. Room was smelly (I had two rooms and both were) although I must say the air condition worked well. Too many people everywhere in the hotel, very crowded. In such a hotel, where there are so many people and many have to take early flights, there is no room service 24 hours, I had a morning flight and could not order in room breakfast. Not even a cup of tea. The cleanliness of the room was okay when I arrived, but for the days I stayed, they did not clean very well.Some of the staff is rude, while some is okay, but this is not acceptable in a hotel like this. If you want to print emails, you have to go to the bussiness center, pay 8 dollars for 15 minutes of internet and print your emails. This is a total ripoff. They dont even have complimentary water, it has to be paid for, they have a couple of bottles in the room at exhorbitant prices.No mini bar in the room in ahotel of this category."
234,1881,"Aug 4 2008 	Dissed and Dismissed!!!	Make certain you take pictures of your vehicle BEFORE you turn it over to the parking staff. They scratched the back of my daughter's first car, although not brand new with slight damage, and refuse to pay for their damage. Their claims office outright accused us of not knowing the difference of how our car is supposed to look!I may stay at the hotel, but I will never let them handle my car!"
235,1881,"Jul 30 2008 	Great! But skip the restaurant	We stayed three nights at this hotel, and I gotta say - location, location, location!When you get out from the hotels lifts you find yourself right there, on Times Square.Rooms: We had a great room on the 36th floor. The room was good sized, and had a great king sized bed. We had a lovely view over Manhattan, and if we got bored from that, the 50Intch HD-screen TV was also nice.The lifts alone is a good reason to see this hotel, but the room really did live up to the standard that the building sets.The bathroom was a bit out of date style-wise, but it was big, clean, and had great shampoo and stuff, wich is nice.Breakfast: Well, there is none - not included. But New York has one million great places for breakfast, so no truble at all. If you don't want to walk out of your hotel (?), there are some Starbucks and cafees where you can get some breakfast.Service: Great - all the way from checking in - til the room service. The consierge was brilliant, and led us to some great restaurants - outside the hotel.The only downside, if you can all it that, at this hotel - is the restaurant - The View.the food is less then avarage, the price is way over - and you feel as if you are in a factory. the service here is also crap, no smiles, no personal feeling.the view, as the name inclines, is great. But you can see that from the bar upstairs. My advice is - use the bar, skip the restaurant!"
236,1881,"Jul 29 2008 	Best Location in New York	We stayed at the Marriott Marquis Jul 19-22 for $341/night. This for me has the best location in Times Square. Our room overlooked Broadway and the Virgin Records store. The hotel is in the center of everything that we cared for. We walked pretty much to all the places we wanted to visit: Empire State, Rockefeller Plaza, Central Park, Madison Ave., St. Pat's Cathedral, etc. This is our 1st time in New York and with our 3 kids, just loved to be in the middle of everything. The room is regular sized for a non NY hotel-which means it is big compared to an average NY hotel room. We stayed at a room with 2 doubles and a rollaway bed, and the room did not feel cramped at all. There was still plenty of space around. Loved the elevator system!!! We didn't have to wait long for it. We were on the 28th flr and it was so quick to go up and down since you do not have to stop at every floor. Valet and bellhop services are quick, though the $65 daily parking fee for an SUV is spretty steep esp. since there are no in and out privilages. We would definitely stay here again."
237,1881,"Jul 26 2008 	Great Stay! Busy Location!	Just got back from another fabulous trip to NYC and pleasantly surprised by the Marriott Marquis. Upon check-in the staff was very helpful and accommodating by allowing us to check in early after a long red eye flight. Our room was very clean, quiet and well designed. The TV was a plasma HD type on a swivel base for easy viewing. There was also a very nice AV switching device to accommodate portable players. The bed was most comfortable and the shower head was one that covers your entire body without the extreme over spray everywhere. The tub drainage was also well designed so as there was no &quot;standing&quot; water in the tub as you shower.The elevator system was extremely efficient for such a large hotel in that you make the selection, are directed to a lettered elevator which takes you to your floor. None of the interruptions of button pushers or multiple stops other than those who were directed to this elevator. The hotel couldn't be better in terms of location to Time Square and popular sites. Just be prepared to endure the hoards of tourists and loitering do-nothings who plague most big cities. The Concierge and hotel staff were most helpful when asked directions and the bell personnel were quick with the luggage. Absolutely no wait for a cab either. We will most definitely use this hotel for our future stays."
238,1881,"Jul 26 2008 	Loved the Marriott Marquis!	My daughter and I stayed at the Marriott Marquis on July 17,18 and left the 19th (2008). We stayed on the 32nd floor.We loved everything about the hotel. We have nothing negative to report.The room was clean, the staff were kind and courteous, the beds were comfortable and the location was perfect, right in the heart of Time Square. The elevators of course, were fabulous!We would stay there again if we were to travel back to NYC. Thanks, Marriott Marquis!Patty from Bay Village, Ohio"
239,1881,"Jul 25 2008 	Love it hate it!	Huge, soulless, impersonal place; dingy rooms, dated decor; bar often full of hearties from the vast conferences it accommodates ... ... ... ... but I still keep going back - typically every 8 weeks or so.The place is efficient. It's in the ideal location for the various offices I need to get to (and obviously at the centre of the NY action being right on Times Square). Perhaps the main plus point is that the beds are amongst the most comfortable I've experienced - and I do little more there than sleep.  ... ... and there's a certain fascination in watching newcomers to the hotel fail to cope with the lift/elevator system!"
240,1881,"Jul 25 2008 	Good Choice in Times Square	We stayed here for 3 nights using Marriott Rewards points. The rooms are large for New York standards but the decor is just okay. The elevator system was fantastic. We never had to wait more than a minute. The room service is expensive and very ordinary. I would not recommend it. Beware, local calls are not free.There is also no free wireless internet. The hotel is in a great location if you want to be in the heart of Times Square."
241,1881,"Jul 23 2008 	The best	What a great hotel. We stayed here July 14th-17th as a surprise for my daughter who turned 16 the day we arrived. It was everything we were looking for. The theaters are very close, Taxi's drop you off and pick you up under a covered area just for Marriott guests. Shopping really close (5th ave, M&amp;M store, Elements, MTV...) The rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable (I have fibromyalgia so this is really important to me) The rooms are also very quiet. The elevators are a site to see and the system they use works really well. There are about 8 or 10 elevators. You punch in you floor number on the wall before you get into the elevator and it tells you which elevator to go on to get there quicker. They have a conciere service to help you plan your day. We did not have a flight out of NYC until 8:30 pm so they let us have late check out (1:00 pm) and they stored our bags and had them brought for us in the taxi area and summoned the taxi for us. We really appreciated this because we left the hotel around 5:30 (peak traffic time) We went to the View at the top of the Hotel for drinks one night and to the hotel lounge. Great views of NYC and Times Square. Near the lounge area is a store and a place to get Sushi (something my daughter loves) We had a great stay and would definitely stay again for the location and the experience."
242,1881,"Jul 23 2008 	Another Great Review of the Marquis	I picked this hotel after reading the great reviews here because I thought it would be more memorable for my 10-year-olds first visit to NYC. We spent 2 nights on our way to New England. We had no trouble valet parking the car - it was fast and smooth. Someone took our bags which were delivered to our room. I already knew the lobby was on the 8th floor and read how to use the elevators so we were out of our car and checked in our room in 10 minutes. I dont understand how anyone can complain about the elevators  we never waited more than a minute and we were told the hotel was at full capacity. As has been previously stated, you enter the floor you want to go to and it directs you to the appropriate elevator. It works brilliantly.We were on the 19th floor with a great view of Time Square (didnt pay extra). When we travel with our kids, we usually get a suite but our double/double room was very comfortable for the 4 of us. We had two comfy double beds and my husband and I slept with one child each very comfortably. There was a large flat-screen HDTV, a large desk for the laptop and two easy chairs w/ table by the large windows. The tub in the bathroom was huge  I love to take a good bath and this was very comfortable. The room set-up is nice because the bath and closet are separated from the main room so you can change privately, etc. We were amazed at how quiet it was  did not hear any hotel noise from neighbors or in the hallway. Its a huge hotel but it never felt crowded. I didnt notice much security in the lobby and wonder how they keep people out. If I was traveling alone, I might not like this place but it was fine for this trip with family. My husband used the health club both days and said it was amazing. He saw Manny Ramirez of the Boston Red Sox working out which made his day.We knew there was no overpriced mini-bar frig but the room had a nice ice bucket and we kept it filled with ice and sodas/water. You can rent a frig if you want. There is one of those single-cup coffee machines in the roof but I went down to Starbucks (2 onsite) or to the over-priced gift store where you can buy a $2.50 sodait is NYC so you cant let that stuff get to you. I enjoyed a $12 margarita in the Broadway Lounge. Great views and we had good service. There are several grocery stores around the corner on 8th Ave.The foot traffic was typically crazy in Time Square so we often took 8th Ave to avoid the crowds. Central Park was an easy 15-minute walk, Rockefeller Center is 5 minutes and the Empire State 15-20-minute walk. We felt the Central Park Zoo and Amusement Center were over-rated but the kids loved the playgrounds. The location was central to most everything we wanted to do. Checking out was a breeze. We presented our valet ticket and our vehicle was up in 2 minutes. I knew ahead it was going to cost extra for our large SUV but it was worth every penny to park onsite. I stayed at the Trump International last year and spent twice as much and liked this place better."
243,1881,"Jul 20 2008 	Definetly a hotel for tourists in the big apple!	We booked this hotel after leaving the Jumeirah Essex hotel wanting to stay 1/2 of the time near Central Park and 1/2 near Times Square. It's a hotel you must stay at if you're a tourist in NYC. Why? Because there is a taxi pick up area right in the hotel just for Marriott guests. Otherwise good luck getting a taxi in Times Square. Also you have the ticket booth for broadway shows right outside your door for 50% off or the regular tickets right in the hotel. Starbucks is in the hotel which, believe me, is an easier way of getting coffee than finding a place in Times Square. Kevin and Robert, who checked us in, did everything to get us a connecting room since we had two rooms. Great Job! We got a rate that included breakfast, plus pancakes and waffles. Good buffet. You'll leave here not knowing how they run the place with all those people. Concierge polite and gave us directions every time we wanted to go somewhere. It takes a while to get your room cleaned but you can understand why with all the people. Elevator system is confusing at first, but after a while you'll get the hang of it. You push which floor you want and then it tells you alphabetically which elevator to get on. Time Square is really busy if you like crowds and the Marriott Marquis is in the middle of it. If you're looking for great pizza, John's pizza is only a block away and one of the best in NY."
244,1881,"Jul 17 2008 	For The Rich!	My daughter had business to take care of in NYC from 7/3 - 7/8/2008. We stood at the Marriott Marquis. I must say it is definitely an outstanding beautiful hotel. The room was nothing spectular. Thank God my husband works for the Marriott hotels. I got the Associate Rate for this hotel. The room we had was not worth the usual rate they charge. Everything there is extremely priced. I ordered a glass of wine and was charged $15 for a glass. So, if you are not extremely well-off, do not stay here. The view was good. I faced the Hudson River. I saw the cruise ships come and go. The gym is great! The equipment is updated. They give you fruit and a towel to dry off. Bottle water in your room is $7.00. They do have microwaves for free. They will claim they don't but just say you have a baby and need to heat up the formula and you will receive one. You are in the heart of Broadway. TKTS is downstairs in the same hotel. But I must warn you - the line for TKTS starts around 6 am. Please don't get me wrong it is a gorgeous hotel and classy, but if you don't have money to burn then this is not the place for you. If and when I have money to burn, I would stay there again, but it is for the Rich and not for the Middle Class or Poor. But if you have it like that - then by all means, go for it and enjoy it. If you decide to stay there then book a Broadway View. I am glad I experienced it. I would definitely stay there again."
245,1881,Jul 16 2008 	Excellent hotel	I stayed at the Marriott Marquis while at a conference in May 2008. The location was excellent and the rooms were great. I have stayed at severaI hotels in NY; this one was the best. I would definitely stay here again.
246,1881,"Jul 16 2008 	Top Quality	A brief 'me too' to most of the reviews here - it really is a top quality hotel in an ideal location. Our room was spacious, and had an excellent view.I just wanted to mention two things:- the hotel advertises broadband in rooms, but does not say that you have to pay extra for it. We were staying for a week, and could not afford the costs just for occasional browsing for tickets or times- the price of the hotel is quite high: if you don't need a big room (we had two doubles to accommodate our children) you could probably do better"
247,1881,Jul 15 2008 	great location	If you are going to Times Square area this is the best place to stay. Right in the middle of it all. We were able to walk all the way to Central Park. Not that far. Rooms were big. Had 2 adults and 2 kids ages 17 and 12 plenty of room. Prices are high in resturant food ok. Eat at Juniors across the street. Good food and they give you alot. Great Cheesecake. Saw Mary Poppins show it was wonderful. Would see it again. No problems with the elevators. Very fast. Stayed from June 30th to July 4th. People everywhere. Would stay here again. No noise from the street. Were on the 42nd floor. Staff was very helpful and very nice.
248,1881,"Jul 15 2008 	Loved the staff at the Marriott!	We stayed at the Marriot for one night on July 8-9th. We previously, stayed at the Westin Times Square the 4 nights before, but since the Marriot had the best rate for the last night we book there!We checked in around 10am with no problems getting into our room. The elevators were AMAZING! I have never seen such a system and they were really fast! You just punch in what floor you want on the machine and it tells you what elevator to wait for. Loved it!We went into our room 2825, and had a very high view of times square (will add picture). However, you can tell that this non-smoking room was a smoking room in the past. It still had that old smoking smell, but nothing we couldnt handle. Room was nice and comfy and the shower head was amazing with great pressure.As I was staying in the Marriott, I told my family members that I need to write this on Trip Advisor. EVERY EMPLOYEE that we walked by in the hotel, said some form of hello! We were greated and asked how our days was, etc. VERY impressive! I have never felt so welcomed! The location was to die for, right on the doorsteps of Time Square. There was a couple of blocks walk to the subway and Juniors (cheesecake!) is right across the street and it is next door to MTV's Viacom building. Overall stay at the Marriott was amazing and I would recommend it!"
249,1881,"Jul 12 2008 	Magic at the Marquis	I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Marriott Marquis with my family which includes fifty somethings and 18-21 year olds and would thoroughly recommend it as the perfect place to stay for the first time visitor to New York. We all loved the location, comfort and sheer luxury of this hotel. The location, right in the middle of the Times Square area, was ideal for walking to the nearer must-see tourist attractions, such as the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Macy's, the Rockefeller Centre, Central Park and Broadway shows. It was also a dropping off point for the open-toppped tour buses when you want to go further afield. We made full use of a 2 day pass on the Grayline buses to explore Chinatown, Little Italy, Greenwich Village, Harlem, Brooklyn and the Seaport district. One of the highlights of our visit was the night tour - the view of the Manhattan skyline and the bridges at dusk was sheer magic! The hotel also impressed us with the clean, comfortable and spacious rooms and the helpfulness of all the staff we encountered. From the people on the ground floor who arranged the luggage and taxis to the courteous receptionist who organised 3 rooms close together with good views to the chambermaids and waitresses who looked after our needs after exhausting days sightseeing everyone was polite and friendly (and we found the tipping system easy to manage, no-one seemed to expect huge amounts).The elevator system worked well for us, we never waited more than about 30 seconds even on peak times and the views were great.One point - I have seen many tourists asking about taxis and airport transport - we were a party of 5 adults and had no problems in getting a yellow cab to and from JFK at a set rate of 45 dollars + toll and tip. The hotel organised this when we left and also stored our bags for the day as we had an evening flight.We enjoyed a visit to the View restaurant at the top of the hotel - about 8-9 is best to get a full revolution and see the lights come on and the sunset over NY. This, plus walking the Brooklyn Bridge and the night bus tour were our favourite memories of our trip - New York at all levels! We would all love to return, preferably in December to see the city in a different season and would definitely stay at the Marquis again. Hope this review is helpful and enjoy your holiday as much as we did!"
250,1881,"Jul 11 2008 	A pleasant stay in the heart of Times Square	We stayed at the New York Marriott Marquis for three nights over a recent (busy) weekend in New York (in fact, the hotel was sold out one of the nights, no small feat for such a huge facility). We had also considered the Renaissance Times Square, but ended up pleased with our choice.First of all, the hotel is literally in the middle of Times Square, which has its pluses and minuses. On the positive side, nothing can beat the scene--or the view from many of the rooms--of the flashing neon and people. Times Square is an excellent location for tourists because its the middle of the city, with easy access to most subway lines that can take you downtown or uptown. A cab ride to Greenwich Village was about 10-12 minutes.On the negative side, the rush of the crowd right outside the doors does get to be a bit overwhelming and annoying--you've really got to fight your way just to get back to the hotel, even late at night. But for the purposes of our trip, which was a nice getaway (without the kid) for the weekend, it served us well.The hotel itself is rather stunning inside due to the large atrium. Considering the size of the place, most things are efficient--the high tech elevator system works very well, check in moves quickly.Room quality itself actually exceeded my expections. We were placed on the 30th floor (concierge level) with a king room facing the north side of Times Square. The size of the room was about standard for a hotel, which is above average for New York City. The furniture was new and in good condition. There was a 40 inch LG LCD tv. Sofa and bed were all in good shape. The bathroom was not spectacular but the shower was modern. The room had floor to ceiing windows to showcase the view.There were two negatives about the room. The first was a rather musty sort of smell that was vaguely of smoke--now the whole hotel is smoke free. It wasn't overpowering or awful, and I do have a particularly sensitive nose for these things, but I nonetheless noted it. I ended up not changing rooms because we liked the location of it and everything else was fine, but I did give it some consideration.The second negative was light from the atrium (interior) side. The room was remarkably quiet given the location--exterior noise was highly muffled, and even the rooms themselves were unusually quiet for a hotel like this. There was, however, a great deal of light coming in from under the door which made the room rather bright. Now putting something by the door would easily take care of this, but I noted it anyway.Also note that there are no vending machines--however, complimentary water bottles are in the bathrooms. The maid service was unusually good---the room was very thoroughly cleaned each day. There was also turndown service, and all towels were replaced (we took showers in the afternoon after a morning of touring NYC) which was a nice touch.Overall, I would certainly recommend this hotel. If I visited New York on business every week, I may not want to stay here, but for tourists or visitors to midtown, its a very pleasant place to stay which uniquely good views and high quality rooms."
251,1881,"Jul 11 2008 	Awesome!!!	I stayed at the Marriott June 30 - July 5. It was an awesome experiences. The rooms are larger than the Ritz hotels I've stayed at and the beds are even larger. The room are always kept neat and tidy. I found the staff to be quite friendly, helpful and polite.The elevators are efficient and speedy. Never had to wait more than 2 mintues for an elevator and there were never a lot of stops. They are quite similar to those at the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta. My room was on the 10th floor. I did not have a view but that was okay because I only slept on the room. You could not hear any noise from outside the room.I found the area to be expensive but that was expected. I ate at Juniors and Ruby Tuesday quite often. I also ate in the Encore Restaurant on site, the food was very good. I hope next time to eat in the revolving restaurant.Overall it was an awesome trip. It is easy to get around. I used the taxi mostly. I did not take the train although it would have been a lot cheaper. I have taken the trains before but always with a new yorker. Being from a very small island in the Caribbean I did not feel confident enough to take the trains and not get lost, especially when I was told that where I wanted to go I have would to change trains and stations. Shopping is good. I walked to 34th street and took the taxi to 10th and 57th avenue. The most I paid in taxi fare was $10.The Lion King show on broadway is awesome and the theatre is directly in front of the hotel.I would like to stay there again, the only deterrent is the price."
252,1881,"Jul 9 2008 	Great Stay At The Marriot Marquis	My daughter &amp; I stayed at the Marriot Marquis July 1-8 2008. We had a wonderful stay, our room was on the 11th floor with a great view of Times Square!!I booked this room in March on the hotel website and got a good deal. This is a central spot to all of the city. The subways were just a block or so away. The hotel was clean and everyone was so nice."
253,1881,"Jul 6 2008 	Seamless stay over holiday weekend	First of all, let me preface this by saying that I come to New York at least once a year for vacation. I have stayed at several Times Square hotels, as well as The Plaza and other boutique hotels throughout Manhattan. I found the Marriott Marquis to be above average in every single aspect of my stay. I arrived at the hotel at 10:00am, fully expecting my room not to be ready. It wasn't, but they offered me a standard king room if I wanted to check in immediately. Since I don't spend much time in my room, I agreed. They gave me a room on the 43rd floor that looked down on everything in Times Square. Talk about a room with THE view. The elevator system was easy enough to use, and I appreciated the simplicity of it. No worries about kids pushing all the buttons in the elevator. Just put in your floor and it tells you which elevator to go. I never waited more than a few minutes. The glass elevator can be dizzying, but I just closed my eyes and waited till I arrived on my floor!The beds were incredible, and the room was a good size for Manhattan. I had a king size room, flat screen tv, small loveseat, and desk area with plenty of room to navigate around the room. The bathroom was also standard size. There were Bath and Body Works products in the bathroom, as well as lotion and mouthwash. The in-room internet was $16.95/day, which I think is pricey, considering the lower properties at Marriott and Hilton offer it for free, but it's typical. There are multiple subway stops within a short walking distance of the hotel, which is always a plus for me. Times Square is always crowded, so if you are looking for a quieter stay, you want to stay out of that area anyway. I couldn't hear any of the street noise in my room though, and the shades did an excellent job of blocking out the light. I did not have any problems with this stay, and I could certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a consistent hotel in the middle of everything."
254,1881,"Jul 5 2008 	Fantastic location beautiful hotel	What a magical place! Right in the heart of Times Square theater district, this place is outstanding, even if a bit pricey. It has a whimsical, yet classic decor and color scheme. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever encountered in my travels, and service throughout the hotel was first class. With a view of Broadway from high up, the best elevator system I've ever seen, staying at the Marquis was an unforgettable experience and worth the big splurge! I probably won't ever go back because it's expensive, but it's the perfect spot for a business trip or a romantic getaway!"
255,1881,"Jul 4 2008 	Great hotel	We stayed in the Marquis the day after new year's eve. When we entered, we were amazed by the great looking hotel and this would only continue during our stay. Check-in was very smooth and I was happy to be there on associate rate, because the prices are very high. But that's to expect from a hotel located on Times Square. The room was very nice, with a bed as huge as a spaceship. Everything was inside and we had a excellent stay there. The employees were very friendly and the restaurant, which was suggested by the concierge to have breakfast, was excellent!The best feature of the hotel is it's location. Times Square is an amazing place to be and to explore the city from. All together an amazing hotel in the centre of NYC!"
256,1881,"Jul 4 2008 	Broadway's Best!	I just stayed at the Marriott Marquis from June 26 - July 2. I couldn't have been more pleased with the location, service, or amenities. I Highly recommend this hotel for families or anyone who is primarily visiting to see Broadway shows. There are the best Broadway souvenir shops and the discount ticket window right outside the hotel doors. Many wonderful restaurants and bars are located within blocks. All in all, we had a fabulous stay with absolutely no complaints!Thank you Marriott."
257,1881,"Jun 29 2008 	Huge hotel but surprisingly good.	Given the size of this hotel I must admit that I was unsure whether they could keep a good standard overall. However I found the the hotel surprisingly good.First of all the much discussed elevator issue seemed to be solved very good by them. Their system is unusual - having to select the floor beforehand and then being assigned to an elevator - but it worked very well. No long waiting and once in the elevator not many stops. Very good solution to what must be a challenge for them. The location is excellent - right in the middle of it all. At least if that's what one is looking for. Personally I might chose a hotel in a location a little bit off track again next time. But certainly you can't get much close to the hustle and bustle that Times Square is, if that's what you are looking for.The room was very good. Large, well maintained and clean. I was prepared for less given that in a hotel of this size they must be constantly renovating somewhere to keep this standard. Maybe a bit on the downside there was no real view from the room and the upgrade for Marriott Gold Elite was basically non-existant. Probably just to many Elites at this property and they of course want to sell the rooms with a good view at a premium if they can. So no real issue here.I did not try any of the restaurants at the hotel. There are to many great choices in walking distance - especially around 9th Avenue.Finally check-in was quick and efficient but also surprisingly friendly and personal. Again something I did not expect.Overall very high quality and an above average experience - though nothing truly outstanding. I might stay at the Marquis again if a very good hotel in the center of the action is what I'll be looking for."
258,1881,"Jun 28 2008 	The best for New York City	This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at! The location in Times Square was perfect for the hustle and bustle and it was easy to get to other parts of the city. Our room was a corner room and therefore it was HUGE! It had a sofa even and the bathroom was almost the size of a normal hotel in NYC. Our view of Times Square was really something to see and we liked falling asleep to the street sounds. Just about everything was perfect about the Marquis. However, I have two complaints. It is ridiculously overpriced, but so is everything else in NYC and the elevator situation needs to be fixed. Riding the elevator is like playing roulette and when it comes it is often times full."
259,1881,"Jun 26 2008 	Good! Will Come back	Although I wasn't at the hotel all the time, I truly enjoyed the service and the atmosphere this hotel has. Little perks I want to share with any first timers. By the Elite Checkin area, there's a buffer table with little treats for Elite members. I gotten apples, candies and chocolate from there before. If you workout, there's always a bowl of apples near the front of the gym as well.Fruits are always good especially when you eat lots of NY greasy food during the day."
260,1881,"Jun 25 2008 	Great Location	Excellent location - Times Square, a block from subway station, excellent proximity to theaters. Hotel bar had nice atmosphere, great views, but pricey. Great workout facility. Clean hotel, comfortable rooms. Outlet for same day discounted Broadway tickets adjacent to hotel. I found staff to be helpful and friendly."
261,1881,"Jun 23 2008 	Fantastic hotel in the center of it all!	Our stay at the Marriott Marquis was wonderful. We have been to NYC before, but normally stay at the Embassy Suites or Double Tree. Check in was a breeze. We filled out their pre-stay request form. They had the room ready for us at 11 am eventhough check in wasn't until 3 or 4. We had a run of the house king on the 42nd floor. The room was still very large and comfortable by New York standards. The cleaning staff were excellent. All staff were willing to go the extra mile to assist us. All areas of the hotel were extremely clean. Dispite being a busy hotel the elevators were never a problem. The best part about the hotel was the location! You cannot beat it. Close to everything! It was great having the TKTS booth right downstairs. Most nights we went down around 7:00 pm and still were able to get tickets to the shows we wanted. We called the hotel directly and got a $240/night rate for 7 nights. Great hotel! Will definately stay there again!"
262,1881,Jun 23 2008 	Best hotel in New York!!	Amazing!!! This is the only hotel I will stay at in New York. Everyone was so nice and friendly. We checked in at 2 am because our flight came in so late and the check in lady Molinda was smiling and friendly and even sent up a chocolate cake and a present for my birthday in the morning! Huge hotel with the most central time square location. Our room had a great unobstructed view of times square. The TKTS booth is on the ground floor of the hotel. You don't hear any noise from the street though because the rooms start on the 9th floor. Rooms were the same size as most hotels I've been to elsewhere. Not small and not huge. Concierge could have been more friendly. Smiling is free. Definitely check out the coupons at the desk that give you percentages off everything from macy's to toys r us.
263,1881,"Jun 18 2008	Big and Beautiful	The Marriott Marquis is an exciting Times Square hotel as big as the Big Apple and just as exciting. The room was very spacious, easily accommodating a rollaway bed along with 2 double beds. We were on the 23rd floor which blocked out almost all street noise. Rooms are very clean, well appointed, with a large plasma TV. The beds, pillows, and sheets were extremely comfortable. The elevators are outstanding and fun to ride. The 8th floor area also buzzes with fun with good restaurants and great views of Broadway."
264,1881,"Jun 18 2008 	Another Excellent Stay With Some reservations	Recently spent two nights at a discounted &lt;$250/night rate. Corner larger than average room with an unobstructed view of the Hudson. Usual excellent housekeeping, large flat screen TV, comfortable king bed, and furnishings in good repair.Room was ready upon arrival at 12:15 PM on a Friday afternoon.Only reservations: the breakfast buffet which is pricey (we already knew that) didn't seem to have very tasty food. No waffles or pancakes..just kinda tired French toast; OK omelet. Good, fast service however. Buffet at the nearby Crowne Plaza is better IMO.Always stay here since we normally travel to NYC to see shows and the location for Broadway theatres cannot be beat. Nearby Westin and Hilton Garden Inn would be possible alternatives as would the Renaissance across Times Square.Overall will almost undoubtedly stay again since we know what to expect."
265,1881,Jun 18 2008 	Amazing Marquis	When we checked into this hotel we were given a room with atimes square view even though we didn't request it! We stayed on the 28th floor and the room was nice. It was agreat stay.
266,1881,"Jun 17 2008 	Another good review	Just spent 4 nights at the Marriott Marquis and have nothing special to add to the other happy campers. It is a fabulous hotel, very large rooms, absolutely no problem with elevator delays, maybe those reviewers didn't know how to use the keypad. The longest we waited (twice in four days) was 2 or 3 minutes. Most times an elevator arrived in less than 20 seconds. Friendly, courteous staff, spotlessly clean, nice bedding and toiletries. We were part of a business group, and several of those who tried the hotel food were not impressed, especially the breakfast. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't offer our personal opinion. The table service in the Atrium Lounge (bar) was deadly slow, though. Fantastic location if you like being in the Times Square action, we were on Floor 17 and could still hear the sirens, horns, etc, but not enough to keep us awake. If you are planning to visit the Guggenheim, wait until after June 27th. The outside AND inside is under construction for a special exhibit and there are only 2 small side galleries open, not worth looking at.We had good food at Bond 45 (at Broadway &amp; 45th), at Connolly's Pub (ditto), good super-fast breakfast at Cafe Edison (inside Hotel Edison on 46th &amp; Broadway, I think) -- the best oatmeal I ever had anywhere and good pancakes or waffles. Stay away from their eggs and ham, though. You can skip Junior's Bakery right across from the hotel -- both the take-out pastries and sit-down breakfasts were disappointing and not worth the hype. The best meal we had was at The Cancun Mexican Restaurant on 8th Ave between 56th &amp; 55th. Killer frozen margaritas too!If you take the subway, especially down to WTC and Financial District, be sure to ask the booth attendant which train to take. The stop we wanted was closed for construction and we ended up in Brooklyn. The last time we were in NYC was over 20 years ago, and I have to tip my hat to ex-Mayor Rudy Guliani. The difference is amazing. First of all, the people are much friendlier and open than they were before, very proud of their city and happy to direct and offer tips to tourists. There are police EVERYWHERE! We felt absolutely safe. And the city streets are amazingly clean. I can't wait to go back and do the things we didn't have time for on this trip.The hop on/hop off bus is worth the money. If you want a fun NYC experience, take one of those bicycle rickshaws and hang on!"
267,1881,"Jun 13 2008 	Amazing Hotel	I have been to New York before but this was the first time I stayed at the Marquis. It really is an amazing hotel and the atmosphere, size and location really captures New York. We were lucky enough to stay on the 44th floor with amazing views. The room was spacious and clean with a good sized bathroom. The highlight of the hotel for me was the lifts! As soon as we arrived we were shown how to work them and then we entered the glass lift and travelled up the centre of the hotel with views of each floor as you go! It was like a mini fairground ride!The hotel has several restaurants, bars, a theatre and a revolving restaurant/bar on the top floor! Apparently this is the only one in New York and it takes about an hour to do one rotation - with great views.We ate at the restaurant on the 8th floor - delicious pizza and it was great to watch Times Square from above. The View (rotating restaurant/bar) does get very busy - especially at the weekend, so it is worth booking or getting there early.All the staff were really helpful and charming.The location of the hotel is ideal to explore all of New York. With the subway on your doorstep if you want to travel further afield. I really couldn't say a bad word about this hotel!"
268,1881,"Jun 7 2008 	King of Times Square	I have no idea how anyone could rate this hotel as anything except 4 or 5 unless one is expecting something unreal. The Marriott Marquis is a giant hotel right on Times Square. People are everywhere, duh!!! But so are great restaurants, delis, theaters, and shopping---all within ten casual minutes by foot. Buy an unlimited MetroCard for $24 and you get seven days of unlimited subway and bus. One of the major transportatiojn hubs is on 42nd and Broadway, which is 5 minutes away if you walk slowly. BTW, the subway system is fantastic---fast, frequent, clean, and goes virtually everywhere. The maligned elevator system is actually marvelous. Never had to wait more than a couple of minutes. EVER. Two Starbucks on the premises, a huge atrium and lounge to enjoy your coffee or drink and a Junior's Bakery across the street for fancier pastries and &quot;New York's Best Cheesecake.&quot; BTW, TKTS (which is the discount outlet for that evening's Broadway shows) is currently at the Marriott while their permanent office is being renovated across the street. Another perk! Here's a tip--if you like Chinese food, NY's Chinatown is quite good and the cheapest of any large city I have ever visited.If this sounds like a NYC fan talking, it is, but prior to this visit...not so much. I was fully prepared to dislike the city but could not. NYC just plain WORKS and other cities like San Francisco in particular could learn a lot from the Big Apple. We stayed for eight days and every day was chock full of activities and sights---the Metropolitan Museum of Art being a close second only to the Louvre in the world, IMHO. Back to the Marquis...asked for and got a TSq view on the 33rd floor. Beds OK, bath fine and the space very generous by NY standards. Concierges could be a little more helpful but with 2000 rooms, they are overwhelmed on occasion. Never heard outside noise from the street but did occasionally hear doors and drawers slamming next door. Arrived at 9:00 am from SF on the redeye and immediately were allowed to check in! Then on departure, we requested late checkout (another redeye flight) and stayed until 1:00pm. Great service, I'd say. In summary, this hotel is PERFECT for the first time NYC visitor and for everyone wanting to be in the middle of the party."
269,1881,"Jun 6 2008	STAY AWAY!	New York is a beautiful city and Times Square is such a fun happening area, but the Marriott Marquis is horrible. It looks completely different on the website. The rooms are horrible, the carpet smells, the walls have damp, the bathroom is tiny, the view of times square hardly existed. I didnt like anything about this hotel, if you call concierge from your room they keep you on hold for about 15 minutes, if you go to the front desk you queue up for 10 minutes. I really do not recommend this hotel, New York is filled with nice hotels and this is not one of them."
270,1881,"Jun 3 2008 	Perfect location for first time visitor	Stayed here 28th May - 2nd June 08.Firstly elevators...Never had to wait more than a few minutes for one. Very easy to use (type in your floor number and it directs you to which elevator to use). Yes it does get busier at Peak times (when people are leaving for theatres around 7.30pm) but still wait was minimal.Location  Great for the first time visitor (as we were) Right in the hub of everything. And walkable to most tourist locationsESB, TOTR, Central Park etc. Only time we got a taxi was to Battery Park for the Staten Island Ferry and South Street Seaport.Room. Perfect size. 33rd floor, view of times square. We had 2 rooms both with 2 queen beds, ample room for storage of clothes and also of cases (handy to keep them open to start storage of all the things you are going to buy). 2 chairs and table beside floor to ceiling window which gave great views over times square. Iron and board plus hairdryer where supplied. Toiletries were changed every day (even if there were not used) We seemed to get different makes of shower gel, shampoo etc every day even though we did not use it). Hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. Big thumbs up (and big tip) to the bellman who went trawling the very busy streets to find a taxi that could fit 4 very unhappy girls (cause we were leaving NY) with 6 suitcases between us (very productive stay).View bar  Only negative part of the stay. Food in the buffet bar is not that great. But would defiantly recommend going there for a few cocktails and watching NY revolve around you. Spectacular views. But eat elsewhere.there is hundreds of restaurants to choose from right outside the front door. Staff here were great and took the all important tourist picture (us with our cocktails lol)Would stay here again."
271,1881,"Jun 2 2008	Decent	Good hotel. Let me check in early and check out late, front desk staff was helpful. Valet parking was fine, but we had to go around the block b/c we didn't realize what street we could access the valet on. Surprisingly quiet in room for times square location. Expensive, but company paid. If I was paying, would not be staying in Times Square but instead a boutique spot in the village probably.Elevators were efficient and fast, but glass side and speed of drop made me dizzy."
272,1881,"May 31 2008 	One problem after another with our reservation - handicapped travelers beware!	Stayed with several family members at the Marriott over Memorial Day weekend. Booked three rooms (two handicapped) directly with Marriott reservations and fortunately printed and brought copies of the reservations. There was one problem after another with the rooms (correct room types not available, unable to provide any adjoining or connecting rooms, arrival and departure dates incorrect-not matching the reservation). Each person at the front desk seemed to try to fix one problem, then screw something up with the reservation and cause another problem. In total ended up spending about two hours dealing with various front desk personnel. I travel quite regularly with business and have never had such a problem at any hotel I've stayed in. The fact that we paid over $400 per night for such a bad experience just makes it worse. Find another hotel."
273,1881,"May 29 2008	Great location in NYC	The Marquis is right at Times Square. On check in, request one of the rooms looking right into Times Square, Absolutely fantastic! This area of town caters for the tourist in every way so it's crowded and everything (hotel, restaurants, bars, etc) are expensive. For a more local feel, I go down to the East Village."
274,1881,"May 29 2008 	Is it Worth !!!!!!	Place: One of the most talked about hotel when it comes to stay in Times SquareRate: $ 449.00 + taxes per nightType of Room: 1 over sized DELUXE King Corner roomWhat you get: 1 King size bed, work station, one 2 seater sofa, one arm chair with foot rest, extra space for closet, 42&quot; LCD TV, safe box in the room.What you don't get: Shower gels in the bath room, Bath robs, Mini bar or Fridge!!! Free internet in room, any usual welcome amenities for a DELUXE room, any chocolates with night turn down service, free break fast in the room or in the coffee shop. Fax machine.In fact after paying $499 + taxes, you have to ask reception if you can have shower gel in your bathroom. As per housekeeping they keep them in rooms of higher floor only. (ours was on 18th ).Hotel says, there are no more fridges / mini bars in any of the room!!!! so the huge wooden cupboard having the fridge and big old fashioned TV is now just a piece of decoration and occupying space in your room with the 42&quot; LCD TV placed on top of it !!! At 2300 hrs called business center to send concierge to collect a paper to fax, was informed, sorry there's no concierge services at that time!!!!Probably my last stay at this Marriott property as its not worth spending $499.00 for just to be in the middle of Times Square without having even proper bathroom amenities."
275,1881,"May 27 2008 	Big Hotel Big Price	You can't get any more smack in the middle of Times Square than this. If you like a big, big hotel with lots of hub-bub you'll love the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. The Broadway Lounge on the lobby level looks over Times Square and is a fun place to have a drink even if you're not staying there. The staff was courteous and helpful on all levels. The business center has complimentary computer access to print boarding passes. I had stayed here once before when the elevators were a nightmare, but no more - I never waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator no matter what time of day. Personally, I prefer a smaller, quieter hotel, but I stayed there on business and it was convenient to where I needed to be and I received a special rate through the show I was attending - but it was still very expensive. The rooms no longer have mini-bars, but I requested an extra ice bucket to keep a couple things cold. It was slightly inconvenient to have to refill the ice each morning &amp; evening (would have been more so if I'd not been reasonably close to the ice machine). I was in room 1656 which was large and comfortably appointed; the bed was comfortable. On a minor note, the bathroom did not have a magnifying mirror - a nice accessory I have come to appreciate. The biggest drawback was that the walls were thin and I had noisy neighbors - on both sides - each night. I could literally understand conversations."
276,1881,"May 24 2008 	nice but overpriced....!	Being a new yorker all my life, and now living in tampa for the last 4 years... it was a 'STICKER PRICE' shock of how expensive hotels are in the big apple. I was there for a conference for two nights... just a standard room on the 41st. floor, no breakast included, no free bottle of water, price $479 a night.... no kidding. the hotel is a typical marriott, just that it is in times square/theatre district. The hotel is very clean and the very big. The exercise room is state of the art and really nice if you like to work out.. the hotel staff are friendly... (like all new yorkers including myself are!! :) ). The open atrium is very nice with the glass elevators whizzing up and down. keep your eyes open you will probably see someone famous....!"
277,1881,May 23 2008 	In the heart of TImes Square	We were there for a conference. Our room was nice and wasn't loud like you would expect being in Times Sqare. The workout center was great. Lots of equipment and you can borrow headphones if you forget yours. Currently the place where you buy the discount tickets for plays is on the street by the Marriott so it does get a little crowded when you walk out and there are tons of people waiting in line and you have to get through them.The hotel was convenient to everything and overall we enjoyed our stay.
278,1881,"May 17 2008 	Enjoyed the Stay	My daughter and I stayed at this hotel in March (over St Patrick's Day!), and once we figured out where the lobby was, we had a very good time. While many prefer to stay at a less &quot;touristy&quot; place, we chose it specifically for the lights and the location. It is right on Times Square (but not noisy) so getting around, whether by walking, cab or bus, is fairly easy. The rooms are clean, and we paid for a Times Square View, so my daughter could photograph throughout the night. The lobby is not on the ground floor, and there was a staff member directing people to the elevators. We weren't fond of the restaurant (could have been just us), but there are so many choices in the area it didn't matter. We liked that we were able to walk after dark and still have tourist-type crowds around. The gift shop was nice (important for those last minute &quot;what did you bring me...&quot;) and although the hotel was expensive, we enjoyed our stay there."
279,1881,"May 14 2008 	Right in the Middle of the Hustle and Bustle of NYC	Great hotel.....very modern. Especially with those elevators, which by the way we had no issues with. Surprised by the size of the room for NYC. Great view of the river on the quiet side of the building. Staff is not very personable (but I expect that in a major city, it's all about business)We went to The View Lounge (free entrance if your in the hotel, normally $7pp), does not include very expensive cocktails. But the view was as promised. My favorite quality about this hotel is location,location, location. Close to EVERYTHING by bus subway or walking. We already booked this property again for the week of Christmas. I wanted something out of the tourist zone, but with the size of the room and location I couldn't pass the Marquis. Besides we'll have teenage brother/sister with us this time. I'm sure they'll love how hectic it is in this area!"
280,1881,"May 13 2008 	Great stay @ Marriott Marquis!	Booked 4 nights stay at this hotel sometime in January and got a real good rate. Liked that the hotel was in the middle of theatre district and very close to the theatre we went to. Close to a lot of good restaurants like Sardi's, Juniors, Carmines, Bubba Gump Shrimp. Close to Good Morning America, Virgin Megastore, the heart of Times Square.Beds were smalller than usual double bed but we made do. As long as it was clean and comfortable, we were happy."
281,1881,"May 12 2008 	Good New York experience	We just got back from two nights at the Marriott Marquis in New York to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We stayed at the Marquis using reward points. You cannot beat the location of the Marquis, settled right in between the two &quot;Y&quot; intersections at Times Square. Everything you could possibly want within walking distance (we even walked there from Grand Central Station. we took train in from CT rather than fighting NY traffic). The staff was very helpful and friendly, the front desk, the concierge desk, the security staff, the concierge lounge staff and even housekeeping... we always got a have a nice day and enjoy your day from everyone we passed in a Marriott uniform. The previous review complained about the decor, it was a normal hotel decor, most Marriott decors are the same but who cares you are in New York City you should not be saddled in your room worrying about what decade the decor came from!! Our view was fabulous, right over the North side of Times Square looking right at all the flashy billboards, fun to look at at night, and although they were so bright that it always looked like daylight we just shut the curtains and that took care of that.... it was surprisingly quiet in our room on the 30th floor, we thought for sure we would hear hustle and bustle all night but it was very quiet...... only complaint about room was that the windows are in need of a washing, not an easy task in New York City I am sure...One complaint I have was the ticket booth (which I don't think is even part of Marriott, the box offices just happen to have a window in the Marriott) the people there were not very friendly, they did not even seem to want to help us... our questions were pretty much just ignored as the people at the desk joked amongst themselves, we had better luck going right up to the individual theatre box offices... on thrusday and friday nights we just walked up and down Broadway to the box offices and on Thursday night we walked up to the window of &quot;Rent&quot; at 8:00 (showtime) and got 8th row tickets for half price and on friday afternoon we walked up to the box office at &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; around 4:00 and got front row center tickets (actor had just handed them in).... so if you just want to wing it and not picky take a walk and chance the box offices....Overall our trip was fabulous and would stay again at the Marriott Marquis (with reward points of course)!!"
282,1881,"May 11 2008 	Doesn't disappoint. but oh those elevators	We have stayed here 4 times now and still love the Marquis. We had good service from front desk, in lounge, and from housekeeping. Admittedly we weren't there all that long this time so didn't use all services. But nothing beats the 8 fl lounge for nice cocktails, maybe the cheese platter, and a fantastic view of Times Square. You can also get literally ANYWHERE you want to go in just minutes from this hotel.I did call the concierge for show tickets as I was told they can do that, but they forwarded me to a ticket service without saying that was what they were doing. The Marquis is also pretty overpriced. We paid about $550/ni and it is nothing more than a nice Marriott room. But we did have a nice flat screen tv, plenty of room, and a view of Times Square. So we just swallow the cost and enjoy the superb location, nice room, and good service.The only thing is tha tthis trip the elevators were HORRIBLE. We had thought since they put in the new elevator system it was better, but we almost were late for a show after waiting sooooo long for an elevator. When one finally came to our floor we just squeezed in and held our breath.I would stay again. And hope the price doesn't go up...."
283,1881,"May 9 2008 	Total disappointment	I have stayed in many Mariott properties all over the world and while they look a bit standardized everywhere, they are normally quite nice. However, the Marriott Marquis in New York is an exception. The hotel's website praises &quot;The Marriott Marquis sparkles with updated hotel rooms&quot; but frankly: the design is so horrible that you feel like in a 2star hotel from the 80s. Everything in this hotel has just a very cheap appearance, from carpets over cabinets to bathrooms - not to talk about the ceilings in the guestrooms. The corridors look like in a youth hostel, the check-in service feels like the one of a low-budget airline, the restaurant for breakfast creates the permanent desire to finish as quickly as possible... and many more things that are not worth spending my time with.IN SUMMARY: if you like to look at nice things and want to feel good when staying away from home: DO NOT STAY HERE. I certainly will never return to this property."
284,1881,"May 8 2008 	Perfect for my family	We picked the Marriott Marquis for a family trip to NYC because of the location and the fact that I had enjoyed a previous stay here on business. We couldn't have been happier with our choice. The room was quiet, clean, and comfortable. The hotel facilities, staff, and the views into Times Square were great. And the kids loved the place, especially the glass elevators (which were speedy and efficient in our experience). I highly recommend the Marriott Marquis if you want to stay right in the middle of the action in Times Square."
285,1881,"May 7 2008 	Perfect	Four adults stayed here for four nights and had a great time. We came for the Yankee / Red Sox series so we weren't in the room all that much. None the less, the room was spacious and clean. The hotel is centrally located. We never encountered any wait problems with the elevators. I would highly recomment this hotel to a traveler."
286,1881,"May 6 2008 	loved it...	This was my 3rd visit to New York. Everything was great...no complaints. The staff was very friendly. Most rooms in New York are really small. However, the room was larger than most hotels in New York. I have a bad back and beds were comfortable. This is the most central hotel in Times Square. Room service is expensive....$48 for a bagel, bowl of cereal, and pastries. I would highly recommend this hotel."
287,1881,"May 4 2008 	superb place great location	Have just returned home having spent 4 nights at this hotel, could not fault it at all.The staff are all so helpful, very pleasant and nothing was too much to ask. The rooms are well equipped with all you will ever need.This hotel is in a great location and if you want a decent restaurant just ask any membe of staff as they recommended two places to us which could not be faulted.I would not hesitate to use this hotel every time we visit New York.The View is well worth a visit as the views are fantastic whilst sipping a glass or two!Enjoy it, we certainly did."
288,1881,May 3 2008	Beware - price changes on your bill	I made reservations through a travel agency and was given a written confirmation of the price only to find that I was charged $100 more than this. Despite several conversations with the desk managers this mistake was not corrected. The travel agency blamed the hotel--and the hotel blamed the travel agency. The customer was caught in the middle - this was very upsetting and I would not stay here again because of this.
289,1881,"Apr 27 2008	Elevators still drag down the quality of this hotel	This was my third stay at the Marriott Marquis. On prior stays, it was the in-house parking which swayed our choice. On this stay, it was the proximity to the theaters and the reassurance that they had solved their elevator problems with a slick new system. Alas, on a busy April weekend with tons of visitors, the hotel was completely overwhelmed. One is forced to take 8 flights of escalators when the elevator traffic gets heavy, which includes a long &quot;transfer&quot; at the third floor to keep going up to the 8th floor lobby. We usually waited 3-5 minutes for an elevator, and the worst wait was close to 10 minutes as folks were all heading out to the theater at the same time, I guess. Appalling. There was a lot of grumbling among our fellow elevator &quot;passengers&quot;. The hotel has done the best they could with the space they have and the new technology, but we found ourselves still having to strategize around the elevators each time we moved in and out, allowing extra time for the backup. After three days of this, we were entirely fed up.The glamor, glitz, nice rooms, nice service don't count for much when you can't get to and from your room in a normal way. The staff went out of their way to be helpful, but we will definitely go to a different hotel the next time we head for Times Square. This one is just too darn difficult (and gargantuan) to deal with. What a shame!"
290,1881,"Apr 27 2008 	Crazy elevators	My wife and I stayed at the Marriott Marquis for three nights prior to starting a cruise from New York.On arrival there was not a porter in sight and no-one to give us any idea where the main reception area was. The ground floor area around the main entrance was chaos - crowded with taxis and hoards of people. We eventually worked out that we had to get ourselves, and several heavy suitcases, up to the eighth floor. But first we had to negotiate the crazy elevator system!!There is a large bank of lifts but, rather than getting in the next empty car and selecting a floor number, you have to enter the floor number that you want on a wall mounted keypad in the lift foyer, and the display then tells you which lift to wait for. And wait ..... and wait . !! Some guests told us that they had to wait anything up to 20 minutes on occasions. My wife concluded that the system had been programmed by an IT engineer with a grudge against humanity. So having got to the Reception desk our faith was restored. Check-in was swift and courteous, and our luggage was whisked away by an efficient Bell Captain who took us to our room on the 45th floor (as high as the guest rooms go) and made sure that we had settled in OK.Guest rooms are arranged around a vast central open space that extends from the 8th to the 45th floors. Our room was fine  clean and well fitted out, although the view from the window down to Times Square was a little dizzying and not for those suffering from vertigo! The public areas were spacious and bar service was very good. Having said that, we didnt like the lounge areas  they were just too big and too public  nowhere to sit and enjoy ones own private space.Would we stay there again  no! Nothing wrong with the hotel, we just felt like battery hens in a vast people factory."
291,1881,Apr 25 2008 	elevators ruined it for us	Rooms were clean and nice but the elevator problems overshadowed our stay. not enough elevators for the size of the hotel. Average wait for one was 10-15 minutes. We were on the 22nd floor so we had no choice but to wait... We would not stay there again just because of that issue.
292,1881,"Apr 25 2008 	Great Location! Tons to do!	Hotel is located inTimes Square! It was great to be in the middle of all hustle and bustle on the streets while within minutes one can escape to a comfortable, good-sized, quiet, and clean room. Was in town for on vacation with my daughter, her friend, and my wife. They all loved the easy access to shopping. Also it was just a short walk to reach subway stations to get anywhere in the city.Though the hotel eleveators are frequently mentioned as a source of pain at this hotel, I found them quite simple to use. Plug in your floor number and go the elevator designated. Right next to the hotel are the MTV Studios. My daughter and her friend had a great time watching the celebreties exit the building. Quite a crowd was there for the event but they loved it. Plenty of food options nearby - one night we opted for Junior's (good offering of food) and another we picked up a pizza at John's (just two blocks away). The ladies all attended Legally Blonde Two show and it was right across the street.Overall, a very positive experieince."
293,1881,"Apr 24 2008	great for your first nyc trip!!!	well my review will be short and sweet just because we didint stay at the hotel often, just to sleep. we were at the marriot for four days and had a good stay. the rooms were average but most importantly the beds were clean. our room was a pretty good size considering its nyc and that it was a standard room, maybe it was because we had a corner room. this hotel is literally on times square and walking distance to many tourist attractions. we took the tourist buses to see everything around manhattan including ground zero. i am from la and thought i would feel so cheesy in those two story buses but the fact of the matter is that they are so conveniant!!! they stop everywhere an out of towner would want to go. its well worth paying for the 3 day nonstop pass to get around town because its cheaper than cabs and you feel safe. the stops are everywhere and tons of buses that go around. the people at the front desk were very helpful and friendly."
294,1881,"Apr 22 2008	Loved it.	We stayed here for three nights in mid-April 2008. I read the prior reviews on the hotel and knew about how to use the elevators before we showed up. The system is quite slick and efficient. I cannot say enough about how friendly the front desk &quot;At your service&quot; staff were. Both at check in as well as throughout our stay, whenever we had a question or were simply in need of change, we were always met with a willing person to provide service. I called the front desk twice during our stay and both times was greeted with &quot;Good morning Mr. XXXXX. How may I assist you?&quot;The location could not be better if you want to stay in Times Square. To be sure, it's a busy location, and a busy hotel. We expected that. But our entire stay at this hotel was simply better than we expected.We used the Fitness facilities all three days. The fitness room is located on the 23rd floor, and it is one of the nicer facilties I've seen at a hotel like this. Two trainers were there in the morning to assist and monitor, if needed. Towels were provided, as well as water and an apple. The Fitness facility is open 24 hours and simply requires a room key to enter, together with a sign-in.We were unable to access any free internet in the room from the wireless card on our laptop. We had to be in the public areas on the 8th floor to do this. We bucked up and paid the hefty $16.95 fee for high speed internet in the room for 2 of the three nights.Our room was large with a sofa, chair, computer table, and a refrigerator, which we had requested prior to check-in. The room directly overlooked Times Square, although we did not book a Times Square view room. We were on the 21st floor. Price paid was $339 per night."
295,1881,"Apr 21 2008 	Pretty darned good...	Really quite nice. You're paying for the fantastic location, the gym, and the biggest chain rooms I've seen in NYC.The hotel is absolutely massive, but this was never a problem. The check-in lines didn't take more than 3 minutes, and there was never more than a 1 minute wit for an elevator. The elevator system is a bit odd, but anyone with a 3rd grade education should be able to master it on the 1st day. The rooms are typical Marriott (i.e. better than avg.), but for NYC the rooms are quite large. The only downside is the slow-to-respond AC system. I will admit to liking the room to be cold, but this system was positively arthritic.The gym is the 2nd or 3rd nicest and largest I've seen (behind the Dallas and Austin Four Seasons). Tons of treadmills and bikes, and very nice Hoist equipment. The treadmills have TVs and fans, but the TVs block the great view of Times Square just below. It's open 24 hrs, and that's a nice treat.I didn't partake of the bars on the 8th floor as I was on gov't travel, and they don't pay for $15-20 burgers and martinis. However, you're quite close to a any number of good restaurants and bars, as well as delis and liquor stores, in addition to all the rotten tourist traps in Times Square. You're also right by the theatre district, subway lines, etc...In sum, this hotel is right in the middle of NYC. It isn't a Ritz-Carlton, but if you're exploring NYC and not expecting to stay in a palace, this place is quite good."
296,1881,Apr 6 2008 	Huge hotel decent rooms	This is just a massive hotel. Multiple restaurants and 2000 or so rooms. The facility is in a great location as it's right in the middle of the Time Square action.The front desk is efficient yet still friendly. My room for four of us was a bit tight but serviceable. There's not really anything special about this hotel (aside from it's size and it's location) as the rooms are just average.Make sure that you venture outside of the hotel for food as the restaurants are very expensive. There are numerous inexpensive food locations very nearby.
297,1881,"Apr 5 2008	Christmas in New York	We spent five nights in the Marquis over Christmas 2007.The room was huge with sofa, chair, massive bed and big bathroom. It was clean and comfortable. The hotel is typically corporate and business like, but many families appeared to stay there. Whilst it is well located (two minutes from Times Square) it is a huge hotel and its size does remove any real feeling of friendliness.The lifts are a nightmare: a central block of about 15 lifts serving different floors. Expect to wait if there is a large influx of people at one time. We only ate in the hotel once, in the revolving restaurant on the top floor. This offers a buffet which to be honest was pretty awful. However, the views are fantastic so skip the buffet and just go for a drink. It takes about an hour to revolve 360 degrees.There are lots of great places to eat nearby and a branch of Juniors is opposite the hotel for huge breakfasts (the pancakes are good) and wonderful cheesecake."
298,1881,"Apr 4 2008 	Very impressed with the Marquis	I've been to New York many times and have always stayed at smaller hotels, but I was curious about how the enormous Marriott Marquis could warrant the raves here. I had a business conference scheduled nearby, so this was the perfect opportunity to give the Marquis a try. My personal preference is still for a smaller hotel, but I have to say I'm very impressed. The location cannot be beat. The people who work there are uniformly pleasant, well-informed and professional. I had a corner room which was huge, especially by NY standards. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet (of course I was on the 27th floor facing the Hudson River, not Times Square). The elevator system is very efficient and I rarely waited more than a couple of minutes. The Times Square TKTS booth is attached to the hotel. There are airport check-in kiosks and a Starbucks near the reception desk (which is on the 8th floor). Subway, buses and taxis are right outside any of the numerous front doors. If I were recommending a place to stay for a first-time visitor to New York, I would not hesitate to suggest the Marquis."
299,1881,"Apr 4 2008	Amazing bar!	Booked my girly weekend trip to New York via ww.Cityandshow.com who were fantastic, gave travel advice and the rate was very competitive.The Hotel was amazing, just off of Time Square near Broadway. It had great facilities, and was very clean. I would especialy recommend the bar at the top of the hotel, it spins around and you get amazing views of the fantastic city.Avoid using the phones in the bedrooms as they charge ridiculous rates, I paid $15.00 dollars for a 30 second phone call!!Other than that I would strongly recommend the hotel."
300,1881,"Apr 2 2008 	Loved the Marriott Marquis New York	Stayed at this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor.The hotel was fantastic we were made to feel special, nothing was too much trouble for the staff.We had a Time Square view at no extra cost, the room was huge with sofa's and chairs, the bed was huge clean linen every day.We had concerns about the lifts after reading some of the reviews but I don't think we ever had to wait more than a minute for a lift.The hotel was a joy and will definately will be staying there again."
301,1881,"Apr 1 2008 	Best Hotel for tourists in NYC	This is the best hotel to stay for tourists in NYC! You will be in the center of all the excitement and energy that Times Square has to offer. Its conveniently located near the Theater District and within easy walking distance to the subway stop. Excellent restaurants and shopping are also closeby. The rooms we stayed in were excellent, one with a view of Times Square and another with a view of the Hudson River. The staff were very accomodating and friendly. The rooms were large and immaculate. There is also a nice gym within the hotel. It was a bit pricey ($349 per standard room) but worth the extra money I would usually spend because of the location."
302,1881,"Mar 30 2008	Great Stay	My self and my wife, BIL, and SIL stayed here back in June of 2007. THis was a GREAT hotel. I have seen that the rates have doubled since last year. I was hoping for a return stay this year, but we payed 220 a night last summer and now the rates are about 500. I don't understand the drastic increase. The amenities we teriffic, the hotel was extremely clean. All of the staff were helpful and attentive. Just a great overall stay."
303,1881,"Mar 28 2008 	Great View Great location	I took my wife to NYC to see a play for her birthday. We stayed one night at the Marriot Marquis, as we decided to treat ourselves. Great location, great view, central to everything in the theater district. The room was large clean and comfortable. We stay in the city two or three nights a year, and I would stay there every time is the prices were lower. We paid $300 for the night, but you can find deals at other nice hotels in the area for under $200."
304,1881,"Mar 27 2008 	Best birthday ever! - fantastic views in a city?? Your off your head love!	We have stayed in this hotel before... and we were so impressed we decided to go back!!Your experience starts by being dropped off in the very centre of Times Square - and you are taken into the hotel entrance (there is one on either side of the block! - it is that big!)..You are then welcomed by the concierge man who taps in floor 8 on the lift caller and a lift quickly comes to take you to reception...When i say lifts... I mean pods.. going up the outside of a central collumn to the building - when you go up 45 floors (can't quite remember total) it is a pretty amazing view - and will make your ears go funny!!Anyway.. check in was superb.. we had two rooms with Time Square views.. but they were not on the same floor... we said that's fine but the very helpful receptionist.. without saying anything.. made a half dozen phone calls and finally said - your rooms are on the same floor - which was nice!!Anyway.. we were on floor 38 so we wizzed on up this amazing lift system - which really does get people looking up and saying wow (will upload photos)We walked into our room and &quot;WOW&quot; - we had an amazing view looking down &amp; over Time Sqaure (if we looked down bottom right of the window we could see ticket booth and the theatres to give you some idea).We then went out to the theatre.. and came back absolutely shattered (about 4am UK time).. and got straight into bed.. and my god was it a bed!! The best beds i have EVER and i mean EVER slept in / on.Not a lot more to say as we didn't spend much time in the hotel... but they have a great number of places to buy food - including a very handy Starbucks - good for a quick drink and a muffin before an action packed day starting at Macys!If you want to stay in New York i REALLY suggest you stay here. I know wont be able to go back to New York (time sqaure area) and be satisfied by any other hotel (expensive habit!!)..A1 Fantastic!!!OHHH. ps. forgot to say - there also happens to be a rotating restraunt on the top of the hotel (hand uh) that goes around once per hour and gives you views over the river, empire state building, chysler building etc.You can either go in the more expensive formal restraunt or the fairly formal lounge - which has a fantastic buffet (think fantastic platters of food and chocolate fountains!!!)"
305,1881,"Mar 23 2008 	Don't Spend Your Own Money!	This is a great hotel, if you're staying on somebody else's dollar. It's got everything you want - for a price. If you can afford it, go for it. The location is in the heart of Times Square, so all prices are inflated, but the Marriott Marquis assumes most of its guests are business travelers and can spend money like water. I stayed there because of a business convention, so I fit their profile. Want to use a computer at the hotel's business center? $32 per hour. Have a glass of wine in the bar? $13 or more. (In fact, the wine list includes one wine I often buy at home for $8.99 a bottle. They charge $48 for the same bottle.) Yet they refused to honor the credit card I tried to check in with, because it had the name of my company on it, even though they had accepted it to guarantee my reservation. I was forced to use a personal credit card. They can afford to have that attitude because there's a demand for high end service in that location. Honestly, though, I've stayed in lots of of hotels just as good and with a nicer attitude, but at half the price. I'll stay here again next year ... but only if my employer is paying the bill. Next time I'm in NYC (in about three months) I'll stay elsewhere, where the prices are rational and the people are friendlier -- because it will be MY money."
306,1881,"Mar 23 2008 	Exceeded Expectations	Just spent 3 nights at this hotel and was very impressed. We were on the 25th Floor and had the &quot;Stay for Breakfast&quot; rate. Thought this was well worth the money, as it entitled us to a great buffet breakfast, including juice, coffee, pancakes, and waffles in addition to the buffet items. The room was amazingly quiet, especially considering that the hotel is in the middle of Times Square. I am normally a very poor sleeper-but had 3 wonderful nights' sleep at this hotel. Not only was it very quiet, but the beds were extremely comfortable, and the room temperature was good too. The heating system was also very quiet, unlike those in many hotels. Took this trip as a tourist, and the hotel was very convenient to shopping, restaurants, and of course Broadway theaters. Staff was generally good. The hotel is large and modern in design; very striking. Obviously not the place if you are looking for a boutique hotel or personal service- but efficient, well-located, and very comfortable."
307,1881,"Mar 22 2008 	Loved the Marquis! Excellent location.	Great location, great room, helpful staff. The week before our reservation, we called to confirm a King bed since it was our 20th anniversary trip and we used Amex points for the room. Upon check-in we were told, &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot; and that we had been upgraded to a corner room, 30% larger than a regular room. We were on the 24th floor overlooking Broadway...wonderful view. Very clean room/hotel, comfortable bed with sofa, 2 side chairs, 2 desk areas, full length mirror and good size bathroom. Would stay here again. Starbuck's on the 8th floor was a nice convenience, too."
308,1881,"Mar 22 2008 	I love NY! (and the Marriott)	We just enjoyed a weekend 'getaway' at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, NY. This package included dinner at the revolving rooftop restaurant, The View, and buffet breakfast in the 8th floor restaurant, Encore. The room wasn't ready when we arrived at 2 pm, but they promised to have it by the regular check in at 4. At 4 pm it still wasn't ready (we had requested a Times Square view), so we were upgraded to a larger suite with a Hudson River view. The room was huge, the view was beautiful and the package came with champagne and chocolates. Breakfast the next morning was delicious and the choices at the buffet were excellant. The entire staff was courteous, helpful and very pleasant, I actually felt they we glad to see us! The only disappointmnet was dinner at The View. Reservations were easy and we were seated right away. The restaurant was beautiful and the service excellant, however, the food was bland, actually tasteless. It revolves slowly and there isn't much to look at, mostly the window washing equipement on the landing below. Next time we'll skip The View and eat in one the the local restaurants. The entire package was 417.00 before tax and well worth it!"
309,1881,"Mar 22 2008 	great time had	This was our first visit to New York and we were a little apprehensive as to where to stay, I read some reviews and found very few bad ones so decided on the Marquis. After looking on the web very few hotels offered rooms for 3 adults(we were bringing our 21 year old daughter) We were very impressed with check in and had no trouble with the elevaitors. All the staff were friendly and helpful and the room was spotlessly clean. We were on the 42nd floor and had no trouble with noise and had a great view of the river. The breakfast buffett was a little expensive but lasted us all day. We used room service which was there within 20 minutes and my husband said his sirloin burger was the best burger he had ever tasted!We would recommend this hotel to anyone."
310,1881,"Mar 22 2008	Location Location Location was perfect!	I admit that I was reluctant to stay in NYC due to their bedbug problems but after lots of research, the Marriott Marquis was the perfect choice. We stayed for 3 nights and it was CLEAN, beautiful and although I am very picky - I was incredibly impressed with the whole experience.I would recommend this to ANYONE who is looking for a perfect, clean and wonderfully located (in the heart of Times Square) place to stay. You will NOT be dissapointed and I would love to go back."
311,1881,Mar 21 2008 	great hotel	This is one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in it has a great location and we got a room with a fantastic view of time square all the staff were very helpful and freindly this hotel is pricey but worth every penny the revolving resturant on the top floor is spectacular i will definately stay again
312,1881,"Mar 21 2008 	Super Comfy Beds	Right in the middle of all the action in NYC. The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. We even had a view of the river. The best part of the hotel was the extremely comfy beds, especially after a long day of sightseeing and walking!"
313,1881,"Mar 20 2008 	Perfect location great hotel!	I have stayed a few times at this hotel. For business and pleasure.The location is perfect: right on Times Square. All restaurants, theaters, shopping, etc right on your doorsteps.The hotel itself is huge. But very comfortable. The rooms are large and very comfortable. I love the beds they have!The hotel lobby is an experience all by itself, with the elevators going up and down all the time. The restaurant on the top floor is excellent! Not cheap, but the food was great. You have to go there, if only for the view. You are seated in a restaurant that rotates! You can see the entire city during your dinner.Breakfast are is a bit small, but the selection is great.If you're visiting NY: go to this place. If you search good enough, you can find some great rates."
314,1881,"Mar 19 2008 	Good experience	The Marquis is a great hotel. The staff is amazingly friendly (first impression is everything) The bell staff was there to help you with your luggage and assist you to check in.. My room was not ready (I was also 4 hours early) but the desk took my phone number and called me once it was ready..The staff also held onto my luggage before I checked in and after I checked out while I was still in the city for no charge!! I thought that was a great start to the stay. The room is very large for a NYC hotel room. It was very clean. Beds were comfy. The shower did not have very much water pressure tho. There is 2 starbucks in the hotel along with several restaurants. The location was awesome, right at Time Sqaure."
315,1881,"Mar 19 2008	Call hotel direct and in advance for good price.	While I have not gone to the hotel yet, I wanted to let others know about the rate I rec'd by calling direct and in advance. I called the first week of March and told them I planned to come to NYC with my 16 year old on May 30th for 3 days. I was looking at the other Marriott with the view of the empire state building from the rooms(can't remember the name). I had called them direct. While speaking to the reservation planner I told him how I was taking my daughter for her first trip to NYC and to see Rent on it's final weekend.I told him I couldn't afford much but was willing to spend about $250 a night to have a great view.Rooms at that hotel were $279. He said &quot;If you ever come again you should stay at our premiere hotel The Marquis for a great view.&quot;He said it was more expensive but worth it.Since we had already made the reserve for the other hotel I did not feel like he was pushing me to go to the Marquis at all. Since I figure I might not visit again for many years I asked him what the rates were. He said about $400 but that it was right in times square and the jumbo TV where the ball drops on New years is right out the windows.Sounded great-but pricey! He said the top floors go for over $3000 on New years! I said it was too much but sounded perfect. He said that if you book way in advance and pay upfront he would try and find a better deal. I said &quot;let's try!&quot; I was offered a room &quot;on a high floor with a view of the square that my daughter will love&quot; for $290 a night. I booked and paid for the Friday and Sat nights. The location will save time and allow us to see more of the area.I see this site has quotes offered of over $400 for this hotel so please call direct and try your best.Good luck!"
316,1881,"Mar 18 2008 	Typical Marriott. Great location typical accommodations.	First, let me say that I am a Marriott employee. I love the company's hotels and accommodations. Every time I stay at a Marriott, the service is the same: friendly and helpful. Having said that, the Marriott Marquis Times Square New York lives up to the expected Marriott service level, but isn't really anything more than the typical Marriott property. In fact, there are more comfortable Marriott hotels around the country than the Marquis. What you get at this particular hotel, however, is the location. It is perfectly located in Times Square on Broadway between 46th and 47th.It is expensive to stay at the Marquis, although I got a discount for being an employee. The first floor lobby isn't really the lobby. You have to go up to the 8th floor to check in. Weird, huh? There are a bunch of high speed elevators in a circle that take you up through the hotel, but you might wait a while because there are so many people going up and down. The room was a typical king standard room. I had a partial view of Broadway and a lovely view of an office building. The bed was comfortable, but not nearly as much as some of the other Marriott properties I've stayed at . I don't think this room was equipped with the new Revive bedding that can be found at many other Marriott properties. The bed is why I love staying at Marriott's, and this one wasn't as good as the others. The plasma TV was very nice though, and the channel list included HD channels.As I said, the location was great. It was wonderful coming back from seeing a broadway show and walking to our hotel, in the midst of the throngs of people. I always wanted to be one of those people who could just veer off the path and walk into the hotel. I must say, it was wonderful. The hotel was quiet, once you're in your room, and the accommodations were comfortable. The prices for everything were ridiculous, of course, since you're in Times Square, but what else do you expect? Overall, the hotel was a typical Marriott. Nice design, great location, comfortable room and friendly staff, but nothing spectacular. The best part was being in Times Square."
317,1881,"Mar 9 2008 	love the 1980's	I love this hotel.....it is a wonderful hotel in the heart of the time square.Simple. I love the 1980 styling, the fast fast lifts and the kitch revolving restaurant on the roof. This hotel is the one chain hotels i love to visit. It is everything you would expect, but just that bit more.Do try the buffett at the restaurant."
318,1881,"Mar 1 2008 	An experience in itself	For those who are looking to visit New York City for a day or two, this hotel cannot be beat. There are many things that make the Marriott Marquis the greatest hotel in Times Square, but the #1 by far is the location. It is located directly in the dead center of Times Square, making basically everything in short walking distance. The hotel features an incredibly convenient and smart elevator system which makes getting to your room in a hotel with an incredible number of rooms an easy process. On the main floor area there is a very lovely sushi restaurant, and a complete bar area with a wide range of exotic drinks and a glass-wall intimate-table-seating area that directly overlooks Times Square, giving you a view of the nightlife while chatting with friends. All rooms also overlook Times Square, so a great view is never too far away from you. For those of you who are musical theater enthusiasts, the hotel offers a ticket booth where you can inquire about showtimes, locations, even buy tickets right there at the hotel (though with a rather high service charge). Also, the Marquis plays host to &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot; itself. Service was excellent, we requested a rollaway bed for our room which was promptly delivered, and the staff was always ready to answer any questions we had. Parking was valet, and convenient in every way. The hotel also offers a huge exercise facility, but we didn't get the opportunity to use it. I should mention that this hotel is a great idea for a short-term trip, since the rooms are quite expensive. For a longer stay in New York, I imagine there are more affordable locations, but for a short-term, amazing experience, the Marquis isn't just a place to stay, it will become a memorable part of your experience altogether. (I recently visited NYC again, and even though I didn't stay AT the Marquis, I still went there just for the bar and restaurant!)"
319,1881,"Feb 27 2008	LOCATION COULDN'T BE GREATER	Stayed here for two nights with my Sister &amp; 2 nephews. We had a room with 2 double beds &amp; a view of Times Square. My nephews were happy that Toys R Us was right across the Street. You couldn't ask for a better location in Times Square. The room was nice, the beds comfortable. Close to the subway &amp; to any transportation for that matter. The elevator System was best....you just punch in your floor &amp; it directs you to which elevator to take..we never had to wait. Starbucks in the Hotel is great plus. The breakfast buffet is a little bit too pricey for those who don't like a big breakfast &amp; I didn't feel it was worth the money. There are many restaurants to chose from..but please skip Bubba Gumps Shrimp Co...the food is below average &amp; wasn't impressed with the service. Our salad (which we paid $5 extra for with a meal) came after our meal &amp; only after we asked for it. Half price broadway ticket booth is temporary located there right on the property, but lines start quite early."
320,1881,"Feb 26 2008 	SUPER SERVICE at Marriott Marquis	Stayed at the Marriott Marquis in February '08. Booked with Marriott Rewards points and ended up with a top-floor suite for regular point award! (Request room 4422 if you like a high-floor, quiet! room with a view of Times Square.)A day after we had checked out and gone home, realized that my daughter had left a bag full of makeup and jewelry in the room. It was actually one of the plastic Marriott laundry bags that she had stuffed her things in. I called their Lost and Found and they had in fact found it! They asked her to identify some of the jewelry (was good luck that some of it was monogrammed.) They sent it out via DHL overnight express. Fabulous service! Highly recommended!"
321,1881,"Feb 23 2008 	NEW YORK NEW YORK!!!!	This was the most amazing trip i have ever taken. I had never been to NYC, booked myself, my sister and my best friend from indiana for a girl's weekend.The elevators were awesome...can't understand why some people don't understand the system....NEVER had to wait for an elevator. Starbucks right in the hotel, PIZZA everywhere, I recommend Lombardi's, John's and Bella Vita. City streets were clean, subway was clean and not at all scary. We ventured some distance on the side streets as well and never feared for our safety in any part of town. The location is prime for theatre junkies....I was a peace on Broadway! We explored as much of the city as we could in 3 1/2 days. We wil be back when the WTC memorial park is finished. The city blocks are very short in distance, so even if you have to walk several blocks, you don't log much distance. The staff was amazing...the cocolate covered pretzels that were on our pillows the first night were amazing. LOVED this hotel, worth every penny we spent to stay there, and will definitely book there again. Wear your walking shoes...it is an amazing experience...not one that I would take young chidren on, though. Unless you plan activities accordingly....then i would take them.....but I'm glad I didn't take them on my first trip to the city!Shopping was incredible...didn't have enough time to explore even a small percentage of it....warranting a trip (or 2 or 5) back!"
322,1881,"Feb 23 2008 	Nice hotel great location	Stayed for 5 nights in Jan 08 - coldest place I've ever been.Hotel was great, perfect spot for exploring NY for the first-time visitor. Check-in on 8th floor was smooth, straight up to our room on 42nd floor. Non-Times Sq view, but you could still see bits of it from where we were and view to the west. Best view of the Square was from the bar on the 8th floor anyway, good place for a pre or post dinner drink.Didn't try the gym, but always looked like there were plenty of people there as the elevator zoomed past.One handy thing was the fact you could get into the hotel from the street through different entrances depending on where you were approaching from."
323,1881,"Feb 22 2008 	Tourist Location	If you have never been to NY Stay at this hotel for the tourist hype. The hotel is suoer clean with some good views. Def not worth $300+ a night. The bar was great but expensive.Basically if you want a romantic trip,go elsewhere. If you want to be in times square go there."
324,1881,"Feb 20 2008 	Great location; glad I was expensing it for work	The lobby is a bit unconventional - an elevator trip is necessary to reach the check-in desk. But once you reach the lobby and figure out the elevator system (essentially you enter your floor and you're assigned an elevator), it's a nice hotel.The location, right on Times Square, is convenient for Broadway shows although the area is very touristy. Tourists outnumber actual New Yorkers by a wide margin. My 18th floor room was surprisingly quiet. I couldn't hear much noise from outside or other rooms. The bedding and bathrooms were standard Marriott - white comforter, marble vanity, etc. I ate at the sushi bar one night and found it enjoyable, although oddly empty. Drinks were expensive (my Cosmopolitan was around $14), but it's NYC so that's expected.My room was about $300 (plus taxes) due to a conference group rate. Rack rate was closer to $600, which would not be worth it. As it was, I'm glad my employer was picking up the tab for staying here. But not everyone felt that way as I saw lots of families on vacation here."
325,1881,"Feb 20 2008 	What a location!	Stayed here for four nights from 11th Feb and what a location.Broadway right on your doorstep; Fifth Ave and Central Park just a ten minute walk away. Didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but there are lots of small diners around for a good breakfast for a few dollars. Had valentines day buffet in the revolving restaurant and the top of the hotel - not fab food but at $30 and a view to die for - well worth it.Bar staff could be a little rude but all other staff very helpful."
326,1881,"Feb 18 2008 	best location in Times Square	if times square is your location this hotel is perfectbig rooms can have 3 beds without beeing crowdedjust grab your bags to the 8 floor reception if not you will end waiting a lot for them at your roomif your looking for a boutique hotel this is not the option (massive)i have stay several times for business and fun and will gladly repeatfor inexpensive italian go for Carmines two blocks awayi would rather have breakfast at cafe europa or starbucks than hotel ,doesnt worth the price"
327,1881,"Feb 14 2008	Impressive!	On a sold-out weekend before Christmas, I was NOT expecting the perfect service we experienced at the massive Marriott Marquis. The staff -- from bellmen to housekeeping -- were exceptional in every way. Kudos to the management for maintaining such an efficient, pleasant staff in an enormous hotel in the middle of the busiest area in the United States -- Times Square. For those who haven't visited this hotel for a while, it is definitely time to give it a second look. The lobby, elevators, and rooms have been renovated. The layout of the rooms are fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about our experience there.A big shout-out to Riz, our bellman. You truly are an asset to the hotel staff. Keep smiling!"
328,1881,"Feb 13 2008 	Best Hotel on Planet!	Stayed at hotel from 7th to 10th Feb. Absolutely fabulous service. Staff were very courteous and friendly. We had previously booked the Paramount Hotel which is across the road from Marriott but after reading hundreds of terrible reviews we cancelled and booked the marriott. It was a good thing that we did change our mind as we took a peek into the Paramount while out one day and it looked shabby and has scaffolding all around it. Previous reviews of the marriott stated that there were problems with the elevators but we had no problems at all. They were very straight forward and there were hardly any queues. Only issue we had with the hotel was that we had a meal in the View Restaurant above the hotel and this was a big let down. Staff were unfriendly, food was below standard and cost was huge. I'd advise people to have meal elsewhere and then you can get a better view from empire state anyway. Overall we were very impressed with hotel and will definitely stay again."
329,1881,"Feb 11 2008 	The Only Place to Stay in Times Square	We stay at the Marriott Marquis for an annual convention in January. We've been coming to the Marquis for three years and the rooms, service, and hotel in general are consistently great! The elevators take some getting used to, but the system is wonderfully slick once you have it down. The rooms are large by NYC standards, and the hotel is really centrally located and close to many subway lines. If the weather is not too blustery, I tend to walk everywhere and love the fact that the Marquis is right smack in the center of Times Square.An added benefit, the Marquis is right next to the temporary TKTS booth and right across the street from the permanent booth location."
330,1881,"Feb 9 2008 	Fabulous fabulous experience	Our family stayed at the Marriott Marquis for two nights to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. We will NEVER forget this trip!We drove up from Maryland in a driving rainstorm and were exhausted when we arrived. Just before we arrived, a host from The View Restaurant called on my cell phone to confirm our reservations for dinner that night. He assured me that we would have a window table, and wished my husband 'Happy Birthday'.The valet parking attendant and bellman greeted us right away, helped our girls (7 and 10) fold their blanket and promptly whisked our car and luggage away, with smiles, directions to the lobby, small talk to our daughters and understated efficiency.We entered the hotel and were totally awed! It was beautiful and busy. The elevators zooming up and down (our girls compared them to the vacuum chutes used by drive-in banks to send transactions to your car) with the different colored lights on each were a sight to behold!The concierge at the desk directed us to the elevator pad, and the adventure began. The elevators are on a sort of reservation system: You press the floor you are requesting on the pad, and a letter appears, telling you to go to that specific elevator - how cool is that? The girls worked out a system as to when each would have a turn to 'call the elevator'.We arrived on the 8th floor, which is comprised of the lobby of the hotel, several restaurants, a concierge desk, a bell desk, lounges, gift shop and travel offices (American Express, Ticket offices, etc.). We arrived at 3:35, and waited in line for about 5 minutes to check in. Our girls sat on a bench near the elevators with their necks craned because the elevator bank is a huge circular structure in the middle of the hotel. All rooms are situated on the outside of the 'hallway' and the inside of the hallway gives a view all the way down to the first floor or all the way up to the 47th floor. Our older daughter told my husband that she could go home now, she was so amazed!While checking in, the reservations agent asked our business there, and I told her it was my husband's birthday. She immediately gave us a voucher for free breakfast buffet (up to $60) at the Atrium Lounge!? Amazing! We had a Times Square View room (towards Central Park) on the 32nd floor. It looked like we could reach out and touch the ginormous billboards outside when we opened our curtains! Our luggage arrived within 15 minutes of our arriving at our room and the bellhop took the time to orient us to where we were, pointed out M&amp;M World to us, told us that the Minskoff Theatre was directly across the street (we saw 'The Lion King' matinee the next day) and told us about all of the amenities of the hotel.We just walked around the lobby and gawked (there were several conventions there, but we never felt rushed or crowded). We dressed for dinner and took the elevator down to the 2nd floor to get the express elevator to the 47th floor. The View Restaurant was exquisitely wonderful, on Friday night! The prices were exactly what we'd expect for the service, food quality, view and experience. For a prie fixe of $67.50 per meal (the girls split their meal), we ate WELL - and my husband had several wait staff sing 'Happy Birthday!' to him - BY NAME, to the total delight of our girls!Breakfast at the Atrium Lounge on Saturday morning at 9:30 am was beyond yummy - fabulous service, excellent selections and variety, great omelettes made to order and freshly made waffles and pancakes brought to your table! Oh, My!We had room service for 4 for dinner (after the play and a bicycle rickshaw ride around Central Park), and our food was delivered within 25 minutes of ordering - on a Saturday night?!Overall, we have traveled the world - with and without children - our experience at the Marriott Marquis was one in a lifetime! We are already planning our next trip there! Go Marriott!!!"
331,1881,"Feb 6 2008 	Personal and Business perspective review	I have stayed at this hotel over 15 times for business and once, my last trip for a personal trip. My fiancee is from Kansas and his best friend and wife flew in to celebrate his birthday. They had never seen NY so I used Marriot points to book us a weekend at the Marquis. The main plus of this hotel is location. It sits in the heart of Time Square and most rooms have a fabulous view. For those not familiar with Manhattan it is in Midtown meaning it is centrally located on the island.The bad: The parking attendants are clearly not trained in the &quot;Marriot way&quot; and you can expect to find a &quot;lot full&quot; sign posted if you are checking in on a Friday or Sat. They are experts in the NY way, which means be prepared to pay. Tip $20 bucks and a parking spot magically appears. Marriot really has to fix this as it's hurting their reputation. Full should really mean full especially when it costs $50 bucks a night already to park your beloved vehicle. I saw the parking attendants turn away an elderly couple who had driven from Canada telling them the lot was full and that they had to find another lot. It was shameful. Sending these elderly people out into a city they clearly did not know to find a garage that was 10 blocks away. They didn't even take their baggage and hold it for them.My other gripe is the Japanese restaurant in the lobby (8th floor). It is just awful if you want sushi. I took our friends from Kansas there our first night and the fish was not tasteful and the avocado was brown....ugh. If you must eat there order the steak. The waitstaff is pretty bad too. There are a million fabulous places to eat in NY, go find em!Marriot classifies this as a category 7 hotel but I really think only the location makes it a 7. The carpet is just hideous and the rooms could use redecorating. The good: Especially if you have friends or clients from out of town go sit in the lobby bar and you will find the whole side of the bar is a glass wall that overlooks times square. The drinks are pricey but worth it for the view. Also, if money is not a concern eat in the restaurant on the top floor that rotates. It's excellent and worth it. The check in staff have always been helpful and will generally give you times square view for no extra charge if you ask nicely. The maid service is always good and the concierge is not terribly friendly but then again you are in NY. She does her job but does not go above and beyond. Do you your own research and get the maps from her. The gym is good for those weary business folks that need a work out. Keep in mind there is no pool though. The business center is well run and efficient. **One tip for everyone about the elevators**When you walk in on the first floor you will see a bank of elevators labeled alphabetically A,B,C and so on. You will also see a key pad mounted to the wall at the front of the bank of elevators. You must type in what floor you want to go to before you board an elevator. The keypad will tell you which elevator is going to your floor. For instance you need to check in so you need the 8th floor. Type in 8 and the keypad will blink a letter like &quot;J&quot;. Board the elevator labeled J and it will automatically go to the 8th floor. There are no buttons on the inside of any of the elevators. It all runs off the keypad by computer. If board any old elevator you will have the pleasure of going where everyone else needs to go. Just a tip! I can't tell you how many people I have seen dash for an elevator only to get inside and look dumbfounded when there are no buttons to push. Enjoy!"
332,1881,"Feb 1 2008 	Marquis was just OK	We drove in from Maryland for our one-night stay at the Marriott Marquis in late January 2008. Our first experience was pulling into the parking garage and being approached by a slippery parking attendant. He informed us that the parking lot was full. After our brief hesitation, he starts talking about how there are too many rooms and not enough parking spaces, that he would be &quot;happy to help us out, but he has to answer to his boss&quot; so is there any reason we deserve a spot? He then asked if we were Marriott Rewards members (which we are). We presented him with our number. He proceeded to appear to dig for another legitimate reason we deserved a spot. He then asked us to please wait a minute while he checks availability. I told my friend it was obvious to me this guy wanted paid off. He got out of our car, walked over to him, offered him a $20, and low and behold we had our luggage out of the trunk and we on our way into the hotel within 5 minutes. The Atrium bar was also a bad experience. Don't use the computerized ordering screens at some of the booths. They don't work. No one ever comes. You have to wait for a waitress or just go to the bar and get your drinks yourselves.After the parking lot experience, it didn't really matter to me that the rooms were sufficient and the beds were comfortable. I won't return!"

We paid over $2,500 non refundable in advance. Arrived on the Friday after flight from UK tired and had to wait 3 hours for room to be ready. Room was partial view of Times Square (not the Ball Drop end). It was an Executive Room but very tired, yuk bathroom and in need of refurbishment. We were so tired we didn't complain and although we made requests via the online concierge for rollaway bed for son, it was not in the room, even after 3 hour wait so had to call housekeeping.One of the few perks of staying so many nights is complementary access to the Executive Lounge for breakfast and soft drinks. Discovered that Executive Lounge was closed on Fridays and Saturdays and not open until Sunday evening. However because of the holiday on the Monday it was moved for a private function to a windowless function room. This was then available for one breakfast and the close up again until after the holiday. I see little point in giving my loyalty to a hotel chain, spending thousands and on that rare non-business occasion for such poor service. At New Year this hotel's focus is how much can it scam its customers so that the lounge overlooking Time Square was closed for a $1000 per head function by the hotel with very large security guards to prevent entry (they seem to have only 12 people attend at best) and it has lost sight of the customer's who keep them going. One of the lovely guys from the Exec Lounge did get us complementary breakfast but when we presented the vouchert to the waitress she there after ignored us we assume on and the presumption that she wasn't going to leave her a tip. What is it about New York hotels!!The only good thing at this hotel was the housekeepers. Lovely ladies."
334,1881,"Jan 28 2008 	Consistently good place to stay	I attend a Convention for a week every January and have stayed at a lot of hotels in Times Square. Of all of the hotels I've stayed in, I prefer the Marriott Marquis. The rooms are much bigger than others in the same area, the fitness center is free, the elevators are efficient (now that they've finally finished renovating them), and the staff is nice. Plus, the beds and pillows are really comfortable! If you are visiting Times Square, the Marriott is right in the middle of everything. But if you're there on business, you'll find that the hotel has a nice lounge on the eighth floor for an after-dinner drink, two Starbucks (first floor and eighth floor) for that morning cup of coffee, and is pretty quiet considering it's a huge hotel right in the middle of New York.I have stayed there at least three times that I can remember and have always had good experiences. I highly recommend the Marriott for both business and pleasure!"
335,1881,"Jan 25 2008 	A+ Overall	Location, location, location. Can't get any better than this Times Square hotel. Outstanding service at all levels. Computerized elevators (all 14) were fast, efficient and quietly taking guest to all 45 floors. Room was clean and updated as expected at Marriotts. Had a minor problem and the manager took care of it. Only gripe--parking. Arrived at 4 PM Sat and valet said it was already full. He directed me to a garage around the corner but the attendant there told me no overnight pkg. Ended up parking 2 blocks away for 1/2 the price ($60/night at Mar). Great gym. Lounge w/nice view over Broadway. The View Restaurant had a fabulous buffet and of course, an unrivaled revolving vista of the city. Expensive hotel but worth it."
336,1881,"Jan 25 2008	Great stay!	I had a great stay at the Marquis. The location cannot be better - right in the middle of Times Square and Broadway theaters and a short walk to Rockefeller Plaza, MOMA , Fifth Avenue, the Empire State Building and several subway lines. The room was spacious (far bigger than I expected), clean, comfortable, and very, very quiet. We had a wonderful view of the north end of Times Square from our room, which made the room special. The staff was uniformly welcoming and helpful. The lobby areas have a pleasant buzz of activity. I will definitely stay there again."
337,1881,"Jan 24 2008 	Luxory in the heart of planet Earth	My husband booked a stay here the night he proposed. The room was luxorious and had quite the view of Times Square. The bed was appointed in the finest quality linens and down pillows and comforters. My husband booked a romance package that included strawberries and champagne in the room upon arrival and a dinner at the rotating restaraunt. The strawberries and champage were top quality and so was the food at the restaraunt. The restaraunt staff were polite and courteous in reconciling an error on our dinner bill. The food selection and taste were impecable. The room and bathroom were spotless. As for the location, what can I say? You are in the most exciting location on Earth. The possibilities are endless surrounding this hotel."
338,1881,Jan 18 2008 	Amazing!	We stayed at the Marriott Marquis for five nights for our first wedding anniversary. We originally wanted to have a beach holiday but opted for something different and certainly weren't disappointed! We were lucky enough to have a view of Times Square from our window with the Empire State appearing in the background - fantastic. The lifts (or elevators) were brilliant and we never had to wait. The staff were always helpful and courteous and the maid left our room spotless each day. If you stay at the MM you must have drinks in The View Lounge on the 47th floor - the ride up there is an experience in itself. The drinks are expensive when compared to other bars around Times Square but it is THE only place where you get a 360 degree view of Times Square whilst enjoying a drink or two. We were quite hesitant in venturing out of the vicinity of Times Square in the evenings so spent most of our time eating 'pub food' and also went to Planet Hollywood one eveing. (Don't be alarmed as there are Police on every street corner so you do feel safe especially during the day when it is very busy) If you are more adventerous than us I would highly recommend going that little bit further to enjoy a better meal.We managed to see the main sites but felt we could have stayed longer to experience more of New York City.One last comment to make is that the beds at the MM are so comfortable - we honestly haven't slept that well in a long time! We will certainly be returning to New York at some point in the not too distant future and look forward to staying at the MM again.
339,1881,"Jan 18 2008	What a trip!!!	Came to New York all the way from sunny Edinburgh - Scotland for my 40th birthday, MM was fantastic, the whole hotel was always immaculate and the staff were falling over themselves to be helpful. The room was spacious, beds a little too soft for my liking but the linen felt very luxurious on my poor tired feet at the end of a night. Towels could have been a bit bigger, but again soft and fluffy with a feel of decadence about them! Had read reviews before coming about problems with the waiting time on the lifts - never experienced it at all, the lift in itself was an experience - very fast and a bit gut wrenching as you reached the bottom floor, but all added to the fun. Excellent location for walking to everything in Manhattan and right beside the Times Square city tours bus stop as well, the down town loop trip is fabulous with fantastic entertainment from the tour guides. Would recommend the Marquis Marriott to everyone and anyone, already looking forward to my next trip!"
340,1881,"Jan 15 2008 	Great!	I spent 5 nights at the MM with my wife and my 9 years old daughter. Everything was perfect! Great location,room spacious and clean,a terrific view on Times square. The staff was extremely friendly. Absolutely no problems with the elevators.I reccomend this hotel,specially if you travel with kids,for them the MM is like Disneyland! Volubilis. MILANO (ITALY)"
341,1881,"Jan 14 2008 	My sixth stay at the Marquis-Just keeps getting better!	I almost made the mistake of booking another hotel, just to revisit some of my old haunts in the City. I am so glad that I didn't as the Marquis was the perfect host. They have overcome the nightmares of getting stuck in the elevators between floors and the endless overcrowding and waiting on them. The new system worked perfectly.The room was spotless. Beds snugglier than ever, and the new decor is pleasant. I loved the &quot;real hairdryer&quot; and seriously, pull out the wallet and spring for room service. You won't be disappointed. It is really fabulous. You get the full movie star treatment, exotic orchid, real silverware and fine crystal and food that is five star. If they say 30 mins. it's there, even an hour before showtime.Rates were 271.00 per night, plus taxes. Brunch Buffet 80.00 for two (always delicious), Lunch 80.00 (salad, soup, quesadillas for two, not so good). Not a cheap place but each time I visit, I budget in one dinner or lunch in their restaurants, one room service and one Brunch Buffet.Well worth the money for a beautiful, safe, courteous place to stay."
342,1881,"Jan 12 2008 	New Years Eve at the Marriott Marquis	If you are going to go to New York's Times Square for New Years Eve then THIS is the hotel to stay in. From about 3pm onwards, the Square is full of revellers and closed to anyone else. The Marriott gave us a specially-printed room-key for the night which counted as a pass that allowed us through each of the various cordons and into the square itself. So while thousands had to make themselves comfortable for many hours before midnight, we bimbled in at 11pm, had a quick drink in the hotel bar then joined the revellers for the fireworks and tickertape...which is well worth it! As for the hotel itself, our deluxe room looked onto the Square, very comfortable indeed and kept wonderfully clean (albeit with minor hiccups such as missing coffee/cups on a couple of days). The service is excellent and the concierge couldn't do enough for us. The hotel lounge on the 8th floor is a great place to relax while watching the goings-on in the Square and the View lounge on the 49th floor has superb views of the city. Location-wise, as can be imagined, it is right on Broadway for the theatres and within a short walk of Central Park to the north and Soho/Greenwich to the south. Penn Stn and Grand Central are also very close if arriving/leaving by train. Several lively bars are also within staggering distance from the hotel."
343,1881,"Jan 12 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	Having never stayed in a Marriott before, and not expecting much we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I took our three daughters for one night because my husband had a business meeting very early the next meeting. We had 2 connecting rooms. Usually our hotels of preference when staying in NYC are W Hotels. The meeting was at the Marriott Marquis so we thought this would be easiest. Check in was a breeze. We were suppose to have one king room and one with double beds. We were told we had 2 doubles. No problem This was quickly corrected. The rooms were clean and bigger than we are used to when staying in the city. At around 10 at night I called the &quot;at your service&quot; button for down pillows, which came right up. I also called for toothbrushes which were delivered promptly as well. After the meeting my family had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which, believe it or not, was delicious. With good rates, service, and cleanliness we will remember the Marriott Marquis before the Ws.The only thing is, next time we will travel with our pillows. Even the down ones were a bit hard on the head."
344,1881,"Jan 8 2008 	Loved the Marriott Marquis!!!	We reserved the &quot;Romance Package&quot;. Loved it!!!!! Our room had a Times Square View... amazing. The champagne delivered to the room was a great touch.. The View Restaurant was wonderful.. the food was very good.. the service was excellent.. and of course the view was Amazing!!!The staff at the Marquis made the stay very easy. After we went to see the tree, we didn't leave the hotel again.. There was NO charge at the gym. open 24 hrs very nice.. most hotels charge you..I would recommend this hotel to anyone.. very nice time."
345,1881,Jan 7 2008 	Wow ! - Times Square On New Year's Eve	My first ever visit to New York was spent at the Marriot Marquis.This was a &quot;special occasion&quot; family break between 29/12/2007 and 2/1/2008 so we were here for New Year.We had asked for a low floor with connecting rooms and these were duly waiting for us on the 16th floor.The rooms were luxurious and huge with fantastic comfortable beds.Everyone from the porters to all of the staff were incredibly helpful.The hotel is very central for sightseeing and although busy did not feel that way.The highlight had to be New Year's Eve.All guests were warned that unless you were in Times Square very early that it would be impossible to see anything if you arrived later on.However we didn't manage down until nearly 10.30pm and resigned ourselves to the fact that although we could hear the festivities that we wouldn't see them.Anyway I found a very helpful porter and after I explained to him that this was a &quot; one off &quot; experience he managed to get us into the Square (for a small fee !!!). We were standing beside people who had been waiting for hours.We were very lucky and thankful.So much so we are going to plan another special occasion trip for 2009.Everyone should try this hotel. It is brilliant.
346,1881,"Jan 4 2008 	Location...Location...Location	OK, so maybe this isn't the place to stay if you're on a strict budget, but quite honestly then NYC may not be the town for you! This is one very pricey city! The Marquis is a very upscale hotel right in the heart of the theatre district and some of the best eateries NY has to offer. For the more budget conscious you might want to try the Doubletree or the Courtyard close by. Anyway, getting back to the Marquis, I always request a high floor with a view of times square and sometimes get lucky. Always at least ask! The new elevator system is easy to work, but without a doubt takes some time to get used to. There is usually a hotel employee to ask for help if you need it or certainly always another guest. The rooms and baths are spacious enough, while not palatial. However, how much time will you actually spend in your room? And when you are there, you'll most likely be sound asleep after an exhausting day of sightseeing, theatre and definitely eating! Be sure to at least check to see if some of the shows you are hoping to see are available at the half price ticket booth ... incredible savings ... line up early as the crowds grow quickly. ENJOY!"
347,1881,"Jan 3 2008 	Love this hotel	We stayed there on mid november. Me and my sister we both work for Marriott as part of their International Lodging area. We just loved the hotel experience...... general.We checked in around 7 am, of course they didnt have rooms at the time but they stored our luggage. We return to the hotel around 7 pm, and got a room on the 32th floor. The room was lovely and the view of the city was stunning. We love the location and went out to shopping at 1 am!!!!If you wanna have a REAL taste of what NY is all about stay here, my sister was arguing because she wanted to stay at the Walforg Astoria but at the end, she was glad we stayed at the Marquis..... you cant beat the location!!!!"
348,1881,"Dec 31 2007 	the right hotel in New York	Of course, there are more luxurious hotels in New York or more historical or more expensive ones, but none of them can beat its location. And this hotel is so &quot;newyorkish&quot;: expensive, noisy, big, crowded (OK it was Christmas time). The rooms are fine, clean, the beds extremely comfy. Nothing fancy but everything was fine and in good condition. Re the location, as said before you are close to everything. You can find tickets for broadway shows at a discounted price but you have to be patient (you can easily wait three hours). The rotating restaurant/bar at the top floor is amazing but do not expect for a culinary experience."
349,1881,"Dec 27 2007 	Guess we went on a bad week????	I am confused on the reviews here. After our stay, I was sure to come here and find bad reviews. We went for five days the week prior to Christmas and here is what we experienced. We checked in around noon and were told we could check in and get a lower level room on the 8th floor, or wait and get one on the 49th. We decided to wait four hours and get a higher room. After checking our bags in and walking around the city in our traveling clothes (from Tampa, FL) we returned to find they were giving us the room on the 8th floor. After speaking w/ management we were offered on on the 34th which was fine. The room was a nice size- a little larger than the standard. The bed was VERY comfortable, but there was a layer of dust on the back of the toilet and the tissue box was disgusting. It had toothpaste spray all over the side and dust all over the top. YUCK! My husband always checks the waters b/c we have been charged many times for the person before us opening them and filling w/ tap water. Of course, this had already been done (ALWAYS CHECK THIS!) and we called the front desk immediately so we would not be charged. We left the room and came back two hours later which is when the guy had JUST come to the room to replace the waters. When we rec'd our bill days later, we were charged for the waters we called about! However, it was taken off our bill with a simple visit to the front desk. We were also charged a $15 room service fee for the guy to bring us new ones.The location was excellent w/ the subway close and all shows and good food close. I HIGHLY recomment John's pizza around the corner in the old church- yummy!Concierge was hit or miss. I would either get someone extremely informative and polite, or I got an attitude that they thought they were better than me and how dare I ask them a question. There was a spanish girl w/ med lenght hair that was polite every single time and remembered me. And I always tipped.I also noticed they do not answer the phone with &quot;Good evening Mr. Kilpatrick how may I help you?&quot; as they did years ago. I missed that and thought it gave it a personal touch.The View is awesome but be careful. I ordered the buffet late one night. It is $20 and within minutes, bus boys ran up and grabbed my plates!!!! I guess they were closing which I wish my waiter expressed to me before I paid $20 for two bites!The elevators were slammed on Sat. and Sun. which is understandable.All in all I will stay somewhere else next time. I'm not sure if they got new management or what but it has gone down hill from a few years ago."
1,1886,"Good Solid Hotel	Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Omni Berkshire. There were 3 of us in total. We had requested a room with 2 beds however the best they could do was a room with 1 bed and then a put up bed. To be honest I didnt think that this was acceptable. We had booked at the beginning of the year so there really was no excuse. Im not happy with put up beds  when you pay for a nice hotel you expect a proper bed to sleep on. The 1st room we were given was so small  we just couldnt figure out where the put up bed would go as it was so small so we asked to be moved to a larger room  we were given a larger room and I was impressed with the swiftness of this however really on arrival we should have been given this originally.The concierge were the best thing about the hotel  so incredibly helpful and full of knowledge. Everyone in the hotel was friendly. We had dinner in the restaurant  very good quality. The resturant manager was very professional and friendly.The hotel and room was very very clean. Location wise it was excellent  it was just by Cartier on 5th Avenue  so a short walk to central park  and very need a tube station.One thing I must say is that on arrival  they demanded taking approximately $50 per day for a charge against the room in case we charged anything to the room. Most odd. I have stayed at many many hotels and not once have I ever encountered this. We will await this back on to our card  they did say itd take 3 business days  so we shall see! We did say that we wouldnt be charging to the room and if we did we would be paying immediately by cash.The meat packing district is good for bars, clubs and resturants.We had dinner at the Plaza and also on a different day - lunch. Both were lovely.The hotel is very nice. I would consider staying again."
2,1886,"Nice hotel	Got to stay at this hotel by chance from getting a deal from priceline.net. I arrived to the hotel by 10 am they let me early check in. I signed up to be the hotel's membership before checking in, so I can use wi-fi in my room for free. The hotel is located a few blocks from Time Square and close to 5th Ave, where you can find hi-end shopping retails. Love it!!!!"
3,1886,"Nov 24 2009 	Wonderful stay/Perfect Location	Our weekend experience at the Omni was wonderful. The rooms were immaculate and the staff super helpful! Was so convenient to all the sites - just can't beat it for a weekend with friends in the City! Check-in was quick with friendly faces, the Concierge assisted us with everything from shopping to the Theater to great places to Dine. Especially want to recognize Michael and Lenny who were always there to greet us with a smile. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends!"
4,1886,"Nov 20 2009	Not that great we won't be back	Omni Berkshire Place positions itself as being much higher class than it actually is. We stayed here for a week at Christmas. The location was great for Manhattan sightseeing, but we're going to stay elsewhere when we go back to NYC. When we made the reservation, they couldn't confirm a room with two beds, which of course wasn't available when we arrived. So we ended up with a massive single bed in a teeny room with a roll-away bed, which we knew wasn't going to work as soon as we saw it (especially considering the room rate). So we opted to move to a smoking room that had two beds. Worst mistake ever. We didn't really stay in the room that much, but the time we were there was awful because of the smell. They gave us a &quot;clean air machine&quot; (which turned out to just be a humidifier) that supposedly clears the rooms of smoke within a few minutes. Not the case. The room smelled worse than a Vegas casino the entire 6 days. Of course all of this was our choice as we could have opted to stay cramped in the first room, but the front desk wasn't at all concerned or empathetic when we called every day to ask if a non-smoking room had become available. The actual room itself was decent enough (all the mirrors and marble in the bathroom was over the top though) and the lobby was nice, but poor staff attitudes about the room change issue, some problems with our bill, and a nice-but-unhelpful concierge are mainly why we won't be back."
5,1886,Nov 9 2009 	you guys suck [--]	please no one stay here!! horrible horrible the hotel blamed everything on their renovation that is going to take place in dec and jan... we were staying for 4 days didnt want to give us 2 double beds til i complained about asking for a roll away 3x but never got it. then we had no electric socket in the room 3 different department by fone call said it was in the bathroom they never believed us when we said there wasnt one til we got an engineeer to prove to them we didnt have one then they gave us attitude! i was shocked at the attitude we were given. only half nice person there was the lady who checked us in it was 7am we were exhausted from our trip from the west coast! but she had to give us a lecture on how she'd normally charge us for checking in early BUT she wont this time and how she would charge us for a rollaway BUT she wont this time... even tho i asked for 2 doubles and she said they were sold out of 2 doubles! i wrote to their corporate i am still waiting for a response... their turndown service was a joke left dirty linen in our room then manager said she was having a &quot; hard day and had lots of things on her mind&quot; i sympathized but why would the manager tell me that? only nice thing to say about this hotel was the location! finally one GREAT THING! BRAVO
6,1886,"Nov 9 2009 	great location huge room!	just got back from weekend stay with 2 children. Excellent hotel- very nicely appointed and the room was enormous- was a total surprise to find something like that in Manhattan. One very large bedroom and bathroom- with separate bath and shower- and then a very large lounge with decent sofa bed for the children. Nice touch of a kids welcome pack.Location was superb easy to walk to Rock, Central Park, lots of shops.Staff helpful. Had dessert and drinks in the Fireside on Friday night- even though a fairly &quot;grown up&quot; ambience we were able to find a great, comfy alcove with sofas, out of the way, where our 3 and 6 year old happily toasted marshmallows over a little dish of charcoal, while we had cocktails.Just fab."
7,1886,"Oct 27 2009 	Great weekend getaway!	The Omni was perfect for our weekend in NY. It is within walking distance to Times Square, shopping, restaurants, etc. The hotel was comfortable, clean, and provided great service."
8,1886,"Oct 27 2009 	Great Location with great rooms	My wife and I just returned from this hotel where we enjoyed a 4 night honeymoon. We arrived at midday and the staff were able to check us in early without question. The concierge helped me surprise my wife with flowers in the room when we got back after dinner the first night. The staff seemed very knowledgeable about everything in New York as well. The rooms were quite large with a sofa, armchair and writing bureau all easily fitting into the room without overfilling it. Our room overlooked 6th Avenue but the noise was minimal.We only had 2 v.minor gripes...1..I mentioned that we were on honeymoon a couple of occasions and I thought that a bit more of a fuss could have been made of us! Even sending up a glass of champagne would have been appreciated 2. Service in the bar area was very slow. All in all an excellent hotel and we will look into returning for any future visits."
9,1886,"Oct 24 2009 	Fantastic hotel and Concierge staff	We visited in mid-October for 3 nights in NYC. The hotel was beautiful, comfortable and wonderfully located. I found the concierge staff, especially Marilyn, incredibly helpful, friendly and professional. I will absolutely stay there again and recommend it highly."
10,1886,"Oct 23 2009 	Great location good bar and good perks with Select Guest membership	Stayed for 5 nights at this hotel with my girlfriend. Hotel location is superb, minutes away from all the major shops, ten minutes max from Times Square and two subway stations right nearby (51st and 53rd/5th Ave).Fireside Restaurant and Bar at the hotel was really nice. Didn't have food there but from what I saw it looked good. Nice place for a late night drink and an excellent place to watch sport on the 4 large screens. The TV's didn't dominate the bar though so you could still relax and have a nice drink and a chat. Bar staff were friendly and approachable.Make sure you sign up for the Select Guest program. Complimentary drinks and newspapers every morning were always correct and on the times we requested them. Shoe shine and pressing of clothes was also a benefit. Doormen at hotel were great and got you a taxi with no trouble at all. One downside was the old TV with poor reception in the room. But who goes on holiday to watch TV?! Also there was a bit of a bad smell in the room when we arrived but was corrected for us after we raised this with the front desk.Some good places for breakfast nearby such as Isadoras which is right across the street, Europa on Madison Avenue which was a really nice place and also Prime Burger on 51st Street which was a classic old school diner. Can't stress enough how good the location is. Will definitely stay there next time we are in NY."
11,1886,Oct 21 2009 	Great Hotel excellent location right off of 5th ave. 10 minute walk from Grand Central.	We were very satisfied with our stay. It was a short walk from Grand Central Station and not to much farther to Times Square. Shopping on 5th avenue is right outside your door with Cartier across the street and St. Patricks Cathedral and Rockafeller Center along side NBC studios about 4 or 5 blocks up. I would definitely stay there again in the future. Great price found on Priceline.com.
12,1886,"Oct 20 2009 	Great location in heart of NY	We stayed at the Omni Berkshire for 5 days in October and were again impressed with its high quality and wonderful location. The hotel service is wonderful, the rooms are comfortable and large for NY and the hotel service is very good. We were able to go to all locations of the city easily with 5th avenue and Rockefeller center being very close. It's a couple of blocks to the subway and easy walking uptown on Madison Ave. I also recommend the Omni club as it provides free wifi and coffee service."
13,1886,"Oct 15 2009 	Thought this was great	Was at the omni for a wedding in early Oct. The staff could not have been more helpful, the rooms were very clean and everything was quite enjoyable in the hotel.We registered for the 'select guest' and got free wfi service, which also comes with free morning beverages, newspaper and evening turn down service. We got a group rate, which for NYC was a bargain. Would definitely stay again."
14,1886,"Oct 12 2009 	Really tired and just completely impersonal	This hotel is in the centre of town but in terms of its market position is nowhere. Tired rooms, even more tired staff who seem not to realize that the &quot;New York Snarl&quot; should be left at the door if you are in a service industry. Staying here varies from being okay to being quite unpleasant, with too many people coming in the front door for people to care. Then you look at the bill. Either go up market to the Peninsula or down market to somewhere like The Empire. Both are far better value."
15,1886,"Oct 9 2009 	Avoid this hotel at all cost	Nothing but problems starting with reservations and ending with front desk. Extremely unhelpful and uncaring. There are so many great hotels in NYC, so you should have no problems skipping this one."
16,1886,"Oct 8 2009 	The place to stay in NY for luxury and convenience	We traveled to NY for our honeymoon. We loved staying at the OMNI Berkshire Place. We loved the rooms, service, food and location. I would definately recommend this hotel."
17,1886,"Oct 7 2009 	The best location and service in NYC	My friend and I arrived Sept 17th 2009. The hotel was beautiful, clean and very welcoming. I can't say enough about the service....we called for extra sheets on the bed and two maids arrived at our room within 5 minutes and completely re-made the bed and believe it or not, refused a tip from us. The hotel is about 15 seconds aways from 5th Ave to the right and the same for Madison Ave to the left. Just the most enjoyable stay ever. If you are looking for style, elegance, comfort and LOCATION....this is the place. I definitely give it 5 stars! Rhoda"
18,1886,"Oct 7 2009	The Omni has won me over	I stayed at the Omni for a long weekend girls getaway trip with my mom and I couldn't be happier with my experience. I was bummed out that I was unable to stay at either of my favorite hotel chains (The Fairmont or The Ritz Carlton) because it was a last minute trip and the rates at these properties were about $1,000.00 per night! Since I always stay at either property if available wherever my travels take me, I wasn't expecting much from the Omni because I paid a lot less and I've always thought that there is really no comparison when it comes to service and quality for either of my favorite hotels. But I was proved wrong immediately upon my arrival at 10:30 am...not only was my room ready, they gave me a large, quiet room, on a high floor, away from the elevator, with extra pillows, just as I had requested when I booked my reservation. Their Select Guest Program works wonderful. I loved getting my complimentary beverages &amp; paper in the morning. The room was spacious, nicely furnished, and clean. The bathroom was a replica of what I have seen in a number the Ritz Carlton's rooms, large all marble with a Jacuzzi and separate shower, lots of counter space, lighted mirror etc... Not the typical (closet size) bathrooms that others complain about in NYC. The service was also very efficient &amp; courteous. The only things I would change....the furnishings &amp; TV, although nice they need to be replaced, you can see the wear and tear and doesnt everyone have a flat screen these days? Over all I would recommend this place to those who are hesitant because of the bad reviews, I definitely plan on returning to this property, the area is of course wonderful with all the best and most exclusive shops all around you, the subway is a couple of blocks away, plenty of cabs around if you prefer to take them &amp; you don't see the typical &quot;dirty city&quot; aspects around. There were plenty of police officers around the area, so safety was not an issue. We didn't see a single beggar in the vicinity not until we left the area and went down to lower Manhattan or near the parks. If youre on a budget then this is not your place or area to visit, otherwise enjoy what the hotel has to offer the hotels restaurant was delicious too."
19,1886,"Oct 4 2009 	Great location to explore NYC	We took the Airtrain and then the subway from JFK to the hotel ($7.25) - the nearest station was on 53rd Street. The hotel is conveniently located on 52nd Street between 5th Avenue and Madison. We arrived late at night and were attended to politely and efficiently (although not the warmest of welcomes!). We had a spacious room on the eighth floor which was clean and well decorated. The room came with 2 queen size beds and they were comfortable. There was the usual TV, minibar, hair dryer, basket of goodies in the bathroom, magazines. We didn't have any trouble with street noise although as per previous reviews, the sound proofing between rooms could have been better. Following previous advice, we decided to have breakfast at Isadora's over the road and the Europe Cafe one block up on Maddison - both were very good value. The hotel is ideally located for exploring New York and we found it was easy to reach many of the sights by foot. The beds were turned down and the room fresh and clean when we arrived back from our day out. The doormen were friendly and helpful. Some of the common areas such as hallways are in need of updating but it did not detract from our over all experience. We were lucky enough to book the hotel through Priceline so didn't pay the standard price. Perhaps this influenced our expectations compared to other reviewers. A nice touch was an information sheet at the front desk detailing local events during the time we stayed there. We didn't use the hotel restaurant as we prefered to eat out. We would stay here again based on our experience."
20,1886,"Oct 2 2009 	reservation issues	If you want trouble free reservations with Omni Berkshire you're better off calling the hotel directly. I've made a reservation through Expedia and after reading the reviews here I got prudent and said its best to call just in case make sure all is OK. When i called the hotel to confirm it, they barely were able to find it. Why do they even issue confirmation # if they cant use them, i wonder.Also i wanted to let them know i will only arrive late in the evening and ask for a quiet room if there is such a thing, but the reservations person told me &quot; you didnt make the reservation through us directly, I cant make any notes on your booking&quot;. How hard can that be really now?Perhaps they should just take their &quot;service oriented&quot; hotel off the internet trip aggregation websites altogether, that will solve all problems."
21,1886,"Sep 27 2009 	Nice hotel great location but our first impression....not friendly	My husband and I spent one night at the Omni for a getaway weekend in September. Our very first impression was the young woman at the front desk. Maybe her specialty would be behind the scenes. We waited while she was rudely helping a gentleman in front of us. When it was our turn, she didn't make eye contact, never smiled or welcomed us to the hotel. We did not expect our room to be ready as it was 10 a.m. but asked whether we should check in then or later. She spoke with an attitude. She was very unfriendly. My husband and I travel quite a bit and feel that your hotel management would want a guest's first impression to be a professional, friendly, smiling face. That was not the case. Luckily, the rest of the stay was wonderful!"
22,1886,"Sep 27 2009 	All round great hotel for a first time stay in NYC	My husband booked a four night stay Aug/Sept for a surprise trip to NY. Neither of us had been to New York before and this centrally located hotel made for a great base to explore the main sights.Having booked rather last minute, he chose the Omni Berkshire based on the reviews on Trip Advisor. Maybe given more time, my husband may have found a better value for money hotel - hotels in NYC are relatively expensive however the OMNI Berkshire delivered on many fronts - location, cleanliness and the rooms were surprisingly large. The location is fantastic, just off 5th Ave and a very short walk away from at least two subway stations. Unlike some of the other reviewers, noise was not an issue at all. In fact we were surprised at how quiet the hotel was in such a central location!Our room was bigger than expected and had everything you would expect from a 4* hotel. Overall a fantastic stay. We would certainly recommend the hotel to first timers to NYC."
23,1886,Sep 24 2009 	Good Location But Did Not Meet My Expectations	We stayed at this hotel for four nights from Sept 3 to Sept 7. Everything at the hotel was just ok. For an OMNI I expected a quieter room. There was too much street noise. We had chosen an premium room and not the least expensive one. The hotel was worn. Everything worked. The people were nice and everyone was very helpful.The service was good. But nothing was exceptional. We would not stay here again. I was going to pick the Sofitel in New York because we have had a good experience at their location in Rio last year but we tried this hotel instead.The place was in a very convenient location. That is important to us when we travel.
24,1886,"Sep 20 2009 	Simply A Wonderful Experience! Will Definitely Be Back 	What a superb experience we had this past weekend (9/19/09) celebrating my daughter's Sweet 16 in NYC! The entire staff gave us their undivided attention at all times, especially Hector. When we arrived we received an upgrade in our room and even an early check in. Recommendation for dinner and hot spots were right on. WOW! We were blown away! We have stayed at many NYC hotels before and our usual #1 choice was booked beause they were booked solid! Thank goodness, we just found our NEW #1 choice of hotels in NYC. Good pricing and good location! Thank you Omni Berkshire for making our New York weekend a perfect 10! ...please don't listen to those naysayers on reviews previous to this one because this hotel is a class act!"
25,1886,"Sep 20 2009 	Nice hotel room Select Guest amenities hard to get	Lovely Hotel, friendly staff., fabuous room. Having said that, to get any of my select guest amenities I had to call the front desk and request each one. - same at the other two omni's I've stayed at: San Diego and San Anonio. The room phone buttons to call services didn't work, I had to call the operator. The complimentary beverages took an hour to arrive, and the second day went to the wrong room. The second night there was an intermittent sewer smell in the room for a few hours. When I asked the conceirge staff for teen shopping advice I'd have thought they'de have a list of referals; they didn't even know a fab teen shop Strawberry was 100 steps away. Four star? Maybe 3.5"
26,1886,Sep 15 2009 	Great Hotel/Super Location and Superior Staff	Location on 52nd and Madison was great. The staff was superior. I read some reviews on trip advisor and found it hard to believe that this hotel received some poor reviews. We stayed at LeParker last year and this place was better.
27,1886,"Sep 15 2009 	Nice Hotel but Overpriced	We stayed at the Omni right after staying at the Helmsley Ny, anticipating that the Omni would be much better since it was much more expensive.I cannot say that it was better. In fact, I can say it was just OK, a nice hotel but nothing special.Staff was friendly, but the at the Helmsley were nicer. Rooms were smaller at the Omni, and we really could not find the reason for the price difference. We asked for a quiet room and were put on the rooms facing the back side - what a disaster! There was construction being done there that woke us up at 6:30 am. Didn't they know that? AC made lots of noise in the room, we asked for someone to come and look, and were told that is the normal noise. We were then moved to a room in which the AC was less noisy and the room wuieter, wonder why that could not have been the case in the first place.All in all I am sure guest srtaying in the Omni will have a nice time. I am not sure they could not get more for their money. I will not recommend it. Another thing we did not like - no complimentary internet like in the lobby like many hotels offer now, and a feeling that everything needs to be payed for."
28,1886,"Sep 15 2009 	Nice place... good location	My husband and I took a trip to New York to celebrate his big birthday! We got a great deal on the lowcostnewyork wesbite to stay at Omni Berkshire Place that cost about half the price of the Omni hotel's own website. We took the airtrain and subway from JFK airport to NY which was quick and easy, and very cheap at $7.25 each! The subway was right near to the hotel and we had no problem getting there with our cases. Check-in was quick and easy. I also signed up online for the select guest programme so gave my membership number at check-in to allow us the free wi-fi in our room, free newspaper and complimentary morning drinks. Really worth signing up for - you get 2 drinks each every morning and can choose from tea, coffee, hot choc, juices, cola &amp; bottled water which was really worthwhile.. do not leave home without signing up for this! Take a laptop too as the wi-fi is really useful for planning your days and in particular for us allowed us to check-in online with Virgin for our flight home.We were in room 835.... we did expect the most basic room as we got such a good rate so we were not suprised by the poor view of a building site but I'm sure others who had paid a lot more than us would have been very disappointed. The noise was pretty bad during the day and on our first morning, we were woken up at 6am by the construction noise which was a shame, but as we were in New York, we just got ourselves up and out to enjoy the city. The room was a really good size with a huge bed &amp; big bathroom. We did get a king bed and non-smoking room as requested which was nice. As in other reviews, the hotel is a little dated - eg furniture and old style TV but if you are there to see NY then the hotel is fine... we have stayed in other hotels with much much smaller rooms.The hotel is in a good location - close by to walk to fith avenue, times square, grand central station, central park, rockerfeller center &amp; top of the rock, st patricks cathedral.... need I go on... and if you wanted to venture further afield, the subway was very close to the hotel and for $7.25 you could buy a one day fun pass to venture around the city. The hotel was extrememly clean and our room was cleaned every day... with a turndown service at night which also provided you with ice which was a nice touch! Check out was again quick and easy and nice at 12 noon. We were able to leave our cases with the bellmen as our flight was not till the evening so we could go off and do some last minute sightseeing and shopping. We were delayed a little when returning to collect our cases which was a shame as there didn't seem to be enough staff on hand to collect everyone's cases but when we were seen to the man was polite and quick to get our case.All in all a nice hotel that I would recommend, but probably not at the prices on the hotel's website... definitely look at other websites first."
29,1886,"Sep 12 2009 	Lots of annoyances at a good hotel	I've now stayed at this hotel two times. My first stay, two years ago, was much better than my last. The Omni's convenient location could not overcome the numerous small problems that I encountered during my recent stay.It all began at check-in. I arrived late at night because of weather delays, so I was hoping to go straight to bed. Unfortunately, the room I had been assigned had not been cleaned by housekeeping prior to my arrival. So, I headed back to the reception desk. The gentleman there apologized &amp; gave me another room. This room was very nice &amp; probably a little larger than the premier level room I had reserved. The room was clean and very comfortable. Unlike other guests, I had no noise issues whatsoever. I did, however, have other annoyances. The Omni Select Guest program gives members a complimentary morning beverage. You fill out a card &amp; hang it on your door at night, then room service brings the beverage in the morning. At check-in, the clerk told me that unfortunately, they were out of the cards. I found this odd. The next morning, they still didn't have them. Finally in the afternoon, the cards arrived from somewhere. It may sound small or petty, but in the hospitality industry, little things mean a lot. The rest of my stay was thankfully uneventful. My involvement with the Omni did not end at check-out. When I checked my credit card balance a few days later, I noticed the charge on my account was more than my actual bill. After several calls to the hotel, the accounting department determined that I was charged for someone else's stay and they, in turn, were charged for my stay. I guess we checked in on the same day and had similar names. The whole thing was bizarre. At least they eventually figured out what happened and my card was credited for the difference. As an additional annoyance, Omni Select Guest has still not awarded my airline miles after almost a month. Overall, the hotel is nice, but the rooms are really showing their age. The staff is friendly and the location is great. The numerous annoyances I experienced, however, have led me to believe that I will search for a new hotel during my next stay in New York."
30,1886,"Sep 7 2009 	Hotel Great Noise Poor	There are certain things that hotels can control and I think the Omni Berkshire was solid. I would recommend it to friends and family. The following are the details of our stay, as well as pros and cons.Our Stay:The hotel room we were originally given smelled like someone recently smoked a cigar. This was not a great start, but the bell staff upgraded us to a larger suite, which was exactly what I would expect a first class hotel to do. For two nights, the room was great. On the third night, a loud party moved to the room next door and you could hear the noise through the wall very easily. We could also hear people walking around above us. Also, there was ALL NIGHT CONSTRUCTION on 4th Ave with hammering and drilling that kept us up all night prior to our departure date (We were on the 12th floor). I know the hotel cannot control this, but I cannot believe the city would pull an all night job like this across from the hotel. If the hotel knew about it, they certainly did not let the guest know that the construction would be happening.Pros:1. Great location in Mid-Town. Walk to Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller, Easy Subway access2. Nice Hotel Rooms, Granite Bathroom3. Great Concierge, Staff, Turn Down ServiceCons:1. Loud2. Cigar Smell in First Room3. Needs further renos to be top-end Mid Town4. Not too many restaurants within the block"
31,1886,"Sep 3 2009 	Great rooms....too much noise.	We went for the US Open and got this hotel on Price Line. We stayed Saturday through Wednesday. The hotel is really nice, the doormen are friendly as are those at the reception desk. The room, which was a nonsmoking one with a king bed was on the 20th floor. The bathroom was marble, there was always hot water and the hotel provided q-tips, cotton balls, shampoo, etc. The bed was very comfortable.The hotel offers complimentary morning beverage service along with wifi internet service when you sign up for their select member program. We were able to choose from coffee, tea, juices, and which newspaper we preferred. The only negative aspect of the hotel was the noise we heard pretty regularly. Saturday night, we were awoken at 4am to obnoxious, loud drunks making their way to their room in our hallway. I could understand every word. Even during the day I could unintentionally make out conversation in another room. Monday morning was our first day to attend the US Open and were awoken at 7am sharp with the construction being done on a building across a courtyard from our room. Tuesday was the same thing - 7am sharp! We decided to move to another room away from the construction, which the staff was more than willing to accommodate. We spent our last night in a room on the street side. The room was the same elegant comfortableness that the other room was. Unfortunately, the street noise was pretty audible."
32,1886,"Aug 30 2009 	Fantastic Stay at the Omni	Every year, my friend and I meet for a girls' weekend in New York. We had stayed at the Omni a couple of years ago, and due to slight displeasure with the location of the room (near the elevator - noisy) and the thought that we should try something different, last year we stayed somewhere else. We found that the concierges at the other hotel were less knowledgeable and less connected than the ones at the Omni, and since as a Select Guest I got a special rate on a room at the Omni this year, we decided we'd give it another try. I also had a couple of free upgrade certificates that I had gotten in the past (and which had expired) but I thought I'd bring them along and ask if I could still use them. We were not disappointed. We were upgraded to a Suite (complete with full living room). The only downside was it was on the smoking floor, and neither of us smoke, but it was a small price to pay. The smoke odor wasn't too bad, especially after opening some windows and getting some fresh air in there. (it's also nice to be able to open the windows). The deep bathtub was very comfortable, the rooms were huge, and the bed was very comfortable. Randy the Concierge was good as ever, and everyone at the hotel was friendly and helpful. We're looking forward to our next stay at the Omni! (ps, across the street is a restaurant called The Fig and Olive - it was really good too)"
33,1886,"Aug 23 2009 	Excellent stay	When you check out a hotel, you are drawn to the negative reviews first. I read these reviews for our hotel and was SCARED of the front desk staff and the hotel in general. We booked on hotwire and I started to think ... 'hmm, is this going to be the best place to stay?'. Well, I am so happy that we booked here. We had an excellent experience with the front desk staff - very friendly (I will recommend you sign up for the signature guest on their website - we got bottled water on check in [good - since it was +100 degrees F when we checked in], free wifi, and choice of coffee/tea/hot chocolate/juice/etc delivered to our room every morning, etc).The room was modern but in the verge of being outdated - large pieces of furniture needed to be replaced. The thing is, when you are in NYC, you sleep in your room for 6 hours a night and are busy the rest of the time - wby else would you go there?I would stay there again in a heartbeat - very close to mid town 'stuff', such as Broadway and Times Square. I can't wait to go back!!"
34,1886,"Aug 21 2009 	Couldn't believe how great the service was!	I went with friends for a weekend. There were four of us in an &quot;upgraded&quot; suite. The room was a wonderful corner room with a nice view of the city day/night. The doormen/valet were the best as well as every staff member we encountered. Coffee/juice was brought to us each a.m. Room was updated (furniture, flat screen tv, etc.)Would definitely stay here again when visiting NYC. The price for the comfort and location could not be beat."
35,1886,"Aug 19 2009 	We stay here whenever we are in NYC	We like everything about this hotel, except maybe the price but it is N.Y.C. and most prices are high there. The location is good, we like the rooms and have occasionally been upgraded to a suite, the hotel is very clean, the people who work there are friendly and very helpful. We drive there and have always been please with the valet parking and feel that they take good care of our car and our luggage when unloading and loading the car. We have stayed there 2 or 3 times a year for the past 8 years when we visit our son and most of the same doormen are still there so it must be a good place to work!"
36,1886,"Aug 14 2009 	They almost killed my son	This is the first message, but not the last. Four days before Christmas 2007 I checked my family into this hotel, booking the Madison Suite. We got in late, dropped our bags and went to the Plaza. My son who was 7 at the time found a treadmill in the corner of the room, which we did not order, request or sign for. The machine jettisoned him of at top speed into a cast iron coffee table. The security people showed up with a bandaid and a can of antiseptic spray! They didn't bother to call an ambulance, my wife had to flag a cab to take him to Lenox Hospital were a brilliant plastic surgeon stitched his face back together, thank god.We just received word that they are taking zero responsibility and not going to cover the medical expenses, let alone damages! And this is a 4 star? BTW, when we checked out 3 days later the treadmill still had not been removed. This is just the beginning."
37,1886,"Aug 10 2009 	Great location. Needs updating.	We booked this stay through a travel website offering a package on airfare and a hotel. I have stayed at several other Omni properties (including St. Louis and Chicago) and figured that it was a safe bet. The Omni Berkshire Place is in an older building right in the middle of midtown so space is at a premium and the hotel does a good job with what it has. The lobby is small but welcoming, the general areas are wearing well and don't feel as dated as the guest rooms feel. The view from the top of the hotel and the very nice health club are excellent. The king bed guest rooms do not leave much room for spreading out--but that isn't unusual for a hotel in NYC. The furnishings in the guest rooms we saw are showing their age (e.g. conventional tube television, bedspread rather than duvee cover, etc.). The bathroom is small but well done. Room-to-room noise needs to be addressed but thankfully we had good neighbors. The guest rooms we saw on one side of the hotel had terrible views of construction but what can you expect? The restaurant and bar are excellent. Last but not least the staff was excellent. Front desk and concierge were polite and accommodating. Housekeeping staff encountered in the common areas also excellent and helpful. As for location, it would be difficult to find a better centrally located hotel in the city, and if you can get a good rate, all the better."
38,1886,Aug 10 2009 	ok but not worth 4 stars more like 3	This hotel is in a good location but it is not the best Hotel in the area the New york Place which is about 2 minutes around the corner from the Omni is so much nicer and even less expensive than the Omni.The rooms in the Omni feel old fashioned and don't really look like the web site pictures. Hotel staff are also quite rude at times but cleaning staff are friendly.
39,1886,"Jul 31 2009 	Great Location But That's About It	We were fine with a tiny room - even one facing construction as our view. After all, it is New York. The &quot;old style&quot; TV, which we hadn't seen in a hotel in several years that was positioned at a 90 degree angle from the bed was unexpected. The shower/tub with no rubber mat that nearly caused a horrible accident was unacceptable. Then there was the toilet that meant you pretty much had the roll of toilet paper in your lap when sitting down! There was never a time when a staff member held open a door, even in the pouring rain. We found them doing everything from texting on their phones to talking to each other. On the positive side, the loacation is perfect and the bartender provided wonderful advice (as well well made drinks.) As a gluten-intolerant, the carb busters breakfast at the hotel restaurant was perfect!"
40,1886,"Jul 29 2009 	Great Location but watch the construction next door	My friends and I booked 2 rooms thru Priceline and got a great rate for a 4-star hotel in Manhattan. We arrived about 1:00 pm on a Thursday, and gave the car to the valet. Valet parking (there is no on-site parking garage) is $40 per day. We were immediately checked-in to our 2 rooms. They gave us 2 rooms on the 12th floor, but both faced a building under construction next door. Biggest problem with this was not having a view, but there was also a little bit of noise Friday morning that woke us up. There was no construction going on over the weekend.The room was nice in all aspects except for the small tube TV in the armoire. You would think a hotel this nice would have upgraded to a flat-screen TV by now! But we only watched the TV for weather updates and news at night. I also didn't like the &quot;limpy&quot; pillows that I had on my king bed.Location is great - 1 block from a few subway stations, and 2 blocks from Rockefeller Plaza.There was a street fair going on the Sunday morning we checked out, so it took over 45 mins to get our car out of the Valet. But all employees, from the valet to the front desk personnel were very nice and courteous.As others have said, sign up for the free hotel club (I did it on-line), make sure your reservation has the club #, and you get some nice &quot;freebies&quot;, such as free wi-fi ($10/day value) and free beverage service in your room each morning.My problems were minor, and I did not contact the front desk/housekeeping/manager about them. I am sure they would have been taken care of if I did.We ended up spending a lot of time in Times Square, so next time we will probably spend the extra $20 or $30 per night to get a hotel there."
41,1886,"Jul 26 2009	OK NOT SUPERB	I travel a lot for work so I'm more picky than most hotel guests and for my money, the Omni is just ok. My brother and I stayed at the Omni Berkshire for one night and they could not promise a room with two beds since they were near capacity. They offered us a rollaway bed, which we accepted. When we got back to the room late at night and saw what they delivered we were appalled. It was an old (1960's maybe?) metal cot with exposed springs that folds in half. Something your Aunt Ida would make you sleep on when you were a kid visiting. The mattress was so cheap and foamy soft, that it sagged horribly in the center when you laid on it. Classy! I ended up putting the mattress on the floor and the frame in the hallway for pickup. No one, I mean NO ONE could possibly sleep on this bed comfortably, even if they were 85 pounds. The Omni must get complaints but yet they still wheel the old beds up to unsuspecting guests. A word to the Omnni - it's 2009--buy some air mattresses and ditch the reform school bedding.The furnishings are a bit dated, too. a 19&quot; tube TV and a 1980's radio/CD and CASSETTE minii boombox was set up plus a standard clock radio. I can only assume no one at the Omni owsn an I Pod. Thje rooms are clean and quiet, though so if you spend under $200 a night you should feel all right with Omni: the hotel that got a bit stuck in time."
42,1886,"Jul 26 2009 	Very happy w/ location!	The Omni Berkshire is located on 52nd &amp; Madison which is a GREAT location if you are looking to explore popular NYC attractions. This hotel was quiet - no problem sleeping and the rooms were very nice. Most important, the beds were comfy! My only complaint is we were given a room w/ one King bed and had requested 2 queen beds. They said they didn't have any available. This was the only downside but the staff brought us a roll-away and some extra things to help us w/ the sleeping arrangements."
43,1886,"Jul 20 2009 	Excellent location wonderful staff great room	We stayed at the Omni Berkshire for a long weekend to attend a Yankees game and do some sightseeing. We booked through an online discounter and got a great rate. The hotel is in a perfect location for Midtown tourist attractions - a few short blocks to Rockefeller Center, around the corner from St. Patrick's Cathedral, a few short blocks from Grand Central. We got to the hotel very early (11 am) and they were great about getting us the room we wanted (King, No Smoking) and we were checked right in. When we mentioned that we were going to the Yankees game that night the desk clerk said, hang on, I'll check the weather for you, and told us the gametime forecast was for rain. How thoughtful was that - we took our umbrellas and sure enough, it poured but we were prepared. The concierge was fastastic - any questions were answered quickly and her recommendations for lunch and dinner were perfect. Room was surprisingly large, very clean, and very comfortable. We've stayed in NYC many times but have never had a room so spacious. Even on the 4th floor the street noise was no problem - great windows. Business center offered free boarding pass printing, fitness room was nice, although we didn't use it, and 17th floor outdoor deck was a great place for a few minutes of rest in the sun before our next adventure. All in all, a wonderful place to stay in a wonderful city."
44,1886,"Jul 17 2009 	Wonderful charming hotel	I stayed here for 5 nights. This is an excellent hotel. Nicely furnished, polite and helpful staff, free wireless internet and morning beverages when you sign up for guest reward program.Also features nightly turn down with ice service (not something you see in large chains). Bathrobes, nice towels, and a great marble bathroom.The exercise room is basic but very clean and nicely kept. Great spa bathrooms there as well. Also there is a sun deck for guest use on that level, which is a wonderful hidden surprise.The lobby bar is comfortable, stylish and serves great martinis. did not try the restaurant but it looked inviting.I did not want to leave, and would certainly stay here again."
45,1886,"Jul 16 2009 	Be Careful when Booking Package Deals with Omni	Booked a one night stay with Omni in Philadelphia followed by a two night stay in Omni Berkshire Place in New York. Both bookings were made directly on the Omni website.To make things easier and less stressful, I booked a package deal for both stays which included breakfast and valet parking. Unfortunately, both hotels charged me more than the price quoted on their website and secondly, they charged be again for valet parking - without telling me. It was only by chance that I noticed this on my credit card statement. For one hotel to mistakenly bill me for valet parking can be forgiven but for both Omni hotels to make the same mistake in three days is inexcusable. This makes me believe that the package deals are a bit of a con and unless you're clever/lucky enough to spot the double charges then Omni are on to a winner.Unlike the Independence Park Hotel (in Philadelphia) the room was small, the hotel was very stuffy and the bell boys were almost begging for tips. In addition, they never paid any attention to my select guest profile needs.This hotel was a complete rip-off."
46,1886,"Jul 15 2009 	Wonderful!	My husband and I just returned from NYC and spent four nights at the Omni Berkshire Place. I have stayed at two other Omnis and have wanted to stay at this one for years, but the rates just weren't within our budget. Whenever I plan a trip tp NY I check their rates, and this time they were within my range. Now my only complaint is that I'm spoiled for any place else! We got out of our taxi and a bellman immediately whisked our luggage into the hotel. Everyone that we dealt with during our stay at this hotel was pleasant and competent. We had a small problem with our AC. When I called the front desk a maintenance person was at our door within minutes and when I told him we'd had problems since checking in the day before he asked why we waited so long to call! Our room was spotless and up tp date. It was a standard room and was big enough for a king bed, small couch, chair and ottoman and desk, among other things. The location, right around the corner from 5th Ave.. was perfect. Our entire experience at this hotel was positive. I can't say enough good things about it and the staff. My only negative comment is that when people start travelling more again and rates go back up, I won't be able to afford it!"
47,1886,"Jul 15 2009 	Could not fault this Hotel - great value	We stayed here for 3 nights. We pre registered with the select guest programme, the robes and pillows were as requested and the free early moring refreshments were very welcome. The staff were helpful and polite and we could not find any fault with the hotel. We were even allowed to use the heath suite to freshen up at the end of the day after checking out. I would recommend this hotel based upon our recent experience."
48,1886,"Jul 8 2009 	Great hotel experience	This is a beautiful hotel, in a great location and fantastic value for money. I was in New York over night with my husband and two small children and our suite was spacious, and very comfortable. The staff was wonderful and the children received complimentary gift bags and cookies with milk. Nice touch! The valet parking was a HUGE help. I would love to stay here again soon."
49,1886,"Jul 7 2009 	A hard act to follow	We stayed at the Omni the weekend of April 25th. We were lucky the weather was gorgeous because the Omni is so perfectly located we walked everywhere. Our room was amazing and we couldn't believe how huge it was. The sitting room was beautifully furnished as was the bedroom. The bathroom was marble and well laid out. All of the staff was friendly and very accommodating. We liked the atmosphere at the bar and Phillipe makes the most delicious drinks. A special thanks to Lenny, for making us feel so welcome from start to finish. This was the first of several weeks of traveling for my husband and me and we were sorry this was our first stop because we knew none of the other hotels (also 5 stars) would be anywhere near as fabulous. We can't wait to stay at the Omni again."
50,1886,"Jul 6 2009 	Older hotel	We traveled to NYC for 4th of July. When we arrived the lobby looked dated and this theme continued into our room. We booked a Madison Suite, the bed was hard and the ac was not very cold. The bathroom was wonderful, and the ladies @ concierge were great, but the men are very snooty. We were just very let down by the hotel&gt;"
51,1886,"Jun 30 2009 	Fabulous Service Wonderful stay!	I am in my mid thirties and I went to New York City for three nights with my mother and my five-year-old neice. We had such a great stay at this hotel. Before I arrived I noticed that my already low special rate went down in price. I spoke to the manager and she informed me that it was a mistake, but that they would honor it without a problem. Not only did they honor the lower rate, but they also upgraded us to a one bedroom corner suite outlooking Madison Ave and then the manager called up to us to make sure we were happy. It was beautiful and huge! My neice loved the double doors going into the bedroom! The room had a king size bed which me and my mom slept in and I asked them for a cot so that we could easiy put my niece to sleep at night and me and my mom could hang out in the front sitting area and not wake her. What a truly wonderful hotel experience! The staff were so nice to my neice and they gave us a back-pack full of trinckets which she loved. I lived in NYC for ten years and have been back many times, but this truly was my best hotel experience! My mom and my niece keep asking me when we will go back!"
52,1886,Jun 29 2009 	great location and friendly staff	Not cheap but - great location for shopping and sight seeing. We had the luxury bedrooms so can only comment on these rooms. Comfortable and no sound proofing problems - i even took ear plugs with me just in case (after reading reviews). Very friendly staff that cant do enough for you! Would stay here again as location and friendliness makes it a top choice!
53,1886,"Jun 27 2009 	Fantastic Honeymoon....	Myself and my partner booked the hotel through Expedia due to a fantastic 5 night offer that they had on. The hotel from the pictures looked great and just what we were after for our Honeymoon in New York, we booked a Deluxe Double room but on arrival at the hotel we were instantly upgraded to a suite, as it was a special occasion. The staff were extremely helpful and very polite, it was nice when the door staff recognised us as the Honeymoon couple. The room was immaculate so clean and very large, we could not believe our luck when we found out we were also on the 18th floor away from all of the noise from the traffic on the streets below. The location was perfect we walked to most places and it was in the heart of everything, 5 minutes to Times Square, right on fifth avenue, 5 mins to central park- where you can pick up the red tour buses that also take you round all of the sights (Tip- we were there for 5 nights and the tour bus only offers a 3 day bus pass, ask for 4 days if you are staying longer that 3 days as they upgrade to 4 days from 3 free of charge, otherwise it is an extra $40 per day per day). Nothing was ever a problem for the hotel, we also received a complementary drinks service in the morning which was very nice, breakfast is expensive in the hotel but there is a lovely deli right over the road, Isadoras and they do fantastic Bagels. On our final day we received our mini bar bill....we had not used the mini bar and looked like the previous guests bill, my husband spoke to reception and instantly the issue was resolved with no hassle. I have to say this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in and I have already recommended it to our friends who are looking to book a trip to New York very soon. Thank you to the staff at Omni Berkshire Place for making our Honeymoon so special and one to remember."
54,1886,"Jun 26 2009 	My Favorite Hotel in NYC	Since October 2008 I have spent 33 nights in this hotel. The staff are welcoming, courteous and genuinely kind. Rooms are lovely with marble bathrooms and luxury amenities. In addition the location is fantastic! I can't say enough good things about this hotel so I show it with my loyalty: since October 2008, I've stayed in NYC 35 nights, 33 of them at the Omni Bershire - the 2 night difference was only because the hotel was booked solid."
55,1886,"Jun 24 2009 	Select Guest Perks	Joined Select Guest last year after reading all reviews on TripAdvisor, received 50% off room coupon in mail, and was able to stay at the Omni Bershire for a bargain weekend rate of $120 per night. In addition, got a free Sunday Times ($5) and free pot of coffee and tea ($15). Hotel has great midtown location, next door to 5th Ave shopping, bars, and great east side restaurants. Room was small but had very comfortable king bed and bathroom was huge with all amenities. Housekeeping staff is very attentive and turndown service every night is great. Will stay again."
56,1886,"Jun 23 2009 	good but not great	i booked two rooms via bidding on priceline and received reservations at the omni berkshire. after reading several reviews on trip advisor i was relieved to find that overall comments were positive. this hotel definitely is geared towards a family/older population. the concierge staff are nice but are older and good for information re. tourist things, but not nightlife. furthermore, the gym was quite impressive with fairly update cardio equipment and a small weight section . plus GREAT location in march (3 months before my trip) i completed the omni select guest form online to make known my preference of room (double beds) in addition to signing up for free wifi for each room,newspapers everyday and complimentary drinks in the morning, in addition to bottled water upon arrival. a week ahead of my trip i called to confirm that i had two double rooms booked. unfortunately, they were all booked up despite my request in march! i called several times before arriving in new york to see if they had any open double rooms. when i arrived at the hotel, the front desk staff was very helpful.. there was only one double room open.. so they upgraded the other room to a king and offered us a cot free of charge. despite signing up for the select guest... my group received 3 newspapers for the week, no water upon arrival and no complimentary beverages in the mornings.. we did get our wifi internet as requested... but you have to sign in with your user name and password each time you want to use it.. (got a bit annoying after a week..)the only other negative thing i have to say is that after we checked out and returned home, my friend was charged $1300 for her hotel fee despite us already prepaying via priceline. she was not given any receipt to acknowledge this charge and didn't recognize the mistake till she received her credit card statement. it took them about 4 days to correct"
57,1886,"Jun 21 2009 	Lovely hotel lovely staff fabulous location	I stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place this weekend, more than 25 years after my first visit there. The Omni reservations line was very helpful in securing a room, and my expectations were exceeded upon arrival with a lovely, large room with two double beds facing 52nd st. The room was extremely quiet, well furnished, with nice bathroom and comfortable beds. Everyone was so friendly, something one doesn't expect in NY. The guests were really friendly, too. The front desk staff and concierge desk were really nice and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in ensuring the comfort of their guests. Omni's Select Guest program has several nice advantages. We found the location to be perfect, and always felt we had returned to a bit of a haven when we returned at night. The bar at Fireside was accomodating and pleasant with nice staffers. This is a very pleasant, reliable, and nice hotel in a fabulous location at a reasonable price."
58,1886,"Jun 16 2009 	Very nice hotel	I reserved online two weeks in advance and then checked the room prices a few days before we were scheduled to arrive. Rate had gone down $40 per night so I called and a very helpful lady adjusted the room rate. Location slightly on the east side is very good. Subway stop on the same block. Lots to do within walking distance; shops, Museum of Modern Art, Central Park. Check-in went smoothly. Room was small but ok. Seemed to be in very good condition although I prefer contemporary decor; this was not. Nice blow dryer. I do love that the windows opened. Lots of counter space in the bathroom. There was a baseboard heater that kept the bathroom toasty warm on the rainy days in NY. I like the guest program's coffee delivery service in the morning. Very overpriced in-room bar and snacks. Used express checkout and we were on our way. I like the noon checkout time.We'd stay here again."
59,1886,"Jun 12 2009 	Great Location very clean nice large rooms and Great Management	We were traveling together with 2 families for a total of 7 people. I emailed management before arrival to requests certain accomodations. Management responded with an email that everything possible would be done to accomodate us and this was true. The only requests not fufilled was no view, as we were on 7th floor but that was ok as we did not spend much time in our rooms anyway. We arrived, rooms were not ready but they stored our luggage for us. Check in was smooth when we did arrive back. Again, we toured New York and spent very little time in our hotel but when we were there it was very relaxing. Location is great! Rooms were spotless, large and extremely nice. Housekeeping did a wonderful job and the doormen were helpful. I want to mention especially William who went above always speaking to us, holding traffic for us to cross the street, hailing a taxi and just extremely friendly. He is a plus to this hotel! We would stay here again and recommend it due to the location, rooms and management. In this day and time it is refreshing to experience a business who really cares and wants you to be happy!"
60,1886,Jun 12 2009 	Omni has a perfect location	Omni provides excellent ambience and access to the business district. The staff is very courteous
61,1886,"Jun 10 2009 	LOVE the Omni Berkshire	Arrived early but still had our room ready. the room was a good size for NYC and very clean. Our view was not the greatest, but I did not ask for a room with a view. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The maids could not do enough for us. We never had such prompt and excellent service. The concierge was probably the best we ever encountered. I just cannot say enough about the staff at this hotel. The bar as usual in a hotel was a bit over priced compared to other places we stopped in at.. The papers in the morning were fantastic and the coffee and tea delivered to the room in the AM was wonderful. We also received bottled water in the room the first night of our stay. They turned down the bed everynight and the room was always perfect nomatter when we came back to it. You could tell it had been attended to."
62,1886,Jun 6 2009 	Absolutely no complaints!	We stayed for 5 nights over the Memorial weekend. Good sized room with 2 queen beds as we had requested. Definitely sign up for the free internet and coffee service plus free paper delivered when you request. Friendly staff from concierges to cleaners. Excellent location for shops and sights. Little bit noisy at night but you are in the centre of Manhattan and we got to see Nicolas Cage filming in the street!. Isadora's across the road very useful for snacks etc. Had worst breakfast at Prime Burger opposite St Patrick's ...had best breakfast at Madison's on 3rd Avenue. Enjoyed two late nights at the Fireside bar - pricey but decent measures! Would definitely return.
63,1886,"Jun 1 2009 	Not great - Not horrible.	We are frequent travlers and I was excited that we got an Omni hotel on PriceLine. Ended up landing this one for a 5 night trip for $150 a night. So not bad. Check in was quick, the lobby was clean and straight forward and the location of the hotel cannot be beat. We upgraded to the superior room since PriceLine always only gets every hotel's sub-par room. The room fealt very out dated, and Motel 6ish. The bathroom was also very small. The TV is old, small and off to the side (I have come to expect a nice big flat screen from any 4 star hotel we stay at these days). Here is the strangest thing: On our first night of arrival we went to jump into bed and quickly realized that there was only a bottom sheet and comforter, meaning the comforter rest atop your body. The same public comforter used by every guest...this was unacceptable so I quickly phoned the front desk, and they ran a sheet up to us and told me that although they never provide a top sheet he would make sure the maids were made aware of our preference and would leave a top sheet for the remainder of our trip. Well they went 2 for 4 and we had to call for a top sheet on 2 other nights. Very strange."
64,1886,"May 29 2009 	Excellent Service - Would Highly Recommend	My husband and I recently traveled to NYC to celebrate our one year anniversary. We booked through Priceline. A week or so before my husband called to ask if they would upgrade our room if others were available. When we arrived we found out we had been upgraded from a regular room to a junior suite on the 20th floor! The view was great and we were extremely pleased with the size of the room. We signed up for the select guest program and received coffee and juice in our room every morning along with free wi-fi and my husband had two shirts pressed for free. The concierge was very helpful with suggestions for places to eat, shows to see, and especially use of the subway system. All of the staff were very friendly in general. We ordered room service once and it was delivered promptly, set up for us, and tasted delicious. We also ate in the restaurant connected to the hotel once and enjoyed that as well. The location is great also - close to restaurants, subway, shopping (fifth ave is about 1/2 a block away), and tourist attractions. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC."
65,1886,"May 27 2009 	Excellent Location 	Hotel was clean and Staff,especially Yumi, took great care of us. We were able to check in early, and everyone was very friendly. 5 minute walk to Rockefeller, 15 to Broadway, and 20 to Times Square. Felt very safe in the neighborhood. Area was not as loud and busy as Times Square, which was a plus. We could walk to the busy sections easily, but could &quot;get away&quot; when we returned to the hotel."
66,1886,"May 26 2009 	Good Stay	My fiance and I stayed at the Omni for the Memorial Day weekend. We found the hotel to be very accomidating and the servce was very friendly. We checked in late on Friday night and found the lady at the front desk to be very helpful. In general, I found the front desk personnel to be very helpful the entire stay. Overall, I enjoyed the stay here, the location is centrally located and I would stay here again."
67,1886,"May 9 2009 	Central Location Very comfortable bed Would Return	My wife &amp; I stayed here this past April. She had a business meeting, I tagged along to see NYC. The Berkshire Omni is located a block from Rockefeller Place between Madison &amp; 5th Ave. I cannot comment on parking as we arrived from JFK via taxi. Check in was easy. The rooms were small (standard for big-city hotels) but clean &amp; with full amenities. For example, full ironing board, nice hairdryer, mini-fridge, safe, etc. The bath was nice - lighted shaving mirror &amp; excellent showerhead. Quality toiletries. Wireless internet in rooms for no cost - nice touch! The beds were superior - soft linens &amp; super soft (while firm enough). I did not have time to check out the exercise room (it was too nice to work out inside). The staff were friendly. Beds were turned down &amp; chocolate drink &amp; cookies were provided. Newspapers were at the door in the morning. During rush-hour, it was hard to get a cab out front, but the doorman tried very hard! Fortunately, the subway is 1 min away &amp; took me everywhere. The area felt very safe even at night &amp; there were loads of things to see nearby (Central Park, Rockefeller Center, NBC, 5th Ave Shops, Time Square, NY Public Library...the list goes on). Good location for business or pleasure. Would stay again. Also - desk staff held our labtop in the manager's office the day we checked out -- very easy and helpful."
68,1886,"May 8 2009 	Great Value property and location	Stayed here with family for two nights for a New York weekend. It's not the Plaza but it is a wonderful hotel and an even more wonderful staff. They did their best to accommodate every request. The concierge was wonderful in helping me find directions on the subway to an address in Brooklyn and the doormen secured a car to the airport without a problem and for a reasonable rate.It's a great location, close to everything. Breakfast at Burger Heaven on 53rd (right around the corner) was wonderful for next to nothing. Close to the Park, Rock Center, practically on 5th Ave, and two subway stations that can get you anywhere. I'll stay here again."
69,1886,"May 1 2009 	OK but would not stay here again	I have visited New York a few times and when doing so I like to stay in and experience different hotels.The primary reason I selected this hotel was due to it's location, which is good and has been positively commented on in detail in other reviews. The hotel itself is showing signs of age , particulalry in the public areas. We were initially allocated a room on the 13th floor, unlucky for some. This room was overlooked by a building site which was in very close proximity to the room and was very noisy. This was not acceptable and we requested a room change. Initially we were offered a room on a smoking floor, again not ideal for us. After a bit of persistence we were moved, or to be more precise we moved ourselves to a room on the 8th floor at the front of the hotel. Not much of a view either, but the room was a reasonable size and the fittings and fixtures were in good condition. Although, the showers could really do with updating. I was concerned traffic noise might have been a problem being on such a low floor, however we weren't disturbed.Initially, we didn't find the hotel staff particulalry helpful, a couple of times we had to hail our own taxi, not a major problem I know. I also requested the concerige confirm a restaraunt reservation while we were out during the day, surprisingly this wasn't done for us despite me having written all the details down for them. Although on the last day the doormen were very friendly and helpful. Would I stay here again, no, this hotel is not a five star property, it's three star plus, as a result it is comparatively overpriced. It strong point is it's location, but this is New York, there are a number of better quality hotels in the vicinity. If you are visiting New York for a special occasion and want to stay somewhere to remember, then look elsewhere. If you're visiting with friends or a repeat visitor and just need a room, you could do worse but, you could do better."
70,1886,"Apr 25 2009 	Clean great location super staff	Visited NYC with six friends last weekend. Paid $220/night for a spacious (even by non-NYC standards) well appointed room. Room 1602 is a corner room with entry vestibule, love seat (not a pull out), desk, chair/ottoman, wardrobe, king bed and large bathroom. Hotel staff was terrific. The only glitch we ran into was that we had booked four rooms with two double beds each - even calling twice to confirm - but all that was 'left' at 2:00pm when we checked in were king-bedded rooms. Two roommates chose to have rollaways, which fit fine in the room. Hotel is extremely well located."
71,1886,"Apr 24 2009 	Very friendly large rooms excellent location	We were very well greeted at the Omni and provided with a beautiful upgrade to a marvellous corner room. The room was spacious and well appointed.Location of the hotel is excellent, both for business and shopping."
72,1886,Apr 22 2009 	Omni Berkshire Equals Quality	We recently stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place and we would return to this hotel the next time we are in NYC. Our reservation was handled with great efficiency and a positive attitude by the front desk employees. We had booked the Spring Promo rate of two nights stay with the third night free. Our large premier room had a city view. The best part of the stay were the two doormen William and Lenny. These two gentlemen were at their best when meeting each person who entered or left the hotel. Each day they offered their &quot;Good morning to you&quot; and &quot;How can I be of help?&quot; They provided good information regarding places to see and go to in NY as well as directions. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends and I look forward to returning there the next time we are in NY.
73,1886,"Apr 21 2009 	Great hotel great staff	My wife and I stayed in this hotel for two nights. I got the hotel via Priceline for $115 per night. Prior to travelling I signed up for their select guest programme and emailed them to see if this could be associated with my booking and if I would be entitled to complimentary wi-fi, all of which they did.The location couldn't be better for midtown, just yards form 5th Avenue. The rooms are large by NYC standards, clean and in good condition. The staff were professional and friendly and, as I requested, contacted me as soon as my delayed luggage arrived. My one warning is the cost of phone calls. I need to call my credit card company in the UK and two fifteen minute calls cost about $60 each. The room directory does point out that they will be charged at collect rate + 50%, but gives no indication just how much this is. At check out I mentioned that this was rather high and asked if anything could be done about it. The lady went away to check and when she came back said she could reduce the cost bt 40% which I was more than happy with. This hotel exceeded my expectations and I would have no hesitation in recommending it. The Omni will definitely be at the top of my list for future visits to New York."
74,1886,"Apr 16 2009 	Perfect location	This hotel is in a great location, very convenient. Our room was rather large and very clean but we had a terrible view (a pile of debris). However, we did not spend much time in the room looking out the window. Bellmen were great and concierge staff were very helpful. Fireside Restaurant was suprisingly good. Would definitely stay here again."
75,1886,"Apr 14 2009 	Medicore service in an older hotel w/large rooms	The rooms are larger than expected. The bathrooms have exceptional water pressure and spacious. The hotel is older and shows some of it's wear but still it's very clean. Here's the rub though. Don't ask the staff for anything...and I mean ANYTHING out of the ordinary.Here are two examples. First, I was in the lounge and was seated by a party with several children. I asked to be moved and was met with &quot;NO&quot;. The waiter then marched off to never return in a half empty room. Secondly, I disliked the first room I was assigned because it faced a construction site. At first ,the staff rebuffed my request. Finally, they relented and told me that would allow me to switch rooms.The front desk staff moved me but they made me work for it. They seemed to take delight in the fact I was powerless and practically had to beg them for help. As punishment for being so brazen and asking for a room change they made me wait four hours. Average at best."
76,1886,"Apr 14 2009 	Superb at the right price!	As a family of six we stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place in 3 Doubles for a week in April and had a brilliant time. The hotel is definately a 4* property with the service you would expect. Although it has about 250 rooms it feels like a much smaller hotel as each floor only has 35 rooms and there are plenty of lifts/elevators, and we could not fault any of the staff a single time, as everyone from doormen and receptionists to the housekeeping staff were excellent, and although all impeccably behaved, none had the prententious attitude you sometime get in luxury hotels - just plain friendly.The rooms were very large by NYC standards, even though we made our booking on Priceline and got our rooms at about half of the rate advertised on the hotels own website for the dates we stayed, and so were allocated standard rooms. We emailed in advance to ask for rooms as high up as possible, as traffic noise can be an issue at night in some NYC locations, and were given rooms on the 16th floor, which was great. If you pay $300 per night, you might expect something even better than us, and so should choose to stay in a 5* hotel like the Ritz Carlton or Mandarin Oriental.The decor is very old-world, and although incredibly well maintanied, the hotel shows it's age with extensive use of marble, old-fashioned ceiling cornice, brass everywhere and small lifts. So if you prefer your hotels Philippe Stark cool, this might not be the best choice for you.Being on the corner of Madison Avenue and 52nd street, 5th Avenue with all the high end shop is 30 seconds walk west, and Park Avenue with all its offices is no more than a minute east. The location is good if you are in New York as a tourist, as all the Midtown shops, Times Square and the park etc. are within walking distance, and several subway stops are around the corner to go up or downtown. The doormen were also always happy to get taxis for us in an instant when it rained, so this would be a great choice as a base for a first trip to the city.All in all, a superb hotel in a superb city and we would definately return if we could get as good a deal again!"
77,1886,"Apr 13 2009 	Great hotel in great location	My family booked 2 rooms over Easter, and we could not have been treated better by the hotel staff. Our room was upgraded to a suite, and I received birthday greetings and strawberries upon arrival! Many of our friends also stayed at the hotel, and everyone enjoyed their room and the wonderful location of the hotel."
78,1886,"Apr 13 2009 	Excellent Hotel great location amazing value	Stayed here for 5 nights and were impressed by this well managed hotel; great (if not huge) rooms, clean, quiet (at 18th fl) and well appointed. perfect location just round the corner from Moma, 5th Av, Rockefeller Center etc. And absolutely amazing value with a $140 rate found online. This hotel is at the top of the list for next NYC visits, business or leasure."
79,1886,"Apr 12 2009 	Never again thanks.	This hotel is not what it used to be, that's for sure. We reserved two double rooms for Easter weekend, with a request for early check-in. Not only did we NOT get early check-in, but our rooms were not available until one hour AFTER the regular check-in time. And we didn't get our two double rooms - they only had one double and one king. This wouldn't have been so bad if not for the careless attitude of the front desk staff, who basically shrug their shoulders and say &quot;sorry, but we're really busy&quot;....When we finally got to our rooms, they were stuffy, small, and in sore need of updating. I understand the hotel is due for renovation, but that doesn't excuse the lack of pillows (two pillows in a room with two full beds?), or the worn out sheets with holes in them. TV's are ancient, and incidentals are overpriced. $50/night for parking?? $6 for a small bottle of water??? For the prices charged, you expect at least to have bedding that doesn't make you cringe. I notice the management has a stock response to complaints, indicating that renovations are due soon, but they do not address the very poor attitude of most of the staff. My husband and I got the impression that the front desk staff don't like being there any more than we did, and it shows."
80,1886,"Apr 10 2009 	Just Horrible	Starting at check in with brain dead Front Desk agents who could not operate a computer. The bellman had his hand out from the get go. The tv's in the room were 20 tube set circa 1980. The room smelled like clorox bleach. Hallways were filthy with vacuum cleaners left as ornaments in the hall all day. Never used. Cleaning supplies left on window sills outside guest rooms.Toilet paper, glasses, linen in open view. I could not wait to check out of this dump."
81,1886,"Apr 9 2009	Not worth the money	The quality of the room, and room furnishings were extremely disappointing. I have stayed at the Chicago Omni, and expected the same quality in the Berkshire. I was very disappointed. When I explained my dissatisfaction to the front desk, their reaction was there was nothing they could do. Two different types of hotels - therefore two different types of furnishings. I was not even offered an apology, nor given any type of resolution. The front staff attitude was very disappointing. I also had an inncident of a staff member opening my door, and entering my room without invitation. I also reported this to the front desk. Again, no explanation, or apology. I was delivered a dessert as an apology the next day - but that token was far from helping satisfy me. Also, the front staff did not explain that there was complimentary morning beverage service tickets. I happened to see the tickets on the 3rd day of my stay. Again, very disappointing."
82,1886,"Apr 9 2009 	Great Location	This hotel is in a fantastic location. Easy walking distance to Rockefeller Plaza, Time Square, best of all for a family who loves basketball 2 mins walk to the NBA store. No need for a car as Public Transport in New York is fantastic and cheap (compared to Australia). We stayed over Christmas and New Years and street was quiet only sound the garbage trucks. Room was small but clean, enough room for the two double beds and with four of us a bit more room would have been good. Furniture a bit outdated. We stayed in 5 Omni Hotels during our trip and this probably was the smallest but I would stay here again as the location was a big plus. Room service food was nice and there was a cafe acros the road which had great pizza , open for breakfast as well."
83,1886,"Apr 7 2009 	Good value	This hotel has an excellent location, and the rooms are reasonably pleasant. I got a very good rate through Hotwire (didn't know this was the place until we'd paid), so for under $200 per night, it was a great bargain. If it were priced similarly to other hotels, I'd be fine with it, but I'd be equally fine with many other places."
84,1886,"Apr 6 2009 	Fabulous hotel in NYC	I've stayed at the Omni Berkshire with my boyfriend three times now and won't stay anywhere else! The hotel is in a great location, right along Madison Avenue and close to several subway strops. I always find the bellmen to be very cool and friendly, and the front desk staff professional and accommodating. The housekeeping staff is extremely diligent--we usually leave the privacy sign up so we can sleep in late, and every day, there is a voicemail from housekeeping letting us know that we can call down and have our room cleaned whenever it's convenient for us. The beds are very comfortable--a great thing to have when you've been walking around the city all day! We usually get a small amenity (chocolate covered pretzels and bottled water) when we stay, probably because we are members of their select guest program. Most of the other Omnis don't do that! Again, the staff and the location are fabulous. The rooms are pretty nice--the only downside is that some of them don't have very nice views, but those facing Madison Avenue or 52nd are quite lovely! I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
85,1886,"Mar 29 2009 	Great Location Good Value	Spent an extended weekend in New York bargain-hunting at the end of February. I didn't think I could afford it, but Expedia had some great deals, and we were able to pick the Berkshire Place for our stay. I have always wanted to try this hotel, primarily for the location. We requested a room with 2 double beds, but were given a large double room facing Madison Ave, on a low floor. I was worried about street noise, as I'm a light sleeper, but there were no problems. Room decor is fairly unimaginative, but clean, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine. As I said, the location is the main selling point. Minutes from Sak's, Rockefeller Center, St Patrick's Cathedral, and some really great restaurants. The Four Seasons is further east on 52nd, and just west of Fifth ave. you'll find 21, where we stopped for some drinks and ended up saying hello to Bill and Hillary Clinton! Negative- business center charges almost $10 for 15 MINUTE increments should you need to use a computer. Be sure and join the Omni frequent guest program before you go, and in-room wi-fi is free.All in all, I would stay at the Berkshire Place again if I were able to get a similarly great deal. I loved the location, and I am frankly mystified as to why Sofitel's rates were so much higher than they were last Feb when I stayed there. Apparently the economic downturn hasn't affected them..."
86,1886,"Mar 27 2009 	Omni Berkshire-great location-great room.	Went into NYC to see Jersey Boys. Valet parked and went to our room early without a hitch. Quite a large room for NY on 21st floor. Beautiful bath with whirlpool tub and pink marble shower. Beds were sumptuous. TV was a little dated. Wonderful, upscale neighborhood, surrounded by great stores and restaurants and walking distance to theatre."
87,1886,Mar 24 2009 	Absolutely perfect for us!	We stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place for 3 nights earlier this month and it really couldn't have been any better. My wife and I had never been to New York so location was my primary reason for booking this hotel. The location is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else...between 5th Ave. and Madison Ave...what else can you really say? Everyone was friendly and helpful. The bed was unbelievably comfortable. I normally can't sleep in hotels because most mattresses are either too soft or too hard. These were perfect. My wife and I will be back in NYC later this year and we will be staying at the Omni Berkshire Place!
88,1886,"Mar 17 2009	Excellent Location Good Hotel	I just returned from a four night stay at the Omni Berkshire with my parents. The location, as many other reviewers have noted, is one of the best. This is my second trip to New York and I highly recommend staying in Midtown if you are traveling for leisure, particularly near 5th Avenue (the Omni's location is right in between 5th and Madison). This hotel is arguably a good value for the location; a four night stay was in between the prices for the Grand Hyatt Central Station and the Waldorf-Astoria on Expedia and I booked via the Omni website!Unfortunately, the devil is in the details at this hotel; some aspects are excellent while others quite poor. The sound insulation in between the rooms is nonexistent. Every night we could hear our neighbors (from different rooms). The first night a couple returned to their room (at 2 a.m.) and kept us awake until 4 a.m. until I shouted at them to be quite. The second and third mornings (at around 6 or 7 a.m.) we could hear children's conversations next door. We could also hear when our neighbors took showers as if they were using the bathroom in our own room.A minor issue that we encountered is the lack of outlets in the room itself (there are two in the bathroom and only one accessible one in the bedroom). Further, although the room had three phones (two in the bedroom and one in the bathroom) only one worked. Positive details include the very comfortable beds, excellent bathroom layout (there's a lot more shelving storage than you expect at first glance), and very kind and helpful staff. This hotel is almost a boutique hotel due its small size. Fireside, the restaurant and lounge, has very good food in the lounge and for room service, but is overpriced relative to comparable options in the neighborhood. Overall, I'm not sure if I would stay at this hotel again only because of the poor sound insulation. However, if I could book at a relatively low price (as compared to nicer options, such as the Waldorf Astoria) I would consider visiting the Omni Berkshire Place again."
89,1886,"Mar 17 2009 	Loved the Omni!!	I just got back from a long weekend in NY ! We stayed at the omni Berkshire Place, and all I can say is two big thumbs way up!!!!!! From the moment we arrived, to the moment we left, it was nothing but smiles and wonderful customer service. The doormen were super helpful, as was the concierge. The room was great, bed was VERY COMFY and most importantly, SUPER CLEAN! From now on, I plan to only stay at the Omni!"
90,1886,"Mar 13 2009 	Spring Break W/E with College Kids	Hotel was all we expected it to be. The hotel offered all you might need without yet maintained a very initimate feel. The staff, with the exception of the gentleman at the front desk, was most accomodating and friendly at every turn. The rooms were of generous size for Manhattan, very clean and comfortably furnished - great beds! The bathrooms had great water pressure and updated features. The corner street side room was much noiser than the courtyard room. If sleep is important, forgo the view and extra space for an interior room. The housekeeping and room service staffs were courteous and discreet. Morning coffee service was punctual and steaming. The hotel is a great location for Midtown Manhattan. Situated between 5th and Madison placed us within walking distance of Central Park, Times Square, great shopping, St. Patrick's, and plenty of dining options. The Green Line subway to Union Square and Downtown is accessible within a block's walk. Across the street is Isadora's for beverage and light meal service. The bellmen were friendly and helpful guiding us out each time we came and went. The concierge staff was also terrific; Marilyn, Tino and Randy were most helpful and offered great suggestions for dining, shows, and general tourist info. We had drinks and appetizers in Fireside following the theatre one evening. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxed and everything was to our liking. The staff was very gracious. The business center was terrific in helping to resolve a problem printing boarding passes. They were very patient and it was greatly appreciated. We will return on our next visit most definitely."
91,1886,Mar 3 2009 	Excellent all the way through	Stayed at the hotel for a weekend break. Excellent location and staff who were always knowledgeable and helpful. We were given a room upgrade on our arrival and the room was always serviced well. Good size gym that was open from 5.30 am. Great place for a short or long break.
92,1886,Mar 3 2009 	excellent stay at Omni	We stayed as a family in ths hotel over the February half ternm period.We had a really nice suite allocated on 4th floor.Did not recall any road noise as we were so tired at the end of the day sightseeing.Did not have time to use the facilities for the same reason.We were treated with respect by staff and have no complaints.As with many ate out from breakfast until evening meal.Fantastic location 10-15 minute walk to Broadway and Times Square.
93,1886,"Feb 23 2009 	not perfect but a good find	Stayed at the Omni because of Trip Advisor reviews. Pros: The location is great. I would not want to be any lower than the 5th floor because of street noise; on the 7th we heard buses during the day but at night, when it matters, all was fine. Staff was friendly. If you sign up for Omni rewards, you get free wireless. The room (we had a Premium King room) was big for NYC, the bathroom was updated, the bed was comfortable. The turndown service was nice. We put the privacy sign on the door and were not bothered by housekeeping in the AM.Cons: Oh Liz, fellow 7th floor guest, I now know all about you; your hopes, fears, and your 3AM deep conversations with visitors. I'm sorry I didn't catch your last name through the wall; I don't think your guest knew it either throughout your hour long conversation. This is partly my fault; when I heard how much you were projecting your voice during a cell phone call earlier in the afternoon I should have changed rooms then, instead of assuming you had the manners to speak softly in a hotel during the wee hours. Other Cons (these are MINOR, but for people who care): There was glassware outside our door when we checked in waiting to be collected by housekeeping. It was still there when we checked out. There is some damage to the furniture, a little peeling wallpaper, and the TV could use updating. The phone handset didn't work. The fitness center had several different machines but the only ones turned on were the treadmills. Oh, and parking is two blocks away.For the pricerange in Midtown, this hotel is one of the better ones we've stayed in. The noisy neighbors aren't their fault; but maybe they can add some insulation when they renovate the place."
94,1886,"Jan 28 2009 	Omni Berkshire a special ""Place"" in NYC	We have just returned from a four-night stay at the Omni Berkshire Place. From the moment we arrived we felt at home.It was our fourth visit to New York so we knew our way around and it's location just off 5th Avenue is outstanding.We had junior suite on 19th floor over looking 52nd Street and it was fantastic, the bed was the very comfortable and the turn down in the evening is a lovely touch. The bathroom was quite large by New York standards and lovely. The staff at check in, the bellhops and the maid service are very freindly, not pushy and really made you feel welcome.The Omni also has a Bar and Restaurant called Fireside, we didn't eat in it but the food did look good. We did use the bar each evening and the found the atomosphear lovely and the drinks prices good for a New York hotel.Couple of tips for you, we didnt book breakfast; One blook up on Maddison is the Europe Cafe, these are all over Manhatten and offer great food for breakfast and lunch at super prices. Restaurants in the area to go to: McCormick &amp; Schmick's on 52nd between 6th and 7th Avenues, fantastic sea food at very good prices. China Grill on W 53rd St, again great food but can by pricey. We had a wonderful trip, helped by our stay at the Omni Berkshire Place and next years trip will include a return the Omni, when youve stayed at one of the friendliest Hotels in New York you won't stay anywhere else.If your going to New York and looking at Hotels they are all expensive, but only some offer good value, The Omni Berkshire Place may be a bit more than some but its worth every cent!"
95,1886,"Jan 15 2009	I cannot recommend this hotel	I would not stay here again. The young man at the front desk was impolite to us when we checked in. He was very discourteous for no apparent reason. Other employees were professional but a housekeeper was rude to me because she didn't seem to like me using the lobby bathroom. Encountering unexplained hostility from two of the employees makes me question the management. Also, the doormen/bellmen would stand and talk and watch us but not open the heavy doors for my wife who was trying to push a stroller and carry bags (and it was often raining during our stay so we were struggling with umbrellas even while they would cooly stand and watch without opening the doors or even acknowledging us). The room was shabby. The foam was sticking out of holes in the upholstery of the chairs. I read that the hotel is planning to be renovated and the rooms are overdue for repair. The rooms are not properly maintained for guests. Our friends' room faced into a dark alley and there was loud construction noise for a long-term project next door right at their window all day. The rudeness of several of the hotel's employees and the rough room really detracted from our otherwise wonderful trip."
96,1886,Jan 3 2009 	Ok stay in the Big Apple	The Omni Berkshire offers a nice location to 5th Ave and Rockefeller Center. The suite we booked was not available so we were offered a downgrade to a smaller room. Our children had to sleep on a single bed that was set up next to the couch to allow for enough room both in the room and for them to sleep comfortably. The hotel is described as &quot;kid-friendly&quot; and there were families staying at the hotel. The staff was kind but not exceptionally helpful. The hotel restaurant (Fireside) offers an unusual dinner menu that falls short of &quot;fine dining&quot;. The food at the deli across the street from the hotel offered better food and a wait staff that was warm and friendly. Our experience was not unforgettable asit was time spent together as a family but certainly was not 4 star.
97,1886,"Dec 29 2008 	One of the Best	I want to thank the Omni for making our trip to NYC so memorable. My family fell on some hard times right before Christmas and almost had to cancel our trip. We were able to get it together and take our daughters for Christmas. Everyone at the Omni was wonderful. The room was spacious and immaculate. The staff was more than accomodating and very friendly. It will be some time before we are able to get back there, but when we can we will stay at the Omni. Thank you for making our holiday so special."
98,1886,"Dec 28 2008	Omni Berkshire - The good and the not-so-good	Stayed over Christmas weekend with family. Wouldnt necessarily call it a 4-star hotel. Lobby was lovely, service was nice. Location couldn't be beat. Workout room was quite nice. And the bathrooms were spacious. Not so good - walls were like paper (you could hear TVs in the next room), elevators didn't always work (we got stuck the first night we were there), and since we were on the 3rd floor, we could hear traffic and street noise all night. Lots of choices in NYC. Wouldnt pick this one again."
99,1886,"Nov 18 2008 	We loved the Omni Berkshire and will stay there again	We stayed at the Omni Berkshire in October 2007. I totally forgot to leave a review back then. Anyway, our stay was excellent. We arrived late in the day on a friday afternoon. We were immediately upgraded to a suite. Even though our view was a construction site, that did not interfere with our weekend or our sleep time. The suite was a very nice room. It had a living room, a seperate bedroom seperated by french doors and a really nice marble and granite bathroom.The bed was extremely comfortable, and we slept great. There was also a robe in the room but we did not use it.In the morning, we received complimentary coffee and hot chocolate, since we were a member of their select guest club. Downstairs across from the elevator was the concierge. We only used them to recommend a place for breakfast and they also called ahead to leave a reservation for us.On the day we left, we checked out and were able to leave our bags locked up at the hotel while we went out to view the city. All in all it was a great hotel, and a great stay. We will be coming back to the Omni Berkshire very soon."
100,1886,"Nov 11 2008 	Great Location	My partner and I stayed there for a two- week break and loved it. It was really amazing the rooms were a good size, great gym, good turn down service and the staff was friendly-ish (you did have to catch their attention it seems). You can't beat the location for shopping and for getting around, the train is just a block away and you can always grab a cab (or walk ) to where you want to go to. A little pricey but worth it."
101,1886,Oct 30 2008 	Loved it!	After reading the other recent reviews on here think we must have been lucky or I dont know???? We had a fabulous stay first time in NY and we were right in the middle of everything but not noisy at all. Ou room was upgraded when we arrived and my son was very taken by all the yummies and toiletries in the room! STaff were all very very friendly and couldnt do enough for us. Would definitely go back again and recommend!
102,1886,"Oct 27 2008 	Nice hotel great loca	Great location, very clean and quite room. All staff was very polite and helpful. Restaurant had fine food. We had a minor issue with our room lock , but they were very responsive. Make sure you book your trip with Quikbook.com. Best rates I've found (better than orbitz, hotwire, etc). doug"
103,1886,"Oct 6 2008 	Pretty Good NY Hotel	My husband and I just got back from a weekend in New York at the Omni Berkshire Place. We booked our room through Priceline and got a great deal ($225/night). The hotel was centrally located in Midtown--close to Columbus Circle and Central Park. The hotel itself is pretty nice--our room was small (but it is NYC so I was not concerend with the size), nicely decorated and clean. I should mention that if we had paid the actual going rate for this hotel--somewhere in the mid $300's I probablly would have been disappointed, especially with the particular room we were given on the 3rd floor that looked into the hotel's landry room. But since we got a deal and the only time we spent in the room was sleeping, it was just fine. Overall I thought the hotel staff was very nice. There is a concerige desk that set up dinner reservations, theater shows, etc. As I said before the location was great for sightseeing--my husband and I actually walked all the way to the Met, but we are in our late 20's/early 30's and all of our friends were in SoHo and the West Village so we spent a lot of time in cabs. So if you want more action and ambiance in NYC this is probably not the hotel for you."
104,1886,"Oct 4 2008 	Not the best of the Omnis	Just returned from a 4-night stay. I've been a Select Guest member for 4 years, and have stayed in several Omni hotels throughout the country. This was by far the least attractive and least comfortable. My chief complaint is the misleading room photos on the Omni hotel website for this location, showing Superior rooms that bear absolutely NO resemblance to the room you will get. The Omni website for the Berkshire Hotel described the Superior room (upgrade from the &quot;Deluxe&quot;) as a &quot;larger, brighter room facing 52nd Street&quot; and showed photographs of a very attractive, good-sized, richly decorated room with gleaming appointments. Based on this information, I booked a Superior Double Double for two adults and two children via the Omni website. As we were arriving late, I checked in ahead of time via their email early check-in service to guarantee our room. When my family of 4 arrived at 10pm, we were ushered back into a dank, dismal corner of the hotel and opened the door to find we had been given one of their smallest rooms, with a view of a dark and dirty interior alleyway. My heart actually sank - I felt it. What a disappointment! I immediately picked up the phone to ring the front desk, and surprise -- the phone was broken. From the bathroom phone I inquired why we were not given a Superior room, when that was what we had pad for. The front desk's response was that we were indeed in what they classify as a &quot;superior room' (??? How? it was the smallest room in the hotel with an alley view!) but she agreed to move us to another &quot;Superior Room&quot; with more space. We moved to a slightly larger room on the south-facing side of the hotel, so it wasn't so dark, but the decor was absolutely the same as the first -- old, worn, off-kilter, and depressing. Being so tired, we stayed there and tried to make the best of it, but it's no fun feeling like you want to do anything to keep away from returning to your $550 hotel room! On the bright side, the concierges were universally friendly and helpful, as were the housekeeping staff. The doormen, however, would sooner let a lady open the heavy doors by herself on too many occasions.I've noticed the management replies to most reviews here with a boilerplate rubber stamp response. Very unprofessional, and telling. I will definitely NOT stay here again - there are dozens and dozens of better properties in this price range."
105,1886,"Oct 2 2008	Not 5 Star-Maybe 3 Star	Very, very average from start to finish. When we checked in, they tried to palm as off with a smaller room than we had booked and paid for. In the end we changed room four times and ended up with an average room on the third floor. The double glazing is as good as useless, so was very noisy. The alternative to this was overlooking major construction works. Not a cheap hotel, there are many, many better places to stay in New York. The only positive side was the location."
106,1886,"Sep 29 2008 	The Omni felt like our ""second home""!	Our flight got canceled and we had a long layover, so we called the Hotel, if they would hold our room until after midnight. They did and when we arrived at midnight we were greeted and checked in promptly. Our room was amazing and everything we hoped for. Since it was my girlfriends birthday they even put chocolate covered strawberries in the room! The bed was opened already and they left a light on. The bathroom had all the amenities we needed and we also had bathrobes, a free beverage and a newspaper in the morning, since we joined the &quot;Select Guest&quot; program. Such a nice touch!Other reviews mention the noise from other rooms, but we had a room at the end of the floor and no disturbances at all. Our window looked out to Madison Avenue and every now and then you would hear taxis honk, but hey - it's New York! If you need absolute silence, why not look into a hotel on an Island?The love to detail and the friendly staff amazed us from the moment we walked into the Omni Berkshire and we will definitely be back! Thank you so much!"
107,1886,"Sep 17 2008 	They really took care of me!	I was staying at the Omni for a business trip - first of all, I got the exact kind of room I wanted - with 1 king bed, and it was clean, and I was able to extend my stay. Then I happened to develop food poisoning on my first night. The concierge - Beatriz - was amazing, and went to the drug store to get me medicine and gatorade, and took the time to check up on me whenever I walked out the door to make sure that I was okay. All the staff I encountered was friendly and whenever I ordered take-out food, security walked them directly to my door so I didn't even have to go down to get it myself. I would LOVE to stay here again!"
108,1886,Sep 14 2008 	WOW!	From start to finish the entire experience was great. They went over the top in making us feel special during my wife's birthday weekend. The room was adequately sized and exceptionally clean. If you are staying in Manhatten look no further.
109,1886,"Sep 3 2008 	great midtown spot	Do not hestiate staying here if you want a great room at a great location. We have stayed here several times. Once again, staff was excellent. Upon arriving early, they upgraded us to a executive room and offered to set up roll away for daughter.You will find rooms a little larger than most NYC hotel rooms. The size would compare well to the higher end hotels like Plaza, Ritz and Waldorf."
110,1886,Aug 27 2008	Yucky Souvenir From Previous Guest	This stay was a disappointment as opposed to previous ones. We were placed in a room on a low floor (I requested high) with a king bed (I requested two doubles) that had not been cleaned properly (dirty socks on the window sill). We received a bad attitude when we were moved and really bad attitude when they weakly offered to move us to a room with requested bed configuration on the last night. The staff we dealt with were less than enthusiastically professional. I will not be staying there again anytime soon. Back to the Sofitel!
111,1886,"Aug 26 2008 	Loved the Omni	Our family of three had a great stay at the Omni. Situated in midtown Manhattan the hotel is near 2 subway stations, and it's an easy walk to many of the must-see sights and the Theater District. It's an excellent location if you want to avoid the crush of staying near Times Square.The front-desk staff, concierge team, and bellman were professional and helpful. The room was clean and spacious, with very comfortable beds and decent size closet space. The room could use a little updating: not enough dresser space (we were there for 4 nights), and the television is wildly out of date.The hotel amenities are fine, although the bar/lounge is a little gloomy and needs a make-over. We did not have breakfast in the hotel, choosing instead to go to one of at least three nearby cafes. There are many good restaurants in the neighborhood and the concierge will assist with reservations, even at the last minute.We highly recommend the Omni and would stay there again."
112,1886,"Aug 26 2008 	Great late summer stay at the Omni	We just returned from our stay with the Omni in New York. The location is midtown on 52nd, just off Fifth Avenue and convenient to Rockefeller Center, theater and American Girl. We stayed comfortably, in a standard room with 2 double beds, with our 10 year old daughter. The staff is very attentive, with extra attention paid to our daughter - kids gift bag upon arrival. The staff is very friendly and accomodating. We will definately go back."
113,1886,"Aug 17 2008 	Good location outdated decor . . .	We booked a Berkshire Suite for two adults and one small child. The location can't be beat. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room, although fairly large, was definitely not as modern, cheery and inviting as pictured on line. Fairly outdated and very well worn furnishings were kind of depressing, no view, etc. We were on the 17th floor. The carpet was also well worn and seemed pretty dirty (as was evident per the child that was playing on the floor - yuck!). Comp. fruit, newspaper, etc. a nice touch. Very pricey, I expected a more updated room, but I guess that's the risk you take."
114,1886,"Aug 5 2008 	Excellent location and service	I stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place at 52nd and Madison August 1-4. The location cannot be beat for New York! It is on the block between 5th Avenue and Madison. The hotel staff was very accommodating as was the concierge service. It is a busy hotel but extremely well-run. There are two groupings of elevators; one group has 2 and the other 3. So the wait is minimal.The room looks recently refurbished with a king size bed, ottoman and chair in the room. The bath room was all marble, well-lit but maybe a bit small for some guests. Room also has a refrigerator, mini-bar. There is cable service and all the major stations as well as movie channels are offered. I would absolutely stay at the Omni Berkshire again!"
115,1886,"Aug 4 2008 	Excellent choice for mother/daughter getaway	I took my teenage daughter to NYC for her first stay, and chose the Omni after much research. I wanted a safe, convenient location, quiet, clean guestrooms, and good service. We were extremely happy with our choice. Our room was spacious and immaculate, and my request for a high floor (to help a bit with the quiet part ,you are in New York City, after all) was fulfilled. We were treated like royalty by all of the staff, slept well each night in the very comfortable beds, and appreciated the spotless, renovated bathroom. The location can't be beat. So many of the sights you'll want to see are within easy walking distance, and anything else further afield is a quick cab ride away. Sign up for the preferred guest program - we did, because we plan to be frequent Omni customers after our experience here."
116,1886,"Aug 1 2008	Good Hotel very poor service	Difficult review to write. I'll start out with the negatives. We arrived at 11pm having flown in from the Carribbean. I had booked a room for three adults. When we arrived all they had left was a room with a King. They offered a rollaway bed for my 6 foot 2 inch son. They claimed they had no rooms left with more than one bed, including suites and they could not offer a second room. After much arguement, we had no option but to take the room and my sons legs dangled over the end of his very flimsly rollaway bed. For this reason I cannot give this hotel anythin other than a poor rating.They did give us two (although not three) free breakfasts as compensation.However, putting that problem to one side, the hotel is very well located, just off 5th Avenue. The room we stayed in was big, well decorated with a nice new bathroom. I would stay here again, but only if I had ensured that they would hold a proper room for me until I arrived."
117,1886,"Jul 28 2008 	What a wonderful place	We just returned from New York and stayed at the Omni Berkshire Hotel and had a wonderful visit. The hotel is just lovely and is in a fantastic location. I cannot say enough about the staff - everyone was so pleasant and so very accommodating. When we arrived, we had a nice room; however, we were disappointed in the location of the room. The hotel was so crowded the first night that they were unable to move us; however, the next day they moved us to a new room with a nice view that made our stay even more enjoyable. The hotel itself is very attractive and very clean. We definitely will return to the Omni the next time we visit New York."
118,1886,"Jul 24 2008 	Wonderful Hotel!	Just got back from our trip to NYC and our stay at the Omni Berkshire Place Hotel which is in Midtown. I went with my 18 year old daughter who just graduated from high school. We arrived at 12:00 noon and asked if we could check in. I also asked for an upgrade. She did upgrade us, and said our room should be ready in an hour or two. We checked back at 1:30 and checked in. The room was fabulous! King bed, chair w/ottoman, desk, couch. The bathroom was large, especially for NYC standards. Everything was clean and very nicely appointed. A/C worked great, which was important since it was extremely hot &amp; humid in NYC. Hotel personnel were very nice &amp; helpful, as was the concierge. My only negative was that I wish the hotel restaurant was more casual. We ordered room service from there for two mornings. I would have preferred a restaurant like where we stayed before (Hotel Roger Williams). Other negative was plugs. There was one plug that was easy to get to on the lamp on the desk. The others were hard to get to behind a couch and under desk. Would definitely stay there again! Excellent location!"
119,1886,"Jul 24 2008 	Great location - friendly staff	We stayed four nights with our three teenage children who are serious shoppers. This hotel is in the perfect location just off 5th Ave, close to all the big stores and theatres nearby. The rooms are comfortable and of good size. We found the staff at the concierge desk very helpful. Their dinning suggestions were spot on. Avoid breakfast at the hotel which is expensive. There are other local places to get breakfast (burger heaven and the Europa Cafe 2 blocks up Madison were good). We would return."
120,1886,"Jul 22 2008 	great hotel	My family and I just spent a Saturday night at the Omni in New York City. It was a wonderful. Check in was 3:00, but our room was ready when we arrived at 10:00. We were upgraded, and went directly to our room. The room was a nice size, with a king size bed, loveseat and chair. They gave us a complementary roll away for our son. The bathroom was excellent. It was very large and, best of all, immaculate. It appeared recently remodeled with marble tile on the floors and walls in the tub. It was one of my biggest concerns, but this bathroom was great! The concierge was very helpful and the valet staff were great."
121,1886,"Jul 21 2008 	Good hotel in central location	We booked the Omni berkshire having stayed in their Boston, Philidelphia and San francisco hotels - it was a well priced hotel for the location and standard in NYC. We had a delay in booking into one of our 2 rooms as the housekeeper was not finished and were compensated by a complimentary bottle of champagne and written apology - very much appreciated. One room at the front of the hotel (a more expensive room) was a good size for NYC the other at the rear was smaller and darker but still ok for the city. Unfortunately it was facing on to a buiiding site and noise started at 6am - the hotel offered to move the occupants but as we had only one night more to stay ithey decided not to take up the offer. We also had the larger room booked for 3 peple but discovered that there was no bed settee - they sent up a rollaway immediately. Rooms could do with refurbishment in the near future but they were clean . Nice foyer and attentive doormen!Staff were very pleasant , courteous and helpful particularly othe Irish lady on concierge duties."
122,1886,Jul 18 2008 	Excellent hotel great location loved it	I found best prices off expedia and booked two rooms for two nights. We checked in and got two adjacent rooms for us. Rooms were well setup and clean. The conceirge guided us to city tours and restaurants. No issues whatsoeverWe ordered room service and got prompt attention. Did not use the onsite restaurant as there are many choices to eat close by. Overall it was a pleasant stay for a family of 5 with two kids. The location is great (close to Madison and 52nd intersection) and we got to central park or to Times square within a few minutes by cab.I wish the hotel had it's best prices posted on it's website. You may want to check the travel sites as well.
123,1886,"Jul 17 2008 	Perfect Place to Stay in Midtown	There are not enough good things I can say about this hotel. My family and I checked in on July 4 and stayed for seven nights. The overall decor of the hotel is fresh and nicely updated. I joined Omni's Select Guest program before we traveled, and that entitled us to complimentary room service coffee or other breakfast beverages each morning, and turn down service every night, including Yohoo for the kids, as well as chocolate chip cookies and chocolates on the pillow. We also got a room upgrade to a larger room that what we would have otherwise been given. The room decor was very attractive, and the bathroom was luxuriously appointed and huge, especially for New York. The best thing the hotel has going for it, besides the price, is the location at 52nd and Madison, a block or two from Rockefeller Center, and three avenues from the theater district. The staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. The only negatives were minor--the air conditioner seemed to blow harder at times that others, requiring it to be &quot;reset&quot; by turning it off and on again. We were always plenty cool at night (we always buy a cheap fan to have in the room anyway because we're from Texas and used to the noise and air movement a fan provides). Also, there is a construction project (high rise) underway immediately adjacent to the hotel on the 53rd street side, but since we were facing the front of the hotel (52nd street), we never heard any noise from the construction. There are three sides of the hotel not facing the construction, so you simply need to request a room on one of those sides of the hotel. Finally, our room was furnished with a beautiful, oversized armoire that serves as closet, bureau, and entertainment center, but the TV that fits in the armoire is not large, so if you are going to New York City to sit in your room and watch TV, this hotel is not for you. We weren't there to watch TV, so it was never an issue. In summary, stay here."
124,1886,"Jul 6 2008 	Great Location and Great Service	Great 4th of July package. Great for a quick Yankee getaway. The service was outstanding, including select guest delivery of beverages in the am with a newspaper. Upgraded to a suite, kids loved the plasma tv in the living room area. The bathroom was large with a huge shower, all marble. The location was perfect for our activities. 1 block from St. Pats Cathedral, three blocks from Rockefeller Center. Shopping galore including the NBA store half a block away.About six blocks from subway to Yankees game, take the 4 express. When you get on at 59th street and lexington, go down to the #4 express, less stops.Burger Heaven, three of them right around the corner has great burgers and salads. Relish for the burgers is good. Quick fast service, at a NY reasonable price. Overall we were able to walk to central Park, Times Square and Central Station from our hotel. Had children age 9 and 13, no problem, actually fun to walk and people watch. Safe area with a lot of people out and about.The Omni is a quality hotel with great service."
125,1886,Jul 3 2008 	My favorite ;]	I stayed at this hotel last July while on vacation. The staff is very nice and make sure you are happy while staying there. It was not too far from Times Square or Central Park. The rooms were very nice and clean. The view from our room was amazing at night! I would stay in this hotel again anytime! :]
126,1886,"Jun 23 2008 	Incredible Service with a Smile!	This was our first stay at an Omni property and this property far exceeded our expectations. Simply, this hotel is intimate, clean and served by the best in the hospitality business. We were greeted with smiles at all times and the staff made it their business to remember guest faces, for such simple and important greetings such as &quot;welcome back&quot; when walking through the front door. Housekeeping was amazing, with the turn down service being top notch. Front desk staff was courteous and helpful. Each member of the concierge staff was more than knowledgeable about the city and its offerings. Also, the building being centrally located would be an understatement. We plan on staying at the Omni Berkshire for all future trips to NYC. This hotel is well worth the money!"
127,1886,Jun 7 2008 	Comfortable and convenient	We stayed here for a special anniversary weekend. From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful. We had asked for a quiet room for this special occasion. As it turned out this would have been overlooking a building site and we were given an upgraded room in a quieter part of the hotel. On returning from our first evening out we found chilled champagne in the room - an unexpected pleasure to start the weekend.We chose this hotel because of the convenient location and were not disappointed. A lot of the sights were within walking distance and for those that were not the subway was only a few minutes walk away.Our room was large and very comfortable. The staff were friendly and attentive. On returning from a particularly wet afternoon of sightseeing we were spied by a member of housekeeping who immediately bought extra towels to the room along with two large umbrellas for the further wet weather that was forecast.The bed being turned down each evening (and the chocolates on the pillow) along with the bowl of 'help yourself' fruit in the foyer were nice touches.We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.
128,1886,"Jun 4 2008 	Why all the fuss?	I'm not sure why this hotel generates all the overwhelmingly positive reviews it does.I arrived late at night (11pm), only to be told they couldn't find my booking - when I had the reservation and confirmation number in front of me, clear as day. Their &quot;revenue manager&quot; who would be able to dig around to find the booking was not there until the morning so until then, they made me sign a guarantee to pay their full rates &quot;just in case&quot; -- and asked me to see her the next morning. As the full rates were more than double the rate I was paying, I was a little worried and didn't sleep well.Next morning, the person I spoke to said it was &quot;all sorted out&quot;; it had been a computer problem. This was a relief, and I was told it had happened to several other people -- but I didn't appreciate having to sign that piece of paper the night before, even if it was &quot;policy&quot;.In addition, a four-minute call to upstate NY cost me almost $30. I know hotels add a surcharge, but I couldn't believe it.As for the room, it had a view of a construction site (at 11pm I was too tired to ask for another room, and I would be out all next day). The room was well sized but very dark - not much light came in at all, and the indoor lights were weak. I was squeezed in a corner next to the amenities room which was constantly opening and closing. If I were you, I would make sure I got a suitable room with a view and light. The bed was comfortable.The airy gym was very good, with free fruit, drinks, towels and shower facilities.Midtown location was excellent - just minutes away from MoMa, Rockefeller Center and major subway stops.So all in all, service wasn't very good, location was excellent, and the hotel, for what I was paying, was underwhelming."
129,1886,Jun 3 2008 	Hotel gem in Midtown Manhattan	Excellent business hotel in midtown Manhattan. Very well maintained. Reasonably priced by NYC standards. I previously stayed at the Peninsula but stopped when average room prices topped $1000 with taxes. The Omni Berkshire is slightly less luxurious (no flatscreen in the bathroom) but only slightly----and for much less.
130,1886,"Jun 3 2008 	Fantastic rooms!	After reading many reviews and talking to friends about the small room sizes in NYC for such high prices, I finally settled on the Omni after finding an excellent rate.It did not disappoint. They were in the middle of construction in their lobby so their hotel bar was closed, but otherwise, the service was professional and speedy, the concierge desk was friendly and helpful in finding us a lovely French cafe for breakfast one morning, and our room was fantastic.The room had not much of a view, but it was quiet, comfortable, and very large. The bathroom was spacious and elegant. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room was large enough for a king size bed, armoire with TV, arm chair and ottoman, small desk and chair. Off the bathroom was an entry hall with a sidetable for the stocked minibar.Would definitely stay here again if possible."
131,1886,"May 29 2008 	Nice place	We enjoyed our stay at the Omni. The hotel was clean and had nice decor and great beds. We thought the complimentary delivery of coffee and/or tea and a newspaper in the morning was a nice touch. The bellmen and doormen were exceptional; however, we found the front desk and Concierge desk to be unhelpful and a bit pretentious. Weeks prior to our arrival we started trying to arrange a car service from the hotel to the cruise ship terminal for six people and the Concierge said the best they could do was a service for $800!!!!!!!! Can you believe that? We thought it was the most ridiculous thing we had ever heard-even to the point where we asked several times because we truly thought we had misunderstood. The morning we were set to depart we happened to speak to the doorman and he arranged a private SUV service for us and we only paid $60 for 6 people, 12 pieces of luggage and a private ride to the Brooklyn Cruise terminal from the Omni!"
132,1886,"May 27 2008 	Wonderful hotel and fantastic for children	We had a fantastic stay at the Omni Berkshire. The staff were excellent and very helpful. We were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful and beautifully clean. Housekeeping were incredibly attentive. The best thing about this hotel is the attention for children. There are not many upmarket hotels in Manhattan who are kind to children. My two children, 7 and 4 were given a backpack full of fun things to do when we checked in, then of course the luxury of a suite helped enormously with the children. Also, every evening, the housekeeping staff left chocolate milk and cookies out for the children before bed. What a delightful experience and would highly recommend to families."
133,1886,"May 24 2008 	good midtown location but don't overpay	There's no question - this hotel is well situated for those who like midtown. It's also clean, safe, and the staff are reasonably attentive and friendly. However, I would not stay here again for anything close to the rack rate. We booked a special weekend deal and requested two double beds. I called twice - once two days prior and once on the day of arrival to confirm that we would receive two double beds but when we arrived we were given a king with a roll-away (at no extra cost). In addition, our room did not have &quot;soundproof&quot; windows and we did not receive a daily paper as advertised on the web site. Finally, there was no fan in the bathroom. Overall, these are relatively minor things when you receive a deeply discounted rate but I would have been annoyed if I had paid closer to the rack rate (a difference of ~$200/night). We transferred to the Omni after staying in a budget hotel closer to Union Square for the first few nights; next time I would stay in the budget hotel for the entire trip but that's just me. If you like midtown the Omni is a good choice. I know other people who've stayed there multiple times and loved it."
134,1886,"May 17 2008 	Great Value in Manhattan	I have stayed at quite a few hotels in Manhattan, and was pleasantly surprised by the Omni. It is a little less expensive than a lot of other hotels in the area--but also a whole lot nicer (anyone ever stayed at the Marriott midtown? Blech!) I have a hard time believing anyone found the staff to be rude. Every single person, from the desk clerk to the concierge to the doormen, was exceptionally nice for a hotel. I don't think my waiter at breakfast spoke much English and he was kind of quiet, but he was not rude or unpleasant, so that was fine with me. I'm not a morning person anyways, and even I was, I don't need someone with their lips on my butt that early in the morning. Or ever, actually. In fact, the staff was so nice that I wrote a positive review for their corporate affiliate and got a personal call from the Manager, who was a really nice guy.Additionally, the whole hotel was tastefully decorated,and spotlessly clean. I think it has recently been renovated, because everything in the rooms was pretty much new (the bathrooms especially had to be new--and were very nice). There were three of us in various hotel rooms on different floors. I requested a high floor and was on 15 facing Madison ave (I think), and somehow got a significantly larger room than my friends--there was a couch, a desk, an armchair and a kingsized bed, with plenty of room to navigate around everything. We actually did not need that much space (what, am I going to sit in my hotel room all day like a sloth? I don't think so), but it was nice. Our friends were on 7, and their room was probably half the size, so yeah, it was a little small, but the furniture and decoration was exactly the same quality, and the bathroom was the same size, just turned 180. They did say construction started at 8am, but they weren't really bothered by it. My other friend was on 10, and her room was also smaller, but again, same quality, same furniture, same bathroom (right down to the fixtures). All of us thought our rooms were comfortable and surprisingly nice. I guess my only complaint would be that there were a little dim (no overhead lights). It was a little hard to put on makeup in the bathroom, as someone else here mentioned. But not that big of a deal.Finally, great location. It was a 10-15 minute walk to Central Park, shopping, restaurants, etc. I would definitely recommend staying here for business or tourism (not a honeymoon spot or for kids), and I would go back. It's a great location and nice space without paying Four Season-level prices."
135,1886,"May 6 2008 	Good for business	My husband was staying at the Omni for business, and I joined him on part of the trip. I have to say that I'm used to the Four Seasons, so I'll try to judge the Omni NOT based on that standard, as the Omni is a 4-star. I think this is a great hotel for business travellers. We had a suite and it was very large. Great location, perfect for shopping! For a 4-star, the hotel seemed very nice. There were a few glitches-a dirty glass, amenities not replaced by housekeeping, etc. And the lighting was so dim it was difficult to put on my makeup in the bathroom. But other than those things, very clean and an excellent location."
136,1886,"Apr 20 2008 	Great location	Having previously stayed at the Sofitel and the Westin Times Square (where we were upgraded to a top floor room) I was expecting to be a little disappointed by the Omni Berkshire but I was pleasantly surprised. Being on the corner of E52nd and Madison you are ideally in the middle between Times Square and Central Park. My room was at the end of a corridor and overlooked Madison so I had none of the building work noise that others have mentioned. The room was of an excellent size for NYC standards (full desk, settee and easy chair and footstool all easily accommodated) and the bathroom perfectly sufficient. Overall the hotel seemed very clean. The turn down service was a nice touch. My only negative comments are: (i) the TV reception was very poor and (ii) the lighting - it was dull in the room with only table lamps to illuminate it and even in daylight it could be gloomy. The corridors, too, were oddly lit and gave the feeling the place was a bit run down, when in reality it was fine. Those however are small gripes - 150 per night for a room of that size and quality in NYC is brilliant value (and I suspect I could have got it cheaper if I had tried a bit harder). If you can't afford the Sofitel but want somewhere that is close to, but not on top of, the bright lights then I highly recommend this hotel."
137,1886,"Apr 18 2008 	OK not great	While the Omni is an OK hotel, I really don't understand the wildly enthusiastic reviews. Our room was tiny, period. A person working at the desk had to get up and move out of the way for the other person to get qround the bed. The bathroom was tiny as well - barely enough room for one person's toiletries on the sink. The armoire - there wasn't a closet - was beat up, the TV was 1980s vintage, and the hotel overall was just a tiny bit shabby . In addition, there's an office building under construction behind the hotel and if you're unlucky enough to get a room on that side be prepared for construction noise from 7AM until 5PM during the week and from 9AM until 4PM on weekends. Noise from the hallway is intrusive, too. If you like taking a nap in the afternoon - like I do - too bad. The front desk was flat out rude when we asked for another room. While the food was good in the hotel restaurant, it's wildly expensive and one of the guys who waited on us was apparently operating on another planet. He took my wife's order, I said, &quot;I'll have exactly what she's having&quot;, and he brought us two completely different meals. Later heard him complaining to a co-worker about how he was mad becauase they made him work on Sunday. Concierge was generally pleasant, but appeared overworked and a bit harried. Bell staff were definitely harried and at times non-existent. On the plus side, the hotel is in the perfect spot for convenient touring and shopping. If you can overlook its minor annoyances it's an OK, but not great, place to stay in New york."
138,1886,"Apr 15 2008 	Great Stay at the Omni	I stayed at the Omni for a girl's weekend. The room was plenty big, especially by NYC standards, for three people. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is great for anyone looking to shop along Madison Ave or 5th Ave. Cabs are aplenty and the subway is also nearby. We walked into Times Square and to Central Park. My only complaint is that the hotel is a little on the noisy side. We could hear the people in the room next to us and people in the hall. A little soundproofing would go a long way."
139,1886,"Apr 6 2008	excelent choice	Very good location, very nice and large room and bathroom, only with shower!, comfortable bed and charming personnel. The only drawbacks: a bit noisy, windows not modern enough, and a good but choices-limited breakfast buffet. (in fact we would recomend trying the Isadoras restaurant just in front of the hotel for breakfast)On the overal a hotel I would recomend if it is in budget."
140,1886,"Apr 4 2008	Little Gem - Great Service and Location	I have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Omni Berkshire. We were a party of 5 - 2 families. We had done our research, we wanted a quiet, very comfortable, well located hotel and that is exactly what we got, and a lot more...We had done our research and had checked out as many hotels and reviews as we could (including trip advisor), even trawling through the streets on google maps to get a sense of the many hotels we had reviewed. What we were looking for:mid-town manhattan locationComfortable, clean, well designed roomsGood polite serviceWithin walking distance of amenitiesQuietnessIn our research, the Omni Berkshire seemed to have all these qualities and we were not dissapointed. It was busy when we got there. However, the service was really good. There was a lovely atmosphere and staff were helpful and friendly. I was worried that the atmosphere might be stiff, but no it was absolutely lovely - helpful but not in your face. We were very happy. We were upgraded to larger rooms and the views from one were amazing (top floor suite). The concierge were just great, particularily mary.Looks like we have found a gem that we would be very happy to return to. This hotel is great for singles, families, groups, business."
141,1886,"Apr 1 2008 	good choice	The hotel is beautifully maintained and staff are helpful and polite. The beds are comfortable, and the temperature control is perfect. However, the rooms are exceptionally small. Please also note there is a long-term construction project going on next door, with jack hammers beginning at 7 AM."
142,1886,"Mar 28 2008 	Great for business	I stayed at this hotel for a business trip and it was perfect. The staff are friendly and efficient, the bed was comfortable, the toiletries were nice, and the concierge gives great restaurant recommendations.I didn't have the breakfast because it seemed very expensive, but there's a cafe directly across the street which does delicious omlettes, bagels, etc.The location is right in the centre of midtown - near to MOMA, shopping, central park - you can walk everywhere. Just make sure you explore the rest of New York - it'd be tempting just to stay in this area."
143,1886,"Mar 20 2008 	Nice stay at Omni	My two daughters and I stayed the weekend of 3/14/08. I enjoyed the location of the hotel and the comfortable bed. The problem I had was that I had requested a high floor for a more quiet room and I had called twice to tell the staff it was a birthday celebration. None of my requests were met nor any special consideration for the birthday. I have contacted the manager and have been assured in the future this will not occur again. The hotel was full, probably because of St. Patricks day. The staff had little interaction with us other than to offer a king room or Jr. suite with fold out couch. Not good options for three people. The hotel was lovely and morning coffee service was great. If you have a special request be sure you contact the manager and not just the front desk. Overall nice trip."
144,1886,"Mar 19 2008 	Have Always Enjoyed My Stays at the Omni	We've stayed at the Omni a number of times for the last 7 years and have always been pleased. The rooms are nice, the location is great and I have always found the staff to be very accomodating."
145,1886,"Mar 15 2008 	Loved the Omni	I stayed here in 05 with a girlfriend on a weekend theater trip. This hotel is nice and comfortable. It is clean and in a great location to shopping, museums, and theaters. The staff was friendly. The room was spacious. The bed was plush and cozy. They will store your bags before and after check in so you don't have to plan your trip around the hotel's check in and out times."
146,1886,"Mar 10 2008 	Great Weekend at the Omni	Went for a girls weekend and loved everything about the Omni. The room's (830 and 832) were a decent size for 3 adults per room - large for NYC standards. Check in was great, we arrived at 1pm and our rooms were ready. We had signed up for an omni membership prior to traveling and as a result got 1 free hot beverage and 1 free cold beverage delivered to the room each morning. Concierge staff and bell hops both could not do enough for us they were so helpful. Bathrooms had nice amenities, plush robes and all the tolietries one expects at a decent 4* hotel. There is some light construction going on at the office block right across the street from the hotel but it didn't start until about 8am, by which time we were up and about. Easy walk also from many of the major attractions (St Patricks Cathedral, Rockerfeller Center etc)........not to talk about all of the shops. There is a Duane Reed drug store 1 block over where you can buy your water and soft drinks so that you don't get gouged by minibar prices. I would stay here again on a trip to NYC."
147,1886,"Mar 9 2008 	good not great	This hotel is nice but not luxury. The room was not very large but the bathroom was nice and a good size. For some reason, the maid sprayed something that smelled like Febreeze all over the room and the smell really bothered me. I would stay here again only if I couldn't find another hotel I liked better for the same price."
148,1886,"Mar 5 2008	Wonderful Experience	My friend and I stayed with our teenage girls at the Omni for a double Sweet Sixteen weekend celebration in February. It was a fantastic experience and we loved the Omni. I have always stayed in hotels in Times Square before (Marquis, Renaissance, Westin) and I love being in the hustle and bustle. However, I found that retreating here at the Omni was a welcomed change at the end of each of our very long days out. We weren't in the room very long because we were up and out very early in the morning, back for a quick change before our evening plans and then right to bed after the Broadway show each evening. When we checked in, we were put in room 1616 which was an incredible coincidence since we were there to celebrate both our girls' 16th birthdays! I asked if they did that on purpose and they said &quot;no&quot;! Just weird and kinda cool for our girls! The room was an OK size, not huge. It was a double/double but the 4 of us did fine there and had room for our suitcases. It was just adequate space but nice. The bathroom was very pretty as shown in some of the traveller photos here. They sent up complimentary cookies and YooHoo's each day. I guess this was their way of treating our birthday girl's special. It was a nice guesture. We also received free beverages for 2 of our 3 mornings. Not sure if this was due to my friend booking with the Travelzoo rate or because of the birthday girls. There was no coffee maker in the room but there were umbrellas. Of course there is a Starbucks on every corner in NYC and we did get the free coffee each morning from Room Service. The check in, bell staff and conceirge were wonderful and everyone was so very nice. The room was pretty quiet too considering it is NYC! Just the occasional horns honking down below but no construction noise and no elevator noise considering the elevators were right outside our room door. My only negative is that it is hard for 2 people to sleep comfortably in a double bed. Queen beds would've made it much easier. We aren't big people but I thought I might fall off the bed trying to stay on my side of the double! This hotel is in a very nice, safe location very close to some wonderful shopping. We always felt safe as we walked home. Everything is within quick walking distance...Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and the Subway stations are right around the corner. We loved the Omni and would consider it again when we are looking for the best accomodations for a reasonable price."
149,1886,"Mar 3 2008 	Wonderful Experience - Excellent Customer Service	Stayed for one night this past weekend and got a terrific rate through an online newsletter. In spite of the rate, we were treated like honored guests and upgraded to an incredibly large room since the check-in folks noted that we were travelling with two kids. Requests for foam pillows and a rolloway were answered promptly and my children loved the kids &quot;welcome pack&quot; at check-in. Truly superior service all around from valet parking to baggage check to front desk. Loved the hotel and location and will definitely stay again."
150,1886,Feb 29 2008 	Enjoyed the expereince	I am a frequent traveller with the Omni chain. The service was excellent and room very confortable. The proximty to everything in Manhattan could not be beaten.
151,1886,"Feb 28 2008 	Great location!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni 2/21  2/24 (Thursday  Sunday). I found a great rate of $219/night  probably due to it being off-season. Im an Omni Select Guest member and we were upgraded to a deluxe King room. I requested to be away from construction as I had read of some complaints. We were right on 52nd street and didnt hear a bit of construction. The room was quite large for NYC and had a sitting area with loveseat. The bathroom was clean and included a shower/bathtub combo. The TV is a bit small, but when in NYC, who watches a bunch of TV? As an Omni Select Guest, you get a free newspaper and 2 free beverages in the morning (you can pick what time they bring it). I thought this was a very nice touch and they were right on time with our coffee and juice each morning. There is an umbrella in the room, which came in handy on our trip. My only minor complaint about the room would be the towels and bathrobes seemed a bit dingy for a 4 star hotel, but really not that big of a deal. Turn-down service is offered nightly.The location is great, just a block off of 5th Ave. There is a subway station very close at 53rd and 5th Ave. that has the E line. There is also a close subway station at 51st and Lexington that has the 6 line. Since the weather was very cold on our trip (the biggest snow storm in 2 years!), we decided to cab it to Broadway shows at night. I think this could be walkable in better weather. However, there were often not cabs available and we often took the town cars that wait outside the hotel (for probably double the rate). This is probably not the hotels fault, but I wondered if there is some deal with the town cars and the hotel. Or maybe it was just the bad weather causing a lack of cabs.We were able to check in right away (even though we arrived at 11am) and also were granted late check out on our last day. We didnt eat at the hotel, but the Fireside restaurant looked nice. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if I found a good rate. Any questions, feel free to PM me."
152,1886,"Feb 27 2008 	Brilliant Hotel	We stayed in the Omni for our honeymoon late last year. We had come from Aruba and didnt arrive until after 9pm, wrecked. The location of this hotel cannot be beaten in my opinion. St Patricks Cathedral is literally around the corner. Our room was good, small enough but what we expected in New York. It was very clean, the bathroom was nice, not noisy, very nice hotel staff  especially the concierge. I would recommend Smith &amp; Wollensky for steaks  you can only get 16oz steaks which I wouldnt eat so rather than waste food I ordered the lemon chicken  which I was told was a WHOLE chicken!! So go here hungry  great steaks and well worth a visit. BICE Italian was recommended by the concierge and we loved it  really great staff, food, wine and general atmosphere. We also ate in Waters Edge. This was nice  very expensive and the yacht was broken the night we went. They were under pressure because of the yacht being broken so I dont think we saw it at its best. Still it was nice. We did A LOT of shopping  our favourite was Bloomingdales. Macys was too crowded and Bergdorf Goodman too expensive. Dont forget to avail of the 11% discount for visitors in Bloomingdales &amp; Macys. We went to the Guggenheim museum  worth a visit and hired bikes in Central Park which was brilliant. Pershing Square Diner beside Grand Central Station is somewhere we went for breakfast  highly recommend it. We will definitely be going back to New York and we will definitely stay in the Omni. Oh and its well worth joining the Select Guest programme  free coffee &amp; juice every morning."
153,1886,"Feb 21 2008	Location is about all you get	My family of 6 stayed at the Omni this past weekend (Feb 15-18) and we were disappointed. First, you should know that there is construction going on right next to the hotel. We could look out our window and practically touch the construction site. We did not have noise to deal with because of the holiday weekend, but another traveler might. Also, I had booked two rooms and paid extra for King Deluxe with two beds in each room. I also phoned the hotel to reiterate this necessity and to request adjoining rooms. My children are 10 and under, so we needed them to be in an adjoining room. When we arrived, we were told that not only did they not have any rooms with two beds, but that we also could not get adjoining rooms. They offered us a cot for free in each room - but still - I had paid about $100 extra for the two beds! Running bak and forth to two rooms proved to be a royal pain.The first night, I asked the concierge for directions to a Japanese noodle restaurant and she sent us to a different one than I had requested. Maybe she got a kickback - I don't know. The rooms are decent but the TV is TINY and as soon as you walk in, ther is a console stuffed with minibar food on the top -- I should have asked the hotel to remove the mini bar food! Also, when we left, it took over 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car. I think they didn't actually order it until we asked the second time after having waited 30 minutes already.The doorman was a pleasure and it was nice to have the hotels umbrellas (which were in our closet) on the day it rained. The location is great - but that is about all the good I can say."
154,1886,"Feb 16 2008 	Above and Beyond!!	I travel to NYC 4-6 times a year for business and have stayed at more than 25 different hotels here over the last 10 years. The Omni Berkshire has always been at the top of my list, but my most recent stay here cemented it as an all-time favorite. Sure, the rooms here are very nice and clean. Comfortable beds, nice bathrooms, etc. Slightly better than other 4 star properties in mid-town. The lobby is pretty, restaurant is good and room service offers some ver y selections. But, what sets this hotel apart from all others is the service! REAL service that actually feels like you have friends and family at the front desk and with the concierge. It is sincere and genuine. During my recent stay, I became very ill with a horrible stomach flu. I've never been so sick. And, nothing is as bad as being very sick while on a business trip. The on-duty concierge, Beatrice, not only found a doctor and arranged an in-room appointment for me, she called several times to check on me and even insisted that I drink some gatorade to stay hydrated. She actually went to the store, bought me gatorade and personally brought it to my room! Beatrice was sincerely concerned about me and treated me as if I was a personal friend (or family member). It was almost like having my own mother here to take care of me. WOW! I've stayed in a lot of hotels, in a lot of places, and never experienced service like this... even at hotels that charge 5X as much. Thank you, Omni! Thank you, Beatrice. I will always return to this wonderful hotel with the most incredible staff in NYC!"
155,1886,"Feb 9 2008 	This place rocks!	I stayed here last summer with 2 friends, and this place was awesome! We were upgraded to a suite upon arrival (yeah!) and the room was incredible. The staff was beyond polite and helpful, the doorman was excellent at getting our cabs, and the location was wonderful. The beds were very comfortable (even the sofa bed where I slept), and the attention to detail by housekeeping was much appreciated.We didn't know much about the layout of NYC before we arrived, and we spent the first day and a half very near our hotel. On the 2nd night when we ventured into the Times Square area, I was very happy with our choice of hotel :)If I ever have the pleasure of visiting New York City again, I will absolutely stay here again. We felt like royalty."
156,1886,"Feb 6 2008	It Took 25 Years to Find the Perfect NY Hotel!!	I travel to NY 2-4 times a year and have stayed at so many hotels over the last 20 years. In every other city that I travel to I have found a hotel that I love and return to over and over again. NY has been harder, Staying in Times Square is the best location for me so I have stayed at The Westin, W, The Millennium and The Marriott many times. For one reason or another I've never &quot;loved&quot; any of them. Every once in a while I'll pick another spot to try and again just never found any of the hotels particularly wonderful on enough points to return. I'm so excited that I finally found the perfect hotel for my needs. Why?1) Conflict Resolution: I had a few relatively minor issues when I checked in. The next morning I spoke with a Manager, I believe her name was Bernadette, and she went way above and beyond to respond to my complaint. Grade A+2) The room was a reasonable size for NY standards with a wonderful bed, sheets, bathroom, shower (good water pressure is a must) &amp; towels. Grade B+3) Room service was prompt, the staff incredibly friendly &amp; courteous. The food (omlette &amp; fries) was excellent &amp; Starbucks coffee in the AM. Yes, the menu is pricey but very comparable to other NY hotels and with far superior food. Grade B+4) Amenities: Complimentary Wireless Internet and coffee in the AM are simple touches that really make a big difference! Grade A+5) Excellent Neighborhood! There's a burger place across the street that had fabulous burgers and onion rings - really, really great! Grade A6) Service: Everyone that I encountered was outstanding! Grade A+The only negative for me was a pretty old TV with a small choice of stations. Seems like a small thing &amp; maybe it is for most people but for me a night without MSNBC (Chris, Keith &amp; Dan) is like starting the day without coffee. Grade on TV - C-"
157,1886,"Feb 5 2008	Excellent Choice for Theater Weekend	We were part of a family group of three couples who stayed at the Omni in the beginning of January for a theater weekend. We booked broadway tickets through a special we saw on travelzoo and then used their site to search for hotels. The Omni was very reasonable so we used the travelzoo discount code and booked online at the Omni's site. We are very pleased we stayed there. The room was spacious, bathroom large and staff very friendly. I really liked their web check-in process. We said we'd be there at 11:30AM, showed up on time and our keys were ready on arrival. I appreciated that they treated us with great care even though we'd booked using a discount. All three couples enjoyed the hotel and agreed we'd like to stay there when we do our 2009 theater weekend."
158,1886,"Jan 24 2008 	Great location not so great service	This is my third time staying at the Omni Berkshire in the heart of Upper Mid-town Manhattan, although this is my first time staying without the family and on my own. Rate was great deal, and that was a big factor in the stay (~300/night, compared to ~500 normally) for the week before Christmas. This hotel is all about location, location, location! You are the same distance to Central Park as you are to Times Square. Right by Rockefeller Center, 1/2 block from 5th Ave, and only minutes to all the major shopping up north off Madison Ave. For those looking for an amazing experience within the hotel, the Omni will not amaze. The rooms are overpriced relative to size, even for Manhattan and the noise level from outside is disturbing at almost every location throughout the hotel; whether the noise is coming from outside or the floors above/below, the Omni just happens to be of an older construction with thinner walls and windows than one would expect from a 4-diamond ranked Hotel. As long as the price is right, it's not that bad of a hotel, but sells itself as a luxury-minded, high-end hotel; however this claim is only holds true on the surface."
159,1886,"Jan 5 2008 	Pleasantly surprised at the Omni	My husband, 12-year old son and I just returned from a trip to NYC where we stayed at the Omni Berkshire for two nights. I learned about a special rate being offered at the hotel via Travel Zoo. At $209/night (plus taxes), we were a bit concerned about what we'd end up with, but the hotel was lovely, staff very friendly and efficient and the room exceeded our expectations. The room was a suite, probably 500 square feet, with separate rooms for our king size bed and the sitting/living room area with pull out couch. Each room had its own T.V. -- a real perk for my son. Because they knew we were visiting with a child, they delivered complimentary Yoo-Hoo and cookies to our room each evening. The location at 52nd &amp; Madison was an easy walking distance to the attractions at Times Square &amp; Rockefeller Center, theaters and shopping -- without being in the middle of the hustle bustle. We bought a three-attraction pass at Rockefeller Center that included admission to the Top of the Rock - where we were fortunate to enjoy an exceptionally clear night's view of the entire NYC area, an NBC Studio Tour, and a Stage Door Tour of Radio City Music Hall - well worth it if you've ever been there for a show (or not) but never had the opportunity to appreciate it's history and splendor without the thousands of show-goers.I would comfortably recommend the Omni Berkshire."
160,1886,"Jan 2 2008 	Fantastic Hotel in Midtown Manhattan	We wanted to stay in New York for some shopping and we stayed at this hotel just after Christmas because of a deal we found on one of the travel website.Due to its excellent location (next to Fifth Ave, one block from St Patrick's Cathedral and two blocks from Rockefeller center) a room normally should cost more than $500 (including taxes) per night. With the deal, we paid less than $300 (including taxes).We love the cleaness of the room, high class furniture, friendly and very helpful workers (especially the doorman).Be sure to join their frequent program, then you can get a couple of free drinks per guest every morning, delivered to the room. In addiiton to free wireless internet.Considering the location and unmatched services, it just worth every dime."
161,1886,"Dec 6 2007 	Ok	We went and stayed at the Omni with our 2 children in the Berkshire suit. The suit was very nice and clean but small and not really big enough to pull out the sofa . I felt for almost 1,000 a night with taxes it should of been bigger.Also we stayed in Room 819 and I could hear every night some people talking above my room. It was very annoying. I didn't report the problem because Im sure they couldn't of done anything about t. Its not like the guest were loud they were just talking. But you could hear them.The front desk was ok to us , and the women at the concierge was just ok also. The city was full and we couldn't find any cabs on saturday night . We ate in the resturant at the hotel which was very good, but Exteremely expensive. Especially breakfast like 23 for Eggs toast and homefries. NYC pricesOverall the Omni was good but we have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria and enjoyed that hotel more."
162,1886,Dec 1 2007 	Lovely clean calm	Stayed on a busy Saturday night in November. Hotel was fully booked. Room was ready at noon when we checked in. Hotel parking greeters were welcoming and upbeat. Our 7th floor room looked out on Madison Ave and a fun street fair. Room was immaculate and pleasantly sized.The location is out of the Times Square craziness yet convenient to everything. Just a short walk to Bloomingdales!
163,1886,"Dec 1 2007 	Fantastic stay	Stayed at the Omni for the US OPEN tennis tournament. Very comfortable, spacious rooms (for NYC) excellent service,location etc. Clean, comfortable beds. Would recommend and stay there again for sure!"
164,1886,"Nov 30 2007 	Perfect spot for the holidays	My Family and I stayed at the Omni Berkshire for 4 nights over the Thanksgiving weekend. This is an excellent hotel in an ideal location. You are a 5 minute or less walk from everything (Rockefeller Center, Times square, Fifth Avenue shops and Central park.) The hotel itself is very nice and for a fairly large hotel has a boutique feel to it. We had a standard King room which was more than nicely firnished and had a suprisingly large bathroom. The hotel staff was also very nice and we never had a problem getting our car out of the valet. Finally we booked the hotel on hotels.com for under $300 a night which was at least a $150 less than any other 4 or 5 star hotel in the city. so it was also a great value."
165,1886,"Nov 30 2007 	The perfect stay!	From the wonderful service we received from Eduardo at the Front Desk upon arrival to the moment we left, we loved our stay at The Omni!The room was lovely and we were most impressed by the bathroom. Houskeeping had done a fabulous job and everything was immaculate. Amenities left nothing to be desired and the location was A#1.I've found a new home in New York. Thank you, Omni Berkshire for a memorable weekend stay."
166,1886,"Nov 25 2007	Quiet comfortable hotel	My family of four stayed here for the weekend. The doormen /bellmen were extremely friendly and my children actually looked for them every day when we went out because they enjoyed talking to them. The hotel is nice and quiet, not what you would think of staying in NY. The only negative I have was.... the Concierge from &quot;Ireland&quot;, she seemed to recommend her &quot;friends&quot; places of establishments and bad mouthed anything else. Not what I would expect from a Concierge, it was SO obvious!! I would stay here again because it was nice coming back from a day of shopping to peace and quiet. Also great location, withing walking distance to nearly everything."
167,1886,"Nov 24 2007	First Trip To NY From Houston Texas	I can not stress how impressed we were with the Omni, the staff and the location! The service was impeccable! If you are going to NY for the first time STAY AT THE OMNI!!!!"
168,1886,Nov 12 2007 	Great stay courteous staff	We are a family of 4 and we arrived at 2am because of our flight delay. Had to book a Madison suite as I waited too long to get a Berkshire suite. Great room. Wonderful staff at the front desk while checking in. They suggested we get a roll away as we have 2 daughters. They brought it promptly up to our room. Have to agree with a previous post that getting a taxi at the hotel is hard especially around 6-8pm. A couple evenings we just used a private car that happened upon the hotel (I know they must sit around there knowing the taxi situation). One evening we shared an SUV with a couple and split the cost which worked out fine as they were going in the Broadway area too and it was raining. Loved the location as its easy to walk around to eat and shop and sightsee. Only minor problem we had is when we were checking out and wanting to leave our bags at the hotel since our fight wasn't until 8pm. We called and no one came for 30 minutes. My husband finally decided to call again and they had never received a message to come up. They promptly came up within a couple minutes. We would stay at the Omni again for sure.
169,1886,"Nov 10 2007 	The good and the Bad	My family and I stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place in early November. Let's start with the good--it has a great location (52nd and Madison) and the room was lovely-very spacious, nice bathroom and a nice flat screen tv. Now to the bad. The person checking us in was UNBELIEVABLY rude. Now I have stayed at MANY properties in NYC, so I am well versed on the &quot;city attitude.&quot; This was WAY beyond. We were greeted by the front desk woman on duty with an icy stare and &quot;NEXT.&quot; No welcome, no nothing. When I told her we were checking in all she said was &quot;NAME&quot; --didn't even look at me. This was at about 8:30 on Friday night and we were the only people checking in, so it wasn't like she was swamped. When I asked whether my Omni Select number was included in my reservation, she rudely barked &quot;I'm getting to that.&quot; This is what you get for spending more than $800 a night at a hotel that rates itself as 5 star?!?! We SERIOUSLY considered changing hotels, and our &quot;greeting&quot; colored our entire visit. The rest of the staff ignored us throughout the visit unless we directly asked them something (ie can you get us a cab?) But at least they weren't outwardly rude. I have had great experiences with the staff at the Four Seasons, the Ritz Carlton and the Iroquois, and from now on I will give my business to them. When you stay at an expensive hotel, you want to be treated well and with respect. Doesn't the hotel guest deserve that?"
170,1886,"Oct 31 2007 	Great time at the Omni	Stayed here 10/26-10/28 room 1710. I really loved this hotel. Great location for everything midtown and close to subway stops. I arrived at 1:00 and was given an early checkin and a free room upgrade. I got a king bed, very comfy. The room was large with a sitting chair, desk and armoire. Came with extra pillows and an umbrella (came in very handy since it rained all weekend). The bathroom was an ok size, and was great for me with just 1 traveler, but would work for 2. Housekeeping was very nice and the room was nicely cleaned each day. There are in room hair dryers, safes, and robes. My hair dryer didn't work. Called housekeeping and it was replaced within 10 minutes. I'm not sure about the reviews stating there was bad noise. My room was right by the elevators and I rarely heard anyone, except for Sunday morning hallway traffic. Ate/drank one night at the Fireside. Nice bar, good food and the bartenders were great. It was a fantastic stay! I would definitely recommend and would stay there again."
171,1886,"Oct 20 2007	Very good stay with one problem	I stayed at the Omni for the first time for four nights in mid-October. Overall the stay was excellent. The hotel is in a prime location, the room was large (by NY standards) and well appointed. Service was very good and always professional. The fitness room was small but the equipment was in good condition.A few tips:i) Sign up for the Select Guest program - it is free and you get free wireless internet (otherwise $9.95/day) and free coffee delivered to your room in the morning.ii) There is construction going on in an adjacent lot. Request a room facing 52nd street and the construction noise won't bother you.iii) I stayed in a superior room - my associate stayed in a deluxe room (deluxe is lowest class, superior is next step up). There is a big difference in room size, location, etc. Pay the extra money and get the superior room.iv) For some reason, catching a cab outside the hotel was nearly impossible. The only time we could get a cab was when someone else was dropping off at the hotel. Don't waste your time waiting out front of the hotel - walk over to Madison and catch a cab there (or walk to Lexington and take the subway!).There was only one legitimate negative about my stay at the Omni - and the reason why I only rated it Above Average and not Excellent. There is a tremendous amount of room noise. I am fully used to and accept street noise as a given in NY and even a little bit of hallway noise with people constantly coming and going. My problem was the extreme amount of noise coming from adjacent rooms. Whether this was because of thin walls, poor insulation, or some other reason I don't know. However, I was able to clearly hear conversations in adjacent rooms and hear the person staying above me walk across his floor (my ceiling). It got so bad one night around 10pm (when I desperately needed to get to sleep) that I had to call security and ask them to go to the room next door and ask those guests to be quiet. Security came proptly, the person was very professional, and the people next door were justifiably dumbfounded that their basically normal conversation was disturbing other guests (I know all of this because I could hear the entire conversation in my room). I found this whole situation to be very bizarre. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in NY and usually they're in old buildings with walls build very thickly or in newer buildings where walls have been well insulated. This is the first time I've experienced something like this. I don't know if this was something specific to my room (722), my floor, or an overall problem in the hotel. I see that management responds to the comments on this site so maybe they can address this?I found this noise problem to be very annoying, but I would give the Omni another try given all of the other positives I listed above."
172,1886,"Oct 8 2007 	A Great Value	Just finshed my fourth stay at the Berkshire Place and thought it was time to put something in writing. There certainly are fancier hotels, but the Berkshire Place has become a reliable old friend in New York. Spacious and clean rooms, courteous people, and services that you would expect from more expensive hotels (constant maid service, shoe-shines, great concierge personnel, high-quality mini-bar items), a fantastic location, and consistency of service keep me coming back. Don't get me wrong--there' s not much &quot;wow&quot; factor here (it's not the St. Regis), but this is a great hotel. I'll be back. Kudos to Omni Hotels and the Berkshire Place staff."
173,1886,"Oct 5 2007 	Great hotel but lost one bag.	My wife and I stayed at the Omni on a recent visit to Manhattan. The accommodations were great, and the staff was polite. One thing that put a damper on things was that at check-in, one of our bags was not delivered to the room, instead it was - inexplicably - thrown away. We had phone chargers and head sets in it, and so couldn't use our phones over the weekends. Every day we were promised that &quot;they're looking for the bag&quot; and that if they cant find it by end of the day, they'll &quot;make it right.&quot; this promise was repeated every day, by a new manager on duty, well after the weekend. We wound up retelling the story nearly a dozen times, wasting a couple hours over the course of the weekend. Once we left, we were told that they'll purchase and send us replacements - didn't happen. We were then assured that if we buy them ourselves, we will be reimbursed. Again, didn't happen right away, and we weren't fully reimbursed until once again asking what's going on.the hotel is in a great location, the room was nice and spacious and clean, but them losing our bag, and doing a poor job &quot;making it right,&quot; definitely soured things a bit."
174,1886,"Oct 1 2007 	Wonderful hotel	We were originally booked at another hotel that was awful so we found this hotel. It was perfect. The hotel was clean, rooms and bathrooms were large. I was shocked at how big the room was for NYC. The location was excellent as well. We were able to walk to many of the sights or get on the train very easily. I hope to return to this hotel sometime soon!"
175,1886,"Oct 1 2007	Good Hotel	I stayed here for work and chose it for its good location to our offices. The hotel is a bit non-descript and thought the cabbie was pulling into the wrong location when I realized it was a hotel. The lobby looks very old, not in a bad way but also not in an elegant way either. It is very small and fairly ordinary.The elevators are pretty ancient as well, however the rooms are really nice. Mine was large, very modern and nicely decorated in nice neutral muted tones. The bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet at night. In the morning it got loud enough to interfere with sleep but the annoying rattling from the fan did.Room service is very fast and has great food. The mashed potatoes are really fantastic."
176,1886,"Oct 1 2007 	A surprise!	My wife and I often stay in midtown New York, and we know the hotels will be expensive, small and generally have a curt staff. The Berkshire was quite a surprise. The room was large using New York standards with many nice services. It was designed for the traveler in mind and had a certain warmth about it. Outlets were available and the desk area well done. The bath was complete and obviously of high quality. Of course, the window view was of roof tops but it was still quiet. The staff could not have been more accommodating. From the front desk, doormen, the concierge, to the room service personnel...all were well trained and anticipated our needs in a friendly manner. Never felt rushed. They treated my wife with much respect and helpfulness. Service with a smile. For example, on the way in my shirt has an encounter with Starbucks coffee, and I exhibited shades of brown hues. Although the laundry was closed, the staff figured it out quickly and delivered a finely laundered shirt in no time. Cudos! I think I have found a good place to stay on my next visit."
177,1886,"Sep 9 2007	nice relaxing	The Omni was a great, relaxing hotel. Nice lobby, very helpful front desk staff (Maria is the best), good gym, nice array of toiletries and extra like chocolate on your bed and the ice cooler already filled to the brim :). The rooms and bathrooms were spacious for a NY hotel - I stayed in both a king and 2 doubles, and the room with 2 doubles was slightly bigger. Also, of course the location is great - a few short blocks from St. Pats and Rockefeller Center. The only things I had issues with were the so-called business amenities. Wireless is not free, but you can sign up to their select program, which is free, to get free wireless as a perk. Very complicated! The prices at their business center for printing and faxing were also ridiculous. Other negatives: No continental breakfast, no coffee maker in the room, and no complimentary lounge area with snacks or drinks. Overall, just your typical upscale NYC hotel - nothing special, but you can't go wrong staying here."
178,1886,"Sep 7 2007 	Great Hotel	The Berkshire is well located for seeing the sites of NYC and for shopping. It is located in a side street between the fashionable Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue. Central Park and St Patrick's cathedral are a short walk away. On arrival we were upgraded to a well equipped 'Executive' room with plenty of space and complimentary morning beverages. However they can't guarantee an extra bed for three people when the hotel is very full so that could be a problem if they are out of rooms with two doubles and only have King rooms left. We we were there during Labour Day weekend and the US open tennis tournament was on so the hotel was fully booked - probably indicates how popular the hotel is. Most of the hotels on Manhattan get fully booked on this Saturday night and prices rise accordingly! We met a retired American multi-millionaire in the bar area who preferred this hotel when visiting New York to other more glitzy and expensive hotels. The must see Museum of Modern Art is close by and if time permits the Metropolitan Museum of Art is also not to be missed. The staff are very professional and the concierge very helpful. We ate in the Fireside restaurant one night which serves good food in a recently refurbished area. If you prefer someting cheaper in the morning then there is a Smilers self service food outlet one block away, and for the evening classy steak houses are nearby. One of the best hotels we have stayed in so no hesitation recommending the Berkshire."
179,1886,"Sep 6 2007	Mixed Reveiw	My girlfriend and I arrived at the Omni on Thursday, August 30 for 5 days and thoroughly excited about being in NY for the first time. When we booked the hotel through Expedia we requested a room with double beds and followed through with a phone call to the Reservation desk at the Omni a week prior to arrival. Unfortunately, neither request was fulfilled and the front desk could do nothing to accommodate us  so we ended up sharing a bed. Upon speaking with the manager, a promise of some sort of amenity was given but the offer was never fulfilled. It was a very frustrating experience and makes one wonder if you book through a travel venue such as Expedia if requests are given second priority? The hotel itself was lovely although we could hear everything in the rooms next to us - including conversations of the occupants."
180,1886,"Aug 25 2007 	5-star stay!	Everything about this stay was above and beyond our expectations. Great location, service, room, etc., etc. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, every member of the hotel staff was very professional and accommodating. I visit NYC a few times a year and this was my first stay at the Omni, but it will definitely not be my last!!!"
181,1886,"Aug 19 2007	Fabulous	For $224 a nigt we had a 5 star experience.I joined their omni club for free and received free internet access and beverages each morning.The room was clean and well appointed. The bathroom was roomy. I checked in online and when I got there, at 11am my room was ready and the paperwork was all done.They let us check out at 2pm.I could go on and on, but suffice to say, even at double the room rate, I would not hesitate to stay here. It was our 4th time. We have never been disappointed.It is between 5th and Madison, which is exactly where you want to be for eating, shopping and the theatre.It was just wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!"
182,1886,"Aug 3 2007	Great location nice hotel	10 of us stayed in 4 rooms July 21-23. Two of the rooms were supposed to have double beds, but upon arrival we were told the doubles were all gone and the hotel was full so we had to go with cots. That wasn't much of a problem as those rooms had kids that could sleep on the cots but for adults, the cots would be tight. Anyway, the hotel is really clean, great location and staff very helpful. The rooms are small, but bathrooms big. We are all preferred Omni people so we took advantage of the free morning drinks (nonalcoholic of course).Yes, there is construction going on next door, but we were on the 15th floor and that didn't bother us.The hotel provided fresh, free apples while we were there and that was a nice touch.The staff was very helpful in giving directions and making dinner suggestions. We did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to experience NYC.The bedding and towels were wonderful. Hotel soaps and shampoos were some of the best we've had. We would gladly stay there again!"
183,1886,"Jul 31 2007 	Excellent Hotel Choice	We stayed at the Omni Berkshire July 27-29. Excellent hotel choice. Very clean and well-maintained. Good service. Sign up for guest program to receive free morning coffee and newspaper. Convenient location. Expensive room service, but there is plenty near hotel for eating. Room w/ king bed was nice size. No construction noise as we stayed on the weekend. Highly recommend hotel!"
184,1886,"Jul 30 2007	Very disorganized	Our company booked a business meeting at the Omni in New York. The Omni is on a fantastic location in midtown manhattan. It's a boutique hotel on the upper price bracket and rated an exclusive 4 star and the room rates are quite steep. The hotel lobby is clean and pleasant. The front office staff are friendly.But the hotel is extremely poorly organized and probably the most unorganized hotel I have ever stayed at.We had booked a double room with two separate beds, to be shared by two employees. On check-in I was a bit disappointed to find that the double beds we had reserved were not available. Instead we had to get an extra bed to the room, or the only option share a single &quot;kingsize&quot; bed (!) which in actuality looked more like a single queensized bed. From then on the hotel organization only got worse: the other employee had arrived earlier but was not allowed a room key. He was left waiting for 4 hours although his name was added onto the room reservation. Needless to say he was not happy.Our preparations for the meeting started very early the following morning so we had put a notice 18 hours in advance to have breakfast served in the room since there was no time for us to have it in the restaurant. Breakfast never showed up and they had not even picked up the breakfast menu that we had to hang on the door. At the actual business center things did not get better organized. Our instructions with requirements for the meeting weeks prior seemed to have been ignored. Everything from seating numbers to arrangements had no resemblence to what had been discussed with the hotel. When we again went through the details with someone on the phone, I was given exaggerated excuses where they were defensive and put the blame on us (This offended us. All they had to do was review records of our prior communications where everything was plain and clear). We were told they could not make further changes as it was now in the last minute. We were paying several thousand dollars for hall and breaks on rates beyond the normal in other parts of the country. Finally, on our insistance, they rearranged the set-up to what we had initially requested.During our pre-preparations we ran into more problems and confusions on their arrangements; meeting timings were wrong in announcements, equipment we had rented did not show up and we got notified just minutes before the meeting. The hall space was so cramped the attendees could not walk properly in the isle to get out of the hall but had to move tables although we had been told the hall could accommodate far more people than our meeting numbers (this was not true at all). The duty staff for that day, were polite and did try their best to help and get things sorted out which was the only reason we could handle the situation without getting angry. One hotel staff who had only introduce himself to us in the morning but done no other preparations for us, had the courage to tell us in the afternoon he was 'leaving for the day' (a polite indication to give tip), but we saw him run about the hotel for another few hours after that. Needless to say, we paid a lot of money for the setup already and the hotel did a very poor job in justifying the charges. For this reason and all the last minute stress added onto us, we did not feel inspired to tip staff for meeting arrangements.I do feel the Omni is a good hotel for normal tourist stays, perhaps not to hold a meeting in. The 4 star rating and room rates seem a bit steep for what you get, but the hotel is clean, location superb, the staff in general are friendly and helpful and they do try to correct the poor management and organization the hotel seem to suffer from. If room rates were lower I would stay at the Omni again as a visitor. But holding future meetings? NO!"
185,1886,"Jul 29 2007 	Book the Berkshire	The Omni Berkshire excels because it has the three things every exceptional hotel must have: luxurious touches, a staff that is truly at the service of its guests, and a location that puts you in the heart of the action. This hotel is the best value Ive yet encountered in Manhattan. In New York, you can blow a lot of money on trendy hotels with claustrophobic rooms, or on sumptuous palaces of over-the-top comforts you really dont need. Or you can stay at the Berkshire and get a lot for your buck while feeling pampered. My wife, daughter and I were upgraded at check-in to a suite with a small foyer, a widescreen TV in the sitting room (with a sofa bed) and French doors leading to the bedroom. We were steps from Fifth Avenue, close to Central Park, and even within walking distance of Lincoln Center. This is a fantastic hotel if your destinations in New York include (as ours did) the doll mecca known as American Girl Place, just a few blocks away. So mark one task off your travel to-do list: book the Berkshire; you can hardly do better in the Big Apple."
186,1886,"Jul 17 2007 	Great Service 	My daughter and I stayed at the Omni NY for 5 nights at the start of July. We had originally booked our room through Quikbook reservations but despite having specifically reserved a twin bedded room I was subsequently informed that this could not be guaranted. I contacted reservations at Omni initially with no success. I was on the brink of cancelling when I tried one last time and fortunately a sympathetic call operator confirmed twin beds. So thanks again for that. After that it was plain sailing. The hotel is clean and modern, the room very comfortable (the bed I would have liked to have taken home with me) and the standard of friendliness and helpfulness of the staff exceptional. There is construction noise after 7-00am which is outside the hotel's control but it certainly was not exceptional and did not in any way spoil my enjoyment of a stay in a great hotel."
187,1886,"Jul 15 2007 	Great location great staff great time	My family and I just returned from a week at the Omni. First, we booked our reservation through expedia and paid $199/night plus taxes, which is a very good value for New York. The prior reviews regarding construction are true as a 30 story building is being constructed adjacent to the Omni. Construction begins promptly at 7:00, but we are early risers so the noise didn't bother us. The hotel cannot be faulted for construction noise as they have no control over it. The management and service were splendid. Also, make sure you sign up for the Omni Select membership club, and you will receive morning beverages and newspaper at no additional charge. Also, you'll get free internet access. I am a frequent visitor to N.Y., and have stayed at many different N.Y. hotels. All hotels have very small rooms, so the prior reviews regarding room size are typical of all hotels in Manhattan. The hotel is very clean, has great service, and has a great location. Fifth avenue shopping is only a few steps away, central park is about 1/4 mile, and Rockefeller Center is equally close. I would stay at the Omni again."
188,1886,"Jul 13 2007 	Fantastic Experience	We stayed here during a convention and found it to be extremely nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating from the onset of our stay. The room was very nice, the beds comfortable and the bathrooms well above average. Join their Select Club before your stay and you will enjoy free morning beverages, robes, internet access and your bed turned down nightly with a mint. Close to just about everything Midtown, short walk to Time Square. This is now my hotel of choice for midtown Manhattan."
189,1886,"Jul 10 2007 	Location location location.	A travel website I belong to had an awesome price for this hotel and I booked it for the weekend of July 6 - 8. I orignally booked a room with two double beds. Upon arriving I was told that we would be upgraded to a room with a king size bed and a roll away bed would be brough to our room. We had a party of 4, so we needed at least two beds to accommodate us all. I agreed with the upgrade and roll away bed. Our room was on the 20th floor, lookig out to the construction of the office building next door. The construction did go on on Saturday beginning at 9, so if you are booking a room here, please inquire upon check in about where your room is located. I believe the building that is being built will be done in June of 2008. Our room was beautiful with a couch, desk and king size bed. The bathroom was done up in marble and travertine and was very beautiful. The only complaint I can think off regarding the bathroom is the water pressure. It's a little soft for my taste. The first night we had a few issues with getting the roll away bed, which was to be delivered at 8 and did not end up being brought up. We opted to pull out the couch, which brought up another issue. But all issues were handled efficiently and professionally. I commend the Omni for not treating guest with problems like a nuisance. The turn down service is a nice touch, as is the plate of cookies and juice left the first night. The kids thought this was cool, as was the chocolates left by the pillows.The hotel has a nice workout room with treadmills, ellipticals, weights and medicine balls. On the same floor as the exercise room is a nice balcony where you can go and unwind and get a nice view of St. Patrick's Cathedral.The hotel is in an excellent neighborhood for shopping, as Park Avenue, Rockfeller Center, and Radio City are all mere blocks away. Everyone at the hotel is friendly and accommodating and I would gladly book another stay."
190,1886,"Jul 7 2007 	Just OK	We booked a deluxe King at the Omni. The room was tiny, I mean tiny. The room did not have a closet. Clothing was to be stored in the armoire which was fine except when the doors of the armoire were open you could not get around the bed. Also, if you used the footstool for the casual chair then once again you could not move around the room. After checking in the front desk called to ask how we liked the room. I told them it was unusually small...I was told that all of the deluxe King's have that configuration and oh well. The stopper in the bathtub did not work, the sink faucet was so jiggly that it rotated. The carpet had a major black stain in the center. I'm not sure what is going on in what used to be a lovely hotel."
191,1886,"Jul 6 2007 	Not bad	We chose the Omni Berkshire because we were traveling with our 12yo son and needed a hotel within comfortable walking distance of Broadway, the East Side's museums and shops, and favorite restaurants as well as a largish suite. On all counts, this hotel suited us very well. We did not have trouble with the construction noise because our suite was a bit away from the site - even though the suite was on a lower floor than promised when I made our reservation (in person, with an assistant manager). My son especially liked having his hot cocoa delivered to the room every morning (morning beverages are complimentary, but not always on time - note that this hotel outsources this service). The only real glitch was the door staff. Let's just say they need training on things like opening doors and general demeanor. In addition, the concierge was less helpful than others we've dealt with and had less ability to secure desired restaurant reservations, etc., than we've found with comparable hotels in the city. All in all, we enjoyed our stay, but not enough to book another."
192,1886,"Jul 1 2007 	Great hotel great staff!	I very much enjoyed my stay at the Omni and would definitely stay here again. I was able to get a special deal through Travelzoo so I only paid $199/night. I also signed up for the free Omni Select membership club so I was given two free drinks and national newspapers every morning.I did notice a few small stains on the white comforter, and I didn't have much of a view, but these imperfections were minor compared to the services offered in the hotel (free business center for hotel guests, nice gym, wonderful staff, etc.). The hotel is also steps away from all the best sights in NYC including the MoMA, Fifth Avenue shopping, and tons of great cafes and shopping. Stay at the Omni and you won't be disappointed!"
193,1886,"Jun 8 2007 	Divine locationfor a long weekend of shopping	We booked with a bit of trepidation, as we had read some very mixed reviews on this site and others. However, we had a wonderful experience of the Omni and I have already recommended it to everyone back in the office at home.The building works that are mentioned in other reviews were not an issue for us, as it was Memorial Day weekend, so the construction was halted over the long weekend. Our room was cleaned from top to tail every day, and we found all staff to be friendly and willing to help. We ate one meal in the restaurant, and although the food was good, we did find it a little overpriced for what we ordered. Especially the extra charge of $10 for some chicken with my friend's ceasar salad! All in all, I will return to the Omni in a heartbeat next time I am in New York.Also, it is definitely worth becoming a member of the Omni Select club, as you get free beverages every morning (eg coffee, tea, orange juice), and we found it to be a lovely added extra."
194,1886,"Jun 2 2007 	Omni Always Pleases	REASON FOR VISIT: Weekend trip to attend wedding in Central Park.PROS: I'm a frequent guest at Omni Hotels and as usual everything was nice as expected. Check in was very quick. The room was quite spacious for NYC. Our room even had a small foyer with a mirror and we just had a standard room. The furnishings were nice and well kept. Upon arrival, a staff member took the duvet and decorative pillows off of the bed and tucked them in out of the way storage. The room had a little seating area with a small round marble table. There was also a desk and chair. The bathroom had a few extras like cotton balls and q-tips and robes. There's an office on the second floor equipped with a conference room, desk and chair, and fax and computer with free internet access. CONS: We had to wait to get the attention of a valet to take our car away. By the way, there is only valet parking available which is $40/day. Our room faced a loud construction site. Luckily they shortly stopped working after 5 pm. Don't expect a quite room during the day though.OTHER: The hotel has a really nice restaurant. It feels like your in a cozy dining room, not a restaurant. The chairs are like real dining chairs and leather big comfy chairs that you would find in an upscale home. The food was good and they even have a selection of organic foods. The atmosphere is very peaceful. FYI, the hotel is right off of 5th Avenue so there is plenty of shopping and activities in the area. We walked up 5th Avenue to Central Park. Also, try the Top of the Rock."
195,1886,"May 25 2007 	Omni better than ever	We stayed here last weekend in spite of the noise issues. I spoke directly to the hotel in advance and they made sure we got a very high room so the noise on Mon. am was negligible. It seems to me that years ago we were on the Madison Ave. side of the building on the fifth floor and were awakened by garbage trucks in the middle of the night. Hey, it's New York...the city that never sleeps! Everyone on staff was terrific and welcoming. The room (on the 19th) was lovely and spotless, the halls totally quiet. The food in the Fireside Grill was wonderful. It's still the best location in New York, sophisticated but not overcrowded like the larger hotels near or on Times Square, a walk away from everything.I got the best price by speaking directly to the hotel reservations people. There was never anything on the web close to what we paid for several months."
196,1886,"May 16 2007 	Very comfortable and efficient	O think it is very overpriced but then again, it seems the whole of New York is the same!!Not everything went to plan, but to be fair, any issues we raised were sorted out with immediate effect.Staff were wonderful, very friendly and helpful.Rooms immaculately clean.Overall, I would gladly stay here again but the price would have to drop. 1750 for room only, 6 nights, I personally think is expensive.Location was pretty good.As regards the building works, we did not have ANY disturbance whatsoever."
197,1886,"May 2 2007 	Unbelievable for a hotel of this supposed category	Truly unbelievable to be awaken by construction at 7 am.As a previous reviewer posted it is outright dishonest not to advise guests.I spent $459 a night for a tiny room, this &quot;special wake-up call&quot; and increasinlgy indifferent service.I usually stayed either at the Omni or at The Regency.Guess who is having my business from now on"
198,1886,"Apr 29 2007	Loved It!	We stayed two nights back in December. We had a great stay. There was construction going on but I don't think it was as far along in the process as it is now. We loved the Omni and we got a great deal. We really couldn't have been happier about it. I think we paid $199, well worth it."
199,1886,"Apr 26 2007 	DO NOT STAY HERE!! Construction works are a TOTAL nightmare	April 26th 2007When I &quot;arrived&quot; I was told that there were construction works. That was a slight understatment, these construction works are massive and ruined the stay at the hotel. From 7am on the dot they start, and the noise levels are huge.I was initially on the 17th floor over looking the works, and it was dreadful, hte room actually felt like it was shaking.I moved to over look Maddison Ave, it was better, but not as it should have been. I would NOT recommend this hotel whilst these extensive works are going on.The barman was rude (to everyone), and the staff at breakfast were not great and always seemed to get our orders wrong.On the positive, its a great location for shopping, the rooms were nice &amp; spacious, although bathroom a bit out dated.The bar area was really nice.Concierge helpful.Once these works have been done Im sure this would be a great place to stay.But definitely NOT whilst the works are going on.Hope to have helped"
200,1886,Apr 20 2007	Can't wait to go back	My husband and I spent a weekend at the Omni and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel and it's staff. I had stayed at the hotel on business years ago and enjoyed my stay then. I was uncertain that the quality would still be there. IT WAS!! We arrived early and quite frazzled from the drive (the tunnel entrance was a nightmare) We were checked in early and upgraded at no additional cost. The room was beautiful and the staff was friendly and helpful (especially Lenny the doorman). We will definitely be back.
201,1886,"Apr 19 2007 	Excellent experience at the Omni	I selected the Omni Berkshire for the weekend of April 14 - 16 based on strong Trip Advisor reviews, so thanks to all! I planned the weekend as a very special birthday celebration for my Mom, who had never visited NYC before. I'm pleased to report that the Omni was an outstanding part of a great weekend, the Nor'easter notwithstanding!Before traveling to the hotel, I called and spoke to a manager about our special occasion, asking for a nice room on an upper floor. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a junior suite on the 19th floor. It was lovely, clean, spacious, and quiet. The hotel also surprised us by sending up a bottle of champagne with a birthday card for my Mom, who was thrilled at the thoughtful gesture. Our dealings with all personnel - front desk, concierge, doormen, and housekeeping staff - were uniformly pleasant and professional. We felt very &quot;looked after&quot; at all times.As others have commented, it is a good deal to join Omni's free &quot;select guest&quot; program. As a result, you get complementary breakfast beverages and a newspaper delivered to your door. Our morning order was right on time and well-presented.The location of the Omni could not be better - corner of Madison and E. 52nd - so you are in the heart of mid-town Manhattan. Since we were there on a weekend (and checked out before 8 a.m. on Monday morning) we did not experience the construction noise that has been mentioned by many others. In fact, I thought the hotel was exceptionally quiet, but our 19th floor location no doubt helped in that regard.I did not have occasion to check out the fitness or business facilities, so cannot comment on that. I travel with some frequency for business and pleasure, and I can say without a doubt that the Omni is an excellent property at an outstanding location with an emphasis on customer service that is notable in this day and age. I plan on using the Omni for future travel to NYC and also trying Omni in other cities, based upon this positive experience.Thanks to everyone at the Omni Berkshire for a great weekend! I'll be back!"
202,1886,"Apr 17 2007 	Great Hotel but noisy!	Stayed here over Easter 2007. As we arrived I realised I had left a bag on the Super Shuttle transfer. The concierge (Randy) at the Omni couldn't do enough to try and get my bag back. Super Shuttle were hopeless and not interested, even hanging up when I'm explaining the situation. The bag was obviously stolen. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN.Anyway, Randy obtained some vital medical supplies and helped me report the bag to the NYPD. Rooms were comfortable and very clean. Like other reviewers we were disturbed by the demolition of a building adjacent to the hotel. Over Easter Saturday and Sunday it abaited but returned with a vengence on Easter Monday. The whole hotel seemed to be shaking. It is a shame as the hotel is very well located and we would consider staying there again. Five stars but forthe noise."
203,1886,"Apr 12 2007 	Disappointed in Omni	I've been staying at the Omni Berkshire for business every week for 9 weeks (our company has a preferred rate). It is such a disappointment that I thought I should share my experience on here. The biggest complaint is about the front desk service and concierge service. The front desk staff are unapproachable and unfriendly. On two different occassions they have sent me up to a room that was not cleaned (beds not made, one smelled like armpit). The concierge is not very helpful. My colleague asked them to look up the nearest Prada store and they said it was somewhere on Fifth. No directions, no &quot;can I check the hours for you&quot;, only a &quot;its' on Fifth somewhere&quot;. The only friendly staff are the doorsmen (at least they smile) and the repair guy.A major issue with the hotel right now is that there is major construction right beside it. They start drilling and banging at 8am - so don't try to sleep in! When you reserve or check in, ask for a room away from the construction -- this will help a little bit.The rooms themselves are ok, but not what you'd expect from a luxury hotel. In some rooms the phones have a bad connection, the electrical socket on the lamp is broken and I've had to have someone come up to fix the tv twice (a nice and friendy fellow).If I had the choice, I would not stay here."
204,1886,"Apr 11 2007 	Beware the construction noise!!!	My husband and I booked an easter weekend break at the Omni Berkshireafter reading the great reviews about the hotel on this site. Some ofit is true: the location is great, close to shops, subway and major attractions. The Preferred Guest perk of free room service drinks in the mornings is a fabulous touch that we really appreciated. The hotel is clean, and the housekeeping was certainly up to scratch. We were able to get a late check out which helped with our night flight home, and the Business Centre let us check in for our flights online without charging us standard usage rates (just as well - the standardrates are ridiculously high!) The Fireside bar/restaurant was a nice spot to stop for a bite or a drink too - if only the rest of the hotel was as stylish as it's bar.The bad stuff did overshadow our stay. Luckily we were there over a holiday weekend, which meant that we weren't aware of the noise from major construction going on outside our window until 6.30 am on the morning we were checking out. But what noise! I have always lived in downtown locations, so am used to a bit of background noise from the streets below. But we were on the 14th floor and the noise was deafening! If the hotel aren't warning guests of this in advance, they should at least be offering ear plugs instead of chocolates with the nightly turn down service. I did think about stuffing my ears with the chocolate wrappers! Had we been staying there mid-week when the construction was ongoing, I would have had to request a change of rooms. This construction site is huge and looks to be ongoing for some time to come, so be sure to check ahead and request a room away from the noise, or get earplugs at least.Worse than this though, was that my parents had arranged for champagne and strawberries to be sent to our room as a surprise sinceit was our wedding anniversary during our stay. I didn't find out about this surprise until I got home and my parents asked about it - we did not receive it. The hotel appear to have delivered it to the wrong room, despite my mum confirming all the details with them on the day we checked in. I called the hotel when my mum told me about this arrangement to find out what happened - the staff on the phone were not helpful. I had to repeat my story to at least four differentmembers of staff. A manager did not call me back as promised, and when I eventually made enough follow up calls, all I got was a weak apology. They did not call my mum to apologize at all. This is not the level of customer service this hotel seems to pride itself on, and my experience of their issue management was very unsatisfactory.On the whole, a lot of the positive things that have been said about the Omni Berkshire on this site are true, but I still wouldn't chooseto stay here again, and definitely not until the construction at 53rdand Madison is complete. It's lacking in style, the staff overlooked some pretty major things during our stay and handled a problem situation very badly indeed. There are enough good hotels in NYC to prevent the Omni Berkshire being a top choice."
205,1886,"Apr 7 2007 	Great Stay	We just got back from a great stay at the Omni Bershire. We went with our 10 year old son to see a Yankees game- which was rained out but was able to get tickets for the next day's game. First visit to NYC and was leary about the trip being from the South, however the hotel was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was bigger that expected for NYC and very clean and close to walk to most attractions. The doormen and conceirge guys were very helpful and friendly with ideas of where to eat and visit. The first night the staff brought up cookies and milk and then chocolates and slippers. Isadora's cafe across the street is a great and cheaper place to eat breakfast, lunch or dinner. Felt very safe on the subways also. Got a better rate a hotels.com(about $300.00 per night). Be prepared to spend alot for everything in NYC."
206,1886,"Mar 31 2007 	Another great stay at the Omni	This was our 4th stay at the Omni in about 6 years. You can't beat the location and the rooms are so comfortable. We had booked a Deluxe and were upgraded to a Superior, I assume because we are part of the Select Guest program. Upon check in, we were told that the front desk was out of the free beverage vouchers that Select Guest members get and that they would be delivered to our room that evening. We never received them. Granted, we never inquired about them again, but I would say this was the only glitch in our stay. I also have to agree with the last review which mentioned how fantastic the doormen are. Lenny has been there since we started staying there and even if he really doesn't remember us, he always acts like he does. He is great! Also, there is construction going on behind the building. I'm not sure there would be any room where you wouldn't hear it, but we were always anxious to get up and out early anyway. It usually started around 7:30 am but they didn't work on the weekends.I'm hoping to stay there again over the 4th of July. We can't get enough of the Omni."
207,1886,"Mar 30 2007 	Loved this hotel	Simple as this ... we loved this hotel. We loved the bar and restaurant (Fireside) too. Room service was great, staff were friendly, location is perfect ... absolutely nothing to complain about!"
208,1886,"Mar 27 2007 	Downtown Manhattan -loved it	My wife and I traveled up to New York city for a little get away. We stayed at the omni through hotels.com and the hotel was more than perfect. Turn down service, great bar &amp; restaurant. The rooms had tray ceilings and they were terrific. Shower was huge and comfortable. We walked every where- broadway, times square, flea market on the weekend. It was great and the door men make this hotel. We never talked to the desk or the concierge, the door men took care of everything!"
209,1886,"Mar 20 2007 	FRIENDLY/HELPFUL	Nice place, we stayed here on friday 3-16-07 (mini blizzard) to sunday 3-18-07. we were in town for the Saint Patrick's Day parade, which is less than a block walking distance, very convenient, we could hear the parade from the room, nice. Very close to radio city and rock. center which we walked to often. Spotless room, all around staff was very friendly and helpful, we would definately return."
210,1886,"Mar 19 2007 	Loved it!	Genuinely friendly staff. Clean rooms, nice amenities. Informative and AVAILABLE concierge. (I've stayed other places where you could never reach the concierge by phone, and then would have to wait in lines in the lobby.) Great location (near Rockefeller Plaza). Hotel program worth joining (free breakfast beverages, free internet access, turn-down service with chocolates). Will definitely stay again."
211,1886,"Mar 14 2007 	Great Stay	The Omni was comfortable and clean. We had a group of 3 rooms, and one check-in incident. We all had requested non-smoking and had to stay in a smoking room for one night, then was switched. Other than that, it was an enjoyable stay. The hotel restaraunt was very expensive ($7 for a cup of tea), however I heard the food was good. The concierge staff was fantastic and very helpful, especially in making recommendations and directions. The location was great; blocks (1-5) from shopping, subway, and Rockefeller Plaza, and theatres."
212,1886,"Mar 11 2007	Pretty Ridiculous	I had read all the great reviews on this hotel, so I decided to stay here this past weekend. I have literally stayed at every hotel in NY and this was pretty bad. We were supposed to have a superior room, but due to delayed flight we didnt check into the hotel until 1 am. They had sold our room and stuck us in a double room. the room was so small, you couldnt pass somebody at the foot of the bed. Smalest hotel I have ever been in. We had a fantastic view outside of city workers tearing down a building which started at 5 am each morning and didnt end till 9 at night everyday. I feel that the hotel should have given guest some warning as to the noise level outside, or have discounted the rooms that had that noise. Never had room service so I cant tell you how that was. One of the elevators was out of service so you waited a minimum of 10 minutes on your floor to get into an overly packed elevator. Room key on two occasions didnt work, and we had loud neighbors in the room next door. I dont recommend this hotel to anyone. especially if you are used to a more higher end hotel!"
213,1886,"Feb 27 2007	Great! Really pleased we changed to the Omni!	We originally booked the Novotel, but after talking to an experienced friend, we decided to opt for a different area! We chose the Omni as they were offering stay three nights get fourth free!! Although this deal attracted us, we later found a better price on ---.com and were very pleased.The hotel is in a fantastic location, between 5th Avenue and Madison. We walked nearly everywhere as everything was so close.The room was really clean and well furnished. A liitle on the small side, but as we only slept there at the end of the day, it didn't matter, as it was really comfortable.You must go to toysrus and see the huge carousel and the T'rex!! Oh and we recommend the Bubbagump shrimp company restaurant in Times Square!!"
214,1886,Feb 20 2007 	Very Nice Accomodation Great Service	The hotel was very clean and the furnishings nice. Staff was very efficient and friendly enough. Location is convenient to businesses in the area but it is not necessarily in the main tourist area.
215,1886,"Feb 19 2007 	Excellent weekend stay at the Omni Berkshire Place	Just back from a President's Day weekend stay at the Omni Berkshire Place. We generally have a bias against the chains and were looking for more of a boutique hotel such as the Muse (which we've loved in the past), but after seeing the extremely low rate and extremely positive reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to book the Omni and take the risk that our stay might not be quite as &quot;special.&quot; In short, I'm not going to tell you anything that hasn't been covered by the other reviews here. I joined the Omni frequent guest program and requested a high room away from the construction. Our room was very quiet and quite large for New York, modern and clean, luxurious if not overly formal, king bed with plump down pillows &amp; duvet, real 3-way lights, CD/Stereo, large bathroom with good lighting, plenty of water pressure, 2 large cotton robes, complimentary high speed internet and beverages delivered to our room each morning with the Times. The hotel staff was very well trained and professional, eager to meet our every need. In short, we were thrilled, and not just because it was a bargain. I would stay at the Omni Berkshire again without hesitation."
216,1886,"Feb 19 2007	Location location location!!!	This hotel is all about location...if you are a shopper, than I suggest you stay here. It is sandwiched between 5th and Madison, with great shopping surrounding it. The concierge were fairly helpful. The doorman had a hard time hailing cabs due to the horrific weather and the location on a side street heading east bound, so most times we had to hoof it to 5th Ave and grab a cab at the corner. We were there in the coldest week of January for a big birthday. I nearly froze to death as I am from Miami, thus the complaining.As a healthy eater, there isn't really anything around the hotel, unless you want to go to Whole foods or cab it downtown where all the organic healthy places are.The rooms are decent and the water pressure was good. I didn't eat any meals at the hotel except tea and spinach, so I can't really comment on the dining at the hotel.One thing that stands out is when I was trying to hook up my computer, the tech support was great, so, okay,thumbs up to that!!Also, because of it's location on a side street, the rooms were quiet, so that may be a plus for you if the traffic noise bothers light sleepers.They are close to American girl and even had one at the front desk. Unfortunately, I didn't have my 9 year old with me because she would have blown a gasket seeing &quot;Molly&quot; perched on the desk&quot;!!! Amercian girl is close by and every little girl loves that place.Would I stay there again, no, but then again I did not pick the place, but depending on your needs, the place was a great value and if you are looking for location, it is a good place with a nice staff.I think if I was there in May, I would have much better things to say, however I was too busy warming up and scrounging for food during my stay."
217,1886,"Feb 12 2007 	Wonderful stay at Omni Berkshire	My husband I spent a lovely Saturday night at the Omni Berkshire Place on 1/27/07. I booked the hotel room through their website and got a great government discount. I had read prior reviews on TripAdvisor regarding current construction, so I e-mailed the hotel advising them that we were spending the night as part of my husband's birthday celebration and requesting that we be placed on a high level floor away from the construction noise. When we checked in, I was given the rate quoted online for the requested non-smoking, king bed room. We were pleasantly surprised, however, when we entered our room on the 19th floor. Apparently this is an all-suite floor. We had one of what they consider to be their &quot;smaller&quot; suites, but could not have been happier with the room. The separate living area was rather large, with a pull-out sofa, several chairs, a desk, a flat screen t.v., minibar, and several floor to ceiling windows which lead out to a wrap-around balcony (we were in a corner suite). The bathroom was luxurious, with a large soaking tub, oversized shower, plenty of counter space, fluffy towels and lovely amenities. The bedroom itself was at least as large, if not larger, than some of the other hotel rooms we have stayed at in the past, and again had floor to ceiling windows, a t.v. in the armoire, and a loveseat. In addition, both the living area and the bedroom had their own digital thermostat controls. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to spend a special evening or two in the city. The room was wonderful, and every member of staff that we came into contact with, especially the concierge, was incredibly helpful. One helpful hint that has been mentioned in other postings on this board - sign up for their Select Guest program prior to booking your room. Upon check-in, you will be given a menu with several beverage options, and can choose up to two to be delivered to your room at a time of your choice free of charge. Considering how expensive room service can be, this was a most welcome added &quot;bonus.&quot;"
218,1886,"Feb 11 2007 	A well-run solid four star hotel	I just returned from a weekend at the Omni Berkshire and was pleasantly surprised by the hotel quality and the professional service. The rooms were modern, well-appionted, clean, and had excellent beds, and the public areas were very high quality. The service matched the quality of the rooms. A particularly nice touch was occured when both of the doormen kindly asked if we had remembered things easily forgotten: cell phones and battery chargers.The best part about the stay was the Omni &quot;Select Guest&quot; benefits provided by the hotel. After signing up for their free frequent guest &quot;Select Guest&quot; program, the hotel provides free wi-fi and free morning, in-room delivery of a large range of hot and cold beverages and newspapers. It is a very nice touch.In my opinion, the Omni Berkshire is a solid four star property and I'll stay here again."
219,1886,"Feb 8 2007 	Great Hotel! Great Location!	We stayed at the Omni in January for one night as we had tickets for a broadway play. When you turn onto the street for the hotel, if you blink, you might pass it. We had to go back around. Once there, however, the bell captain and valet came right up to us and took our luggage and car. We arrived a bit early, but had no difficulties getting our room right away.The room itself was spacious with 2 beds and a good-size bathroom. The bathroom was very nicely appointed in marble and had plenty of toiletries and extra towels (something I really cherish in a hotel). The hotel had wireless internet and a good number of TV channels.The hotel is located very close to Times Square in the heart of the Theatre District. The concierge was very (very) friendly and directed us to a wonderful restaurant and a nice place for dessert after the play. I had very specific requests and she fulfilled them exactly.If you join their guest program, they have some little perks like getting free beverages delivered to your room in the morning. The hot chocolate was delicious!All in all a very nice stay. Friendly, courteous staff, great location, clean room and nicely stocked bathroom. The wonderful performance of The Lion King topped off a great weekend!"
220,1886,"Feb 1 2007 	Brilliant location nice rooms. Recommended!	I stayed here with my mom and sister on a girls shopping trip in November. The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping on Madison and 5th. It's really near to Saks, walkable to Barneys and Henri Bendel and a short cab ride to Bloomies!The rooms were of a good size for NYC and very comfortable and quiet. Muted colours, fairly standard for a 4-5* hotel. Bathroom was spacious and clean with some nice freebies and a hairdryer. We didn't eat in the hotel but used the deli opposite which was great for a coffee and bagel in the morning!Only complaint is that we couldnt get the internet in the room to work but this was then taken off our bill and we were invited to use the connections in the business centre which was v well equipped. Nice hotel, lovely rooms, GREAT location!"
221,1886,"Jan 19 2007 	Great	Hotel was great. We booked a regular twin room and were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite. The room was very spacious, and usually rooms in NYC are small. Great amenities too. Join the special guest program and morning juice and coffee is delivered free from room service. The staff was absolutly magnificent. We stay here every Christmas and the doorman remembered us. I wouldn't stay anywhere else.We got a really low price from one of the discount websites, called the hotel and booked thru them and they matched the price, even gave us an early check in at 11AM and late check out at 5PM. Almost unheard of in hotels these days."
222,1886,"Jan 18 2007 	fantastic visit to the city	I have stayed at the omni at least ten times in the past years. this year was the first time for some of my friends as we went for the tree lighting and shopping for christmas. Everything was better than it has ever been, the renovations to the facility are outstanding. the staff was extremely nice and helpful as usual , my friends were very impressed with the entire facility. the rooms have been renovated and are large compared to most hotels in new york. the concierge was very helpful in providing us reservations at a number of clubs and restraurants.Number one place in new york as far as i am concerned. the location cannot be beat for shopping and site seeing. christmas was beautiful in the city and the omni made it all better."
223,1886,"Jan 14 2007	A Perfect Stay	What can I say about this wonderful hotel. The location is ideal between 5th and Madison and within walking distance to the best shopping the city has to offer. The rooms were large by New York standards and we luxurious and spotless. There was a stocked mini bar and snack basket, though a bit overpriced. The bathrooms had upscale Bulvagri lotion and shampoo and Dutch soaps that were quite nice. The bed was extremely comfortable and the turndown service with the mint on the pillow was an added touch. Even the extremely comfortable queen pullout sofa was setup for us ever night. The room also included a large plasma TV. The concierge was very helpful at finding the perfect restaurant for the evening and helping us venture out of the city. Though I have been to New York countless times, this hotel has left an indelible image of New York luxury in my mind. This is a must stay."
224,1886,"Jan 14 2007 	Superb Location	Stayed: Jan 11th to 14thLocation of Hotel: Superb. Rockerfeller centre is just round the corner, an easy walk to the museums, perfect for shopping in Madison, 57th and Park Avenue, Grand Central an easy 10 blocks downtown. Have visited NYC four times and this is by far the best location I've stayed in.Hotel Room: Good size for NYC, very clean, very comfortable bed, nice deep tub to soak in. There is a construction site to the rear of the hotel but I didnt notice any excessive noise - the double glazing cuts out a lot. My room was on the 14th Floor overlooking the site - I wasnt put off by this at all but I guess if you were on a lower floor it would probably be more noticeable. Staff: Found them to be very pleasant and helpful. Select Guest Program: Everyone should sign up to this - just log onto the Omni website and plug in your details and youre done. Front desk staff gave me the request tags to hang on the door when I checked in - Coffee, Juice, iced water and the NY Times arrived every morning at the time I requested it - a nice freebie to have.Would I stay again? : Yes absolutely"
225,1886,"Jan 10 2007 	Would definately stay again	Thanks to mommy2cheyenne, I became a &quot;Select Guest&quot; before our stay. We got comp. Starbucks coffee - 2 pots - delivered to our door at our requested time each morning (there isn't a coffee pot in the room). I also mentioned that it was my birthday, and the hotel had a bottle of sparkling wine waiting for us that evening (comp. too!).The room was clean and well appointed - no closet, just a wardrobe to hang your clothes. Really nice bath. King sized - comfy beds with fluffy down comforters. We've stayed at the Grand Hyatt previously and this was a much nicer hotel, the Hyatt was dingy compared. We were on the 9th floor and did hear the construction, and the walls are thin - bring your earplugs!! (Which is why this got 4 rather than 5 stars)The location is perfect. A block to Rock. Plaza, a short walk to Central Park and Times Square."
226,1886,Jan 9 2007 	Great Stay	I can sum up this hotel in two words; Fantastic stay. Nothing else needs to be stated
227,1886,"Jan 3 2007 	We enjoyed it!	We stayed at the Omni over Christmas. The room was clean and, byt NYC standards, a good size. The area the hotel is located in IS pretty noisy, but as long as you keep the thick windows shut, you wont hear any of it!Loved the new bar Fireside! We went down there each night and had a few drinks, the bartender and manager we great and made the experience great!"
228,1886,"Dec 28 2006 	Loved it!	We loved this hotel. They let us check in early, gave us a free upgrade and gave my daughter a bag of goodies to keep. The room was decorated nicely. We had a King room with a sofa, desk, and huge windows! The beds are the most comfortable beds ever!! Every morning we got complimentary hot chocolate and cokes and two different newspapers delivered right to our door. The day of our check out they gave us a strbucks gift card, too! WE WILL STAY HERE AGAIN!!! The only thing that we would mention is that there is some construction going on outside that may be bothersome to people on the lower floors; we were on the 18th floor so we just heard a faint humming noise. Oh, the food sevice is very expensive. An 8 oz glass bottle of coke is $6.50, but there are so many place close by that you can eat from. We had no choice but to order room service our first day because it was Christmas day and a lot of places were closed. My daughter got mini burgers, my husband got chicked breast, and we also got 3 cokes, the bill came to $96 !!"
229,1886,Dec 21 2006 	Tired	The rooms on average are small.Small defined as impossible to move around in if the ironing board is out.The decor is a little tired in the rooms.The room only had one accessible power outlet that is part of a lamp and not suitable for adapters.There is major construction next door that looks like it has a year to go.I was not warned about this but was in a room where due to the noise i soon discovered it for myself.Ask not to be put on the back wall of the hotel.The gym is out of date and not well maintained.The missing foot straps on the bike have not been replaced in two years.Unless you order USA today you will not get your paper of choice.Over all an underwhelming place.
230,1886,"Dec 19 2006	Omni Berkshire was Great!	We stayed at the Omni Berkshire (52nd and Madison Ave) the week of Thanksgiving. The hotel was great! Staff was very pleasant and helpful. They had hot chocolate out in the afternoon when we came in from sightseeing. They brought the newspaper, coffee and hot chocolate to our room in the morning. There was even a small welcome pack for our 7 year old daughter when we arrived. The location was very convenient. We'll definitely stay there on our next trip."
231,1886,"Dec 13 2006 	Fantastic hotel dont think me and the previous person were in the same hotel!!!	we stayed at the omni berkshire place for 3 nights on the 7th dec 2006. The staff were very friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. we had a deluxe double room booked which was fantastic and rather large. It was very clean and well decorated. The bathroom was large, clean and well lit. The location is fantastic it is between fifth ave and madison ave and only about a 2 miniute walk from the rockafeller centre, 15mins from times square and 15mins from central park. The previous person said in their review that it was noisy outside all night long, we did not find this to be the case and we were on the 3rd floor. They also said that the walls were thin and you could hear other peoples conversation again we did not find this to be the case. we were overall very happy with the hotel and we joined the select guest program so we had free tea/coffee/orange and ice water delivered to our door at our specified time every monrning on the dot without fail.We would definatley stay in this hotel again and would recommend it. The only thing i would say is when you need to book at taxi to get the airport, you will struggle between 3-6pm as the taxis go off duty to change drivers. we were told this so we booked a private car through the concierge. This was more expensive but we thought it would be worth it instead of struggling to get a taxi. We were WRONG. We booked our car for 5pm but it didn't show up until 6pm. We paid $133 for this service to get to Newark airport and we thought the service was poor for the price. Never book a car through the concierge they triple the price always ask the doorman first as they have their own car service and would only charge $75 no tip , no toll."
232,1886,"Dec 2 2006	Big Disappointment!	Big Disappointment!If you want to sleep, then fine other hotel. We spent three nights at the Omni Berkshire Place last week. Here are the comments: 1. The Price: We have paid a holiday premier, $619 per night for a double-room, which is fine, but not with a ten-inch hole [--].2. Room Condition: The room needs a serious facelift. Stain, pill-off wall paper all over the places. 3. Bathroom: It is small marble bath with a thick layer of dust over the lamp. That may be the reason they keep the bathroom very dark.4. Public Space: Lobby is old and dirty, nothing but chairs cover by layers of grease. We didnt event want to look at it. Corridor is ok, but again is old. 5. Service: General is ok. If they can make our room services correct which are wrong twice out of our three orders. Service people in the lobby are in a snobby side. 6. The Location: It is a good midtown location. The trade off is the noise from streets which ran all night. If you do not want to wake up at 3:30AM by the garbage truck, other location would be an ideal. 7. Insulation: There is NO insulation at all. We can hear the guests conversation from the next door with our TV on. I have spent in hotel intensely, but never have any experience close to this one. This stay by far is the worst hotel experience I ever have. The interesting thing is that I did not real get angry. Simply, with the price gorging, my expectation has been set very low, but the Omni Berkshire can even go lower then that. It is unbelievable."
233,1886,"Nov 27 2006 	Excellent Location	2 adults and 1 child stayed at the Omni Berkshire before Thanksgiving. The location is unsurpassed...walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Broadway-Times Square, and Central Park. Hotel staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable on local sites and restaraunts. Rooms are a little small, but very well kept. Will stay there again."
234,1886,"Nov 15 2006 	Great experience Great Room Great Location - Loved it!	It was our first trip to NYC, and we knew we wanted to be centrally located - so we started by literally pointing at &quot;mid-Midtown&quot; on a map and chose the Omni Berkshire Place pretty much on location alone, with the exception of a good experience once at the Omni in Chicago. The hotel &amp; staff totally exceeded our expectations! The Deluxe room was clean, had a great layout, and was far more spacious than I was warned hotels in New York would be. This may sound a bit strange, but I was ecstatic with the bathroom as it was huge, had a high shower head (I'm tall), and had very bright lights &amp; lots of counter space to spread out all of my personal care &amp; beauty products for 5 days. Also, the room was virtually sound proof &amp; the beds were extremely comfortable. The staff was always friendly, we could easily get a cab or town car at every hour of the day/evening. Housekeeping did a great job, the concierge was a big help, and there was a cash machine in the lobby, which came in handier than I thought it would. You don't have a young, hip vibe here, but it's a nice, solid place that felt good to come back to after a long day of exploring.Staying here, you are virtually steps from St. Patrick's Cathedral &amp; Fifth Avenue, blocks away from Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Broadway, and Central Park - they are all easy and pleasant to walk to. The subway is quite close as well. I might stay in a different section of Manhattan a time or two on future visits to broaden my experience, but I'm sure I'll be back at the Omni again and sincerely recommend it if you're looking for what we called &quot;Manhattan 101&quot; during our trip. I never tried the restaurants at the hotel - there were plenty of dining options in close proximity that are good quality and reasonably priced."
235,1886,"Nov 11 2006 	A really wonderful hotel in every way	I really love this hotel. The location (52nd and Madison) cannot be beat for business or pleasure. It is a luxurious European style hotel that understands what makes a stay special. I have stayed at the Standhope, Parker Meridien, the Dillon, the Peninsula, and the Hudson so far and this is my favorite next to the Standhope. It was so elegant and comfortable the moment I walked in through the door. There were beautiful and well chosen fresh flower arrangements throughout the common areas. Unlike so many hotels now, the hallways were nicely appointed and well lit with pretty ceiling fixtures. My standard room was immaculately clean with lovely and comfortable furnishings that you might find in a nice house, not a hotel. The minibar had nice gourmet treats (loved the Dean &amp; Deluca gummi bears) and the window opened for fresh air. The bathroom was all marble and well stocked with everything a traveler would need. One of the things that I hate about many hotels is the lack of lighting, or the use of compact fluorescents. Not a problem here. Every lamp had a three way 150 watt bulb, which meant that I could actually see in the room and do work. What a luxury. The gym was small but very well outfitted with nice TVs everywhere, an ample fruit bowl, and complimentary sports drink. My only complaint is that the hotel actually charges to receive faxes at a $1/page."
236,1886,"Nov 11 2006 	Good value but avoid the Restaurant	My daughter and I have just returned from 3 nights (Nov. 3 - 5/06)at the Omni Berkshire Place Hotel in Manhattan. Overall the experience was very good, with one caution: the restaurant.Our room was very nice, well appointed, and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bar fridge was well stocked, turn-down service left chocolates nightly and the staff was always courteous and helpful.The location - 52nd &amp; Madison - is excellent. Only the Fireside Dining Room left us shaking our heads. Apparently it is scheduled to re-open mid-November 2006, following renovations which are just now being completed. We were advised that it was not yet open to the public, but that hotel guests were welcome to try the new menu.There were so many things wrong with the experience that we left wondering what the Chef could have been thinking! My daughter ordered an appetizer of &quot; 4 mini burgers&quot; and a &quot;Caesar Stack&quot; salad, which promised to include anchovies. I ordered Osso Bucco.The &quot;4 mini burgers&quot; appetizer turned out to be a whole burger cut into quarters with a side of fries - a meal - not an appetizer!The &quot;Caesar Stack&quot; was alternating layers of romaine and red leaf lettuce, sprinkled with a vinaigrette dressing and parmesan flakes. The anchovies were on crostini on the side! There was not even a hint of Caesar dressing.The Osso Bucco was tasty but arrived an a plate so tiny that it was actually difficult to use a knife and fork to cut the meat off the bone.The new decor leaves a lot to be desired: including stainless steel tables which are COLD!The bottom line: Manhattan offers so many wonderful eateries, there is no need to dine in at the Omni Berkshire Place. It is still a good hotel with everything else to recommend it. We paid US$399/night which is not only a NY bargain. It's a particularly good price for the quality of the room and the staff."
237,1886,"Oct 31 2006	Excellent	If you are travelling to NYC for business reasons this is highly recommended.You have variety of options with respect to dining, travelling and activities after work.Based on whats the reason for the trrip it is at the Center/ Heart of Manhattan - perfect ofr busines stravellers."
238,1886,"Oct 28 2006 	Join Select Guest for morning coffee and juice room service!	Just stayed at the Omni Berkshire and it was a very pleasant experience. The room was really large (for New York standards) with a great bathroom (very nice bath amenities, too). Beds are cozy and turndown service is a nice touch. Staff was friendly and helpful. I am a member of Omni's Select Guest program and you simply MUST become a member if you plan to stay here (or any Omni hotel - we also love the one in San Diego). Joining is free and I was surprised to discover that if you tell them you are a select guest member, they will deliver coffee and juice to your room in the morning, FREE OF CHARGE! It was great to wake up to room service coffee and fresh grapefruit juice at no charge. We are staying here again on New Year's Eve. The Omni really knows how to do it right. Hunt around for great deals - we got our room for $500 less than the Omni website charges by using Quikbook."
239,1886,"Oct 23 2006 	Great Service Great Hotel	This was our first stay in NYC and we wanted something close to midtown. We also wanted a baby-friendly hotel. This hotel exceeded our expectations. Exceptional service. Rooms were immaculate. Concierge service was invaluable. Hotel was just a few minutes from MoMA, Rockefeller Center, Broadway and Central Park. We were certainly impressed with the Room Service director who provided complimentary in room full breakfast for two because of technical problems in delivering our order the night before. A fine hotel. We will stay there again during our next visit to New York."
240,1886,"Sep 29 2006 	Umm... No where near as good as it used to be	Ohh dear..... I stayed in the Omni Berkshire a couple of years ago and it was truly fantastic. Time has not been good on the omni. The rooms are now looking tired, the restaurant and bar were both closed for refurbishment (we were only warned about the restaurant on booking), the reception staff were down and out right rude, the only staff member I would praise was the Concierge, she was great!! Got woken up at 8.30 by a hotel engineer who just let himself in to my room despite the Do not Disturb sign, and he then did it again when I was packing at 4.30pm!!! This is not a cheep hotel, and has a long way to go if it ever wants to be as good as it used to be. Shame, as I had recommended it to my colleague, and we were both extremely disappointed. Won't go back again in a rush."
241,1886,"Sep 4 2006 	Second Outstanding Stay	We first stayed at the Omni Berkshire Place in April of '06. We had a palatial room that was spotless. Service and amenities were excellent. The only negative was the food in the restaurant, which was lousy, but they've since closed the restaurant for renovation.Our second stay was over Labor Day weekend '06. We were given a complimentary upgrade on check in and enjoyed another outstanding stay. I've stayed in many hotels in New York City - with problems ranging from small rooms, not clean, freeze/fry showers, clog prone toilets, noisy (these are all four star hotels I'm referring to). The Omni offers consistently the highest standards of any place I've stayed in Manhattan."
242,1886,"Jul 26 2006 	Pleasantly surprised	Stayed 6 nights at the Omni over the 4th of July holiday. Rooms were great, much bigger than most New York hotels and very elegant top to bottom. Staff was VERY helpful in all matters from wake up calls to dinner reservations or extra towels. EVERY time we left the room the maid was in to tidy up, fill ice bucket, or turn down beds. Located in a quiet area that is very well located for whatever you may be doing in Manhattan. The only bad experience was the doormen, totally useless and rude. Upon arriving in a rain storm our doorman watched from inside until we unloaded all our bags and got them in the lobby. Usually when we needed a cab they were smoking, talking on cell phone, or being rude to another guest, if I were in charge I would fire the whole bunch and start over. That being said, how hard is it to open your own door. Except for that minor irratant I would most definately stay again and would reccomend to all. Springville, CA"
243,1886,"Jul 25 2006 	not a happy customer.	I had the exact same problem with the hotel that a previous reviewer had. I was sent an e-mail on May 17th for a special that Omni hotels were offering. It was reserve one night get the 2nd night free. I booked it that same evening and was sent a confirmation e-mail immediately with the rate of $230.00 for the first night and $0.00 for the 2nd night. About 2 nights before my scheduled arrival I received a call from someone at the Omni Berkshire confirming my reservation, and I again stated that we had the special rate of one night free and he said ok, but something in his voice seemed suspicious. So the next day I checked my reservation throught the website and it had been changed. It now said $230.00 at two nights with nothing about the second night being free. I was furious and immediately phoned reservations and asked them why my reservation has been changed. She said it was still showing up in her system that my rate was at $230.00 the first night with them 2nd one free. I questioned her on why on my computer the reservations is not showong up like that, and she said that not to worry the reservations always look like that, but in &quot;their&quot; system it shows up as the special rate. I told her about the suspicious phone call I had received the previous day and I told her I really hope when I arrive with my family tomorrow I will not have any hassles about this. She said, &quot;don't worry everything is all set&quot;! We arrived at the hotel the next day and I right away said to the front desk clerk. I am making sure that the rate is correct and we have the 2nd night free. She said &quot;oh no I am sorry we don't know anything about a special that offers one night free&quot;. I luckily had printed every single confirmation and the special offer that I received and showed them to her. She said she didn't think she could do anything about it, but would speak to her manager. We had heard nothing as of 7:00pm that evening, so my husband went down to the front desk and demanded to speak to a manager. She finally came and did appologize and said they would honor the special since we had every copy and proof that we had reserved this special rate. Other issues we had were they did not tell us that their restaraunt was closed due to renovations (they placed a small note in our hotel room). We had arranged late checkout for the day we were leaving, but they failed to tell us that if you stay longer then regular checkout you will be charged an additional $30.00 for valet parking. This was our 2nd time staying at the Omni Berkshire, but unfortunetely it will be our last."
244,1886,"Jul 25 2006 	A Very Special Hotel	This hotel is rapidly becoming one of my favorites in New York.The staff if friendly and helpful, the location is great off MadisonAve. The rooms are very comfortable with great amenities and superior beds and linen. I like the Michangelo and the Rhiga Royal in the city and this property compares well. If you can get a room in in the mid $200's take it ! It requires careful shopping to find it on very limited dates. I am returning last Saturday of July for second stay."
245,1886,"Jul 10 2006	Central location fine hotel	Just back from a 2 night stay at the Omni. This was my second time staying at the hotel and I plan on staying there again in the future.Rooms are of average size but there are no closets. A wardrobe is provided for you to hang your clothes in. The room and furnishings were in good condition and clean.If you join the select guest program, you have the option of choosing up to 2 beverages (hot or cold) to be delivered to your room in the morning, free of charge. This is a more understated hotel which lacks a grand lobby. If you like the sort of hotel that is designed to &quot;impress&quot; you with sensory overload when you walk in the front door, then this may not be the location for you. The main draw of this hotel for me is the central location. Located on 52nd St at Madison Ave, it is close to many things. It is close to Rockefeller Center, restaurants, shopping and about 2 blocks away from several different subway lines."
246,1886,"Jun 8 2006 	Had no complaints	Just returned from a three night stay (June 4 - 7), and unlike some of the other reviewers, had no complaints. Because I booked at the last moment felt as though I'd paid too much for the room (although many other lesser properties - including the the Doubletree Times Square actually - were more expensive for the same time period - there must just have been heavy demand!).I found the staff helpful, the room clean and well appointed (and a big plus were the extra large bath towels!). Had no problem getting quick help to get cabs from the doormen, even in the rain, and everyone was gracious, welcoming and helpful. The workout center was clean and had a reasonable number of cardio machines and free weights (while well used, never crowded when I was there in the morning). They also provide fruit, towels and magazines - more than adequate although not a large space.A few less than positive features - no coffee maker in the room, but as others have said, if you sign up for their frequent guest program (which you can do as you check in) they'll bring up 2 beverages of choice in the morning (coffee, juice, etc.) as well as an extra paper (USA today is always delivered). I found that service to be very prompt each morning. The room service menu is a bit expensive as are the items in the mini bar - but that's the case in most nicer hotels. There are so many choices for dining near-by that are open late, there's not much reason to stay in (for lunch - Europa Cafe is quick and good; for dinner try Fresh Basil's on Lex/56th - just basic, good italian!).I'm in the city regularly on business, and will stay at the Omni in the future - great location, friendly staff, and the rooms/amenities were more than adequate."
247,1886,"Jun 1 2006	Great Hotel Bad Business Practices!	Recieved an email from Omni on May 17 for a special stay one night, get the second night complimentary promotion. The promotion was booked through the Omni website, and I got a confirmation from the Omni Hotel for one night, and the second night complimentary. Called the hotel that night to verify the rate, and was told the rate was good-one night at $287.10 and the second night was complimentary. Called back again on May 21 and spoke with Marisol who again verified the confirmed rate and reservation. Called again on May 25 and spoke with Tony who also verified the confirmed rate and reservation. When I checked in with my family on May 26th, I AGAIN verified the confirmed rate with the clerk who checked us in. He verified the rate of 287.10 for one night with the second night complimentary. We checked in and had a wonderful time in NYC.The morning we checked out, we recieved a bill that charged us 287.10 for EACH night we stayed (we stayed 2 nights). I immediately questioned this with the front desk, who said someone would call me back. No one did, so I went to the front desk, only to be handed off to Chat, the Assistant Front Office Manager. Chat showed me her paperwork which verified the confiirmed rate and complimentary night, but said she needed to check it in the system, which was down. SHe promised to call me on May 31, but didn't. I called her, and she told me she hadn't had a chance to research it yet. I called again June 1 (since the 2 nights has already showed up on my statement), and she referred me to Catherine, the Omni Revenue Officer. Catherine tried to insist I didn't make the reservation through their website, and then tried in say that the front desk clerk told me the 287.10 was for each night. I told her the clerk said no such thing, and that my husband was standing right there and heard it. I also pointed out the 4 times that the confirmed rate and reservations were checked and verified. She said she would get back to me.In short, I feel a bait and switch has occurred here, and I will be taking this up with their coprorate offices. BE AWARE to keep all your copies and makes notes of who you spoke to and when. It may come in handy."
248,1886,"May 24 2006	Great centrally located hotel	Stayed at the Omni Berkshire in mid-town May 19-22 and had NO problems with our stay. From check in to check out, the staff was friendly and courteous. The room was average size for Manhattan but very clean well maintained. The room/maid service was excellent. We used the Concierge many times with excellent suggestions for lunch/dinner. The location between Madison and 5th makes this an excellent loacation if you are traveling for pleasure or biz!! I would definately stay there again. - Eat at the China Grillnear this property - the best in new Chineese!"
249,1886,"May 17 2006 	Disrespected from the moment I checked in. 	I made a reservation on Dec. 10, 2005, for a room in May 2006. Despite confirming four times that I had a room with two double beds they tried to give me a king upon check in. I was with my sister when I checked in so it was obvious why I needed two beds. They said I could have two double beds on the smoking floor, I do not smoke. I persisted and &quot;suddenly something became available.&quot; Yeah, right. My coworker checked in later that night and he was alone and did not request double beds when he made the reservation, but they had no problem giving him two double beds. Hmmm. The room was stinky, like a bad mildew and the concierge would not give me matches to light a small travel candle. While I was talking to the concierge about the smell he started helping another couple who had arrived at the concierge desk after me. I was still talking and he completely ignored me and started talking to someone else. I could not believe it. I also complained about the fact that the hotel's website says all guest rooms have pillow top mattresses, but my room did not. The concierge said someone would get back to me. No one got back to me. I complained again the morning I was to check out and the Manager on Duty tried to blame the missing pillow top on housekeeping. I was there five nights and there are two beds. I highly doubt housekeeping would make the same mistake so many times consecutively in the same room. My room also has trash underneath the beds from a prior guest. I don't expect the room had a complete cleaning for a long time. On top of it all one of the doormen called my sister a ----- and I received a very early morning wake up call that I did not ask for. When I checked out I attempted to get some sort of compensation for all the problems and the hotel told me my travel agent would be in charge of that. I don't see how my travel agent would be in charge of assessing a discount or some sort of compensation like that. The kept saying they were sorry, but it was pretty obvious they cared more about getting as much of my money as possible instead of trying to hang on to a potential return guest. When I left the hotel a doorman, for the first time during my whole stay, tried to help me with my bags and told him not to and he demanded he must put my bags in the car himself because he's union. The doormen were so lazy and crude. Basically the hotels stinks, quite literally. I paid a discount rate of $235 and it wasn't worth it. Go to the Palace or the Regency."
