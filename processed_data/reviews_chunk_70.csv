57,1756,"Oct 7 2007 	clean comfortable convenient	Great experience. I took a red eye flight and the friendly desk clerk arranged early check in. The room was spotless. Small room but usual by NY or European standards. Location was great with uptown and downtown buses one block away. Walk to Times Square and Empire State building. Great Italian deli on 9th ave. Hotel staff printed out my boarding pass on their computer. Desk staff was heard teaching each other French words during the time a large group from France was there, and then I heard them deciding to work on learning a foreign language. These were young people and I was very impressed.For some travelers the desolate block and 7 am to 5 pm construction noise might be a problem. Ask for a room on the 10th or 11 floor it is quieter. I walked home at midnight with no problem, but the block has nothing on it but a 24 hour taxi repair and two huge construction sites. I am a 60 yo woman who is used to urban living."
58,1756,"Oct 1 2007 	Far better than expected!	I was full of anxiety after being awarded this hotel via Priceline and reading the unflattering reviews. From the minute my husband and I arrived however we were greatly relieved. The hotel was clean, the room size was fine (it is Manhattan after all), and the staff was friendly. The hotel is a little off the main thoroughfare, but it was only an easy 10-15 minutes to walk to the subway and it was pretty quiet. The taxi garage across the street was never a problem, if anything there were mechanics working late into the night which made us a little extra safe. Easy to hail a cab close to the hotel. We bid 150.00 a night and probably could have gotten the room cheaper. The city is expensive and it was great having a room this nice for the price."
59,1756,"Sep 6 2007 	More than happy	Simple hotel, a lot complain about the location, but myself and my wife had no troubles with it, enjoyable 4 night stay there before jetting off to SF. Penn station just a 5-10 min walk away made this more than adequate location wise. Room was clean, staff helpful. Recommended."
60,1756,Aug 2 2007	Warning dooon doo itt!!!!	this hotel was the only bad experience when i went to NYthe hotel is terriblethe location is TERRIBLEis sooo far to downtown and we are not the only ones with complainalmost avery guest had the same opinionsand plus around is ery scary at night full of homeless seriously DONT STAY IN THAT HOTELyour gonna regret like usis a warningdont listen to good reviews they totally LIES!!
61,1756,"Jul 25 2007 	Great Location 4 Business at Javits	If youre staying here for business at the Convention Center then you will really like that its a short 1-2 minute walk down the street. The surrounding area does look bad, but I have stayed here for a week four years in a row and I never had any problems. Other than the Convention Center there really isnt much around that area. The hotel and rooms are okay but small in size. Ive only stayed here during trade shows and there rates are very high, but this is NY so I guess thats what they go for."
62,1756,"Jul 18 2007 	Not the Worst	The Hotel was clean, the staff was very helpful and kind. The location is the biggest problem. It is a pretty long, walk to the subway or Times Square. The neighborhood is not the best, but I wouldn't really say it was bad. I don't recommend it for a first timer. We didn't have the noise problem at night but we were on the backside of the building. The rooms are pretty small. But we booked throught Priceline and the price was right."
63,1756,"Jul 13 2007 	Worst Hotel I have ever stayed at!!!!!!!!!!!	This hotel is absolutely awful. Stay at Motel 6 before this place. The previous reviews are very accurate. It is situated on 38th st very close to the convention center. I booked this hotel on priceline for $70/night. This is a great price for NYC and always book with priceline as I have never had a problem with any of the hotels they have given me. I am far from picky.Unlike some guests, I had no problems with the lobby or with check in. Upon going up to our room on the second floor, we were very unimpressed with its condition. The curtains were falling off the hangers and we noticed the main recessed lights was out as well as stale cigarette smoke permeating the room. We called down to the front desk to ask if we could move to another room. They said they had none but did send up an asian man who spoke NO english who handed us a light for a lamp. I said no and pointed to the ceiling and he just left. A few minutes later, he came back with a light (no ladder). Since he was about 5 ft tall, I just took it and changed it myself. The following AM we were introduced to their horrible breakfast. They only have about 10 tables for everyone and served brown bananas (yummy) and stale looking doughnuts as well as plain bagels. They had a limited selection of cereal and only had whole milk?? Who drinks whole milk. I heard one lady ask for some butter for her bagel and one of the workers said they had been out for over a week!That evening, I called down for an extra blanket as my wife was cold. The blanket never came. I also asked for a 7 am wake up call so we could get an early start. The wake up call came the following morning at 7:25 am. 25 minutes late....lucky I didnt have to catch a plane. We didnt oversleep, however, as we had a prompt wake up call from all the banging from the 24 hr cab repair shop just across the street.One night when we were passing by the front desk, we overheard one of the staff who was on her cell phone calling one of her friends a stupid [--]. NICE.Not to mention this hotel is horribly located. They have to be selling drugs out of the 24 hr cab repair place. We also had the pleasure of seeing multiple prostitutes just two blocks away from the hotel on our way back. We felt very unsafe in the area and woud recommend carrying a gun.The only positive aspect of this hotel is the $70/night price. If I had paid what some postings said they paid, I would have demanded a refund and go somewhere else."
64,1756,"Jun 5 2007 	Don't do it	This was by far the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at in my entire life. I walked in and was first greeted with a terribly hot and muggy lobby area, that lacked any a/c whatsoever. My room was on the second floor, and even though I asked for non-smoking and was assured that my request was honored, my entire floor overwhelmingly reaked like stale smoke. I entered my room only to find out that, after I was finished gagging from the odor, that I couldn't walk around without shoes on because the floor was soaked. The curtains were broken off the hooks and wouldn't close all the way, leaving no privacy against the 24-HOUR cab repair shop right across the street, which made loud, obnoxious noises through the entirety of the night. My blow-dryer started sparking profusously after it was on for about two minutes, and smelled like I lit something on fire. The bedspread had cigarette burn-holes on it, and the front desk staff had the knowledge of a door knob and the speed of immobile 90-year-olds. A half a block down the road was a horse and buggy area, which was lovely enough to fill our nostrils with the smell of urine and manure right after they emptied the smoke smell of our hotel room. The location is mildly convenient if you are in the city to go to the convention center, but not convenient to anything else. I didn't feel safe walking around the area during the daytime, and saw two lovely hookers on one of our walks toward Time Square, not to mention other spooky crowds. You are far better off staying somewhere like the Milford Plaza, which is comparitvely priced, and provides a shuttle to the convention center. If you must stay at this absolutely hellish hotel, bring a one-piece body suit, rubber boots, gloves, and a gas mask."
65,1756,"Jun 3 2007	Hated it!!!!!	The location is terrible. Across the street from a 24 hour cab leasing and auto repair shop, down the street from a carriage horse stable (lovely smell of horse urine) and next to noisy train tracks. We `were there May 29 thru June 2 of this year and NYC was very warm. No A/C in the lobby, vending machine out of order as well as lobby ladies' room. Neither bathtub drain in our 2 rooms worked. We requested repair the day we arrived and they were never fixed. We had non-smoking rooms, but corridors smelled of cigarette smoke. A/C units in room were very noisy. Rooms were extremely small. Only a tiny bottle of lotion for an amenity in the bathroom. Had to go to the desk for shampoo. Twice in 1 day our room key had to be re-programmed.Our rooms overlooked a dirty tar roof and the train tracks. Could not call room to room. Continental breakfast was next to nothing...only doughnuts, bagels ,bread and poor cereal selection...no fruit, yogurt or anything healthy.Very bleak, unsafe neighborhood.We did not expect the Taj Mahal, but THEY should have paid US to stay there. Lesson learned...you get what you pay for."
66,1756,"Jun 3 2007 	Hotel Hell	Location and rooms are as described in other reviews: a healthy walk to Times Square and fine, small rooms. In fact, the superb cleaning of the room on a daily basis is the only reason I'm not rating this as terrible. Two of the desk clerks were rude bordering on hostile. We were not told when we checked in of any of the amenities (breakfast, fitness center, internet access) and clerk acted as if we were not welcome. I requested an ethernet cord to connect to my laptop which was provided for a fee which was initially $3.00 but immediately changed to $10.00. The ethernet cable did not work, so I returned it and was refunded my $10; then asked if we could access the internet via wireless and were told to &quot;go ahead.&quot; That didn't work, either, and when the following morning we mentioned this to another desk clerk, he scoffed at us and told us wireless was only available in the lobby. Wish we'd known! I also overheard the desk clerk who checked us in advising another guest of the AM breakfast, but we were never told. We asked about taxi service to JFK for our departure and were told it would be $65 with a $10 deposit, which we paid. After checking around, we found several better deals and cancelled our hotel booked taxi. A third desk clerk, pleasant in other respects, told us our deposit was not refundable. We checked our receipt which stated it was and when we returned to the hotel, showed the receipt to another desk clerk who told us, &quot;Go to your room and I will bring it later!&quot; In addition, the hallways on our floor reeked of marijuana on several occasions. I will never stay at this hotel again. The lower rate is not worth the grief and inconvenience. We felt we were intruders and not welcome guests. Very unpleasant. The room was, however, kept very clean after the first day when we found a wet towl hanging on the bathroom door and hairs on the bed sheets."
67,1756,"May 1 2007 	Decent Place with a Bit of a Hike	I've stayed all around the city in just about every area using Priceline (so you never really know where you will end up). Got a great deal on this place...just for a one night stay. I was going to a concert with a friend (another woman) at MSG so we didn't really care where we were...as long as it was clean and safe. This hotel was both of those. We walked from Grand Central...which is what we always do so we didn't necessarily mind that but I'm sure others would find it to be a hike. As other reviewers said...it is in an industrial area so no little cafe's across the street or anything like that. The front desk clerk told us that they are going to be building up that area soon so that's good to hear. The rooms were small but appeared to be re-done recently. Bedding, bathroom, furnishings etc were all brand new. They seemed to have a nice breakfast but we didn't partake in it. The front desk gal was great. Though we felt safe walking home that night from MSG it was definately a little disconcerting since it was basically dead in that area at that time of night (11pm). If you don't mind walking and want a deal..give it a try. Oh yeah and on Saturday and Sunday there is a flea market in the street about a block up..if that is your thing...check it out."
68,1756,"Mar 20 2007 	Not to Worry	Stayed at this hotel on March 17 with 2 other couples for one night. Hotel is off the beaten path in the middle of a somewhat industrial area, but we had no problems with the location. If you don't mind walking (which it seems your always going to walk in NYC anyway), this was a good location. We actually walked from Grand Central to the hotel (about a 1/2 hour walk) in slushy weather, but we braved it! We met more friends from London at Time's Square which probably took us about 10 minutes to walk to and partied at local Irish Pub's on 9th Street/Ave? which seemed to be less crowded than your Time's Square area (and cheaper). Felt safe walking in the area at night - there are a few late night/quick bite places nearby (hot dogs/pizza) on 9th.Room was yes, small, but very clean and we had no problems with the room at all. We tried to check in earlier than the 3:00 p.m. check-in, but that didn't happen, but when we returned, we got our rooms and were not disappointed with them (all 3 sets of us).The continental breakfast was acceptable - cereals, bagels, croissant's, fruit, coffee, tea, juices, donuts - it did us just fine for a quick bite before we left.Hey, while it's not the RITZ, we didn't pay for the Ritz ...but for the money we paid, I would definately stay at this location again if I got the same prices. Don't worry, you'll be fine as long as you are able to walk, are open-minded and are not expecting an extravagent place. Have fun!"
69,1756,"Mar 13 2007	Quaint but very very nice	Some friends and I ventured up to New York for the Big East Basketball Tournament. I booked this hotel through a 'name your own price' link on [----], so I was not sure what I was getting prior to booking it. My offer price was $100 and it was accepted for a three night stay at the Best Western Convention Center Hotel. At first I was nervous because of the location and the reviews I had read about this hotel. The reviews I read do not do this hotel justice. First of all, the location is great if you don't mind walking a bit. It is true that there are not a lot of restaurants or bars directly in the area, but a five to ten minute walk remedies that. The garage across the road is a bit of an eyesore, but the noise from it was minimal. At no time did we feel unsafe walking around the area. They validate parking at a cost of $21 a day (that's phenomenal) at a lot about 5 minutes from the hotel. The staff was extremely cordial and accomodating (we needed to switch rooms after one night, and this was done no problem); the rooms although small, were clean and very nice, and the CONTINENTAL breakfast was decent and very substantial. We had a great stay at this hotel making our New York trip outstanding. It's about a 10 minute walk from the Garden and Times Square. Great Trip. Great Hotel."
70,1756,"Mar 2 2007 	Good deal~	My husband took bar exam in Jacob Javis Convention Center so I booked this hotel as it's the closest one.  The price is about 199.99/per night (excludes tax). This price for a NY hotel, we don't complain about it.  The room is very small but the size of bathroom is ok. It's clean and has everything we need. They offer free internet, that's a big plus for us.  The staff is very friendly. You need any kind of help, they will do their best.  The area is safe for me. I often walk around by myself as my husband had to concentrate on the exam, but I went back to the hotel before the sunset. After 7pm, the stree gets quiet. I would suggest not to walk around alone.  It takes 15-20 minutes walk to Time Square or NY Penn Station. There are several starbucks &amp; a supermarket on 42nd stree. You can also find several restaurants around the corner of 42nd St. &amp; 10th Ave.  If you don't care about small room &amp; a little bit walk, it's a great choice."
71,1756,"Jan 5 2007 	Great Deal	Stayed for 5 nights the week before Christmas. Paid $116 a night for a queen bed. Had a pleasent stay here. Place is not in a tourist area but we felt completely safe walking in the area. (We being two girls) It is at least a ten minute walk to subway but we were able to walk to quiet a few things, like...time square, madison square garden, macy's, empire state building, port were harbor tours begin, and the theatre district. The room was clean and the staff was friendly. Only made it to breakfast one morning which was not that great but better then nothing. Could not hear the car repair down stairs. We stayed on 9th floor."
72,1756,"Nov 17 2006 	Fine and 'cheap'	This hotel was fine and 'cheap' for NYC. I paid $214/weeknight plus tax, but most other hotels on short notice booking were running above $300. It is 3 or 4 long 'avenue blocks' west of 7th and 8th avenue, but really only a 15 min walk to Times Sq (north) or to Penn Station (south). Hotel was built 3 years ago, so rooms are new and clean. Bed sheets are a bit cheap, but very clean and no real complaints here. Location is a bit odd, sharing block with taxi repair garage, horse barn, and gentlemen's club, but it is safe and no worries for all but a nervous solo pedestrian after midnight who might take a cab rather than walk the last few blocks (though I never had a problem or felt that necessary). Rooms have granite floor in bathroom, coffee makers, and safes. The windows tilt open which is a bonus. It's an 11 or so story building, with something like 60 rooms is my guess. Front desk is friendly. They take left luggage after check out cheerfully if you have time to explore and want to do that. Check out is noon, but they added an hour and a half (130) on my request with no extra charge. For the Convention Center, location would be superb. Continental breakfast is skimpy, but it is free coffee and a bad bagel so hard to complain too much. Overall, a fine 'cheap' alternative if you cannot find similarly priced accommodations in an updated hotel closer to wherever you are going in NYC."
73,1756,"Nov 8 2006 	Very average	This hotel is fine for people on a budget! Our room was very small and dated, but adequate. Absolutely everything at breakfast was plastic (including the bagels I think!) and they didn't have sufficient seating.The area was okay - quite convenient for getting around, but didn't have a very nice feel to it in my opinion. It's surrounded by car washes. Saying that though it was great being able to walk to Times Square within 10 mins..."
74,1756,"Sep 17 2006 	Surprised!	When I first saw this hotel I thought I'd made a mistake by choosing it, but when I arrived I changed my mind. The staff were friendly and efficient, the rooms were small but clean and comfortable. It's a few blocks away from the shopping and sights but once you find your feet your fine. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but they allowed us to order in food, they had a few menu's in the rooms. Breakfasts were basic - cereals and toast.Avoid using the phone in the room, the charges are absoloutly dismal - especially when they have payphones all over the city (if you can get them to work that is)!!Overall I can't think of any reason why you shouldn't stay here!"
75,1756,"Sep 7 2006 	Awesome Hotel!	Stayed at the hotel in march, kept a fairly open mind about the place. my room was great, cleaned everyday(if you wanted it) at a very good standard, staff were great, location was pretty poo but nothing but a short taxi ride couldn't sort out.I was a alone female travelling and the staff made me feel really welcome, felt very safe in the surrounding areas at night on my own.WOULD RECOMMEND!!!"
76,1756,"Aug 12 2006	Surprisingly comfortable!	This hotel was a great deal for the price. I used it when I was taking the bar exam at the Javits Center, and I could not have asked for anything more. The room was quiet and clean, and the staff was very accommodating and helpful.The hotel is the closest you can find to the Javits Center, so if you are having a conference there, this is a great option. There is a free continental breakfast which starts at 7am, but if you have to get up before then, your options are very limited (you have to order from a 24 hour diner - the hotel provides menus for you).One of the few drawbacks is that the block itself is very very quiet. There is a cab repair place right across the street, so finding a cab typically isn't too much of an issue. But at night (say, past 7pm) there is virtually nobody in the area, which is a problem if you are planning on hitting any bars late at night by yourself. There is also a horse stable on the block, which makes the area a little smelly, and there is constantly hay blowing around. Also, there is a &quot;gentleman's cabaret&quot; on the block.In summary, the area is not the greatest, but it is extremely convenient to the Javits Center and a good value. I had a very comfortable stay during a stressful period."
77,1756,"Jun 7 2006	don't stay on the third floor	The hotel is across the sfreet from a car repair service that's open 24/7. You can hear hammering in the middle of the night. I was on the third floor facing 38th street. It was memorial day weekend and the hotel was full or we would have asked for another room. Other than that, the room was clean and the employees were very pleasant."
78,1756,"Jun 5 2006	Very Clean for a budget hotel	We were up in New York for my sisters graduation and decided to make a vacation out of it by staying in the city for 5 nights. The hotel was very clean and cozy and had all the necessities. Though I had reservation at first because it was a bit far on the west side, we stuck to it because it was the only reasonably priced hotel during the third week in May. The bed was a bit hard for my taste and the blankets were to thin. Other than that, no complains about the hotel. However, the location is not exactly prime. Its located in Hell Kitchen, which is an equivalent to your local ghetto neighborhood. The closes subway station is 2 avenue blocks away (if youve been to New York, you know how long the avenue blocks are). The minute you walk out of the hotel, you smell horse manure because right next door is a stable and right next to that, a gentlemens club. So, for all the money we spent on tax cabs, we could have stayed in Times Square because we were average $50 in cab money a day. Nonetheless, the hotel was very clean and that's the most important of all."
79,1756,"Apr 11 2006	cheap and cheerful	We stayed in the hotel between the 8th and 11th of december 2005. We had spent ages searching for hotels and as we had left it to the last min we found that the majority of places were either booked up or very expensive. But then we found the best western convention centre! When we arrived I was a little unsure about the location - especially walking back to the hotel on our first night - but we had no problems at all! It's only a short walk from times square! All the staff in the hotel are very friendly. The rooms are very small but well equipped and very clean. The continental breakfast is great, it really does set you up for the day! As two young women on a shopoping trip the hotel was perfect! i'd definately recomend it to people!"
80,1756,"Apr 8 2006	Great Hotel if your on a budget	Stayed at this hotel for a week in march there is not much around but it is only a short walk from Times square and 34th street.Rooms where nice,clean and comfortable Tony the door man was really nice and helpful would stay here again if on a budget."
81,1756,"Apr 8 2006	Great Little Hotel	Stayed here for 7 nights during March and April and would recommend it for a bargain break in New York.Hotel is spotlessly clean and the Staff are friendly and welcoming. Rooms are a bit on the small side but nicely decorated and furnished. I was a bit worried about the location when I first arrived but it is only a short walk to civilisation and restaurants, and I experienced no problems. Perhaps would not recommend for a lone woman Traveller due to location, would have no problems during the day but might feal uneasy at night. Would stay here again without hesitation, can't beat it for value and cleanliness, New York can be a bit of a lottery where hotels are concerned, unless you can afford the very best."
82,1756,Mar 23 2006	Ideal Hotel	I stayed in this hotel for a week in March. At first the location seemed to be dodgy but was actually safe. There isnt much in the immediate location but a few blocks away on 9th avenue there is numerous diners and restuarants. The hotel is within walking distance of Times Square and 34th street which is good for shopping. The hotel room was small but very clean which is the main thing for me! The breakfast sets you up for the day. As I was on the 6th floor I didnt hear any noise from traffic. Would definately recommend staying here.
83,1756,Mar 4 2006	Close to Amtrak	Nice hotel convenient to Penn station
84,1756,"Dec 1 2005	Felt Safe but just the basics	I stayed at this Best Western because I read the reviews of the BW President, which were not very good. I really rely on Tripadvisor for the truth. Location was probably the biggest downfall, but it is in Manhattan! This hotel felt safe because it was near the NYPD. In the middle of the night we heard bullhorns pulling over cars. Although it is a bit of a walk to activities aside from the Convention Center, it was adequate for one night. The staff were very nice and the continental breakfast was adequate. It is best to walk towards the Convention Center and then take a right for night time walks. That way you walk by NYPD, which is more than safe. Walk up to 42nd St. and turn right. There was a great restaurant along the way called Cafe Josephine. As you walk up 42nd St. it starts to light up. The room we had was small but clean. No frills. I would stay here again if I had to go to the Convention Center, which is right across the street. The price was right at around $200 night during Thanksgiving weekend."
85,1756,"Nov 18 2005 	Did Not Like It!	I stayed at this hotel because of the reviews and because I had to go to a conference at the convention center. I left after two days because I did not feel safe. I'm a woman traveling alone and did not like the characters going in and out of the &quot;gentleman's club&quot; down the block or the taxi drivers hanging out all night long across the street. There was even a fight between some of them late one night that got loud and scary! Yelling, swearing, etc. I was too scared to go out at night to get dinner so didn't even eat. There are homeless people and thugs on the streets. The rooms are small, but clean. The staff was helpful. The location is awful. I moved to Times Square and was much happier."
86,1756,Nov 14 2005	Modest but marvelous	What a hidden gem... ok its not the Waldorf but it is clean and friendly. Breakfast is complimentary and the bagels are fresh!! Endless tea and coffee too .. This hotel is about 15 to 20 mins walking (stroll) distance from Times Square. At no point either in the hotel or walking back at night to the hotel did we feel uneasy. The area is busy but quiet and all the main streets leading to the sights etc are lit up so it feels very safe to walk about. Rooms are smallish but well equipped and with friendly daily maid service they are just perfect for a short stay in NYC.Try and get a room on the 11th floor its quiet up there and the views aren't too bad either.This is a great hotel and if you can get over the 15 mins stroll in to town then its well worth the stay.
87,1756,"Sep 21 2005	Great Hotel	The staff was great...very helpful and courteous. The room was always clean and it wasn't as small as some other NY hotels. Breakfast was OK, with coffee, juices, and breads. Although the hotel is located on a street among garages and a few blocks from Times Square, I felt safe and I would stay here again for the price."
88,1756,"Sep 6 2005	A great hotel	Stayed there September, the rooms were spotless and well cleaned. The staff were very friendly and helpful.Breakfast was A1 and plenty of machines for late night snacks.The hotel is situated in a quiet part of town , even with the taxi repair shop / fire house nearby, much quieter than hotels I have stayed at in 34th Street.Only a short walk to the centre and ideal for attractions like the Circle Line/ US Intrepid.It did what it says on the tin ......."
89,1756,"Aug 28 2005	Bargain	I booked this hotel last minute as my first choice hotel was not available for the entire stay. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I was expecting an average hotel in an iffy area but was very pleasantly suprised.Most importantly the hotel, our bedroom and bathroom were immaculately clean. The rooms weren't overly big, but not so small that we were uncomfortable. We were on the 11th floor and had a view of the Hudson from our room which was nice. Breakfast was complimentary and buffet style - Cereal, Toast, Juices, Tea &amp; Coffee, Fruit, Bagels, Doughnuts.The hotel is on 38th Street between 10th and 11th Avenue and is located amongst numerous 24 hour taxi repair garages. This means that there are constantly people around and I felt completely safe walking to and from the hotel at night. Although there is not much to do or see in the immediate vicinity of the hotel it's an ideal base for sightseeing. A 10 minute walk in either direction will take you to the nearest Metro Stations at Penn Station / Port Authority Bus Terminal where there are also plenty of shops and restaurants. A 15-20 minute walk will get you to the Empire State Building and it's also a similar distance to Times Square. I saw some horses near to the hotel on my final day, however I did not notice any poo smells as reported by other Tripadvisor users!"
90,1756,"Aug 23 2005	It's a yes well worth it!!!!	This is my second time in NYC and the first time I stayed in a 4**** hotel in front of central park for double the price. The walk to time square is about the same but the rooms here are without a doubt much more recent. The airconditioners are new, the water pressure and temperature are 10 on 10. The drawback is the 24 hours bodyshop in front of the hotel and you don't feel like a million bucks coming out the hotel. The area is not like central park but for the price, any day for me. You also get parking for 21$ a day 25$ for van or 4X4 but I negociated for 21$ a day for my 4X4. Also, internet access is free, a continental breakfast is included (toast, cereal, pastery) and the service is excellent. Hope this helps you in your choice."
91,1756,"Jul 29 2005	What a jewel !	Ok so this hotel is on W38th between 10th &amp; 11th avenue and yes its about a 20 min walk to shopping and sightseeing areas but I LOVED this place.In fact I am organising my next NYC break and this is where I'm going to stay.Clean rooms with very clean bathroom (a big factor for me), and nicely sized, very friendly staff, lovely complimentary breakfasts.My cousin stayed at the Pennslyvannia on 34th &amp; 7th and it was such a pit, gross bathroom and such small rooms you knock things over.This hotel is such a great find, hidden away but well worth the price.You must be prepared to walk, which frankly is the best way to see NYC.Its not far from Penn Station which has links to the Long Island Rail Road from JFK's Airtrain station Jamaica Center. 30mins from leaving the airport I was in Manhattan and less than hour from leaving the airport I had checked in to my room.Try this place, you won't regret it."
92,1756,May 23 2005	Best Western was nice	The Best Western by Javits Convention Center was very clean and comfortable. It is just around the corner from the covention center so it's very convenience for those attending trade shows. The employees were very friendly. They serve continental breakfast every morning and also have free internet access via ethernet which they will provide if you forget yours.
93,1756,"May 12 2005	A pleasant suprise!	My partner and I have just returned from 5 days at the Best Western Convention Center Hotel and I must say im impressed. The room was spotlessly clean and the size was accepatable. The staff were friendly and the cleaners always greeted us with a smile. Breakfast consisted of bagels, muffins, doughnuts, toast, cereal, juices and tea/coffee. I thought the hotel was located in an ok area, at no point did I feel unsafe, and it was only half a mile from time square!! My only gripe? The hallway outside our room smelled quite strongly of smoke."
94,1756,"Apr 23 2005	fair deal clean and new	close enough to walk everywhere in midtown. I traveled with a nine year old and we were able to get around easily on foot.staff was helpful and polite.... room was newer, neat and clean although seemed small... but I stayed at the Hilton before and the room wasn't much bigger and was at least three times the price.They checked our bags and held them after check-out until we were ready to leave. The hotel staff greeted us each time we entered and left and appeared to know that we belonged at the hotelthere was plenty of food at the free continential breakfast as well as a large, comfortable area to eat....food was replenished as needed and the staff was attentive to the buffet arearecommend it for a short stay in the Times Square area"
95,1756,"Apr 11 2005 	very impressed	I was very surprised and impressed by our stay at Best Western Convention Center Hotel. It was a little out of the way, but in NYC you must get used to walking anywhere you go. I do not think there is a place in NY that has an &quot;ideal&quot; location. The only complaint I could find was that the rooms were extremely small. Of course, you are only staying there to sleep, so that shouldn't matter. It was clean, the beds were so comfortable, the maid came every day to clean up and give fresh towels. The staff was friendly and outgoing. I highly recommend this place. Yes, it might smell a little like horse poop outside, but you can get used to it. Plus, when are you going to be standing outside anyways. I suggest seeing the firestation right up the road where there are some cute, outgoing firemen. So, if you are looking for a nice, clean, good price hotel...stay at the Best Western Convention Center."
96,1756,Feb 7 2005	Good clean friendly hotel	I booked the hotel for a shopping trip to NYC after reading the reviews on this site. The hotel was basic but a really good base for exploring New York. It IS in a good location if you don't mind a walking! A cab garage is near by so it was v.easy to hail one if needed. We felt that the area was safe if you were sensible and we walked back every night. (There were 4 of us). Our only complaint is that the breakfast area is far too small and the queues for a coffee in the morning were silly! It wasn't worth waiting for when Times Sq is a couple of blocks away or you could get a good cuppa from the deli on the corner.

1,1762,A Cheap Break	Stayed here for 2 night using some of my points.Yes it is off the beaten track a little but no more than a five minute walk to Times Square and all the hussle and bussle you will need.I would say this is an up and coming area not a run down area as there was construction going on and I did not hear anything throughout the night and cannot comment on the day as we were out. We were on the 31st floor with a great view of the Empire State building and of the Hudson River. Friendly staff that gave good information regarding local services and also organised our return taxi to the airport.We did not feel frightened going out of the hotel anytime of the day and the roads are well lite at night and the hotel is only a couple of hundred yards from the main 8th avenue.I would recommend this hotel on a budget as it is fairly new everything is clean and tidy there is a small kitchen in the room if you want to bring your own food back to cook
2,1762,"Nice Hotel..Not so nice neighborhood	My wife and I stayed for the weekend and found this hotel well located, but many constructions surrounding the area makes it noisy day and night. Did not know was a long-stay hotel meaning our rooms were not done until we were out."
3,1762,"Nov 24 2009 	Adequate...but ""Times Square"" location misleading	Stayed here on Priority Points but would question whether I would pay for this property. For budget conscious travellers, its perfectly adequate. In fact, the new rooms are crisp and clean although I did find some hot water problems and a bathroom basin that was pretty clogged. Room size is compact but better than some more expensive hotels. Main issue here is the location - pretty uninspiring and a little too far away from Times Square to be considered a &quot;Times Square&quot; hotel. The misleading title is compounded by the very shady and uninspiring 9th Avenue which is the closest 'main drag' to the hotel. For this reason alone, I would think twice about paying for a room here. The second reason I would be hesitant to return is the lack of room service (cleaning/beds). If I am paying around $180 for this room, I would expect my room to be serviced daily rather than the weekly arrangement. With few breakfast options on the block, you are better off staying at the Holiday Inn Express next door for a few bucks more. However, the room had a lovely flat-screen TV (and DVD), fast &amp; free internet, great microwave and a full-size refrigerator which might be great for long-stay guests but superfluous for short stay vacationers. Overall, the location &amp; misleading name of the hotel puts me off staying here again. For a little extra, there are better bets."
4,1762,"Nov 16 2009 	Very Enjoyable and Nice Staff	I am all about reviews so I will try my best. The hotel is brand new, so it is definently different from hotels in New York for hotels in this price range. I personally felt very comfortable walking around. Time Square is a less than 5 min walk. Madison Square Gardens 5-7min walk. Hotel staff was very nice and accomadating. They held our luggage for the entire day after we checked out. Rooms were average size with a full kitchen. Bathroom was clean. Bed was very comfortable and there was a 42&quot; flat screen tv. I personally thought this was a great place to stay for those with a budget. Close to Times Square, Subway, yet just enough away from the noise. There is a great place on the corner of 39th and 8th that serves breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Hope these reviews helped."
5,1762,"Nov 7 2009 	Great Stay	Stayed for two nights for a leisure trip to NY. The hotel is brand new and looks the part. The rooms were clean and well equipped. While the rooms are not large you don't feel trapped in the room due to the nice layout. Having the full size fridge was handy. The rooms have a 42&quot; TV that offered some HD Channels which was great. We arrived early in the morning, and unfortunately the hotel would not allow us to check-in until the mid afternoon which was a minor disappointment but they did stow our bags for us.The location is convenient as the Subway is very close by and and close to Times Square. The neighborhood where the hotel sits is not glamorous - but I didn't feel unsafe returning late at night.I would return to this hotel in the future."
6,1762,"Nov 1 2009 	Pleasantly surprised but don't walk late at night near Port Authority	I usually go above a 2** hotel and was wary of staying near Times Square at one... However, I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness, amenities (full kitchen!) and size of the room (not big, but hey, it's New York). Everything was fresh and seemed new and it wasn't noisy.  However, I was scared walking from a show down Ninth Avenue when I got to 41st street...there were lots of very sad looking people hanging out and that plus rowdy bars nearby made me wish I had walked down Eigth Avenue instead."
7,1762,"Oct 31 2009 	Has the potential to be very good - not there yet.	This hotel is 4 blocks from Port Authority or 6 blocks from Times Square. It's in the up-and-coming Fashion District outskirts, and felt safe. The Candlewood Suites sit between the Holiday Inn Express and the Hampton Inn. 32 stories with only 6 rooms to a floor.Pros:* The rooms themselves are lovely. They are little studio suites with a mini-kitchen (full sized fridge). The decor is cozy and beautiful.* Nice workout room. It's in the basement, but fully equipped.* Free laundry room. Great touch! Provide your own soap, but the new washers and dryers are without charge.* Very quiet rooms. We didn't hear a peep from other guests the whole time.* Fast elevators. Two elevators that go from 1st to 32nd floor in about 10 seconds.* Price. For the area, this is pretty reasonable. Cons:* The staff - With the exceptions of Jamie and Kenyetta who were wonderfully attentive and helpful, the staff seemed mostly annoyed with the requests of the hotel guests. Night staff was considerably better than the day crew, but I can only surmise that this is the &quot;trainer&quot; hotel for the other two. It's not the place to go if you're looking for top-notch service (the HIE next door, however, has amazing staff!).* No business center - It's advertised on their site as having one, but there isn't any. You can go next door and use theirs, but it's only 2 and there is always a line.* No breakfast - Again, you can go next door to their buffet (sensing a pattern here?).* The common areas - Simply put, they lack any semblance of luxury. This feels much more like an apartment lobby than a hotel. The staff's work area is open to view, the carpets in the halls look old, and the lobby lacks any sense of warmth.* Hot water - At night, it takes about ten minutes for the shower water to heat up. We didn't seem to have that problem in the morning, though.Overall, if price is your main concern, this is a decent hotel for the location and the money. If you can afford the extra few dollars, I'd stay at the Holiday Inn Express next door. If money is no object, you can't beat the Marriott Marquis for Times Square.Great little Mexican take-out across the street (Fresco Tacos)"
8,1762,"Oct 24 2009 	Not happy!!	We booked this hotel earlier in the year, long before it was open, when the IHG website offered accomodation for four adults in a suite with separate bedroom and pull out sleeper sofa. My daughter and son-in-law who are based in England, decided to join us in New York before we departed on a cruise and the suite seemed a good idea to keep the cost down and enable us to spend time together.When checking that the hotel actually had opened, I was alarmed to read on its website that there was a maximum of two persons to a room. I contacted the central booking service, by phone and internet and was assured that the hotel could provide the accomodation as booked. but my emails to the hotel manager were repeatedly unanswered. Then two days before we were leaving Australia, to travel to New York via Vancouver, my daughter rang the hotel and was told that there were no rooms holding more than two people. She then sent an urgent email to the manager and I contacted our local IHG office. A very polite person rang me from the US to assure me that the hotel did in fact offer the suite for four adults. Then the manager emailed that he was ungrading us to a suite, evidently oblivious to the fact that that was what we had booked in the first place.Daughter and son-in-law arrived before us and sent us a text that the suite was as requested. When we arrived we saw that the living area was tiny but it was not until bed-time that it was discovered that the pull out sofa bed was actually a slightly larger than single size bed. So my son-in-law slept on sofa cushions on the floor. I suppose we should have made a complaint then and there, but we had wasted so much time on the matter and so wanted to spend some rare time together that we let it go.Obviously there have been issues with the central site, which I have read about in regard to other Candlewood Suites, but the response of the hotel manager was very disappointing, to say the least.I have use IHG hotels in Africa, Europe, Australia and Nth America before and this is first negative experience I have had with bookings.The hotel itself is very ordinary; the rooms are dark, the furniture unappealing. By far the worst experience of our six week trip which involved staying in 15 different places."
9,1762,"Oct 20 2009 	Decent but unspectacular hotel close to everything	More of a &quot;long stay&quot; hotel. All rooms are suites - full kitchen. Decent size room for 1 person includes working desk and chairs. Small bathroom, good shower. No turn down or maid service - only every 7 days apparently. Front staff was friendly-ish if only mildly interested. Nothing particularly wrong with this Hotel but nothing that screams fantastic either. Located on 39th in between 7th and 8th which has a sketchy vibe but i had no problems at any time of day. Short few block walk to the Javitz Centre or Times Square. I'll give them much credit for free in-room wireless, especially if you are there on business. Decent rates for Manhattan - they do offer a 'friends and family' rate which helps."
10,1762,"Oct 20 2009 	Worst service ever.	I stayed there for a whole month. They forgot to clean my room twice (cleaning service is once a week so out of 4 times, I only got my room cleaned 2 times) and when I told the cleaning manager about this, she said it was my fault cause if at 4pm it hasn't been cleaned it was my responsability to ask for it.. ?!?!?!Plus, the frontdesk staff is rude and not responsible. I had some important papers they were supposed to send me since it arrived to the hotel after the estimated time and I wasn't there anymore. It's been a month and they haven't send them.I have stayed before in some extended stay hotels. I know the treatment isn't the same as in one of short stays. But it never had been this bad."
11,1762,"Oct 14 2009 	Disappointing experience	I recently stayed at this location in NYC and was extremely disappointed! When I arrived at my room, I found one of the bed pillows covered with blood stains! It was disgusting! Of course, the hotel immediately sent another pillow up after I complained, but that first impression was not a good one. The room was very cold and the heat did not work. The front desk had to send an engineer to my room to get the heat going. This took quite some time and I was exhausted from travel and wanted to relax, but was unable to until later in the evening. There is no ice machine in the hotel...I had to go to the hotel next door to get a bag of ice!!! No business center either!!! The rooms are not as pictured on the website...very disappointing!!! Would not stay here again."
12,1762,"Oct 12 2009 	Clean and cheap close to Times Square	I just spent 6 nights with my girlfriend in this hotel, which is really close to Times Square (5 minutes walking), so the location is very convenient. The hotel is close to the Bus station (Port Authority) but we never felt that the area was unsafe (from what I have read on the internet before the trip, the bus station used to be unsafe several years ago, but now it is ok: after the trip I can confirm this), there is always a lot of people during the day and in the evening it was ok too (even though we never got home later than midnight). The hotel seems quite new (e.g. the elevators are very fast, everything in the room seems new, etc.).Our Queen Bed suite was relatively spacious (I have read many reviews on terribly narrow rooms in other hotels near Times Square so I was actually expecting a smaller room, and instead I was positively surprised by this hotel), the bed allowed us (we were two) to sleep very comportably, there was plenty of space. A private bathroom is included in the room (this is not clear from the website, so this was another pleasent surprise since shared bathroom are common in NYC), and it was very clean, as the room was. Room cleaning takes place once per week, but you can ask the reception for new towels etc if you need them before one week. The kitchen in the room is very useful if you do not want to spend a lot in restaurants or to eat fast-food junk food each and every day, or if you want to have breakfast in your room. The sports room in the cellar is not big but there are several machines. The staff is very young, and they were friendly and helpful (e.g. they advised us about a cheap shuttle to get to the airport, or about a supermarket for buying food; also, after we arrived we noticed we had a lamp which was not working in our suite and it was changed 5 minutes after we informed the staff about it).We booked this hotel two weeks before our travel, so maybe there were not many hotels left, but this was indeed the one with the lowest price among those with non-negative reviews ton the internet. So the quality-price ratio is very high, and moreover I can say that the quality is nice too. Overall, I can summarize this hotel as clean, conveniently located, cheap, with helpful staff and nice rooms. I would indeed choose it again."
13,1762,"Oct 11 2009 	A Gem!	I spent 3 nights in the Candlewood Suites Times Square last week and was very pleasantly surprised.It appears to be brand new, only a few months old. This is obviously a great start since it hasn't had time to get dirty or run down yet like many other Candlewood Suites type hotels tend to get. Actually, its sandwiched between a Holiday Inn Express and a Hampton Inn which appear to have been all built together, all part of the same structure. As far as the location is concerned, its not a very attractive area, but its extremely convenient lying on 39th St between 8th and 9th Avenues. That puts it right by the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and only a few blocks away (5-10 minutes walk) from Times Square. There are PLENTY of restaurants, bars etc. in the area, but then again this is Manhattan. Being a Candlewood Suites, this is not a fancy hotel. The lobby is tiny, it has no restaurant or bar of its own, etc. Also take into consideration that it doesn't have daily maid service. They will clean your room once a week, but the rest of the time its up to you to keep your room tidy. So if you're looking to spoil yourself , forget it. On the other hand, the room itself is extremely comfortable and well appointed. Its not a huge room (reminder this is NY) but its not tiny either. It has a Queensize bed (very comfortable), a reclining chair, a full sized desk with a comfortable office chair and a second chair (since it doubles as an eating area), a small but well equipped kitchen with full size refrigerator, microwave, coffee machine, etc. etc. There is a 32&quot; LCD flat panel TV, and a DVD player. The bathroom has a small bath/shower. Quite frankly, I felt like I had my own little place in Mahattan for a few days. BEST FEATURE was free, all you can eat wireless internet! This is is worth an extra $15-20 per night. There is also DIY laundry facilities and a gym on the premises.I was staying here on points (an incredible deal of 10000 Priority Club points plus $30 per night, they also offer it for 5000 points plus $60 per night) but as far as I can tell the hotel is available for as little as $225 - $250 per night which is very cheap in NY for this standard of hotel.The Candlewood Suites Times Square is great value, whether you are in NY on business or for leisure. Warmly recommended."
14,1762,"Sep 24 2009 	Candlewood Suites is a great choice in NYC	I just completed a seven-night stay at the Candlewood Suites on 39th Street between 8th and 9th Avenue in NYC. The hotel is more or less equidistant between the Port Authority bus terminal and Penn Station, where you can get busses and trains to numerous locations and also catch the subway around Manhattan. This is not a pretty or picturesque neighborhood but it did not feel unsafe. The hotel is a high rise sandwiched between two other hotels. The entire facility is brand new. The suites are like small efficiency apartments, complete with a full size refrigerator, two burner electric stove, dishwasher, sink, dishes, utensils, cook pots, coffee maker, etc. The bed in my Queen suite was extremely comfortable, with very nice sheets, pillows and blankets. The bathroom was clean and included a bath/shower, plenty of towels, etc.I asked for a quiet room and got one on the corner of the 15th floor, just to the left of the elevator. My view consisted of a building across the way under construction but there was no noise to speak of and I slept well each night. The air conditioner was a wall unit that worked adequately and was not too noisy. I would have liked it a bit cooler but few people probably like a room as cold as I do.My favorite sandwich place in the world -- Manganaro's Hero Boy -- is only a few blocks away on 36th Street and 9th Avenue. Try the eggplant parmiagana. DON'T go to the Manganaro's deli next door. The food is terrible and over-priced.The front desk people were young, friendly and helpful. Another big plus is a free laundry downstairs. The front desk provides free laundry soap. There's also a bunch of workout machines in a small but serviceable workout room.On the last three days of my stay, one of the two elevators was out of service. Not that big a problem though, since the elevators are VERY fast and the resulting wait was not too long.All in all, this is a great place to stay. I paid $250/night and found nothing comparable in price or quality. If you can get it cheaper, this is a real find."
15,1762,"Sep 19 2009 	Don't expect a full-on suite	I booked this hotel because I thought I was going to get a suite . . . you know, the kind with a living room and kitchenette. Upon checking into the room, I disappointedly realized that this 'suite' at Candlewood Suites (an all-suite property) was not what I was expecting.Now I understand that this is Manhattan and near Times Square (really though, it's by Port Authority), so I wasn't expecting a full-on suite. However, the total area of the 'suite' was less than most standard rooms I've stayed in before when visiting Manhattan. On the plus side though, the hotel is new. This is a huge plus, considering many hotels in NYC are old, dirty, and just plain tired. This one had nice new furniture, a great bed, and clean everything. The kitchenette was fully stocked with everything you might need, including kitchen rags and pots/pans/silverware. Overall a decent stay after the initial shock of the small 'suite' wore off, but I'd change the brand name to Candlewood Closets."
16,1762,"Sep 11 2009 	Nice new hotel	Stayed in this hotel on 9/6 for one night. This is a brand new hotel. The staffs are helpful and courteous. The suite room is spacious and kitchen is well equipped. It is so new so cleanness is no issue. Subway entrance is at 8th Ave and 40th St but I admit you actually are walking two blocks underground to get to the platforms. So this location should be called &quot;Times Square South&quot; rather. The 39th Street itself can make first time New York visitor nervous so you may consider taking the cab if you plan to come back late at night. What I did was to walk thru the Port Authority bus terminal where police officers were everywhere, to 9th Avenue and then enter 39th St from that end. This hotel is very close to corner of 9th Ave and 39th St and you should feel safe to walk that very short distance. Overall this is a good hotel."
17,1762,Aug 31 2009 	Good Value not convienent location	This was a nice hotel because it was brand new. The location is OK if you have been to NYC and don't mind walking a 5 blocks to subway to get back to the east side of the city. Not as convienent as staying in Midtown with the subway trains lines. The kitchen was a waste of space no one cooks in NYC especially tourists! :-)
18,1762,"Aug 25 2009 	Not Impressed	This is a brand new hotel but needs the finishing touches. Billiing it as &quot;Times Square&quot; hotel is pushing the limits. It's between 8th and 9th on 39th. Upon entering it's obvious the place is new and you would think the staff would be pleasant and helpful and the roms would be perfect. Guess again. The front desk staff was either ignorant or just plain unwilling to be helpful. When booking the room I failed to notice there was only valet parking for $55.00 (expensive even for NYC). so I asked what other options there were. After a 5 second dumb stare she she said the valet parking or I could park on the street. I again asked what other options there were, she had no idea. Turns out there is parking across the street and another place 4 buildings back. Upon arriving in the room it was clean and neat. The bed was comfortable, as were the pillows. However, upon closer inspection you'll notice trhe trim work isn't done around the windows, the fridge barely kept food cold and already had scratches and dents as did the bathtub."
19,1762,"Aug 6 2009 	A pleasant comfortable stay in a convenient location.	My husband and I just returned from a three night stay in NYC and found this hotel to be perfect for our needs. We searched for a long time for a hotel we could afford in the Times Square area that was not too old or run down. Often reviews of the more reasonable hotels were discouraging. This hotel had only been open for about two weeks and was very comfortable and clean. Being in New York of course it was smaller than most hotel rooms we are use to but the queen size bed had a very thick, comfortable mattress and lovely linens. The room was large enough to also include a comfortable leather-like chair, a corner chest with a flat screen t.v., and also a table for two, a full sized fridge, two burner stove top, microwave, sink and diswasher and utensils. We enjoyed the use of the fridge for cold drinks, ice, etc. The bathroom had a small sink counter but was functional with lots of nice towels. We could be in the centre of the lights of Times Square in 5-10 minutes and also very close to the lovely restaurants of Hell's Kitchen and restaurant row. (Don't eat in the chain restaurants that you can eat in anywhere - go local!) We walked from Penn station to the hotel - an easy 10 inute walk. We got a good price with AAA rates but I do see that even since going the prices have gone up. The staff were very freindly and accommodating and we were given a room as soon as we arrived early in the morning.This room was very comfortable and convenient to everything and we would stay there again."
20,1762,Aug 31 2009 	bien situ
1,1764,"Nov 23 2009 	I'll be back!	Small, quiet and very comfortable hotel. Wonderful bed and shower. Great location!"
2,1764,"Oct 11 2009 	Can not recommend for the price.	It's probably that I'm just not used to NYC prices but this is personally the most I've ever spent for a hotel room. With taxes and everything it was about $330 a night. For $330 a night I kind of expected a little better. The hotel is very small so no services. Of course I didn't need any but still, for $330 a night I guess I expected more. The room was the smallest I've been in outside of a Tokyo. The bed and room were fine and clean and the location as far as being convenient for exploring NYC was fine. Being my first time to NYC I didn't know where to stay although if I was to do it again I'd probably try to pick something near Soho or NYU in Greenwich Village. More stuff to do down there at night.The room we got was in the back facing another building. With the night shades open people can look directly in the room. There's some building air conditioner between the buildings that hums all night. I was able to sleep but I'd really prefer something more quiet, especially for the price. I guess ultimately I couldn't recommend it unless it was your one of your only options. Still, it was clean and the bed was comfortable which is sometimes enough."
3,1764,"Sep 28 2009 	Big disappointment	After reading reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to book a room in this hotel. But when we got there, we found that the room had a glass wall looking onto a horrible view ( we had asked for a quiet room and had been placed at the back of the hotel). The room was small so you couldn't forget the view which was the space between 2 buildings and you got the building air conditioning noise. On top of that, the glass wall was dirty and I had to ask 3 times for an iron and ironing table. I felt I had gotten a terrible deal for $350. Definetly not a romantic place."
4,1764,"Sep 16 2009 	Fantastic Hotel a real Gem in the middle of NewYork	What a great Hotel, new with great facilities including a fridge and safety deposit box.Immaculate room. Recommend to everyone."
5,1764,"Sep 5 2009 	Lovely stay - clean quiet professional staff.	Got a great rate ($138) with Quikbook.com for the Carvi. The hotel is very convenient to a couple of subway lines, but a bit of a hike if you have B'way theater tickets. I spent lots of time in the East Village, West Village and lower Manhattan, and sometimes wished I were closer to the 2 or 3 lines which were more east - so I ended up having to transfer a lot. Not that big of a deal.The room itself was very comfortable - coffee maker in room, free HBO on a nice flat-screen TV, marble bathroom and shower. Quiet location - even with my room facing the street. Starbucks on the corner, and a CVS drugstore a block away.I'd stay again if the rates remain low - but I don't think that'll be the case."
6,1764,"Aug 25 2009 	Great location clean rooms and extremely nice staff	I was a bit dubious about staying at this hotel because nobody had heard of it! The reason for this, I found out, is that it just recently opened two months ago. I was traveling with my daughter (13 years) and my nephew (14) and we were in New York for a week. The room was very clean and for New York standards it was quite spacious. The bedding and linens are outstanding! I only stayed here for a night since we had already booked the rest of the trip in another hotel in Times Square, but I would happily return to this location instead.The manager, a very nice lady, came out one day to greet us and gave us a very warm welcome, she made us feel at home. Please consider this hotel on your next visit to NYC....you won't regret it!"
7,1764,"Jul 27 2009 	Pleasant Efficient Stay	Just returned from a one night stay at the Carvi on 7/25,(reserved on Quickbook for $112.00 minus tax)The accomodations were fine, (spectacular for the price!) room was clean, ample space, marble bathroom, light wood furnishings, flat screen TV, feather pillows, soft towels, etc...There were no ammenities to speak of, but, plenty of food, drink, deli, spa options on the street.There appears to be 6 rooms per 8 floors, served by a single elevator. The lobby was small, staff were pleasant and competent. The place is somewhat non-descript, as it seemed to lack warmth or any memorable detail, but it was more than sufficient for a night's sleep.I would readily book the property for future visits if the price was right."
8,1764,"Jun 25 2009 	Last Minute Treasure	It'd be quite some time since I stayed overnight in The City and although my hotel of preference was the Omni Berkshire, my traveling companion was on a limited budget yet I insisted on at least a 4 star rating. She delayed making a decision on several name brand specials so I found myself searching for a room w/2 beds for less than $250, 10 days prior to our arrival. Booking.com listed the Carvi Hotel - a &quot;new&quot; boutique hotel on E 55th w/ a 2 bed special of $179. Payment was not required until check out so I decided to risk it. What a fabulous find - so nice that I already know where I and several other associates will be staying next year.Everything was fresh, clean and new in this renovated former school; the building at one time owned by Madonna. It had only opened the week prior. Front desk reception was very cordial and the general manager was friendly and anxious to assist w/any questions, suggestions, directions, etc. The beds were most comfortable; there was more than sufficient closet and drawer space for 2 women traveling together. Individual temperature controls in each room and a bathroom boasting marble flooring, a tiled double shower w/glass door and nice toiletries included a shower cap and robes. Because of its newness, the mini bars in the rooms were not yet stocked and the bar in the lobby was still under construction. At the end of the street, however, was J P Clark's, a very nice Irish pub. We weren't there long enough but I'm certain if we had any business center needs, they would have accomodated. IF I had to cite a fault, I'd say the hallway was a bit warm when we waited for our elevator."

1,1766, of course we went to the wrong restaurant who (of course) acted like they had our reservation the whole time. The dinner was less than memorable. When we returned to the hotel
1,1768,"Enjoyed Chelsea Pines Inn very much !	I only have good things to say about Chelsea Pines Inn. From the moment we arrived we were treated as guests should be. Friendly, helpful with shows and resturant recommendations. The extended breakfast hours in the morning helped alot too. I was made to feel welcome and very well taken care of. Thank you to all the staff at Chelsea PInes Inn. I will definitley be back to see you. Regina"
2,1768,The Perfect Location - Clean - Great Hosts	The title says it all! This place was spectacular! Went to NY for a business class and wasn't sure where to stay. Checked homestay.com and saw some great places for more money but Chelsea Pines kept calling to me. The reviews were amazing and the ease of location as well as concierge won me over. Can't say enough about the locale. On all other trips I have stayed uptown and it was such a pleasure to be close to everything all the time. The one bedroom suite was just as pictured and worked great for myself and my employee. The guys at the front desk were gracious from check in to check out (even though we were accidentally stealing H2O from their fridge). It became our home away from home and I will never hesitate to recommend others to or return there myself! Thanks everyone - we had a blast!!!
3,1768,"Good job Jay!	Clean, friendly, idiosyncratic [we showered in a closet, but it worked] and [relatively] quiet. Great location away from the snooty people on upper 5th. Felt like real NY experience. Jay and the crew were great hosts. We'll go backA few tips. we Europeans like light breakfasts but a bit of ham or smoked salmon wouldn't go amiss; look after the rear garden, it could be real treasure; warn us older folks about the climb or offer rooms on the 2nd floor"
4,1768,"Nov 25 2009 	Really NOT all that....	Having read several 'great' reviews of this place on trip-advisor, in Gay times and online we were really looking forward to our stay here but unfortunatley, overall we were dissapointed and the reviews did not live up to the really thing. We always take trip advisor reviews with a pinch of salt and it takes alot to make us 'complain' or moan but on this occassion when your spending quite alot of money on a room I think its neccessary. We opted for a deluxe room but in our opinion apart for the arty film posters on the wall there was nothing more deluxe about it than a Days Inn - it was on the 5th floor which meant a hard lugg of our cases up there after a long journey - no offer of help either. The stair wells and landing were tatty and also all rooms are named after a film star with a star plaque on each door - not one didn't have paint splashed all around it like it had been painted in a rush which looked really bad. On one occassion our room wasn't made up when we got back from a day out - didn't get much of an apology either just shoved afew new shampoos.  There was nothing special about the staff - they did there very least really. Hi/Bye kinda thing which when you read how great the staff are it makes you wonder. Breakfast is fine although they could do with more than one small toaster for the morning rush of toasted bagels. On a positive note - the location is excellent just 50metres or so to a metro station and right in the heart of the gay district for bars, clubs and restuarants. We had a great time in NY but the Chelsea Pines Inn although perfectly comfortable but for the price you are paying really does not live up to the hype!"
5,1768,"Nov 24 2009 	Glowing with charm!	If you are sick of the usual service and composition you see every time you travel, the Chelsea Pines Inn is a must-try for every curious traveler to New York City.Simply put, the reviews dont lie. Yes the hotel is exceedingly clean, perfectly situated and perhaps the coziest place away from home you could imagine; butThe real blessing is the staff who could not have gone further out of there way to accommodate our never-ending questions on our first visit to NYC. From event tickets, restaurant recommendations to subway directions, we truly felt like the only guests in the hotel. The quality of service will leave you smiling, guaranteed.We cannot wait to go back. No elavator?! Who cares, each step represents how much better this hotel must be than any other in NYC. Truly a gem."
6,1768,Nov 24 2009 	What a find!!!	We found this brilliant little hotel on Trip Adviser and picked it because of the great reviews. It was so good!!! If you love movies and movies stars this is the hotel for you!! The hotel is filled with wonderful old movie posters. From the minute we walked in to the minute we left the staff were great! The room was clean. Great sheets on the bed!!! The breakfast area is lovely and good mix of things to eat. I will be going back next week to stay another night!! Great location.
7,1768,"Nov 24 2009 	Just Couldn't Live up to the Hype	The danger of so many five star reviews for, in facility terms at least, a modest hotel is that it can raise expectations , sometimes unrealistically.The excellent service and welcome are well documented in other reviews but we found these to be distinctly patchy on our visit, with levels of service and helpfulness varying greatly between the staff (the owner was a total starton every occasion, I have to say). When I cut my finger at breakfast I was faced with someone who seemed to have little urgency to help and couldn't even find a first aid kit. Some of the recommendations given were also less than enthusiastic, which for first time visitors was a little disappointing - it's this kind of service that's supposed to make Chelsea Pines stand out. We also had a room mix up which led to us having to move after one night and when we were confused over the tax on the final bill we found one of the staff pretty off hand.Again, as documented, the rooms are original and I can see how this would make a welcome change if you stay at faceless branded hotels regularly, but, from speaking to friends since, for the price it's not totally a value option - with offers at some larger hotels you can match what you'd pay here.Overall, it's about the hotel experience you want and it didn't really work for us despite the excellent location, some friendly staff and friendly other guests. My advice would be to consider hotels in a similar price bracket/package deal and set realistic expectations. While it wasn't what I was looking for, it's clearly doing lots right for a lot of people."
8,1768,"Nov 19 2009 	The perfect place to stay in New York	Having been to NY 5 times and always stayed in mid town we were keen to stay closer to the areas we spend most fo our time in. And as a 7 month pregnant lady we wanted to make this trip memorable as it will be our last as a twosome.We found this hotel on the New York Times website (always a good start) and couldn't fault a thing. From the moment we arrived we had such a warm welcome and the guys couldnt do enough to make us feel at home. The hotel itself is realy nicely done. The collection of old movie posters everywhere is a lovely touch and we were thrilled ot be in the Tony Curtis room (next door to the doris day room natch).The room was spotless with a big comfy bed, nice ensuite bathroom with a good power shower. Not huge but bigger than many of the other boutique hotels we've stayed at in NY.The breakfast being included was great too - lovely fresh coffee, muffins, bagels and doughnuts plus cereal, yoghurt and fruit set us up well for our days out.And the location was perfect. A 10 minute walk to the magnolia Bakery and the gorgeousness of the west village on the doorstep. Then Pastis and all the other Meatpacking district bars and restaurants at the end of the street.Don't miss the highline walk whilst you're there. A beautiful way to see the city and again right on the doorstep.I coudn't recommend this place more. We are used to staying in lovely boutique hotels that cost twice as much but have not had as warm a welcome as we did here."
9,1768,"Nov 17 2009 	Most Amazing New York Experience!	Where you stay on a vacation will make or break a great trip. The service we received while on our honeymoon was phenomenal. Jay and his staff are great. We received nothing but courteous and helpful service our whole stay. Everything from where to eat to getting us tickets to Broadway Shows. The room was perfect. It was all done out in Silver Screen memorabilia. Most importantly, the room was clean! The whole hotel was clean and new feeling for an older building. The complimentary media room was also a great plus.The surrounding area has to be the best in NYC. I've been before and we were there for a friends wedding. It was funny to find us in our area at the end of the night when out on the stag and wedding night as a group. Incredible restaurants, funky/chill nightclubs and all regular amenities are literally a stones throw away.The personal touches where the icing on the cake for us. Things like the staff taking time to research and find you the best deals on Broadway Shows, Jays homemade bread in the morning and the fresh bouquet that showed up in our room for our honeymoon. We plan on staying here every time we go to New York and I would definitely recommend The Chelsea Pines Inn to anyone and everyone!Thanks guys for a great trip!"
10,1768,"Nov 8 2009 	Loved it	Stayed for five nights in the Donna Reed room, super room with plenty of space and character. Al and his staff (and Charlie) made us feel moore than just guest. Fantastic help with hockey and musical tickets and everything. You really made our stay in NYC priceless. When we come back next time we definitely know where to stayStefan &amp; Katarina"
11,1768,"Nov 8 2009 	Very pleasant we would return	We are a young couple who stayed at Chelsea Pines Inn for 5 nights in May. We enjoyed our stay and would return to this hotel. In its price range, it was significantly better than 2 other small New York hotels I have tried.Pros:- Our room was comfortable and clean and the film star pictures gave it character- The window could be opened for fresh air and a pleasant view of a courtyard- For a New York hotel, it was pretty quiet, with minimal street noise and only noise from other guests in the hallways as they went to their rooms, not between the rooms themselves- Pleasant self-serve breakfast, though fairly minimal in options- Very well located, very close to a subway station, restaurants, shops etc, and walkable to quite a lot of tourist destinations- Great service - the staff at reception went out of their way to be helpful, find restaurants etcCons:- Air conditioner slightly noisy (not a big issue)- We were on the third floor and it was manageable but not pleasant getting in and out with our suitcases, but I wouldn't recommend the upper floors to elderly or mobility impaired guests"
12,1768,"Nov 7 2009 	Great Location quaint film star rooms!!	this hotel is in perfect location for many subway lines, and basically walking distance from most tourist areas. Breakfast was included- muffins, bread and yogurt but wasnt that varied. some rooms are very small, but the beds are comfortable and we didnt spend much time in them anyway! very helpfull staff and super atmosphere which made our stay very enjoyable!"
13,1768,"Nov 6 2009 	Clean Quiet Comfortable Convenient.	Moderately priced Inn with nicely appointed rooms on West 14th Street. Wifi and breakfast included, great value. L train is a half block away so making the transfer uptown at Union Square is a snap. Service was stellar, went out of their way to make my short stay extremely comfortable. Great alternative for business travelers tired of the big boxy and expensive (twice the price) mid town hotels"
14,1768,Nov 5 2009 	Halloween in NYC	Flew out from LA and met with a friend from Albuquerque for Halloween in the Big Apple. Daniel and Xavier provided superior customer service which made a great weekend even better!
15,1768,"Nov 4 2009 	Perfect Chelsea location with great movie theme rooms and a super staff.	Chelsea Pines Inn is a great place to stay. It's charming with the feeling of a bed and breakfast, but the privacy of a hotel. The rooms are movie themed with terrific photos and posters of movie stars of the silver screen. The staff is warm and friendly, and the owner and gm in particular are theater nuts and have wonderful advice/assistance to offer if you are at all interested in seeing shows while in town. They celebrate NY, which makes it even easier to find the best places to dine, enjoy art, and see the town. There is even a Inn Cat (&quot;Charlie&quot;) who is very friendly and makes the place feel like home."
16,1768,"Oct 29 2009 	A place to come back as soon as possible	We had a wonderful stay at the Chelsea Pine Inn. The staff is extremely friendly and the location is very nice, close to the beatiful Meat District with all the nice reaturants and caf's."
17,1768,"Oct 26 2009 	great place great people	Just really really nice people there, enjoy your stay as we did!"
18,1768,"Oct 26 2009 	The perfect first time NYC experience	We recently returned from our stay (October 22-25) at the fabulous Chelsea Pines Inn and I couldn't wait to write a glowing recommendation. We arrived at noon and despite our early arrival were almost instantly shown to our room.Jay and Al were quick to show us around and ask us if it was our first time in New York. The answer yes garnered lots of good advice (how to use the subway, where it would be fun to stroll on such a gorgeous day, here are this month's shows if you are interested.) The staff arranged tickets to a show, a car to pick us up when it was time for us to depart and everything else we asked of them.The room was lovely, the space clean and the amenities plentiful. The garden and sunroom were the perfect places to start my day with a book and a bagel. And for a cat lover, having Charlie mew good morning each day was extra special.I can't speak highly enough of the Inn, the staff or the neighbourhood."
19,1768,"Oct 21 2009 	The perfect location with a very friendly and helpful staff.	subway only 100 feet away. right on the edge of the Village, Chelsae and Meat Packing District. plenty of restaurants, shopping and parks. Charlie the cat was ther to greet you every day you came back.. Business center available to check e-mail. Nice daily news letter on what is going on in City. Will stay here on next visit."
20,1768,"Oct 21 2009 	A real gem!	We just love Chelsea Pines and would recomend it to anyone travelling to NYC. It is a gay hotel, but we have stayed with heterosexual friends several times and they have always made them just as welcome. The hotel location is Chelsea/Meatpacking district with a subway right on the corner, so you are in a great part of town. Rates are good value for NYC and you get the wonderful bonus of breakfast, too. Rooms are clean and comfortable - I think the ONLY thing I would suggest is that as the buidling is tall with no lift, if you have any mobility problems make sure you ask for a room on the lower floors.Staff are the most helpful and welcoming I have ever come across anywhere. I think its advantage is that it is not part of a chain, so the atmosphere is set by its wonderful owner, Jay. Book in and enjoy your stay!"
21,1768,"Oct 20 2009 	A great place to stay in New York	My partner and I stayed a week at Chelsea Pines and I would definitely stay again. Location is excellent, only 50 metres to the subway station and we found Chelsea to be a very safe area close to some good venues. The hotel is very clean and tidy and the staff were all very helpful. Our room was very quiet and the breakfast each day is excellent. It was our first visit to New York and Chelsea Pines was a great base."
22,1768,"Oct 19 2009 	Fabulous friendly great located Inn in Chelsea/West Village	I've been staying at the Cheleas Pines Inn for almost 20 years, for both business and personal trips. The management continues to improve and upgrade the Inn to the point where it rivals the best of small boutique hotels in NYC. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the rooms are very comfortable, and the amenities are top-notch. The new 2-room suites are very nice and ideal for 2 friends travelling together. And the location on the border between the West Village and Chelsea can't be beat for restaurants, shopping, night life, and easy subway access to all of NYC."
23,1768,Oct 19 2009 	Wonderful hotel - Great staff!	Had a wonderful stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn. Beautiful inside and out. Charming converted five story walk up. Decorated with lots of classic movie star posters and pictures. I stayed in the Lee Remick suite. Lovely! Comfortable queen size bed. Gorgeous bathroom! Nice breakfast in the morning. Great business center with computers/printers. The staff was first rate! The subway was just down the block. Very easy to get uptown to shows and shopping! Would happily stay again!
24,1768,"Oct 19 2009 	Great location most enjoyable stay and frienly staff	We were returning guests and , once again, greatly appreciated the Chelsea Pines Inn for its convenient location and for the improvements in room renovations and other things like Business Center. The breakfast is generous and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back again !"
25,1768,"Oct 19 2009 	Great place to stay in NYC; friendly staff great location and nice rooms	We stayed in the Celsea Pines Inn for three nights and really liked the place. The location is right on 14th between 5th and 6th, close to / in Chelsea, Soho and Meatpackers. The first thing you notice when you step into the hotel is that its cozy, clean and well kept. Second thing you notice is the very friendly staff who welcome you, very nice indeed. The room we stayed in was one of the standard rooms; cozy, functional, with a good bathroom, nice bed and a view to the garden. Also loved the breakfast, fresh bagels, juices etc! The only downside was that we booked last minute so we had the room on the top / Fourth floor (no elevator) so a good workout to get to and from your room. Other than that we loved our stay. I would really recommend this hotel and we would come back!"
26,1768,Oct 17 2009 	Simply the Best	It was comfortable &amp; restful. The full kitchen downstairs was amazing; They had homemade orange peel bread one morning - wow! Room was clean &amp; a little larger than expected. Front desk seem to not know a stranger; I was treated like a guest in someone's home and not like a customer. Will stay here again.
27,1768,"Oct 10 2009	Great Style and decor...helpful staff	My daughter and I stayed in this boutique hotel, and were delighted with our room and the staff. Our room was small (there are larger rooms, we just figured we wouldn't be spending much time in ours, so decided to save and use the savings elsewhere) but was so well designed that it worked very well and was comfortable. Bathroom upgraded and upscale with granite counter, tile and plush linens. Love the old Hollywood decor and movie posters. Desk staff very helpful, and issue an info page each morning with weather forecast, interesting things to do, etc. Business room has computers and a printer at no charge...Continental breakfast included. No elevators though, so we got a good workout to the fourth floor. Close to the subway station."
28,1768,"Oct 7 2009 	My first visit in NY was fab thank's to the guys at Chelsea Pines Inn	This hotel in NY isn't just situated in a really nice area. It's clean, welcoming, has creative and fun decorated rooms and foremost a wonderful staff. They will help you find what ever you're looking fore and they fill this special little family-reeling hotel with a nice atmosphere. A big plus for the small backyard, where you can take your cup of coffe in the morning. // Nina from Sweden"
29,1768,"Oct 5 2009 	A superb home from home with the friendliest of staff	We had stayed at this hotel 3 years previously and chose to return as we found its facilities, location and the helpfulness of the staff an absolute must. In fact, the hotel had been refurbished and the new internet suite came in very handy as I discovered I'd lost my wallet on arriving there! The owner, Jay, couldn't have been more concerned and helpful as regards this unfortunate occurence."
30,1768,"Oct 4 2009 	Cute small hotel	We stayed three nights in this hotel and were pleased. I had booked a double room in advance and everything was alright when we checked in. Hotels rooms are dedicated to film stars and we stayed in Rock Hudson room. I loved the interior and old movie posters. The only downside in this hotel is that it doesn't have a lift and the steps are pretty narrow and steep.The room had separate hall with a small table, two chairs and a fridge. Bedroom was spacious and there was also couple of chairs and a small table. Bathroom was clean and comfortable. There's really nothing bad to say about the room, it was cozy and we liked it.Breakfast was included with the price and there were the basic stuff: bread, cereal, coffee, tea and juice. Hotel is located on the 14th street and the location pleased us, we didn't want to stay near tourist attractions. Subway entrance is near, there were many nice restaurants nearby and some interesting shops. It is a gay neighborhood so if you have a problem with that, I suggest you stay somewhere else. We had an enjoyable stay and could stay here again!"
31,1768,"Sep 30 2009 	Clean stylish hotel with fantastic service in great location.	Stayed at Chelsea Pines for the first time after reading great reviews on Trip Advisor. Was not disappointed... in fact even better than we expected. Chelsea Pines is in a great location (walking distance) for Meatpacking District, West Village and Soho which all have great shopping, dining and nightlife. Hotel was spotlessly clean with fabulous bed linens and plush towels. Staff were all extremely friendly and helpful catering to our every need with a genuine smile. Great breakfast every morning which is served until 11am which is nice not to have to get up at the crack of dawn after a night on the town :) The check out time of 12noon is nice too... most place in NYC are 11am. Would highly recommend this hotel to both couples and families looking for a small, friendly, stylish &quot;family run&quot; place to stay. We will definately be back."
32,1768,"Sep 27 2009 	Friendly stay in great location	Chelsea Pines is gay-friendly: straights should read that as simply friendly. It was a key part in my wife's enjoyment of her first visit to New York (from New Zealand), and she thinks it the most characterful place she's ever stayed.It's not a full-service hotel, but the staff are very friendly and obliging, and they organized a car to Newark International in the middle of the night with great efficiency. The self-service breakfast is excellent in the bagels-and-muffins genre, and there are lots of places to eat in the immediate neighbourhood; the Chelsea Pines recommendations are both reliable and very precise (once you make the simple step of realizing that &quot;convivial&quot; can mean &quot;noisy,&quot; to fogies like me).Chelsea Pines is Hollywood themed, and there are lots of movie posters around, but it is not over the top. It is quiet and restful, and the hotel cat is of the meditative kind (well, he's old and sleeps a lot). It was a real pleasure to come back here in the evening.We had a premium room, with good space, though the whole building is kind of narrow, so the space is mostly in the length dimension. Everything was clean and worked properly, the bed was huge and very comfortable (and firm, which is excellent for aging backs on a sight-seeing trip). The noise level is excellent for its location, and we had no trouble sleeping.We're already recommending this to our friends, and hope to return soon."
33,1768,"Sep 21 2009 	The Inn's warm welcome carried on throughout our stay.	Excellent location, with a very pleasant and helpful staff. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and enjoyed our banter with all staff members. We appreciated their wonderful and insightful ideas and recommendations for things to do and places to eat."
34,1768,"Sep 21 2009 	I can't recommend this hotel highly enough	I have just returned from New York after spending 5 fabulous nights at the Cheslea Pines with a group of girls to celebrate my birthday. What a treat this place is. Clean, stylish, incredibly welcoming, and an all round pleasure to stay in. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff were brilliant, so friendly and helpful (even putting up with 6 girls in high heels clattering around the place) and the added touch of a bunch of flowers in my room on my birthday was a lovely surprise. The 3 rooms we stayed in were really spacious, clean and the beds were so comfortable!Breakfast each morning was also an added treat, where yummy bagels, muffins and home made breads were all laid out waiting for us. A lovely way to start the day.The location is excellent, with a subway stop just down the street. All in all, we had a lovely time and I'm so glad I found this gem of a place!"
35,1768,"Sep 12 2009 	great room great staff great location	Staying at Chelsea Pines Inn was a pleasure. The room was very comfortable, nicely decorated and seemed new. The aircon in summer was a definate plus. We slept really well as it was very quiet, but in a busy bustling area of NYC. The staff were very friendly, including the resident cat. Each room is named after a hollywood movie star and has photos and posters up of the star in your room. I would recommend this place to friends and would stay there again myself."
36,1768,"Sep 9 2009 	Great location great people great place!	The &quot;Pines&quot; is a great respite from the New York pace. I visit for work quite often and really appreciate the personalized service and attention. I have been a customer for 15 years and have never had a negative experience. I look forward to my time there, it feels like home!"
37,1768,"Sep 8 2009 	So Friendly and greatly located	if you are fed up with hotel chains you will love this charming guest house, ideally located in Chelsea and near the Meatpacking district, one of the hot spot of NY.the staff is really nice and helpful, for sure we will return."
38,1768,"Sep 8 2009 	Classy interesting small hotel in a fabulous neighborhood.	Classic, movie-themed small hotel is fun and comfortable. If you aren't used to stairs, be sure to request a room on one of the lower floors."
39,1768,"Sep 8 2009 	cool fun and friendly	This place was excellent in every way. I rang to make a reservation and requested a quiet room, so we had one facing the garden which was fine. The people on the desk were extremely knowledgeable, warm and helpful, making us feel that nothing was too much trouble. The hotel is in a great location, near the new High Line park which is wonderful, and very handy for the Subway. There is a daily information sheet they produce, telling you what's on and stuff of interest. The room was very comfortable and clean, with air conditioning (essential in August). We took two teenage boys (14 and 18) and they both loved it as well. It was both very relaxed and extremely efficient, I would highly recommend it."
40,1768,"Sep 7 2009 	Fantabulous	From the location to the people, nothing beats Chelsea Pines. I just wish I had a permanent room there. convenient to the Meatpacking District and Greenwich Village, Chelsea Pines is a little home away from home."
41,1768,"Sep 6 2009 	Great value and location	We are not very keen on anonimous big chain owned hotels and based on the reviews on Tripadvisor decided to give it a chance on our first visit to New York.  It was a great decision. We stayed for 12 nights at the Debby Reynolds suite which consisted of a decently sized bedroom and a small sitting room, equiped with flat TV in each room, air conditioning, private complete bath, hairdryer, refrigerator and air conditioning ,The location is great, right between Chelsea and the Village, near a lot of good restaurants, and just a few steps from a multi line subway station, The free wi-fi , business center and continental breakfast were a much appreciated plus.Staff was very nice, corteous and helpful. Daniel: thank you very much for your all your assistance.It will definetely be our hotel in NYK."
42,1768,"Sep 6 2009 	It felt like being home in the great city of New York	Chelsea Pines Inn is, hands down, the nicest hotel I've stayed at, since I moved out of the New York area four years ago. I've stayed at a number of places, since my move - and Chelsea Pines Inn was the one that felt like home - sophisticated, like the city itself, with a wonderful sense of style and humor in its decor (B movie stars), an incredibly friendly staff, a clean quiet room, a terrific range of breakfast choices, a great little garden in back for that first coffee of the day... I'm a playwright, and was in town to see a performance of a play of mine - and Chelsea Pines even went to the trouble of blurbing my play, in their daily in-house newsletter... Close to subways, great restaurants, the wonderful new High Line park - I couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay... Hope to stay there again, and highly recommend it."
43,1768,"Aug 26 2009	This hotel had a most comfortable atmosphere with all the conveniences of home.	This is a clean and comfortable hotel, which offers ample self serve breakfasts included in the price. The staff are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful in all ways. There are computers available to use at all times. The location is great - accessible to public transportation and all amenities. My daughter and I had a great time. I am diabetic so having breakfast on the premises and a fridge in the room for snacks were very important to me. The only drawback would be the stairs (no elevator) if climbing is a problem, however the staff are more than willing to help out with luggage if necessary. Ask for a lower floor is this is a concern."
44,1768,"Aug 24 2009 	Friendly comfortable and cool as hell!	This place is fantastic! My girlfriend and I spent two nights here on a break from working at a camp and it was absolutely perfect!The staff were super friendly and helpful. Made us feel more than welcome and gave us a load of information on where to go in the local area, including one amazing Vietnamese restaurant round the corner.The rooms were very spacious and comfortable and the movie star themes were very cool and quirky. We felt very much at home and comfortable in the hotel and really enjoyed the self service/kitchen style breakfast bar and back garden. Hopefully will return to this hotel next time we're in New York."
45,1768,"Aug 21 2009 	Great Choice for a NYC Visit	We stayed here for 4 nights in August - thank god the air conditioning worked! ;-)It's a terrific choice - the price, given the location, was excellent. Then, you have the staff, who were all very, very nice. They were happy to advise on restaurants, routes through Central Park, Metropolitan Museum of Art, etc.It was a little surprising when we opened the door to our room when we arrived and Charlie (Chaplin) the cat walked out, but we love cats, and enjoyed patting him on the head whenever we saw him.The room is typical for an urban area like NY - oddly shaped (super narrow), but that, plus the movie posters gave it a fun, funky feel. BTW, we were in the Lee Remick room....The only negative thing that happened during our visit was the gas company starting construction right out the front door (and below our 4th floor window) at 6 AM one day. Of course, the hotel had nothing to do with that - it got us out of bed and on our way for the day, at least.The breakfast was fine - there was a good mix of bagels, muffins, cereal, and fruit to go along with juice and coffee. The TV was tuned to a news station, so we could catch up with current events if we wanted.It was great having a subway station about 100 feet from the front door - we each bought an unlimited ride 7-day ticket for $25 and got our money's worth, even though we were there for only 3 days.The neighborhood felt super safe - if you head south (into the Village?), there are a zillion restaurants to choose from in a lively setting.When it was time to leave, the front desk made arrangements for a car service to take us to JFK - it's only a few dollars more than a taxi, and a lot more comfortable.I will absolutely stay here again - it was terrific!!"
46,1768,"Aug 21 2009 	Good value great location cute cat	Have stayed at this Inn three times over the last ten years or so - it's always been fun and great value. It's especially good if you are in your 20s and 30s and on a bit of a budget - or if if it is your first time to NY.It is set in a great red brick building and has an extension at the back for breakfast and chilling out.The rooms are named after various celebrities, such as Rock Hudson, but it's all done on the right side of camp.Essentially it is, of course, a gay Inn, but friendly enough for all to feel welcome - though to be fair, it is not the sort of place to go with a young family.It is really close to the Metro and has some great places to eat and drink nearbye, thanks to its location in Chelsea/Greenwich.The times I have stayed there I have always found the place to be clean. The rooms are of a good size (you should pay the extra for the better rooms if you can) and the facilities are good.I have not been there for a few years now and I hear the prices have gone up, which would be a shame and I have marked it down a bit because of this - it is still a place to go on a small-medium budget (as much as one can in NY).It can get a bit noisy when people are coming up the stairs (note - stairs, no lift) late, but in this place, it only ever seemed to add to the atmosphere. Likewise, yes, you can hear sirens, but it's in the middle of NYC - I would ask for refund if I could not hear the noise of the City!I don't know if I will ever stay there again, I have different circumstances now, but I have very, very fond memories of my three visits there and, of course, of New York. What else to say? The cat from here and the cat from the Brass Key in Provincetown both know how to run very good guest-houses!"
47,1768,"Aug 21 2009 	I have great time	I spent 2 nights in August at Chelsea Pines Inn, I had a great time. People was very freindly and the hotel was very well located. I recommened have the experience, also I suggest to have lunch at Chelsea Market, just 5 minutes wak from the hotel.Cheers,Karen Gilchrist(Chile)"
48,1768,"Aug 19 2009 	excellent accommodation	I don't know what were the expectations of people that wrote a negative review on this place, because we' ve found a clean and cozy hotel, with a courteous and pleasant staff that gave us many suggestions on restaurant and place to visit. We stayed in the &quot;Donna Reed&quot; room for three nights: maybe it's not a big room (just like a lot of other places in NY...), but was clean and comfortable.I will recommend this place to friends that are looking for a place different from an anonymous hotel owned by big chains, this is an hotel that has its own personality."
49,1768,"Aug 15 2009	a delight!	The Chelsea Pines Inn was an excellent place to stay in every way. Perhaps the most notable aspect of this charming hotel is the delightful staff. Everyone we met was friendly and very willing to go the extra mile to be helpful. Moreover, the hotel was sparkling clean and tastefully decorated, the location can't be beat and the breakfasts were excellent. This place is much more personable than your average hotel; but more casual and enjoyable than staying in a prissy bed and breakfast. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting New York for any purpose."
50,1768,"Aug 9 2009 	Definitely ""our"" hotel in NYC from now on!	My husband and I recently spent 4 days in NYC at The Chelsea Pines Inn. It was perfect! The staff is excellent (friendly &amp; attentive with daily newsletter that highlighted things we would have missed otherwise), the location you can't beat - subway just a few steps away, quick walk to the HiLine park overlooking the Hudson (don't miss this), Chelsea Market, great restaurants, etc. The rooms are quiet, very clean, sophisticated &amp; beautifully updated,(baths, flat screen TV, A.C. &amp; more) and they offer about every size/arrangement you could need from single rooms to neat little suites. The business center on second floor made keeping in touch with work, printing maps, researching the city very easy and convenient. Loved the nice touch of the kitchen/breakfast area - and the 24-7 cookie jar. I especially enjoyed being able to have coffee and breakfast on the patio outside and read the NYTimes. For some, the stairs (no elevator) may give you pause, but I found a 5th floor room not an issue at all and after the first day of &quot;training&quot; my husband actually welcomed the exercise and noticed improved conditioning each day. Of course, you can stay on lower floors too. It is a great value. Can't think of a single thing to improve. If you want your nails done, dry cleaning,etc. plenty of great places nearby. F.M.Andrews Louisville, KY"
51,1768,Aug 9 2009 	Great Service Location 	I recently enjoyed staying in a suite at the Chelsea Pines Inn. On arrival the service was excellent (continued from all staff during stay) and we were quickly and efficiently directed to our room. The suite is quite roomy with separate bedroom and extra television. There was plenty of room to store our luggage and the bathroom was excellent with a large shower and two basins. The room was on the 5th floor (no lifts) which was a bit of struggle after a day out exploring New York although well always a pleasure to return to. The breakfast offered was good and location excellent. There is a subway station along from the Inn and there are plenty of sights that can be visited on foot. The inn provides a computer room with free internet access and also supplies a daily newsletter with events and touring suggestions. The reception staff were also very helpful in providing information for sightseeing. I would not hesitate to recommend the Inn to other travellers and will return there on my next trip to New York.
52,1768,"Aug 8 2009 	Our first trip to NYC	We had the opportunity to stay at Chelsea Pines while we were in NYC. This was our first trip to NYC and we were looking for a safe, affordable place. Not only is Chelsea Pines all of those things it is much more. I can't say enough good things about them. They were friendly, helpful and accomodating from the moment we arrived. They checked our baggage, offered us breakfast and got us into our room quickly. Our entire stay was enjoyable. I felt like family and can't wait to return. P.S. Charlie Chaplin the cat really looks like Charlie Chaplin!"
53,1768,Aug 7 2009 	The Chelsea Pines Hotel is a safe and clean place to stay in New York.	The Chelsea Pines Hotel is a safe and clean place to stay in New York. All of the hotel employees went out of their way to make our first trip to the big city the best. They provided a daily listing of interesting sites and discount coupons. Their front door is just steps from the subway and the continental breakfast was well supplied. Even the hotel owner checked on us! Highly recommend.
54,1768,"Aug 7 2009 	Loved it! great value for NYC	My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was great value for NYC. When we arrived we were upgraded to a deluxe room which by new york standards was huge. There was downside, it was on the 5th floor and there is no lift and it faced out on a busy road but that's new york. It didn't bother us too much.Staff were very friendly and location is great. I'd definitely stay here again."
55,1768,"Aug 7 2009 	Don't hesitate to book a room here!	We chose to stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn based on the very positive reviews we found on Trip Advisor. We weren't disappointed and spent a wonderful couple of days there. Jay and his staff have created a very pleasant haven for visitors to New York. Our room was clean and spacious, with nice amenities. Everyone on the staff was extremely helpful; the night staff was especially accommodating of our early morning coffee request. Their restaurant recommendations were first-rate too, and they readily made reservations for us. It is also easy to get to and from the inn as it is a half block from the 14th street subway station, from which you can easily get to almost any place in the city. We plan to stay at the Chelsea Pines again and have already recommended the Chelsea Pines to others."
56,1768,"Aug 7 2009 	We'll be back	A charming hotel, great location, and wonderful hosts...the rates were a real bargain...."
57,1768,Aug 6 2009 	Excellent hotel	My wife and i read about the hotel on trip advisor and it certainly lived up to it's reviews. The location was great with the subway only one minute away. The hotel was quiet which was great after a long day site seeing. The rooms were tidy and the cookie jar downstairs was great. The staff and Jay were extremely helpful and had excellent recommendations for things to do and money saving tips. We are looking forward to going back to New York and staying at the Chelsea Pines Inn.
58,1768,"Aug 2 2009 	Hospitality and coziness are the key words when it comes to describing Chelsea Pines Inn	We certainly had a terrific stay at Chelsea Pines Inn. Not only was the staff unusually friendly and helpful, the hotel itself was warm, welcoming and charming. Being Europeans, we value public transportation very highly. C.P.I. is located in a friendly neighborhood with easy access to both Uptown and Downtown. Even if you're not familiar with using the subway-system, the staff (again) is ready to assist. All in all, we give our best recommendations. Susanne &amp; Anders, Denmark."
59,1768,Aug 1 2009 	Great Stay. Conveniently Located. Lovely Hosts.	No suprises at this fantastic B &amp; B. The recommendations provided by Trip Advisor travellers were spot on and we were very happy with our stay. Totally recommend for the younger travellers only because there is no lift access to get to the rooms and the stairway is quite steep :-)Pros: Hosts were very friendly and helpful. 2 min walk to subway. Dry cleaners across the road that provided clothes washing service. Lovely covered court yard to have equally lovely breakfast in. Room and bathroom kept clean and tidy. Strolling/walking distance to Meat Packing District and trendy cafes. Very safe area to live - though you will find Manhattan quite safe anyway! Cons: Small room No PC or laptop provided in common area for surfing the web. Toiletries were not topped up after a couple of days so had to resort to using  shampoo that I had saved away from another hotel stay.  The climb to our room can be a bit tiresomefor older travellers (no lift access)  though the staff were very helpful and carried our luggage up the steep stairs to  our room.
60,1768,Jul 31 2009 	Relax in New York	I go to the big city to get away and Chelsea Pines is a great place to do that. The staff is very helpful with tips on what to see and how to get around. Go to the bookstore and get a small laminated map of the NYC subway system and you can get anywhere you want to go. I have stayed there 5 times and will definitely stay there for my next visit.
61,1768,"Jul 30 2009 	Failed to live up to expectations	I chose the Chelsea Pines Inn carefully as my only previous trip to New York (12 years) ago had been ruined by a substandard hotel. Given the reviews online I was expecting it to be good.The standard of the room was poor. I didn't expect it to be large (I was only paying for the superior standard room) or particularly well-furnished (it is a budget hotel). But I did expect it to be clean. The lavatory was full of waste when I arrived. The shower had not been cleaned and had pieces of paper stuck to the floor that had clearly been there for a while. The bedding, although I think clean, smelt like someone else had slept in it. The quality of the furnishing was also unacceptable. The bed was a spring Z-bed so creaked everytime you rolled over and the handles were hanging off the wardrobe.The pluses were the staff (particularly Art) who were great, the included breakfast and the free-wifi.Sure Chelsea Pines is reasonably cheap but I am sure there must be better places to stay for the same or not much more. I won't be visiting again."
62,1768,"Jul 28 2009 	p e r f e c t	we spent only one night in Manhatten, after we missed a connecting flight, and it was a happy coincidence that we discovered this wonderful little hotel. It is excellent value, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated, and overall the hotel has a very pleasant, decently informal atmosphere. The great staff made our short stay in NYC a great experience. We highly recommend this place."
63,1768,"Jul 27 2009 	Great stay as always	This was my second time at the Chelsea Pines Inn, and I am a totally satisfied customer. The rooms are very interesting, particularly if you're a film buff. They are very clean, and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful- overall, it's a very personal place, and that's very important to me. I'll definitely be back. Tim Hauser"
64,1768,"Jul 27 2009 	Couldn't fault this place-hope to return.	This hotel is a hidden gem. The staff gave us a warm welcome and were incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel was very clean, and we were not bothered by noise. We were thrilled to stay in the Doris Day room at the back of the hotel (recommended). The room was spacious and featured a huge colourful poster above the bed, and lots of other fun movie prints. The ensuite was great and the sheets were fantastic! Breakfasts of coffee, muffins, bagels and cereal were great, and there was ample room to store our luggage on the final day of our stay. Nearby attractions include the High Line (elevated park from a converted railway), the Mac store (really - it is glorious) and fabulous places to eat and drink. I hope to return to the Chelsea Pines Inn - it was wonderful!"
65,1768,"Jul 26 2009 	More stars than there are in Heaven....	As visitors know, finding a good and not overly expensive hotel in NYC is not an easy task. We discovered Chelsea Pines Inn through a New York Times review - a very positive one indeed. Now, having been Chelsea Pines Inn guests twice, we,d like to share some additional positive comments. Chelsea Pines Inn successfully mixes high standard services typical of a multiple star hotel with a cosy and, we'd say, familiar atmosphere. Standard rooms may be small but enriched by nice bathrooms, colorful decoration, confortable beds and complimentary wi-fi. The small Business Center, recently added, with two brand new computers and a printer, represents a further improvement of the already high standard of the available services (whever asked the staff is eager to help with ticket reservations, suggestions or anything you mighy need). At Chelsea Pines Inn the day starts with an original and useful newsletter (The Chelsea Morning) slipped under your room's door, suggesting attractions shows and concerts for the day, followed by a rich breakfast, that you can enjoy in the kitchen or in the conservatory ,in a very informal atmosphere. You feel at home but at the same time the personnel is always careful and available, ready to refill the serving plates where you can find bagels, muffins, scones and even salmon and fresh cream, during the we. In conclusion do not expect the standard chain hotel's features or atmosphere (there is no elevator and some of the rooms might be perceived as too small) but Chelsea Pines Inn's slogan &quot;more stars than there are in Heaven&quot; is definitely appropriate! Whenever we leave in the taxi to the airport we start planning to come back."
66,1768,Jul 23 2009 	Not as great as I'd hoped...	Read reviews and booked based on what I'd read. It was a very friendly place but didn't have the wow factor I had imagined. Breakfast sometimes ran out (the bagels are amazing) and shower was cold. Wasn't the cleanest of rooms (hair in bathroom). Was a bit small for a suite (specifically wanted more space). Liked location although on main road so very noisey. Recommend going on High Line and Brass Monkey bar as well as lovely bars on Bleeker Street which are all nearby.
67,1768,"Jul 18 2009 	LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!	This was my 2nd stay at Chelsea Pines and I did not think it could be better than the last, but it was. I was greeted by the SAME staff as the last trip a year earlier. The lengths that EVERYONE went too, to help me during my trip was above and beyond what I ever expected. ( I was there this trip due to a death in the family). The best attraction in NYC for me is this welcoming inn on 14th street. There is no other place for me to stay when I come to the City. You will love the staff, atmosphere, rooms and the breakfast."
68,1768,"Jul 5 2009 	Can't wait to go back!	I picked this hotel due to it's ratings on here. I loved every minute of my stay! I went with my boyfriend and stayed in a standard double which was really spacious and the bed was amazingly comfortable. The themes to the rooms is really cool and the cookies and tea and coffee that you can get free all the time is a nice touch. It's so relaxing at breakfast coz you can just make whatever you want and chill out. The staff are all so friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them! The location is perfect for a young couple, we loved wandering the streets of chelsea and greenwich village. Highlight was the safron vietnamese restaurant near the hotel which we were recommended by the staff, brilliant food and pretty reasonable.LOVE LOVE LOVE! I'm booking my next stay there now!"
69,1768,"Jun 29 2009 	Love love love the Chelsea Pines Inn	Booking a hotel based on its website it always a leap of faith...will it be any good, what will the staff be like, will it be in a good area etc? When we arrived at the Chelsea Pines Inn I was incredibly happy with the decision we had made. It's in a fabulous location, nice and close to the subway, and tons of fabulous restaurants, cafes and delis. I'd been warned before getting to NY that the rooms would be ridiculously small, but again, I was pleasantly surprised to get a decent sized room with a great bathroom (the shower was amazing). The hotel staff were helpful and friendly and provided great information of things to do around the area. Charlie the cat was gorgeous and is definitely worthy of a kiss and cuddle every morning.Breakfast was included, and was a perfect start to a day of sightseeing. Bagels, coffee, cereal etc were set out every morning in the kitchen. YUM! The complimentary business centre had 2 computers and a printer, which nmade it easy to look up addresses, keep in touch with people at home, and print off boarding passes for our next location. If you stay there, don't miss out on walking the high line (ask the hotel staff). It was a beautiful, tranquil idyll in the middle of a bustling city, and a testament to the people who worked so hard to get a disused transport corridor turned into urban greenspace.Again, I would heartily recommend the hotel to anyone wanting to experience a great location in a hotel that provides personal service and comfortable surrounds."
70,1768,"Jun 25 2009 	Why Stay Anywhere Else The Chelsea Pines Inn Is Fantastic!	Four years ago a colleague turned me on to the Chelsea Pines Inn and it immediately became my only choice for lodging in Manhattan. It is in a great section of the city - meat packing / Greenwich Village that is convenient for business or personal needs. The property is charming and is very well maintained. The staff, including Charlie the cat, are nothing less than excellent, really, everyone on the staff is really great. Until recently i traveled to the area for business in both Manhattan and Connecticut. Although I no longer have professional responsibilities in Manhattan, I still stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn and commute to Connecticut. Yes, the Chelsea Pines is that great. When it comes to the bed &amp; breakfast concept, they do it right and better than anyone else around. I highly recommend it. I am a frequent lodger and will continue to be. Hopefully I'll run into you there!"
71,1768,"Jun 22 2009 	Wonderful Place Wonderful People	My husband and I LOVED this place. It is quite charming. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They made us feel at home right away. We had booked a standard room which we expected to be small for NYC standards, but it was actually bigger than the room we stayed at during our previous visit to NYC at a popular mid town hotel which actually cost much more per night without any of the coziness the Chelsea Pines Inn provided. Even better, the second day we were there the manager upgraded us to a super deluxe room at no extra charge! How nice is that? I instantly fell in love with our room, the Jeffrey Hunter room, with it's blue walls and vintage movie posters. The bed was super comfy too. We had a nice sitting area with a little table and two chairs. The room had a nice sized mini fridge and a wardrobe for clothes. The private bathrooms were surprisingly large and attractively decorated. Our first room had a lovely modern glass bowl sink, and our second had a glass block wall for the shower. The room was impecably clean as was the entire Inn. The fact that it's a walk-up wasn't an issue at all for us as we got used to the excercise fairly quickly. The location is fantastic: only steps away from the crosstown L train and the A/C/E trains. The complimentary breakfast: bagels, muffins, doughnuts, cereals, yogurt, juice and coffee was quite tasty and came in handy on the go. And last but certainly not least, Charlie Chaplin the Inn's black and white cat was always ready for a visit and scratch behind his ears. I would recommend this place highly and I can't wait to go back!!!"
72,1768,"Jun 19 2009 	A great location friendly and helpful staff clean comfortable and definitely worth returning to.	Close to several markets, Greenwich, West Village, the new Promenade, the Hudson River, the subway and a number of super restaurants. If the New York hustle and bustle is not for you 24/7 this is your spot with very easy access to it all from a quieter neighbourhood. Thanks to Jay and his colleagues for your suggestions."
73,1768,May 26 2009 	Terrific small hotel with lots of personality	Terrific small hotel with personality. Lots of personal attention. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooms are all different. Nice breakfast. Feels like your coming home after a busy city day or evening. Small business center allows free use of computers. Great location within walking distance to the Village and Chelsea. Subway on the corner.
74,1768,"May 8 2009 	Have stayed at the Library Hotel and the Casablanca but would choose Chelsea Pines any day	We've been to NYC several times and stayed in a variety of hotels including some that have very good reviews on Trip Advisor. However, we had never stayed in the Village and this hotel appealed based on the reviews we'd read and the price. We were not disappointed. We booked a standard room, and asked for a high floor with a room at the back of the inn. We were given the Ann Margaret room, which was on the 4th floor overlooking the back garden. It was larger than we expected and had room for 2 armchairs in addition to the bed. There was also a built in wardrobe, safe, fridge, flat screen tv and i-pod docking station. There was also plenty of room to strore our empty suitcases (behind the armchairs). The bed was really comfy and the room was nice and quiet with no street noise (being at the back) and no noise from neighbouring rooms despite the inn being pretty full. Yes, it's a long climb up 4 flights of stairs, but it got easier as the week progressed and helped us work off the generous (free) breakfasts of muffins, bagels, pastries, fruit, cereal, cheese, yoghurt, juice, tea and coffee (no we didn't eat everything!). The extra touches include free wifi, 2 computers with internet access and printer (also free) and the excellent daily newsletter with suggestions of things to do. The inn is in a great location, less than half a block from the subway station which has the A,C,E and L lines, enabling you to travel north/south or cross town. There are plenty of good places to eat within walking distance, including the Chelsea Market, which is certainly worth a look. However, the absolute best thing about the inn is the staff and owners and in particular Jay and Al. Al is a real comedian and should have his own show. He was funny, interesting and above all helpful. We felt very at home and were made to feel really welcome. We were sorry when our week came to an end and will certainly stay here on our next trip to the city."
75,1768,"Apr 24 2009 	Still the best place to stay in New York for location character and service and value!	I last reviewed Chelsea Pines 18 months ago after a great stay. I have been back 3 times since, the latest earlier this month, and would not consider anywhere else in New York. Location is ideal, welcome is warm, rooms are character-full and clean and service is attentive. These high standards have been consistent for every visit and staying here adds a great deal to my enjoyment of my trips to New York."
76,1768,"Apr 17 2009 	Claustrophobic rooms	I was expecting a lot more based on the hotel's website. The room was pathetically small and cramped, and not exactly a great deal. I think the owners have obviously made an effort to add some charm to the place, but overall I would rather spend a little bit more money to not feel so cramped--with a queen bed, there was maybe two feet of space on either side of the bed. It felt like a narrow closet. The bed was not very comfortable despite the website proclaiming that it had been redcorated, or perhaps they missed our room&gt; It is definitely in a great location and if you're just going out all night or are 20 years old, you might not mind, but don't expect a comfortable B and B. Splurge a bit and you'll be happier."
77,1768,"Apr 16 2009 	Perfect place for NYC explorers	Me and my wife stayed at Chelsea Pines Inn for a week exploring the NYC. This hotel is probably the best bang for the buck there is in NYC. Great location, excellent staff, small but cosy rooms, service is top notch, great free breakfast, two free computers with i-net, and a nice plump cat :) . Hotel staff helped us with everything from directions to booking tickets for the phantom of the opera on Broadway. All positive but of course there are some minor cons such as small rooms, noisy pipes from time to time and you can hear the neighbors quite well, but really these tiny cons are NOT a deal breaker! Rent a room here if visiting NYC! Thank you Chelsea Pines Inn for a lovely stay!"
78,1768,"Apr 16 2009 	Our stay in this hotel was extremely fantastic	Specially the location (Chelsea, Meatpacking District and Greenwich Village on walking distance). And the subway in 14th with 8th Ave. The room was really comfortable and being a single for two was more than enough. Some other great things: the Daily News, a sheet of paper with proposals for the day and the breakfast, incredible (specially the onion's bagels and the cookies)The only thing to comment: no lift. The 5th floor is so high specially if you do long trips walking in the city."
79,1768,"Mar 22 2009 	Location location location	Our round the world trip brought us to NYC and the Chelsea Pines Inn. We booked after seeing it in the gay listings. All the rooms are named after movie stars and there are film posters everywhere. Very individual. Helpful staff including very cute guy on reception! Our room was on the 5th floor, we had four heavy bags and with no lift we got super fit! Hotel has a slightly rough around the edges feel which makes it really quite charming, Rooms immaculately clean, comfortable bed, free wifi, aircon, nice complimentary bathroom products, breakfast rather sparse but fine. Don't expect to eat healthily - bagels, cream cheese, peanut butter, muffins, doughnuts, and they could invest in a good coffee machine really which would make a big difference, Something really good is their morning newsletter pushed under the door with ideas of things to do and what's ons. It alerted us to a fantastic evening of music at a jazz theatre overlooking Central Park. Hotel a great price for NYC and it's perfectly located - right on the border of Chelsea and West Village. Lots of lovely cafes and restaurants nearby and gay nightlife close by too. We had a lovely stay."
80,1768,"Mar 20 2009 	Love this place!	I can't say enough positive things about the Chelsea Pines Inn. I've stayed there twice, and won't stay anywhere else in NYC if I can help it. The rooms are elegant, comfortable and immaculate, and the staff is stellar - so helpful and very friendly. As a woman traveling solo, it's nice to feel like the people at your hotel are keeping an eye on you and your well-being. And you can't beat the location."
81,1768,"Feb 25 2009 	Ticks all the NYC boxes	Stayed here recently for a few days with my wife and could not have picked a better location.Hotel is clean and welcoming (as are the staff !!!) and you really feel that they are going the extra mile to make your stay enjoyable. After a hard travelling around the city it is nice to come back to people welcoming you back by your first names.Location is superb with the subway so close that anywhere in Manhattan is 10 to 30 minutes away, and JFK Airport is within an hour on the Subway..The fact that CPI is on the crossroads of 4 areas is good in that you can socialise expensively or as inexpensively as you choose. From high-end Restaurants to proper Drinkers bars are all within 10 minutes walk. The lovely deli Balducci's on the corner is a good point also.To summarise if you want a quiet and friendly location that gives you quick and easy access to all that NYC has to offer, i defy you to find better value than the Chelsea Pines Inn,."
82,1768,"Feb 24 2009 	Wonderful place to stay	My friend recommended CPI for our first visit to NY. And I recommend (or will) to everyone else. The inn was perfect, went beyond our expectations. 1. Service: from the very beginning the front desk was courteous, professional, and very &quot;welcoming&quot;. Checked us in, recommended restaurants, places of interest, and how to get around town. Jay (I believe he is one of the owners) even wrote out the directions for us (no other Hotel, and we've stayed in many coming from Vegas have NEVER had anyone provide this level of service). There should be an additional star(s) for rating.2. Room: Clean, well furnished, absolutely splendid. Each room has a classic movie-star theme; I smiled, my girlfriend just went &quot;sooooo cute.&quot; Fresh towels when needed (and none of that cheap thin-rough kind). Bed was comfortable - even had an ipod station where we plugged in to listen to some tunes. Very modern, yet homey. Great lighting system (can dim to your preference). Awesome.3. Downstairs: Kitchen - clean, comfortable, and fresh bagels/muffins/orange juice in the mornings. There's a backyard for outdoor sitting, to bad it was too cold to enjoy it.4. Price: very reasonable. affordable. My friends came by to take a look at the place, and stated: &quot;Dude, you can't get a room like this anywhere in NY for the price you paid.&quot; *plus - we stayed the weekend.5. Accessibility: near the subway - just up the street.6. Location: We saw Manhattan and in all its glory. Chelsea Market right around the corner - very cool place to hang and get some great eats. Fun walk around the city. We went to union square, empire state, times square, and up to central park to check out the MET (learned a NY lingo). Basically, places of interest are very accessible from Chelsea Pines. **review was written by a third party - no gimmick - I have no affiliation whatsoever with CPI - this was an independent inquiry."
83,1768,"Feb 17 2009 	Film Nostalgia in Chelsea	I've been to the Chelsea Pines twice in the past year, once in December 2008 with my wife and once in February 2009 on my own, and had wonderful stays both times. The inn is a great location in Chelsea, a half block from the subway and walking distance from restaurants, nightlife, etc. Each of the rooms are named after a star or starlet of the silver screen (I've been in the Tony Curtis and Jeff Chandler rooms) and feature a set of vintage posters advertising their films. To top it off, the staff is amazingly helpful and friendly. With the rooms being reasonably priced for NYC, where can you go wrong?"
84,1768,"Feb 17 2009 	Best place to stay in NYC	Don't waste your time searching hours for a good quality hotel because Chelsea Pines Inn will cater for your needs. For the past 10 years that I have been traveling to New York I have continuously had the pleasure of staying at Chelsea Pines Inn. I could if I wish stay at any hotel in NYC but I like to call Chelsea Pines Inn my home from home. The basics are all covered, a clean hotel, quality furnishings, rooms are of a pleasant size with facilities such as Satellite TV, a multitude of TV channels and WiFi. Let's not forget how each room is themed on famous Hollywood names, each stylishly accessorized with original film posters depicting the star in question. Each morning a wonderful selection of muffins and other breakfast delicacies greet you including tea and coffee. The staff at Chelsea Pines Inn are fantastic, no task is too great, they are always on hand to help. The extra touches also go a long way such as a morning newsletter providing information on local events and attractions including a heads up on the weather. Luxury toiletries in the bathrooms, quality linens provided along with extra bedding if needed, some rooms equipped with a separate kitchen / seating area whilst each room in the hotel is tastefully decorated. For any visitor to New York a stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn should certainly be considered. The hotel is situated within walking distance of many attractions including SoHo, Greenwich Village, Meatpacking District and the Hudson River Park which is great for jogging enthusiasts like myself or just chilling and watching the world go by. Jay the owner alongside with Al, Rich the staff will certainly help you get the best out of your trip to NYC whilst providing you with good value, quality accommodation whom, if you are like me, will consider calling Chelsea Pines your 'second home'.Sammual James - McLoughlin"
85,1768,"Jan 21 2009 	Love this Place - Definitely will come Back	I loved this place - It was our first trip to New York, and we heard alot of mixed reviews about some of the hotels in New York.Found the Chelsea Pines inn on tripAdvisor, and I am happy to say it's a Great place to stay. We stayed in the &quot;Jeff Chandler&quot; room. Room was quite compact but really cool and well laid out and had everthing we needed, definitely added to the enjoyment of our trip. Staff are really friendly and Helpful, place is really clean... And the free buffet Breakfast is delish and a nice little perk.Really nice location, Quiet and quite central - Subway on the corner..... For when you get lazy. Love the cookies and coffee all day, another nice little perk..... Definitely will be staying here again when we are going back to New York this October."
86,1768,"Jan 17 2009 	'this is the best	The best place to stay in New York City. You don't have to look any further, this is where you want to be. Great neighbourhood, quiet garden, clean, wonderfully decorated old and new combined and best of all, the friendliest people I ever met in New York. Helpful, gracious and kind they do all they can to make you feel at home and comfortable. I came to NYC this time to accompany my daughter ... she started an international fashion course in NYC in january. Jay helped as so much to find our way, I was moved. So, I will be back with my husband, my other daughter, my friends ... As for me, I will never stay anywhere else in NYC in my life. This is a gem."
87,1768,"Jan 16 2009 	Wonderful value for money!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn the week before Christmas and we had a wonderful time! The atmosphere is very homey, complete with a friendly, cuddly cat. The staff were superb. We got a lot of help with directions and travel information, in addition to some very helpful recommendations for things to see and do. We would never have known to go to Top of the Rock instead of the Empire State Building for great panoramic views! And the pizza place they recommended was perfect. I have seen other reviewers complain that the rooms are small but look guys, this is New York and no room is going to be that big on an average person's budget. (Though the room we were in was big enough, I thought. Who needs a big room when the city is where we all want to be, anyway?) I think Chelsea Pines Inn makes up for that inevitability with little touches, like a fresh and varied breakfast menu, a daily print out of events and weather information delivered to your room, lovely, whimsical decor, and a general ambience of goodwill and hospitality. We will certainly be returning on our next trip to NYC! I've already recommended it to friends."
88,1768,"Jan 12 2009 	Loved The Fresh Bagels at the Chelsea Pines	My wife and I recently stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn and found it to be a great experience. The location is great for subway travel as well as walking to area locations. The staff was top notch and Charlie the cat added to the pleasant atmosphere. The continental breakfast which consisted of coffee, juice, fresh bagels and lox (just to name a few items) was superb and exceeded our expectations."
89,1768,"Jan 6 2009 	Giving thanks for Chelsea Pines Inn!	It was thanksgiving eve, my boyfriend and I were desperately looking for a place to stay for we had arrived in Manhattan and were victims of a scam concerning an apt. we had booked over the internet still back in Portugal!!!!New to the city, and with little hope.... a special vibe from the other side of the road caught our attention, it said: Chelsea Pines Inn.We went inside, we told our story and we were very kindly received at Chelsea! Not only we found a fantastic place in terms of neighborhood but also in terms of comfort and sympathy! We gave thanks to Chelsea Pines Inn and the great people working there! The scam ended having benefits!"
90,1768,"Jan 6 2009 	Great stay for our Honeymoon	We found Chelsea Pines on the recommendation of Pauline Frommer's NYC See More, Spend Less guide. We were beyond pleased with our choice! The location is great - just half a block from the subway station at 14th St &amp; 8th Ave. We took the subway everywhere we went, so this was a huge plus. The accomodations were kept very clean, and the room we had for most of our stay (a superior deluxe) was quite spacious. We moved to a superior standard for our last night, and even it was a pretty decent size. Both rooms had a mini-fridge, a flat screen TV, and an iPod dock on the alarm clock. Very nice! The staff was very friendly and always ready to help. And the breakfast was quite good. We ate it every day of our trip except for one. The homemade bread each morning was a special treat. I can't say enough great things about Chelsea Pines Inn - we scored a home run on this choice, and I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else in NYC. The price was an amazing value as well. Highly recommended!"
91,1768,Dec 30 2008 	Really loved this hotel during our Christmas visit to NYC	We recently stayed at this hotel and had a really great time. It is very conveniently situated and great value for money. I visit New York quite a bit and will from now on stay here!Well recommended.
92,1768,"Dec 19 2008	great location at good price	My first stay in this hotel was 4 years ago and I was nicely surprised by the recent makeover : good job!The staff was very helpful and friendly, the room was good size, with a nice and modern bathroom, the complementary breakfast was much better than average and the price for Manhattan ( Chelsea/ Meatpackers ) is a bargain ."
93,1768,"Dec 15 2008 	Very nice place to stay during visit to NYC	Very nice,charming and well-located hotel in NYC. Rooms are very nice,clean and small (but as Manhattan hotels average). Staff is correct,helpfulf and location is really great in a nice neighbourhood (safe to go out at night and very close to underground station). It is gay friendly hotel,but as we were hetero couple no problems during our stay it is open for everyone.Rooms are very original and berakfast (complete one) is included."
94,1768,"Dec 3 2008 	Great Location Wonderful bed!	Arrived on a friday evening to the Chelsea Pines Inn. At first we, my partner and I, were a little put off by the receptionist welcome, wich was a little cold. The room however was very nice. We only booked a standard room, wich was located on the 4th floor (wich is really the 3rd floor for us Europeans, so that was a nice surprise). The bed was super high and comfortable. Bathroom looked newly appointed and there was enough storage for clothes and such. The room even had a decently sized fridge. We stayed in the Jean Simmons room wich was located on the front side of the building. Although being located on a busy street we didn't have any problems with noise coming from the traffic. the room was cleaned daily and we got a change to have breakfast on saturday. The breakfast was really good, salmon, creamcheese, fresh bagels and all kinds of breads. The only thing we didn't like about breakfast was that the breakfast area did not seem to be heated. it was very cold! All the guys working there are friendly, but not overly so. So if you expect the over the top fake &quot;hi how are you, you look so nice&quot;etc. etc. this is not your place. The people are friendly but real! Great!The Inn is in a really really good location! Close to a main subwaystop and on the edge of Chelsea, Meetpaking District and The Village. You are right smack in the middle of all the action, wich was great as we liked to explore NY's nightlife.All in all we had a really nice stay here and were feeling a bit sorry when we left. We will surely return to the Chelsea Pines Inn next time we are in NY."
95,1768,"Nov 10 2008	Good location	For ease of getting around NYC Chelsea Pines Inn is in a great location, there are a number of subway lines servicing different parts of Manhattan. Overall though we can't help being disappointed in the overall experience. Our room on the second floor was excessively small (even by NYC standards), and with nowhere to store suitcases that left little room to move. I read previously that they had been refurbished but I think this room must have missed out. The room was stuffy and drab, and the hot water in the shower unreliable. Being right on W14th Street also means garbage trucks and sirens 24/7. The staff were functional but not overly friendly (not even a token offer to help carry a bag upstairs?), which we found odd having stayed at other much friendlier g&amp;l accommodations. For US$239 per night if you look hard enough there are nicer places to stay in the area for the same money."
96,1768,"Nov 3 2008 	Adorable Inn and a Great Location	The Chelsea Pines Inn is adorable, has a great location for walking or hopping the subway, and is very reasonably priced. Rooms are on the small side, but the sheets and towels are great. The staff is super!"
97,1768,"Oct 24 2008 	Perfect hotel in the perfect location	My husband and I spent three nights at the Chelsea PInes Inn, on a long weekend break to New York - we loved it and heartily recommend it. The location is perfect if you want to be in walking distance of all the major sights of Manhattan, but away from the tourist rabble and high rise madness of midtown. The location between the Chelsea neighbourhood above, the Meatpacking district next door, and Greenwich Village just below is great for strolling to lovely restaurants and bars in the evening and experiencing a bit more of 'local life'.We stayed in 'Albert Finney' room which was located on the ground floor, so no stairs, and right by the complimentary hot drinks and cookies available all day until 11pm - perfect as I am six months pregnant! The room was spacious, the bed super comfy, and the bathroom well equipped, clean and stylish. We loved our visits from Charlie Chaplin, the resident cat.The staff are what really make the hotel special for New York - nothing was too much trouble, and they were really friendly without being at all intrusive - they struck the right balance. Each morning you get 'Chelsea Morning' delivered under your door which is a selection of suggestions of what's on that day in the city - a nice touch to peruse as you're enjoying the yummy complimentary breakfast including home made bread and the world's largest bagels. We'll be back!"
98,1768,"Oct 23 2008	Great Stay	Great hotel, very nice room, good breakfast. Great service and a fantastic connection to the public transportation. We will stay at this hotel all the times we travel to New York in the future. Peter and Kiki"
99,1768,"Oct 23 2008 	What a gem!	A friend at the Times suggested two places; my wife and I opted for Chelsea after checking their websites and some other reviews. The owner and staff were fantastic! Given our length of stay (10 d); our request for 'quiet'; and our ages (60s), we were assigned the Doris Day room, and survived a hike up a couple of flights of stairs to a quiet, clean, and commodious (by NY stds) room. Need tickets? No problem! They found excellent seats for Miller's 'All my sons' and 'Spring Awakening' at half price; suggested excellent restaurants nearby; always responded to our requests. The breakfast repast was always very good, including lox and cheese on a couple of days. All in all, we would not hesitate to recommend this spot to others, or stay there again. Great location, great digs, great people. Oh, and a bit of a warning. This place is not perfect, but then, there's always the Waldorf! Personally, we prefer the Chelsea."
100,1768,"Oct 20 2008	In a league of its own	I booked this hotel solely on the basis of reviews read here. We stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn for 6 nights in late Sept./early October. We are two couples in our fifties. We had rooms on the second floor with bathroom. The staff were either very helpful and friendly OR just did their job efficiently, which was great. I expected small rooms (this not being my first time in NYC) but they were a bit smaller than expected. Beds, linens, towels, hot water, breakfast all good. We were very happy. Location was great. Particularly enjoyed the very warm weather and eating breakfast in the courtyard behind the dining area. I would like to make one suggestion to the owners: Due to your very small rooms ( I think ours was superior standard - Susan Hayward) and very high ceilings, perhaps you could give some thought to adding a couple of hooks in each room and/or putting up a shelf to take advantage of the vertical space you have. Due of the small amount of floor space it was difficult to keep the floor clear of clutter. I would recommend this hotel to others and would return again. Thanks for a great stay in NYC.Susan Deevy"
101,1768,"Oct 18 2008 	Excellent location and helpful staff!	Excellent location and helpful staff! Chelsea Pines is a great place to rest your head during you New York visit. Located 3 stops from Time Square, walking distance to the Meat Packing district and Greenwich Village. Very central, great for tourists. The staff is also very friendly and kind, helping us make the most of our visit. They offered excellent dining recommendations and assisted with all of our &quot;tourist&quot; needs. The owner is a gem! :)"
102,1768,"Oct 16 2008 	Home away from home	If you like spending time in Chelsea, the Village and the Meat Packing District, this is your best choice. Great price and the friendliest staff in town...and an adorable house cat. Very nice selection for the complimentary breakfast. The rooms are small and you'll need to climb stairs, but if you are up for that, look no further. We'll be back soon!"
103,1768,"Oct 1 2008 	Good location nice staff but overall disappointing	the hotel is in a great location and the staff were very nice. however, i couldn't help but be a little bit disappinted by the whole experience. i think some rooms have been refurbished (the reception definitely looks nice and new), but ours certainly wasn't. we stayed in the lesley caron room on the top floor and while it was okay, it was just that, okay. while the room was reasonably clean, the decor is a bit old and drab (especially the sink area - the mini fridge was ancient! we had to unplug it complained so much!). the shower kept going from hot to cold, the air conditioning made a clunking noise that made a good night's sleep impossible (and if you open the window you get lots of traffic noise form 14th street, plus mosquitos). our room wasn't cleanred one day at all. so all in all it was ok and since prices in NY are so crazy probably good value for money (even though it's not cheap at all), but we won't stay here again."
104,1768,"Sep 23 2008 	RECOMMENDED !!!!	Tripadvisor member Antwerp/BelgiumWe enjoyed our stay in this hotel very much!!The location is just exelent with the subways nearbye .We will book in this hotel again but probably ask for a room not higher than the third floor, due to lack of an alivator.The room and the bathroom is clean and the bed comfortable.The staff is very friendly and will not hesitate to help you to book an event or explaine how to get somewhere .And...... they serve breakfast !!!"
105,1768,"Sep 23 2008 	Plesant friendly comfortable	Chelsea Pines Inn is a small hotel with a few limitations because of its size and the age of the building.  First the one con: No elevator.Now the pros: You get a considerable discount for staying on one of the upper floors.The staff is among the most helpful and friendly at any hotel I have stayed at in NYC. They try to accommodate every request, will reserve restaurants for you, book theater tickets and find discounts if any are available, and finally book a cab to get you back to the airport when you leave. And you wont want to leave, they really make your stay special, and their assistance in getting around the city and finding things to do is pricelessThe rooms are well appointed, but a bit small, as to be expected at an older NYC hotel. All the rooms are non-smoking rooms, but there is a small outside area where you can smoke. Our room was cleaned daily and was always fresh. Apparently each one is named after a movie star, and ours was decorated with posters featuring that star. I believe that the posters are originals, not copies.Breakfast was self-serve continental with breads, pastries, cereals, juice, coffee, tea, etc. Unlike some places they kept it open until around 11AM, which was great as we were out late every day and got up late. Coffee was available all the time.While not cheap by most standards, the price was much less than any other place we looked at in the area, so I guess it was a bargain but, boy, are hotel rooms pricy in NYC. We will definitely stay here for our next visit to New York."
106,1768,"Sep 23 2008 	Fantastic find in New York !!	I thought I would let you all know that there is a wonderful hotel in New York in the fashionable Chelsea area of the Meat Packing District. The staff are brilliant (especially Shaun, Daniel and Al) and were always so helpful and polite. The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and recently refurbished to a lovely standard. We had a great time in New York and they made that stay even better, nothing was too much trouble. In the past this hotel has been predominantly known for it's high percentage of gay guests and while they still do have some gay paying guests they have all other types of couples too, myself and my Husband was there with my In laws and their were varied types of couples staying and of all ages, so please do not stereotype your thinking because you will be missing out on a great place to stay when in New York.Keep it up guys - this is what hotels are supposed to be like ....."
107,1768,"Sep 8 2008 	Great location not so great hotel	We stayed here in August 2008, and we loved the location. The hotel is just near a subway station and a few minutes walk away from the West Village, wich we LOVED. There are some great restaurants and shops in the area. But the hotel itself couldn't live up to our expectations. The owner, Jay, was really nice and helpfull but all of the other staff seemed bored, weren't really helpfull and didn't have humor AT ALL. Also, there was only cold water coming out of the shower in the mornings. Because of that, they gave us our last night free of charge, that was really nice. The rooms weren't always cleaned and sometimes there was an ackward smell in the small room. All in all, it was an OK hotel, on a great location. If we could come to NY again, I think we would go to another hotel."
108,1768,"Aug 19 2008 	Great location!	Hotel is in a very good location - away from all the tourist traps. Close to Union Square and the Meat Packing District and Balducci's is right around the corner (excellent meat deli there by the way). The rooms are okay - nothing special and not always the cleanest either (in our experience). There were days when the toilet wasn't cleaned and I don't think they even look under the bed (so maybe you shouldn't either). The breakfast area is a nice touch (especially the courtyard at back) and most of the staff are pretty friendly. Not sure if I'd stay here again, maybe for one or two nights max. Not terrible but nothing too special either."
109,1768,"Aug 19 2008 	Chelsea Pines made our stay	Chelsea Pines was amazing. The rooms were fun, spacious enough for two and the staff was very accommodating. The continental breakfast was great each day, they offered a plethora of food/drinks which included fresh fruit, bagels, donuts, cereal, juices, hot tea, coffee. Charlie, the resident feline, was an absolute sweetheart and a bit of a ham. Great value, clean rooms, fantastic Manhattan location (subway right on the corner.....another subway with a lot of other lines at union square was only a few blocks down 14th). It's really hard for me to sum how impressed we were in words. Staying at Chelsea Pines really did make our trip. I will say right now that the Inn is not suitable for all types! There are a lot of stairs if you have a top floor room and there is no elevator/lift. This was not a problem for me but if you do not like stairs or cannot easily get up stairs on your own, this may not be the place for you. As for the man with the newborn, a stay here may have been do-able for your family but it certainly would have been difficult. I'm sure the staff was trying to inform you of that before you came to stay. They were MORE than helpful if I ever had a question (or needed a roll of toilet paper!)."
110,1768,"Aug 17 2008 	Great place to stay in NYC	A cosy, comfortable and clean litle hotel with a great location close to wherever you want to go as a tourist. Me and my three friends stayed for four nights and where very pleased with everything; the rooms were clean, the service was great, breakfast was good. I have recommended Chelsea Pines Inn too all my friends going to NYC and I will definately stay there myself next time i go!"
111,1768,"Aug 12 2008 	Great hotel worthy of its rating on here	I chose the Chelsea Pines Inn for the New York leg of my honeymoon trip after reading such good reviews of it on Trip Advisor. We stayed for four nights, and I was really pleased with the choice that I made.We stayed in the Lee Remick room, which was clean and very comfortable, and like all the rooms at the hotel had cool movie posters for decoration. It was on the fourth floor with a nice view of the street; as other reviewers have mentioned, there is no lift at this hotel, so there were quite a lot of stairs to climb, but I was aware of that in advance so it was fine. The street wasn't particularly noisy, and as we were up quite high we were never bothered by the traffic.It was very hot and humid in the city during our stay, but the air conditioning worked very well and so it was very pleasant in our room. Breakfast was nice, kind of American/continental with a range of muffins and bagels, breads, cereals, etc. You could also get tea, coffee, ice and cookies from the breakfast area at any time during the day, which meant you didn't miss having tea-making facilities in your room.The hotel was very quiet, I don't think they encourage children there, which suited us very well. I heard no noise from any other rooms, or even from people passing in the corridor.The staff were lovely and very helpful. We had no problems at all with arriving late (about 9pm), and they were able to give us lots of useful information on where to go and what to do in the city.My only criticism would be that our room often wasn't made up until about 4pm, which meant when we came back in the afternoon we sometimes had to wait while they finished it. This wasn't really a problem, and might have been because they start on the lower floors and work up. We never had to wait more than about 15 minutes anyway, so by the time we'd got a drink downstairs it was fine.The location is good as it is close to a subway station, and if you don't mind walking you can get to Times Square in about half an hour. There are lots of restaurants nearby, and the gay bars of Chelsea and the West Village are within easy walking distance.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel, and if I came back to New York would definitely try to book here again. It really does deserve all the good reviews it's had on here.Thank you Chelsea Pines!"
112,1768,"Aug 3 2008 	Its great	I stayed at the chelsea pines for one week with my best mate, we are from england!The general areas of the hotel are exremely clean and fresh, the breakfast was good - self service in kitchen to the rear of the property.We stayed in a budget room, and each room is based upon a theatre show I think.......our room had a big yellow stripe thing accross the wall from memory, Yellow brick road??.The staff were very polite and really helpful. We spoke at length to one of them (blonde, 40's, skinny) and he was always answering our questions.Its location is good, a 20 minute walk into town, and the hotel are always happy to book your taxi's for airport runs etc.Would recommend it no problem"
113,1768,"Jul 18 2008 	Chelsea Pines Inn is a great little hotel with a fantastic location	We stayed for a week last June. The hotel is truly wonderful, great rooms decorated with a movie theme (every room a different moviestar, very funny). The rooms are large for NY. Our room was on the backside and it was absolutely QUIET, really great.One of the best things about the hotel is its location... First of all, it is on the edge of Chelsea and West Village, close to the hip Meatpacking district (there's even an Apple Store on the corner!), so there's plenty to do and see, and even more to eat... But equally important, it is literally 2 minutes from a subway station that has lines both going north-south but also east-west, which means that it becomes really easy to go anywhere in Manhattan really quick. Jay Lesiger, the owner and a very nice man, gave us the great suggestion to get a 1-week metro card for $25... Outstanding value. And Jay will prove to be a great help in pointing out things to do, see and eat in the area and the city. I truly recommend the Chelsea Pines Hotel for anyone who would like something else than a Times Square Large Impersonal Hotel Chain Hotel.Mike from Belgium"
114,1768,"Jul 17 2008	No CHILDREN Wanted	I was planning a stay in New York with my wife and newborn baby. I read the wonderful reviews at the reasonably prices hotel. However, when I called I was told the hotel &quot;was not suitable&quot; for children or infants under 16 years old. I did not quite understand so I asked and was told that the &quot;hallways were not very wide, the bathrooms were small, and the building did not have an elevator.&quot; WOW, I did not know that newborns needed these amenities. ONLY IN NYC!"
115,1768,"Jun 26 2008 	Gem in NYC!	We just returned from an overnight at The Chelsea Pines in in NYC. We were attending a concert at the Hiro Ballroom in The Maritime Hotel, and couldn't afford a room there. So we started doing some research to find something more reasonable. We came across CPI from a map-quest search for hotels close to the concert venue. The Hotel was spotless, very tasteful, exceptionally welcoming (a plus for us, since we don't know NYC very well, and felt a little overwhelmed). Each room has a movie star theme. But it's nothing gaudy or tacky. In our room (we stayed in Room 135, the Tony Curtis room) there was a Tony Curtis gold star on the door, and it was decorated with very cool, framed movie posters from his films. The bed was very comfy, the AC worked perfectly, the towels were heavenly, the toiletries were exceptional, the room was clean and comfortable, there was a safe and a fridge, very nice TV with cable, and free wi-fi access. Some rooms (the Economy rooms) share a toilet but have privates showers. Our room was a Deluxe Superior, and had a complete private bathroom. Your stay includes a great continental breakfast in a cute kitchen area, and you have access to coffee, tea, cookies, etc at all hours. Also, there is a cute veranda for outdoor seating. I should mention that while NYC is obviously noisy, the CPI was totally quiet from the moment we walked in the front door. I don't know if it's a noise-proof door, or what, but we were very impressed. Our room was equally quiet, although we were aware of people using the hallway toilets during the night. The CPI is also easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants, bars, and shops. We were disappointed we only had one night there!The Chelsea Pines Inn is a gay hotel, although they welcome all orientations. My husband and I (obviously not gay) felt completely comfortable and welcomed by everyone we encountered. We will absolutely stay at The Chelsea Pines Inn again when we make it back to NYC!"
116,1768,Jun 23 2008 	Absolutely amazing!!!!	What a fantastic little hotel! The staff were very friendly - you might be mistaken to think you were somewhere else but New York! The room was spacious and clean. The breakfast was good and the all day coffee and cookies was a nice treat. The subway is also very close to the hotel. I stayed here for four nights that seemed to go by so quickly. I will definitely be back here again soon!
117,1768,"Jun 19 2008 	great stay	Ideal location, very very close to subway station, breakfast provided for free, room very small but doable for a few nights, and to be expected from new york. Staff very friendly and helpful."
118,1768,"Jun 18 2008	It was GREAT!	NYC - thought I'd hate it. Went with my wife for a gallery opening.surprisingly, the city was good. The hotel was great. very accommating, helpful, close to subway + galleries+ good restrauants, etc.When we go back, we'll stay here again."
119,1768,"Jun 18 2008 	What a delight!	We stayed nine nights at Chelsea Pines, so we had ample opportunity to experience the many facets of hotel life. The quiet, pleasant, respectful atmosphere of the hotel made it a nice place to &quot;come home to.&quot; With excellent access to all lines on the subway, Broadway and the Financial District are no more than 15 minutes away. Two blocks away on 9th Ave. are many of the hottest night spots in the city, but Chelsea Pines remains a calm amidst the storm. We loved the neighborhood away from the roaring madness of Times Square, but with easy access if we chose to go there. I can't say that I loved climbing two flights of stairs, but it was good for me, and having Charlie the Cat greet us during most trips made the climb a little more effortless. The staff offered help with luggage, so that was not a problem. The movie theme of each room is playful and adds to the ambience. The rooms were spotless each day, and the staff was quick to offer help with any needs."
120,1768,"Jun 17 2008 	Good location; value	To give some frame of reference for my review: When my wife and I travel (especially in Europe) we tend to stay in small hotels and pensions independently owned and without most amenities. That is the type of establishment to expect with the Chelsea Pines Inn. It is run by a friendly staff that happily held our bags while we explored the city and immediately addressed any small concerns that arose. The hotel is located in Chelsea less than a block from a subway station (A, C, E and L lines) and within an easy walk to Greenwich Village and Soho. The breakfast mainly consisted of breads, bagels and the like with coffee milk and juice but the all-day cookie jars as well as a welcome candy dish added a nice touch of hospitality. Before I go any further I should mention that we stayed in their least expensive room on the 5th floor. That is important for two reasons: One, the hotel has no elevator. After a day of walking the steps are not nearly as welcome as the candy dish. Second, as we walked past rooms being cleaned many looked cleaner, larger and more well kept than ours. That being said it does seem fair to judge a hotel based on the accommodations they offer and ours were slightly below average in terms of cleanliness, decor and comfort for this type of hotel when compared to other cities (this was my first time at this type of hotel within the City so I have no direct comparison). The lobby and the convention of naming rooms after old Hollywood stars implies a hip atmosphere that got nowhere near our room. Institutional green walls and an old flat-pack cabinet were the interior decorating. But again, we didn't have to spend much money, the place felt safe, the staff was friendly and we didn't vacation in New York to hang out in our hotel room. When all is said and done it did the job as well as was needed."
121,1768,"Jun 9 2008 	Home away from home at the Chelsea Pines Inn	The Chelsea Pines Inn, wonderfully located on West 14th St in NYC, has got all the details right. The staff are personable and friendly, yet there is a sense of valued privacy for all. The rooms have movie star themes (for instance, I was in the Kim Novack room), complete with movie posters and a star on the door. Towells are thick, beds are very comfortable, the lighting is flatteringly adjustable, and the vintage of the building allows great audial privacy (thick walls and floors). In other hotels, I can often hear my neighbors sneeze, shower, etc.It is a walk up (no lift), so do be prepared to schlep your bags up the stairs. Coffee and freshly baked breads are offered each morning. An amusing and informative news sheet (Chelsea Morning News) is slipped under your door each dawn with all the current details of importance: weather, local eating/drinking/gathering establishments, events in the city. I found this daily missive a very thoughtful touch.The location is ideal: close to subways, easy walking distance to Chelsea, Greenwich Village, Chelsea Piers. There is even a movie star cat, Charlie Chaplin (in black and white only)!"
122,1768,"May 31 2008 	Great stay!	We loved our stay in the Chelsea Pines Inn. It is in a convenient part of town (on 14th Street between 8th and 9th Aves) within walking distance of Soho, Greenwich Village etc and very close to a subway stop. The hotel itself is clean and our room (the Ann-Margret room) had everything we needed: safe, ironing board, aircon, ipod charger etc. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the complimentary breakfast was a bonus. The only downside was the staircase - be prepared to trudge up the stairs with your luggage unless you request &amp; pay more for a lower floor! Overall though we had a great stay for the price, and would stop here again."
123,1768,"May 28 2008 	Perfect Value Perfect Place	This place is amazing. We just stayed in the Tony Curtis room. It had a bathroom and was very clean and wonderful. The directions to and from the Inn were helpful and it's centrally located and easy to get to. I found all the staff friendly and helpful. We had a lot of great recommendations for restaurants and things to do. The continental breakfast was a life-saver and very hearty and good. The rooms are small, but we didn't mind that. They were really clean, however, and there was air conditioning that worked well along with big windows that opened. Our room was on the 2nd floor in the back and really perfect. We had a view of the garden and it was quiet and really wonderful. We were sad to come home! We'll definately return again."
124,1768,May 9 2008 	Lovely Hotel in the Heart of The City	This hotel is such good value and much better than the traditional tourist hotels. The location is excellent and you actually feel that you are staying in the real NY. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable and the staff were very friendly and helpful. One minor complaint was a lack of breakfast one morning but this is easily forgiven considering the selection every other day. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to stay in a small comfortable hotel at a great value price.
125,1768,"Apr 26 2008 	A Bargain at Twice the Price	CPI is my favorite inn in NYC. Everyone is welcome and the diversity of visitors having morning coffee in the breakfast room can be as interactive of an event as you want -- there's no forcing of dialogue as in some B&amp;Bs. Fresh pastry and bagels are brought in every morning and it's well attended to by staff; therefore there aren't crumbs, banana peels, and used mugs ever competing for space at a table. The owner, Jay, even makes fresh bread every morning.The staff is extremely kind, generous, and helpful and the rooms are elegant in their simplicity and clean clean clean. The neighborhood is full of restaurants and conveniences and the property is less than a block away from the subway. CPI is a wonderful place to call home in the city -- and upon returning from a day at work or touring, there are chocolates, cookies, and tea. There is no elevator, so if you have a lot of luggage, the staff will assist (or if you carry your own bags this can ameliorate any guilt after discovering those bottomless cookie and chocolate jars). I've stayed in almost every room in the inn, and each one is a retro treat with movie posters from ages past. Rooms facing the street have white noise machines, which block well most ambient noise. The guest rooms across from the bathrooms can be a bit noisy, though, but it is overall a very quiet inn that's personalized but not intrusive in its service."
126,1768,"Apr 19 2008 	Excellent location good value neutral service	The location, at the confluence of two or three intriguing neighborhoods, spitting distance from subway stations...is ideal. It was even pretty quiet at night (our room did not face the street). The patrons were all grown-up well-behaved types, so no partying sounds. A local daycare lets the kids out to play at about 9AM -- it's a nice noise to wake up to.I think they may have remodeled recently, as I did not notice any of the shabbiness that previous reviewers mentioned. (My husband did say he thought it was a little rough around the edges, though.) Yes, when you enter the lobby there is a little mustiness -- I think there may be dryers on site that don't vent so well, though I'm not sure. But the upstairs rooms (climbing 5 flights a few times a day is not bad as long as you know what you're in for) were bone dry.There were great elements -- quality beds, excellent sheets. Mini-fridge without any of the usual expensive impulse snacks. Varied fare at the continental breakfast. Thoughtful listing of three events/locations of note, slipped by elves under the door each night.There were some lacks -- no hooks, towel racks, or phone books. Not a big deal, but those things would have made an extended stay a little easier for us. Small spaces, of course, so there was some creative bathroom fixture placement -- don't be too obese if you expect fit in certain important bathroom niches!The guys who cleaned the rooms were friendly and genuine. The guys who worked the desk were unfailingly polite, patient and helpful. In general, though, there was not a warm vibe. It was kind of like -- efficient waiters. Which some guests will be very happy with, certainly. But I see that at least one other previous reviewer noted there is little chatter between guests, or between guests and staff. Maybe this is just NYC, and I'm a closet Minnesotan? I think that the campy decor made me expect a little more...chatty, casual interaction, human warmth, give and take, laughter.One owner went out of his way to help us once. The other owner, well -- he made me feel as if I was in his way during his day at his hotel, a few times. Like I was in his living room.In general, I would describe the tenor of the service as reserved...or standoffish, depending on what you like for interaction during your vacation.It did bother me a little that no women seemed to work at the hotel. It was not an *exclusively* gay male clientele, so why the apparent lack of women employees?Definitely book a stay if you want a decent value at a great location, a seamless NYC stay. After all, who wants to spend much time in the hotel room in that city? I'd think twice if you are a single person travelling alone, wanting to make friendly connections with people. Go to Toronto :)"
127,1768,"Mar 24 2008 	Great Hotel	We stayed here for a short break and I would highly recommend it. The complimentry brekkie in the morning is a nice touch and a great way to mingle with the other travellers.Its not as central as you would like if you are looking to be in the middle of it all. But it has an underground station just on the corner so your set for transport. The hotel itself is lovely the rooms are snug but clean. The guy on reception his name was Rickie Poe, hope I have the spelling right was a real character so friendly and was great for information, he really made our stay in the little jewel called Chelsea Pines well worth it."
128,1768,"Mar 17 2008 	So pleased I stayed here	I stayed here for 3 nights in March &amp; booked this hotel after reading the positive reports on Trip. I was travelling alone &amp; had friends staying in a nearby hotel.I have asked permission of those named below to include them by name.I arrived after 7pm &amp; was warmly welcomed by Richard. Thank you. I was on the 2nd floor in the 'Troy Donahue' room which was facing the street. The room was clean &amp; quirky with huge posters. I had chosen a room with sink &amp; shower but without toilet. The loo was just along the corridor &amp; I never saw anyone else go in or out. It suited me fine.The bed was very large &amp; very comfy. The only slight drawback was that as the bed was so large it was near the far end wall &amp; I had to siddle past. Having said that it was great to have a big bed.The shower was efficient &amp; towels replaced daily as needed. The complimentary toiletries were most welcome.The breakfasts were good &amp; set me up for the day. There was a choice of orange juice, coffee, various teas, 2 types of cereal, fruit, muffins, doughnuts, bagels &amp; cookies. The plates were fab. All themed around filmstars &amp; movies. I'm a saddo &amp; I took photos of my plates each day having chosen different ones each morning.My friend arrived to collect me on the first morning &amp; I had asked Richard the night before if it would be ok if my friend had a coffee &amp; cookie with me, I would happily pay if he would added it to my bill. He said there was no need &amp; my friend would be welcome. What a warm gesture &amp; much appreciated.Each evening when I returned to the hotel Richard was on duty &amp; we had great chats. He was really helpful over all sorts of info I wanted to know. Thank you again.The other guests were quiet but we passed the time of day.On the last morning I went to reception to ask if I could check in for my flight. Ric (not Richard) was on duty, I hadn't met him before. Another total sweetie. He happily helped me to check in using his computer &amp; then printed off the confirmation sheet for me at no cost.I also met Jay, the owner, on my last morning, again another really warm helpful guy. When I was ready to leave, he helped me with my bags &amp; hailed a cab for me. Thank you.I really appreciated the warmth shown to me by Richard, Ric &amp; Jay. They made a good stay GREAT!I would return. The location was excellent with the subway at the end of the street, a minute walk away. All the cab drivers knew of the location which is a bonus.If you like a good location &amp; quirkiness then stay here. There was redecoration going on but every establishment has to maintain a property. It didn't interfer with my stay at all."
129,1768,"Mar 17 2008 	would not again	I've stayed at a few gay hotels: Barcelona, Phoenix, San Francisco, and they all had more atmosphere than this one. If I had it to do over again, I would stay at one of the hotels in the area that lists itself as gay friendly. I feel as though I paid for the privilege of being in a gay-owned hotel -- like it was a tax.Granted, the guy at the desk upon arrival was very welcoming, even entertaining. I had the Rock Hudson room on the 5th floor. Didn't mind the climb but didn't much appreciate each day having to step over the vacuum cleaner stored right outside my door. And gazing at the extension ladder hung on the stairwell wall. I think, for the price, there are better places.As for it being a gay hotel, compared to the others where I've stayed, this one didn't have much gay atmosphere. Other than the 4 friends I traveled with (and we stayed there on the high recommendation of one of them), no one else seemed interested in engaging in any conversation or even acknowledgement.As in another review, the Rock Hudon room had a double bed up against the window and a single against the wall. I used the single as a suitcase rack but the double/single combination reminded me of some inexpensive family rooms one would find in London or other parts of Europe... a bit like a dorm room. In all fairness, no street noise though.My biggest complaint (we were there in hot, early September) was the the air con unit sump pump kicking on and off with a thud every 30 seconds or so, and, even when I turned my unit off, the unit for the next room over still clicked on and off noticeably all night long. Mentioning this to the front desk got absolutely no acknowledgement other than: Yeah, that's the air con unit. Others have mentioned it, too. Too much money for no atmosphere."
130,1768,Mar 13 2008 	Loved it!	What a sweet hotel! The staff were so helpful and friendly and we loved the bagel breakfast. Our room was spacious and funky - only problem was that the shower cubicle leaked a bit and made the room smell a bit damp. Otherwise we loved the area too and found it very convenient for Greenwich and other cool areas. Would deffo stay here again.
131,1768,Mar 7 2008 	Great Place	we were recommended the chelsea pines by two friends who are regular guests - it was really superb. Greta location for subway to all parts of NY as well as being close to the Village and Chelsea districts.The room was great - lots of space (we had a superior deluxe on 2nd floor) The staff were all friendly and the inclusive breakfast and all day coffee and cookies was a nice touch.Will definately return
132,1768,"Feb 28 2008 	Would Return	My bf and i stayed in dec last year and was very happy with everything apart from Housekeeping as our Deluxe room was only cleaned twice in a week.The other problem was the noise if you stay on the ground floor,we had the Albert Finney room next to the Kitchen and the staff are very noisy at midnight banging plates and getting breakfast ready and then again each morning was noisy.The room was clean shabby chic. Bathroom was boiling all the time but clean and nice.Nice tvnice wardrobe but small and with all our shopping we soon packed the room full of all those bargains.Never had breakfast only the odd cookie and tea.we are returning again this dec 2008 as it was all in all pretty great.Staff were friendly."
133,1768,"Feb 17 2008 	Brilliant!	We stayed for five nights in the Chelsea Pines Inn for our first trip to New York. We were given a warm welcome and love our 'Tony Curtis' themed bedroom. Facilities were clean, staff were very friendly and the breakfast was great. I would recommend this place to anyone! Reasonably priced for a great location and fantastic service!"
134,1768,"Jan 10 2008 	Great hotel great location lovely breakfast	I stayed here in Nov/Dec 2007 with a group of friends and my husband. We were in the Debbie Reynolds room on the 3rd floor. The room was warm, a fairly decent size (for NYC!), and the bathroom was really nice. Rooms were cleaned daily and you also got a newsletter giving ideas of things to do every day. The breakfasts were sensational: Huge muffins, bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, yogurts, tea/coffee, doughnuts - very delicious and filling. Tea/coffee and cookies were also available all day, which was nice when you came in from a long day's shopping. The guys who own the hotel were really friendly, and gave some great recommendations for restaurants in the area. A couple of the staff weren't so helpful, but on the whole I found them pretty good. The hotel's location is really great - right on the corner of 8th Av and 14th St - really handy for the subway and shopping. We had friends in a 3 person room on the 4th floor, which was also pretty nice, and a deluxe room on the 5th floor, which had a separate area with a table and a much bigger bedroom. The stairs were quite a challenge with the suitcases, but really not an issue - you need something to help you work off the breakfast every day!This was my second trip to NYC, and I think that value-for-money wise you really can't do much better than this place."
135,1768,"Dec 26 2007 	A little rough round the edges but charming with it	My boyfriend and I had 4 nights in the Chelsea Pines at the end of a 2 1/2 month roadtrip round the US. Our dream had been to end the trip in style with a luxury stay in a trendy NY boutique hotel, but lack of funds and the mistake of arriving the day after Thanksgiving somewhat put paid to that. We had a lot of trouble even finding a hotel that had rooms for less than $300 a night but luckily the Chelsea Pines came to the rescue. We had 2 nights in an 'Economy' room on the 4th floor and then switched to a more expensive room on the 5th floor. The Economy room was adequate although pretty cramped and a little frayed around the edges. The worst thing was the shower curtain which looked as if it had been there, unwashed, for a good few years - in which time it had got pretty stained and mouldy at the bottom! The room decor was also a little random although we loved the film posters (a theme which is continued throughout the hotel). The skirting boards and the sides of cupboards all had metal checkerboard which is an unusual style of decor to say the least! The more luxurious room we had for the last two nights was great - much more spacious with a separate, tiled entrance area off of which was the bathroom, and much nicer decor and furnishings overall. Being on the 5th floor though it did take it out of us getting up and down those stairs.The communal areas of the inn did suffer slightly from being a little shabby and not quite as clean as you might expect - they had a bit of a musty smell which may have been down to the resident cat. However the breakfast area was very nice and as the other reviewers have said, a decent spread for brekkie, with great movie themed plates! Staff were on the whole friendly and helpful, especially the managers. One or two of the more junior staff were a little surly but we put it down to the early starts. Overall the whole atmosphere was very laid back and guests are left to their own devices.The fantastic location is the best thing of all about the inn, with a subway station practically next door, and Chelsea, Soho, the Village, Meatpacking district etc all short walks away. Some great thai restaurants up 8th Ave and great bars and pricier restaurants in the Meatpacking.Overall we had a pleasant time here and the friendliness and location made up for the slightly ramshackle nature of the place."
136,1768,"Dec 21 2007 	Great location 	Stayed here for 5 nights in December. We stayed in the Rock Hudson room on the top (5th) floor, which was a bit of a slog even without luggage! It was one of the deluxe rooms, and I think the reason for this was the space really. It had a double &amp; a single bed, the typical quirky film-related decor as has been mentioned, a flat-screen TV and an ipod dock. There was also a fridge in the hallway which we didn't use but could be handy. The room was nice, comfortable and felt spacious. It was front-facing though so we bought earplugs as not used to city noise! If you were in one of the rooms at the back you would probably be fine though. The bathroom could have done with a bit of renovation but I'm sure the owners know that. It was all a bit old &amp; worn, although everything worked fine. I wouldn't really have wanted to take a bth though. Breakfast was good with plenty of variety and plenty of everything!The staff were friendly, particularly the managers/owners. We did ask one guy about the best way to get to Newark (we had arrived at JFK) and he was spectacularly unhelpful, but went back later when one of the managers was on the desk and he was very helpful and booked a Carmel car to take us there.As everyone has said, the location is excellent, very near the subway and places to eat. Less than 10 minutes from Bleecker street. If you're looking for places to eat nearby, the Italian they recommend is good (and good value), as is the Spanish resturant Centro Nacional down the street, and Mi Cocina on Jane Street (7 mins away).Only criticism - could be a bit cleaner. I think they need a new vacuum cleaner as theirs isn't really doing the best job!All in all, I would say for the space you get, breakfast &amp; location, plus the relaxed &amp; friendly atmosphere, it's great value."
137,1768,"Dec 9 2007	kept me toasty in chilly NYC	I just got back from a 5 night stay at Chelsea Pines and really liked it. The service was really wonderful, the bed comfy, and there was no chance we would be cold on those 20 degree evenings as the room was always warm and the bed sufficiently dressed. Perfect location, entertaining decor, great TV selection. Subway access was jut a few steps away, as well as a Balducci's for all our gourmet snacking needs. Chelsea market also at the opposite end of the block. Neighborhood was excellent and a short walk to the West Village and Magnolia Bakery.Would stay again and recommend it to like-minded casual laid back NYC visitors.Oh - and Charlie the cat was a sweetheart!"
138,1768,"Dec 4 2007 	A Good Deal for NYC but Average	I was in New York City for a couple of days to see friends and I was looking for a place @ $200-250 that was clean and comfortable. My room at the Chelsea Pines was reasonably cute; it looked like a tiny East Village studio, minus kitchen. I never quite felt comfortable there, though. The carpet wasn't quite clean enough for me to walk around barefoot, the bed was obviously years old, though not horrendously uncomfortable. The hotel does however have an exceptional location, near many subway lines. After this experience I realize that on my next trip to New York I need to bite the bullet and pay $300+ for a room in which I will feel comfortable."
139,1768,"Nov 24 2007 	enjoyed and wud stay again	we stayed 9 nov for 4 nights, having booked directly with the hotel, the staff where really helpful and when i emailed them prior to staying asking for some advice they responded straight away. during our stay they continued to be really helpful and always acknowledged us when we were coming and going.we stayed on the 3rd floor [which made me out of breath each time but i knew that when i booked it], the staff took our bags up and brought them down at the end of our stay. the room was nice, a fridge which was really useful because there is a amazing deli on the corner! a little noisy but so is everywhere in NYThe location, brilliant, subway on the corner on 14th and 8th [i so lov saying that it makes me sound as if i know what im talking about!], Greenwich village round the corner, nice walk to [20mins] to Times square etcBreakfast was lovely, very relaxed from 8-11 i think, breads [different one each day], muffins, donuts ect and smoked salmon for the bagels at the wend. the bfast bar was nice during the day as well, as there was coffee and biscuits throughout the day and plates and glasses if you wanted to eat take out [the deli was amazing and we couldnt miss the opportunity at least one night]overall really nice, what made in special the customer service and Charlie the Cat!"
140,1768,"Nov 16 2007 	Excellent value for such a popular location	For $275 a night this property was a good deal. We had a Superior Deluxe on the second floor. The railroad car shaped room had adequate space for the two of us and our luggage. But as their website clearly states, this is a converted 5 story brownstone with no elevator and the stairs are quite narrow and steep. If one of the attendants carries your luggage to and from your room, be sure to tip him well. He will have earned it. The bath was clean, but tiny..no sharing. The shower was a separate glass brick enclosure around the corner in the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and our room facing the back was very quiet. The central air worked perfectly but it was nice to be able to open the window for fresh air. The &quot;sitting area&quot; was spartan with a small round table that barely held a laptop and the lamp. The 2 metal chairs could have used cushions, but at least the the free wireless was very fast. Each morning one of us would fetch a muffin and coffee from the kitchen downstairs and both were fresh and tasty. Everyone on the staff was courteous and helpful and it was great to have someone at the desk 24 hrs. If you are comfortable with B &amp; B's, you should like this place, and although it is not particularly &quot;botique&quot; or plush, it does have character. When 2 and 3 star hotel rooms that week (before the NY Marathon) were going for $500, it was a find. And having Balducci's and the Chelsea Market at opposite ends of the block added to the experience. With superb flights to and from Seattle on Jet Blue and excellent towncar service from/to JFK by Carmel, it was a wonderful 5 days. And we saw Xandu on Broadway twice. Go, you'll love it."
141,1768,"Nov 12 2007 	Home from Home	I loved this hotel.I arrived after an 8 hour journey from Atlanta. It's just a short walk from W14th Street station and was an welcome oasis. Also close to the Village.Richard on reception was very welcoming, knowing who I was as I came through the door exhausted. I was staying in the Tony Curtis room at the back of the hotel. It's a standard room with bathroom. It was small but I loved it - very homely.There is no lift so not ideal ias you have to carry your own bags.It's so often the people that make or break a stay and the staff here was so welcoming. I had a quick run in with the guy who looks like the uncle from The Sopranos when I lost my room key, but he was only looking after my own security.Continental breakfast was included and is taken in the small room at the back. It's small and I couldn't find a table to myself and not feeling sociable at that time of day, I had breakfast at Balduccis on the corner, Starbucks and the corner diner (on different mornings!)I can't recommend this place enough and I'd like to stay there again on my next visit."
142,1768,"Oct 30 2007 	Great location too...	The person we spoke to when booking was very helpful and informative, even offering travel advice for other parts of our extended visit to the east coast.The room was perfectly prepared and the housekeeping, for the 3 nights we stayed, first rate. The decoration was completely charateristic of the unusual style and decor chosen for the hotel.One expects a NYC hotel to have a higher price bracket to those elsewhere and given that, we felt the super delux room was good value for money. Breakfast provision was very satisfactory, although it could get quite cosy if too many guests ate at the same time. It was nice to have the use of proper plates and mugs.For us, the location a couple of minutes from the Subway and allowing full walking access to The Village was just right for the evening choice of restautant and drinking, or simply strolling.One small warning, if you struggle with stairs and carrying bags up them, this may be an issue, as there isn't a lift (elevator). We'd recomment the Chelsey and would stay again."
143,1768,"Oct 25 2007 	An excellent little hotel in a great part of town	We spent a great 4 nights in the Donna Reid room and absolutely loved the hotel and its location. The staff are very friendly and really make you feel at home. We had a standard room on the 4th floor, worth booking at least a standard so you don't have to share a toilet. The room was small, but large enough. The bed was very comfortable and the window, which overlooked the small courtyard garden had a blackout blind so we got some great sleep! Breakfast was a help yourself affair, the Sunday morning offering included smoked salmon and cream cheese. In the week we got a big selection of muffins, doughnuts and cookies, plus cereal, fruit and English muffins with jam. You could help yourself to a hot drink and cookie at any time of the day and you could buy bottled water from the fridge for $1 a bottle. A short walk from the hotel there is a huge selection of bars, restaurants and shops. This was my fourth trip to New York and this is the friendliest hotel I have stayed in, in by far the best location. Walking down Hudson street you could choose a different restaurant everynight for a fortnight and still not experience it all. There's also a great choice of bars. If you're gay you'll love the relaxed and friendly atmosphere, and if you're straight - ditto! Highly recommended and we'll definitely go back."
144,1768,"Oct 16 2007 	Liked this place ALOT	Stayed here with my husband for seven nights. We found the hotel to be very well located with subway on the street and easy walking to the village, soho, chelsea and meatpacking. Hotel itself was fine, the rooms were well appointed. we stayed in the Rock Hudson delux room and Anne Francis delux room both on fifth floor - quite a hike esp at the end of long days of walking manhattan but not a real problem after a couple of margeritas - very clean and it was really nice to come back to someone having switched on the AC as NYC was having a really hot beginning of fall when we went with temps in 80s. Found the staff to be friendly and helpful but unobtrusive and have already reco the hotel to a friend who is planning a trip to new york in the not too distant future. Thanks Chelsea Pines Inn for a great stay, I am pretty sure we will be back."
145,1768,"Sep 16 2007 	Excellent base for visiting NYC	We really enjoyed Chelsea Pines Inn and would happily recommend it to anyone as an excellent place to stay in New York. It's perfectly located for exploring - close to the subway and easy walking distance to Chelsea, the Village, just about anywhere. We were in on the top floor (NB: there's no elevator, only some fairly steep flights of stairs - a good cardio workout!) which overlooked the garden, so the room was very quiet and surprisingly spacious. The provision of a fridge was handy. The staff are really friendly too."
146,1768,"Sep 6 2007 	Fantastic find	Myself and my partner spent five nights at the Chelsea Pines. The experience was fantastic, on arrival we were made feel very welcome and given advice on what to do, see, shows to take in etc. We were staying on the top floor but if you're relatively young and fit you wont have any problems and the room (Deluxe) was fantastic. It was much bigger than we had expected with a seperate seating area in between the wash room and sleeping area. The breakfast was highly commendable and the stairs made a welcome way to burn off all those carbs and calories, a good choice of cereals, bread, porridge, donuts, muffins, smoked salmon along with coffee, tea and juice, as much as you can eat. Theres also a nice terrace to the rear of the building which is nice to sit out on and enjoy breakfast or just chill out,The area cannot be rated highly enough, its as listed right on the edge of the meatpacking district, chelsea and greenwich village. Theres lots of restaurants which open late in the area and plenty of bars. The subway is almost on the doorstep. We broke our trip to NY with a stop off in Mass, we stayed elsewhere on the second occasion, but regreted not coming back to the Chelsea Pines, not because our second location was poor quality, it just didnt compare. We'll be back at the Chelsea Pines on our next trip to NY next summer."
147,1768,"Sep 5 2007 	wonderful welcome	My husband and I were delighted with the warm welcome we received. The staff and owner went out of their way to be helpful. The location is perfect, the rooms while tiny provide everything you could ask for, and the friendly hotel cat, charming garden and good free breakfasts make this small hotel a real find."
148,1768,"Aug 18 2007 	Made welcome at a perfect location	Great location - really near the meatpacking district. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Rooms felt really unique, total opposite of most generic hotels. Loved the daily newsletter they put under your door with hints of things to do for the day.We were on the third floor and it really isn't a drag at all walking up the stairs so don't let that put you off!Would definitely stay there again next time I'm in NY."
149,1768,Jul 12 2007 	A resident cat with a goatee	I stayed at Chelsea Pines Inn in late April 2007. The staff were helpful and friendly and the resident cat Charlie was a regular drinking buddy. Both the private showers and shared toilets are kept very clean and tidy. Great value for money in a fantastic location.
150,1768,"Jun 24 2007 	Outstanding	My children and I stayed at the Chelsea Pines Inn recently. We found the staff and owners outstanding. Service with a smile. The rooms were fantastic and newly painted, and very comfortable, with a movie motif in each room and hallway. The breakfast was continental and very good. Parking is three doors down and the subway was easy and at near corners. Questions were answered with ease and again a smile. Very secure area also. Even groceries and bakeries nearby, along with many, many shops and eateries. Looking forward to our next visit."
151,1768,Jun 14 2007 	Super clean and affordable	The hotel was very clean and to rooms were very unique. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They have a great continental breakfast and an outside courtyard to enjoy it. Extremely close to the subway so you can travel all over the city. Excellent italian food at Primitivo a few blocks away.
152,1768,"Jun 9 2007 	Clean comfortable pleasant	This hotel was great.My friend and I wanted a place that was clean, tidy and 'worked' so we could to sleep, wash and get changed. This place fitted the bill perfectly.Because it is a relatively small hotel there is greater attention to detail than in the bigger super hotels, therefore if you have a problem or query you are dealt with sincerely.The staff were friendly, the rooms clean, stairwells tidy and it had a nice atmosphere. The themed rooms (female Hollywood gay icons?) were a great touch, and not imposing. They really gave the place some charachter.I think it had just been refurbished (apr/May '07) and therefore looked nice and tidy. Great transport links (14th Street Subway is 50m from the door), enable you to get anywhere quickly. The trendy areas (Chelsea, East Village, Soho, Grenwich) are all within 10 or 15 mins walk."
153,1768,"May 28 2007 	Perfect location and hosts.	We loved it here.... so easy to find from Port Authority, it was scary. Three or four subway stops away, and the front door is only about a thirty second walk from the subway's exit. Great location between Chelsea and the meatpacking district - the hotel is just a few blocks from Tenjune, a celebrity hangout!The Ann-Margaret room was nicely appointed with both a double bed and a twin bed. Extremely clean and decorated with movie posters. We actually didn't mind the walk up the stairs (this room is on the fourth floor) because we had to burn off the calories from all the Italian food we ate at Primatera (Primavera?), an excellent restaurant that our hosts recommended on the first night. The owner of the restaurant gave us two free shots of Limoncello while we were there.Moving on: a nicely sized bathroom, plus a separate shower room (very European in design). Lots of closet space for our belongings, and even a small fridge for our cold drinks. Nice to get a newsletter each morning summarizing the daily NYC happenings. What a beautiful view from our large window. We realized there is a nearby daycare/school nearby on our first morning, so (this is going to sound cheesy, but it's true) we found it nice to wake up to the sound of kids' laughter. Continental breakfast which includes fantastic donuts... again, we didn't mind climbing the stairs to get to our room! Also juice, coffee, fruit, muffins, etc. Cookies always on hand if you're hungry at 11pm.....mmmm. Nice inside area to eat in, as well as an outdoor patio.We'd definitely come back. You're not going to find nicer hosts or a better location while staying in the city. My only complaint is that Charlie the Cat didn't seem to like us very much.... he always ran away! Next time, I'll bring liver treats."
154,1768,"May 8 2007 	Just love the Chelsea area	Trying to find a place to stay, at the last minute, in NY can be tough especially for a reasonable price. Which brings me to the CPI. Great location, friendly, and going through some updating to make the place even better. The room we had was on the smaller side (Kim Novak Room) but who stays in their room. Rooms are decorated w/ movie posters. Everything you need,shower, clean, close to the subway &amp; includes a nice continental breakfast. This is a gay establishment but my wife and I felt right at home with the help of Charlie the cat!!!! No elevator and we made it up to our room with no problem even at our age (mid 50's). Emails to the property were answered quickly &amp; professionally. I repeat, Great Location, Good Price, Clean and a friendly staff. Thanks CPI !!!!"
155,1768,"May 3 2007	Loved Chelsea Pines!	The Chelsea Pines was pretty close to being PERFECT! The location was unbeatable! Right around the corner is Greenwich Village for great shopping, and the trendy Meat Packing District is literally a block away, where there are some great restaurants and fancy stores. The subway is right at your doorstep. My sister and I stayed over the Easter weekend in the Anne Margaret room, both of our beds were really comfy and the room came with a fridge. That was handy since there is a really great higher-end grocery store called Balducci's right around the corner, where we stocked up on snacks and even bought some great dinner stuff that we were able to heat up in the kitchen. The kitchen was always clean and is newly renovated. There was always coffee (you could take it to go too which was perfect) and cookies available. The breakfast was everything you could ask for. Fresh bagels, yogurt, fruit, pastry's and even some salmon and eggs one morning. The staff was very knowledgeable and really friendly. They let us check in early and they held our bags on our last day. The Chelsea Pines is definitely not your &quot;typical&quot; hotel which is why we chose it. It is young, fun and very welcoming. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!!"
156,1768,"Apr 11 2007	Fabulous Inn!	We loved our stay here. The rooms were clean and roomie considering it's the city. Breakfast was great every morning and included fresh baked breads. The staff was very polite and let us check in a little early. They also gave us suggestions on which trains to take where. Every morning we got a newsletter telling us of things to do in the city, like new museum openings or shows at near by theaters. There were maps of the city and fliers for different things to do in the hotel as well.The location was great too and for the price, you just can't beat it. I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends!"
157,1768,"Apr 4 2007 	Great fun in a fun part of Manhattan.	My partner and I discovered the CP Inn in a guide book. And not wanting to spend years trawling the net for a better deal we called them direct and made the reservation.Let me say it clearly and without ambiguity: This place is great and for all the right reasons.Yes, each room is themed and has name of an Academy Award winning actor.... but lets talk for real: This place is central, its clean and although it was being renovated during our stay, it was very comfortable. The other great advantage to this hotel is that if you're a gay/lesbian traveller who likes to meet other people when you travel there are lots of opportunities to do just that. The typical traveller to CP Inn is not a snooty type (they're on a budget too, remember?) and that means that your stay in New York can be extra fun. Location is fine- remember, you'll be in Manhattan and nothing is really that far away. Loads of shops, restaurants and what ever else you're inclined to do around the corner."
158,1768,"Mar 2 2007	Great Location	Stayed for a week at the Chelsea Pines Inn. It was a great location, close to the subway and also to a grocery store which came in handy for water, snacks etc. Room was small, very clean. Great breakfast. We stayed on the fifth floor and there is no elevator so we did get our exercise every day. Take that into consideration when you book. We are in pretty good shape and did alot of huffing and puffing as we climbed the stairs, especially with luggage. That is the only reason why I rated it average. I'd stay there again for sure"
159,1768,"Dec 17 2006 	Fabulous digs for little dough	We recently stayed at the Chelsea Pines for about a week, and loved it. The location is fabulous, at the intersection of Chelsea, the Village, and the Meatpacking DIstrict there is no lack of things to do, and the subway is a half block away for wider excursions. The hotel itself is a great home-away-from-home: friendly, pleasant, clean, and stylish (if your sense of style runs to the funky and kitsch, which ours definitely does). Rooms are on the small side, as you'd expect in Manhattan, but are laid out to take advantage of every inch and are very comfortable to be in. The included breakfast is a bonus. The staff is a gem. We will definitely stay here again."
160,1768,"Dec 15 2006 	Ok for straight folks too	At a quite last minute decision, I scrambled to book a B&amp;B in NYC. The Chelsea Pines was available, and I had glanced at the website very quickly. They didn't charge me any different for only a one-night stay, and the customer service on the phone was extremely informative and friendly. After I booked I examined the website further to see that the Chelsea caters more often to the gay community, and I had no problem with this but wondered if we'd feel like the outcasts at all. This was NOT the case at all. Getting there was extremely easy-from Penn Station only one stop using the &quot;A&quot; train downtown. The inn is directly visible upon exiting the subway station. It is secured, and service is right inside the door. We were given key-cards and told that coffee is always available. Our room was 3 flights up, and had just been cleaned. It was small, but nicely decorated with Ann-Margaret movie posters. The bathroom was very clean with wonderful thick towels and had a separate shower stall. It came with a fridge &amp; full cable tv. For a short stay I would highly recommend it. If I stayed for a week's worth, the only thing I might not have liked was the hike up stairs, but it is the city, so it worked. We did not take advantage of breakfast, but I did grab a coffee in the evening, and although it was about 5pm, it was good, and fresh.Check out time was at 12, they kindly offered to hold our luggage for us if we needed them to. The service at checkout could have been a little friendlier, but they seemed a little busy with some business people so maybe were distracted."
161,1768,"Nov 27 2006 	Great location and staff but quality issues	Manhattan is always a tricky proposition when it comes to lodging. Reasonable price and comfort rarely occupy the same space. For Chelsea Pines, I chose a reasonable price over other considerations.This property is ideally located on West 14th with easy access to the West Village, Chelsea and the Meatpacking District. The staff here is a gem. However, if you are accustomed to a certain level of comfort, this is not the place for you. For the budget traveler, well, you're a budget traveler.Even though I booked about six weeks ahead for the week of Thanksgiving, I was unable to reserve a deluxe room. I booked a standard instead, which was a big mistake. The bed in our room was one of the most uncomfortable I've ever encountered, and the shower was tiny. Yes, even by European standards. Luckily, due to a faulty light in our toilet area (located in its own closet), we were moved to a deluxe room for a couple of days of our stay. The deluxe room was like staying in a different hotel with a bed that was actually comfortable, extra space for sitting, and a decent sized bathroom. Bottom line, despite the location and a very helpful and friendly staff, I would only consider staying here again if a deluxe room were available."
162,1768,"Nov 6 2006 	Great Little Place in Heart of Manhattan	If you are a GLBT traveler looking for a fun place to stay in NYC this is it! Friendly staff, superclean rooms, and reasonable prices combine to make this a great deal. Located on West 14th St. and Eighth Ave., Chelsea Pines is within walking distance of most of the clubs and restaurants in Chelsea and the Village. It's also a short subway ride away from the theatre district and midtown. We stayed a week and felt as if we had our own home in the big city. Simple but adequate continental breakfast gets your day off to a good start."
163,1768,"Oct 31 2006 	Friendly clean helpful staff - a great hotel!	We stayed here twice during our visit to the US in September. Both rooms were clean, quiet, with great facilities, and large comfortable beds! The staff were really friendly and helpful. The breakfast was lovely and fresh, with the hotel's home-made breads a real treat! With coffee and cookies around all day the breakfast room/conservatory was a pleasant, homely place to spend some time between sight-seeing trips! The only downside was the narrowness of the breakfast area when it got busy in the morning - but on the whole other guests were pleasant, polite and worked around each other..... it's not the Hotel's fault that the odd 1 or 2 fellow guests were pretty obnoxious and thought they owned the place - but fortunately they only stayed 2 days! Can happen anywhere!I would definately go back, and recommend it to friends with no hesitation. The movie posters gave the place a great quirkieness which really let you know you were somewhere interesting and memorable - not a bland, corporate &quot;could be anywhere&quot; hotel chain.The location was superb being situated in between really interesting and lively areas, and right on the Subway lines."
164,1768,"Oct 30 2006 	Are You Inn to Chelsea??	Awesome.Each floor is painted a different colour, all the rooms are based on a gay &quot;Icon&quot; and the hall walls are covered in old movie posters.We stayed in the Rock Hudson room on the 5th floor (4th for non-americans). It was a differen colour from the hallway and the wall were covered in posters - see our pic's.Coffee is available all day and a very nice continental breakfast available in the morning.The staff we really great and helpful with booking show's, basketball tickets etc. Also some great suggestions for food n the area.Only downer is the stairs - after a days sight seeing - they are quite daunting."
165,1768,"Jul 20 2006 	The Judy Garland room? It doesn't get much gayer than this.	Plastered with memorabilia of screen Divas (and Divos) from yesteryear, the CPI is a great little place to stay that won't break the bank. (Most of) the staff is super-friendly, the rooms are clean, and unlike a lot of shared-bathroom places, the rooms themselves have showers and sinks. Fantastic location too!"
166,1768,"Jun 22 2006	Fabulous and Welcoming!!	The FABULOUS staff gave us one of the warmest welcomes I've ever received and made us feel incredibly at home. The location was perfect and the building clean and cool - and the fresh, daily speciality breakfast breads - FABULOUS! Highly recommended to anyone with an open, gay-friendly mind!!!!"
167,1768,"Jun 7 2006 	Very comfortable and convenient	I stayed for one night in a deluxe room. My room was long and narrow. the width of the room was the length of the bed, which I had to climb over to reach the window. Most of the hotel is painted in dark colors and decorated with movie posters, which gives character, but probably makes the rooms feel smaller. The &quot;couch&quot; is a single bed, so the room can fit 3 people. Everything seemed clean and comfortable. Nice to have a refrigerator in the room. Breakfast included very fresh bagels and muffins, fruit, etc. Service was friendly. Subway at the end of the block."
168,1768,"Jun 5 2006	What a Gem!	Just returned from a four night stay at the Chelsea Pines Inn and we had a brilliant time! Staff bent over backwards to help us out (even lent us a laptop to get some theatre tickets online). They gave us two restaurant recommendations for 24 and for Primitivo which has to be the best Italian meal I've had in a long time and very resonably priced. Fantastic location, really central and only a 10 min walk from Christopher Street. We stayed in the Paul Newman room with own bathroom and it was more than big enough and spotless. Ok, so it's not the Hilton, but then you are not paying Hilton prices either and to be honest I'd rather stay here for the atmosphere/staff/location. Fantastic - we will stay here again when we come to New York. Big thank you to the member of staff who seemed to be always on duty in a supervisory roll and commands a very tight ship - Charlie the cat."
169,1768,"Jun 4 2006	Great Value	With my first trip to New York I wanted to stay away from the usual tourist centre of times square and closer to the night and restraunt areas of New York.The Chelsea Pines Inn was great between 2 Subway Stations on 14th street. Only 2 stops from the central subway station and also walking distance ot times square. But it had the greatest neighbourhood with the best buzz. Room was basic but had a fridge, Toliet was shared with the floor. The staff was amazing and always helpful. Breakfast was provided everymoring in their patio area to start the day giving a bigger cost saving. This place was great if you are on a budget and need a clean and comfortable place to stay."
170,1768,"May 24 2006 	Cool place great value	Last month I took my first ever trip to New York City. As someone from a small town, I admit I was a bit nervous about visiting New York alone, but I had set up several interviews and was looking for a good hotel value for five nights. Some friends back home recommended Chelsea Pines, so I thought I'd give them a try. Very glad that I did!Location was terrific; right in the middle of gay New York, art gallery New York, great restaurant New York...well, you get the idea. Price was lower than anything else I checked on the web, and rooms were a good size for New York, I thought, considering the stories I had heard (rooms at twice the price the size of walk-in closets), and the movie themes for all the rooms was way cool (I stayed in the Jeff Richards room; never heard of him, but very hunky, and I asked to see several other rooms, which were equally cool). My room did not have its own toilet, but the shower and sink area were really nice; room was well layed out, and even though it faced the front of the building (a pretty busy 14th Street), the windows are double-glazed, and they thoughtfully provide a &quot;white noise&quot; machine which drowns out any street noise.Staff was extremely helpful and friendly; when I told them it was my first time in NY, they gave me all kinds of info and maps and advice (and a good restaurant discount card for a cool local diner). Breakfast room (which leads out to a pretty greenhouse and an even prettier garden) was chockful of goodies, tasty homemade breads every day, real NY bagels, fresh coffee (which was also available 24/7, snacks and cookies too). Rooms were cleaned daily, chocolates always on my pillow, and even the hall WC was kept clean.Still waiting to hear about a job offer, but if I come back to NY to look for an apartment, I'll definitely be staying with the great guys at the cool Chelsea Pines!"

172,1768,"Apr 19 2006	Grimy Flea Bag	A crime that anyone can charge money to stay in this place! I've traveled all over the world, and this is the filthiest place I've ever stayed in. Radiators coated with 1/4 inch of dust, dirty sheets, someone else's clothes in the room when I checked in -- you get the picture. Looks like they haven't employed a handyman in three decades. Staff at reception desk smoked and were generally unhelpful. Do yourself a favor and avoid this flea bag."
173,1768,"Apr 9 2006	Best choice for gay visitors!	We stayed at the Chelsea Pines for a week at the end of March. The staff cannot be faulted in their friendly and helpful service. The room was clean, breakfast great and constant coffee in the kitchen very welcome. Being in the heart of the gay district meant that you have bars and clubs on the doorstep, but the main tourist attractions (Empire State Building, Macys etc) were only a 15 minute walk away. The subway is 20 seconds away on the corner of 8th Ave. Can't recommend this place enough. The kitchen was a great place to meet fellow guests and swap stories about where to go and what to do. I won't come back to New York unless I can stay at the Chelsea Pines!"
174,1768,"Apr 4 2006	I'll be back!	Stayed for two weeks in March in a quiet ground floor room with bathroom and couldn't have been happier. A fridge, a couple of cable TV channels, a reliable shower and pictures of hunky George Nader on every wall..what more could one ask? A huge breakfast in the dining room, 24 hour coffee and tea, perfect position at the 14th St. subway and extra-friendly staff were all greatly appreciated. The room was over-heated and we had to ask that it be vacuumed when we arrived, but otherwise I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. Many thanks to Jay and Al!"
175,1768,"Mar 6 2006	Great location	Stayed in the Doris Day room, which has a private bath and is only a two-flight walk up (as other posters have noted, there is no elevator). Yes, the rooms and hallways have movie posters, but rooms (and hallways) are exceedingly drab. The bottom drawer on the dresser didn't work, the ironing board is one of those tiny things that never quite works right, three bulbs in the bathroom remained burned out during the length of our stay . . . The &quot;breakfast area&quot; off the lobby is teeny-tiny, and we finally left rather than try to work our way past the other lodgers there. We did notice a slight odor in the lobby one day from the cute little cat.That said, this hotel has to have one of the best locations in all of New York for the gay or lesbian visitor -- walk a few blocks this way to Chelsea and a few blocks that way to the West Village, plus the subway is right on the corner. And I can stay in a drab room when the price and location are right. The rooms did seem clean, and the management makes the attempt to &quot;go the extra mile:&quot; they slip a small flier of the next day's cultural events under your door each night. As with any hotel, the helpfulness of the staff is hit or miss -- some hardly seemed to care, while others bent over backward to be helpful.So if you don't go expecting too much, and don't expect to spend much time in your room (we didn't), this is an excellent choice for the budget-conscious traveler."
176,1768,"Mar 2 2006	Great Stay	Had a gerat stay here, the staff is so helpful and attentive. My room was so cute, with great old movie posters. Breakfast was great and a good money saver.The place is clean and the location can't be beat, with the subway on the corner. Best of all they were able to get me tickts to the theate at 40% off."
177,1768,"Feb 17 2006	I (heart) New York and this place is OK too	I stayed here at the start of September 2005. My room was fine, though a little dark (I ended up with a body crisis for my first two days because of the bad lighting - couldn't see me in the mirror properly). The window didn't seem to shut properly and the air con unit was very loud. However, if any of these things concerned me enough at the time, I would have mentioned it to the staff then - they didn't and so I didn't. Breakfast was good and a great way to meet your fellow guests (i.e. pick-up), but don't get me wrong, this is not one of those places where you check-in, get it out and then get it on. On the whole, I must say, this place felt a little musty to me, it needs a good cleaning and dusting (maybe that's just the house wife in me coming out). I also thought the shared WCs could have been a little cleaner, I'll admit that I am quite fussy about that kind of stuff but I don't think it was at the standard that most people would expect (anyway, who goes to New York to sit in a WC?). The staff were friendly and helpful and the location is great. If I stayed here again, I would get an en-suite room."
178,1768,"Feb 7 2006	I will be staying at The Chelsea Pines Hotel again.....	I loved my stay at The Chelsea Pines Hotel. It is certainly located so that I could walk to most places that I wanted to go. The hotel was clean and the hotel staff was friendly and helpful.I do have 2 suggestions. It would have made my stay somewhat better if the shower head had been better. When taking a shower, it is nice to have a full stream of water. I must say that I could ---- harder than the water coming out of my shower head. I would suggest one of the Rainmaker showerheads. It feels just like a shower.The other suggestion is my cable wire connecting my TV needs to be permanently connected. One day I was without cable because the wire had come loose in the back. I did not realize this because I thought the cable had gone off. Only the next day when I realized that the cable wire had become disengaged, I reattached the wire. Also, could you please get a couple more channels on the cable (maybe CNN, TCM and AMC)?Thanks so much and I am looking forward to my next stay.Christopher Freeman"
179,1768,Nov 8 2005	Bring Your Own Ajax	The Chelsea Pines is just plain dirty. I found myself actually cleaning the walls as they were too disgusting to deal with. Never again.
180,1768,Sep 19 2005	Disgraceful!!	Traveled from Canada....what a dump!! Anyone who comments that this is a great place to stay needs serious help! Very tiny room and dirty carpets. Run for the hills!!
181,1768,"Aug 17 2005	Great Value Charming Friendly	I'm a native New Yorker who moved away last year. This was actually the first time I've stayed in a hotel in NYC and I wanted to spend my money on clothes and entertainment rather than a 5-star hotel. I was very surprised at how cheap the Chelsea Pines was, comparatively speaking ($160/night for large deluxe room), when 5-stars charge over $400/night. It's very conveniently located at 14th St. between 8th and 9th Aves., only a five minute walk from the center of gay life in NY. I like staying in gay and gay-friendly hotels, and the Chelsea Pines was one of the better ones I've experienced in the last few years. Very friendly, accessible staff, fun and kitschy rooms (I stayed in the &quot;Paul Newman&quot; room, replete with original posters of his movies) and a decent though not super breakfast. Also, I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it was--I've stayed in a few places where drunken screaming queens raging in the hallways make life miserable, and this was definitely not in that category. I saw that someone gave this hotel a very negative rating and I'm puzzled because I'm quite demanding and this hotel exceeded my expectations."

183,1768,Jul 7 2005	Really awful weekend. Avoid this place.	What a dump! I will never stay there again. I will sleep on a park bench in hell before I stay at this horribly appointed and smoke-filled pit.My (non-smoking) room smelled like a bar. It was smokey and beer riddled. The staff was unprofessional and inept. The only good thing I have to say about this place was there was a really sweet cat that hung out in the lobby.
184,1768,Apr 5 2005	Chelsea Pines great for Gay/gay friendly travellers	A friendly well-located (for the Village and Chelsea) clean hotel. Staff were helpful and rooms were comfortable and &quot;uniquely decorated!&quot; The only thing to watch is there is no lift and the stairs are steep due to the age of this quaint building.

1,1778,"Excellent clean and what a location!	What a pleasant find! The room and bathroom were c-l-e-a-n. The mattress was new and very comfortable. The included breakfast was good, convenient and unlimited. The front desk staff was great! There was discounted parking in the garage directly across the street. All of this a block away from Times Square! You just can't beat it."
2,1778,"Excellent Hotel!	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for the parade last week. The location is great, the staff was very friendly, and the rooms were clean. Yes, the rooms are small, but who wants to stay in the room all the time when you're in New York City?! I would highly recommend this hotel. Free internet access, free breakfast, you can't find a better bargain in midtown. I booked the hotel on the phone and received a lower rate than the online rate, then received another 10% off when we checked in! Stay here! (and be sure to have a bagel at breakfast...they are the best!)"
3,1778,"GREAT!	This hotel was so much better than I expected! Clean, quiet (that's rare for NY, especially Times Sq), friendly staff, comfortable bed. We will definitely be back to this cute little hotel.Thank you for a great weekend in NY, Comfort Inn!"
4,1778,"Great location and price	Situated half a block from Times Square this place is a gem. Well priced for the area and upon arrival we were informed that there would be another 10% reduction. Rooms are a good size and the king size beds are so comfortable. Breakfast is included which consisted of toast, bagels, muffins, danishes, cereals, yoghurt fruit and drinks. Always in plentiful supply with a staff member ensuring everything was clean. Only issue with this hotel is that their is no concierge however staff were very helpful."
5,1778,"Nov 15 2009 	Why stay anywhere else? Excellent!	Stayed here in October with my 15 year old daughter. It is a few steps from Times Square. A perfect location. I was worried about our safety in a big city like NYC (a woman and a young girl) but never felt uneasy at all walking the short distance from Times Square to the hotel even at 11pm. Checking in with Stanlee was very quick and he was extremely friendly (even though it was 1a.m.). Our room was a little on the small size and the view from the window was of a brick wall. I called Stanlee straight away and asked if there was another room, but it was Saturday night and they were fully booked. He did make a note that we should be re-roomed the next morning for the remaining 3 nights of our trip. Next morning, true to their word we were swiftly re-roomed by Rodriguez. Excellent service and the new room was front facing and almost twice the size of the first room. Brilliant!!The breakfast room was always busy, with people often sharing a table, but where else in New York do you get a free breakfast? We only shared a table one morning out of the 4 that we were there and on our last morning we got our breakfast bagels, donut/pastries and a coffee and took it to our room to have.The room was very clean and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. If I go to New York again this hotel will be my first choice, without a doubt!!Over the road from the hotel is John's Shaghai. We got a take-away to eat in our room from there one evening. The food was excellent. Next door to John's Shanghai there is a grocery shop and we got our drinks from there.The hotel is perfectly located for you to choose whether you are going to eat out or on the hoof.I had to check in online for my return flights and this was no problem with the free internet access at the hotel. check in complete in 10 minutes. This saved us a lot of trouble at the airport as our flight was overbooked and if I hadn't done this, we may have been put on the next flight instead!!!!My tip to all air travellers is to CHECK IN ONLINE!!! We flew with Virgin Atlantic, but I know that it is common practice for lots of airlines to overbook flights and even though I had booked our seats, if you don't check in online your seats can be booked by someone else!!! I learnt this lesson on the way out to NYC and this made checking in 1hour longer than it would otherwise have been if we had checked in online."
6,1778,"Nov 13 2009 	Decent option for cheaper stay in Manhattan	Although the rates are steals given this hotel's unbeatable location (literally a one minute walk to Times Sq and the Rockefeller center), this shouldn't mask the fact that this is not a great place. The lobby and breakfast room smelled terrible throughout the stay and the breakfast spread is frankly a joke. The fitness center on the gound floor is far too cramped, though given the size of the hotel itself (tiny) it 's not too bad. Where this place really goes wrong is the rooms. As far as I'm aware most of the rooms are extremely small, which would be fine if the hotel hadn't tried to cram all the furnishings for a room twice these sizes into them. Huge body-length mirrors are hung in unfortunate places, cabinets can't be opened due to proximity to beds... you're basically forced to walk sideways to get from the bed to the bathroom. That said, the rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and given the fact that most rooms face away from the busy 46th St, they're also quiet. Decent place, good value, but for even better value stay at the nearby sister property, the Hotel at Times Square."
7,1778,"Nov 9 2009 	Affordable friendly and clean	Located nearTimes Square, this reasonably priced (for NYC) hotel was clean, the staff friendly and responsive. I could move around both sides of the bed and there was a desk in the room too -- for NYC, that's roomy. Free safe in the room, nice-sized flat screen tv, iron, ironingg board, small coffee pot and continental breakfast. Don't despair if you don't want to carry your laptop: they have a business center with 2 PCs and printer (no charge for printing). There's also a small, pleasant fitness center.Best was the staff. Smiles all around the hotel. Front desk so welcoming! I told them the door to my room squeaked; 2 hours later, no squeak. Hairdryer didn't work, returned back to a new one. My sixth floor room was surprisingly quiet and it was put to a big test, as my first night the Yankees won the World Series and there were loud celebrants on Broadway which is 1/2 block from the hotel. Every once in a while I'd hear a whoop or a horn but nothing loud enough to be annoying.I searched and searched TripAdvisor for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location and couldn't find anything that was NY City affordable until I found this Comfort Inn -- and when I return to NY, I'm staying here."
8,1778,Nov 7 2009 	An excellent value in a great location	The staff at this hotel is very accommodating and helpful. The hotel is in a great location. The room we stayed in was small but nice. It was on the second floor and close to the street so it was pretty noisy. If you are a light sleeper you should request a room in the rear of the hotel away from the street. This property offers free wireless internet and has a business center that is also available at no charge. If you are going to the city to see a show in the theater district this is an excellent place to stay.
9,1778,"Nov 3 2009 	Value Convenience and Nice Stay	Selected this hotel based on good reviews, price just under $200 and closeness to the theater district. In addition, Times Square is a fun area, close to restaurants and shopping and convenient to the subway. Although restaurant row is 8th Ave., my son and I found that 9th Ave. has tons of less expensive and just as good dining. The cab trip to the hotel from Laguardia Airport was $27 plus $4 toll plus tip. The hotel itself was very comfortable and the staff very helpful. I was able to use the computer and printer in the business room most times when I wanted or had a short wait. Although it is a large hotel, the elevator was not slow or full. Check in and out was quick. The breakfast room staff was very good and kept the orange juice and coffee etc. flowing. A big plus is that the coffee in the breakfast room is available fresh all day! No need to use the in-room pot. The room also has it's own ironing board and iron and a hair dryer that works. The plus of the rooms is that they provide four comfy pillows per bed and the mattresses are good-not extra firm or too soft. We asked for a two bed room, which I later learned are all in a row on each floor and do not have a view of the street. The window is high anyway so it wasn't important and the location was very quiet. We were on the 6th floor and heard no traffic or neighbors.The only negatives we found was that the door to the bathroom was mostly glass and you could see through it! Amazing, huh?! We had brought a garment bag for wedding clothes and there was a hook over the door on the bathroom side that we could hang it and cover the glass. Otherwise no privacy in the bathroom-beware! Also, like most places, they could use an upgrade in toilet paper and tissue. I did like the design with the sink and mirror in the bathroom and not in the sleeping area.I would definately stay here again to be able to walk to the theater and dinner. The savings over comparable hotels is probably $50 a day. Great find!"
10,1778,"Nov 1 2009 	Great Value	This is a modest hotel, but if you'd rather spend your money on sightseeing, good food, entertainment and shopping than a room, then stay at the Comfort Inn. I was a bit nervous that it would be a bit dodgey given its low cost in comparison to other New York hotels, but I was wrong. The hotel is spotlessly clean, our room (and bed) was very comfortable, the staff were helpful and most pleasant, the free breakfast was basic but there was plenty of it and the location for first time New York tourists couldn't be better. It was terrific to be so close to Time Square, to the hop on/hop off buses, Broadway shows, the subway and the fabulous restaurants in Restaurant Row among other things. There were two computers for guest use which was also very helpful.This is not a glamorous hotel, but if you're being 'careful' about your spending money, then you couldn't go past the Comfort Inn Midtown. We stayed in a more expensive hotel on the 2nd half of our trip, but to be honest, if we're ever able to return to New York again, I'd certainly be happy to stay here."
11,1778,"Nov 1 2009 	Best value	We had been to Manhattan before, and we recommend this hotel for the value and location. The rooms are the same size as the high-priced Times Square places (all of which are small), plus you save money by eating your breakfast right at the hotel before starting your day. You are two blocks off Times Square, and about 5 blocks from major theaters, and three blocks from the 1 Train (subway) to downtown (to catch Ellis Island Ferry). It's a no-brainer to recommend this one to friends. You easily save $100 a night by staying here, plus the breakfast money saved. No bellman or concierge, but who really needs them anyway?"
12,1778,"Oct 27 2009 	Comfortable room great location	We read many positive reviews of this hotel, but it was even better than expected. Check-in was quick and efficient. We had room #906 with a king size bed. Though small, it was comfortable and very nicely decorated. There was a small desk with a chair, bedside tables, and a larger unit that included the television. The best thing was the bed - one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in; I wanted to take it home with me. A minor irritation was that the flat screen TV was mounted to the side of the bed, not the best position for viewing. The bathroom was clean and had everything we needed. The location of the hotel is excellent- one block from Times Square and about 3 blocks to the subway. Yet 46th Street itself is quiet and noise was not an issue at all. There are several restaurants within one block, along with two deli's. We enjoyed St Andrew's Pub and Restaurant, right across the street. The continental breakfast at the hotel has the usual items, toast and bagels, a couple of cereals, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs. Everything was fresh and the breakfast attendant kept everything clean and stocked. The only drawback is that the breakfast room could use more tables - I suspect there is simply no room to expand. Overall, we were very happy with this hotel and wouldn't hesitate to return."
13,1778,"Oct 20 2009 	2nd stay did not disappoint	Comfort Inn Midtown is a gem! Comfortable beds, with everything you need in the room. But lets face it, who wants to stay in your room when you are in NY. Right off times square this is the perfect location to get anywhere. The area is safe and the staff helpful. A particular mention to the guy that checked me in. Originally from India, he had fun having a go at me about our not so successful aussie cricket team. It was nice to discuss something so familiar. A car was organised by front desk to take me to the airport. $55 tips, tolls everything. Free internet and fitness centre and continental breakfast make it the best place to stay."
14,1778,"Oct 20 2009 	Great hotel fantastic location very well appointed highly recommended	This was the highlight of our trip. We expected an old room in an old hotel, but found a very modern room, great service and a perfect location.We were within a 2 minute walk to Times Square, and another 2 to the Subway, restaurants galore and dozens of shops. It is very obvious that the hotel had a professional refurbishment not long ago, and it works. The hotel feels old world classy downstairs, and the rooms comfortable and contemporary.We can't recommend this hotel enough, pick this one, you won't be disappointed."
15,1778,"Oct 19 2009 	excellent hotel with great staff	This was my first visit to New York. The location of the hotel allowed us to visit the Opera House, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cloisters. The hotel is right off Broadway, 2 blocks from Time Square. Travelling by subway was easy thanks to the superb and friendly advice of the personnel at the hotel. They allowed us to store our luggage the day we checked out for several hours and also the following week when we returned from a second part of our trip, when we had a 6 hour stop over in NY. The rooms were very quiet, very clean, nicely decorated and the beds were oh SO comfortable. Thank you Comfort Inn for making my first visit such a wonderful memory!!"
16,1778,"Oct 15 2009 	Great location - would definitely go there again!	We stayed here for 8 nights and really ejoyed our stay. Clean room (room 906, bigger than we'd expected after reading about those small Manhattan hotel rooms), free breakfast and internet, very nice stuff and last but not least the absolutely perfect location at Times Square! If we get to go to NYC again, we would love to stay here again!"
17,1778,"Oct 11 2009 	Great stay for the money!!	My husband &amp; I spent 4 nights at this hotel while sightseeing with friends. Having been in NYC several times and paying twice the price at other hotels, this was a very pleasant surprise! Great Times Square location! While the rooms are not large, they are adequate and nicely appointed. Everything was very, very clean. The staff was quite friendly &amp; helpful. A basic breakfast was included (that's an additional savings). I was also pleased with the car service they booked for us. It was only $5 more than the cramped cab we rode in from JFK to the hotel. I'll definitely book this hotel for future visits."
18,1778,"Oct 10 2009 	By far the most bang for your buck in the area	We paid $135/night during the height of the tourist season for this newly renovated room a block off of Times Square. The rooms are small, but very comfortable. If possible, request an 01 or 02 room - they're on the corner and quite a bit larger. I highly recommend this hotel, and it will be my go-to hotel for all future NYC stays."
19,1778,"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent choice	I've stayed in NYC many times and have paid triple for hotels that did not even come close to the value and convenience of the Comfort Inn Midtown. Rooms were spotless, continental breakfast was included (bagels, toast, cereals, yogurt, fruit), the business centre didn't charge for internet access or printing of boarding passes, the location was fantastic especially for seeing theatre, and the staff were helpful and courteous. I asked for a room that didn't face the street so my window was basically facing a brick wall but it was the first time that I have heard absolutely no street noise in a NYC hotel! It was so quiet and great. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC."
20,1778,"Oct 8 2009 	Excellent small hotel in a central location.	I have traveled to NYC many times in the last couple decades and this may have been the best deal for a hotel I have seen. It's spotless, located in the center of everything, close to several subway stops and the rooms are sized nice.The staff was also VERY nice. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to someone looking for a great price and a nice room."
21,1778,"Oct 2 2009 	Great location 	This hotel was $140/night which is basically cheap by NYC standards unless you want to stay in a crackhouse like the Madison Hotel. It was a small room but had everything you needed, even a flat screen t.v. which is just for show since everyone knows when you're visiting NYC you're hardly going to be in your room! However, having said that, you want to stay somewhere that is comfortable after a long day of wandering the island. The staff were nice, there is a free internet room, and they kept my luggage for me no problem while I had already checked out but wanted to walk around a bit more before I moved on to my next destination. It is a great location, 2 min walk to Broadway Ave. and near Bryant Park. The only thing was the bathroom door wouldn't close fully but luckily I was with my boyfriend so that didn't matter too much!"
22,1778,Sep 29 2009 	Great Hotel for people on a budget!	My bf and I stayed her in mid-May 2009 and had a wonderful time. The hotel was in a perfect location (few blocks from Time Square and Rockefeller Center) and provided all the things that we needed. Our room had it's own safe which was very nice to have. The room was relatively quiet with it's location and the general noise from the city. It was nice not to have to walk far for a main subway station. We spent most of our time walking around and the hotel was easy to come back to once we were familiar with the area. We would stay here again the next time we're in NY. The staff was VERY nice and pleasant to deal with.
23,1778,"Sep 26 2009 	Great Staff Great Location	Stayed for 1 night as a Stopover at the end of our vacation to save some money. We were very impressed with the staff they were all so friendly and helpful. The room was small ( we had stayed in another NYC hotel the previous week which was larger but way more expensive) but it was immaculate, very clean, soft towels and comfy bed.The location was a winner for us, the Scottish Bar across the road was pretty nice and we went to The View Bar at the Top of The Marriot Hotel for the cocktails, buffet and to experience a revolving bar/restaurant. Times Square is at the end of the block but we found the hotel to be quiet. Would stay again if on a short break."
24,1778,"Sep 25 2009 	Good hotel for a Manhattan stay	We spent five days at this hotel for vacation. The room was small for the three of us, but that was expected; otherwise, it was clean and very quiet for NY City. Location is outstanding with theaters and subway stations all very close. Staff was friendly and helpful. Also provided is a free basic continental breakfast (in a small room) and exercise facility. The rate (for Manhattan) was very good and we would definitely consider this hotel for a NY stay again."
25,1778,"Sep 22 2009 	Hotel made of friends	Excellent hotel, nice people view, since the bellboys to the boy's breakfast. I recommend for sure."
26,1778,"Sep 19 2009 	A New York Jewel !	Our stay was for 2 days and the Comfort Inn was perfect! Location was great, the room was newly remodeled with attention to comfort and very clean. Price? For all that is offered it is a steal!"
27,1778,"Sep 16 2009	I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.	My daughter and I stayed three nights. We were in NY to enjoy the theatre. This hotel is in a perfect location for that (1/2 a block from Times Square). Our room was small (not unexpected), but we had all the space we needed. The room was well-appointed, spotlessly clean and quiet (2nd floor away from the street). The bathroom was also clean and functional. I liked the business center and the continental breakfast was convenient. Wouldn't hesitate to book again. Staff were helpful and knowledgeable."
28,1778,"Sep 15 2009 	Very Good hotel in excellent location .... will stay there again.	I stayed there for a 3 day weekend in mid Sept. It was my first time at this hotel and I was very pleased with my entire stay. The check-in went smoothly and the staff was professional. The rooms are somewhat on the small side ... but I had a king size bed and a big screen tv in the room. My room did not face the street and it was extremely quiet. It is very convenient to Times Square. I go to NY about once a year to see plays and usually stay at other comparably priced hotels in the area (Milford Plaza, Hotel Edison etc.). This was a much nicer hotel and only about a 5 minute walk to Times Square. I will definitely stay there again."
29,1778,"Sep 13 2009 	We will be back! This is a winner!	Indeed, this is a great location-a block from Times Square, close to good restaurants and the theater district. The rooms are small, but some more expensive hotels have much smaller rooms. Don't expect many frills or great views, but the staff was friendly and helpful, the beds were comfortable (pillowtop), and room was very clean. We weren't asked to write a review, but we decided this will be our hotel of choice for future trips. It is an unbeatable value for the location."
30,1778,"Sep 10 2009 	Very pleasant stay!	We stayed in this hotel during the 9/4 - 9/7 weekend. I would say all the hotel staff we encountered were very friendly. The hotel room is not fancy but very clean and comfortable. The location is great, close to Rockfeller Center and Times Square. All subway lines are accessible within two blocks. I would suggest bringing ear plugs when you visit New York in all cases, it really helps you to get a good sleep no matter you get front side or back side rooms. In Midtown New York there is no true &quot;quiet&quot; rooms, beleive me. Breakfast was good too. I really recommend this hotel. Unless you are looking for style, this a great choice."
31,1778,"Sep 8 2009 	Warning: Print out a copy of your reservation or get extra charges	I won't repeat what other reviewers have said -- this place does have a good location, great rooms, etc.But two things.1) When we checked in, they handed us a welcome package that included a note to &quot;Write a review on tripadvisor if we enjoy our stay&quot;. So some of the reviewers have been pointed by the hotel to come here. Just keep that in mind.2) Like another reviewer said below, we had a problem with a $15 extra surcharge. I had made my reservation, then updated it. When we checked in, the woman behind the desk could only see the original reservation. She then wanted to charge us the rack rate + $15 extra (not our discounted rate). Thankfully, I had a hard copy of our reservation right with me. When she saw it, she corrected it and we got our initial rate. It was corrected right away, but the incident struck me as really odd, despite us enjoying our stay. So my advice: PRINT OUT YOUR RESERVATION and DOUBLECHECK it if you stay here."
32,1778,"Sep 6 2009 	Nice Hotel - Nice Location - Would stay again	Just got back from Labor weekend trip to NYC. Always stayed on New Jersey side before as hotels are cheaper for price and amenities. However, this time wanted to stay in mid-town to be closer to the city excitement. The hotel is in nice location and convenient to subway - the orange line was right around the corner and the different subway lines options a few blocks to 42 and Time Square. The Top of the Rock was 3 minutes walking distance away - same with the top end of Times Square. I was very surprised about how easier it was to get to hotel from JFK airport. I just hopped the Air Train to Jamaica station and then took the LIRR which took about 25 minutes to reach Penn Station. It is about 20 minute walk from Penn Station to hotel or you can just take a taxi or take the subway to Times Square which is one stop north. As for the hotel itself, it is clean and seemed to be remodeled a few years back. The staff was nice and helpful - room was ready upon arrival around 11 am. The only issue is the noise from the street. There are some pubs across the street which get loud at night so I had to run the AC window unit to drown out the street noise. But over all I liked the hotel and would stay again next visit to NYC. And the hotel had free wi-fi in the rooms - so I could use my iPhone to check LIRR and Subway schedules."
33,1778,"Sep 4 2009 	Great Experience	From check in to check out, our experience was wonderful. Ivonne, at the front desk was so cheerful and welcoming. The gentlemen who assisted us and handled our luggage were great as well. the room was immaculate and breakfast was great. We also enjoyed the fact that we were able to store our luggage after we checked out. we will stay there next time for sure!"
34,1778,"Sep 3 2009 	Arrogant staff - Poor Customer Service	I reserved the room through Apple Core Hotels. While the location is good for theater events and the rooms are decent, customer service is terrible. My room was reserved in my name with my credit card - in my maiden name. My husband was able to check in, no questions asked. When I attempted to check in they refused to give me a key until his return, changed the rate, and proceeded to quote corporate policy - all for a $15 dollar increase. I walked out to wait for my husband and when we both re-entered a woman was talking to the employee. All she was interested in was getting us to initial the $15 increase. I sent an online complaint to their corporate site and the the GM answered my complaint in a manner that indicated where the employee gets his arrogance and ignorance. Guess what...it was the woman. This GM did not bother to introduce herself or ask us any questions that night. All she wanted just our initials. In addition, my husband asked this same employee for directions to the theater. An 'I don't know' would have sufficed. He sent us two avenues and four blocks out of our way. The theater was literally around the corner from the hotel. We lost 20 minutes and had to rush back to make it before the 8:00 PM start.Don't bother! There are plenty of great hotels at a low price in the area."
35,1778,"Sep 1 2009 	Great Location	My wife and I stayed at his hotel Aug 26-30. We found it clean, comfortable and quiet. As many others have posted, the hotel has a great location. We found all the staff to be helpful and friendley. Would stay there again without question."
36,1778,"Aug 22 2009 	Quaint hotel great stay!	If I could describe this hotel in one word, it would be quaint. I recently came back from a very pleasant 3 night stay. I actually booked this hotel months ago, cancelled when I found a better rate, then re-booked it when their rate became the best one. I got an excellent AAA rate booked through the hotel's website. I arrived early, and my room wasn't ready, he told me to check back at 12 and it would be ready, even though check in time wasn't until 3. He let me store my bags and use the business center as there was something I really needed to check. The breakfast room is open from 7:30-10:30, it was open when I arrived, but I didn't use it until the following morning. I didn't come back until later on in the afternoon, when I was checked in and given room 809, 1 queen bed as I was traveling by myself. The room was small, but quaint and charming. It was clean, and quiet, as it was on the backside of the building, my view was a wall and windows on another building. It suited all my needs just fine. Nice flat screen TV, comfortable bed, desk, decent size bathroom and closet. I had no complaints, it was perfect for me. The free wireless internet was a great amenity, and worked perfectly, I never lost the signal once. My only complaint about the room was the wake up call line always seemed to be busy, so I had to use the alarm to wake up, not a big deal though. It was a really nice alarm clock with an Ipod docking station. The hotel is small not just in rooms, but in size overall. The hallways are narrow and there's only one elevator (which I had no problems with). The front desk staff were all nice and helpful. The breakfast room, it didn't have many tables, but had a good selection of food, like cereal, yogurt, donuts, waffles, bagels, toast, coffee, juice, milk, and fruit. I always took my food back up to my room to eat, I also saw some people eating there's in the lobby. The business center has two computers and is open 24 hrs, as is the fitness center, but I didn't use that. There's two vending machines in the lobby, and the ice machine is in the basement, which is kind of creepy if your down there by yourself! There was a check in/out and flight check in self service kiosk in the lobby, I tried to get my boarding pass on it and it didn't work, but maybe it was just my airline, I don't know. I went into the business center and printed it off for no charge. The hotel's location is perfect, Times Square is only a minute's walk to the right, and the subway is a few minutes away. There always seemed to be cabs available out front, and there's restauraunts nearby. It's also a close walk/subway ride away to all attractions. I am glad I changed my reservation back to this hotel, as I had no regrets. I will definitely stay here again, I actually may change my reservation here for my next NYC trip in October. The price was great, but if you use the AAA rate, you do have to show your card at check in for them to give you the rate, there's a sign at th desk noting this, same for AARP rates I noticed. I'll definitely be back, and would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was a great stay!"
37,1778,"Aug 21 2009 	Great value great staff great location!	We stayed for three nights and enjoyed every moment of our stay. Yes the room was very small but it had all we needed. It was clean, comfortable and best of all, super close to everything. Just a short walk to Broadway, Restaurants, Parks and every thing that makes New York the exciting place that it is known for. We were quickly greeted with a friendly, smiling staff upon check in and the smiles continued throughout our entire stay.The breakfast area is small but has enough choices to please everyone. It is a continental breakfast. Again, let me mention that the room is very small but who goes to NYC to hang out in their hotel room? We have absolutely no complaints about this hotel or their staff and will without a doubt stay again. Except that next time, we will stay more nights. I highly recommend this hotel for it's value, comfort, convenience, cleanliness and friendly, helpful staff."
38,1778,"Aug 20 2009 	Horrible Check In experience!	When you book a hotel online and arrive with a printed confirmation, do you have confidence that the hotel will honor that? Don't be so sure if you make your reservations via Choice Hotels!I chose this hotel carefully after reading many reviews. It was a special occasion coming to NYC to celebrate my wife's birthday. We arrived at 11 PM exited and even planned a late dinner after check-in in a nice nearby restaurant.However the reception person printed a registration form with rates about $50 higher per night. When I showed him my printed confirmation letter which showed the original rates, he said there's nothing he can do and &quot;either sign the form withe higher rates or you cannot check in&quot;. We asked him to first get the room and then sort this out but he refused and even suggested that if we don't like those rates maybe look for another hotel, which I thought was outrageous! He then tried to call Choice Hotels. It took some 20 minutes of waiting to talk to them, and amazingly they declined my rates too! After finally talking with Choice Hotels supervisor, it turned out that my rates were raised &quot;because I called them to ask for a room facing the back-side&quot; to avoid street noise. Needless to say - they never mentioned it would change the rate, and the hotel does not charge any extra for that anyway. It was after midnight when we finally checked in after giving up and agreeing to sign the registration form. We were nervous and frustrated and had to dine in a fast food place since the restaurant already closed. The matter was settled only the following day, when Choice hotels customer service called me, admitted their mistake, reset the rates and said they'll even discount one of the nights to compensate me. It was unbelievable that when we finally checked out, that additional discount was forgotten! (we did not bother to fix that)The hotel management claimed it was all Choice Hotel's fault. I thought that the guy at the reception should have honored our letter, check us in and then sort this out instead of offering us to look elsewhere.Last - the hotel and room was very nice. Too bad it was overshadowed by the Check in experience."
39,1778,"Aug 16 2009 	Cheap and pratical choice	We stayed here for a week. It was a wonderful stay, good continental breakfast, clean rooms, and it stays less then a square from Times Square, you can go to many attractions by foot (Central Park, Macys, Rockfeller Center, St. Patrick Cathedral, 5th Av, Park Ave., Apple, Broadway, HB...), but if you preffer there are subway and bus station nearby. We'll certantly be staying here whenever we visit the city."
40,1778,"Aug 9 2009 	Hotel location was convenient and hotel was very clean	Upon arrival at Noon our room was already ready. The hotel was small and the room was tiny but I expected that. For the price the location couldn't be beat. The room and hotel were very clean. Parking was in a garage diagonally across the street and when stamped by the Comfort Inn cost only $23 for 24 hours. I'd highly recommend this hotel. Also, I'm very noise conscious and I found the hotel to be very quiet."
41,1778,Aug 5 2009 	Great location	We recently stayed at the Comfort Inn on 46th. It is very close to time square and many broadway shows and many restaurants. The location is great. The rooms were small but very clean. The breakfast was an added plus.
42,1778,"Jul 31 2009 	Great place Great Location	Room is very good. Great location, half block to main Times Square. Easy access to subway. simple breakfast (1 fruit, cereal, milk, yogurt, bread. that's it)"
43,1778,Jul 27 2009 	Cannot Beat This Place	Stayed here 21 til 25 July. This is the 2nd time I have stayed here since March and it has not disappointed me at all. I originally chose to stay here due to the excellent reviews on this site. I got a great rate of $149.99 falling to $129.99 and with free breakfast and free wi-fi this is such a fantastic price in the most central of locations. I agree with the reviewer who said the speed was above average as I had been in LA just before and the free wi-fi I got there was very slow. While I could not complain about my room last time this time it was even better as it was just set out more to my liking. The tv was facing the bed instead of being to the side of it and I had a shower cubicle instead of a bath/shower combi. They had very modern furnishing and it did appear like it had been newly renovated. It was serviced each day regardless of the time I left the room. Every member of staff I encountered were great and went out of their way. I am so glad I found this hotel as it has made it more affordable to come more often.It may not be the most modern of buildings from the outside but do not let that stop you. The St Andrews Restaurant and Bar opposite serves great food and the service was excellent. Loved the chinese food at John Shanghai just opposite and down slightly. Had a fantastic time and this will be my hotel of choice when in New York.
44,1778,"Jul 27 2009 	Excellent location Comfortable Quiet and Friendly	I rely heavily on TA for my travel plans; and, I will have to say that the positive reviews of this hotel were accurate. This was my first visit to NYC; and, the location is fantastic if you come to NYC to explore. There is a nearby Metro station and bus stops. We crammed alot in a few short days; so, the comfortable, clean, and quiet room we got made sleep instantaneous (I took a TA reviewer's advice and asked for a room in the back of the hotel...our room faced the back of the lovely church next door). Two reasonably priced nearby restaurants I recommend are: &quot;Utsav&quot; (very good Indian food) and &quot;Amarone&quot; (Italian...we went here before going to a Broadway show and loved it)."
45,1778,Jul 27 2009 	Great Place to Stay	My husband and I visited New York City for the first time at the end of July - I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the hotel. The rooms were not very big was it was more than sufficient seeing that I didn't go to New York City to stay in the room. We were given a room in the back of the hotel - it was very quiet but absolutely no view. Would I stay at this hotel again - definitely yes. It was very close to Time Square and a lot of the attractions were in walking distance.
46,1778,"Jul 27 2009 	We found a gem!	Staying in Times Square doesn't have to cost a fortune. This newly renovated hotel is just steps away, includes a very decent continental breakfast and the rooms, while not that large, are very clean, up-to-date and comfortable. We'll be staying here whenever we visit the city."
47,1778,"Jul 23 2009 	Friendly hotel great location friendly and helpful staff	We stayed here for two nights in July 2009. Unlike most NYC hotels, this one was quiet and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room size would have been small anywhere besides Manhattan, but everything was so conveniently arranged that we were very comfortable. Nice bedside reading lamps and iPod compatible radio. Plus the wireless Internet signal was much stronger than most hotels. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and apparently fairly recently refurbished. Nice free breakfast. And you couldn't beat the location if you want to be near Times Square. Plus the price was extremely reasonable. I've already recommended this hotel to several friends. If you stay here, check out O'Briens Irish Pub across the street and Connolly's around the corner on 45th."
48,1778,"Jul 20 2009 	Great Value	I agree with the other posts. This is a great value in an excellent location. Times Square is around the corner. Restaurant Row is a block away on the other side of Times Square. Many theaters are close. NBC and Radio City are two blocks away. This is just a great central location. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was very small but recently renovated. Breakfast was simple, but it was all we needed. I would certainly stay here again."
49,1778,"Jul 16 2009 	Great hotel in convenient location	All of the previous reviews are right - this is a great hotel value on a street right off of Times Square. Rooms are small, as expected in NYC, but they are beautifully furnished - really a notch better than you would expect from a Comfort Inn. Staff is friendly and goes out of their way to help you. The fellow in the breakfast room was especially helpful. And free breakfast in NYC is a great perk! Both the room and the public areas were extremely clean, too. This place is such a bargain for tourists and theatergoers alike."
50,1778,"Jul 15 2009 	Great hotel amazing location	From the moment I checked in, I could tell that this hotel was going to be good. Clean, fresh looking lobby area, friendly staff and an effecient check in process.The negative points: Rooms were a bit darkElevator is a bit slowThe street outside smeels a bit sometimesShower is loud.Those are the only negative points I can think of, positives:Spacious roomsFree WifiGreat locationNice breakfast24 hour business centreIn room safesFree phone calls within USAModern furnishingsVery comfy bedsGood air conditioningRooms serviced daily- clean towels etc.Overall an excellent hotel that I look forward to staying at again. I really couldn't fault the whole stay apart from a minor incident at check-out but thats not worth mentioning.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to any of my friends!"
51,1778,Jul 8 2009 	Great Place!	This place totally exceeded my expectations. The room was clean and furnishings were all very nice. Location was awesome. I would stay here again.
52,1778,"Jun 8 2009 	COMFORT INN lived up to the reviews	We just got back today from NYC and stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown from 06/03 -06/08. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The rooms were small, but in NYC I was expecting that. We asked for the largest room we could get away from the street and they obliged. I slept well, but did notice you have to be very careful with the doors because they slam easily . There was only 1 elevator, but we only chose to walk down the stairs once and that was only because I was scared I might be late for the Lion King. I wasn't. The staff was excellent and they were always asking us if we needed anything when we came downstairs. The breakfast was great. It was fruit, cold cereals, toast., danish, bagels, toaster waffles, boiled eggs, ect. I wish they had a microwave though. I do not like cold boiled eggs. I loved the whole wheat toast! The breakfast room is small, but I would always go up to a table that had 1 or 2 sitting at it and ask to sit down, so the wait was never long. All and all we will stay here again. It has LOCATION,. LOCATION, LOCATION right in Times Square and close to subway. I am glad we chose it!Staff directed us to Rosie O' Grady's and we ate there twiceOne of the greatest amenities they offer is that they will homd your suitcase until your room is ready, so we were able to go into Times Square while they readied our room!"
53,1778,"Jun 8 2009 	Great experience	We stayed in this property back in March 2009 for total of 5 nights and we were delighted with our stay. No wonder they have so many good reviews - it's truely a great choice of hotel when in Manhattan (Times Sq area). What we didn't like in the hotel was: 1. the rooms are really tiny - especially those not facing the street but this is not unusual in NYC hotels. The window we had was kinda fake cause it was facing the wall of another building, there was almost no daylight in the room due to that and it was very hot, but again it was also quiet. Also, you can't even open the window and have to rely on the airconditioning. 2. The A/C is very noisy and not great - sort of like too powerfull, it was soon very cold and &quot;windy&quot; in the room once it was on. But iit might be a good thing when the summer's hot... 3. Staying there is not the cheapest - but you pay for the area. We also found a great deal on hotels own website - they had a way better deal than all major hotel booking sites so definitely check it out! And now the things we liked and made our stay so pleasant: 1. the rooms &amp; bathrooms are spotless clean, the cleaning staff are doing a great job! 2. we also enjoyed free continental breakfast - again the staff in the breakfast room are very efficient, very nice and helpfull, the place is clean, food is great - good choice (yogurts, juices, tea &amp; coffee, waffles, bagles, pastries, donuts, fresh fruit etc.) &amp; always very fresh &amp; yummy. the tea &amp; coffee is there all day long and you can take a cup to your room in the afternoon etc. 3. location is great - 2 mins from times sq, you can walk everywhere, to all major attractions, shops, sightseeing double-deckers etc. There's also plenty of good and not so expensive restaurants and bars (e.g. 2 Irish bars just opposite hotel), good quality take-aways etc. 4. There's also a tiny business centre (PCs, fax, printers, internet) at the hotel and it's all free of charge - e.g. we always travel with a laptop (free wifi) but we leave the printer at home;) - if you need to print your broadway tickets or other confirmations - you can do it for free in this hotel. very convenient I have to say if you're booking your attractions online and last minute. 5. They also have iPod docking stations in rooms - well done! wasn't expecting this and was delighted:) All in all we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it. In our case there were a lot more advantages than disadvantages - I only mentioned them to give you a fair review:) Would definitely go back there!"
54,1778,"May 31 2009 	It's All Good!	Stayed at this hotel after finding it here on Trip Advisor. It was clean, convenient and well priced. Less than a block from Times Square. Great breakfast; great staff; very clean and great value for the money."
55,1778,"May 31 2009 	You cant beat the location and the staff are great.	We stayed here twice in May, and it is a great place to stay, just around the corner from Times Square but in a quiet and safe street. Sure, the rooms are small, but they are clean, well appointed and modern. We stayed in king rooms, and I would recommend the rooms facing the street as they are larger and lighter. There is a little noise in the street facing room, mainly early in the morning when the gargage trucks go by, but most of the time it is not a problem. There is a flatscreen TV in the room, coffee and tea making facilities, plenty of drawer space, and the bed is very comfortable. Wifi is free in the rooms and throughout the hotel, and also a computer room with 2 printers for guest use which is great for those travelling without laptops. The breakfast is great, cereal, toast, a range of pastries and bagels, waffles, boiled eggs, fresh fruit, juice and coffee. Coffee and Tea is available in the breakfast room throughout the day. As others have commented, the breakfast room is small, but we never had to wait long for a table and most days didn't have to wait long at all. The staff member working in the breakfast room is very friendly, makes sure the food is replenished regularly and keeps the area clean. We found all the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful, and they will securely store your luggage if you have a late flight etc. The location here is fantastic, and while the rooms may be small, it is New York and value for money this is a great hotel. Highly recommend !"
56,1778,"May 28 2009 	Can't improve on near-perfection planning my 4th stay....	I've been looking through Trip Advisor and elsewhere for affordable Manhattan hotels for our upcoming long weekend in New York City, and I think I finally realized that one can't improve on near-perfection. That's why my choice will be, for the fourth time in five years, this comfy, well-priced (for New York!) hotel in the best location in the City! The rooms are clean, comfortable, and attractive, and the staff is very attentive, (and like other reviewers mentioned, the same staff members seem to be there every year, including the gentleman who mans the busy breakfast area and is very attentive to his job.) We find you just can't beat the location, price, and free breakfast. My husband loves to get up early every morning and run around the corner to Rockefeller Center to see the Today Show. We've walked easily to Broadway shows, seen the Naked Cowboy on Times Square a couple of hundred yards away, and dined at the excellent restaurants in the area (great Italian restaurant across the street and the Scottish Saint Andrews Pub with affordable dinners and wonderful atmosphere around the corner.) We've easily caught the nearby subway to Central Park, the Village, and Battery Park. It has always been home away from home for us, and we truly appreciate this great little hotel."
57,1778,"May 17 2009 	Comfort Inn Midtown was a winner!	It is a bit risky choosing an inexpensive hotel in a good location in NYC. The Comfort Inn Midtown was a real winner for us. First of all, location was perfect - a half block off of Times Square. Next best thing was the friendly and very helpful staff. How pleasant it was to NOT see signs of frustrated, tired empolyees. They all went out of their way to offer help - especially &quot;Sidibi&quot; the bellhop. The rooms were crisp &amp; clean and nicely furnished. Not all rooms were spacious like ours. We at first were assigned to a rather small room toward the back part of the hotel. We simply asked if there was another room with more space or a window view. They said there was (a handicap room), but that it was not yet ready. We gladly waited (sightseeing on Times Square). We were given room 602 with 2 windows with a view. Four days later 602 was needed for a handicap person and we gladly moved to 802. They actually moved all our things for us to the new room so that we could be on our way . Both rooms were spcaious and comfortable with lots of closet &amp; drawer space. But keep in mind - this is New York where space is at a premium. About the only complaint we had was that the dining area was too small. But the food was good. So yes I would definitely go back to this hotel - and ask for a front room facing the street. We did not have any street noise the whole week we were there."
58,1778,"May 16 2009 	Great location 	At $175/nt using AAA this must be the best bargain in Manhattan! Rooms are tastefully updated, with desk, flat screen TV and nice lighting. We had room 500, view of a brick wall but very quiet. Rest of family had street facing rooms, 501 &amp; 601, that were larger but also had street noise. Nice continental breakfast, fruit, yogurt, bagels, pastries, toaster waffles, juice, and coffee in a small room, but we took our coffee to the nicely appointed lobby. Two computers for internet. The staff are very helpful and courteous. Only 1 block to Times Square, and theater district. Multiple subway stops nearby-get a map from the front desk.Try the Grey Line bus tours when the feet wear out. Lots of restaurant on W. 46th. Try the Havanna Club a few doors down."
59,1778,May 11 2009 	Fabulous	Extremly good vbalue for money...good breakfast and very courteous staff
60,1778,May 6 2009 	Best Bang for the Buck	Stayed here about 16 months ago. The same lady who worked the front desk last time was still there and remembered me. Also the man who takes care of the continental breakfast area was there from 16 months ago. The fact that both employees were still there speaks well for the hotel in my opinion. Make sure you ask for a room NOT facing the street as it can be very noisy in the middle of the night otherwise. Rooms in the rear of the hotel are quiet though. I would reccommend this hotel for the excellent location and clean comfortable rooms. Rate I booked one month before trip was $189 a night. Two days before I left I checked on-line and the rate had dropped to $149 a night and I called and they adjusted the rate for me no problem.
61,1778,"May 6 2009 	Best Hotel in New York City!	My teenage daughter and I make a yearly trip to NYC to shop and see Broadway shows and for the past 3 years we have stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown! The location is wonderful, rooms are comfy and quiet and service is great! My only complaint is the frosted bathroom doors and we fix that problem by getting brochures from the lobby and taping them to the door for privacy!! A great hotel for a great price!"
62,1778,"May 5 2009 	Location - Great Staff - Location	excellent location, the staff is impeccable, I strongly recommend, when you return to NY I will be in the same hotel, so need to repair the elevator and it does not have air conditioning and e very slow, with regard to the rooms and bathrooms are good and very clean and spotless"
63,1778,May 3 2009 	Location - Location - Location	Just returned May 2 with teenage son. This was the perfect place. Just as good as hotels that charge 2 or 3x more. Room updated and clean. Bed very comfy. Absolutely no problems. Everything very close within walking distance. When returning to New York will stay at this hotel. Jovannie at the front desk very helpful and pleasant. In fact all staff very friendly. Like someone said before a hidden gem in the middle of New York.
64,1778,"May 2 2009 	Great Location and Staff	Just can't beat the location, one a half block from the center of Times Square. Very comfortable older hotel. Breakfast was good, clean and its the spot. I can't say enough about the staff - they were terrific."
65,1778,"May 1 2009 	Great hotel very kind staff and great location!!	We stayed four days in hotel. We were surprised how near is Times Square! We had even a breakfast included in price of acommodation, what is not usually for hotels in NYC. The room was very quite. The staff were very helpfull and kind. We would definietly recommend this hotel and we will probably come back one day in the most beautifull town in world, of course in this hotel!!!:-)"
66,1778,"Apr 28 2009 	The Best	We have just returned from NYC and staying in Times Square. This our second visit to this hotel. We had a mini family reunion here and all 8 of us were very pleased with everything about this hotel. The staff in fantastic! Helpful in many ways, 4 or five of the same people as 2 yrs ago, nice to see a familar face. Continal B-Fast is nice bagels, donuts, cereal and fruit. Location is GREAT! Staff had our room clean everytime we got back from seeing the city. Gave great recommendations for eating and directions. All the staff we encountered here made our stay perfect. RonP"
67,1778,Apr 26 2009 	excellent hotel	i stayed in the comfort inn for 6 nights 14th-20th april staff were great rooms cleaned and fresh towels every day close to everything just a few minutes to times square would deff stay here again would recommend to anyone looking for a clean comfortable hotel in the centre of new york
68,1778,"Apr 20 2009 	What a pleasant surprise!	We were looking for a comfortable, affordable, conveniently located, clean hotel. Comfort Inn Midtown turned out to be all that we had hoped. The location 1 block from Times Square was amazing, but the hotel itself seemed enough off the beaten path to not be hectic or loud. Sure there was some traffic noise, but you're in a big city. The hotel has 70 rooms or so on 9 compact floors -central elevator separates the floor into 2 wings with 5 or 6 rooms per wing. Nice features - clean, comfortable bed, continental breakfast, friendly, helpful staff, access to free wireless in room and printer accessibility in small business center. Would definitely stay there again."
69,1778,"Apr 18 2009 	Great location great room low price for NYC	We have stayed a the Comfort Inn for 4 nights. Last time we were in the Casablanca and we got some serious pampering there, so we were prepared to be slightly disappointed. We were dead wrong. While not at the same level of comfort than the Casablanca, we got:PROS:1) Top notch Service, always with a smile. Geovanni (not spelled like this, but you know who you are) spent almost an hour solving a problem we had with the airline. Thanks from Ignacio (Argentina).2) Great, clean and big (for NYC standards) room, the most comfortable bed I've ever experienced at a hotel (and I've stayed at a LOT of them), great LCD TV, clean and decently sized bathroom, hot water at all times. 3) Decent continental buffet breakfast, you get coffee, tea, milk, danish, pastries, bagels, cream cheese, jam, butter, orange and apple juice, 3 types of cereals, yogurts, apples and bananas.4) Location, location, location, 1 block to broadway, 2 block to Times Sq. Great.5) Beautiful &quot;old school&quot; lobby.6) Free local and long distance calls (within the US) from your room. Free Wi-Fi.7) Some amenities we didn't have the chance to use but were available: 24 hour open gym, clean and with 3-4 new machines (we got plenty of exercise walking around); office center, and very cheap (again, for NYC standards) parking.(MINOR) CONS:1) The glass door at the bathroom can be a nuisance.2) The heating system can get noisy at times.3) Some renovations were undergoing and the entire facade was covered in scaffolds. Guess it will take some weeks for them to come off.4) Breakfast lounge can be packed and you would have to wait for your turn to sit and have your breakfast. Be there early!All in all, you can't beat it for the price. It gets a thumbs up from me. Enjoy!"
70,1778,"Apr 5 2009 	I have found my favorite NYC hotel but that bathroom door...	If I ever return to New York City, this is were I will stay! The room was bigger than I imagined, everything was new and it had the best TV I've ever had in a hotel room (though we didn't use it much). I think it was about a size 40&quot; or bigger flat-screen TV. For you iPod owners, the room also has an iHome instead of a cheap clock radio, NICE! There are plenty of electrical plugs everywhere and FREE Wi-Fi. If you wake up early enough (we didn't) there's free continental breakfast provided downstairs and free newspaper. The hotel has a small but FREE gym that provides water and towels.We had a king size bed that I miss to this day, SO comfortable!Service was, for the most part, excellent except for at check-in the Asian guy that helped us had accidentally overcharged our credit card for close to 10 times the amount he was supposed to and didn't tell us. Halfway through our vacation we discovered a few thousand dollars were charged instead of a few hundred and we were in a panic! We thought we were in New York without any money. After talking with the bank all was settled but it was still 30 minutes of stress that could have been avoided. After a deep sigh of relief, all was forgiven and our vacation continued.The bathroom door is as see-through as a foggy window! We didn't mind it except whenever I had to, you know, sit down. I would do this with the lights off to have as much privacy as possible. If you're not comfortable with the people you're staying with this bathroom door is gonna be tough times for you. I also wished the hotel provided conditioner, all they had was shampoo.The room can get pretty warm so expect to run that cooler at night.Location, Location, Location!!!!Located between Times Square and Rockefeller Center it is PERFECT! Right in the middle of the city and close to everything. Across the street is the St. Andrews Pub, we fell in love with this place and we usually went there before bed every night. Conner is the bartender there, he's a nice guy and gives great service.My only complaints were:-the credit card &quot;woops&quot; which I'm sure won't happen again.-the room gets warm-the bathroom door being see-through-the Dasani Water machine in the lobby is tricky-no conditioner-Bathroom sink water.. the Cold is freezing the Hot is clear lava"
71,1778,"Apr 3 2009 	My place to stay when in NYC..	For the price, this was a perfect place to stay. I took my 2 teen sons for a springbreak trip to visit the city. I love the location! Several different options of subways nearby. Close enough to Time Square but not too close. Felt very safe. Rooms were quiet. Elevator was slow, but it's an old building with a small elevator. We walked up the three flights of stairs whenever we could. Free internet to check HOPSTOP.com for directions. The rooms are small but I've stayed in smaller. All udated and clean. Beds must be new because they were comfortable! Staff was 100% friendly and helpful."
72,1778,"Mar 28 2009 	Clean and comfortable--great location and value.	I concur with previous reviewer. Clean, comfortable room. Great mid-week rates considering location---1/2 block from Times Square. Hotel is not much to look at from exterior, but inside looks fresh. We requested room away from street. No view to speak of but it was quiet. Staff was very courteous. Check booking rates frequently as they fluctuate widely. Parking for guests across the street was also less than many other hotels at $23/day. I would stay here again."
73,1778,"Mar 24 2009 	EXCELLENT. Great rate beautiful room 9 floors and CLOSE to times square.	READ THIS POST...we tell all! I would definitely stay in this hotel again. The reference about the glass bathroom doors in the rooms in another post, isn't bad at all. They are not see through there is privacy. I wouldn't make this a first date hotel or anything. Very CLOSE to times square, LOVELY beds...slept great! Beautiful main level and up to date remodeling throughout. The maid service was very nice. There is vending machines with water and soda in the lobby. There is an ice machine. Great breakfast in the morning. Great room temperature. Flat screen TV's. Ipod docking stations for alarm clocks. We paid very low price and would stay here again! Wish we remembered to take photos to share. BUT very great stay, you will not regret it AT ALL! Oh and there is luggage storage if you need to check out and still see the city. Close to the MoMa and International Photography Museum. Close to 5th avenue shopping. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Free internet!"
74,1778,"Mar 23 2009 	Super value for very clean comfortable hotel in great location	My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown last weekend and had a great stay. The check in was quick and friendly, the room was spotless (room 806) with a king size bed, small but efficient and clean modern washroom with shower. The bed and linens were better than I expected, the room was quiet, and the window opened. There was not much of a view, but because the hotel is right beside a church, it was very quiet. The parking was $23/day, which is a great find, and the room was an even better deal. Phoning the hotel directly, with CAA we paid $139/nt right on Times Square! I was worried with such a bargain, but it worked out fabulously(and I am one of those travellers who goes on Tripadvisor and puts the worst reviews first....if I see bugs or hair I'm outta there!). I will guaranteed stay there again. The rooms are not fancy, but they are clean, modern, flat screen tv's and a simple breakfast which gets you through the morning to that great lunch in Greenwich or LIttle Italy!The staff was equally great. No problems wtih check in, no billing issues, and when we had problems with our in room safe, they arranged to put our stuff behind the front desk securely while waiting for the serviceguy to arrive from somewhere in the building. So no delay in our touring! When we returned, it was all fixed and we picked up our things from the front desk with no problems.I highly reccommend the Comfort Inn Midtown!"
75,1778,Mar 22 2009 	good value clean hotel	great deal rooms clean and efficient--small but who cares in nyc--staff friendly--breakfast very good--computer in lobby---fantastic location and cheap parking--will stay here everytime im in nyc
76,1778,"Mar 20 2009 	awesome NYC experience	My friend and i stayed here for 5 nights and it was our first time in NYC. The location was great. A few minutes from Times Square and just several more to Rockerfella Centre. It was at the heart of it all.We had the room with a King size bed which made the room a bit cramped but that was minor. The bed was comfy, the toilet was clean and newly renovated i think.We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast too. For a complimentary meal, the selection was good. The guy taking care of the area is a nice fellow, making sure the food is topped up. He's always there to greet you :)The business centre has free internet and a printer with free printing which came in handy when we needed to print online tickets to attractions etc.We had a nice and enjoyable experience. Thanks Comfort Inn =)"
77,1778,"Mar 16 2009 	Mom and daughter getaway	I stayed at the Comfort Inn Midtown for two nights early in March with my teenage daughter. If you demand Four Seasons type amenities stop reading now. However, if you are looking for a clean, safe, very well located room, that includes a light breakfast, in Manhattan for, get this, $135.00/night, then your search is over. I won't stay in a dump, or in a place where I feel unsafe, and I can't believe the value for money here. I would much rather stay in a simple room and buy my own luxury toiletries with the money I've saved! Oh, and did I mention the free wireless internet? Our two bedded room had a, shall we say, European standard of space. In other words, it was the smallest room I've ever stayed in in this country. It also seemed a bit drab at first glance because there was no natural light in the room; even though the room faced front the window was taken up by the climate control system. Upon closer examination however, everything in the room was newish, in excellent repair, and perfectly clean. The bathroom was also clean and modern. I am a big city resident, so I wasn't bothered by outside noise, but have to admit that the plumbing from other rooms was a bit annoying, but bearable. The location is terrific on 46th Street between 6th and 7th...Broadway and theatreland one block to the right, 5th Avenue and shopping one block to the left, restaurants everywhere. The staff seemed friendly, although I had no reason to ask for their help. One tip, it you book using a AAA or AARP discount, make sure you have your card with you! I carry mine routinely, but have never actually been asked for it at check-in but was here.  Minor quibbles aside, I would absolutely stay here again. At prices like this I will be able to visit NYC more often!"
78,1778,"Mar 12 2009 	Comfortable  great value	My teenaged daughter and I have enjoyed a three night stay in February at this hotel for the past three years. We like seeing the same friendly and accomodating staff members year after year. We arrived quite early from the airport (8:30ish) and the desk staff said a room would be ready around 11:00, and offered us breakfast and held our bags till we returned from a walk. (They will hold your bags after check-out, too, until you are ready for transportation to airport.) The room is very comfortable and clean. We shared a king-sized bed, and room size is comfortable for two people. Bedding is nice. Bathroom is clean. Towels were a little scratchy. Complimentary continental breakfast is a real plus; food is good and the service person is very attentive. We love the location-close to theaters, shopping &amp; the subway. We visit in February because the rates are lower; we have lots of fun despite the cold. We feel safe here. It is about 1/2 block down 46th St. from Times Square. Entrance is well lit and there's always someone at the front desk. I would heartily recommend this hotel, and hope to visit again."
79,1778,"Mar 7 2009 	Fantastic value and great staff	Location and VALUE is as good as it gets for those headed to Broadway shows. Short walk away from subway stations, restaurants, Broadway, and Central Park is totally walkable. Staff is super friendly and accomodating, and the rooms though small (of course they are -- it's Manhattan!!) are clean and elegant with all the expected amenities including a nice flat-screen TV. Beds are comfy, bathroom has a full bathtub. Included breakfast is great for a continental breakfast, though you might want to grab coffee down the street. Location is decently quiet, excellent for that area of Manhattan. Definitely, definitely would come back here and highly recommend to all friends.The perfect hotel for couples and groups of friends on tight budgets, but not wanting to sacrifice on comfort or lifestyle.jt"
80,1778,"Mar 5 2009 	Great location and price for NY	We stayed in a one bedroom room for 6 nights in February 2009. We were located on the 5th floor.Positives The location of this hotel is awesome. I think this Comfort Inn should be renamed to the Times Square Comfort Inn instead of Midtown because Time Square was just at the end of our street.  Hotel offered free wireless therefore could connect from your room (given you have your own laptop). The wireless speed was really quick too. They also provided a business centre area available 24hrs and could use their pcs for internet and printer for printing. Rooms were cleaned everyday although I dont think sheets were changed every day.  We had a closet in our room which was a bonus, we utilised this space to store our luggage.  Safe was available in room  An ipod docking station was also available so we could play tunes but we mostly used it to recharge our iphone Free breakfast was included with stay. Comfort Inn provided different types of breads, pastries and cereal as well as coffee and juices. There was a small gym area which was accessible 24hrs. There was a treadmill, bike and stepper but their equipment and was old. There was a group of kids staying next door and were mucking around the hall way knocking on each others door. We called and complained to the front desk and believe they resolved issue as noise and children ceased slamming doors soon after. Room was very quiet could not hear street noise. Flat screen tv with cable was available The staff and service we experience was very good. During our stay we also experienced (at different times) a broken smoke alarm which kept beeping every couple of seconds and we managed to block our toilet as well. Each time concierge was more than willing to assist us and resolved the issues seamlessly.  The cost of Comfort Inn Time Square was a lot cheaper than other hotels in the area definitely value for money staying here. Negatives Rooms are small but everyone who has stayed here and posted past reviews weve read has mentioned that so it was no surprised.  Room needs a revamp of modern sleek furniture to utilise the limited space more effectively. We had a big wooden dressing table and a big wooden side table in our room which we didnt use. Changing linen and curtains wouldnt hurt either. Room lighting was a dull probably cause of the colour of the walls and lack of natural lighting available. There was a small window in our room which gave us the view of a brick wall. Room walls are pretty thin can hear neighbours music, but then again we did have teenagers next door who liked to play music at 1am when it should be dead quiet. Radiator needs updating. When on it makes a whistling noise when it is heating or cooling which would wake my husband up at night. When we turned it up it would be too hot once we turned it down it took forever to a point we would turn on the aircon. Elevators were slow and could only fit probably 4-5 people at a timeId stay at Comfort Inn again because of its prime location to Times Square and the competitive cost."
81,1778,"Feb 26 2009 	Great choice for a mom and daughter getaway	I hadn't visited NYC since before having my kids. My oldest was about to turn 13 and had always wanted to try shopping on 5th Avenue so I decided to take the plunge. Was a bit nervous about navigating the city so I chose this hotel, right around the corner from Times Sq and within a 15 min. walk from Penn Station where we would be arriving.We showed up at noon, long before the official check-in time, and the front desk allowed us to go right up to our room. They also stored our bags for a few hours after we checked out on our last day. Everything was clean. The room was a bit cramped with 2 double beds but we were comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and professional.I can't say enough about how convenient the location was. We walked to the Gershwin Theatre to see Wicked, which I highly recommend. Very clever story, fabulous special effects. Also within a few blocks, we went shopping up and down 5th and 6th Avenues, visited St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Rockefeller Center, M&amp;M World, the Plaza Hotel lobby, and more. Plenty of fast food and family style restaurants all around, and lots of foot traffic so I felt safe each time we went out somewhere.This hotel is reliable and a good value. I don't think we could have found a better deal, for our needs."
82,1778,"Feb 16 2009 	A great find!	Ok, so bearing in mind that this is midtown New York City - and a few minutes walk from all those attractions - and also that I paid less than 120 bucks a night, this hotel is a bit of a wonder.I was in NYC alone, and on business and I was SICK. So I really didn't want to be anywhere dodgy or uncomfortable, but couldn't afford to pay to be anywhere plush. My main concern was cleanliness and security and I was very satisfied on both counts. The decor was actually really nice and I appreciated the widescreen television and the desk with free national calls, free internet and coffee maker. The fact that they must have done a refurb recently was great; no yucky carpet stains, grubby headboard or smelly bedcover. I have certainly been in supposedly posher chain hotels that have been way scruffier and pokier (hello Hilton!) . The bathroom wasn't quite as nice as the bedroom, but still acceptably clean, if not brand new. Bit of a smell of disinfectant, but perfectly ok.Noise was a slight issue; I am very sensitive to noise but was pleased to have a room away from the front of the building and therefore quiet. The only problem was another guest's tv - not my neighbour, but someone down the corridor! It was on soooo loudly...but luckily not for long, or I would have complained. The heating isn't ideal - it was a little clanky, but not enough to bother me - but the room did heat up too much in the night. Not unbearably and I'd rather have that than too cold in January. Breakfast was good value - lots of it, bagels, cereal, juice, pastries. The guys on reception were friendly and efficient and there was a free luggage store on check out which I used.My only major gripe was a smell of cigars/strong cigarettes that I smelt twice at around 5am in my room. I don't think it was anyone on my floor, but I wondered if the smoke was coming in from a lower floor or the alleyway...? It was a mystery. Once again, luckily for me the smell passed within minutes. Maybe it was a ghost?All in all, if I wanted to be so near to Times Square again and couldn't afford to splash out, I would definitely stay here another time. For the money, you can't beat it."
83,1778,"Feb 10 2009 	Loved Comfort Inn Midtown!!!!	I stayed at the Comfort Inn on 46th Street for one week last August (2008) and was very happy with my choice! The hotel is PERFECTLY positioned. You are right at Times Square and in walking distance to The Rock, Radio City, Broadway ... and the rest is a few minutes on the subway. The rooms were very clean and the staff were excellent and very helpful from the front desk to the very nice cleaning staff and concierge. My room had it's own air con, which you did need in summer and it wasn't too noisy. A light breakfast is included every morning and it was great to have that handy. They have a small gym (not that you will want to look at it after all the walking you'll do around the city - take comfortable shoes!!!!!!) and they also have computers handy for you to check email/internet, free and that was very handy. I would definitely stay here again. I found them very hard to beat for price and as I was travelling alone, it was nice that they had a 24 hr desk, I felt safe at all times. Highly recommend them for those with a moderate budget that want clean rooms and somewhere well positioned."
84,1778,"Feb 8 2009 	Good Option in Manhattan	I and my wife stayed at the Comfort Inn in the winter of 2009 and it was definitely a good choice.The accommodations are small and simple but very clean and comfortable. The location is great, at the heart of times square and close to several subway stations. The staff is friendly, the complimentary breakfast is quite monotonous but honest and the free wi fi internet works fine.As other reviewer have already written, I didn`t like the glass bathroom door and the heat in the room that made us to turn on the A/C in the middle of winter. I also miss the ice machine at the room floor, since it was only available at the basement.Thanks to the location, price, breakfast and Internet, I totally recommend this hotel. The cost/ benefit for New York City is very good. But don't ask for the Queen bedroom. It is very small!"
85,1778,"Jan 27 2009 	Handy friendly clean hotel	Girlfriends and I returned for our 3rd year for our Broadway weekend and were not disappointed. Friendly staff put us all on the 9th floor in our various individual and shared rooms. Still clean and up to date. We stumbled down to the breakfast room in the am for coffee, tea, juice, fruit, bagels, yogurt or cereal until about 10 am. Same staff for all 3 years and that is something itself! The newly refurbished building, complete with flat screen TVs, wireless access, 2 communal computers with printer, and fitness room is in good shape.I can never figure out why this is the Comfort Inn Midtown as it is a half block from the TKTS park off Times Square, when the Comfort Inn Times Square is nowhere near Times Square. Easy walk to everywhere from 46th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue. I walked from Penn Station up 6th in about 20 minutes with my wheelie suitcase. It was also easy to go 2 blocks to the subway at Times Square to take the shuttle over to Grand Central and transfer to the line going up the East Side. Taxis are easy to come by in the neighborhood.My only things to improve would be the heat - so warm we didn't use the blankets as it seemed silly to turn on the AC when it was 10 degrees out. Not crazy about the frosted glass bathroom doors and the oversized bureau in the doubles and the one pokey elevator. But for the price, cleanliness and location, it can't be beat, (and we have tried ) so we keep coming back."
86,1778,"Jan 22 2009 	Great Hotel excellent location and value	My daughter and I just returned from 14 nights at the Comfort Inn and we thought it was fabulous. We were very close to Times Square and it was a 5 minute walk to lots of theatres. Being centrally located we walked most places, including Central Park, the Met, Museum of Natural History, Empire State Building Madison Square Garden etc. The bed was comfortable and the room was bigger than you would expect a New York room to be. It was also very clean, with towels changed daily. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. They couldn't do enough for us. The breakfast each morning was good as well. I couldn't recommend this hotel highly enough and would definitely stay there again."
87,1778,"Jan 15 2009 	Perfect Location Great Value Clean Hotel	This was my third trip to New York and the best Hotel i have stayed in to-date. The Hotel is only seconds away from Time Square so its location couldn't be better. On arrival at 2.30pm, the room was ready and the staff were very prompt and friendly, also giving us advice on the following night New Years Eve. The room was spotless clean as was the bathroom. The room was cleaned daily with fresh towels etc provided. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room size was adequate and bigger than some of the other hotels in New York. It also had a wall mounted flat screen TV. The breakfast provided was a nice touch and the staff member for breakfast was extremely polite and helpful. If a particular flavor of item wasn't on display he got it immediately. There was free internet provided and a small gym on the ground floor. The hotel was also reasonable priced for the time of year and location. I will definitely stay here on my next visit."
88,1778,"Jan 9 2009 	great location great experience	The Hotel has an great location, everyone was really kind to us, the size of the room is not so small as lots of reviews, we have a early check-inn and late check-out with no problem and everyone really tried to give all the help and informations we need.... I strongly recommend this hotel....."
89,1778,"Jan 5 2009 	Perfect Location	I booked this Hotel using my points with Choice Privileges for one of the coldest weekends of the year ending in 2008 (Zero*), the Hotel was in the PERFECT location in NYC, the room was very comfortable, very warm, and up to date, especially the bathroom for the wife. You will not be disappointed with your stay at this Hotel and yes I will return to this Hotel for further trips to NY City in the future."
90,1778,"Dec 24 2008 	Excellent Location	Myself and 3 others went to New York on December 3rd, and could not believe how close to Time Square our hotel was when we arrived. We had two rooms booked, one was to the side of the hotel and the other was onto the street at the front of the hotel. Our room was very quiet at night but alas the bigger room which was to the front was not, but if you shopped like we did you slept at night regardless. The staff at the hotel where very helpfull and even let us have our room till 1pm on the day of check out. The hotel was clean and there was a breakfast room in the moring where you could have a bagel or cereal and you could get tea or coffee all day here as well. Would have no problem recommending this hotel to others."
91,1778,"Dec 23 2008 	great weekend getaway!	My friends &amp; I have stayed here several times. It is centrally located and very convenient. We were very pleased to find the rooms have recently been renovated. It was very warm in the room, as the front desk controls the heat. No problem - we put on the AC and we got very comfortable. The one and only downfall to the renovations is that they put a glass door on the bathroom. Although it is frosted, you can still see through it. But even worse is that when you are with three other people and you have a whold day planned, someone has to get into the shower very early. As soon as you put the light on in the bathroom the whole room lights up!!! I have to say that was a stupid move on the hotels planning. But that was our only complaint. And I'll guarantee that we'll probably stay there next year. Can't wait!!!"
92,1778,"Dec 12 2008 	Clean and consistent	There's a reason the Comfort Inn Midtown in NYC rates number 37 out of 400 hotels rated on TripAdvisor, and that's location. It's just one block from Times Square, close to Rockefeller Center and St. Patrick's Cathedral, and about ten blocks from Sak's Fifth Avenue and Macy's at Herald Square. My wife and I stayed here for the third time in four years and found it to be consistently clean and orderly. If a king sized bed is ok with you, book one instead of a room with two beds. We've found room rates to be more for two beds (presumably because guests will try to sleep more than two people in two beds). The free breakfast has no frills and gets boring after a few days. There's free Internet off from the lobby to check your e-mail or surf. Our only complaint this visit was the excessive heat in our room. Seems foolish to have to run the window air conditioner in the middle of winter, during a time when we're all trying to conserve energy."
93,1778,"Dec 9 2008 	A hidden gem!	We stayed in the Comfort Inn Midtown at the start of December 2008 having decided to book here after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. When we arrived at the hotel I didnt realise how close we actually were to Times Square but we would never have known it once we were inside the hotel and had checked into our 7th floor room. The staff were great and check-in a breeze, the room was amazingly quiet and had everything we needed, it had a flat screen tv, built-in wardrobe, free safe, tea &amp; coffee making facilities and I loved the heated floor in the bathroom :-) We have both stayed in Hilton hotels in the UK where the rooms didnt even come close to the standard and cleanliness of our room at the Comfort Inn Midtown. We were both more than happy with our accomodation.Also, the location cannot be beaten, you are literally a few steps away from Times Square and all the major tourist sites are within walking distance, Central Park, Madison Sqaure Garden, Empire State Building etc and there is a great Irish Bar opposite the Hotel!!We would both definately stay at this hotel again, thank-you AppleCore Hotels for making our first stay in New York City so memorable for all the right reasons!!"
94,1778,"Dec 4 2008 	Elevator problems but comfortable hotel overall	We stayed at the Midtown Comfort Inn from 11/29/08 to 12/2/08. Overall, the hotel is clean, comfortable and has a great location. There were two issues that came up during our stay....the elevator and the check-in process.  Our room was located on the 4th floor (there are a total of 9 floors) and the elevator was only functional part of the time. For us, this was not a major problem...since we are relatively fit and travel with carry-on size baggage. However, for guests with mobility issues or large luggage, this could be quite a problem..there are a lot of stairs and it is a narrow stairway.  Next, The check-in process was time consuming and rather involved. We arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm (knowing that check-in was at 3pm), and asked if it was possible to check-in or else be able to store our bags until we could check in. The man at the desk stated that our room was not ready, but that we could certainly store our luggage in a secure storage room, and that our room would be ready at 3pm. Not a problem. We stored our bags, proceeded to walk around Times Square, and returned to the hotel about 2:45 to get off our feet. Much to our surprise, the lobby was full...all the seats in the lobby were occupied with guests waiting to check-in and the only place to sit was in the adjoining breakfast room. Needless to say, we were told that our room was still not ready....along with all the other people waiting. We sat down and waited until 3pm. Precisely at 3pm, everyone lined up (at least a dozen people) and waited to go through the check-in process. The man who had been at the desk during our intial arrival was there, along with one other gentleman, apparently a reservationist that had just recently started his shift. The original reservationist started to help a guest and seemed totally incapable of helping her...she was apparently checking in using &quot;Rewards Points&quot; and he told the lady that she would have to come back later and see the other reservationist. This original reservationist then proceeded to go in the back room, get his jacket and was leaving because his shift was now over. The remaining reservationist did an admirable job of getting us checked in and was left to deal with all of the guests....by himself. It then became clear to everyone standing in line that the reason the original reservationist (who went off-duty) told everyone their room wasn't ready was because he didn't want to check them in...he wanted to leave it to the reservationist with the next shift. It appeared that he didn't want to do his job - or simply didn't know how. In any case, it was a poor representation for the Comfort Inn. I should point out that it was just this one original reservationist that seemed to do a poor job, he had no aptitude for customer service and genuinely seemed disinterested in the &quot;comfort&quot; of the hotel guests. I sincerely doubt that the rooms weren't ready, because the cleaning staff did an amazing job. They were very thorough and efficient. For example, we had left our room at one point around 10:30am and returned less than a half hour later to retrieve an additional guide book and the room had already been cleaned.  Due to the location, clean room, comfortable bed, and wireless internet access, we will likely give this hotel another chance. We travel frequently to the city and have stayed at a variety of locations. We have stayed at the Novotel and had very good experiences - they seem to have a higher level of service, with slightly higher prices. But, if the Comfort Inn Midtown is able to improve the staff (at least the one bad reservationist) and fix the elevator...then we will certainly be happy to stay there again."
95,1778,"Dec 3 2008 	Great Location with a good price	After much searching on Trip Advisor, decided on this one based on price, location and reviews. Although the room was small, it was fully renovated and everything brand new. Amazingly there was no noise, even though this is just 1 block from Times Sq. My room was located at the side-back with no view at all, but the quiet more than made up for that. The complimentary breakfast was adequate. Staff were friendly and helpful. Free internet was a much appreciated bonus! Recommend if prices still remain low, for NY standards. I know this review is a year late, but I am looking to return and thought I had already done a review."
96,1778,"Nov 29 2008 	Great Location!	This hotel is small and nondiscript from the street entrance. The doorman was very helpful, the lobby and rooms are small and clean. The breakfast buffet is limited but well taken care of by the friendly staff, so the area was neat and the food was fresh. There were problems with the heating system while I was there - the NY temp was in the 60's, the hotel heat was on and the AC in the room couldn't cool the temperature. The manager was accomodating and was able to give me a room on a higher floor which was a little cooler. The next day, the heat in the entire hotel was turned off, so it was much more comfortable. Overall, it suited my needs for a room to sleep at a reasonable price."
97,1778,"Nov 16 2008	Great place to stay	November 16, 2008Our hotel Comfort Inn Midtown Hotel was just off Time Square it was close to the subway. We had everything we needed and we spent most of our time looking at New York City. I would stay there again. The breakfast was a cold breakfast, they had hard boiled eggs you could warm in the microwave. Toast, rolls, cereal, banana's and other good things that were healthy. This opinion was written by a tripadvisor member."
98,1778,"Nov 16 2008 	Great deal for NYC!	My husband and I needed a relatively inexpensive hotel for one night in the city. It was perfect for us! Clean rooms, friendly staff, free continental breakfast. There was also a computer available for internet use and Wi-Fi access in the room. The room itself was a little small, but fine for one night. I think my only complaint is that you could not open the windows (there were signs on them saying not to open), so it was pretty stuffy. There was an air conditioner, but that didn't help the lack of fresh air. Overall, we plan on staying here again!"
99,1778,"Nov 4 2008	We ""lived""on Times Square!	I've just returned with my wife from a five night stay at the Comfort Inn, Midtown, Manhattan and it was a wonderful experience-helping in no small way to making our first trip to the Big Apple a most enjoyable occasion. In the past we've come back from a city break and reviewed our accomodation together and the consensus would always be it was OK but.......! But there were no &quot;buts&quot; about this hotel. It is literally yards from Times Square and the first comment we got from the taxi driver that brought us from JFK airport was that our hotel was in a very central location. It was spotlessly clean, the room was an adequate size, very comfortable bed, flat screen TV, extremely quiet considering we were so close to Times Square, the staff were warm, friendly and most helpful and welcoming, the buffet breakfast was substantial and really set us up for the days walking and exploring of this wonderful city. To sum up I would have no problem in recommending this hotel to anyone who wants to be right in the heart of the action and don't want to spend their time travelling in and out of the city. I was really delighted with my choice.Sean, Ireland."
100,1778,"Oct 29 2008 	Good Hotel - but be careful!	The comfort inn midtown is a good hotel, and worked well for our stay in July. The rooms are comfortable and well designed. The location, so long as you want to be slap-bang in the middle of the bright and flashy part of town, is excellent. (If quiet tree-lined avenues are more your thing, look elsewhere - this hotel is right off times square).Do bear in mind that this is a budget hotel meaning that the service is basic, the air conditioner is noisy and though the rooms are excellent, the rest of the hotel decor is a wee bit shabby. That's fine so long as you're happy with budget.One warning - when heading to the airport, the female receptionist may offer to arrange transport for you for $50. We accepted this offer, even though it was $5 more than a yellow cab. However, when we got to the Airport, we were charged $60. A real shame, as we didn't expect to be taken for a ride by the hotel staff. Politely decline and hail a cab instead."
101,1778,Oct 24 2008 	Great Place to stay	This was the best hotel I found while in New York. It's prices are comparably cheap; it's location is great and close to the metro and theater district; its rooms are great; it had complimentary breakfast and free baggage checking. I really appreciated all of these things when trying to stay in other hotels that were cheaper but a 1+ hour metro commute or that were not up to the same standards of rooms and service.
102,1778,"Oct 21 2008 	Loved Comfort Inn Midtown	Comfort Inn Midtown is a jewel! The exterior is deceiving. The lobby &amp; breakfast room are small but quite adequate. The staff at the hotel, especially a female reservation attendant, the bellman and the breakfast room attendant are all first-class. They were all so helpful during our stay. We appreciated the extra attention we received, especially since we were first time visitors to NYC. The room we had was small but beautifully decorated and very clean. Of course, we were only there to rest in the afternoon &amp; to sleep at night. We enjoyed being able to make free long distance phone calls to our family &amp; friends from our room. The choice of breakfast foods was exceptional, we were quite pleased. The location is wonderful-if you are able to walk, the theaters are close by, NBC studios, Times Square, we even walked back from the Empire State Bldg.!! We would definitely stay at Comfort Inn again if we go back to NYC. We thought the price was a bit much, however it is NYC!Steve &amp; BevRogersville, MO"
103,1778,"Oct 20 2008 	Great budget hotel very pleased	Excellent budget hotel, great location, friendly staff, small room (but you get what you pay for and in NY there is so much to do you don't spend much time in your room anyway!) Would def stay there again, its so close to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue etc, its ideal for a short break, ad the beds were very comfy too."
104,1778,"Oct 20 2008 	Excellent Value	There is nothing bad to say about this hotel. Great location - right at Times Square in the middle of everything. Friendly and helpful staff. Great breakfast every morning. Saved us lots of money. The room seemed to be recently re-done -- everything was clean and attractive - we even had a flat screen t.v. The room however was small - but typical for NYC. Bathroom also quite nice and clean. I can't complain about anything. Excellent value. You really don't need to stay in a big large and expensive hotel. They even have a little gym set up off the lobby, plus internet service in the lobby area. Totally an excellent hotel - just small. I would absolutely stay there again and again. Just be aware of one thing ... when we booked at the front desk our return transportation to Newark Airport .... they over-charged us about 6 dollars each on the shuttle. I guess that's how they make a couple of extra dollars for their service. We should have done it ourselves directly with Supershuttle. Supershuttle charges $19.00, and we paid the hotel $25.00 each. Oh well.. you live and learn."
105,1778,"Oct 12 2008 	Fantastic	Went to New York in July 2008, it was my first time in New York and I also got engaged. Everything about the trip was fantastic and this certainly included the hotel. It's the best possible location in Manhatten, very central for everything. The room we had was spotless, roomy and with very efficient air conditioning. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. And compared to the prices of New York hotels it was excellent value. As a bit of a stickler this is unusual for me to say but I really couldn't fault it and when I return to New York it's a no brainer where I'm going to stay!"
106,1778,"Oct 12 2008 	Location Location Location	We just stayed at this Hotel 10/10/08-10/11/08. We found it last minute (the night before our get away). We went into NYC to see a show for my daughter's 16th birthday (4 females, 2 adults, 2 children on this trip) and as it turned out it was just a hop, skip and jump away from our hotel. We felt very safe at this location. We were so pleasantly pleased with our stay here. Newly renovated hotel, when we walked into our room it was very clean!!! It was like brand new. The only thing I would complain about, was that they didn't offer conditioner with the shampoo, only lotion. Beds were so comfortable. The staff was very friendly and you are close to everything! There is also a continental breakfast offered here too (the area is a little small in that room, but to get a quick eat before you head out was great). There is a parking garage across the street that charges you $23 with validation from the hotel. My car was cared for, no problems at all and I was very nervous about that. We were also nervous about a lot of the hotel reviews that we checked out online, but this met our needs 100%. Really, how much time do you spend in the room anyhow? I recommend this hotel to everyone! I will definitely stay here again on our next overnight/vacation in the city. No need to be nervous, this is definitely a hotel to stay at for the price, we couldn't beat it. I also have to stress, LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION, it was awesome to be so close to everything. I would have included pictures but my camera wasn't working well. No need to hesitate on booking reservation here. Also, they have a luggage room you could keep your bags in if you have extended stay past the check out time."
107,1778,"Oct 8 2008 	Great spot... Highly recommend.....	arrived appx. 5:30pm by cab. Was greeted by doorman who brought our bags in from the street. EZ and friendly check in and bellman escorted us and baggage upstairs to our room. I had difficulty connecting to high speed internet ( very big deal to me), and went to the desk for help. Desk attendent was very helpful, gave me some literature to assist... I went back to the room and was able to connect. Good, strong signal. Nice size room with work desk and dresser with drawers.. My wife especially appreciated being able to use the drawers for storage space. Nice size Bathroom with tub/shower... VERY Hot water. Plenty of space to lay out shaving kit and all the wife's 'girl stuff ' . Nice plazma TV ( 36&quot; ? ) with cable. Good reception and working remote. ( another big deal to me ). We had trouble working the in-room coffee maker, called the desk and they brought us a new one. Good maid service throughout our stay even as late as 12noon when we slept in. One small elevator, but it seemed just fine... Never waited more than a few minutes. Had trouble getting internet to connect the last day, called the desk and attendant brought an ethernet cable, and I connected immediately. Asked the desk for a suggestion on pizza delivery, and they provided a flyer... The desk directed delivery man up to the room.. So happy, I shared a couple slices with nite desk clerk ( female)... I think she was shocked.. she offered to pay for the slices, and I told her I didn't want to waste and was happy to share. .. A little noisy on the street with garbage pickup, but surely not the hotel's fault.. Thick curtains kept out the unwanted sun in the morning.EZ check out and desk clerk made a call to get a car to the airport. Attendent took the bags out to the car. Ride cost about $10 more than the cab ride in, but very nice roomy SUV, friendly driver, took some short-cuts and we were there with loads of time to spare. Did not make it to the free breakfasts.Location was great, steps away to Times Square action, great Irish pub accross the street ( ate there twice ). Very attentive and friendly staff, as good of price as expected for the location... Very pleased.... Will definately stay at this location again"
108,1778,Sep 25 2008 	Location location location	Our first New York experience was made memorable by the attentive staff at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Jovanne was most accommodating when we checked in and was a welcome face on our 5-day stay. The room and general condition of the property was excellent and the morning breakfast was more than adequate to get you moving in the morning. Above all the location was fantastic. We would definitely stay there again.
109,1778,"Sep 25 2008 	Small but mighty!	My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at this hotel in September 2008. The staff was very friendly (especially Jovanni) and efficient. We paid about $250 a night - much better than most other hotels in the area. The room was very nicely decorated and clean. It is small. Our room had a queen size bed, night table, small desk and dresser with just enough room to walk around the bed. Window air conditioner was adequate for the time of year we were there. No view from our room. Small bathroom with shower only. Nice flat screen TV, clock radio with Ipod docking, free wifi internet and business centre, free US phone calls.Free breakfast was a plus. Fruit, coffee, cappucino, juice, yogurt, cereals, pastries, toast, boiled eggs. The breakfast room is small but we were always able to get a table.Hotel is one block from Times Square so location is excellent.If you go be sure to have a meal at Virgil's BBQ on 44th St. - terrific pulled pork sandwiches and fries! Also recommend doing &quot;Top of the Rock&quot; day and night time.As mentioned in a previous post the hotel gives guests the TripAdvisor web address so reviews can be posted. I have no problem with this. Other hotels should do the same."
110,1778,"Sep 25 2008 	Great hotel	This is a great hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the heart of New York as it is situated a couple of minutes walk from Time Square.Because the hotel is quite small, the staff were really friendly and the service better than most 5 star hotels I have stayed in.The rooms looked like they had been recently refurbished and were clean and well maintained and continental breakfast was included in the rate. This really is a great base to explore New York for a few days."
111,1778,"Sep 16 2008 	A gem of a hotel	Have just stayed at this hotel with 3 friends. We had two rooms, both of which were very clean, quiet, recently decorated and very comfortable. As expected in New York, room sizes are not huge but they are perfectly adequate and have all the facilities you may want. Location is superb - we walked most of the time during the day and had no trouble hailing taxis outside at night. Buffet breakfast is plentiful, and sets you up for a good day shopping, sight seeing etc. The best thing of all however is the staff - they could not do enough to help and earned their tips many times over. Would definitely go back and would highly recommend to others."
112,1778,Sep 9 2008	Love the Comfort Inn	The hotel staff was great...Everyone was pleasant and always willing to help. The breakfast was great too! The rooms were clean and just the right size for two people. The location was the best--- in the middle of Times Square. I would certainly stay there again whenever I visit New York City.-Laurie
113,1778,"Sep 2 2008	Small Rooms but good value	Currently staying there and thought I would write a quick review.Location - Superb its just off 46th and 7th next to Rosie o Gradys so nice and close to all the actionValue - $230 a night so goodRooms - TINY but clean and shower is fine. You will be hard pushed to swing a cat but hey your not in NY to do that. Beds nice and comfyNoise Level - Superb, Its on 46th so not a main road hence the normal NY dinn doesnt come in the &quot;tiny&quot; windows"
114,1778,"Sep 1 2008 	Good For The Price	Chose this hotel after reading the other reviews, and found them to be pretty accurate. As for a review that claimed it was good for singles, I would have to disagree. My husband and I both stayed in a queen size room and found it to be quite adequate. We did not have a problem with space and were able to move around freely. We requested a room with a view other than the brick wall posted in other reviews, at check-in were pleased to see that our request was granted! Staff were friendly and accommodating.It was also nice to have the continental breakfast available, this is not common in NYC.Again, our room was spacious (by NYC standards), updated, and clean. We also did not have any issues with the elevator as some of the other quests have mentioned.The only negative that we had was the window air conditioner, it did have a bad odor to it, maybe it is time to clean the filters!Would recommend this hotel to anyone that needs a reasonably priced clean room!"
115,1778,"Sep 1 2008 	Fantastic Service	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently. The service from the staff was exceptional! We checked out on the day of a major festival which closed off the street in front of the hotel and for many surrounding streets as well. We needed a cab to the airport but none could reach the hotel. The manager on duty - Giovanni - made some calls, arranged a ride for us and then the bellman transported our luggage through the crowds (several thousands of people) to Broadway which was nearby and got us in our ride. This was exceptional service which only capped a completely enjoyable stay at this hotel. We will not hesitate to stay here gain."
116,1778,"Aug 31 2008	Another Happy Camper	I was also just there as a solo from August 25-29. I got extremely lucky (I think I may have gotten the last room available when I checked in), but even though I was a solo they gave me a room with 2 double beds - which the bellman said was one of the &quot;big&quot; rooms. This greatly added to my personal space to have the extra bed to pile my stuff, but the room was still a very tight squeeze - the foot of the bed is so close to the tv desk that you have to scoot sideways to get by. I'm sure the double room I reserved would have been unbelievably small.I had also requested a quiet room, and the room overlooked the back alley and the backs of other buildings. I heard almost no street noise. The only noise was some bells that clanged every morning at 7:30 am, which to me was the perfect time to get up anyway (I think they were from the church next door).That said, my experience was fantastic. The staff is great - everyone greets you with a smile and hello, answers any questions, is very helpful. The whole place is very clean. Breakfast is adequate. And the location is beyond compare - half a block to Times Square in one direction, close to several different subway lines. I felt safe at all times.Now, some people I think have been disappointed because they see all these 5 star ratings so they think it is a 5 star hotel - it is not - but it IS a 5 star VALUE...the 5 stars here on TA come from answering the question &quot;Rate your overall experience&quot; - and to most of us, it was 5 star. I will also post one of the few negatives here - my a/c unit was very noisy, so I couldn't run it all the time. I would turn it on for a short period, it cooled off the room quickly, and then I would shut it off. It might be a problem if the weather is very hot for your entire stay, for me it was not. And one great positive that I didn't expect and didn't know about until I checked in - free US phone calls! Anywhere! I called my husband and daughter on the west coast several times a day, made and cancelled many local reservations, and was charged not one cent for telephone charges! What a great bonus that was!Someone a few posts down said they were asked to write a good review on TA, and therefore the ratings are skewed. NO ONE asked me make mention of the hotel to anyone, this review is written purely based on my personal experience.I know this hotel can be more expensive at different times of the year (I was lucky and got a $197 AAA rate in August), but New York is a very expensive hotel city. I was completely happy with my stay."
117,1778,"Aug 30 2008 	Right on Times Square!	My wife and I stayed 6 nights at this hotel and we chose it for the price and location. Accommodation in New York is generally expensive, but we thought that this hotel was well priced and it's location is great being right on Times Square and Broadway.The room we had was a bit small, but adeqaute. The bed was comfortable and there was a new 40&quot; LCD TV in the room. The hotel provides free wireless and networked internet access which was very handy. One thing that bugged us though with the room was the airconditioner was a bit noisy and our room had a view of the wall of the building next door which was about 2 metres away.Staff were helpful and the breakfast that is served in the moring is really quite good with a selection of cerials, bagels, fruit, yoghurt, toast, juice and coffee.If visiting NYC again, we would definitley stay there again."
118,1778,"Aug 25 2008 	Excellent hotel for Single Traveler!!!	I was very impressed with this hotel. The location on W46th at Broadway was an amazing location to everything in midtown. The beds were clean and comfortable, with an Ipod docking station and flat screen TV. The room, however, is small and may cause challenges for two people in the room. But for one person, I loved the compactness of the room. No tub in the bathroom, only a shower. Nice size closet, but had to pull the curtains out of the way to open the door. Like I said, compact, but sufficient. Good breakfast room with cereal, fruit and yogurt, bagels which is great with me. The staff was friendly and helpful and seemed really concerned about my needs. I would definitely stay here again if traveling alone to NYC again."
119,1778,"Aug 19 2008	Wonderful :)	I just recently stayed with my mom at the hotel for a few days and we had a very plesant stay. The hotel rooms were extremly clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was very clean as well and the shower was not one of those overpowering showers that hurt when they blast the water. Anything you need or any questions you have can be answered by the friendly staff (especially Ivonne!). There is a great breakfast every morning with: bagels, doughnuts, cereal, yougurt, etc. and coffe and tea are available all day long. The location is perfect everything is just a step out the door!"
120,1778,Aug 16 2008 	Great location and price!	My wife and I stayed 2 nights to attend a Broadway play on each night. Hotel was very clean and staff was courteous and helpful. Room was small but comfortable and quiet. The location was excellent for those who like to sightsee. Times Square at one end of the block and Madison Avenue on the other. There is an excellent little deli to the right as you exit the hotel. Majority of what we came to see was within walking distance. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a room at a reasonable price convenient to Broadway and attractions.
121,1778,Aug 10 2008 	Great hotel and Location	My husband had a business trip in NY and my 10 year old daughter and I tagged along. We were sight seeing most of the days by ourselves and the location of this hotel could not have been better! The staff was very helpful and the hotel room was quiet. We never felt uncomfortable in any way and were very close to the shows we went to see. We would definitely stay there again!
122,1778,"Aug 9 2008 	highly recommended!	We visited NYC for the first time in July, 2008, and knew we wanted to stay in Times Square. We researched many, many hotels to find something nice but for a nice price also as hotels are very expensive. The Comfort Inn Midtown received great reviews not only from TripAdvisor.com but also from other travel websites and the rate was great- $202, which was actually the cheapest for a Times Square hotel so we decided to give it a try. We LOVED it and would highly recommend it to others. The hotel location was perfect; when you leave the hotel you turn right and after walking not even 1/2 a block you're in Times Square. It's also very close to subway stations and you're within walking distance to all of the theaters. The hotel was very clean and looked great- they've done some recent upgrades and decorating. We were concerned that the room would be very small but it was just fine. Housekeeping was great also. One of the biggest perks was the free continental breakfast b/c food in NYC is very expensive and my husband can eat a lot! Another perk was there were 2 computers with a printer to use on the main floor so on the night before our departure we were able to log in to our airline to check in and print our boarding passes for free for our flight home. We had no complaints throughout our 4 night stay. We loved NYC and can't wait to visit again and when we do we'll stay here again."
123,1778,"Aug 7 2008 	Excellent hotel for the money	After reading several reviews we picked this hotel. We didn't want to spend a fortune since we wouldn't be in the hotel a lot, but we wanted a hotel close to Times Square. We just returned from New York today, and I felt I needed to write a review to add to the already positive comments. I would definitely stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown again. It is only a block off of Times Square. It was very clean and updated. It has a daily continental breakfast. It is much cheaper than the other hotels in the area. The staff is very friendly and attentive.The rooms are small, but we spent very little time in the room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
124,1778,Aug 6 2008	Liked It	Very nice hotel and close to Times Square. Some walking distance to Penn Station though I would stay at this place again.
125,1778,"Aug 6 2008 	Convenient to Theatres and Times Square But...	My teenage daughter and I enjoyed our stay in New York but probably would not stay here again. If you want to save money and want to be close to the theatres and crowds at Times Square and only need a place to sleep and eat breakfast then consider this hotel. The room was nicely decorated and reasonably clean with the exception of the windows. Absolutely filthy on the outside. I guess with all the pigeons there must not seem much point? There wasn't much to see but still not very nice. Plumbing upstairs makes noise which was tolerable when we were awake but at 4:46am was a bit much. Since the rooms are quite small you sleep near the door and can hear people talking in the hallways. Light sleepers should run the a/c as it helps mask the other sounds. Staff were generally polite; however, one desk clerk wasn't very friendly and when a street person (several sleep next door at the church) followed me in asking for $ he didn't even ask him to leave! Continental breakfast was pretty good and we never had to wait long for a seat. Don't bother taking the elevator down unless you absolutely have to; usually much faster to walk, even from the ninth floor. Two free computers in the lobby were a bonus."
126,1778,"Aug 5 2008	Loved Comfort Inn Midtown	Loved Comfort Inn - Midtown!!My husband and I just returned from New York City for our first visit there. After much research on TripAdvisor and recommendations from co-workers I decided to reserve here. Everyone is correct in what they write. The front staff and doorman are are very helpful, courteous. We arrived at 8:00 a.m. and they were kind enough to let us change and store our luggage until our room was available. They even invited us to go into the continental breakfast room!!! The food in this room is great and the man in charge is so helpful and friendly. Our room was just the right size, the bathroom perfect for a couple and a flatscreen TV - but hey - how long do you stay in your room when in NYC! The room was very very clean. One day we had a problem with the air conditioner and a very nice Polish man came up and fixed it during the day - he even popped by around 5:00 before he left for the day to make sure it was working! I could not believe how close we were to Times Square and Broadway!!! Night and day everything was within walking distance. If I ever went back to New York again I would definitely stay here."
127,1778,"Aug 4 2008 	Very nice accomodations great value great location..	It's hard to find a pleasant hotel in NYC for a reasonable price - this Comfort Inn fits the bill. It is recently remodeled /redecorated. The rooms are tiny (but normal size by NYC standards) but beautiful, the location is a very safe area a block from Times Square. Like the rest of the Choice Hotels chain, this is a hotel managed for frequent travellers - you won't find bellhops, mini-bars, or room service - just fast checkin/checkout, a really clean, comfortable room at a great price, fast, free wireless.(Book through the hotel web site in advance, use AARP or AAA for best prices...) I dont' think you'll find a better value anywhere in that area."
128,1778,"Aug 4 2008 	Excellent value	We stayed here for 6 nights on our first trip to New York and really enjoyed it. The hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly. We were upgraded to a King room on arrival and although space was limited the room had everything we needed including a large flat screen TV. One oddity with the room was that we stayed here in January so it was obviously very cold outside, however our room was always very hot - meaning we needed the air conditioner on everytime we were in it.The free breakfast at the hotel was a plus and included bagels, doughnuts and cereals. The location is probably the best thing about this hotel as it is about 100 metres from Time Square and convenient for most of the big attractions. I also liked that we were able to walk here from Penn Station after getting the train from Newark airport. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel as it offered excellent value for money in a great location."
129,1778,"Jul 27 2008 	Great Hotel Value	Our first trip to New York and this hotel was great. Great location in Times Square and Broadway, but was very quiet. The staff was very friendly and helpfull and the price much less than other hotels. We highly recomend this hotel."
130,1778,"Jul 20 2008 	great place to stay!!5 stars	we just got back from NY jul 20 2008. This place was great. Right when we arrived Amir took our bags and showed me the parking garage across the street. He took my wife and our stuff upstairs and got us settled. The desk staff were helpfull about telling us where to go and get thngs. Anthoni in the breakfast room keeps things clean and tidy as well as keeping all the food filled up. As soon as someone is leaving he is right there cleaning the table for the next person. breakfast had juices, cereals, bagels,toast, yogurt, coffee. everything you need to start your day. the location was about 100 meters from Times Square so you could wander down there in 2 minutes to see it every night. Basically i would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to everyone.. great place to stay.jdmississauga, ontario"
131,1778,"Jul 18 2008 	not the greatest place	First of all, I would warn fellow travelers to take the reviews with a grain of salt, since guests at this hotel are requested to submit favorable reviews of the hotel to tripadvisor. (The hotel hands out hotel info sheets and the suggestion to submit a favorable review to trip advisor is included on the sheet.) So I feel there really is some bias here. If you JUST want a place to sleep for the night, this place fits the bill fine, but I found there were a lot of little things that bothered me. First, the room was tiny. Just enough room to walk around the bed and the desk. The bathroom was small too (had a shower stall, but no tub), but manageable for one person. The window faced a brick wall (literally a few inches away) and therefore got virtually no natural sunlight in the morning. Made it hard to wake up! The hallways outside the rooms were very narrow. There was an air conditioner in the room, and it went as cold as 64 degrees, but that was barely cold enough. It would have been nice to get it colder when I was working out. They provide shampoo, but not conditioner. Again, not a huge deal (it's easy enough to stop by Duane Reed), but when you realize this in the morning when getting up, it's not great."
132,1778,"Jul 9 2008 	LOVE staying at the Comfort Inn Midtown 129 West 46th Street (off Broadway)	We happened to pick the Comfort Inn Midtown, 129 West 46th St. last October 2007 and were so happy with it, that we stayed there again over the Independence Day holiday 2008. They have continued to upgrade their hotel (which already looked excellent in October). It's close to the theatre-district for theatre-goers (just off of Rockefeller Plaza). It's got a 24 business and fitness center: wireless internet access, exercise room, ability to print Boarding Pass for business travelers and anyone. All the rooms have plasma TV. Free and delicious breakfast with an excellent variety of food and beverages. The room was perfect. The service was excellent, efficient, friendly, and everyone went out of their way to be helpful. The price was right (with a 10% discount if you show your AAA or AARP card upon arrival). Air-conditioning/heat can be adjusted. Whenever we go to NY, we LOVE to stay at this hotel. It's close to everything. At our last stay in July, we surprised at the many improvements to what we considered to be an already great hotel. It was one of the first smoke-free hotels in NY. It's along Restaurant Row. The already helpful and courteous staff was very good about holding our luggage until we had to go to Newark. The gentleman at the desk showed us how to print our Boarding Pass the night we were leaving - and got a very helpful driver to take us to Newark that night. He, and all the staff, were very kind and helpful, as always. There's no charge for New York state calls &amp; toll-free calls. Each room has coffee makers with coffee &amp; tea, an alarm clock radio that's MP3 compatible, and a reduced rate parking. Complimentary continental breakfast (with microwave) is from 7am-10am with plenty of tasty food (best granola we've ever eaten). Besides the usual phone with voicemail and hair dryers, it has computers/copiers/fax machines 24 hrs/day, cable with movies on demand. The rooms are very pleasant-looking, comfortable, and you don't hear any noise down the hall or next door. We consider this to be a first rate hotel and have recommended it to everyone going to NY. It's part of the Apple Core Hotels, so if you don't want to be off of the Theatre district, they have other locations, too. It was GREAT! We wholeheartedly and enthusiastically recommend it."
133,1778,"Jul 7 2008 	What more is there to say!!!	I am not sure what I can say that has not already been said! You just can not imagine the feeling I had, coming into New York City after being in the air and airports for over 12 hours, on a dark rainy night for the first time. Planning a 7 day stay, with reservations at a place with a rate almost too good to be true, I just had a sinking feeling.I was so pleased when the gentleman at the front desk was so helpful, and then the bell man who took our bags to our room was equally as pleasant. (By then it was midnight, and we were 4 hours late.) I just held my breath when he opened the door to our room, I was really expecting the worst, and telling myself to be satisfied as long as there are no bugs!And then! The room was small as noted in some of the previous reviews, but we had everything we needed in just the right place. And to top it off the room had been completely re-done from the shower to the very comfortable bed, and had what appeared to be new linens, carpet, paint, even a flat screen television.I felt the breakfast was more than adequate, and the gentleman in charge there was equally as pleasant. Each morning was a selection of cereals, fruits, donuts, bagels, toast, yogurts, juices, coffee, and even Cappuccino.Our room was cleaned everyday whatever time we seemed to get back to our room, almost like someone was watching us leave and then got right down to the business of getting it ready for our next night.The location could not have been better as we realized the first morning when we started to find our way around. It is close to everything from Times Square to Rockefeller Center, We even walked to Central Park and the Empire State Building.And, I also think there is something to be said about management who cares enough to watch the comments on TripAdvisor, and reply to any problems there may have been during a stay. I just hope we are able to visit this hotel again in the near future, and find it the way it was on our first trip. With the caring attitude we saw, I really think we will. Now the rate, that may be another issue!"
134,1778,"Jun 25 2008 	Excellent Value!	We've just spent four nights in the Comfort Inn Midtown. We chose this location based on the favorable reviews in TripAdvisor; we were not disappointed. We found the hotel to be an excellent location - one block to Times Square, two blocks to Rockefeller Center, easy walking distance to the subway and theaters. The hotel is on a semi-quiet street just off of of Time Square. Our room included a very comfortable king sized bed and a flat screen TV; the room was smallish but how much time do you spend in your room? The bathroom was nice sized. We enjoyed the complmentary breakfast (cereals, fruits, juices, rolls); the breakfast room was cramped but ,hey, its a free meal! We've read that the one elevator was slow - that seems to be true; we had a room on the 2nd floor and just used the stairs. The hotel does not have a concierge, so, bring your own maps and visitors information. The desk staff did arrange a town car for transportation to Newark Airport. We were very satisfied with our stay and will use the hotel again."
135,1778,"Jun 24 2008	Just how tripadvisor reviewers said	Great location; extremely convenient near Times Square; rooms where cozy, clean, and pretty nice for NYC. The staff was professional. The breakfast food was no better; no worse then you'd find anywhere in the US. There was some street noise but I guess that comes with the territory. Subway was close. So long as they don't up their rates; this is the good deal. I would definitely stay there again."
136,1778,"Jun 22 2008 	Small Clean Non Nonsense hotel	Booked via [--] - they appeared to have the best Internet rates. Availability and prices changes regularly on their website so check in regularly.Room was smaller than I expected - just enough to lay 2 medium size suitacase on the floor next to TV and still walk around the bed single file - bit was clean. Free continental breakfast in smaller room and wireless Internet provided. We were a bit spoilt having stayed at much bigger and luxurious Grand Hyatt and Westin Times Square the previous 7 nights - however, if you want somewhere to sleep and save monies for shopping, then Comfort Inn Midtown provides clean and safe option.Location was good in &quot;Little Brazil&quot; street (46th) just off Broadway and in quiet street."
137,1778,"Jun 21 2008	100% Satisfied	We just returned from a 5 day stay in NYC and this hotel was the best! We couldn't think of anything we'd change except maybe a little larger elevator. Room was plenty big enough, clean, updated, and quiet. The staff was excellent and friendly. If you are looking for anything more, then you had better be willing to pay more. The location was perfect for our needs. If and when we return we will for sure stay there."
138,1778,"Jun 16 2008 	Love this place!	My husband and I recenty stayed here for the 2nd time and I really feel like we've found our NY &quot;home away from home&quot;. Our room was spotless and you can tell had been updated recently, with a nice flat screen tv. There was enough room and it was quiet. We used the safe in the room and we also enjoy the continental breakfast with cereal, pasteries, fruit, coffee, tea,, juice, yogurt, etc. Also, the location cannot be beat! Everyone at the desk was helpful. We just really feel at home here and love that it is so clean, good location and breakfast.The price cannot be beat in Manhattan!"
139,1778,"Jun 10 2008 	Better than I expected	I stayed at this hotel in April 2008 and I really liked it. Of course the location is fabulous. It's a block from Times Square and around the corner from Rockefeller Square. If you don't know your way around the city, the location of the hotel makes it easy to see some of the biggest tour attractions without having to figure out the subway system. I don't know if it was just because it was in NYC, but it was a lot fancier than any Comfort Inn I'd ever stayed in. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They literally carried in our bags the moment we stepped out of the cab and the desk clerk even allowed us to check in 4 hours early. The room was clean and not as small as I expected after reading some reviews here on Trip Advisor. I shared a room with a girlfriend and we were both able to move around comfortably. The bed was large and comfortable. I only had two complaints and I wouldn't even call them complaints. There is only one elevator and it's really slow. Also, the room we were in had a weird bathroom door. The middle of the bathroom door was frosted glass so whenever one of us had to use the bathroom, the other person would have to move to the other side of the room to give them some privacy. Those are minor issues, though and didn't affect my stay or feelings about the hotel. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and will be staying at this hotel again when I return to NYC in August."
140,1778,Jun 9 2008 	Great value/location	Excellent value for the money. Relatively (!) quiet street very near Times Square. Helpful staff and pleasant and nicely sized room. Much nicer than your average Comfort Inn.
141,1778,"Jun 5 2008 	Would recommemd to anyone	Stayed at The Comfort Inn Midtown over Memorial Day weekend. As it was our first visit to NYC we didnt really know to expect. I must say we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. We arrived well before the 3:00 pm check in time expecting to have to wait to check in, but our room was ready and they let us in. The staff was friendly and helpful, everything was new and modern, tastefully decorated, comfortable bed, nice sized dresser and closet (with a safe), flat screen TV, plus numerous other &quot;little things&quot; that made it very comfortable. The rooms are cozy , we used the dresser for our clothes and tucked our suitcases away in a corner leaving plenty of room for 2 people. The wall mounted A/C worked good we just ran it all day so when we returned at night the room was nice a cool and it stayed that way all night.Only 1 elevator that can be a little slow, but we were on the 3rd floor so we used the stairs most of time anyway.The location is awesome, turn right out of the entrance and Times Square is about a 100 yard walk.Just a great place all around, with great rates to go along with it!!"
142,1778,"Jun 4 2008 	Perfect location great hotel great service great price	Simply put, I was looking for a cheap hotel in NYC which was affordable and got a WHOLE lot more.I only had 2 nights to spend in mid town Manhattan and did a lot of researching on the web for somewhere cheap but good. This place was GREAT.The location was perfect being only 100 metres or so from times square. It was a really easy walk to most Broadway theatres. I was able to walk to Central Park (although it is a 30+ minute walk).Since times square was always busy I never really felt I was walking in a quiet strange part of NY alone even though I was by myself.The hotel is better than nice. Very well appointed rooms with LCD TVs, clean bathrooms and very good wireless and wired internet access (with 1.5 Mbps up AND down speeds for those of you technically minded).The room was small but I was only in my room to sleep.The service at the front desk was suburb (especially Jiovanni).There is a small place called cafe @ times square a couple of doors down and it is a great place to grab some food for at a reasonable price ($4 for a burger and fries compared with TGI Fridays which was charging $17+ for the same thing a couple of doors down).This part of 46th St is also known as little Brazil and there are a few South American inspired restaurants on the street.My only complaint was that the air-conditioning was at the same level as the bed. When I turned it on it was continually blowing directly on my face. If I turned it off the room got too warm.So I highly recommend it to anyone looking a clean and safe place to stay while in NYC.I will definitely stay there again if I find myself fortunate enough to be in town again."
143,1778,"Jun 2 2008 	Fabulous Midtown Experience	This is my 2nd year staying at this hotel. The renovations are complete and the hotel and staff are marvelous. We are so not from NYC, but love the atmosphere and this hotel really caters to our needs for directions, customer service, and a relaxful stay. I cant wait to return next year. The basic amenities that come with the room like free interent, gym, and continential breakfast also are key reasons why I continue to book this hotel when I go to NYC. I highly recommend this hotel."
144,1778,"May 30 2008 	Loved it!	Excellent hotel - room was modern, comfortable and absolutely spotless. The location is excellent, literally 30 seconds from Time Square and I found the staff helpful and friendly at all times.The room was a decent size and was plenty enough space for 2 people. Free and fast wireless connection with a business center on the ground floor which you could use for printing. Very good attention to detail :) I would have no hesitation in returning or recommending. Thanks!"
145,1778,"May 27 2008 	Great Place Great Price!	I did a lot of research before booking our hotel, both on AAA and Trip Advisor. I cannot say enough about this hotel!We paid just over $200 a night. I would suggest you book as far in advance as possible because one lady we met at breakfast paid $300 a night for the same room! The front desk was very friendly and helpful. When they found out we were on our honeymoon, they upgraded us to a king-size room at no additional charge! They gave us a great map of the city and offered to give advice on restaurants, places to see, etc... We took them up on their offer and went to a delicious little coffee/sandwhich shop a block away.The room was extremely clean, the bed and pillows were nice and soft (not like the cardboard beds I've slept on in some hotels), and you could tell it had been remodeled recently. We just had one bag, but there wasn't a lot of extra room to spread it out and have the ironing board set up. It wasn't a big deal because we really weren't in the room that much. The breakfast had a great selection - from bagels and cream cheese, to donuts and cappucino, to granola and yogurt. They also have a small area with two computers and free internet, so we were able to check into our flight online before going to the airport.The location could not have been more perfect or centrally located. We were able to walk nearly everywhere, Central Park, Greenwich Village, and Madison Square Park to name a few. The best part was that we were only one block away from the theater where we went to see a Broadway play.If we ever return to NYC (and I'm sure we will!), we will definitely stay here again."
146,1778,"May 27 2008 	Great location! Very close to Times Square.	This hotel is in an EXCELLENT location. Just around the corner from Times Square. The street is more on the quiet side later in the evening, not many cars, if any, that came through. Across the street is an Irish Pub, next door is a church, and down the street towards Broadway is a Brazilian restaurant. There were also a couple of souvenir shops a few doors down, also towards Broadway. The hotel was clean, the hotel staff were friendly, the Continental breakfast was ok. We were surprised that there was a tip basket though. We've never had to tip for Continental breakfasts before. The free internet was great although at times we had to wait to use the internet as there was only two computers. There is also a fitness room, which looked nice, but we never used it. Complimentary newspapers were put out in the morning. The elevator does go all the way up to the 9th floor despite another guest reviewer that stated it only went up to the 8th floor. Our room was extremely small, but if you don't mind getting a little cozy with your loved one then its no problem! The bed was really comfortable and there was also a large flat screen TV in the room. The only negative things I would say was that the room was BOILING hot. The heater was never on but somehow the room was BOILING hot all the time. It appeared that in the walls was where the heat was coming from. When we touched the bathroom wall it was very warm. At night we would have to turn the a/c on even if it was cold outside so that we would be able to sleep comfortably. Another negative thing was that the phone, only worked by pushing the speaker button. Apparently it was a new phone and the hotel staff did not know how it worked through the hand set.Despite all this, the hotel was well worth the stay and we will definitely be staying here again should we ever come back to New York City."
147,1778,"May 26 2008 	Better than expected	6 of us were here from the UK for 4 nights in May 2008. 2 of us had stayed at the hotel about 3 years ago. Have tried since then to get a room for other visits, but it was always fully booked. No wonder - hotel has since been refurbished and is better than ever. Rooms and facilities were great and you cannot fault the location. Same staff from our last visit and they are as friendly as ever and the breakfast is very good. Would like write a poor review, as I may not be able to get a room for future visits, but that wouldn't be fair as the staff/hotel definitely deserve all the good words said about them!!!"
148,1778,"May 23 2008 	Hundreds of Hotels in NYC....this is the one you want!	There are literally hundreds and hundreds of hotel options to choose from in NYC. Different star ratings, different locations, different customer service and very different pricing. So how does the Comfort Inn rate in these categories? Absolutely superb in all of them. My wife and I recently stayed 5 x nights and apon check-in were told that we had been upgraded to a king size just renovated room....sweet! Ipod docking, flat screen, good size bathroom with strong hot running water, free wireless (very fast), desk, wardrobe and a humongous king size bed. Luggage space was perhaps a little bit tight, but not a problem. Decent views. It was 802 if anyone wants to reserve it. The location is excellent...down a reasonably quiet street just seconds away from the utter madness of Times Square. There are plenty of restaurants on the street such as Chinese, Italian and a great deli so no probs for quick food options. Many of the main attractions are accessible by foot. Some can take up to 30/40 mins walking, but because theres so much going on around you, you dont even realise you've walked for that long. The underground is easy to use and takes you everywhere. The staff must be commended for there customer service, friendliness and professionalism. From front desk, housekeeping and the porters, all the staff made us feel welcome at all times, something that is most welcomed from big days out touring the city. For a small hotel, with good service, good values and good prices, this is an absolute winner for New York City.We toured at least 8 hours a day checking out the sights, and feel we barley touched the sides of NYC! A big shout out for Sidibi the bellman, Anthony the breakfast guy and Ivonne the receptionist."
149,1778,"May 21 2008 	Great Boutique Hotel	Two of us spent one week at the hotel, 1/2 a block from Times Square and the Theatre district. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was small but adequate, clean and met our needs. We booked ahead online and got great rates. This hotel has everything one needs - and is small and cozy. Free email, hot showers, breakfast, good advice and directions. We will try to use this as our Hotel in NewYork in the future. It's location is perfect! Well done! Thankyou for a good experience."
150,1778,"May 20 2008 	Believe All the Great Reviews	I was a late addition to a multi-party trip to NYC, and the private hotel where everyone else was staying was booked. So I went on google and searched for hotels nearby and then hit TripAdvisor for the reviews. Comfort Inn Midtown was the only hotel I could not find a single bad review for. Even among the $600+ per night hotels, they all had at least one or two recent bad reviews. Not Comfort Inn Midtown. So I rolled the dice. This was my first trip to NYC, and I was more than a little nervous. I could not have been more pleased. The room was fantastic. Had PLENTY OF SPACE! Hot water for every shower. Almost no noise from the street. No sounds from other rooms. The continental b'fast in the morning is great. Free business center where I was able to make copies of a white paper for meetings and print my boarding passses for return trip home (all FREE). The front desk arranged a $25 shuttle to return to the airport (It cost me $60 to get into town from the airport (Laguardia) WITHOUT the asst. of the hotel.) The hotel is at 6th Ave. and 46th. This is 2 quick blocks from Times Square and a half block from the (summer) Saturday street vendor fair on 6th Ave. It was just a few walking blocks from 30 Rockefeller Plaza (think NBC). Great little English pub across the street. Walking distance to MOMA and Bryant Park and so much more!Very safe, very clean, professional courteous staff. I can't say enough, except I will definitely go back to this hotel. If I had to reach for a negative, I would say that from around 8:30 a.m. to noon, the FREE wireless internet in the room had spotty reception. Other than that, I can't think of a single complaint. Book this hotel! You won't regret it."
151,1778,"May 20 2008 	Location location ...	We spent 5 nights at this hotel from 10-15 May 2008. Excellent location - hotel is small, comfortable (brilliant bed), well refurbished bedroom and bathroom (good shower), very clean, staff friendly, approachable and helpful (especialy Sandip on Reception). Continental breakfast very good (cereals, fruit, yoghurt, juices, tea, coffees, toast, waffles, pastries and gorgeous iced doughnuts!) included in booking. Theatres are a few minutes' walk away, as is ticket booth for shows (half price tickets), Times Sq a minute away yet street is quite quiet. Macys, Rockerfella Centre, 5th Ave all within walking distance. We would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel."
152,1778,May 16 2008 	Loved the Comfort Inn	We were very happy with our stay at the Comfort Inn. The people were very friendly. The room was small but very clean and comfortable. The hotel is located close to the theater district. A great location. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone that is coming to NYC. We will definitely stay here again.
153,1778,"May 12 2008 	Definitely will go back	Went to the city with 2 other couples for a Broadway show. Arrived a the hotel before check-in, but rooms were ready for us. Daytime desk clerk extremely accommodating, friendly &amp; very helpful (night-time clerk quite the opposite). Rooms were extremely clean, comfortable beds, looks recently renovated. You absolutely cannot beat the location - easy access anything you need (food, transportation, shopping, theater). Will definitely be staying there again!"
154,1778,"Apr 28 2008 	Fantastic Hotel Great Location 	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in April. It was a fantastic stay!The rooms are small, but certainly big enough for 2 with cozy bedding and a modern clean bathroom.Our room faced the street and there was some noise as well as that of water running from above when folks were showering.The staff were friendly and knowledgeable although they could have used more than 1 person at check in time on the front desk.The breakfast was more than adequate. The hotel and the rooms were very clean and the location is unbeatable for the price.Would definitely stay again."
155,1778,"Apr 25 2008 	Incredible Location: 30 Yards From Times Square	WONDERFUL LOCATION. Great Price, literally you are about 30 yards down the street from all of the hustle and bustle of Times Square.Very close to all of the places that you want to see and go to in downtown New York City.The room is small, but so is every other room in New York. Why pay hundreds more for a room that you are not going to be in.The room is small, bed, nightstand, TV cabinet, bathroom. That is about it, but what else do you need.We were not in our room we were out in the city, we would leave early in the morning and come in late at night.The hotel did have a very nice continental breakfast, and as everything is expensive in NYC, it was nice to not have to pay for breakfast.Next trip back to NYC, we will stay here again!"
156,1778,"Apr 23 2008 	Applecore (owner) Made a Believer	I searched the internet for several hours. The reviews for this hotel were very good and the price was competitive, so I crossed my fingers and made reservations.First, the location could not be better. We were a half block from Times Square, 2 1/2 blocks from our theater (Phantom of the Opera), and in the middle of all the places we wanted to go. When we arrived we found the desk personnel very pleasant, but even more importantly competent, professional and helpful. The lobby is small but quite adequate and clean.Upon entering our room, king-size bed, we were further pleased. While the room was small it was very functionally laid out. The decor from bedspread to paint on the walls was pleasant. Flat screen TV. Great shower with lots of hot water. Very importantly, everything was clean, clean, clean.We used the two computers and printer just off the lobby for which there was no charge. The breakfast was included and was more than adequate and the service personnel were again helpful and pleasant.etc, etc, etc. . . we would go back again!"
157,1778,"Apr 9 2008 	Small cozy convenient	I've stayed at this hotel three times already while visiting NYC on short trips. I've always booked online and never paid more than $80 a night. For the price and the location, I will continue to stay there!LOCATION: Literally in Times Square! Restaurants surround the hotel - chain and otherwise. It's not a very picturesque street, it's crowded with tourists during the day, what with the proximity of Times Square, but it is sooo convenient to the subway, eating, tourist attractions and shopping!THE HOTEL: Is clean and very small. The staff has always been helpful - not always 'warm', but for sure always helpful. The business center is a closet with two desktop computers - but serves it's purpose if you're just using it to check in for your flight and printing off your boarding passes. The work out room is larger and has your basic equipment. It may be small, but it is a nice amenity for this hotel. I never tried the continental breakfast, so I don't have an opinion on it.THE ROOM: The rooms that I have stayed in never had windows overlooking the street, but rather, the space between buildings - lol. Needless to say, the curtains were always drawn. The rooms themselves have been small, but surprisingly, the bathrooms have been roomier. The rooms have always been clean. And I have always stayed at this hotel alone - and still felt safe. The room size, in my opinion, would be okay for two people, but forget about anymore than that. Also, since space was an issue, even with my bringing only one rolling suitcase, I could tell if I brought more than two bags, it would not have been a pretty picture - very claustrophobic.OVERALL: I enjoy staying at this hotel. I really love the convenience of being in midtown. The price is affordable, the location is awesome. I never felt like I was too far from anything I wanted to visit, and there is always a place to get food nearby. I would definitely recommend staying here - maybe not for a week straight, as it is very small, but for a short visit, it is perfect."
158,1778,"Apr 8 2008 	Keep it a secret!	Just returned from a very nice stay at this hotel. I have never been steered wrong from any hotel I have checked on Trip Advisor, and once again was not let down.When we checked in, without asking, I was told we were upgraded from a queen bed to king. Our room was on the 5th floor - we looked directly out of the front of the hotel. We were there on a Saturday and Sunday night and never heard a sound.The breakfast room is immaculately kept up with a large variety of items - our room felt brand new - very updated.I was alone traveling with my teen and we felt totally safe in this location. We will definately be returning this summer, hopefully word won't get out too fast and there will still be bargains to be had here!"
159,1778,"Apr 7 2008 	Excellent location and excellent value	Stayed here for three nights, and was *very* impressed. I will certainly stay here again on future trips to New York.Location is superb, being just half a block away from Times Square, while being down one of the quieter cross-streets, so you're certainly not getting Times Square levels of noise.Reception area was modern, bright, gleamingly clean, and manned by friendly and professional staff. Just off the reception was a small fitness room with some gym equipment, and a business centre with two internet computers and a printer, all of which you could use for free. Complimentary continental breakfast was also included, and there was also a drinks vending machine and a flight check-in kiosk for printing boarding passes for airlines based on the USA. There's an elevator to all floors.The room was compact, but it certainly didn't feel cramped and I felt quite at home there. The bed was *very* comfortable; the TV looked brand new and had a wide range of cable channels; a writing desk, chair, coffee maker and air-con / heater were provided; and the bathroom was small but functional and clean with a very good shower.And, to top it all off, the price was excellent for central Manhattan.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, particularly tourists looking for an affordable, central base for exploring NYC. It may not be the fanciest luxury hotel in Manhattan, but for the price it's unbeatable."
160,1778,"Apr 4 2008 	Unbeatable for the location comfort and PRICE (NYC price)	We had a reservation with the other Comofort Inn &quot;Times Square&quot; which was misnomer: long blocks away from Times Square and at rather deserted area between construction and shabby establishments. So, when I saw this Comfort Inn, I just walked in and check the availability and price. I am glad I did. Other Comfort Inn was as clean as this one. But this one's location was unbeatable and LESS EXPENSIVE (Why??). Staffs are helpful. The rooms were smallish but ,like others said, clean and well furnished. As we had inside rooms, there was no noise ( but no sun either though. We had nice view of brick wall 3 feet away.) Minor issues: our bathroom door did not close properly. All the doors to the rooms slam loudly if you let it close by itself. They had a contracted garage in front of the hotel at $23/day rather than $40/day. Over all we are very satisfied with this hotel."
161,1778,"Mar 30 2008 	Shockingly pleasant!	I have a cheap boss who says things like &quot;find a room for $200 or less in Manhattan.&quot; I grudgingly booked a room at the Comfort Inn Midtown Manhattan (from which I am writing this review). The facade outside is plain but not offensive, and the lobby is a little dingy with a scary-looking breakfast room. But the elevator works fine (much faster than the Marriott Marquis across the street, and the room is surprisingly nice. It's small but very liveable, recently renovated, has a 26&quot; LG plasma TV, ample lighting, a small but useable desk, a full-length mirror and a larger-than-expected bathroom (with a good-sized shower, curved shower rod, and granite counter + a small window). The a/c is a window unit, which might be bad in summer. The bedding is acceptable and the dark wood furniture is appealingly updated. There's a nice valence above the curtains. There's no view, but I asked for a room at the back of the hotel based on reviews read at TripAdvisor. So far, it's quiet. There's even a (very small) exercise room on the first floor with a treadmill and bike. So far, I am really amazingly impressed with this room given the bargain basement price."
162,1778,"Mar 24 2008 	We love this place!	This is a wonderful hotel. The rates are reasonable, and the rooms have just been re-done. Some of the rooms are a bit small, but who spends much time in the room? The location can't be beat... right in the Times Square area and near many theatres. The complimentary breakfast offers plenty of choices, and the hotel staff is very friendly. We stay there every time we go to NYC."
163,1778,"Mar 22 2008 	Wow!	I hestitate to write a review as I'd love to keep this place a secret!The staff are very friendly and helpful. We would phone them from the streets of New York to get advice and information.The rooms are extremely clean, and very quiet - must be well insulated as we weren't disturbed by any outside noises. Although the rooms are a bit small, there's enough room to store your baggage and move around with no problem.Free Continental breakfast and internet access is indeed a plus.Only one elevator, but we never waited for more than one minute for the elevator and we were on the top (9th floor) and the hotel was completely booked.Perfect location. Just down the street from Times Square and Broadway theatres.Room rate we received was very reasonable and one of the cheapest I found when looking for a NYC hotel .... and I checked rates and reviews of hundreds of hotels.The secret is out! This is the place to stay and we will be back."
164,1778,"Mar 3 2008 	Great Hotel	My husband and I checked in on Feb 29th and stayed for two nights. The room was modern and very clean. We were pleasantly surprised as this is a &quot;2star&quot; hotel. The room was small but not nearly as small as I had anticipated. The staff were friendly and nice. The free continental breakfast was great, nothing over the top, just pastries, cereal, bread, bagels etc. There was no restaurant in the hotel but this was not a problem for us as we really didn't spend anytime in the hotel. The location was excellent less than 1 block from times square. The outside noise was a little loud at night but we were in NY so we didn't expect it to be like home. If we are ever back in NY we will definately stay at this hotel again"
165,1778,"Mar 3 2008	Great Value in Midtown Manhattan	I'm just back from a great stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown. I've stayed in a number of hotels in this price range and location, and the Comfort Inn was easily the best. Clean, comfortable and convenient, with working air conditioning (even in February, hotel rooms in New York are always hot), a great location (between Broadway and 6th Avenue, right in the theater district), and free continental breakfast and wireless internet. My room was quiet and comfortable, and the location couldn't have been more convenient. I'll definitely be staying there again."
166,1778,"Jan 30 2008 	A great deal on a nice room	I am just finishing a 5 day stay here and, while I have stayed in nicer hotels and bigger rooms, it's been years since I've had a better location, with a brand new room, super clean, comfortable, with free WiFi and breakfast, plus free coffee 24/7 in the lobby, plus a coffeemaker in my room for this price. The wired internet is even faster, with plugs right on the desk. Yes, the bathroom is tight but perfectly workable. My queen bed looked and felt brand new. I was on the 46th street side (at the front of the hotel), so I got a little street noise but this IS Manhattan--it's part of the &quot;charm.&quot; Nothing ever woke me up. I stayed both on weekend and weeknights; the weekend was much more expensive, but the weeknights were among the lowest price I found."
167,1778,"Jan 23 2008 	Awesome find!! Excellent location	Just got home from our stay and felt I must write a review about this great hotel. First of all I would have given this hotel an excellent rating but the wireless internet access is horrible. Spotty at best throughout the entire hotel, including the lobby and breakfast area too. And this was common amongst all guests I talked with. (Although you can use their computer room which has two computers with a laser printer you can print to for free.) EXCELLENT location!! Just a half block from the Times Square area. Lots of food, shopping, theaters nearby. VERY close to the TKTS office where you can buy same day theater tickets for up to half price. My party had three rooms and all were in close location to each other. Newly renovated rooms. And I mean completely renovated. Nice flat screen LG LED tv. Good bed. Decor, paint, trim, furnishings were all new! Quiet room, except for the occasional sirens, trash trucks, etc but not objectionable in my opinion. Front desk staff were helpful and polite. Breakfast room was small but adequate, and CLEAN. Maid staff pleasant too. I could go on with lavish praises and address some of the negative reviews others have left but won't. I do wish to address the comment from one reviewer who complained that he/she couldn't get their money back within the 24 hour cancellation period because of their cancelled flight. This person stated it was unethical and &quot;I don't have control over the weather&quot;. Well neither does the hotel. It's only fair for the hotel to charge, at least for one night's stay, since they may be out a room fare for the night until they get another person to take the room. Overall our stay, all persons in all three rooms, was very enjoyable and we looked forward to returning to our rooms after each day's activities. I will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and I will make all my stays to the NY Times Square area at this hotel!!!"
168,1778,"Jan 22 2008 	Great reasonable place to stay near theatres in NYC	We just returned from a 3 night weekend at the Midtown Comfort Inn on 46th Street. The accomodations are very clean and nice (small but this is NYC) the front desk staff were very helpful and friendly, and for NYC it was quite reasonable (under $200 a night). The hotel is 1/2 block off Broadway at Times Square, so if you are going for theater you can't do better. They even have a few rooms with two double beds (for a small family). We recommend strongly."
169,1778,"Jan 19 2008 	Great find!	This is a very nice hotel in a very busy location. Staying on 46th Street during Christmas week is not for the faint of heart, but the hotel proved to be a quiet spot of sanity in the middle of it all. We took friends who'd never been to NYC before, and they enjoyed the stay as well. The staff was friendly and courteous, and the rooms were very clean and typical size (small for all of you not familiar) for NYC. The rooms were also quiet, and the beds were comfortable, which is a bonus for the location. We had breakfast in the lounge of bagels and other pastires, fruit, etc. which was convenient and spared us the overcrowded spots in the vicinity,All in all we were very pleased with our stay and we'll be back next visit."
170,1778,"Jan 18 2008 	The worst customer service I've ever experienced	I booked my reservation through the hotel chains website. This hotel has a 24 hr cancellation policy which I fully understand. Until my flight was cancelled due to the weather in NY on the day of my arrival. I immediately called the hotel to notify them of this dilemma and asked if I'd still be charged. I was told yes, so I asked to speak to the manager. I believe ethically this is wrong, considering I don't have control over the weather. I had to leave her a voicemail and after 24 hrs and no response I tried to contact her again. This time I was successful, only to hear her say in an extremely rude attitude that she would not make any exceptions, and that I would still be charged. Which I was. She then proceeded to tell me that after looking at my previous stays with the Applecore chain, that &quot;I didn't look so much like a valued customer to her&quot;."
171,1778,"Jan 14 2008	Was perfectly happy with it!	I have no complaints at all about the hotel. I was a little nervous coming in as a lone female traveller after an 18 hour flight, but all was fine. I had a renovated room on 2nd level- facing the back, so no view, but no issues with noise either. There was *just* enough space for me but i'm 5 foot 2, and there was only me- a couple would have found the room very tiny. Bathroom was very clean- great work!- but again, bigger-sized travellers would find the shower tight. Location was good- near enough the main road to feel safe, but not so near that the babble in TIme Square would intrude. I liked that i could walk to Broadway for some action and plays, and then to 6th/5th avenue to look for decent food in a quieter place. All in all, more than adequate for my needs. I felt compelled to write as i use TripAdvisor alot in decided my hotel- so hope this review helps someone else!"
172,1778,"Jan 13 2008 	What a Little Gem!!	I decided to book this hotel for a little mini- vacation for my wife and I after reading the reviews posted here. This was our first trip to NY so I wanted it to be a good experience for us. I was a little concerned about the noise that some of the other reviewers had mentioned, but decided to book this hotel anyway. We had room in the back of the hotel so there was little to no noise that was heard from the street (outside of the police and ambulance sirens). But hey you are in the heart of the city, so no complaints here. The doors as mention in many previous reviews do slam, because people allow them to slam. Our door slammed after the first time we entered the room and once we realized that the door did that, we had enough common sense to not allow the door to slam and to be courteous to our fellow travelers. I would suggest that the hotel invest in some type of mechanism so that door cannot be slammed. The most time that this is noticed is in the morning though when people are leaving. This is my only complaint and the only reason I couldn't give the hotel an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating. Now on to the GREAT things about this hotel:Location: Excellent!The location can not be beat. It is situated 1/2 block from Time Square, the Theaters and many fine restaurants. Everything is so close, from major banks ( Bank of America, Wachovia, Chase,etc), and a 24hr pharmacy within a 1 block radius. The street the hotel is on is relatively quite, but lined with restaurants. The sidewalks also were not as congested as they are on the main drag (Broadway).Accommodations: Excellent Value!The Hotel was spotless from the lobby to our room.Our room appeared to have been newly renovated, and the decor was wonderful. It had all of the usually mainstays of an iron, ironing board, coffee maker with tea (decaf &amp; regular) and coffee (decaf &amp; regular). There is no refrigerator or microwave oven though. The only time we wished we had a fridge or microwave was when we wanted to bring some food back from BECCO (which by the way is a must if you love Italian food!!). The bed was very comfortable and everything was very, very clean (I was looking for any type of dirt or grime and there was none to be found.) There is free wireless internet connection, which is great to plot your day out from your room or make reservations if you want. There was a 42&quot; plasma TV and adequate room for luggage in the closet. The room is very comfortable for 2 people to move around.Our view from our room was of the building next door, which didn't bother us not one bit, because we were out all day and didn't return until it was time to shut our eyes. Hey you come to New York to enjoy the city not watch it go by from your room anyway, right? :)The elevator was small and I didn't really notice that it was super slow. It brought us up and it brought us down. The breakfast was plentiful to start your day. It's nice to be able to go down stairs and a get something to get your day started. The breakfast consisted of a variety of cereal, 2% milk, boiled eggs, waffles, assorted fruit, orange juice, apple juice, coffee (regular &amp; decaf), breakfast muffins and even Red Bull energy drink. All this while reading your complimentary copy of the NY Times and USA Today. This is good way to save a few more dollars for stuff that you really want to spend money on.While we drove to New York instead of flying, there is a little kiosk in the lobby to check on your flight, in addition to the computers in the business center. There is also a small fitness center, which we didn't use as we got plenty of exercise walking all around the city and taking in the sights.Price: Excellent Value!I searched many hotels prior to booking this one, and you cannot beat the price. We paid $248 + tax per night for New Year's weekend! All other hotels were charging nearly twice as much. I am sooo glad that I decided to book here. There is certainly a lot of bang for your buck, and there was no compromise on the accommodations, staff friendliness/helpfulness and location. There is a parking garage located across the street that charges a discounted rate for staying at the hotel of $25 per day. Add $10 on top of the total if you drive an oversized vehicle.The hotel is located directly across the street from the &quot;Muse&quot; hotel which has rates twice as much as the Comfort Inn. I have to admit, I laughed each time I walked out of our hotel and looked across the street and people coming out of the Muse and thought &quot;you have no idea how much money you are throwing away&quot;. This hotel is a little gem right in the heart of the city! I will be back and would recommend this location to a friend without any hesitation."
173,1778,"Jan 11 2008 	5th time can't be that bad !	Stayed here for the 5th time last December. You know what your getting before you go and as for location, well you couldn't ask for more. Firstly the downside, of which there aren't many. If you get a room to the rear of the hotrel the odds are that your 'view' will consist of a brick wall. That said you ae very rarely in your room during daylight hours and the rear rooms are quieter than those at the front on West 35th Street.The rooms aren't cheap, in monetary terms, a 5 night stay cost us around 900. Although there is a continental breafast thrown in !Pluses are many. Desk staff are very helpful, the hotel is in a great location, the rooms are fairly well appointed, if a little dark. There are numerous eating and drinking locations all around you and the shops and sights are virtually on your dooor step.Don't expect the Ritz, if you want that go pay Ritz prices but for the centre of New York city we feel tat it is a fair price for a clean room and bed."
174,1778,"Jan 7 2008 	Great Price Great Location but Bring Ear Plugs!	We decided to book this hotel for our first ever trip to NY Dec 07. It was a late minute booking, as we had found fantastic rates for flights only a few week before we were due to leave! Comfort Inn Midtown was the cheapest hotel we found and included a continental breakfast which was perfect.I was a little scared at what we would find after reading some reviews on here, but we had none of the problems others' found, save for the noise issue, which I'll go into later. The HotelThe hotel is located less then half a block away from Times Square. From our window we could see Times Square's TGI Friday and all the lights and billboards. It is also very close to train and bus links and we never had a long wait hailing a taxi.If you are coming to NY for the first time, or just want to stay where the atmosphere and livliness is, then I'd definately reccommend this hotel.As it was booked as a suprise for our anniversary I contacted the hotel and asked if something special could be done for our stay, like a complimanary bottle of wine or similar. I was in contact with an amazing member of staff called Anu. He was so helpful with all my questions about the hotel, it was more like 5 star service! When we arrived, it turned out we had be upgraded to a brand new HUGE room!The downstairs features a small gym, the breakfast room, a toilet, luggage hold (which is free) and a computer room (again, free) The RoomWe stayed in room 902, overlooking the street and the Muse Hotel. Again, the room was amazing. We had plently of room for our suitcases and the bathroom was huge and well appointed, with a shower, bath, loo and sink. The hairdryer was loctaed in the bathroom in it's own unit. I'd heard rooms in NY were teeny, but this was bigger than some rooms I've stayed in in the UK by far.As for the main bedroom, we had two huge windows which let in a lot of light despite the massive buildings outside. The fire escape on the outside of the building looked amazing (a small point I know, but at least it fit in with the character of the room and building!) The bed was huge. WE have a superking size bed at home, and this bed was a little smaller, not by much though. There is also a flat panel TV with about thirty channels (Check out the adverts... so unbelieveably strange!), a dest with powerpoints for your laptop and a chest of drawers to keep clothes in. The coffee make was on top of the chest of drawers.Next to the entrance was a cupboard with the iron and ironing board, a rail with hangers to hang clothes, and a shelf (we didn't use it, but it could be great to keep the suitcase in)It was clean (all except under the bed, don't look under there if you're a clean freak like me!) and tidy and didn't smell at all! ServiceWe found all the staff to be welcoming and helpful. Check-in was quick and easy, and only took around five minutes. We were always greeted with a smile and a 'Morning!' or 'Afternoon!' which was a pleasant change form the NY'ers brashness! BreakfastBreakfast was served from 7am til 10:30am. We mainly ate around 8ish. There was a wide variety of food. Cereal: Corn Flakes, Alpen-like nutty cereal and I think Rice Krispies. Bagels in every flavour were available, as well as Dunkin Doughnuts (which was a treat!) There was also toast and waffles too.Coffee, cappucino, tea and herbal teas were on offer, as well as OJ, AJ, Coke and Redbull (perfect for a much needed engery boost!)Everything was well stocked early morning, however on the few days we got up later (about 9ish) it was much harder to find exactly what you wanted, or a place to sit.Papers were available free of charge. The NoiseWhen I booked this hotel, I was a little anxious about it being loud. I have problems sleeping, acute insomnia means it takes me at least an hour (in silent conditions) to fall asleep, and being a light sleeper means the slightest noise will wake me bolt upright. A little annoying.Bearing the fact we were staying so close to Times Square in mind, I took earplugs and hoped for the best.The first night we were so jet lagged we fell asleep about 7pm (and woke up at 4am) No problems at all. The only thing that woke me was the next room coming in about 9pm after a meal and letting the door slam shut. The doors are quite noisey.The rest of the holiday the only noise we heard from the hotel was the occasional door slam (from the highly inconsiderate neighbours next door).Outside, there was a lorry-loading area which was the main problem. It started about 4am and didn't stop for an hour. Basically, they load metal pipes and things onto the lorries which then drive off. Reversing beeps, the noise of the carriers being loaded and the drivers and workers swearing and laughing at each other kept me awake, however with ear-plugs this wasn't a problem, and I slept like a baby! We also found the window wasn't quite shut properly (despite the fact they shouldn't have been opened) so once we closed it properly that muted the sounds a little.I would definately reccommend earplugs if you're a light sleeper. My bloke is a heavy sleeper and didn't hear a thing! Pros and ConsPRO'sFantastic locationGreat staffAmazing roomBreakfast choice was brilliantCheap for the location!Any problems we had (Like the next room smoking which made ours smell disgusting) were quickly attended to.CON'sNoise (only if you're a very light sleeper)"
175,1778,"Dec 31 2007 	Wonderful place by low price!!	My first visit in New York, we didn't know where to stay, then, by walk, we found this exceptional hotel: clean, no noisy on the apartment in the back, low price and a friendly staff...."
176,1778,"Dec 4 2007 	Nice hotel good location but noisy	I finally chose the Comfot Inn Midtown after extensive searching and reading many reviews on Tripadvisor and other websites. I had previously had a great stay at the Comfort Inn Manhattan but was put off by recent reviews. So the Comfort Inn Midtown. The hotel is being renovated which did not personally cause me any problems, but could be inconvenient to others. I think most of the renovation is finished now anyway. The staff are very helpful, the breakfast is good and a real plus point: bagels, donuts, toast, waffles, pastries yes, but also, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juice, eggs and hot drinks. There are two PC's for internet use, and apat from once when one guest selfishly used the PC for ages, there was always a free PC. The hotel is in an excellent location, literally around the corner from Times Square. This however means that if you have a room at the front of the hotel it is very noisy. If you are a light sleeper, ask for a room in the back. The noise from the street was incredible and constant. This is the only negative aspect. We had room 602, which was a very good size, the bathroom was big and the room was nice and comfy. I think all the rooms ending in 01 / 02 are quite big, but they are at the front. If you call ahead to request, they should be able to accommodate you."
177,1778,"Dec 2 2007 	Great New York hotel	Our family had two rooms during Thanksgiving Weekend. The rooms were small (typical NYC) but clean, very quiet, comfortable bed (upgraded to king!), recently re-decorated,big TV, spacious bathroom. Staff was delightful...welcoming and friendly. Breakfast room was small but adequate ... simple continental breakfast with fresh whole fruit and pastries. Coffee/tea available all day. Convenient to Times Sq (half a block) and subways (2 blocks). A great place to stay in NYC for a reasonable price. Nancy"
178,1778,"Nov 26 2007	small and noisy but clean	The only positive comment I have about this hotel is that it was clean. The rooms were very small, I was actually very surprised at how small they were. The pictures on the website were not very accurate as far as that goes. We got a room with one queen bed and that was all that fit in the room, literally. You really had to squeeze your way around the bed, between it and the desk/chair, to get around. And the other problem was the noise, from loud water pipes in the walls every time a toilet was flushed or shower started, to room doors loudly slamming, to people scrubbing down and painting the hallway walls at 8:00 in the morning. I thought it was very rude that they would do that so early in the morning. I would have much rather spent an extra $100 or so just to get a good night's sleep. I would recommend you do the same."
179,1778,"Nov 25 2007	Nice Location	Small room, but according to other reviews of comparable hotels, the room size was OK. I was still a little shocked though. Very near to Time Square, about a block away. Appears safe, even though it was located on somewhat of a dark street. Hotel staff was never off the phone, so it was hard to talk to them about much. Room was in good condition...just remodeled. Great value for a place next to Time Square for such a good price. Continental breakfast in the morning was good as well. I don't think you'll be disappointed since the price is so low!"
180,1778,"Nov 25 2007 	Excellent hotel just off Times Square!	We've just got back from staying here for 4 nights, and everything about the hotel was great. Excellent service, nothing was too much trouble, the breakfast was a great way to start the day and all the staff were very welcoming, it was like a home from home.The hotel is in an excellent location, literally 2 mins walk from Times Square, and also handy for Macey's (10min walk) and many other attractions within a short distance. The hotel inside is very clean, and modernly decorated. The room had all the amenities.. hairdryer, Iron, tea / coffee making facilities, nice big comfortable bed and big LCD TV. The smaller touches, such as complimentary internet access and free newspapers in reception were also available. Next time we go to New York we will definately stay here again.. We'd like to thank all the hotel staff for making our stay as enjoyable and comfortable as it was. Hope to see them all again next year (money permitting!!)."
181,1778,"Nov 24 2007	Best Location 	My fiance and I stayed here for 5 nights, during a very hot May!It was located in a fantasic place, couldn't ask to be nearer to anything! 3 - 5min walk to Macy's and round the corner to the Empire State. Every night we walked about 10-15mins up Broadway to Time Square - it was easy and so safe. The rooms, yes are a little dated, but as it is just a base at the end of the day, we weren't too bothered! Big room with small ensuite. TV with cable, hairdyer etc - what you would expect.I advise anyone to plan ahead before going to New York. We pre-booked our tickets for the Statue of Liberty Ferry at home before we left, and therefore didn't have to queue! We did go early in the morning however! Also I advise you to be at the Empire State for 8am - as the queues become huge and I'm sure you don't want to spend half your holiday stuck in one!We also pre-booked a helicopter flight across the city - which was fantastic! Yes, you can take your own cameras - dispite some reviews! The breakfast at the hotel was typically 'American' and sugary! But hey, it was lovely! Different selection of doughnuts, bagels with cream cheese, various cereals, juice, eggs. This was an added bonus, as most NYC hotels don't include breakfast in their tariff. We only had one quibble with the hotel....on our last night we had just come back from Bubba Gump Restaurant on TImes Square (highly reccommend it) and as we entered the room a mouse ran across the floor - understandable in these older buildings. But I was not going to sleep in a room where the mouse had run under the bed!!!We asked at reception to be moved they were fine about it. However the first room they moved us to was a smoking room (it stank) and the beds were unmade. SO they moved us to another room. Still a bit smokey though. It was our last night so we didn't care. Another things was the VERY RUDE bell boy! We encountered him within the 1st 10minutes of or stay - he grabs your bags like a leach!We knew tipping was a big thing in NY, but we only had a dollar bill and a 50! So I gave him the dollar bill....He responded, not wth a kind thankyou - but....I wouldn't even give a Mexcian that!! I thought..How rude and racist! I should have taken it back off him, he was lucky to get anything! We're not stingy, but we didn't think we'd be rudely put upon within our first 10 minutes!! We stayed away form him on our way home, we carried our own bags! Rude Man!!However, I would recommend the hotel, due to its location and value for money. Staff were friendly on the counter, but stay away from the bell boy!!!!"
182,1778,"Nov 18 2007 	Exceeded My Expectations	We stayed in a newly renovated room. It was a bit crowded with furniture, but very well thought-out and attractive. The bathroom was larger than expected. Our window faced an air-shaft, so it was very quiet. The soundproofing between rooms also seemed to be good. The breakfast was just fine. We paid between $304 and $395 per night, depending on the night of the week. The location is ideal for theater-going and close to several subway stops. Overall, this hotel exceeded my expectations. I'd stay there again."
183,1778,"Nov 17 2007 	good price	The price was right. Everything was small but that didn't matter since it was just a place to sleep. We requested a queen size bed and got a king size. The staff was very friendly. The biggest problem was the elevator: small, slow, and sometimes broken. And there was only one for service and patrons."
184,1778,"Nov 11 2007 	Nice Times Square Location	I chose this hotel for the reasonable price during high season after reading the many reviews here. We were only in NY for one night and had theater tickets and chose to stay in TS. Overall, we were pleased with our experience. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Thank you! My only complaint, and it's a big one for me, was that even though the hotel is a non-smoking one our room had a strong smoke smell. The non-smoking aspect is a major one when I book any hotel. This hotel was booked so we were stuck. Also, coincidently, in our &quot;wing&quot; ours was the only door that didn't have a non-smoking sign on the outside. The room was small but we expected that. The carpet was not too clean, worn in parts, and had cigarette burns. The bathroom was nice &amp; roomy and clean. Extra large sink was a nice touch. The bed was okay to sleep in. The hotel was extremely quiet which is also a plus. There was a coffee maker, iron &amp; ironing board. Closet was very short which worked ok for us but from the rod to floor was only about 4 feet. The free continental breakfast is an added benefit. For a longer stay, I would not have been comfortable here but for our short stay, it was fine."
185,1778,"Oct 30 2007 	Recommend to all	This is a good quality hotel located just off Times Square. Some rooms are currently been renovated but all are too a good standard (considering some floors were being renovated you never heard any noise!). Some rooms are small but if you are like us you will only be in them when going to sleep!The hotel is on a quiet road off Times Square, it seems it is not one of the main access streets so the traffic was quite quiet.There is continental breakfast available till 10am which meant we could fill up on food before heading out for the day. Rooms are cleaned every day &amp; towels are replaced.All the staff were friendly &amp; there was tea &amp; coffee, internet access and a small gym available free of charge all day.If you are looking for a clean, well maintained hotel not far from the action this hotel is for you."
186,1778,"Oct 11 2007 	Hidden Treasure Just Off Broadway	My stay at the Comfort Inn was from Sept 30- Oct 4, 2007. I was not expecting luxury as it is one of a few reasonably priced ($240/night) near Times Square, but now that Ive returned, I would have been so disappointed if Id missed this gem!To say the location is perfect is an understatement. The hotel is  block from Broadway and 1  blocks from Times Square, one block from a subway, and two blocks from restaurant row. There is also a stop for the hop on/hop off bus tours and city buses at the corner (less than one minute walk). You are within a five minute walk to many of the major attractions (MTV studios, NBC, Rockefeller, all Broadway theatres, 42nd Street, etc). With that said, the hotel is actually very quiet and secluded (though I always felt safe, no matter what time of the day or night), tucked away from the hustle and bustle half a block away.The hotel itself was very nice. The staff is so friendly and helpful, and always greets you with kindness when you enter the lobby. My room (and my companion's room as well) was immaculately clean, spacious by New York standards, nicely decorated with kind of funky prints, and it has in-room coffee and tea (such a plus, and one lacking from the rooms at other hotels in the immediate area with rates upwards of $600/night). The bed and linens were very clean, and though the mattress was too hard for my personal taste, my travelling companion thought it was perfect. Continental breakfast is also served from 7-10 am and is included in the price of your room.The Comfort Inn was a perfect home base for all my travels in New York, and I hope to stay there each time I return. Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions!"
187,1778,"Oct 4 2007 	Great location friendly staff 	Stayed 9 days 24 Sept-3 Oct 2007. In summary, the hotel is in a good central location, is well kept and is good value compared to other hotels. We chose this hotel from the reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel is well decorated and kept clean &amp; the complimentary breakfast helped every day get off to a good start. The hotel location is great, on a relatively quiet side street near to everything (theatres, restaurants, 5th avenue shops, Central Park, Bryant Park &amp; many museums &amp; galleries. We walked to most places easily as NY is flat. For our first few days we did the 'hop on and off' Gray Line bus tours and found this was a great way to get to know the city - the tour guides commentaries were informative &amp; entertaining.At the hotel we were given a large front (street) facing room on arrival. We found this a bit noisy (when the garbage was collected in the morning) so mentioned this to reception on the following morning. They were happy to organise an immediate move to a room which was totally quiet (as the staff had promised). It was smaller than the front room but we were very happy with it as the room had recently been refurbished and was really nice. The view from the window was of an adjacent wall - but we didn't care as the room was our base to sleep. During the day and the evenings we were living in New York, not the hotel room!"
188,1778,"Sep 29 2007 	Perfect spot for Times Square Stay	This place is only 1 block from Times Square, Rockefeller and several subway lines. Staff were very professional, and many were same staff from our stay 2 years before-they must like it too! Breakfast was included and was an excellent start to the day. Room is small, as most NYC rooms are, but has been redone since our last stay and is very nice, and still very clean. And the mature rate price was unbeatable for Times Square location."
189,1778,"Sep 28 2007 	perfect for the weekend!	My husband and I stayed at the Comfort In Midtown from Sep. 21st to Sep. 23. We arrived with no problem or lineup at the hotel. we were able to go to our room immediately. The front desk clerk (Jevanni) (not sure of the spelling) was excellen and efficient. We were on the 8th floor in room 800. The elevator is small....actually the entire hotel is small in stature. It's very narrow and tall. Our room was small but well appointed. It had a queen bed with one end table and a desk. There was a tv, a window w/ AC and a bathroom. There was an ironing board and iron and a hairdryer. The room was exceptionally clean! The bed was very comfortable. I have never slept so well in a hotel before. I don't think it was all the bed I think it also had something to do with the amount of walking we did on Friday and Saturday! The view we had was of a brick wall but other than the initial first few minutes of being in the room we never really needed to look out side because we were...well....outside ourselves. The bathroom was spotless and once we let the water run a bit in the a.m. the hot water was plentiful. If you are undecided about staying at this hotel and you need a few reasons to tip the scale in favour of it then here are some:1-Continental breakfast!!!! Do not underestimate the value of not having to think about the first meal of the day. This was such a nice feature, you get up and eat and you're off to see NYC. The bagels were really really fresh and delicious too.2-Staff, they were very friendly and helpful!3-Proximity to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, Broadway Shows are literally on your doorstep.4-Cleanliness5-Efficient If you are there for a weekend definetly use the hop on/off tours by grayline. You can't miss them there are ticket sellers on every corner in Times Square.Hope this helps!"
190,1778,"Sep 12 2007 	Good mid-priced hotel in prime Manhattan location	The last time I was in Manhattan (last summer), I stayed in Econo Lodge Times Square (W 47th St.). It was an excellent value at under $150 per night. I planned to stay there again this year; however, when I checked the price for this year's trip, I was astounded to see that the price had doubled, so I looked at other options. I ended up staying at Comfort Inn Midtown, which was just a couple of blocks away and was now practically the same price as the Econo Lodge. (I paid $240-$270 for each of the 3 nights I stayed--Saturday, Sunday, Monday.)I was pleasantly surprised because Comfort Inn's bedrooms were twice as large, as was the bathroom. In addition, unlike the Econo Lodge, the Comfort Inn had an exercise room and an office with 2 computers; it also had a larger lobby and more soda machines. The breakfast was also a bit better. It included cereal, donuts, bagles, bananas, apples, mixed nuts, dried cranberries and white raisins, frozen waffles, yogurt, boiled eggs, coffee, juice, cappuccino, and even Red Bull (regular and sugar free). The location is ideal, as it is just a few blocks from the main activities in Midtown Manhattan, including Broadway, Times Square, 42nd Steet, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave, and the Museum of Modern Art. Although it is just a few hundred feet from the busiest part of Manhattan (the real core of the Big Apple), it is not excessively loud, because it is half a block off of the main strip. The view is not great. In fact, the only window in our room overlooked a tiny enclosed court; the only thing you could see were the windows of other people's rooms. The staff was generally friendly and helpful. I forgot to bring shaving cream. I inquired at the front desk if they had any. The woman at first said they had none. But, as I was walking away, she took the extra step of asking the man who is apparently in charge of supplies (he supplies the breakfast area, for example) if he knew of any. He not only found me a travel-sized shaving cream but even a couple of razors (which I didn't even ask for). They also went out of their way to help me arrange the receipts for a complicated payment arrangement that I had.Granted, this is not the Marriott Marquis (which is literally right across the street), but, then again, it costs only about half as much as the Marriott. Unless you are planning to spend a lot of time in your room while in Manhattan (who does that anyway?), choose this hotel as a great mid-level hotel. If you are on a tight budget, check the rates at the Econo Lodge first, but, unless it is substantially cheaper (at least $50-$100 cheaper), go ahead and book at the Comfort Inn because it is much roomier and has many more amenities."

192,1778,"Aug 19 2007 	lovely hotel perfect location	I stayed at this hotel 11th - 16th Aug 2007. I didn't know what to expect due to the different reviews but was pleasantly surprised. We stayed in room 902 which had obviously been redecorated and had new furniture. It was really lovely. The free breakfast consisted of cereal, toast, bagels, danish pastry, yogurts and fruit. A good start to the day!The hotel staff are very friendly and the free internet in the lobby was a great help for when we wanted to look things up.New York is a fantastic place, we loved it but now need a holiday to get over it!!!Take comfortable shoes, you will walk for miles. The subway is handy and cheap compared to the UK underground.Top of the Rockfeller is a must at night, it's an amazing sight and you can have your photo done with the empire state building in the background. Enjoy your trip!"
193,1778,"Aug 19 2007 	Another Great Stay	This is our second trip to NYC where we used this hotel. Once again, we come away strongly recommending the Comfort Inn.We arrived for a two night stay in late July. We had booked the room at least six months in advance for $166 per night using the Choice Hotels website, under the &quot;internet users&quot; special rate. We were placed in one of the newly refurbished rooms on the 9th floor. The good: LOCATION(!), clean, new furnishings, great size (for a NYC hotel room), quiet (with regard to other hotel guests.) The bad: since we were on the front of the hotel, the noise from the garbage trucks seemed to go on all night long, the window air conditioner was quite loud (although, it does help drown out the garbage trucks!), the elevator is (still) quite slow, which was not a real big problem because the hotel was not anywhere near 100% occupied for our two nights.The staff, as before, was fabulous. What amazed me is that I remembered most of the staff from my visit here two years earlier. I did not expect that the same people would be working the front desk, the bellman positions, etc. This is the kind of stability that says something about a little hotel such as this.As before, is it the Marriot Marquis? No, that's one block to the West! It's also $400 bucks a night. I would much rather use the extra $200 per night and go out and DO something in NYC with that money. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you have about this property."
194,1778,"Aug 7 2007 	Prices have gone through the roof!	We have stayed at this hotel for years for its location and earlier affordibility. Last time we went, we were pleasantly surpised to see the upgrades and were told they were also replacing the furniture. Prices had increased a bit, but it was still reasonable.We came home and I was just about to plan our next trip. Much to our DISAPPOINTMENT, we now find that the prices have DOUBLED! We won't be coming back!"
195,1778,"Jul 25 2007 	Comfort Inn Comfort	We stayed at this Comfort Inn and we were very pleased with it. It is in a great location....Right in Times Square. However it was very quiet. No street noises. The rooms were on the small side but nicely kept and very clean. The free breakfast was great and we appreciated the 24 hour access to coffee, tea , a microwave and the internet with a printer. Most appreciated was the very helpful and extremely nice staff . The General Manager,the people on the front desk , housekeeping, the bellmen were all friendly . They made our stay very nice. Also for a New York hotel in that area the rate was very reasonable. I would stay there again for sure."
196,1778,"Jul 20 2007 	Clean and right in midtown	We spent one night here after going to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium and before heading on a longer trip. The hotel is very close to Times Square, so it is right in the heart of midtown Manhattan. Our room was clean and comfortable. It was small, but considering the location and price, no complaints there. The wireless Internet was easy, fast, and reliable. The only downsides we had were with checkin. We drove in and needed to unload and park. We found the hotel, but the unloading area was full and there's no other parking on the street. We called the front desk to see if we could just park and they said to come to the front to unload anyway. After going around the block (which is a 15-20 minute undertaking in NYC), we were able to park in front. We then found that the hotel was short staffed and rooms were just being cleaned. They said 15 minutes, so I decided we'd park in the garage with the hotel rate and check in after that. Of course, the entrance to the garage was just a bit in the wrong direction on 46th. So around the block again for 20 minutes to the garage. When we got back to the front desk, the room was still not ready (he said 15 minutes again) but offered to take our bags so we could go look around. But before we got a chance to leave, good news, the room was ready so we went up. So really, my only complaint is that the desk should have told us in the first place where to park to avoid the two trips around the block. But beyond all of that, we had a great experience and would gladly stay here again."
197,1778,"Jul 10 2007 	Just back from a one night stay	We enjoyed our brief stay at this hotel. It's well-located in the heart of midtown and the price, while somewhat expensive, was excellent compared to comparable hotels in Manhattan. There is a 24-hour exercise room and free continental breakfast available. The front desk staff was exceptionally pleasant -- when I casually mentioned that it was my birthday, the guy at the desk ran to the back office and handed me a promotional package of various samples (gum, lotion, razor, etc.) as a present. The hallways are small and cramped, but the room was a good size (especially for New York) and was clean. Only a few minor complaints - all of the bedding, other than the pillowcases, was stiff and scratchy. Also, the air conditioner (a window unit) was somewhat weak. We turned it on to full blast at nine o'clock at night and the room was still pretty warm 3 hours later, although it was cool by morning. These are pretty minor quibbles, though. Overall, I think this hotel is a great value for New York."
198,1778,"Jul 3 2007 	Nice hotel for the money.	Hi I'm from the UK and visited NY as a tourist for a week. I liked the Comfort Inn Midtown because the location is excellent. Its half a block away from the middle of Times Square, you can see the neon signs from the front door of the hotel, so you are already in the heart of the tourist area and subway links. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly. There are a couple of computers on the ground floor with free internet access which was ace and there is a tiny gym room with a couple of treadmills too which is a nice touch. Though I didn't see anyone using the gym, not surprising with downtown NY just outside. There was free breakfast in mornings in the little dining room off the lobby. I ate so much that I wouldn't get hungry again until about 3pm, and no one cared which is great. OK the view from my room was rubbish, my key card kept failing and there is only one lift for the entire hotel but for the price its pretty cool. I'd definately go back and I recommend it to others. Thanks for reading!"
199,1778,"Jun 13 2007 	Great deal for the price	I stayed in this hotel in March for a professional conference because I couldn't afford the conference hotel (Hilton) without a roommate. The rooms at Comfort Inn are small, but perfect for one person or for a couple. The best part about this hotel is its location. You look outside the front lobby and you are literally looking right at Times Square less than a block away. It's also within easy walking distance of the north part of Midtown like Rockefeller Center. My first experience upon check-in was not positive, but the experience improved significantly. The TV in my first room did not receive CBS and March Madness was in full swing. They changed me to another room and the air conditioner did not work. It was March and chilly, but I need air to sleep. The maintenance man was ready to send me to another hotel but the manager took care of me. Third time's the charm and the third room was great. Aside from the small room size, the only other drawbacks were that the shower was extremely small -- not to be disrespectful, but an overweight person could not use the shower -- and the hotel seems older with old carpet, etc. But everything did seem clean, which is more important to me than new.The positives far outweight the negatives. The staff seemed friendly (especially by New York standards) and willing to help. The breakfast room offered a free continental breakfast. Two days I sat down and had toast, yogurt, fruit, etc., and two days I grabbed a muffin and coffee and headed out the door. Both ways saved me at least $10 to $15 a day.The other nice freebie is Internet service. There are two computers and a printer. I was able to check my e-mail every day and print my boarding pass for my departing flight. People were friendly and willing to share -- no one hogged a computer for hours. We did our business and moved on. There was also a treadmill but I was too lazy to use it.Overall, you CANNOT GO WRONG with this hotel if you want to be close to the action but not close to the price of most New York hotels. I absolutely recommend it."
200,1778,"Jun 7 2007 	Rooms are small but adequate	The hotel is at the Times Square area, so everything is walking distance, lots of restaurants available but would recommend to venture out of midtown to get a better bargain for your money. The street it wsa on is called Litle Brazil, so lots of Spanish style restaurants which were good.Hotel itself was okay for our budget, rooms just about fit the queen size bed. Bathroom was very clean. My only inconvenience was airconditioning, it was not adequate, it was old and obsolete. It did not cool the room enough and was very noisy. It was cooler in the lobby than the room.Thank goodness we only stayed for one night. The staff was friendly. Hotel provided continental breakfast."
201,1778,"May 22 2007 	Shabby 	What a disappointment! This well located Midtown Manhattan Comfort Inn had a nice facade - clean lobby, breakfast area, nice computer room and small exercise room. But once off the lobby area it all went downhill fast.The room we stayed in on the 5th floor was very small and cramped. The TV armoir was so close to the beds and bathroom door it made manuvering around it at night a hazard. The standard mini coffee maker was located in the bathroom - above the toilet no less! Talk about an unappetizing and unsanitary place to be making coffee - by the john.The rug was so stained and soiled I wore my socks or shoes the entire time we were there.The bedspreads were worn to the point of being almost threadbare. The sheets were standard white, with the added bonus of a few ink or who knows what stains on them that had not come out in the wash.As I was in the manager's office complaining, I realized that her office was just as bad! The carpet was stained, her desk a mess and she offered no remedy or compensation. She did say that the upper floors of the hotel were undergoing renovations and that the 5th floor and below really needed it too.Other than the location and pleasant front desk staff, we were not pleased with this Comfort Inn. I would not recommend staying there.By the way, the cost of this room for one night, on a Monday mid May was well over 200 dollars."
202,1778,"May 13 2007	Quiet hotel at great location	A surprisingly quiet location just a block away from all the hustle and bustle of New York city. There was some initial misunderstanding on the room rates - I was quoted the AAA rate but when I arrived I was presented with the regular rate - but it was sorted out. Room size is decent for New York city, bathroom is clean. Be assured that you can get a good night of sleep here."
