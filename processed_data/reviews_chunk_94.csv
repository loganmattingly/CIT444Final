1,2009,Sep 28 2009 	Echo the previous review- bed bugs!	On my 2nd day there
2,2009,Sep 26 2009 	Bed Bugs!	The location and value are great
3,2009,Sep 10 2009 	Never again	Never again....People entered the room while we were out (they left lights on and moved things). They charged $10.00 more at check-in than the quoted room price. The TV didn't work until we fixed the cable. Fan was broken
4,2009,Aug 18 2009 	Pay for what you get	Good location. Walking distance to the wharf
5,2009,Aug 13 2009 	Great location but the rest is bad news - bloody sheets...yuck!	This hotel is in a great location. That's the only positive. I stayed two nights (room 212).On our departure morning
6,2009,Aug 6 2009 	Deposit required to activate room phone	Wanted to make collect call to family in Canada but was asked to pay a $20. deposit to activate our phone. Had never heard of anything so absurd. Deposit is required for local calls as well. Ended up going to the Marriot Hotel across the street to use the pay phone in their lobby to make a collect call to Canada.Also wish they had laundry facilities for guests.	
7,2009,Jul 29 2009 	the best location for the best price	Within walking distance is Fisherman's Wharf with tons of restaurants &amp; shops. Bourdin had good food and a great view but it was a little pricey. A short walk to Starbucks and Trader Joe's on Bay St. Columbus street had lots of places to eat as well. The Stinking Rose was amazing
8,2009,Mar 18 2009 	Great for the price!	This hotel is an older hotel
9,2009,Jul 16 2008 	Great value	1. cleaniness2. location3. priceWhile searching for a decent priced hotel in the Fishermans Wharf area
10,2009,Jun 24 2008 	Nice but could be better	We asked for a non-smoking room but got a room that was so stincky we couldn't even sleep. The guy at the reception told us that he cannot do anything because we checked in too late.The breakfast is nothing
11,2009,Dec 24 2007 	Never!!	Stayed here August 11-14
12,2009,Nov 15 2007 	not too bad but not great	My husband and I stayed in this hotel/motel for 2 nights the last week of October. We drove the california coast for our honeymoon without a map or reservations anywhere. Pulled into San Fran and started looking for hotel
13,2009,Sep 22 2007 	Don't Expect a great place	You get what you pay for and this place is a perfect example of it. This motel was okay and it was what i expected for the money. Directly across the street was a nice hotel but was 3 times the cost. If you want service
14,2009,Sep 16 2007	Shower at your own risk	My son booked this hotel the weekend of September 8 2007 thinking it was convenient for our itinerary. We checked in around 7 p.m. We discovered no place to park. We almost parked two blocks away in a public parking lot except my son watched for someone taking off from a spot on Columbus and thanks to cell phone
15,2009,Dec 9 2006	No Hot Water	Terrible terrible terrible!!! No hot water for showers
16,2009,Jul 24 2006 	Don't do it	Oh it was terrible. There are no words. Go elsewhere if you possibly can
17,2009,Mar 8 2006	You get what you pay for...	We stayed 2 nights at the travelodge fisherman's wharf in early March. I wanted to stay close to the wharf and I'd gotten a great deal thru Hotwire. The rooms were very basic hotel rooms. Everything was clean
18,2009,Feb 5 2006	basic but clean	We stayed at this hotel for 3nights
19,2009,Oct 13 2005	Don't waste your time or money!	What a major disappointment! The Travelodge at Fisherman's Wharf is a dump! Not even the special rate of $99 per night was worth staying. No air conditioning in room
20,2009,Oct 12 2005	Just what I needed - for budget-minded only	I moved to the Travelodge Fisherman's Wharf from a boutique hotel in the theatre district just to be in a safe and cheerful neighbourhood. The Travelodge was as simple as you'd expect - nothing fancy at all - but it was friendly and felt safe. I'd highly recommend bringing earplugs
21,2009,Aug 13 2005	Dreadful decor creaky floorboards you will need earplugs!	Great location
22,2009,Jul 1 2005 	Not too bad.	We just stayed here one night in June
23,2009,Nov 9 2004	Not worth the benefits of the location	Wow
24,2009,Jul 29 2004	Be careful!	Small rooms
25,2009,May 17 2004	Great Location.........that's all	Had heard good things about this motel and have stayed at other Travelodges so didn't hesitate to book. I wish that I hadn't. We got room 216 with two queen beds. The room is tiny (this includes the bathroom)
26,2009,Feb 23 2004	Not to bad at all	We enjoyed our stay here
27,2009,Dec 2 2003	Care Bear Look Alikes On Walls and Decor	Was close to SF Wharf but got the kiddy room for 1 adult and 1 teenager room was full of the the BearTravelodge guy ...on curtains..bedspread and chair...had coffee in room and lobby area where the front office slept.................one of the most interesting place with character in such a stranger city	
28,2009,Feb 13 2003	eeewwwww	Blech was right! the room we had was no bigger that our bedroom at home and this one had 2 beds and a table and a armour for the t.v. way small. No room to move. Had ants on the bathroom sink. water went cold when someone else from another room had a shower. the floor creaks. And then they charge you 10 bucks aday for parking and dollar a day to use a safe in the room even if you don't use it. Gouge Gouge. It would have been cheaper to park in a parkade all day. The only good thing about it that it was close to fishermans wharf (great place) Beware of the Camera/gift shop on Northpoint rd. It has the purple awnings
29,2009,Jan 15 2003	Blech!	I had the unfortunate experience of staying at this property on NYE. The only good thing about it is the location (close to the Wharf
30,2009,Oct 4 2009 	Ottima posizione		
1,2011,Apr 20 2009 	Disagree with all the negative reviews here!!	We booked the Beach Motel for no reason other than its price. We did minimum research and made the reservation before we read the reviews here. Saw all the negative reviews the day before we travelled and were horrified and thought of just going somewhere else but decided to go with it for one night as they already had our credit card details etc.Actually we were really pleasantly surprised. Yes
2,2011,Aug 9 2008 	Worst hotel I've ever stayed at in my life!!!	We &quot;accidentally&quot; booked this hotel thinking it was another one we had stayed at and BOY
3,2011,Jun 2 2008	horrible hotel + rude management - never ever stay here	Absolutely HORRIBLE place. Quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever stepped foot in. First as I parked I noticed there was only one available spot in the lot so not enough room for me and my friend to park our cars. I walk into the lobby and it smells old and dingy. Their website is also broken. I made a reservation for two people and two beds and it made it for one person and one bed. I walk into the lobby with 3 friends and the first thing the clerk says is he doesn't want that many people in the room. I explain to him that only two are spending the night. He finally agrees and checks me in. I get up to the room and then notice there is only 1 bed. It is also old
4,2011,May 17 2008 	would not stay there again if it was free!!!!!	My wife had a doctor appointment at UCSF medical center and I was having trouble finding a place with reasonable rates. I did not know it was graduation for UCSF and that the Bay to Breakers race was that weekend.the place was easy to get to from the north. There were no rooms available on the first floor and my wife has a bad hip
5,2011,Nov 4 2007 	Don't stay here!	I was looking for a place to stay while visiting my father
6,2011,Jul 25 2006 	Inexpensive and Ok If You're Not Fussy	I stayed here for a night during a bicycle trip down the California coast. it was about the cheapest lodging I could find that wasn't a youth hostel.If was OK. the room was a little funky
7,2011,Oct 4 2005	Nasty Hotel	It has a lingering ordor (not sure what it was)
8,2011,Aug 23 2005	what a nightmare!	this motel was recommended by SFSU for parents needing a place to stay when visiting their student. The cleanliness was OK
9,2011,Aug 9 2005	Inexpensive room free parking but steetcar noise	We stayed at the Beach Motel for four nights. The motel is in a residential neighborhood far
1,2014, and that would be exceptional value. I stayed here with my family a couple of weeks ago and I would have to say that this met and exceeded my expectations.It's a stylish hotel with retro decor and furniture; the staff are friendly and the hotel is extremely clean. There are good amenities available for guests such as: a bar
2,2014, ranging in age from 17 to 50
3,2014, very close by were lots of smack heads and drunks but have to say that they never seemed to bother any tourists and just kept to themselves but it was worrying walking past them. Also you didn't have to walk far out of the hotel and there were obviously unstable people around. Lots of social problems very apparent in San Fransisco.	
4,2014, and everything feels clean and new. Staff members were generally helpful. Downsides: The neighborhood isn't great
5,2014, which filled the room when opened out. Good tv with loads of channels to choose from.The location of the hotel is in the SoMa (South of Market) area of the city
6,2014, the team were more than helpful in providing a map and directions on where to go and what to do. The hotel has a cafeteria/restaurant custom burger. The place is always busy and we went there a few times for breakfast which was good although looking at the burgers when visiting for happy hour we were jealous
7,2014, funky rooms!! So close to union square
8,2014, (at least in San Francisco) deal with an annoying patron who was trying to nickel and dime everything
9,2014, rooms are small
10,2014, free jukebox in lobby
11,2014, and conveniences included an inviting roof-top (3rd floor) swimming pool. The decor was charming and non-institutional
12,2014, pretty central location...- ... although the neighbourhood is full of bums (though most leave you alone if you mind your own business
13,2014, or the Haight in a matter of minutes. Plenty of inexpensive dining options
14,2014, but this place literally charged my card double what I booked the room for. They did not fix it until after we checked out. This didn't really mess up our vacation
15,2014, too! This hotel has a courtyard setup
16,2014, but still safe. The only thing we didnt' like was breakfast in the restaurant - it was pretty crappy. Besides
17,2014, you can do the math. We had come on a fixed budget and this ruined our whole vacation. I understand mistakes happen
18,2014, but if you mind your own business they will probably do the same.The hotelrooms are nicely decorated and comfortable enough for a cityhotel. Good beds
19,2014, mid-century decor with a touch of deco and even a funky onsite hamburger joint called Custom Burger as well as an exercise room and outdoor pool.The good price is probably a product of location. The Ameritania IS a couple of blocks away from
20,2014, the staff seemed friendly enough and the rooms were clean. The beds were fairly comfortable
21,2014, however in October this proved adequate. We were only bothered by noise on one night and this only appeared to be due to a group deciding to chat over a cigarette in the outdoor courtyard  so I struggle to hold this against the hotel. The beds were very comfortable and the walk-in shower was great.The hotel restaurant looked good
22,2014, the first thing you would do is install air conditioning. They didn't here; they were more concerned with putting board game pieces in fat red frames.The hotel wasn't bad
23,2014, which is situated on 7th street
24,2014, and various other sorts of seedy people are everywhere. If you want to be near the adult superstore and nightclubs
25,2014, but nothing for the bedroom. We were unable to have a good nite sleep in 7 days.	
26,2014, the pool was clean
27,2014, this is a terrific place and we really enjoyed our time here.As of April
28,2014, we had absolutely no problems with anyone and one bloke even told us the best way to get to Pier 39 and gave us a heads up that we'd need exact change for the cable cars!Hotel staff were extremely helpful...we had LOADS of questions and they were very patient! Rooms were very comfortable
29,2014, myself and our 3 children (10
30,2014, before we checked in
31,2014, seems a little sketchy but
32,2014, have stayed at this hotel several more times with my family. Our last stay was in June and I have to revise my review based on the recent changes.The lady who was working explained that they were just bought out by another company. Usually
33,2014, it was a comfortable stay. Our family had one large two-room unit for 3 nights and we found the room to be both clean and comfortable. The maids did a good job of bringing our room to tip-top shape each day. The employees behind the desk were fine
34,2014, and car parking included in the room rate with plenty of spaces which was definitely a plus point. The hotel provided a shuttle bus to and from Union Square but we braved the walk and it was fine although I wouldnt fancy walking on my own. We used this hotel as a base for our sightseeing so we werent after an expensive luxury hotel just somewhere to stay the night which is what we got. For the price it was great and we would use this hotel again.	
35,2014, so I called down to the front desk. Apparently they are already aware there has been a robbery and tell me &quot;it's all ok now
36,2014, it was not. But it was a cheap hotel. And it was clean
37,2014, my room was very clean and quiet. The hotel staff was very helpfull. The next day I had a medical appointment
38,2014, it's a new policy&quot;
39,2014, I wasn't expecting much. Can't miss the motel - bold pink! The motel has a series of lovely courtyards
40,2014, 4 girlfriends and I spent 3 nights at the Best Western Americiana. I had never been to California
41,2014, and the great staff make it a great experience. I like the rooms and open courtyards
42,2014, but the shuttle is free
43,2014, the stay got much better. The rooms were a nice size and I liked the courtyard type setup. While the hotel itself felt safe
44,2014, buses and taxis. the area is sort of scary....but i sort of liked it. never felt fear even very late at night. the staff was great
45,2014, Expedia called and told me that they could not place me into the hotel I booked but instead offered Best Western Americania as an alternative. As I'm coming to SF for a convention and all other hotels are booked
46,2014, where parking alone would have cost 1/3 the price of my room at the Americania.) It's a very handy location for coming from SFO airport (just take 280 to 6th St and you're there). The neighborhood is a bit run down
47,2014, I required it to be within walking distance to the warf
48,2014, and a pleasant and helpful staff. The Pizza place had very good pizza and delivered to the room. Also
49,2014, and they didn't care about it.I had no sleep
50,2014, and so had no worries about booking the Americania. However
51,2014, but my girlfriend didn't feel all too secure as there were many drug addicts &amp; beggars in the area (esp. on and around Market St.). I guess that comes with the free and open-minded spirit of San Francisco (poor pals!!).My personal bottom line: Recommended hotel!	
52,2014, there is no problem.The only downside was the rudeness of the staff in the restaurant. Whilst a few of them were helpful
53,2014, right to union square.Soma pizza is good value accross the road
54,2014, after that I went to grab my clothes off the dresser only to watch as a roach scurried along the corner of the dresser to hide under my clothes! Truly a nightmare...and the manager pretended to call another hotel for us (also a Best Western in Santa Rosa). However
55,2014, but there's nothing to complain about. We took a family room that was spacious and clean. The decor was horribly tasteless but what do you expect in a motel and does this matter so much. The rooms are situated on an exterior corridor
56,2014, and the front of the room has large windows
57,2014, and the train stop is really close. The neighborhood was not great
58,2014, but we had no problems walking around the area at daylight.The hotel is OK. Nice rooms. They didn't get the internet working in my first room so I got an upgrade to a business room the next day. We didn't have any meals in the hotel
59,2014, basil to name a few. been panhandled more in san jose going to and from sharks games.	
60,2014, so I'm used to seeing that and it didn't bother me as much as it might bother someone from a smaller city. The room itself was OK
61,2014, clean. Very warm pool which is great even if the weather is cold. Not the best neighborhood
62,2014, but felt very safe. I would stay there again if I needed a place for the car and if my intent was to sightsee all day. Tip: Walk/ bike across the Golden Gate Bridge. I was more adventureous and continued walking into Sausilito
63,2014, a few blocks north is the tenderloin district which has lots of homeless and can be a bit pesky asking for money. Use the free shuttle to Union Square to avoid them. Shuttle runs at least every hour from early AM to around 11:00pm.Overall I have mixed feelings about this place. If you are on a budget
64,2014, I would never accuse this place of even being a HOTEL... It was more of a motor inn... It looked like it was falling apart and everything seemed dirty... In fact
65,2014, terrible area. Not a good one for families i would suggest. One good thing though if you do stay here go to SOMA pizza across the road. Great Pizza!	
66,2014, San Francisco was about 20oC when we were there
67,2014, but someone came and fixed it really quickly and we weren't even late in the end. So we were impressed with the service.Tony's Baloney round the corner is handy and great for breakfast. I would stay at the hotel again
68,2014, you are pretty far from most tourist attractions. All said it was not terrible but there are plenty of other hotels in the City that are far better. If you are a family with small children on a budget
69,2014, this Best Western Americania has nothing special about it. On top of that
70,2014, and the staff is friendly.I found the location pretty convenient
71,2014, staff friendly and helpful--- although when we returned around 3 A.M. the front desk clerk was asleep. We walked around the area
72,2014, for a very reasonable price of $135 + tax per night. We booked directly through the hotel (who will match offers you have seen on the internet but you do not have to pay in advance and can cancel up to 24 hours in advance - which is useful). We had a very positive experience of the hotel and would stay there again
73,2014, there is not enough space for all the guests cars. If you you are cheching out very early
1,2016,"Oct 23 2009 	My worst nightmare	This place looks nothing like the photo hosted on this website. When we pulled up we thought that maybe it was a mistake and then we looked at the address and this was in deed the place we booked. There were more than enough undesirable people hanging out in front if that was not enought to scare us, we checked in and right back out. I let the manager know that I would not be paying for this room and would be notifying my credit card company if they tried to charge me for the room. Let's just say that we were afraid we might take home a gift we did not expect if we had slept in the room."
2,2016,"Sep 29 2009 	Not So Much	The hotel was under construction, which I really dont see how they can fix this place unless they tore it down and started over. The bathroom was nice but the food area was gross, Osha would have shut them down. It was only one night but I should have spent the extra 20 bucks and found a better place. It did have free parking, but i didnt feel to safe leaving my car down there."
3,2016,"Sep 5 2009 	Don't make me laugh	August 23, 2009I recently spent four nights at the Best Western Civic Center/364 9th St/San Francisco, CA/94103.The experience would have been laughable if it hadn't been so expensive. It rivaled the best of Alfred Hitchcock's film noire genre. When my taxi arrived, I thought I had given the driver the wrong address. The venue was drowning in construction, which had not been mentioned on the Best Western website. In the room, there was a note on BW letterhead saying &quot;Please pardon our dust and noise from 10 AM-5PM weekdays.&quot; At the front desk, I knew I was in trouble when the clerk insisted I pay for all four days in advance. This made me surmise that the average guest stays only a few hours. The front desk clerk also had no change, no stamps, and sold me the wrong ticket when I bought a tour. The parking lot was filthy, the public areas grossly dirty, and the housekeeping schedule was sporadic at best. One morning, I left the housekeeping sign on the outside of my door and left for three hours. When I returned, housekeeping had not been there. I called the desk, was told that they were very busy, but that a housekeeper was immediately on the way to my room. I was in a deep sleep an hour later when the front desk called and asked me if I wanted my room cleaned NOW. The room itself featured a cracked light socket; the laundry-drying cord in the shower was missing. Also, for those seeking aerobic exercise, relish in the fact that there is no fitness center or elevator. You can hone your body isometrically by lugging your suitcases up and down a long staircase to and from the second floor.What motel nowadays has no air conditioning?--this one. An ineffective ceiling fan was the substitute. The ventilation in the room was non-existent. I suppose I could have opened a window, but I was reticent to do so because of the prostitutes and homeless striding through the parking lot. At least neither harassed me and will probably not harass you or your children as you walk to/from this motel. The single phone in the room was across the room from the bed. If someone in your family is sick and needs a prescription, there is no need to locate a pharmacy. Any drug is available on a multitude of street corners easily within walking distance of this motel. Bon Voyage!"
4,2016,"Aug 22 2009 	Not what I expected	I would say the bathroom was the only good part, it was clean. The room was small and dark, it smelled like cigarettes in the room even though we reserved a no smoking room. The front desk was rude and the parking is absolutely horrible. For the price I could have staid somewhere better in San Fran. The air conditioning only started at 70 and the fan stays on low. We slept on top of the covers the whole night. I would not recommend the hotel and I would never stay here again."
5,2016,"Jul 21 2009 	Great value for the price	Picked this hotel because of cheap rate and free parking. I was a little worried by some reviews but in the end I can only praise the management (and myself for picking this hotel). The car park perfectly fine, accessed at the back via an underpass. The swimming pool is impeccable and super clean (and very small). THe room was OK, the bathroom was well equipped, the breakfast is sufficient and all staff very friendly. Noisy, yes, it is in the middle of the city. No air con, yes, but SF places don't need aircon."
6,2016,"Jul 8 2009 	Not a nice place to stay.	I chose this motel mainly because the parking is free while most hotels in SF charge $25-$40 per night for parking. It is about 1.5-2 miles from Union Square where you can shop, eat and get on tour buses etc. As of July 2009 it's still under major construction outside. It's on a VERY NOISY street in dirty neighborhood full of homeless people. So if you are sensitive to noise you might want to stay somewhere else. There is NO AIR CONDITIONER in all rooms. It's very hot inside the room in July (&gt;80 degree) so I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone during the summer months. The price is good and so are the staffs. Wifi doesnt work in many rooms."
7,2016,"Jun 14 2009 	Good location 	My husband &amp; I stayed here for two nights. We got a great deal booking through Cotsco.com. When we arrived everything ran smoothly (sometimes online booking is a hassle) The guy at the front desk asked if we were familiar with this are and we said no, then he told us how there are gay clubs and that men would hit on my husband. (we only walked past the bars.. never saw anyone) We ended up in a handicap room (we aren't disabled) but it was nice because of the bigger room. Our room was one of the newly remolded one &amp; it looked very nice. and was clean. Our room had a table with two chairs, a flat screen TV, a fridge and space to store your luggage. There was construction workers that were working right outside or room.. but to be honest who comes to San francisco &amp; is in their hotel room from 10-5? We would be sightseeing and it would never bother us. There is a limited amount of parking space but if you get there and don't use your car for the trip you will be fine. The pool was closed, but we're big fans of swimming so it was fine. The breakfast in the morning was a lot better then I expected. Cereal, muffins, bagels, fruit, yogurt, apple &amp; orange juice, milk. The location was good, it did take a while to walk to fisherman's wharf.. but the hotel was very close to the BART &amp; buses. All in all we enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay here again."
8,2016,May 11 2009 	Nice Budget Hotel	Good Budget hotel. Walking distance from Moscone Center. Beds not too comfortable though...Good for business trips.
9,2016,"May 3 2009 	Beware MAJOR construction on entire property!	I stayed at this hotel in late April 2009 and I was not aware of the remodeling that is taking place on the hotel.It is happening on the outside of the building but it involves loud power tools and hammering from 10 am until 5 pm daily.They claim to be offering very discounted prices in return for the 'dust',but the prices are the same as always.I asked to upgrade and they gave me room 127, as it is somewhat soundproof.Happy Trails !"
10,2016,"Apr 8 2009 	not too safe	The location is pretty bad. Is quite a long walk to the attractions, we walked from fisherman wharf back, will take you close to an hour of walk. As you walk down, you can see the difference, the area went from high-class nice houses to dirty street, homeless and weird people on the street. I think they do not have a dryer, my husband walked out to find a lundry shop to do the clothes at night. There were actually people who ask him for penny etc... I do not recommend it if you are the timid type. There were even homeless hanging around the enterance of the hotel. The room were normal motel type, we had a drooling baby with us, and he is kind of dirty when he eats, so I could remember all the stains he made in the sheets. The 2nd day, we notice the bedsheet was not changed, on the 3rd we had to write a note &quot;pls change the sheets&quot; then we got fresh sheet. The best thing was the free parking if you don't want to pay those crazy price at other hotels, this was the main reason we choose this hotel. Overall, not for those fussy ones."
11,2016,"Jan 18 2009 	okay stay	I have stayed at this hotel two times, twice were okay, one was excellent. This last stay was just alright. The hotel is remodelling. The work crew worked right outside my room. For some reason, there was a musty odor in the room which got better after I aired out the room all day. I did not feel safe leaving the window open at night, however. The free parking was a big plus, and the hotel is near most of the SOMA action. The front desk was pleasant but somewhat slow. While I never felt unsafe walking in the area, there are some interesting characters on the street."
12,2016,"Dec 7 2008 	Some problems	Booked this based on location and a recommendation from a friend in San Francisco and took a cheaper booking option that prevented me cancelling the hotel.Was mortified to then read reviews on this site. Hotel not as bad as all reviews made out, but some substantial problems mostly- the noise. Motel is two levels, we were on the lower level. The roof is very thin - we could hear every noise and movement of the people upstairs from us, and boy were they active at night.- the traffic noise. 9th street is very busy. Could not leave windows open due to the street noise. Motel room had a ceiling fan but no air conditioning. Very stuffy.If you're going to stay here - stay upstairs and away from 9th street.But there were some good features, great king size bed, large room and friendly reception who helped with directions etc.Don't think the downtown location is as bad as some other reviews make out. We had no problems in the street."
13,2016,"Oct 16 2008 	Stay Away	Filthy, old, the area is a little bit scary.The room stinked cigarrette (eventhough it was supposed to be non-smoking). The breakfast was pathetic in equally pathetic minuscule lobby."
14,2016,"Sep 2 2008 	Not impressed	My husband and I stayed there one night in June.The hotel (well... I think they could call it motel) looked very dated.The room wasn't very clean (spiderwebs all behind the fridge and bed etc), the carpet was dirty. However the bathroom was very spaces with an excellent power-shower (looked new as well). The price included breakfast too :-) which was definitely the strangest hotel breakfast experience of my life (little plastic tables and chairs etc).They had a spacious parking lot which is a bonus in San Francisco."
15,2016,"Aug 3 2008 	Not someplace I'd recommend.	Booked this hotel via air miles since we wanted a place to stay downtown and didn't want to pay big $$ (the rate posted on Best Western was $379 so I figured it must be a nice hotel).Although the room was &quot;ok...&quot;, bathroom was dated and no A/C plus I would not recommend this hotel to anyone with kids due to the area. We had to walk about 5 blocks to get to the MUNI and found the streets we had to walk down a little sketchy along with some odd characters. Like someone else said, the parking is very tight and the front desk was not very friendly, almost rude. I won't be staying here again."
16,2016,"Jul 17 2008 	Okay Stay	We stayed here because it was on two blocks from a club we were going to. Considering accomodations in SF tend to be quite expensive this motel was a reasonable option.Location: we walked to restaurants and clubs (about two blocks) Civic Center (about three blocks), Union Square (about six blocks) and China Town (about nine blocks). Fairly safe neighborhood with lots of foot and street traffic. Traffic can be noisy early in the morning as 9th is a busy street. We used ear plugs the second night which helped considerably.Room: basic but clean; no air conditioning; we prefer open windows to AC but it was noisy with the window open due to traffic on 9th and the room; the room got quite warm but there is a ceiling fan which helped; bed was firm but comfortableCheck-in: when we arrived (about 6:00 pm on a Friday) there was a long line-up; the check in staff didn't seem to be concerned about the line-up and were joking around with each other while serving guests; not too professional but friendlyPool: we didn't use the pool but asked someone who had used how it was and they said it was coldBreakfast: available from 7:00 - 10:00; we ate about 9:30 so may have had a more limited selection then if we ate earlier; we prefer to eat healthy and were able to get some high fiber cereal and the last two pieces of fruite (bananas); there was only two kinds of juice, apple and cranberry; no orange juice; there was also pastries, boiled eggs, and instant hot cerealInternet: we used the computer located in the lobby; good internet access and nice size monitor; printer wasn't working"
17,2016,"Jul 2 2008 	One of the best deals in the area	This is one of the best managed hotels that I have stayed in. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The pool and grounds were very clean. The front desk staff is very good under the management of Tammy. All the employee's were professional. Their rates vary by time of year and events nearby. I have stayed at the motel many times and have not had any problems there. I would recommend this motel to my friends as a clean, comfortableand good value for San Francisco. Parking is free and for San Francisco that makes a even better value."
18,2016,"Jun 19 2008 	Stay far away from this one....	This hotel is not worthy of Best Western standards, and I am surprised that it is endorsed by Best Western....upon arrival and check-in we discovered that the parking area is VERY cramped and the rooms are not air-conditioned. Because of the seedy area of town this hotel is located, you can not even open the locked windows to get some air. The manager would only cancel our three night reservations for the subsequent nights forcing us to stay in a sweltering room for one night with no adjustment to the room rate. I intend to find every travel website I can to warn other travelers to stay away from this hotel. We rebooked the remainder of our reserved nights in San Francisco at the Best Western Grosvenor Airport Hotel, so you can see, we are not anit-Best Western...just VERY DISAPPOINTED in the San Francisco Civic Center location."
19,2016,"Jun 4 2008 	Good Value	Very reasonable hotel for the price. Not located in the centre of the city but easy access via bus stop next door. Helpful staff, computer for free internet and good basic breakfast. Not many hotels in the city area offer parking on site for free as here."
20,2016,"May 22 2008 	run down area	was surprised how rundown the area was, certainly we didnt see the loft conversions of the area..SoMa (south of market st ) is still full of loitering men &amp; not too pleasant a walk into the centre of San Francisco, but it was easy to find from the airport by car &amp; we had a lovely meal at the Triptych restaurant on Folsom Street, we had a nice room in a motel style, outside balcony with a breakfast buffet. We didnt use the pool as the weather didnt warrant it, but it is at the front of the hotel right on a busy street."
21,2016,"Apr 17 2008 	Best Western 9th Street is acceptable	Stayed here for the first time in mid-April. Arrived around 11am, in route to Giant's baseball game and checked in but was not assigned a room at that time. Was allowed to park with no problem. Front desk was always helpful and pleasant. Free parking is very tight, and as my truck is large, I opted for the back lot. Secure enclosed fenced area. It appears that the parking can max out, but I always found two or three empty slots, even when returning late at night. The non-smoking room was good. I found it very clean. Small refrig and microwave. The free breakfast was typical of most mid-level US chain hotels, rolls, juice, coffee, fruit. No hot pancakes or other self-grilled itemshere though. Yes, the cafe room is small but I did not find any crowding conflicts. The south of Market St and Civic Center area is on the edge of skid row. Many down and outers either lounging on the sidewalk or pan handling. Some are in transient hotels which dot the area beween this motor Inn and Market Street. None of them approached me other than an occasional, &quot;hey brother can you help me out.&quot; I do walk from the metro/Bart station late at night. Visitors should just use common sense The underground metro and the Bart train (they are different modes of transportation, share stations, but run on different underground levels) Civic Center station is four or five blocks north (step around any sleeping dudes) Very practical and cheap way to get around. You can take Bart from the airport(s) to Civic Center. City buses also run down Market (and everywhere else- get a map) to all the top rated tourist spots and upscale shopping areas. Powell Street. Senior fare on the metro (I are one) is 50cents per trip. Bart is slightly higher, charging by the distance. There are a couple of restored vintage classic street or 1930's?trolley cars that also run Market and around the waterfront ending up at Fisherman's Wharf on the north side of the city. (50cents for geezers) You will be amazed at the &quot;characters&quot; aboard- this is San Francisco of course. Way way more practical that the famed cable cars (expensive, long waits, and crowded) which run from Powell to the wharf. My single person motel rate this stay was $89 including taxes. I think this is a good price- again, this is San Francisco. My wife prefers another Best Western on 7th street, the Carriage Inn. $15 per night parking fee and a little more upscale, some with fireplaces insite. Breakfast is delivered to your room. Double rates there range from $140 up. Next door and also across the street (again 7th Street) are three other Best Western chain hotels/motels, with similar prices- and added parking fees. There is a free bus shuttle, on the half hour, in front of the Bestwest Americana Hotel, which takes you to slicko Union Square. No one checks you out, just get on it. I plan to stay at this motel- 9th Street-again, in a couple of weeks. FYI: The Giant's lost both games!"
22,2016,"Feb 29 2008 	Close to busses far from tourists	Stayed here during February with wonderfully temperatures in the 70's. This hotel has no air conditioning, but did have a ceiling fan which was useful since it was stuffy at night without the windows open. The free parking was a definite bonus here, as many other hotels charge ridiculous parking fees. We did not use the car during our stay in SF, instead taking public transportation with our City Pass. The bus stop is one block away or less. Very convenient! The staff is very helpful, printing boarding passes, giving directions on bus routes, etc.My kids loved the breakfast, but I found it lacking. One morning there were a few slightly overripe bananas, the next morning no fruit at all. The breakfast consisted of cold cereal, instant oatmeal, individually wrapped pastries, bread for toast, croissants and bagels. Overall, it was a decent inexpensive place to stay in the city, and I would stay there again, although as a tourist it would be more convenient to be closer to Embarcadero."
23,2016,"Feb 15 2008 	Inexpensive very nice staff.	We stayed at this Best Western for 5 days and had good experience. Although the front desk could not check us in early the man was nice enough to hold our bags so we could go sightseeing. We didn't really encounter any problems, except for the fact that we were put into a smoking room (we are non- smokers). They offered to move us to a new room the following night but we decided to stay since we had already unpacked. The room was small but cozy, and had a mini fridge and microwave which was really convenient. I always judge a hotel by the bathroom, and the bathroom was newly renovated and very nice. I read some earlier reviews on this hotel and alot of people complained of noise from the bar next door... but my room was right across from this bar and I heard absolutely nothing, it was very quiet. The complimentary breakfast was nice, everything was clean and the attendant was very friendly. We were very happy to see that they offered healthy foods as well: whole wheat toast, raisin bran, fresh fruit, skim milk, etc. I would say the only real problem I had was the neighborhood. The walk from BART was about 10 minutes and there are some scary people along the way. I did discover a shopping center about 2 blocks away with Trader Joes , Nordstom Rack, Bed Bath and Beyond, and Peets Coffee shop!!! Also, if your a tourist, as we were, the 47 bus is a block away and takes you to Fisherman's Wharf. Overall, we had a great time, the staff was very nice and helpful (they even gave us maps and directions). I would recommend this hotel, it's inexpensive and has free breakfast. Just don't expect 5 star accommodations, if that's what you want go spend $200/night somewhere else."
24,2016,"Jan 30 2008 	Inexpensive and comfortable enough	Off-season pricing was great (January). Room was clean, bathroom appeared to be fairly recently remodeled. Neighborhood didn't seem that bad, it was mostly warehouses and wholesale businesses. Other reviews have said you wouldn't want to go out walking at night, maybe so, but why would you anyway? There's nothing to see. The assumption here is that you have a car and will drive anywhere you need to go. Downtown is within walking distance, but it would not be a pleasant walk. Don't consider the breakfast buffet unless you are totally indiscriminate about what you eat. The room suffered from a heater that leaked heat even with the themostat off, so we needed to sleep with the windows open, but that was no big deal, they were still secure. No problems with parking. No pay-per-view movies, which would have been nice."
25,2016,"Jan 10 2008 	Great value for SF!	The 1King bedroom though fairly small, still provided great value for SF. BW website gave a rate of $54 + tax. There were no non-smoking rooms left (manager told us they go fast in this area) but the smoking room we got did not reek too terribly. The room had a ceiling fan that helped circulate the air. Parking is limited and the spaces are quite tight for large cars. The area looked a little dodgy at night and the signs in the parking lot to not leave possessions visible in the car made me a bit uneasy. Nonetheless, we never had a single person stop us and ask for money though we passed a few.This motel is within walking distance (but not terribly near) to Market Street Muni stop. Thats where we got our 1-day Muni passport ($11) that allowed unlimited rides on buses, trams and cable cars for the day. So it worked out to be a good base to explore the city. Bathrooms did not have a tub, but in its place a shower stall with a glass door. Both the bedroom and the bathroom were nicely designed, with the bathroom having a modern feel with dark gray tiles and pale green striped wallpaper. Microwave and fridge were also provided. Breakfast lady was on hand at all times to ensure items were well stocked- Muffins, bagels, bread, cereal, oatmeal, pastries, bananas and apples and juice/coffee/tea and hardboiled eggs upon request. It surprised us to see there were many guests at breakfast, as we did not hear any noise at night. For the value for money, Id definitely recommend this place. We wanted to extend our stay for an additional night and the manager was kind enough to point out the Best Western website offers a different rate than a walk-in. So we just went to our room, used the free wireless internet, and booked another night from [--] which turned out slightly cheaper (compared to front desk rate of $69)."
26,2016,"Jan 7 2008 	Avoid at all costs	We tried to stay at this hotel, but there general manager was so nasty and the rooms so poor that we immediately canceled our reservation, called on our cell phones, and stayed at the Holiday Inn a few blocks away.We were travelling with my special needs (severely mentally impaired) brother and sister and asked for adjoining or close rooms on the first floor. However, that's not what we got. Adrienne Emery insisted that we were stuck with the rooms she assigned us (which were on the second floor and about fifteen doors away from each other, down a corridor, around a corner, back down another corridor to the furthest room--closest to the street). When we checked out the condition of the rooms and found that they both stunk (one of them was supposed to be non-smoking), didn't contain the two double beds we were promised in our reservation, and that the general condition of the hotel made our skin crawl, she was downright indignant with us and told us she was still charging our credit card our full reservation (3 nights). American Express is still working this out with Best Western, but based on the way we were treated here and the condition of the hotel, we won't ever consider staying at a Best Western again!"
27,2016,"Dec 27 2007 	Best Value in SF	Got a AAA rate for $50 a night, total of $114 for 2 nights.Clean room, new bathroom. Blankets kind of old, and worn out, which is what I expect for this price, I used my own sleeping bag. Free Parking. Good Breakfast. Area is OK, not much going on on the streets around. Felt much safer than Market St, 2+ blocks from Union Sq."
28,2016,"Nov 22 2007 	Cheap	Went on a 3 week trip around the west coast of America. This was by far the worst Best Western in California! Other people must be staying in different hotels than the one I did. I am British and so have lesser standards when it comes to hotel amenities, but this was basic. I would compare it to a hostel. Yes it is the cheapest in the area, but when it gets dark, be prepared for a quick walk home in this neighbourhood."
29,2016,"Nov 12 2007 	Great Value in downtown	I arrived in San Francisco at 7AM from Asia and arrived at the best Western around 8:30 AM. I was told check in time was 2PM. and not many people had checked out yet. The front desk told me to get some breakfast. I got back to the lobby at 9:30 AM and I told her that I had been on a plane for 20 hours. She got me a room within 30 minutes. The room was on the small side, but very clean and well maintained. It included a refrigerator and micorwave and tons of cable stations. The breakfast was decent with cereal, oatmeal and bagels.The location is a little seedy, but I did not feel threatened. Worst thing a homeless person may ask you for money. But the value can't be beat. Parking is free, so you can leave the car and take public transportation."
30,2016,"Oct 1 2007 	Good place unsavoury area	The room itself was clean, spacious and well decorated. At times it was quite noisy because it is right beside 9th street however it was never bad enough to keep us awake. There was a fan in the room which kept the room cool enough, I don't think it really needed AirCon, (San Francisco isn't that warm!)The breakfast was simple; cereal, muffins, juice, coffee etc and is not in the reception but a special cafe.The staff were extremely helpful and anytime we needed assistance they were more than willing to help.The area wasn't the nicest in the city. The Civic Center has an infamous problem with homelessness which is disconcerting at first. However, it was the dark streets in the SoMo area and the dirty sidewalks which actually made it unpleasant. This however is a fault with the area, not the hotel.It is about 6 blocks from the BART and right beside some MUNI stops. It is the opposite end of San Francisco from Fisherman's Wharf and the Golden Gate but is very near Union Square and the Financial district."
31,2016,"Sep 29 2007 	Located in rough area	We stayed in the Best Western Civic Center Motor Inn from August 7th for three nights. We booked it based on the good reviews we read on trip advisor. The room was basic and and noise from traffic was loud when the windows were open, which was needed as there is no air-con.The parking is free and there is a contintental breakfast included. However the breakfast was served in the reception area which is small and so breakfast resembled a rugby scrum with everyone trying to get to their bagels &amp; muffins.The motel is located in a rough area and we didn't feel very safe walking in the area at night.If I had paid a cheaper rate I might have been more satisfied but $160 a night was poor value"
32,2016,"Sep 29 2007 	Good Value in San Fran	Free Parking, Reasonable Breakfast included. Great Price for location. Not a fancy part of town, but we walked to and from Giants Ballpark, and around area on Sat morning. Rooms are very basic, like an older motel but well looked after. Easy to get to off interstate. So if you need a place to sleep, park, and have breakfast this is a great place."
33,2016,"Aug 1 2007	Good and clean hotel	We just stayed at the hotel for 1 night. Me and my boyfriend arrived pretty late (after 2:00 am), but we could still check in very quickly. You have also a lot of parking spaces there. The room was clean and the breakfast was ok (donuts etc.). We also had free WiFi and the location is pretty good."
34,2016,"Jul 15 2007	Great value in SF!	I got a room with 2 beds for $65 total at this hotel. I thought it was an excellent value. The room was clean and appeared to be recently redecorated, my kids liked the pool, internet access in the room was great, and so was the free parking. I would definitely stay here again!"
35,2016,"Jul 4 2007 	Better than expected!!	Never have had been to San Francisco, we were unsure of where to stay. Since to us, any place was as good as the others, we looked at prices. We stayed for about $50, 3 adults and free parking. The hotel was excellent. We couldn't have asked for a better place for the money we spent. The rooms were clean, smelled good, and were decorated nicely. The bathroom was perfect too. The toilet actually flushed, and it flushed hard. That was a nice change. The only thing that wasnt so great is that they dont have AC. It got kinda stuffy in the room. But otherwise, its great. There is plenty of parking, the pool is heated, and everything works. I would stay here again regardless of the lenght of my stay. Try it, you'll love the hotel and the price!"
36,2016,"May 24 2007 	A Very Nice Place to Stay	This is a nice hotel in a great location for a very reasonable price. It is within easy walking distance of the gay leather bars and close to Market Street and public transportation. The room was a little cramped but very comfortable and surprisingly quiet for being right next to the pool and close to a very busy street; I especially liked that it had a minifridge, a coffeemaker and a microwave. Breakfast was small but good, served in a very small eating area in the check-in office; I loaded a plate each morning and took everything back to eat at the dinette table in my room. You MUST dine at least once at the Schnitzelhous, a terrific inexpensive German restaurant a couple of blocks up Ninth Street from the hotel, at the corner of Folsom."
37,2016,"May 23 2007	Brilliant Hotel	I was pretty wary about staying here after I'd read the other reviews on this website, but as soon as we got there, it went away. It is right in the centre of town, and after staying there for a week, I came to understand that everything South of Market Street, has a bad rep. I walked around at night (granted not by myself) and it was fine. There is a large homeless population in SF, but I never experience any problems.The hotel room was clean and roomy, the only problem for me was that it didn't have air conditioning, but other than that, everything was great, the staff, everything and it was good value for money compared with staying anywhere further up the bay."
38,2016,"Apr 27 2007 	We're so glad we stayed here!	We were a little worried about staying at this hotel because of poor reviews we had read online. But the price was so much cheaper than anything else in the area, that we decided to risk it. We needn't have worried! The location was fine--downtown SF is downtown SF. We never felt unsafe, even as we walked a mile to see a show late at night. The room with a 2nd sofabed was humongous! I've never had such a large hotel room without paying much more. It was perfectly clean, and the furnishings were very nice and elegant. There was a coffee maker, blow dryer, fridge, microwave, clock radio and internet access! The continental breakfast was great, the pool was beautiful, and the free parking was...well, free parking! The staff and other guests were extremely friendly and helpful.I would most definitely stay here again, and recommend it to all my friends."
39,2016,"Mar 7 2007 	Satisfied	I thouht this was a nice little motel. The room was bright and clean. The bathroom was new and had a nice hot shower. Front desk was very friendly, and very accommodating. It was convenient to have free parking - a rarity at many places in San Francisco. The TV worked well. The bed was comfortable. It was warm enough for us to sit by the pool and get some sun, which was great.I didn't think the neighborhood was bad at all. It's very convenient for bar-hopping. My only complaint was that there weren't too many restaurants in the area. This was a pretty inexpensive place, and I definitely felt like I got my money's worth. I would stay again, and recommend it to any travellers who are on a budget and aren't expecting a four-star hotel."
40,2016,"Feb 20 2007 	Affordable and clean -- in downtown San Francisco!	Pros: -Room was very clean; housekeeping was thorough -On-site free parking lot, a little tight but adequate -Continental breakfast was served each morning -TV got plenty of channels -In-room Internet access was available (but not used) -Close to freeway, gas station, fairly close to BART station -Price was reasonable for the hotel size/locationCons: -Construction noise; lots of pounding/sawing noise coming from adjacent rooms -Bathroom was a little small; shower handle was hard to figure out"
41,2016,"Dec 21 2006 	My fifth time at the Best Western Civic Center	I have stayed here five times, each time for 10 days, starting in 2002. The first year I had one of the small rooms in the back, but then I discovered that there are larger rooms with a queen size bed AND a sofa bed. I don't understand all the reviews about how bad the neighborhood is -- I walk to SOMA night spots alone almost every night and have never had any trouble. And as to being far from public transportation, three bus lines stop at Harrison and Ninth -- the 27 will take you to the Mission where it's an easy transfer to get to Castro Street and the 47 will take you to Market and Van Ness and then on to the Wharf. You can also transfer here to the Muni (underground) or the F Line or any of the Market Street buses. The rooms are very clean and very well equipped -- desk, table and chairs, sofa and coffee table, ironing board, etc. Refrigerator and microwave are a plus and Trader Joe's is just one long block away. There's also a good deli (the Diana Market) a block away on Ninth Street. Desk personnel have always been great and the free parking is terrific -- probably the only place in town that has it. I recommend the BWCC VERY highly and will stay here again this coming fall."
42,2016,"Nov 12 2006 	Great Value	This motel is located right in downtown San Francisco. I stayed there from Nov. 5 to Nov. 11 2006. It is one of the cheapest in the area but SUPER clean. I disagree with other reviews that claim it's in a bad area. As two women traveling alone we felt completely secure. If you are from a small town, traveling to a big city might be nerve racking in which case ALL areas in San Francisco will seem scary but this is definately NOT a bad area. San Francisco has a lot of homeless people and beggers. Everywhere you go you will see them from the glamourous stores on Market to the truly bad areas in Haight Ashbury.At this Best Western we were within walking distance to Mission Street and Market Street. We had a rental car, but did hop on the bus once to go to Fisherman's Wharf. (Bubba Gump restaurant is great there.) You can easily access the public transportation from hotel or walk to Mission and catch the trolley. The staff was very friendly and all were able to give good directions and recommend various places. They have a washer and dryer available which is very nice. (Who wants to come home with dirty clothes?) We went to all of the big stores on Market Street. The manager of the motel reccomended outlet stores in Vacaville which were GREAT! Our room was the closest to 9th street which is busy like all streets in San Francisco, we left our windows open all night and had no problem sleeping. We are not heavy sleepers but the soundproofing there is good. When we were in the room we usually left the door open (we are from NY so it seemed hot to us, although the locals were wearing winter coats!) The property is fenced in and has free parking. Try finding that somewhere else in San Francisco!This is a lovely property, with great staff and a heated pool! Definately a great value in a very overpriced area. Thank you to Bali and the rest of the staff for making our stay in San Francisco a lot of fun.On Misson street (take a left off of 9th) there is a cosmotolgy school where they have haircuts for $5. It was the best $5 I EVER spent. There is also great shopping on the less touristy areas of the Mission district."
43,2016,"Nov 4 2006 	Dangerous area at night!	We stayed here for a week in October and the location is awful! The area is renowned for a homeless/drug/crime problems and you can't walk outside at night. That said, the hotel was OK for one of the cheaper ones- very clean and has all the basics you need. If you do go here you must have a car if you want to travel out in the evening or be prepared to pay for taxis. Better still get a hotel around Fishermans Wharf, Cowhill, Russian Hill or Nob Hill areas. Whatever you do don't go past 5th Street after 6pm (nothing to see there anyway)"
44,2016,"Oct 8 2006 	hotel ok worst part of town	For the price, the hotel itself was acceptable. That's where the positives end. This hotel is in the worst part of town. I've traveled all over the world and I have never been so scared about walking to/from my hotel. I was afraid to go out at night! The hotel is near homeless people, drug junkies, addiction clinics, liquor stores, adult video stores, etc. It's a good 6+ blocks any direction to reach public transit...and those are blocks that you want to walk through VERY quickly. The street it's on (9th) is also quite busy all through the night...I had to stuff toilet paper in my ears because the traffic noise level was so high that I couldn't fall asleep otherwise.Unless it's your last resort ( it was mine) and you value your life, find a hotel in a better area."
45,2016,"Oct 6 2006 	Cheap block of rooms that are clean and spacious in blah neighborhood	This hotel is an oasis in an gritty part of the city, but it is safe for walking in the daytime. I could not get a better rate for a block of 7 rooms for 4 nighs. In the evenings, frankly, you should take the F line streetcar ($1.50 takes you anywhere along the warves...look for the one that reminds you of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine...) or taxi in case you don't enjoy encounters with panhandlers asking for handouts. Across the street at one corner you find &quot;STUD&quot;, a bar where I don't think my wife would visit, and at the other end you have the AIDS healthcare thrift shop.And there is a nice, inexpensive Indian restaurant around the corner, and interesting pub with fien beers up the steet, and the ubiquitous Starbucks at a corner gas station (a big station).Moscone Center is 18-20 mins walk away. 5 mins in taxi after waiting 5-8 mins for taxi. No complaints on housekeeping or management at desk. If you stay, try to be as distant as you can from the street and its noise. And the free parking is secure."
46,2016,"Sep 7 2006	Hairrison Street Fair	Traveling with a large group is never an easy task, but the staff at the Best Western Civic Center Inn made every effort to make our stay as pleasant as possible. From providing us with a list of nearby restaurants to dine at or being prompt in supplying extra towels or even calling taxis, Valy, the desk clerk, was as accommodating as one could be for a group of 100 rambunctious and wily partiers. We came to San Francisco to attend the Hairrison Street fair over Labor Day weekend and the organization, Bears, put on a great event for us. The Best Western was the host hotel for this fair. Valy was the best and I will be staying here again for next years Hairrison Street fair."
47,2016,"Sep 6 2006	It delivers	Finding a reasonably priced and clean room in San Francisco isnt always easy to do. Based on prior experiences, many places seem to advertise one way and yet offer a completely different product. Luckily, this time, my dealings with staying in a hotel in SF proved to be more fruitful. Looking for a reasonably priced room, I booked at the Civic Center Best Western Inn. It advertised clean rooms, free breakfast, free parking, free wireless internet, fridge in the room, and pool. It delivered. I now have a solid hotel to depend on when visiting San Francisco."
48,2016,"Aug 22 2006	Clean rooms free parking and a pool	It has a pool, and its heated! The Civic Center Inn Best Western immediately caught my attention, because, lets face it, not too many hotels in San Francisco have a pool. But this was only one of several positive features that this Inn had to offer. The free parking was a definite plus, as was the continental breakfast in the lobby and the guest laundry. Although this hotel is in the quieter area of the South of Market, that turned out to be a positive. After long days of walking and touring the city by public transportation, which isnt all that bad if you ask the front desk for some help, it felt good to return to a comfortable bed in a quiet part of the city for some rest. On that note, the rooms were clean, nice, and filled with all the expected amenities of the Best Western brand. The Civic Center Inn was everything I was looking for, probably even more, at a great price. You cant go wrong by staying here!"
49,2016,"Jul 28 2006 	Bad neighbourhood and bad staff	First of all a dreadful neigberhood. We did not feel very comfortable walking around the streets or even sleeping in our room. We were supposed to stay there for 4 nights, but moved uptown the day after. We booked the hotel we noticed that the property had a pool  but it was closed during our stay due to mainteanance. Not very well planned in the middle of the summer. We came fairly late in the evening and the night staff in the reception could not answer many questions we had about the hotel, the pool and how to register our frequent hotel card. He was not very service minded or eager to help or answer our questions. The room was nice, clean and spacious enough for us travelling with 2 kids."

1,2018,Nov 25 2009 	Good value for money	Not the ritziest place you'll every stay but practical if your'e on a budget like we were.The rooms are nice and clean. Mini bar was well stocked and the location was good for our needs.Stafe were super friendly and i overall enjoyed my stay
2,2018,"Nov 21 2009 	Home away from home	Well, not exactly, we don't actually live in a huge antique mansion, but the staff certainly made us feel &quot;at home&quot;! We went on our 10th anniversary trip to see something different, and boy did we ever! I've never used an elevator that featured an old-fashioned clang when you push your destination button, and on our 5th floor, there was a hallway door that we needed to push to get out of the elevator! So Cool! The room was beautiful, with large windows and a super view up and down Geary. What a comfy bed! The cleaning staff was friendly and did a great job every day. The front desk staff was great too -- Nancy welcomed us with a free tequila shooter upon our arrival, and Duane gave us great advice on which transit buses to take to get to various sites in the city... he told us all about a great internet service to help us look up departure times of buses, etc. Really nice! And I think the best part was the 5-6 pm wine &amp; cheese thrown in as part of our stay. We met so many great people just sitting around for that hour in the big comfy leather chairs in the lobby. Great location -- we walked most places, and explored Haight Ashbury and GG Bridge by muni. Just the best time ever, and our stay at this hotel was perfect! Would absolutely recommend and we'd go back in a heartbeat!"
3,2018,"Nov 9 2009 	Great Hotel- lovely room good location	The Hotel California was for us a great find- the rooms are beautifully decorated; nice and light, and the service, which includes drinks and cheese at 5pm everyday, and very friendly staff, was excellent. It's in a great location- just a few blocks from Union Square and you can pretty much walk everywhere in the city from here, although to get to Golden Gate Bridge and Castro we took the bus. There is a gym in the hotel, as well as internet on 2 computers (although they probably need to add a few more as these were always busy) and there is a popular restaurant. Breakfast isn't bad but if you want the full American breakfast you'd have to go out to one of the cafes close by. Overall experience was really good and we would definitely go back there."
4,2018,"Oct 20 2009 	Terrible !	This Hotel is the worst hotel I have ever stayed ! The staff does not care if you are checking in or not , they just don`t mind at all , the front desk is really old , the furniture is old and seem that has not been clean for ages, the floor in the main entrance was dirty , and stayed dirty all the days I stayed there, the elevator brooke on the first day and was not repaired. And all the Hotel has a strange smell. There are a lot of nice hotels around this one , so avoid it if you can."
5,2018,"Oct 19 2009 	Tried so hard to like this place	I really tried hard to like this place. I got a great deal on the room and like to boast about my bargains, I'm just not sure this was one of them. First of all the front desk staff (accept the overnight guy) were great very helpful. Tony the supervisor seemed a bit &quot;spaced out&quot;. After I mentioned the pipes made a rumbling noise he actually said, &quot;I'm not sure what to tell you&quot;, YIKES. Not the response you want to hear at that moment. He gave much better responses on other occasions though. Things it has going for it are the art around the hotel, rooms are uniquely decorated and unlike some reviews suggest the location was great. Yes it's close to the Tenderloin but so are many highly rated hotels like the Hilton and Niko to name a few.So, on my list of things that went wrong1-Elevator broke on my third of forth day there. Luckily I was able to move from the 6th to the 2nd floor.2-First room I changed to on the second floor had no shelf in the bathroom to sit shampoo, soap, brushes, etc.. The windows were stuck closed and as I mentioned earlier the pipes made a loud rumbling noise.3-In the second room on the second floor; we had a flood at 4am after using the bathroom. I found a plunger in a hallway closet and with the help of our towels we controlled the flood. When I went to the front desk to ask for help or at least more towels the front desk person said no one was available until 7am and he did not have any more towels, WOW. He did at least give me access to another room to get towels out of there.4-The lounge area is nice but it is not cleaned often and fruit flies constantly fly around you. They also need at least 2 more computers available to guest. The 2 they have (one in the lounge and one at the front desk) are simply not enough.5-The work out room is a bit of a joke. The equipment is not well-maintained and only 1 treadmill and 1 elliptical machine.The wife was not too happy with this place. All and all I would not recommend this hotel unless you were on a very very very slim budget and even then there may be better options."
6,2018,"Oct 8 2009 	A Charming Vintage Hotel in Downtown San Francisco	We recently spent five days in The City by the Bay, and we were absolutely enchanted by our accommodations! The Hotel California is an older hotel just blocks from Union Square, and has maintained the elegance of its former days while updating itself in key matters. Our room was high-ceilinged, with ceiling fan and tall bay windows, and the staff had thoughtfully provided bathrobes for our use. There is an exercise room available, and wireless internet in the rooms (although it was fairly slow whenever I used my laptop). The decor is charming, with quotes about San Francisco and California painted on the walls in the lobby and above the crown moulding in our room. The staff is exemplary; everyone at the front desk was so helpful, giving us tips on restaurants and things to do, as well as walking-distance attractions. There is a very good restaurant/bar attached to the hotel, and they offer a free wine and cheese every evening from 5 to 6 pm. We had breakfast included in our room rate, which was a very good value, as otherwise it is $7.00 per person.The hotel's location is excellent, as it is right on one of the bus routes, and only 4 blocks away from the Powell/4th Street Cable Car terminus, where you can purchase MUNI tickets for 1, 3, or 7 days (a GREAT value!). If you haven't read this tip already: USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN THE CITY. Do NOTdrive your own car. Traffic is a nightmare, and parking is a migraine headache! We took the CalTrain to The City from the airport ($7.00 per person), and then paid $8.00 for a cab ride to the hotel. It was worth every penny!!"
7,2018,Oct 8 2009 	Great spot lots of character	This hotel made our trip to San Fran a most memorable experience we would saty there again in a heart beat its is most unique and great value Its a real find and would highly recommend this hotel
8,2018,"Oct 8 2009 	Good value good charm not luxury	Overall, a recommendation. Old building, so no AC, and a little musty smell in the hallway upstairs. Old antique elevator, which is cool, but slow and a little scary for anyone not completely comfortable on an elevator anyway!Room is small but cozy, clean, bright, and with a nice charm. Location is good, close to major transportation lines (BART and F Line, as well as many MUNI busses), major mall, Union square, chinatown is walkable. However, downtown in a big city (one of the most concentrated populations in the nation, next to Manhattan) and the street will be noisy. I recommend an upper floor for less noise.Restaurant in the lobby is an amazing Vegan place. Even if you're not Vegan, check it out (I'm not)."
9,2018,"Oct 3 2009 	Our room rates were over priced	Good Location for touring, Very noisy location especially at night on the Fire Department run and the bar on the corner open very late and noisy. We stayed for 8 nights and the first night was an outrageous price, and next two better but still too high and the last 5 nights were reasonable. Tried to have rate adjusted by the General Manager as we were staying 8 nights, no word yet. Tony, Armando and Ricky and the younger late night Fellow were really great people, management is so lucky to have them. They made our stay. Thank you guys. Gal on the morning shift not as friendly, needs to smile more but very professional in her job.Room. Deluxe Sunroom, small, but very bright, comfy bed, awful pillows, hot, no air and you can't leave the windows open for the noise. Bathroom, very dated, peeling sink cracked tiles and no towel bar near the sink, small but serviceable. Small towels but very white and soft. No safety deposit box in room, we had to use one in the lobby, not so convenient but okay. Had to ask for a coffee pot but again that was okay as they brought one for us to use and each day we were given coffee. Wood floors nice but very noisy. Some people don't realize how noisy they are when they walk with shoes on. Maid was cleaning upstairs room at 7.30am moving furniture the first night we stayed, not happy camper, especially knowing the price we paid. Nice to have access to a computer but very very slow. Lobby needs to be fixed up. Very, very old and soiled chairs and out dated lamps. Happy hour was a nice touch. The cheese was always gone the first 15 minutes but the wine was plentiful and not bad. It was nice to chat with people from all over the world . People are friendly and this helped having the happy hour for all to enjoy.Would we go back. No Would we recommend it. NoReason, too high priced, too noisy, needs some more renovating, small rooms but clean. There are so many hotels in San Francisco to choose from, go for the 4* you won't be disappointed."
10,2018,"Sep 24 2009 	Not up to Best Western standards	Central, city location, but very noisy and scary after dark. The room was very small and had sticky stuff on the floor. No ice machine, had to go to the front desk to get ice. Towels were small and limited. When I asked for an additional towel, I noticed it was laced with pubic hair. I nearly vomited. Wine and cheese in the evening was nice, but unlike other Best Western hotels, you had to pay for your continental breakfast. Front desk personnel were obviously bored. Parking was $29 a night. Loved the bellman though. He was extremely helpful and courteous."
11,2018,"Sep 23 2009 	dump. Dump. DUMP!!!!!!!	This hotel is a dump! Before you ignore this review, please be advised that I am a student with a small budget -- I am used to staying in the likes of Holiday Inn's, Comfort Inn's, and even the occasional Best Western. I have always had pleasant experiences in those hotels because they are as basic as can get. I am not a hotel snob by any means -- I was just looking to have a pleasant stay in San Francisco.This hotel is garbage. From the moment we pulled up to the dilapidated building I knew what we were in store for. The front desk clerk was sitting there with his legs up on the front desk reading a sports magazine. Ok, I get it -- working the front desk is boring, but walking in and seeing the bottom of someones dirty sneakers was uncalled for. As we piled onto the elevator we noticed a strange odor which got worse as soon as the elevator doors opened to our floor. Ahh yes, the sixth floor - the smelliest floor of them all. How do I know, you ask? Because the rest of my family and friends were on different levels. The hotel smells like urine, plain and simple. The carpets are years old, as judged by the faded color and caked on dirt.The room was smaller than normal. THERE WAS NO AIR CONDITIONING!! We had no towels, our television was broken, there was the smell of urine in the air, and the linens were dirty. Went down to the front desk to change rooms, and they insisted they would bring towels up, as well as fix the television and the linens. About 2 hours later an employee came up with 4 washcloth sized towels and he fussed around with the television, but couldn't fix it. We demanded to switch rooms. Our new room was much smaller than the first, but thankfully the bed seemed clean and the television worked.To make a long story short, I would never ever recommend this hotel to anybody. The hotel walls are paper thin. Did I mention I could hear the couple in the room next to us fighting? Our room was located directly across from the elevator, which made sleeping impossible as people were coming and going all night. The brochure photos make this hotel look like The Plaza, well guess what? Seems to me they use a bit of trick photography to lure you in. It looks NOTHING like the brochure. There is also a sketchy tobacco shop right across the street where the local homeless people like to hang out and beg. Just what you want to look at when peering out your hotel room window, right?DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!"
12,2018,"Sep 1 2009 	San Francisco and ""The Duane Tour""	San Frnacisco is the most fabulous city ever! We started our stay at 3 a.m. with Duane at The Hotel California and that led to a great trip. He suggested a myriad things for us to do in between our Outside Lands music festival and we were never disappointed! Brenda's for breakfast was a delicious beginning and the MUNI pass made each day an adventure! We can't wait to come back and take &quot;The Duane Tour&quot; part 2!!!"
13,2018,"Aug 26 2009 	Great Location and Value	We had a 2 room suite with a bath in between - nicely decorated and clean rooms, Pergo floors, whimsical decor. Very quiet at night, no AC but heat and fans. Comfy beds. Bathroom was dated (peeling re-coated sink, bit of plaster flaking in shower) but everything functioned. Best part - location, 580 Geary, walking distance to Financial District, Powell Cablecar terminal, Market Stret, Chinatown and Union Square. $200 a night for 4 adults and a teenager on a cot - can't beat it!"
14,2018,"Aug 26 2009 	People in charge of public business should be prepared for it	The hotel is simple, clean but very lacking of good services. Breakfast is lacking.The worse thing is that at our arrival the over fourties man that received us at the desk was extremely impatient and very irritating. He even talked very bad about the next door parking service which was actually good . We choose the next door parking because it was much cheeper thank the hotel one, how can that be possible??? and we wanted no longer to talk to this man. If you work for people you have to be ready for it and be kind, or at least, be correct."
15,2018,"Aug 25 2009 	Been there three times and returning a fourth	First stayed when it was called The Hotel Savoy. Am returning for what will be the fourth time. Love San Francisco. Traveled there frequently on business and need a fix every year or two. Location can't be beat, rooms are fine, wine reception is a plus and rates are fair."
16,2018,"Aug 25 2009 	Most comfortable bed ever	My husband and I travelled to SF with another couple last week. We all really enjoyed the Hotel California which is close to shopping, tourist attractions, transportation, theatre, dining, and anything else you could possibly want or need. The hotel is very European and the beds are comfortable, maid service is excellent and very friendly, and the decor is tasteful. We loved the hardwood floors and quotes on the walls. There is lots to see and do in SF and transportation is relatively cheap. If anything, I would dismiss the hotel's dining recommendations and try out the Pacific Cafe at 7000 Geary Boulevard (at 34th Avenue, a $15 cab ride) or anywhere in Little Italy where late night dining/beverage options abound (we ate at Steps of Rome and Michelangelo's, a $10 cab ride). Both of these restaurants offered complimentary wine while we waited for a table. In the morning, make sure you go around the block from the hotel for breakfast crepes at Honey Honey. We went to see Wicked at the Orpheum Theatre and would highly recommend it."
17,2018,"Aug 24 2009 	Very cool place to stay in San Francisco.	We stayed 5 nights in this hotel &amp; loved the location, clean room, comfortable bed &amp; helpfull staff. We were on the 7th floor and were not bothered at all by noise, except when the windows were open &amp; you get the street noise. We enjoyed the shot of tequila when we checked in and the complimentary wine &amp; cheese in the afternoons. We would definately stay here again."
18,2018,"Aug 18 2009 	Great Customer Service and Affordable Room in a Central Location	First of all if you happen to be checking in when Duane is working you are in luck! He is the most helpful, and friendly hotel employee I have encountered in any of my travels in both the US and overseas. He will give you the &quot;Duane Tour&quot; which will walk you through all of the attractions and how to get there if you do not have a car. Even housekeeping staff was excellent never pushy, even when we repeatedly slept in and forgot to put the sign on the door. All of his restaurant recommendations were on point and give a taste of the real SF not just the tourist trap places you would wind up at other wise. Rooms are cozy and the beds are incredibly comfortable. It is the small touches (i.e. tequila shot at check in and wine and cheese hour) and friendly staff that make it feel like a boutique hotel with character rather than a large chain."
19,2018,"Aug 15 2009 	Wonderful people and atmosphere!	My husband &amp; I spent 6 nights at this hotel and loved it. The staff were very helpful and informative (Tony and Duane were great!); the location was close to so much shopping and several points of interest; the room was very clean and well laid out; the place was filled with character. There is a small grocer and a Walgreens just down the block, which we frequented to keep the room's fridge filled with snacks and drinks.On the downside, the area of town is a bit noisy due to several clubs/ bars in the vicinity and the rooms don't have air conditioners (which would block out some of that noise.) But if you are someone who likes the nightlife, this hotel puts you in the heart of it at a reasonable rate. We would definitely choose this hotel again."
20,2018,"Aug 11 2009 	I loved this hotel!!	The staff was friendly. The rooms were small but bright and really clean. The decor was fun and the beds were comfortable. The window actually opened. It was great during the day, but better closed at night because of street noise. The location was great. If you're not into fancy hotels with fancy prices and want something with some character at a reasonable cost, this is the place. We would definately return."
21,2018,"Aug 7 2009 	Perfect Hotel	This hotel is perfect for your stay in San Francisco. Its clean, friendly and serves an excellent breakfast with lots of choice. Our room was very clean, bright and airy, we could actually open the windows and you cant often do so in San Fran hotels. We also had a window in the bathroom. The beds were very comfy and we had a large closet. Maid service was excellent too. Our only downfall was we couldnt use the bathtub as there was a problem with the plug. We had to use taps as our shower!!!Staff very friendly and helpful. Two minutes from Union Square and very nearby to all the sights. Tenderloin being directly opposite.Great place to stay anytime!!Would definately stay here again."
22,2018,"Aug 6 2009 	Best hotel of our 2 week holiday	A lovely light and airy room and though not massive it was easily big enough as a double. The wooden floors were lovely and definitely felt cleaner than some of the carpeted ones in other hotels. The decor was lovelyand clean and the bed comfy with lovely cotton sheets. The location is great, just 3 blocks from union square and the outside noise was limited. The plumbing was a bit noisy at times but this wasn't a problem at all for us. The building itself is lovely with character and some great quirky decorations. The desk staff weren't over friendly but were efficient in their role. The free wine and cheese was an unexpected bonus and although the cheese and biscuits were limited, it's free so who cares! The internet was reliable and the rooms were well cleaned each day. There was a later than usual check out time of 12pm which was great asit meant less rushing. There are loads of hotels in and around this area but for the price we paid we were both really impressed with the room and the location."
23,2018,"Aug 6 2009 	Best Night Clerk	If you stay at this hotel, try to either check in late or just stop by the front desk between 11 and 7AM. Monday- Thursday. The front desk guy Duane rules the town. He knows everything about SF and he is happy to share this information. The&quot;duane tour&quot; involves taking the express busses to see the town on the MUNI system. This is a cheap and neat tour of the city. Do not miss out on this guy and his helpful information."
24,2018,"Jul 27 2009 	You can do better in San Francisco	What we appreciated most about The Hotel California is that the room was clean. We had a very small room with wood floors, which are well swept, so you never had to walk on gross carpet. The bathroom was also very well cleaned. The biggest problem was the noise. It is an old hotel and there was, a loud rumbling sound that make the frames on the wall vibrate. We arent sure if it was the elevator or water heater but the noise went on well after midnight and then started again early the next morning. Another problem was the wine they offered in the lobby at 5:00 was not served until after 5:20, and it was with saltines and cheep cheese. It was a mystery wine served without a label. There are so many interesting hotels in San Francisco this one is not worth your time."
25,2018,"Jul 26 2009 	Full of character!	We had a very enjoyable stay at the Hotel Californiait all started with a complimentary &quot;welcome shot&quot; of tequila! The front-desk staff were very helpful and offered lots of suggestions and advice. This place is full of characterCalifornia-inspired song lyrics on the lobby wall, funky art, vegetarian restaurantand didn't feel like it was part of a chain at all. The location was greatclose to great shopping, sight-seeing, transit, and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again."
26,2018,"Jul 15 2009 	Great location	I liked the location, which put me within walking distance of everything from MOMA in the south to Fisherman's Wharf in the north. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was clean and well furnished with a very comfortable bed. My only complaint was that my room was facing Geary and the street noise was apparent. I slept with ear plugs and was able to obtain a great night's sleep in spite of the street noise."
27,2018,"Jul 12 2009 	noisy very very noisy	hotel was quite nice, arty and quaint in a good location for exploring the city.. BUT.. it was so noisy you can hear everything: the elevator, people going in and out of rooms, traffic noise, nightclub noise you name it, you will hear it!"
28,2018,"Jun 17 2009 	Great value!	We loved this hotel - great location just off Union Square. The decor and ambiance are charming, the staff are very helpful and the room prices are very good value. We particularly enjoyed our &quot;parlour&quot; suite."
29,2018,"Jun 6 2009 	Not a luxury hotel but it was perfect for a quick getaway.	We decided to stay at the last minute and called the Best Western 800 number. The guy on the phone stayed on the phone until we got there and checked the place out before we paid for the room. I was a little worried about it being a dump because of the price. I was very impressed by the quality for the price. It was very quaint, clean and cozy. It was and old building but it just added to it's charm. The room was a little small but it was perfect for us not to mention the complementry shot of tequila we received upon arival."
30,2018,"May 31 2009 	Good Character for a Good Price	As mentioned in the other reviews, we booked a suite and was told they did not have any available upon our arrival. However, they made up for it by giving us three queen rooms on the top floor. So needless to say, we were satisfied. We did get the free tequils shot when we checked in, but we did have to ask for it.The rooms were decorated with different California themes. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. In the three rooms we had, there was no mold. One of the rooms had a corner view with great views of the city.They have a happy hour with cheese and crackers and house wine which is FREE, so I don't understand the complaints about it on the prior reviews. There is a cool little lounge on the second floor with internet access and a vegetarian restaurant downstairs.The only complaint was the parking. It was expensive and the valet took FOREVER to get our car to us.Overall, I fairly enjoyed this place and will stay again the next time I come to San Francisco."
31,2018,May 30 2009 	Great service location and value.	We were attending a wedding with family members from all over the U.S. and everyone loved this hotel for it's location and terrific staff. The hotel is located within a few blocks from Union Square with world class stores and steps away from transportation to the entire Bay area. The staff is friendly and rooms are clean and decorated with style. The two meeting rooms are great for a casual gathering or a small business meeting. The tequila shot upon check in sets the mood for your entire stay. Everyone was pleased with the number and the variety of restaurants located with the block (especially Dottie's for breakfast around the corner).
32,2018,"May 27 2009 	Lots of charm and near so much. A great budget find!	I have to echo the many people who like the quirky renovation this hotel has undergone. The standard room is smallish, but big enough for two careful people. Yellow paint and high ceilings, and a hardwood floor give it a little more spacious feel. Bed, bedding and furniture are of good quality and the bathroom was nicely finished. I'd sometimes use the stairs and always beat the very slow elevator. I didn't eat there or use the exercise facilities, so I can't comment on those, but the wi-fi worked fine. I had an inside room and noise wasn't a huge issue but I could imagine it would be for the street side rooms. I got an unbelievable rate through Priceline for mid-week. They give it 2 1/2 stars (about right) and it's in the west Union Square area."
33,2018,"May 27 2009 	We went here for an anniversery	We were on a budget and just wanted to get out of the desert for our anniversery, we stayed at this hotel and they gave us this awesome room on the corner of the building. All of the front desk staff was great! The hotel was really in a good location we took the public transportation from the airport and then walked a little ways and we were at the hotel. They had these little doors in the hallways that i do not think we were supposed to go into but it was an old stairwell that was really narrow and steep really cool for pictures. The room we were in had hardwood floors and awesome city views, if you are not used to being in a city with large buildings all around you. It was fun to watch people and easy to get to all the stuff we wanted to see. There was a dinner place there on property but we didn't eat there. I liked the feel of this hotel and would stay again."
34,2018,"May 22 2009 	Decent for the price	Not a terribly nice hotel, but it's good for the price. Rooms are a bit old, with kinda weird decoration. Bed's aren't terribly comfortable, and the bathrooms aren't that great. But, if you're looking for a cheap room in SF, not a bad choice."
35,2018,"May 20 2009 	A step back in time	Staying at this hotel is like stepping back into another time. It's an old, lovely hotel reminiscent of hotels in New York City. The rooms are small, but typical of hotels built so many years ago. We loved everything about the place. Visitors not accustomed to city noises might have to adjust. The emergency vehicle sirens and the voices from the colorful &quot;locals&quot; down on the street will carry up to the rooms. If you can handle that you will enjoy your stay. Our room was clean, the bath towels were plentiful and thick, and the bed was comfortable. We drove to the city so parking was expensive. We paid $55 for two nights in the lot next to the hotel. We took a cab, bus or walked to wherever we wanted to go. The hotel is a decent walk from Union Station, mostly uphill. We really enjoyed our visit to the hotel and to San Francisco."
36,2018,"May 19 2009 	Tiny but reasonable pleasant place to stay	Good Hotel, clean, good service, great free internet. Rooms are tiny basically just a bed - but a few different lounge areas you can utilise in teh hotel. Great value for San Fran where everything else seems so expensive. A little noisey, especially at night lots of sirens etc..."
37,2018,"May 9 2009 	Great value great location	We spent three nights here and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We caught the Bart from the airport but we (well, I) made the mistake of walking us (2 women) up from the 'Civic' Bart station right through Tenderloin at 11pm at night - a little scarry for us but we were not approached or threatened in any way. The 'Powell' Bart station on Market Street is actually closer and a better area to walk through. The hotel is just a few blocks up from Union Square. There is a laundromat just across the road and up a little. The afternoon wine and cheese is a nice touch. Avoid the continental breakfast, it's a disaster AND we were warned, a shame really as we stayed at 5 BW's on our trip and it was the only breakfast we had to pay for and the poorest quality. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful, especially Dwayne. Our room was 'compact' but very comfortable, especially the bed.A must is to try 'Millenium', the vegetarian restaurant downstairs. I'm an unashamed carnivore but my partner is vegetarian and this was manna from heaven for her. The food was truly wonderful and well crafted. It's not cheap but worth every cent and the service was top notch. Had we stayed another night we would have gone back.We look forward to staying at the Hotel California on our next trip to SF."
38,2018,"May 4 2009 	This is not as expensive as some SF hotels but very good value for money	We thought all hotels in SF seemed very expensive so booked a Best Western that seemed ok, but we were quite nervous about this average looking 3 star hotel. But all our worries were for nothing. The hotel is very old, the lift seemed 100 years old, but the hotel has oodles of old charm. The room we had was indeed small, but super charming. Colour scheme delightful, and decoration very nice. The bathroom was again very small, but this is SF where supposedly everything is small or expensive. At least it was all clean. Its a short walk to Union Square, where I recommend going to Macys and having lunch or dinner at The Cheesecake factory. You must have at least two portions of the to die for cheesecake, mmm. The Fishermans wharf area is relatively quick and easy to get to from here, so no real need to pay the extra money to stay there. Union square area is super especially if you wanna do some shopping. We were very happy with this hotel. And must also insist that you visit Alcatraz, which was the highlight on the whole California/ Vegas trip. But book before you go, and book the 9.30 morning trip to avoid crowds."
39,2018,"Apr 12 2009 	Exceeded my meager expectations......	We had done a lot of research before choosing the Hotel California. I had heard a lot of horror stories about some of the older hotels being smelly, tiny, loud etc..... I had visions of needing constant air freshener and ear plugs. It really wasn't bad. The rooms were definitely small, but not as bad as expected.  The TV was ENORMOUS, but didn't get reception of any kind. We didn't care because we weren't in San Francisco to watch TV. It's just nice to catch the news as you're winding down.  The bathroom was very small ( to be expected) but it was clean. That's all I ask.  There is no air conditioning so if you're planning a summer trip, this would be a consideration. We were there in December so it wasn't an issue for us. The windows do open, but I wouldn't call the air out there &quot;fresh&quot;.  The noise off the street at night is actually quite loud. We were on the 6th floor and our room faced Geary Street. There was no end of sirens and traffic, but that's to be expected in any city.  You aren't but a few blocks off the &quot;Tenderloin&quot; district in this area and so you do get a lot of homeless people milling about. This was mostly from around noon on into the night. It's a minor annoyance. We never felt threatened in any way.  I will say that the halls did smell a little musty and closed up, but hey, it's an old hotel.  The staff left a bit to be desired. They weren't helpful when asking for directions or information. Other than that, they were friendly enough.....just not helpful. Not that it was a big deal, but we weren't offered our free shot of Tequila either.  So, all in all it was a decent stay. There is so much to see in San Francisco that we spent such a tiny amount of time in our room anyway. We literally spent from midnight until 7am in our room to sleep and shower. By the time we got back to the hotel at night we were so exhausted that the noise didn't bother us at all. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The price was right and the location was good. PS. I don't recommend renting a car. Public transit is everywhere and you walk a ton too. Parking is out of this world........ Unless you really must, don't bring a vehicle into the city or rent one."
40,2018,"Feb 23 2009 	Charming and tasteful	We booked our stay at this hotel from the Hotels.com website and got a great deal. Considering how expensive the rest of the city is, knowing how little we paid (roughly US$82/night inclusive of taxes) made it that much more enjoyable.Don't expect to see a big Best Western sign when looking for the hotel. We had to circle around a few times after getting confused with the one-way streets and not being able to see it the first time around. At the suggestion of another reviewer, we parked in the neighbouring garage and paid $29 a day, which was $30 less than if we had valet parked with the hotel. It was pretty hassel-free, just expensive.While the hotel is on a main road and close to the sights, it's near the sketchy section of Taylor and doesn't feel totally safe sometimes. The number of homeless people and policemen actually surprised us. It wasn't really an area I'd feel comfortable wandering around in.The hotel is charming and doesn't feel like any generic Best Western hotel. The lobby is tastefully decorated and always felt busy. The rooms are small but had everything we needed. You'd likely go stir-crazy if you had to spend a whole day in there, but it was just right for an evening of TV watching. With the queen size bed, they still managed to squeeze in a desk, sitting chair, ottoman, closet and full bathroom.Our room was located right next to the elevator, and if we were ever to return, we'd request a room further away. The doors aren't very sound proof and the old-school elevator makes a loud dinging sound each time it arrives at the floor. We mostly took the stairs to avoid waiting for it. And like any old building, the floors aren't sound-proof either so we often heard the neighbours above us walking around.Good points: great price, clean, well-decorated, plush towels, in-room safety deposit box, friendly and helpful front desk staff, complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning and wine and cheese in the afternoons.Not so good points: sketchy area, not very soundproof rooms, small rooms."
41,2018,"Feb 19 2009 	Great Place for Low Price	We stayed here while we visited Alcatraz and The Castro. It was right between the two and the price was right. We could easily walk to Chinatown and had a lot of food options. The city noise was a little loud at night but for the money this hotel is great!!! The $30 valet was pretty cheap too, compared to other parts of the city, and the service was great. I would recommend this hotel for its proximity to Dottie's Restaurant too!"
42,2018,Feb 13 2009 	Enjoy and Relax	Husband and I came for the weekend...we are local and just came to spend the weekend in the City...We have stayed in quite a few places in San Francisco over our many years but really had the best time here...very relaxed atmosphere. The staff were so friendly and attentive. The room we had was very comfortable. and enjoyed the decor. We parked around the corner overnight for $20 which is very cheap for San Francisco. This hotel is close to so much stuff..you can walk all over the place. Cable cars a few blocks away and tons of shopping. It is smaller than the other bigger chain hotels but I think that made it nicer...they have a afternoon wine/cheese thing and coffee in the morning with restaurant connected. You do hear some street noise like sirens if going down the street but I have heard that at the other big places....that is San Francisco.. I do and have already recommend this place to my friends...Come and enjoy.
43,2018,"Feb 1 2009 	Not bad - Great price and location!	I am a teacher, and I booked The Hotel California through our teacher's union and received an outstanding rate - I think it was around $100/night, if I remember correctly! Anyway, after reading the reviews and finding that price, I thought it was worth a shot. I was coming from PA to run the Nike Women's Marathon, so all I really wanted was a place to sleep.We arrived pretty late at night, but we were assisted immediately - the front desk clerk was kind and gave us many suggestions for breakfast the next morning. Our room was small, but decent - it was pretty clean, but I thought the floors could have been washed, as my socks were dirty after walking around with no shoes on. However, the bed was SO COZY - after our long flight and late arrival, it won us over immediately! Location - it was DEFINITELY located in a GREAT place! Right in the heart of everything (Union Square) and access to all of the popular destinations (the cable cars/trollys, buses to take you everywhere, etc). We bought a pass in Union Square that allowed us unlimited use of all transportation in SF, which was so great. We utilized the bus system and saved so much money - not to mention it was a great way to see the city.If we went back to SF, we'd consider staying at the Hotel California again - it is a decent place to sleep when traveling on a budget."
44,2018,"Dec 7 2008 	Great Best Western	All of the hotel staff were outstanding! Very hlepful and friendly. Hotel is very centrally located to everything.You get what you pay for at this hotel; It's older &amp; noisy (due to being in a big city), but clean and what you would expcet for the money."
45,2018,Nov 2 2008 	nice and clean good rate	Very positive experience. Hotel is located in the center of SF so do expect some noise.Rooms were clean and very nicely decorated. Staff pleasant and helpful. I would recommend it. Parking is just next door $25 overnight. Breakfast was the greatest disappointment and not worth $7.00 they charge.
46,2018,"Oct 22 2008	Great Hotel - Loved it!	Great place to stay. My sister recommended it to us and I've recommended it to friends (who have now stayed there more than once!) Centrally located, great room and we met some great people at the wine and cheese social time in the lobby."
47,2018,"Oct 2 2008 	There has to be a better place to stay that costs ~ $150/night.	No parking, no remote or TV reception, cracks in the bathroom floor, and toilet plumbing issues - yikes! They gave me a $30 discount, but it was not enough. We had 2 different hotel staff people in our bathroom for a half hour in the morning dealing with plumbing issues. I won't stay here again."
48,2018,"Sep 28 2008	Not a good experience.	Having read other reviews of this hotel, I want to repeat the warnings others have posted. To sumarise our experience: On booking in we were told our pre-booked suite was not ready but booked as requested. A double double on a high floor. Our bags were stored and when we returned later the suite wasn't available anymore. We had to settle for a double and two singles on a lower floor. This meant my six-foot high son squashed into a single bed and his luggage had the other one. He tried the games but stopped when he realised it was an additional charge.The bathroom had a hole in the ceiling and mould as extra decoration. It smelt musty.Lightbulbs were out but there was an abundance of mouthwash. Weird. The noise throughout the night was awful and I resorted to earplugs. Looking back it was the battle to get the room which remains worst. This was not a relaxing experience. Try elsewhere if you can unless you are prepared to stand and negotiate/ argue with the reception.There are better hotels - we found one."
49,2018,"Sep 25 2008 	Never Again	Check in and out went smooth, but that's about all. No water pressure and drains that don't. Wi-fi connection was between 1-3 bars on the 4th floor. Resulted in very poor speeds and one night no connection at all. Reported to front desk and they gave me a 1-800 number to call. Reported a problem with the shower and it took two days to fix. The street noise was bad. The emergency vehicle sirens kept you awake most of the night and the mass transit noise ensured you did not need an alarm clock in the morning. From a hotel charging $300 plus per night, we expected better."
50,2018,"Sep 7 2008 	Favorite Hotel EVER!	This hotel was amazing! I had been in San Fran for a conference the previous week and extended my stay for a vacation. For the conference, I stayed at a big name hotel across from the Ferry Building that costs two or three times as much, and was possibly my least favorite hotel experience ever.Walking into the HC was like walking into an oasis! I was really surprised that it had so much character since it's part of a major chain -- it was really more of a boutique hotel. Chris at the front desk was incredibly nice and helpful. He greeted me by name each time I saw him, and asked how my day had been. Thanks Chris!I stayed in a junior single (no desk), and it was perfect! Plantation shutters, adorable quilt, comfy bed, flat screen t.v., ceiling fan (!), roomy bathroom, great decor (real, non-hotel-style furniture was a nice touch). Coming back to my room at night felt like coming home.There's free wireless internet in the rooms, and there's a computer station for guests as well. Great location -- near Union Square and Chinatown. Also in the Indi-Pak area, so great, cheap restaurant choices. Besides Millenium (the veg restaurant attached to the hotel), Golden Era (all vegan chinese) is only 2 blocks away, is much more affordable, and is incredibly delicious!I have told all of my friends and family to stay there when they travel to SF, and I'm much more likely to stay at a Best Western because of my experience at HC,"
51,2018,"Aug 20 2008 	Awesome Hotel!!	This was the cutest little hotel! The rooms were so nice, decorated perfectly, and were so clean! We were worried about the area a few blocks down, but you can definitely walk to a lot of places from this hotel. The room had a large flat screen, comfy bed, and was just so cozy. My boyfriend and I were very impressed! Absolutely would stay here again. Great place."
52,2018,"Aug 19 2008 	Sorry...we've overbooked! Go somewhere else!	Another married couple along with my wife and I traveled across the US to visit San Fransisco. Of course flying across the country, we had called 2 days in advance to confirm our reservations at the &quot;Hotel California&quot;. After 8 hours of flying and a 20 minute van ride we finally arrived at the hotel to find that they had overbooked our 2 bedroom suite and all other rooms and could not guarantee us a room for any of our 4 nights we were staying. The hotel's best offer was to shack us all up in a single room with double beds in a hotel where the rates were $150 more per night. The only offer the &quot;Hotel California&quot; made was that they would pay for the 1st night there. They would not budge on their downgrade of an offer which would cost us more money and jam the four travelers in a small hotel room. After 2 hours of standing, waiting, arguing, standing, waiting, and arguing, .... in the main lobby they suddenly had a 2 bedroom suite open up at their hotel. I guess the finally decided to bump someone else because they may be less trouble to deal with. I truly recommend to avoid this hotel at all costs. The manager was no where to be found and requests to talk to him on the phone were declined. Besides these two hours of &quot;Chapter 1&quot; in &quot;Hotel NO NO's&quot; we weren't bothered the rest of our stay. However after their first impression on us all, we didn't expect much."
53,2018,"Aug 18 2008 	Hotel very very noice	Althought the hotel room where nice, the noice of fire engines going out all the time throught the night, kept me and fellow friends awake all night, If you want to be able to sleep at night don;t book here. where there 2 nights, slept about 4 hours in total."
54,2018,"Aug 17 2008 	Probably Not Again	This hotel isn't horrible, but it isn't great either. The pictures are a little deceiving. Although they apparently have remodeled recently it seems as though they scrimped on the details. From afar it looks nice, but up close it's pretty shabby. For example, the crown molding isn't repaired just painted over, where tile meets wood flooring it looks like a 2 year old did it, where they have touched up paint they actually used different colors, the carpet is worn and the floors seem sketchy. The rooms aren't huge, but not entirely small either. I will say that we had a room on the 7th floor, which I thought was going to be great. But the windows are so paper thin, and the hotel is in such a busy area it litterally sounded like we were sleeping in the street. I'm not very proficient in busy cities, the sirens and trash trucks, (they pick up trash EVERY day) seemed like they were going ALL night long. The walls are so thin, you can actually hear the tv in the next room. It was my honeymood and arrived early and they would not let us check in early and we were not met with the promised &quot;frosty shot of tequilla.&quot; The area is good location wise, walking distance to China Town/Warf/Shopping but it is full of homeless people who are relentless in asking for change. Now for the positives.... They offer a breakfast for $7 and it's really good and the best price you'll get. Toast, bagels, cereals, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, sweets, rolled lunch meat and orange/pinneapple/grapefruit juices along with coffee and tea. We weren't ever at the hotel at 4:00 for the wine and cheese reception, another couple did say it was nice. And, they have what has been called the best vegan restaurant in San Fran. Wish I had more positive input, but I just dont."
55,2018,"Jul 31 2008 	Loved Hotel California	We almost always stay at Best Western and have been pleased. Hotel California exceeded all expectations! We had a lovely time, the location is perfect and, of course, San Francisco is a lively town. Hotel California was within convenient walking distance to everything we wanted to experience and the afternoon complimentary wine, cheese and fruit topped off perfect days!"
56,2018,"Jul 24 2008 	Sweet place	I thought this was a great place. We were in SF for a conference in July 2007. At the time the taxi driver took us first to the wrong place, the California Hotel which is about 6 blocks further down Geary (and scary!). We were relieved to make it to this beautiful place--bright, yellow, welcoming. The taxi driver said &quot;oh, the old Savoy Hotel&quot;. Don't know what it's rep was back then. Also, it's apparently now a Best Western hotel, but I don't think it was when we were there. In any event, we loved it. Very european feel to it, and clearly very recently remodeled (so maybe it used to have a bad rap). Cute yellow rooms with quotes from songs stenciled into the ceiling molding. Very small room, don't get me wrong, but it's a big city right and you can't have everything? Small but really well furnished. The bed was great, and there was a comfy pleather chair. The bathroom was very nice, and pretty well sized. Because it's SF in the summer we had to open up those double-hung windows to let the glorious 58 degree air in while we slept--BUT, that made it pretty noisy (and we weren't even facing the street). We found out later that there's a major hospital about 20 blocks west on Geary, so all the ambulances coming from the Union Square area zoom past the hotel with sirens blazing. But seriously that was not a big deal. Plus, there's tons of stuff nearby, you're only about 3 blocks from Union Square, can't beat that. Oh, and the wine and cheese thing in the afternoon was really nice, we just sat in the small lobby and met some really interesting people (one guy from Australia, and some locals from Napa or someplace waiting to eat at the apparently well regarded (4 star or something) vegan restaurant adjacent to the lobby)."
57,2018,"Jul 22 2008 	Had a great stay and trip	I recently traveled to San Francisco with two of my friends for a weekend trip. We stayed in The Hotel California and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. The rooms weren't excessively large, but they were adequate considering that you don't really spend much time in a hotel room anyway. Two of the gentlemen at the front desk, Duane and Tony, were both extremely helpful. They were both incredibly friendly and on several occasions helped us find different locations around town that we were interested in, giving us what turned out to be good advice.The wine and cheese in the afternoons was a nice touch, as was the complimentary shot of tequila.Overall, our stay at the hotel was very pleasant."
58,2018,"Jun 30 2008	Pretty good	The room was very nice, albeit a bit small (San Francisco after all). Very clean and interestingly decorated. The rest of the hotel, though, seemed a bit neglected -- in need of a bit of sprucing up--we had been in the hotel last year (not to stay but to eat at the adjoining restaurant-- which is a gem--The Millenium--a vegetarian restaurant)--and the place seemed to have gone downhill a bit since then. On the other hand, the price was right and the room was good. Management needs to take the plywood off the elevator door and fix it up--it really looks bad."
59,2018,"May 28 2008 	Horrible! This hotel Smells of Pee!	Reading the other reviews I wonder if I am talking about the right place - I am, I checked. I stayed here May 14-17 and hated this hotel. The whole place smelled of pee - it made you gag when you walked in! And if it smells like that then it can't be clean surely? There was a heat wave when me and my husband were visiting and the rooms are horribly hot with no air con. We could not open the window as the kitchen fan or something similar was right outside on a flat roof and this sounded like a train driving into the room so we just had to sweat! The elevator was not working for over 24 hours when we arrived so we had to carry our own bags up the stairs to our room - not easy as I had a broken arm so could only use one arm.They advertise a cocktail on arrival - we got none. There is a wine and cheese thing every day in reception which would be great if you like sweaty cheese and warm wine.This hotel is horrible and I wish we had stayed somewhere else. Avoid it if you can."
60,2018,"May 18 2008	Not what we'd hoped.	Having read reviews on this site I chose this hotel carefully. I was aware of noise at night and the lack of sound-proofing, so requested a 'high' floor and a double, double suite. On arrival we were assured this would be ready in a little while. We left our bags and went to explore the city. On our return the rooms had been allocated to other guests. We had to accept a lower level suite, which also meant that one of us had to sleep in a single bed with a spare one for the bags. Lucky bags, unlucky 'six-footer'.The Reception had obviously caved in under pressure from other guests (who we met later- and they had complained, so got the upgrade!).Unfortunately, the 'night -music' I'd read about, did wake me at 3am and after a while I found my earplugs and I got sleep. The windows were overlooked (about 12ft away) from offices, so the wooden blinds stayed down even in daylight hours, keeping out light but not draughts.The bathroom wreaked of mould, looking up the black patches were huge and obvious. The whole bathroom was well overdue for renovation. I suppose you could say it was in keeping with the style of the hotel - small and needing a 'shake-up'.The Breakfast was a strictly vegetarian choice, so not even an egg in sight.The Millenium Restaurant was exceptionally busy and even with a reservation we had to wait for our table. Service was excellent.The menu firmly revolved around beans and every kind of pea imaginable. The plates were a sea of green and beige. Deserts were fabulous, maybe we should have skipped the main course and had two or three deserts. In summary, an expensive meal, but a stylish and good-vibe restaurant.My advice is, if you are Vegan or strict vegetarian then this is a venue for you. For others... look elsewhere for a more comfortable stay. As a footnote, the next day I recognised the 'music' which had kept me awake at night... a homeless man stood outside the hotel with a white cassette player. Maybe not homeless, he lives in the space between the hotel and the office block below the bedroom windows!"
61,2018,"May 12 2008	Love this hotel!	Don't let the name &quot;Best Western&quot; fool you- this is a old-fashioned, unique hotel.I really love this hotel- it is a great location, only blocks from Union Square. You can walk to shopping &amp; dining - there is a lot to do in the vincinity, so you don't necessarily need a vehicle.The rates are reasonable (around $120 / night) and it is a quaint, old-fashioned hotel. The staff is friendly and accommodating.The best part is complimentary wine &amp; cheese from 4p-6p ... what a nice treat!The worst part is the street noise- it can wake you up early in the AM.I will always stay at this hotel when I am in San Fran- I really enjoy it's uniqueness."
62,2018,"May 3 2008 	Beautiful and Clean	We stayed here in Jan '08 for MacWorld. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The Lobby shares the same sitting area with the attached restaurant, so sitting in the lounge chairs in the evening is difficult. The had wine and cheese with crackers and fruit every evening.The room was small, but beautifully decorated and had wifi! The room safes were big enough for an iBook, a MacBook Pro and various ipods, etc. It used a 4-digit code that you set when you first use it. The bathroom had a shower/tub combo and plenty of room on the counter or under the sink for our toiletries.When booking, we looked at the hotel's website to get info, but booked through hotels.com. The official website basically said all rooms had a mini fridge. not true. I called immediately after getting to our room and they said only certain rooms had mini fridges (ie Deluxe Queen, we had standard queen.) They said that they would provide ice directly to the room, and they did 24 hours a day. We bought a large styrofoam cooler from a small grocery store that was a block away (back towards Market on the same side of Geary street.) for $3.The elevator and hallways were decent, but less than perfect. Mostly because guests that would leave stuff out in the hallway, but it was always cleaned up later.The hotel offers a discounted breakfast buffet for the attached restaurant, but we, everyday, walked 2 blocks toward Market and ate at the Pinecrest. Best breakfast by far.The Wifi was nice, and they offer a PC for guests to use and they have a small workout room.Overall, we were very satisfied."
63,2018,"Apr 24 2008 	Very nice	Found this hotel by accident and really lucked out. Warm, inviting rooms with a strong Cali-european ambience. Super comfortable beds, helpful staff, delicious vegetarian restaurant and access to many attractions and public transportation make this a hidden gem- a true find. Most attractive of all is the affordability of price in the heart of San Francisco. Free wireless internet was a huge bonus."
64,2018,"Apr 17 2008 	Welcoming hotel	Stayed here with my partner and teenage son for 4 nights. Hotel looks shabby from outside and the immediate area is not particularly nice but inside is very pleasant and staff extremely helpful and welcoming.We had a suite on the second floor-2 rooms and a bathroom. My son's room faced the main street and he found it very noisy but our room at the back was quiet.Plus points-good access to Union Square and other amenities, pleasant helpful staff, complimentary wine and cheese in comfortable lounge area from 4-6 each evening, good breakfast-cereal, fresh fruit, eggs, pastries, juices, coffee and tea-suite quite spacious.Downside-our room hot and window difficult to open. Immediate area not very pleasant with lots of homeless loitering outside. Having said that, they didnt hassle us in any way ."
65,2018,"Apr 15 2008 	Had a great stay at the Hotel California	We loved this hotel for its character and personality, as well as the amenities and the service. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The complimentary wine and cheese receptions were a highlight, with California wine! We also had free round-the-clock coffee and hot tea. There's a great lobby with huge comfortable chairs, and a media room at the mezzanine level with additional seating, a computer, and a printer, where I was able to print our boarding passes. Another guest computer is available at the front desk. The free high-speed wireless was wonderful. (I always resent having to pay $10 a day or so for wireless access at pricier hotels.) From the music in the lobby to the pictures on the walls, the decor set the mood: very vintage San Francisco, with curving, carpeted stairways, high ceilings, and hardwood floors, with a definite European feel. The hotel was built in 1906 but underwent a major refurb a year ago. Our yellow room with blue and white bedding was not large, but adequate. The safe in the closet, big enough to hold a laptop, was no extra charge. The bed was more comfortable than those in pricier SF hotels. We also had a flat-screen TV. The shower had great water pressure and no shortage of hot water. We stayed seven nights and could not have been more pleased with this hotel. The hotel has a great restaurant (the place was hopping on Saturday night), and there are many others nearby. The location was terrific for us. This hotel was the best bargain we've ever had in San Francisco."
66,2018,"Mar 4 2008 	Not what I was expecting	I wasn't &quot;forced&quot; to book this hotel, but it was the location where the conference I had enrolled in was, so I went ahead and booked it without doing my usual &quot;due diligence&quot; in shopping for the &quot;right&quot; hotel. My plan was to book a nice room and have my family meet me at the end of the week, since it was advertised as close to &quot;Union Square&quot; in San Francisco. When the cab dropped me off out front, and as I was struggling with my suitcase, I was surprised to not even have anybody open the door for me - even though, it appeared someone from the hotel was standing out front. Nonetheless, I went ahead and made it in and checked in at the front desk.The person at the desk welcomed me and gave me some &quot;basic&quot; information about the hotel. He said that there was a nice breakfast in the morning's in the hotels attached restaurant for $7 per person. I was excited to hear this, as I was traveling on a limited per diem. First of all - don't let the websites pictures fool you about what the rooms look like. Yes - they are nice with hardwood floors, flat panel television, etc... unfortunately, however, the pictures must have been taken with a HUGE wide-angle lens. My &quot;Deluxe&quot; room that I paid extra for was extremely small! On the bright side, I was pleased to see that I had a coffee maker in the room.The first night sleep was very good - the bed was extremely comfortable. I was ready to start the day by brewing some coffee and head down for breakfast at the restaurant. When I showed up downstairs, there was a tray of danishes and croissants and some coffee. I asked about the breakfast and was told that the restaurant was having technical difficulties and would not open until the next day. Needless to say, the restaurant did not open once for breakfast for the rest of my stay.Another thing to be warned about - the homeless people in this neighborhood are abundant!!! I'm used to seeing panhandlers and beggars, but the extent that these people go to is very disturbing - and they are getting away with it!! I know all big cities have their issues with homeless people, but San Francisco seems to be ignoring the issue and just letting them continue with their aggressive begging behaviors is very sad. On my third night I heard what sounded like gunshots coming from the immediate neighborhood and some yelling associated with the sounds. I don't know if they were gunshots, but they were pretty distinctive in their sound. There was also, what sounded like, some cars drag racing outside my window on one night, making it very difficult to sleep. I finally had enough of the neighborhood and small room and decided to check with a very upscale hotel down the street to see if they had any rooms for my last couple of nights. Fortunately they did and I immediately checked out of the Hotel California.In all - the hotel isn't bad - the rooms just aren't as nice as the website shows them to be. The neighborhood is withing walking distance to Union Square, but the neighborhood it is in is less than desirable with the amount of aggressive homeless people. Would I stay here again? If there wasn't any other choices nearby and if my family wasn't coming with me. Other than that, I'll be looking for another hotel for my next stay in the area."
67,2018,"Feb 22 2008 	What a surprise	Unusually pleasant stay. Has one of the best vegetarian restaurants I have EVER experienced (I'm picky and a meat eater and I was entirely satisfied). Front desk staff also acts as perfect understudy for otherwise absent full-time concierge, plus they're funny, smart, helpful. Playful lobby music had me bobble-headed and wiggly while awaiting the elevator, complimentary shot of tequilla upon check-in (come-on guys - buy some Patron) actually launched my vacation. Rooms are tiny, but completely adeqaute. Baths are basic, comfy, totally tight and clean though not state of the art. I had a nice flat screen on the wall, my traveling companions had a big bulky CRT. So it's inconsistent, but nothing is BAD. Who owns this hotel? So Invest a little more, would ya please!The neighborhood ranges from homeless army-of-zombies to the coolest hotels I could imgaine. I landed here cuz I coudn't get a room at Hotel Nikko or the Clift Hotel. OK - not the same place at all. And yes I figured these were neighbors - so I'm Stupid. . Still - I was pleased and laughed cuz I was trying to find a 4 star wowzer. This isn't a snooty 4 star - but neither is it self-absorbed and pretentious, unlike the Stanford Court which I stayed in later, (4 stars and looks like it was decorated by Lady Bird Johnson in 1964).Like almost every great hotel - it's the line staff who make it great. Buildings are ho-hum; smart helpful people make travelers feel connected and safe, and therefore - adventurous! This hotel has that sort of staff. Thanks to you all."
68,2018,"Feb 11 2008	no smoking	i have stayed at the hotel california several times. i enjoy the accessability to union square shopping, eateries, and nightlife. the hotel houses one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the world--the millenium. i had a major problem with the staff and the management. the front desk charged me $100 for smoking in the room. i was not smoking in the room. the staff could not take the charge off of the bill without the management approving it. the manager was out of town for the next few days. well, after two phone calls with the manager he said that he had debited my card which was not true. after a few more attempts to reach the manager i gave up on my $100 and i have given up on the hotel california. from my experience with this disservice i will never stay at the hotel again. i am passing this information on to other travelers who should be very wary of extra charges to their bills."
69,2018,"Jan 2 2008 	Enjoyed our stay at Hotel California	Pros- Excellent location. We walked with luggage from BART station. Felt safe walking to hotel at night, but would venture too far past it from Union Square. The decor was cool and casual. Lobby was inviting. Our room was perfect and clean. The bed was comfy. They are small boutique rooms. Don't expect a lot of empty space. Had everything we needed though. They offer a shot of tequila at check in. Wine &amp; cheese every day from 4-6pm. Friendly staff. Price was good. Cons- Thin windows and location allow for street noise. Be prepared. We were expecting it, so it didn't change our good feelings of the hotel. But if you need a quiet room to sleep this might not be your hotel."
70,2018,"Dec 4 2007 	OK hotel in downtown location	This was a nice hotel, with a few little problems.Nice breakfast included, staff friendly and helpful. Free computer and printer available.Room was clean and tidy with individual decor.On the downside it was quite noisy and as the hotel is fairly old, you could hear lots of plumbing noises as well as the street noise from outside.Didn't like downtown San Francisco, so would not recommend staying in this area, but if you like city life, probably a good location.Be aware that the hotel restaurant is vegan and therefore not to everyone's taste."
71,2018,"Nov 14 2007 	Great Location Great Staff Great Rooms	The location is great, just 3 or 4 blocks off Union Square and easily accessible from SFO via BART or taxi. The staff was always accommodating and the rooms were very nice. Even a bit large by San Fran standards! The price was also extremely reasonable.The stay was made a bit more enjoyable by the nightly wine and cheese from 4-6. The wine wasn't the best in the region to be sure, but it was a nice way to spend an hour before heading to dinner.Although we never ate at the accompanying restaurant, it sure smelled good and served an array of organic, vegetarian dishes.This is our third stay in SF and the best hotel. I would fully recommend this location."
72,2018,Nov 1 2007 	Not Bad at All!	I loved where this hotel was located it was a little off the beaten path but the hotel&quot;s staff and rooms where right on the money. The 38 bus ran right in front of the hotel and many shops and even a Walgreens was available for the last minute things you forgot. The Bart station was four short blocks away and you had access to the Mall and the other shopping and attractions in the area. I was told in the last leg of my trip that this was a bad area but you couldn't tell. Being Halloween and all but it was worth the money paid on the hotel.. Front Hotel Doors where locked at 10pm so you didn't feel invaded...I loved the bright yellow rooms and the beds were to die for really nice big comforters.. Man I would stay here again with all the free hot coffee and breakfast you can eat!
73,2018,"Oct 30 2007 	Nice but less than what I expected	The best thing about this hotel was the wine and cheese reception and location. We checked in at around 2pm, and the room was ready. We were under the impression that the family suite that we had booked had two seperate rooms along with a sitting area. Very wrong. We walked in the door to find the bathroom straight ahead, and a bedroom on either side of it. No sitting room at all. Not only was there no sitting room, but there isn't even a table and chairs in either room. Each room had a single chair. So if you think you're going to have a quiet meal in your room, make room in the bed. The family suite has one room with a king bed, dresser, and two night stands. The other room has two twin beds with one night stand, no dresser. It did have a fridge, but no microwave. Guess that just adds to the thing against eating in your room.Another down side is the noise. Evidentally the hotel is extremely close to the local fire station. All night long, every night the engines and sirens were blasting. Even with the windows closed. But a lot of the time they are open, as the hotel has no air conditioning, and only has heat in the rooms. The hotel also has a restaurant on site. But it's a vegetarian restaurant, so it's not for everybody. Thank goodness there are a lot of good restaurants around within walking distance. For the valet parking, when we did decide to go out, many times they were a bit slow in bringing the car around. There was even an instance, while during the wine and cheese reception that another guest was going to be late to a meeting, and had been waiting for her car for nearly 30 minutes. Also, this is not a very automated hotel. No automated wake up calls. We called for a wake up call, as one person in our party needed to leave early in the morning. Thank goodness she set her wireless phone's alarm clock, because all of us heard her make a call to the front desk, using the speaker phone (since the receiver on the phone and their room didn't work), only to have the clerk say that nothing was down for our room.I feel that we probably could have done better as for amenities in the same locale. However, for the area, it one of the less pricey properties. Would I stay there again? If there was nothing else available in the vicinity of Union Square, would be the only reason. I would suggest that you pay a few extra dollars and go with something a little better. Stay at your own risk."
74,2018,"Sep 5 2007	Terrific Boutique Hotel	Our family ( 2 adults with 2 teens) from Calgary, Canada stayed in Hotel California for an entire week from August 23 to 27, 2007. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay, especially for the price. The staff were not just helpful but even enthusiastic. We were greeted very pleasantly when we first walked in the door and every time thereafter. Every day they gave us wonderful recommendations on places to dine close by (something difficult to do among all of the terrific establishments in San Francisco) and great tips on how to get around and things to see that most tourists don't experience. We booked a family suite on the 5th floor which was perfect for us. Not large rooms but enough so that there was a bit of privacy for everyone. The rooms were well kept, clean and even happy with the wonderful colours, San Francisco quotes hand-painted as borders and framed posters. Art and historical photos are sprinkled throughout the hotel. Every evening there was wine and cheese in the lobby which we definitely took advantage of because we met many people from all over the world. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their stay. If you don't want to go out The Millenium vegan restaurant in the hotel is excellent. That takes a lot to say since we are part of a competition barbeque team, but it was a highlight.If there is a downside, it is small. The hotel is on Geary Street which can get a little noisy from time to time, particularly when the lounge across the street lets out. But then, perhaps the solution is to join the crowd as we two adults did one night when the teens were tired and wanted to &quot;veg&quot;. We made up for our &quot;sins&quot; by joining the congregation at The Glide Church a couple of blocks away for a Sunday service like nothing we've ever seen anywhere else. Loads of fun.Hotel California is ideally located 3 blocks from Union Square, cable cars, Chinatown and a whole lot of fun. We are very grateful to the staff for helping us with one of the best family vacations we've ever had. Highly, highly recommended. We will definitely be back."
75,2018,Aug 18 2007	Good Value Central Location	Boutique type rooms. Small but quaint. Enough room for two adults comfortably. Free wireless access! Or use the free computer and printer on second floor. Wine and Cheese! Agree with the reviews about noise. We were on the 3rd floor facing the street and it was very noisy. We had to obtain ear plugs at Walgreens down the street. Love Chad at the front desk. Great help. Two blocks down from Union Square. Close enough to walk with all of our shopping.
76,2018,"Aug 17 2007 	Great Basic Hotel in Union Square	If you are looking for a great basic place to stay the Hotel California is perfect. Don't go in expecting anything fancy. But if you are looking for a clean room and a convenient location this is your place. It is a good home base sort of hotel for people who want to spend a lot of time out and about in the city but want a place that is comfortable to come back to and does not cost a fortune. The rooms are on the small side but are spotless and the beds are really cozy. The bathrooms are small and could use a facelift - the hotel has been recently rennovated but they have not paid enough attention to the bathrooms. Otherwise, they are adequate.I spent a lot of time researching hotels in SF for guests for my wedding ( i lived in SF until a few months ago) and I was suprised by how shabby and run down so many of the &quot;boutique&quot; hotels are, especially for what they charge. It was kind of appalling. I found the Hotel California to be one of the few places that I was comfortable reccomending to our more budget concious guests. My mom has stayed here for weeks at a time and loves it and I stay here when I come to SF for business. I would agree with other reviewers that there is some street noise, but what do you expect if you want to stay in Union Square. Bring a pair of earplugs and you will be fine."
77,2018,"Aug 14 2007 	Fast and loose with the rates	This is a nice boutique hotel close to Union square with much charm. We have stayed several times before. For a weekend in August, Friday night was 169$, San night quoted at 189$. A later phone call to the desk and 169$ was quoted for Saturday night. However, while we were in the lobby after checking in, walk-ins were quoted $129 for available rooms for both nights. What are the rates? This inconsistency can make a nice hotel not so nice. There should be some logic to the rate structure. Are the rooms different? I don't think so."
78,2018,"Aug 13 2007 	Not that great of a hotel	The hotel was a good price but parking for 2 nights was over $65.00. The room was small. The street noise was so loud. I could not sleep because I was hot so I had to open the window and it was too loud. No A/C. It's an old spooky building. You can't smoke in the rooms so we had to go outside. Once outside all the homeless/crack heads beg you for money and won't take no for answer. No pool. On the plus side the room was clean and cute, you get unlimited free wine and cheese around 4PM to 6PM, free coffee in the morning, free internet access."
79,2018,"Aug 1 2007 	Wonderful charm...	Very charming hotel, centrally located in downtown San Francisco. Steps from theatres and just a few blocks from the shopping district and Union square. Easily accessible to the major tourist spots. Staff knowledgeable and accommodating to our early arrival. Hotel is equipped with a wonderful restaurant, clean (and well equipped) fitness room, wireless internet and a welcoming wine &amp; cheese. Breakfast is available in the mornings (reasonably priced). Rooms are quaint with high ceilings, hardwood floors and are very quiet. Everything is very clean and well decorated. All this at a VERY reasonable price. Overall, a great value in an amazing city."
80,2018,"Jul 31 2007 	Except for Tony stay was great!	Do Not Expect Tequila on check in!Firstly, be aware if you book with Orbitz and hate your hotel, you are stuck. We were greated with a obviously stressed Tony, although we were the only ones in the lobby. Our room was promised after 3pm. At 3335, we were told there was a &quot;problem with a backed up toilet in the room&quot;. Not a good start. We were told that was the only room available (possibly because we were &quot;prepaid&quot; as Tony told us over and over, so beware of how you book, you may get a lesser room because you are stuck and they know it). We asked if they could find us another hotel and we were rudely informed by Tony that he would &quot; hold our reservation&quot; until we found another room but they wouldn't help us find another hotel. Again, Tony reminded us that we were &quot;prepaid&quot;. In other words, we were stuck. Room was great, double pained windows, quiet. Clean, clean, clean. Offered tequila on checkout, not by Tony. Would have been perfect exept for check in."
81,2018,"Jul 26 2007 	Good Experience	Would highly recommend this hotel. Can not beat the rate. I paid $139 per night, not including tax and parking($29/day). The room was spotless, bed comfortable and nicely decorated. I would agree with some other posts that the city noise makes it hard to get sound sleep but what do you expect if you want to stay near Union Square and the Theater District. By the way, 1 block away Jersey Boys is playing thru September. If had known that I would have purchased tickets($99 for pretty good seats but sold out). The hotel is about 7 blocks from the gates of China Town and 4 blocks from Union Square. Wine and Cheese from 4-6pm but I did skip the tequilla shot at check in...maybe next time. Just be aware that the rooms are rather small so dont expect some sort of suite with desk, chair, minibar, etc.. I dont stay at too many fancy hotels when I travel. A hotel room is just a place to clean up or sleep before the next activity ,but I will say the Hotel California exceeded my expectation and based on the price and my taste, it might be the best hotel in the city from which to base out of."
82,2018,"Jul 17 2007 	Hated Hotel California	First of all, as soon as we checked into the room, which was supposed to be smoking, by the way, someone started calling from the front desk to see if we were smoking, which we weren't. The bed was so soft it dips way down across the middle portion and you have to sleep bent over, mold in bathroom on shower curtain and tub around wall. The noise from the street was horrible, and we got no sleep at all. The breakfast was a joke. The elevator stops working every time someone new gets on.The only good thing is the coffee."
83,2018,"Jun 6 2007 	Great Boutique Hotel	I stayed at the Hotel California for a major conference in SF in May.Staff was very helpful and were great at sorting out restaurants and bars.The room I had was on the 5th floor facing the street. The room was small by US standard but more than adequat. Nicely decorated, comfortable bed, flat screen TV, desk, coffee maker etc... Free wifi was a plus too.The room was quite noisy, mainly due to street noise and a nearby fire station. Some of my colleagues mentioned that the walls were too thin and they could hear their &quot;active&quot; neighbours quite clearly...I didn't try the breakfast there but you can find a lot of excellent breakfast places nearby.The location of the hotel is really good, just a few minutes from the shopping scene, the cable car and the conference center.The cheese and wine reception is nothing to write home about but it is a nice touch and we all enjoyed it (although I would not recommend the white...)I didn't have time to try their vegetarian restaurant, but the food I saw from the bar looked very exciting and original (and I'm not a vegetarian). The place was really busy all evening.Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay at this hotel again, for business or pleasure."
84,2018,"Jun 3 2007 	Great value in The City by the Bay	I stayed at the Hotel California last month for two nights for a weekend trip to San Francisco/Napa Valley. I was more than impressed with my stay. The location was very convenient (just a few blocks from Union Square) and the rooms were quiet enjoyable. I booked the suite which had two separate bedrooms with the bathroom in between. The rooms were pleasantly decorated, featured hardwood floors and ceiling fans. The beds were very big (probably King) and quite enjoyable.The front staff were very pleasant and helpful. They helped in sorting out a problem that I had with a bus tour company in spite of the fact that I hadnt booked the tour via the front desk. What was also very impressive with the front desk staff was that it was no problem for me to check into my rooms a good four hours before the official check in time. This was great!I enjoyed the daily wine and cheese that available in the lobby in the early evenings. I wouldnt exactly call it a wine tasting event, but as it complimentary and amble, it did make for a nice respite after spending the day exploring the city.I would certainly stay at the Hotel California  San Francisco again and hope to do so later this year. The only caution I would give has to do with the homeless in this part of the city. If youre not used to seeing it you may be in for a surprise. It certainly didn't pose any problems however and the area was quite safe.Ps  I dont get a tequila shot at check in, but as I was checking in before 11:30 am I didnt think too much of it."
85,2018,"May 15 2007 	An Interesting Stay!	For our vacation to San Francisco we ended up staying 5 days at the Hotel California, formally the Savoy Hotel.This is considered a Boutique Hotel, so yes, the rooms are not big. They are however, colorfully decorated and quite clean. Kuddos to the maids!! The bathroom is also small, but very functional. The hotel staff is exceptionally friendly and very, very, helpful! The bed, well the bed was so wonderful it deserves a seperate mentioning! The mattress and pillows were so comfortable, we would have had the best sleep of our lives - had we not been woken up every morning (but Sunday) quite early (it was technically still dark outside), by the street sweepers and the garbage trucks! We were on the 7th floor and even though this hotel is wonderful, it is old and you can definitely hear the noise from the people in the street, and the sirens from the firetrucks at all hours of the night, made it difficult to stay asleep.Yup, you do hear it all! On a good note: The entire hotel is non-smoking and we loved that. Inaddtion, the hotel provides wine and cheese in the afternoon, very nice touch. Once again, the staff does their best to make certain your visit is pleasant. The hotel is centrally located, so you will have your choice of great restaurants, theater, and of course shopping!! And if you don't mind walking, you're not that far from the BART station. We did not eat at the hotel's restaurant, but it was packed every morning, and of course for dinner.Overall: Small, clean and functional room, amazing mattress and pillows, and of course, a great staff."
86,2018,"May 15 2007	Great San Fran hotel with character	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Cali in S.F. the last weekend in April. It was a great hotel, and very affordable for the location in city. I felt the hotel was just on the border of maybe some questionable areas, but we had no problems around our hotel or anywhere we walked. It is very close to Union Square, and there is alot of options for transportation in the city. The rooms are a bit small, but very nice. And the beds are excellent. Like other reviews, the rooms may not block out sound that well,(street noise, adjacent room noise), but it didn't bother us a bit. It wasn't a big deal at all. Complimentary wine and cheese at happy hour is a great feature, and everyone was very friendly. The only thing I wouldn't reccomend is the continental breakfast. If you have to pay for it, I didn't feel it was worth it. It was included with our package, but went out to breakfast our second morning. Overall, would defnitely stay here again, and highly reccommend to anyone coming into the city. Also valet parking available for $29/night. I researched around, and this seemed comparable to all other hotels in S.F. So I felt the valet service was an excellent choice to go with."
87,2018,"Apr 30 2007 	Delivers as Advertised	This is a &quot;boutique&quot; SF hotel. For that you get old building, small rooms. Knowing that, the room was spotlessly clean, brightly painted with plenty of light and ventilation through windows but no view except the building about 20 feet away. The gentleman at the desk was cheerful and helpful (Sunday check in about 3:00pm). Valet guy met us at the car ($30 valet parking. We did not look around for other parking). No smoking anywhere in building, including all guest roomsNew Twist: A chilled shot of tequila at check in! Since people are lifting the shot glasses you cannot take to room. We passed because by the time we got back down it was dinner time. I like the idea though. Hope they still have it our next visit.We stayed here specifically to eat at the Millennium restaurant which is in the same building. For those of you who have never eaten at a gourmet vegetarian restaurant, treat yourself. Have a great meal and walk up to your room for the night. We have eaten at the Millennium a number of times in its different locations. Never disappointed.We paid $109 hotel rack rate booking through their site. Plus taxes and the parking.Mini negative: young lady at desk when we finished dinner about 9pm was not into eye contact and in response to my question of whether there would be newspapers in the lobby in the morning responded, &quot;no&quot;. The gentleman when we checked in, I am sure, would have explained that I could get one at the liquor store across the street."
88,2018,Apr 17 2007 	Came around	At first I wasn't very happy with the room and felt it was too small. But then the place started to grow on me. The linens were nice and the bed was extremely soft and comfortable. I slept like a baby. The shower was ok. When I found out there was no ice machine near us a full bucket was brought within minutes after calling the front desk. When the worst thing you can say about a place is the slowness of the elevator I guess it passes muster.
89,2018,"Apr 16 2007	Fun little boutique	First off, good location, a 3 block walk to Union Square. The common/main areas of the hotel are clean and the rooms, also, were clean with a slightly (and deliberately) funky decor different from that of your standard hotel room. There is a &quot;fitness center&quot; (4 machines, no weights), and the staff was friendly (although, we were stiffed on our tequila, but were assured we'll get 2 shots next time.) The wine and cheese were unimpressive, and with all the dining options Union Square and San Francisco have to offer, it's surprising anyone would choose to go. The restaurant only does dinner, but they do have a cheap little continental breakfast in the morning, which is nice. Upon return to The City, I would most likely stay at this hotel again."
90,2018,"Apr 13 2007 	Great place to stay	My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in April 07 and found it to be excellent. We got a cheap deal ($95/nt + tax) through an online discount site and this proved to be excellent value. A great location, 3 block downhill walk to Union square, with the 38 bus running from Union Square to a stop near the front door. The reception staff were very helpful and friendly, and directed us to a number of excellent restaurants - all within a block in what we found to be a safe and convenient location to explore the city.Free internet access a bonus."
91,2018,"Apr 2 2007 	The Good 	I recently booked a room for four nights at the Hotel California through Hotwire. Naturally, rooms booked through Hotwire are less desirable, which explains my second floor interior room facing the alley. I really didn't mind the fact that my room faced the alley -- in fact, I was glad as I assumed that would help cut down on the street noise. However, I digress. Let me point out the good points of the Hotel California:Location -- you're less than three blocks from all the action of Union Square. Very centrally located and easily accessible to all other points of the city via public transportation. Some reviewers mentioned the safety of the neighborhood -- I thought the neighborhood was fine, even at night. I never felt threatened or fearful for my safety. However, you are just a few blocks away from the shady/seedy Tenderloin district of San Francisco. So be sure you're know where you're going, direction-wise.Value -- a very good value, especially when booked through Hotwire or other off-price venue (Priceline). However, you have no idea what hotel you're booking until you pay. Compared to most hotel rates in San Francisco, I felt I snagged a real bargain.The Bed! -- the bed in my room was by far one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. They had more than enough pillows (six pillows for one queen size bed) and the sheets and down comforter were what you would typically find at more high end hotels.Free Internet Access was available to guests in the hotel lobby -- a nice touch when you wanted to look up the weather, local restaurants, directions, etc.Room Comfort/Amenities -- the room, although small (but perfectly standard for San Francisco), was cozy and well appointed with bright yellow walls, unique art prints and polished hardwood floors. The room was very clean and also boasted a decent closet with an iron and ironing board and in-room safe. The room also had a small writing desk as well as a dresser and the usual coffee maker, ice bucket, television, etc. The plantation shutter shades were a nice touch, however they do tend to let a good bit of light in (not good if you like the room nice and dark).Clean and Functional Bathroom -- the bathroom was small, but perfectly functional. However, the bathroom does need to be updated (the lighting fixtures were rusting over and the toilet seat was chipped and worn).Nice lobby and fairly friendly staff -- the lobby complemented the feel of the hotel. The staff for the most part were professional and courteous, however they were not overly friendly. The hotel staff's personality/attitude did not affect my stay, however, I thought I would point it out. I will say that if you had a question or a request, they did their best to answer/honor it.Wine and Cheese -- every afternoon from 4:00 - 6:00 p.m., the hotel offered wine, cheese and fruit to guests. That was a nice touch.Now for the bad of Hotel California:Room Noise -- by far, the worst aspect of the hotel and rooms is the noise one experiences. Although the hardwood floors are pretty to look at, they do nothing to mask the noise of footsteps up above you. For some reason, the guests directly above me decided to walk around their room non-stop for two hours (from 11:00 p.m. - 1:00 a.m.) every night. They also enjoyed dropping shoes (or something heavy) on to the floor every 15-20 minutes. The walls of the rooms are very thin and you can hear every word of your next door neighbors' conversations (which did provide some entertainment). Same goes with the hallways; it sounds like the people in the hallway are walking right through your room. Apparently, there is very little or no insulation in the hotel.Room Darkness -- due to my room's location (mine was an interior room on the second floor that was less than a foot from the hotel's skylight), the skylight that was directly beneath my window had a constant light on that totally lit up my room every night (it was like the bat-signal shining directly in your room). I had to go out and purchase an eye mask at Walgreen's down the street after the first night. The handsome plantation shutters, although pretty to look at, did little to filter the light from the skylight below. Also, whenever the neighbors directly across the alley turned on their bathroom light, my room would light up even more. Needless to say, between the light and sound situation, I found it very difficult to sleep. I think this also had to do with the room location. But that's what you get when you book through Hotwire (the less or least desirable rooms). Then again, it's hard to beat Hotwire's rates!One final note, I was not offered the frosted tequila shot when I checked in. I was not bothered by this as I really don't care for tequila. I'm not sure if this was an oversight, but just thought I'd mention it as I noticed other reviewers mentioned the same thing.Overall, the value and location of the hotel far outweigh the negatives of the Hotel California. Just be prepared to know what you're getting yourself in for. If you're looking for a charming, unique boutique hotel with tons of character and personality, this is the place for you. If you're a light sleeper, be sure to bring the earplugs and eye mask.Finally, I will close my review by stating that I would stay at the Hotel California again, but only if I could be guaranteed a room on their top floor, which should eliminate the non-stop footstep noise from above.Enjoy San Francisco -- it's a wonderful city!"
92,2018,"Apr 2 2007 	Nice boutique great location	Stayed here with my husband while he attended a conference. Very convenient location clean rooms, the beds were comfortable and overall we had a very pleasant stay. The staff was friendly and the complimentary wine was actually very good. The detraction from this lovely boutique hotel was the street noise. The garbage trucks woke us up at 5 am."
93,2018,"Mar 23 2007	Great deal nice hotel	For the price, this hotel exceeded our expectations. Lets start with the cold Tequila shots at check in.. loved that!! Next, we found our room to have a nice soft bed and that is the most important part. We enjoyed the wine and cheese in the evening and our package included breakfast, also very good.The only negative was hearing footsteps from the room above and all of the hallway noise, but that wasn't a big deal. We would return again."
94,2018,"Mar 14 2007	Hotel California -- what a lovely place	This was the perfect place for a two-night getaway with my husband. We come to San Francisco at least once a year, and while we are always looking for a bargain we really enjoy a place with good service and a little style, both of which this place had in spades. We arrived too early to check in, but the desk attendant graciously stored our bags and assured us that our room, 706, was &quot;very nice.&quot; She was right. The walls were a cheerful yellow, the bed was king-sized, the sheets were Egyptian cotton, there was a flat-screen TV and the floor was a highly polished wood. The windows actually open, which is a welcome change from the hermetically sealed towers one so often finds in corporate-run chains. We found the room on Travel Zoo and had never stayed there before, so all of this was a pleasant surprise. The hotel serves complementary wine and cheese from 4 - 6 p.m. -- nothing fancy but it was a welcome snack one afternoon when we arrived back after a long walk. A bowl of Granny Smith apples sits on the reception desk, there for the taking, and coffee and tea is available all day, also free of charge. The hotel is on the corner of Geary and Jones, on the Tenderloin side of Union Square. It's an easy walk to Union Square as well as to the Powell St . BART station. The Embarcadero is a pleasant 20-min walk away. We stayed over the weekend and this area is full of bars and therefore noisy at night. The double-paned windows help, as do earplugs. If you forget yours they have a good selection at the Walgreen's right down the block. If you are light-sensitive when you sleep bring something to cover your eyes. The window coverings here let in a fair amount of light, though this room faces west so at least there's no direct a.m. sun. I think we really lucked out with our room -- this is a small hotel and I noticed while we were riding the windowed elevator that some of the interior rooms face the elevator -- when the room shades were open you could see the beds from the elevator! It would have been a major bummer if we'd gotten one of these rooms. For us this was a great place to stay. Having stayed there only once I can't say if our visit was charmed or typical."
95,2018,"Mar 3 2007 	Nice Hotel Great location	My wife and I spent one night at the Hotel California Feb 23rd on the second night of our most recent trip to California. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff from check-in until we checked out was superb. They couldn't do enough for us, giving us local maps and marking points of interest, offering ideas for evening drinks and dinner within a few blocks of the hotel and giving us two city passes left at the desk by previous guests. Our room was somewhat small but beautifully appointed. Nice comfortable bed, hard wood floors and nice bright colors and prints on the walls. The hotel has complimentary wine and cheese between 4-6 pm. Both were fine but nothing exceptional. Considering it was complimentary though it was a nice touch.Breakfast was included in our package and was served in the Millennium Restaurant on the first floor of the hotel. Eggs, breads, muffins and fantastic granola.The location of the hotel is superb. If ambitious you can walk a few blocks to Union Square, down through Chinatown and to Fisherman's Wharf and back. We walked back from the Wharf on Jones St. Great walk but quite a steep hill. The views of the bay are fantastic though so if you're up to it I suggest this walk.A few more recommendations. Walk to the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins Hotel a few blocks away on California St. and have a drink at their bar on the top floor of the hotel. Awesome views of the entire city. Have a drink before dinner at the Clift Hotel just down the street from the Hotel California. Great drinks and a good place to people watch.If you like Indian food, the New Delhi Restaurant a few blocks away on Ellis St. is wonderful. If you like it spicy try their Chicken Madras or Chicken Vindaloo. Both delicious.Overall, high marks for the Hotel California. We'd stay here again."
96,2018,"Feb 12 2007	Pleasant reasonable and comfortable	We stayed here for a Friday and Saturday night, and there were many small things that added up to a very pleasant stay. Chad at the front desk was cheerful and helpful. We had a king deluxe room on the top floor, so it was relatively quiet, for being in the center of a big city. There is free internet access at two locations, in the lobby and mezzanine. The hot coffee in the lobby was fine, but you can use the small in-room coffemaker if you like. There is a complimentary wine, cheese and fruit buffet for two hours every day, and they offered us a tequila shot at check-in. Very hospitable! The beds were very comfortable, and I liked the upscale linens instead of those polyester bedspreads you still find in some places. The location, near many more expensive hotels, is convenient . I would stay here again."
97,2018,"Feb 12 2007 	Noisy but charming	I stayed at this hotel in Feb 2006 when it was still called the Savoy Hotel. Some of the rooms on other levels were being renovated so there was some noise, but since we were out and about all day that didn't matter so much. What did matter and what was out of control of the hotel was all the noise on the streets. Mainly fire engines and yelling people. I don't know who was lighting all those fires but even earplugs couldn't block those sirens out. The people I think were drunk hobos and tourists and were yelling out random stuff all night long. Maybe the intensity of the noise was due to the location of our room, but it was really difficult to sleep.The room itself was ultra-tiny. But it was very nicely deocrated, had everything we wanted, including some complimentary chocolates and painting on the ceiling. I loved how they'd painted the lyrics to 'Hotel California' by the Eagles around the ceiling. Nice touch.The bathroom was a good size and everything worked satisfactorily. The bed was comfortable, and the tv reception was good.I love that they offered free internet access for guests though you had to pick a quiet time to use the computers.We didn't try out the restaurant on the ground floor but I wish we did, it looked very nice and the food smelled good too.The staff were helpful, a few gave us a tiny bit of attitude but overall they were great.The location was good, it's a few blocks walk to Union Square and the trams. There are bars, diners and cafes all around it. Be sure to avoid Dotties for breakfast. Everyone says it's good there but all i got was attitude and half-cooked blueberry pancakes. The coffee was crap too. There are plenty of other eateries to enjoy.I'd stay here again. I'd love to see what they've done with the place since my visit."
98,2018,"Jan 29 2007 	Good :Location great bargain	Nice hotel, good location, good restaurant on site. Rooms are clean and updated. Great value for your money in a good location, just minutes from Union Square"
99,2018,"Jan 24 2007	Hotel California good value	Over this last weekend we stayed at Hotel California in San Francisco. It is a nice small hotel centrally located in downtown near the theater district, Union Square and close enough to the BART to walk. The hotel is a good value we stayed in a &quot;sun room&quot; for 135.00 plus tax. The room had great light and was bright and cheery. Beds were very comfortable. This is an old hotel that has been kept up nicely. However if you are light sleeper you might bring earplugs. The walls are thin and if you have a room with an adjoining room door it can be loud. Of course it is the city and you can hear some street noises, sirens, horns etc. If you want silence you should go to one of the big hotel chains. The staff was very helpful and had good clear maps and recommendations for food/drinks. They have a complimentary wine and cheese hour that was a welcome surprise. Don't be scared off by the frosty tequila at check in. I had read a review with that in it and it seemed weird. But it was fun! And tasty.We did not eat in the restaurant in the hotel. Seven dollars for breakfast seemed a bit high considering it was not much more than a continental breakfast. We did go to brunch at a great place just down the street called Colibri it was great. Have the mole. Also a great bar just across the street Swig. Go early it was hopping later. This is a good mid level hotel. We will stay there again."
100,2018,"Jan 23 2007 	Cute Hotel	We booked for one Saturday night in January. Nice hotel with very very accomodating people. Good rate and nice location. We had a &quot;family suite&quot; that consisited of a room with a King bed, tv,dresser and a seperate room with 2 twins, tv, dresser. The bathroom was in between off of the little hallway. Only down fall is that with this layout there is really no place to sit other than on the bed. I would stay again."
101,2018,"Jan 11 2007 	Loved my stay!!	My boyfriend and I had an amazing stay at the Hotel California for New Years Eve 2007. The only problem that we had was parking. We tried finding parking on our own but that proved to be impossible so we did valet which was $29. The price was expected because it is a big city. The room we stayed in was exactly like the ones in the picture on their website. It was clean, bright, and uniquely decorated. The front desk was extremely helpful and so was the valet service when I realized that I left something in the car that I needed at 1am in the morning. The cheese and wine were a nice treat in the middle of the day. We had the ask for the tequila shot when we checked in but that wasn't a problem. When I left my camera and other personal items at the hotel, they were promptly UPS'ed back to me. I had an outstanding stay. I would definitely recommend it and would stay again."
102,2018,"Jan 5 2007 	Nice boutique hotel in a fabulous city!	Im working on fulfilling my New Years resolution to be more diligent about writing hotel reviews on tripadvisor!We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in December 2006.Overall Hotel California offers a fantastic value. The two things that really did it for me were the beds (very comfortable and we loved the flannel sheets!) and the free internet with printer on the mezzanine. Our room was not large but nicely decorated and very sunny with a good sized bay window looking out onto Geary Street. I did not notice traffic sounds during our stay, but I also sleep like the dead so its no surprise. The room had wood floors so I halfway expected my socks to pick up dust and whatnot walking around, but the floor was spotless- as was the entire room. The staff members were generally very helpful and pleasant. Several times they assisted us with public transportation schedules and attraction information. Note: None of them appeared to be a 'concierge' per se and noone offered to make us dinner reservations when asked about restaurants, so expect to take care of these details on your own. We love boutique hotels with eclectic features, so this was a good fit for us. If you prefer large corporate-style hotels this may not be the place for you. Next time we are in San Fran we will likely stay at the Westin, but as a more economical alternative only 2 blocks down, this place is great! Honestly, this may be one of the best values in San Fran, a place that defies the meaning of 'value'. We were only disappointed we couldnt stay longer in this great city."
103,2018,"Dec 15 2006 	Cute hotel needs a little more attention to detail	I chose this hotel for a recent trip to San Francisco because of its location, price and the proximity (in the hotel!) of the excellent Millennium restaurant. It didn't disappoint on any of those counts.The room was cozy--not at all spacious but not uncomfortably small. This is not a problem for me at all, as I like small spaces, and anyway just need a place to crash. And the bed was very comfortable, including plush pillows and a comforter. The room included a mini-fridge, which was not plugged in, a small coffeemaker (also unplugged) and, on the other side of the room, two lamps flanking the bed, both of which were unplugged.Seeing a pattern? This sounds like a minor complaint except that the way the furniture was arranged and the locations of the outlets made it a pain to have to plug all this stuff in. Which may be why the management never bothered to do it, but who cares--I shouldn't have to.There were also small stains on the linens: One stain about the size of a half dollar on the comforter and a smaller stain on the washcloth. No big deal, but kind of gross. A hotel that provides white linens should make sure they're spotless.The hotel does have some thoughtful touches. Tequila shots at check-in set the mood. The first few floors have free WiFi and there are two computers, including one with an attached printer (free), for guests' use. The lounges on the ground floor and on the mezzanine are very comfortable. From 4-6, the hotel hosts a free reception for guests with wine, cheese sticks, fruit, and crackers. Not exactly fine dining, but it's a nice touch.The hotel offers continental breakfast for $7 in the onsite Millennium restaurant. This breakfast is put on by the hotel, NOT the restaurant, which is open only for dinner and is a great place for inventive vegetarian (vegan, in fact) cuisine."
104,2018,"Dec 9 2006 	Great place to stay	Great hotel.The room had a beautiful hardwood floor the beds where comfortable (pillow top I think) . The rooms where not large but perfect for what we needed. I stayed here with my mother for her birthday and we both thought that hotel california was great. Fresh apples at the front desk very modern and hip. I have recommended this hotel to others and all have had the same experience. The attached vegetarian restraunt also was just as good, worth checking out. If you are with a large group be sure to make reservations, we went to the restraunt on a Saturday night and they said that they where booked but you can sit at the bar and eat there so it was just as good. I would recomend this hotel to anyone just visiting the city and wants to be in a hip convenient location!!"
105,2018,"Nov 20 2006 	Overall a Good Stay after a few problems	We stayed at what was called The Savoy, and has since been renamed the Hotel California (presumably to match the sister Hotel California in Santa Monica) over Memorial Day weekend. The first night was a problem. We checked in before our room was ready, so we left our luggage and went sight-seeing for the day. We knew we were going to be back late at night, and we made sure to tell the front desk that. But when we returned at 10 p.m. and went up to our room, there were other guests in our room!!! Good thing we heard the voices coming from the room before we barged in. So we had to spend that night in a slightly smaller room on a lower level (i.e., closer to the street and noisier) than the room we had checked into. Once we finally got into a room, we couldn't figure out how to open the drain in the tub. It turns out, it spins on an axis rather than pops up. But when we called down to the front desk, the person there had no idea how to open the drain. He also told us that other people had the same problem, so we weren't the only ones who couldn't figure it out. We went without a shower that night and the next morning until they finally sent someone to &quot;fix&quot; the drain.But the second and third nights were much better. We got our slightly larger &quot;deluxe&quot; room. It's basically the same as the standard room, just with a bay window. The rooms are small, but nicely decorated and comfortable. The staff were good. Our bathroom could have used a good scrubbing to get off some of the mold between the tiles, but it was otherwise clean. I liked that there are two available computers for guest use, and you can even print for free.We had breakfast at the Millenium, which is inside the hotel. It was fine. Nothing special."
106,2018,Oct 24 2006 	wont go again	hotel is small and was advertised on expedia as &quot;the savoy&quot;.not very happy at that as it took ages to find.it had a name change a couple of weeks prior to us going and they had not told us.hotel is very small as are the rooms. the room we booked was described as &quot;delux&quot; but is was very small.the car was Valet parked and when they brought it back the tyre at the rear of the car was flat to the rim.they even drove it several blocks with a flat tyre.when i complained to the hotel they were not bothered.hotelhas one small and very old elevator.rooms are clean but the hotel is on the edge of a shady district.one night we heard gun shots followed by the arrival of a police car to a nearby hotel.okfor budget but my advice is to pay more money and always stay on the wharf area.
107,2018,"Oct 10 2006 	Run the other way	We came for a business stay at this hotel in October of 2006. Brought along the family, and were booked into what the property called a 'family suite'. The suite was in actuality 2 small rooms with a bathroom in between. Hardwood floors (in a family suite, no less), and windows on the 4th floor that opened... with no screens. Exposed electrical plugs and lighting wired with extension cords, this was not family friendly.The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom would have been a nice touch, if (#1) it had worked... and (#2) if it had been clean. There was hair both in the tub and a huge glob of green slimy hair in the drain, which had obviously been there a long time. When housekeeping was called to please clean the tub, they arrived and (since I had already cleaned the gob of hair out of the drain), they concentrated on cleaning the trash can that I'd thrown the hair into.After explaining that I was more concerned with the bathtub it came out of, the person wiped the tub out with a towel. I gave up trying to explain basic housekeeping principles. The &quot;ewww factor&quot; was just too much.The room was extremely noisy and not set up comfortably. For a family suite, there was no central area, just the two bedrooms. No significant table space to place food when ordering in, it was cramped and awkward.When we booked the suite, we specifically asked about internet access at the hotel--a must have for business purposes, and we had several marketing seminars online that we were scheduled to attend, in order to make money. Internet service was one of the reasons we booked this hotel, it says it is available on the website, and both of us called the hotel at different times to confirm that it was available IN THE ROOMS throughout the hotel. We were assured that wireless internet access was available throughout the hotel and in the rooms.It was not. We were not able to connect at all during our 3-day stay, either morning, evening or afternoon. At any place in the hotel. Several other patrons approached me as I was trying to get a connection at different places in the hotel with the same problem, they had also been promised internet access by staff and were unable to get it. Looking up old reviews on this hotel, this has been an ongoing complaint, which the staff repeatedly lies about, and when questioned about it, act clueless.When checking out, we were told that a cart would be brought up to our room within 5-10 minutes. Two hours later, and half a dozen trips past the hotel's front desk to load our vehicle (which, by the way, was brought out by Valet Parking-- at $29/day, it was the only thing that was as promised). The cart never arrived.If you are booked at this hotel, or considering it, run the other way. For $169/night, I expected a clean room, excellent service, and what I was promised and paid extra for. Instead, we were disappointed around every corner."
108,2018,"Oct 5 2006 	Great location value and service	This hotel was great. It's located just a few mins from Union Square, with all the top stores like Macys, Saks, Bloomingdales etc,and is surrounded by superb bars, restaurants and diners. The rooms are quiet,clean, and with the most comfortable beds. All the staff were very helpful, and it offered the best value we have seen. Its Millenium Restaurant is an award winning Organic Vegan Restaurant, but if this isn't your choice, there are dozens of other great restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed the free internet service, and used it to plan further excursions. Altogether, we rate this hotel highly, try it you won't be dissapointed."
109,2018,"Sep 26 2006 	Cute and friendly boutique hotel	The Hotel California is perfect for those travellers who are more into getting out and about and seeing the sights, rather than sitting in a hotel room all day.I was a single traveller, who was looking for comfort, value and location. Hotel California had all three. The location is central, it is only about three blocks from Union Square, an easy walk, and from there you can catch the famous cable cars to Fisherman's Wharf etc. or do some serious shopping in Union Square! However I do not recommend walking on your own at night, as it is almost on the border of the Tenderloin area, so catch a cab at night (it isn't too far from anywhere), but other times it is fine and I felt perfectly safe walking around. I paid US$125 a night and was pleasantly surpised by the room (double bed) and the Hotel. The rooms are a bit on the small side, but they are clean and comfortable and have everything you need to for a good night's sleep. There is a bit of street noise, and noise from the outside hallway from other guests, however it is no worse than any other hotel in the city and ear plugs will fix that anyway! They have a free wine and cheese reception from 4pm and this is the perfect way to either start your night or just relax and watch the world go by and unwind after a busy day sightseeing.The hotel staff are friendly, and only too happy to help with questions, maps, airport transfers and tours. They also offer free internet access to guests, which was convienent. I would certainly stay here again, as the value for money is exceptional in a city that can become quite expensive for hotels.Just a side note: The Vegan Restaurant in the Hotel is definately worth a visit. I am not a vegan, but was curious to try this cuisine. This restaurant has absolutely devine food, and an extensive menu that is delicious and filling. I would recommend you have at least one meal here to experience it."
110,2018,"Sep 12 2006	Very cute hotel	The hotel is very cute and stylish. Stayed in a delux queen. The bed was quite comfortable, with good sheets and duvet. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The location is great--its a nice part of town. Valet parking was prompt and courteous, but there is self parking less than half a block down the same street for a fraction of the price.Negatives: very noisey, so bring ear plugs (not just street noise, but we could hear people in the room next door too), soap/shampoo/etc. were not upto par with the style of the hotel (in other words, generic crap that we didn't use), and minor detail is that towels were very thin and not soft."
111,2018,"Aug 25 2006 	Fabulous Stay!	I absolutely loved my stay at the Savoy last week! I was surprised to find out when I checked in that I was getting a suite for the price I was quoted for a queen room. The wine &amp; cheese in the afternoon was delicious, and it was relaxing to sit in the mezzanine overlooking the restaurant. The hotel is located a few blocks from Union Square, which is great for tourists because it's the starting point for many trolley/bus tours. It's also very close to Chinatown which offers great shopping!My room was street-side, so I did hear some noise from the traffic &amp; people leaving the bar (Swig) across the street. However, it was nothing that really kept me awake.I highly recommend this hotel with its immaculate rooms, helpful staff, and great location!"
112,2018,"Aug 24 2006 	Nice time at the Savoy	We recently stayed at the Savoy hotel in San Francisco. Although there were a few glitches, we overall had a very nice stay. I have to agree with the previous reviewer, many of the amenitites listed were not included. We did not get a frosted tequila shot upon check in, nor were there any robes. The rooms are a bit small, but the bed was very comforable. Unfortunately, it was very hard to sleep late in this great bed because of the obscene amount of noise outside our room. The maids are super loud in the mornings! The location is great- a small walk to Union Square but nothing crazy. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. However, the hotel needs to offer the amenities it lists out of fairness to guests."
113,2018,"Aug 23 2006 	Savoy soon to be Hotel California clean and charming just no water pressure	We found a great deal through travelzoo - $95 per night which included breakfast, and booked directly through the hotel website to get the deal. The good stuff: 1. Breakfast at the hotel is worthwhile *if it is included*. Otherwise, save your $7 and get it someplace like cafe trieste. It was included in our stay and munching on pastries, yogurt, fruit and hardboiled eggs was a wonderful way to start our days with something tasty and get some energy in the morning. 2. Free wine and cheese at 4pm. We took advantage of this every day and it was really yummy. 3. Clean room with hardwood floors, nice decorations, and just a very comfy feel. 4. Very convenient location - a couple blocks from Union Square, in a safe/peopled part of the city. At the Walgreens nearly next door, you can get any needed toiletries and some extra cash (cash back) without the ATM fees. Also, all of the good Thai restaurants are one block away. (I recommend Ar Roi).The not-so-good stuff:1. Water pressure in the bathroom left MUCH to be desired. 2. No coffee maker in the rooms. However, coffee is served in the lobby for free all day long, so that makes up for it. Gotta have my coffee first thing!The good outweighed the bad and I will return to this hotel if I can get the same deal. Note: the hotel is under a name change and will be called the Hotel California in the future. I think this is a good move as the name &quot;Savoy&quot; isn't all that memorable."
114,2018,"Aug 14 2006 	Charming but a little disappointed	My fiance and I stayed in a bay room (room with a bay window which I believe is supposed to be a step up from the standard room) for three nights at the beginning of our San Francisco trip and the furniture and decor was wonderful- Solid, dark wood desk with chair, queen sized bed, and small dresser/minifridge/TV stand combo. The room was sunny with hardwood floors (or laminate hardwood floors), a buttery paint color, and crisp white shutters. The double pane windows definitely helped cut out the street noise. There's a mini bottle of wine, along with a well-stocked minifridge with pleasantly decent prices. The hotel itself is absolutely lovely and charming- The service (with the rare exception of the initial person who checked us in, who was totally apathetic and was apparently too cool to be bothered to do her job with a smile) was great and the computer lounge above the lobby with high speed access and printer was also really useful. We decided to stay at The Savoy largely because of the Millenium Restaurant (my fiance is Vegan and I'm Vegan-friendly haha). We were happy overall with our stay but the following were some disappointments. Note that with a few exceptions, we probably wouldn't have been disappointed with their absence if we hadn't been expecting them, based on the hotel's statements on their website and from some of the reviews in travel books we read. Note also, that these comments may not apply to all rooms (but I guess the point is that they imply on their website that they DO apply to all rooms, even if they don't). The rooms are definitely SMALL (I think the bay room is supposed to be a little bigger than the smallest room, but I honestly can't imagine a room being smaller and still functional for more than one person). The location is very convenient to everything around Union Square but it's about a block or two further away from &quot;the action&quot; and that distance consists of a parking lot and some other areas that aren't necesarily bustling with activity so that it's a little intimidating to walk at night from the square up to the hotel since you have to walk about a black that's somewhat removed from the rest of the businesses closer to the center of Union Square. (check out my review of the Hotel Diva for other points of interest in the area, and for a discussion about the the pros and cons of the somewhat seedy area, if you want.) The hallways definitely have a noticeable weird smell- Not necessarily unpleasant but difficult to pinpoint. Possibly like really really bad industrial air freshener. It doesn't follow you into the rooms though, so it's only noteworthy if you're particularly sensitive about smells. It didn't bother us and it probably won't bother you unless you're planning to spend a lot of time out in the hall. The place is old, which I appreciate. It's hard to age 92 years gracefully, but the hotel has largely done just that, with the help of some recent renovations. On the other hand, our bathroom was a little shabby and had a pretty unsightly mildew problem in the shower which was a little unsettling. The following are things that were described as amenitites on the Savoy's website and/or in travel books (Fodor's) but we did not find to be true for our stay/room: there was no &quot;chilled tequila shot&quot; (not that this really bothered us since we're not big tequila fans but as an FYI to those of you would look forward to this); our &quot;new Beautyrest&quot; was so squeaky it was almost comical. Simply shifting in bed resulted in a chorus of embarrassing squeaks as the bed protested under our weight. And lest you chalk this up to the normal reaction of a helpless bed to a couple of overweight people, we're both pretty thin! The &quot;400-thread count&quot; sheets were pretty rough. In fact, I'm pretty sure that they weren't 400 thread count. Maybe they were but it just didn't feel like it because they were probably bleached to death but they didn't feel like they were even percale. There were also no &quot;goose down comforters and pillows,&quot; just regular pillows and a typical mass chain hotel comforter. The ceiling fan was great (no air conditioner, which you almost never need in San Francisco) but a little noisy. There was also no bathrobe (as had been included as an amenity, by their website). Again, I'm sure the suites are super nice and contain all those amenities, and maybe our room was just a dud reserved for a couple of dusty looking &quot;kids&quot; (we're 27 and 28, respectively and both attorneys but we can look younger and scruffier, especially freed from our suits and on vacation) towing camping gear for a trip to Santa Cruz and Big Sur, but if you're expecting those amenities, I would just check with the hotel beforehand and see what to really expect if those things matter to you. We paid $139 for a Friday night, and $179 (weekend rate) for Saturday and Sunday each and it was totally booked when we were there (maybe because of the Marathon which was over that weekend). For less than $179, you can stay at the Rex (which has a cool Beat theme due to Kenneth Rexroth) or for $109 you can stay at the DIVA and be a little closer to the restaurants, theatres, bars, shopping, etc. We would still consider staying there again but only if it was a weekday (or we were splurging on a suite).Have a great time in San Francisco and check out the Millenium Restaurant!! The food is sublime. Forgo reservations and just sit at the bar and definitely check out their amazing desserts!! (and please don't be one of those lame people who peer at the menu, see that it's vegan, and then sniff at having to pay 20 bucks for an entree that's not a big steak. I like my big steaks too, but good food is good food!"
115,2018,"Aug 4 2006 	lovely stay in Savoy	My wife and I spent 5 days in san Francisco at The Savoy hotel. Our staying was beautiful: nice room, friendly and helpful staff, cool price for the room (I suggest to contact directly the hotel for good deals) good position (3 blocks from Union Square: if You are arriving from the SFO airport is easy to reach the hotel by Bart). Internet access for free at the lobby (with a printer available!) and a rich continental breakfast at reasonable price.For sure it has been a good choice."
116,2018,"Jun 30 2006	Wonderful !	My wife and I stayed with our two daughters here for a couple of nights, We were in a charming suite. The staff was helpful though occasionally harried. Wine and cheese each late afternoon was welcome and the hotel location is only 2 or 3 short blocks to Union Square. I found this hotel warm and welcoming and would love to return. Great value forthe money spent."
117,2018,"Jun 12 2006	Pass on this one	Do yourself a favor and spend the $40 or $50 extra bucks at the Drake or Westin Inn. Rooms are small and cramped. You don't come to San Francisco to spend time in a hotel room of course, but you do want something somewhat comfortable when you are spending time there. The Savoy is anything but comfortable.Staff will smile at you upon arrival but act annoyed if you ask anything more of them after checking in.Oh, and if you need your car from the parking garage, which also comes with an additional charge because nothing is &quot;included&quot; in San Francisco, be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more.Do yourself a favor. Stay at one of the hotels ON Union Square. They're more expensive, yes, but I'm firmly convinced that the extra expense is well worth it after one trying night at the Savoy."
118,2018,"May 27 2006	Great Location Friendly Staff Nice Hotel	We recently spend four nights at the Savoy Hotel in San Francisco. The staff members were really attentive to our needs. The reservation agent actually thanked me for booking at the Savoy when I made my reservation by phone. This attitude continued while we were there. We were traveling around the city by bus and cable car, and the staff directed us to the De Young Museum by bus, which was by far the best way to go there. They also helped with restaurant suggestions and other directions. Our room was overlooking the street, but the double paned windows kept the noise to a minimum. The bed was large and comrortable and the room clean and well stocked. But the best thing about the Savoy is the location. It is one of the best values at Union Square. The hotel is a scant two blocks away from the square itself, and easliy walkable to all the shops and restaurants around Union Square. The restaurant at the hotel is also quite good. I would recommend the Savoy to anyone visiting San Francisco and looking for a great value and location."
119,2018,May 23 2006 	Charming European Style	Beautifully re-done. Clean and Charming. European-style continental breakfast. Reasonable price. Great location. Will definitely go back again.
120,2018,"May 16 2006	Loved the Hotel!	We have just returned from a weekend at the Savoy Hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is magnificent and the staff provides excellent sevice. The rooms are quaint, and the beds are very comfortable (including egypitian cotton sheets that are very soft). They have a complimentary wine and cheese event during the late afternoon. I would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends!"
121,2018,"May 8 2006	Spectacular Stay	Spent a couple midweek nights at the Savoy and loved it. Great service and wonderful accommodations. The rooms have a European sensibility - Efficient space without sacrificing comfort or elegance. Short walks to fine dining, happening night-life, and great shopping. Strongly recommend."
122,2018,"May 4 2006	Great Hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights after skiing in Lake Tahoe. The hotel is very well located, only a few blocks from Union Square (where most of the big shops are &amp; the nearest cable car/tram).There are 2 computers with free internet access and between 4 and 6pm there is free wine with cheese and crackers in the lobby - great to start you off before the big night!!The restaurant inside the hotel, although vegetarian, is very good and the breakfast is good too, although on the last day we didn't eat there and ended up finding an even better place!The staff are very friendly, ourselves and the couple we were travelling with both got free room upgrades because the hotel wasn't very busy.Within walking distance are plenty of grocery stores to get your sandwiches/snacks/drinks for the day/night and best of all you are only 1 block away from Starbucks!! There are also plenty of very good quality restaurants in the area.The only negatives about this hotel are that you are right on the border of where it starts to get scary - you were regularly asked for spare change etc once you stepped out of the hotel which became annoying after a while. I think the fire station must be nearby too as I was regularly woken in the night by sirens and horns honking!!If you are on a high floor you may want to take the stairs down because the lift is really old and slow.Finally, despite the free wine downstairs, the bottle in your room is not free!!All in all though I would recommend this hotel if you don't mind the begging."
123,2018,"May 1 2006	Lovely hotel!	I stayed here nine years ago and once again on this trip to San Francisco, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay in this lovely hotel. The concierge was helpful, providing information and services. There is free internet with a printer, and every afternoon there is a wine/cheese reception in the lobby. The building is gorgeous, the restaurant inside has great food, and the ambience is fun. Just a couple of blocks away is Union Square, the BART Powell street station, and there are drugstores, restaurants and pubs nearby, along with wonderful art galleries &amp; it's the theatres district, too: the location is great! Chinatown is a 10-minute walk. There is some typical street noise at night, but I had no problem sleeping in the comfortable bed with 400-count sheets. I look forward to visiting the Savoy again someday."
124,2018,"Apr 26 2006	One of the ten best small hotels	We were looking on the internet for a small charming hotel close to Union Square. We found the Savoy Hotel on Geary Street. Good, friendly reception; friendly doorman who did not hold out his hand for a tip. Colorful, clean carpets in the public areas. The room cheerful, apparently recently redecorated in diffeent shades of light and pleasant yellow. Expensive bedding, mattress and sheets. Ask for extra pillows. Two is not enough.On the backside, you'll hear some traffic. Neither the mayor nor the police chief has stopped the bad habit of hanking horns.Overall, at about $ 110/night it's a very good value. We'll go back.Aloha from Hawaii"
125,2018,"Apr 25 2006	Savoy Hotel in San Fran is Wonderful!!	My friend and I recently travelled to San Francisco and stayed at the Savoy Hotel on Geary and Jones Streets. We were both very impressed. The Savoy is a charming hotel located on the edge of the Union Square area. The personnel are very customer service oriented, friendly and helpful. The hotel decor is very charming and they are continuing to do improvements to add more facilities. The rooms are decorated very nicely in somewhat of an art deco flavor. The rooms are a reasonable size, very clean and the best beds I have ever experienced in a hotel other than the Hotel Imperial in Vienna. The rooms are also very quiet when you are staying on a very busy street the double pane glass helps immensely. The hotel offers a very nice continental breakfast for $7.00 and a great wine and cheese Happy Hour from 4-6 pm or maybe it was 4-7, but very nice get together in their lobby. The location of the hotel is perfect, with easy access to Union Square shopping, Fisherman's Wharf and really any place you want to go in San Francisco. It was truly a wonderful hotel experience in every way!!"
126,2018,"Apr 12 2006	Good deal	Typical downtown hotel. Close to shopping and dining, but also close to a busy firebrigade. Our room was quite small but clean and neat. Staff was helpfull. Good budget deal."
127,2018,"Mar 28 2006	Good for your travel budget	Charming building, liked the character. Very small rooms, which seems typical for San Francisco. This hotel met my requirements as far as price versus what we got: a comfortable bed, nice central location, and basic amenities such as a fridge with some snacks and cable tv. The wine and cheese was a nice touch. Other reviewers are right that it can be noisy at night, but this is downtown San Fran....seems like expectation management would be important in this case!As far as location goes, if you're going to San Fran on pleasure rather than business, I'd suggest staying on a more northern side of town. When I was there, I found that much of the fun stuff wasn't directly downtown."
128,2018,"Mar 26 2006 	Average	Stayed for 4 nights. Paid average USD139 per night without breakfast included.Building old but with charm, lifts small, slow and creaky. Same went for accomodation - room small-ish, blinds provided but some non-functional. Sash windows allowed fair amount of street noise through. Bathroom old world but clean, shower excellent. Comfortable beds, room amenities average.Located 3 blocks from Union Square, about 7 minutes brisk walk. On the edge of a rather run-down, dilapidated area and walking back to the hotel at night from Union Square can feel a bit intimidating. Fair amount of traffic noise and &quot;urban&quot; noise from passer-bys.Staff cordial but not warm. Wine and cheese reception in evening good, but runs out fast."
129,2018,"Mar 23 2006	Has old building character and that's about it	Paid $139 mid-week for a queen bed. Nice view of Geary Street, but also comes at the expense of street noise. The double-hung windows were only single-hung on one window frame section, allowing a lot of street noise to pass through.I picked this recommendation from a highly-regarded source: Frommer's. Needless to say, it let me down. The building has old-time charm, but that's where it ends. Here's what I did notice: ongoing construction, construction crew using the one elevator that exists in the hotel, lack of standard amenities (room had only one working electrical outlet), door man that doesn't exists at most times of the day, bathroom which looks like it was remodeled/fixed on a shoestring budget (silicone caulking was abound throughout the tiles).The wine reception between 4PM - 6PM is a nice touch, this is about the only shining area of the hotel's hospitality. My two cents: Old charm, but that's it. One elevator, sacrifice of modern creature comforts in the bedrooms (i.e.: convenient electrical outlets, counter space in the bathrooms) must be dealt with. Management could definitely benefit if their staff would get out from behind the front desk and have more presence with their guests in the lobby and at the front door."
130,2018,"Mar 18 2006 	Could be worse	I stayed here on a Thursday night for $129 and the following Friday for $199. The hotel is a typical old european-style boutique hotel. They've spruced it up a bit but there's no getting around the fact that it's just an old hotel. The lobby is small. The room I had was large. The bed was good. The room had it's own heat control but no air conditioning. The room was clean. There was a TV set with cable (14 channels) and inroom movies for an extra charge. There was a mini bar but the cabinet it was sitting in had literally fallen apart. Bathroom was fine, not much shower pressure but acceptable. The worse part of this hotel for me was the noise. My room faced Geary street and I heard people yelling all night. Additionally, the bed was right by the door and the noise from the hallway kept me up. I got little sleep over the two nights. Valet parking is available at $26 a day. There's no other parking nearby that I could see. The location in pretty good. Three blocks to Union Square. It's a reasonably safe area but on the edge of where things start to get a bit narly. All in all, if this place were 33% cheaper, I'd rate it better. But for the same money, my buddy got a room at the Grand Hyatt via Priceline's bid system and his room was MUCH nicer, quieter and more conveniently located. I'd stay here again in a pinch but it would not be my first choice."
131,2018,"Mar 2 2006 	Excellent- For the Price	MY wife and I stayed at the Savoy for 4 nights the last week of February- we were in San Francisco for a conference. Having spent two nights in a luxury hotel in Yountville, I was nervous because of previous reviews, re. noise, comfort, size of room, etc. The stay was excellent overall. Yes, the rooms are slightly small, but not unlike other &quot;European&quot; boutique hotels- we are fans of The Algonquin Hotel in NYC, as an example- and our room was very reasonably priced. The hotel has lots of character, free internet use, free wine and cheese, a charming lobby, an pleasantly adequate breakfast that came with our price, exceptionally comfortable beds, free coffee. a refrigerator, etc. All the people at the desk were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant, Millenium, is a must! And the room was as quiet as most urban hotel rooms tend to be. We would definately go back."
132,2018,"Feb 26 2006 	best room deal around	I stayed at the Savoy for 4 nights this past week and was very pleased with my choice. The rooms are small by US standards but hey you're in SF and shouldn't be in your room much anyway. The rooms, hallways and lobby were extremely clean with no hint of off odors. Bathrooms were more than adequate with plenty of towels and toiletries although the hot/cold controls on the shower were quirky. As stated by others the bed and linens were top notch and I slept very well and was not bothered by street noise (I was on the 4th floor). The staff was friendly although not particularly knowledgable (questions about current theatre offerings were met with blank stares). The complementary wine &amp; cheese was a nice afternoon pick me up and having the fantastic vegan restaurant Millenium sharing the lobby was a terrific plus for a before bedtime dessert &amp; beverage. The Savoy is centrally located just 2 or 3 blocks up from Union Square. However it borders the Tenderloin on the other side so I found it best to go down Geary towards Union Square before heading off to points west. All in all a very good choice with location and comfort at an unbeatable price (I stayed 4 nights for under $250)."
133,2018,Feb 24 2006	very happy	Savoy HotelI visited San Francisco this past week for the first time. We were so glad to stay at the Savoy Hotel. The room was great. The employees at the front desk were very helpful when I asked for directions. The location was terrific. The Savoy is a short walk to the cable cars and to a lot of nice restaurants. San Francisco is an incredible city to visit and part of the great memories was staying at the Savoy.
134,2018,"Feb 19 2006	Wouldn't stay here again or recommend it	My daughter and I stayed here and at first were pleasantly surprised by the charm of the old hotel; however it didn't take long to determine that our room on the second floor, at the back and overlooking a lane was going to be VERY noisy. The double hung window obviously did not close fully and an attempt at caulking the half inch gap did nothing to help keep out the street noise as well as the person who showed up each morning between 5:30 and 6:30 to hose down the lane (what goes on in that lane to warrant this clean up each morning). Also the bare hardwood floors do not help to keep out pounding feet from the room above. The shower controls looked to be the originals and did not work properly turning from ice cold to scalding hot in a second. Our last night turned cool and the heater in the room did not work. We were provided with extra blankets. The wine and cheese were a nice touch but as my daughter was under age, we did not partake. The $7.00 continental breakfast could be improved upon considerably by either offering what they serve for free ($7.00 is a lot for a bagel and an orange juice) or upgrading the choices. Most other hotels we have stayed at recently have offered a great selection from hot foods, fresh fruit, many cereals and abundant types of bread, bagels, muffins, etc. for free. We did not feel completely safe in the area at night. The hotel is located on the very fringe of the Tenderloin area and is frequented by homeless/panhandlers and sketchy looking people. All in all our stay in San Francisco was very enjoyable and was only marred by our accommodation."
135,2018,"Feb 1 2006	For those seeking total character!	Great hotel for a great weekend. Us being in our mid, late 20's we were seeking something other than the blah that chain hotels have to offer. We absolutely found it at The Savoy. Quaint lobby with antique furniture. Our room: the queen deluxe, I believe, was awesome! Canary Yellow painted walls with small subtle San Francisco quotes along the ceiling, two sets of bay windows (which, did not keep street noise out that much)Bonus: Flat panel tv hanging over our antique dresser. Another bonus: free wine and cheese from 4-6pm. We really took advantage of this perk! Simply three blocks from Union Square, it was an easy walk to shopping, eating and bars."
136,2018,"Jan 23 2006	The Savoy Hotel- Lovely and Quaint!!	My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Savoy Hotel for 5 days, 4 nights, and we could not have been happier with our choice! This was our first time to San Francisco, but the hotel was in a wonderful location! It's just a couple of blocks from Union Square, and it's also easily within walking distance of Chinatown and the Financial District. The staff was eager to please and very helpful. Anytime we had any questions they were quick to answer them, as well as give us suggestions on what we could do. Each afternoon the hotel serves complimentary wine, cheese, and crackers in the lobby which is a very nice touch. The only downside of the entire place is the size of the rooms- we were comfortable in the room, however, there is not much extra space at all. Overall, this hotel is worth every cent and I hope you like it as much as we did!!"
137,2018,"Jan 12 2006	Hotel was very charming great area good value!	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for four nights. We were nervous at first about our choice as we had never visted San Francisco and weren't sure which areas we should try to stay in. In the end we were very impressed with the character of this hotel. Our hotel room was small but very beautifully decorated, there was a big bathroom, closet, ironing board, fridge and the bedding and matresses were the most comfort I've ever experienced at a hotel. The wine and cheese was a very nice touch. The area was great, really close to shopping and many restaurants, there were quite a few homeless people around, but they did not bother us very much. San Francisco is such a beautiful city!"
138,2018,"Dec 23 2005	Would return but some issues	We stayed here on a Saturday night on the Travelzoo special, which was $75 base rate for a twin-bedded room. Since it was raining, we used the valet but did not take advantage of in/out priveleges. One can self-park in the same Jones Street garage for $20. Actually a relative &quot;bargain,&quot; but if I had a choice, I would have used public transportation rather than drive. Our room is advertised as &quot;Classic.&quot; It was small but adequate, with two comfortable twin beds, desk, a large closet with safe. The bathroom was fairly large but with virtually no counter space. A bit of mold present on the shower tiles, not overly gross. The other fixtures, bedding and carpet were clean. The biggest drawback was that the large double-hung window did not close completely, with a half-inch gap that let in cold air and street noise. Yes, it was very noisy even though we had only an alley view. The small space heater worked, but the room was drafty. We missed the happy hour and our rate did not include the breakfast. We ate breakfast at David's Deli just down the block on Geary (for nostalgia's sake). A sign in the lobby indicates the continental breakfast is available at $7 per person, I would give it a try next time. Our favorite restaurant, Mocca on Maiden Lane, across from the Frank Lloyd Wright building and Britex Fabrics. My favorite hotel amenity is a computer terminal with free internet access on the front desk. Great for tourists traveling without their laptops.We liked the Geary Street location for convenience to Union Square, Maiden Lane, galleries and theatres. I probably would not stay here for a longer trip to SF involving the typical tourist sites, Fisherman's Wharf etc, but it's great for a weekend night. Two females together, we did not feel especially unsafe since there is a lot of foot traffic on Geary, along with the ever-present panhandlers."
139,2018,Dec 21 2005	Not a must stay	We stayed at this hotel for three nights starting on December 2nd. The room was small and the positioning of the bathroom door to the head of the bead was not pleasant. If you enjoy the smell of a recently used bathroom you may enjoy it. While we were there a brand new pair of shorts went missing and we assumed that they got taken out with the linen when our room was cleaned. We asked the front desk to take a look for them on our behalf. We never heard a thing about them and were in a rush when we checked out so did not have time to follow up then.My biggest complaint with this hotel is the experience after we departed. I noticed that I had somehow forgotten (even though I double checked that I had not left anything behind) my battery charger for my digital camera. I attempted to phone their toll free number that is listed on their web site and discovered that it did not work from Calgary Canada. I then emailed them to request that they locate it as well as the missing pair of shorts on my behalf. The email was said to have been forwarded to housekeeping but I never again heard back from them even after I asked them to follow up with housekeeping.I would suggest that you keep your valuables locked up if you stay here because you may never see them again!
140,2018,"Oct 26 2005 	Funky Hotel/Great Price	Considering the prices in the Union Square area in San Francisco, the Savoy Hotel is a fabulous find. I got a price quote on Travelocity for $109 per night and was not disappointed. I needed to check-in early and had absolutely no problems doing so. My room was clean with quirky quotes painted on the walls and a mirror that said &quot;The Star of this Room&quot; with a very cool surfboard w/the map of California attached to the door. The location can't be beat; you're in walking distance of everything! And the bus line is very easy to navigate (it's only $1.50) and the nearest one is right on the corner of Jones. My meals were excellent. Dotties True Blue Cafe is right around the corner and is one restaurant that should NOT be missed. Colibri is down the street toward Union Square Market (killer mohitos) and Fino (authentic Italian) is a couple of blocks from the hotel. Also, the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the San Francisco area. Since The Savoy is an old boutique hotel it has character traits such as creaky wooden floors and a slow moving elevator. This may turn some people off, but this traveler considers it to be part of its lovely charm. Every guest I ran into seemed to agree with me."
141,2018,"Oct 9 2005 	Decent value for a decent (at best) hotel	While the prices here for staying in the Union Square area are something of a draw, after staying here you'll have a sense that you get what you pay for.We were given a room that had that old hotel scent - my wife likened the smell to a grandmother's basement - a mildew-y, old clothes smell. Now, it's quite possible that not every room has this smell, but for us, it was a certain reminder that we were in an old hotel.In addition, there was no air conditioner (!) in our top floor room, and that's a challenge when you need to open windows over busy and noisy Geary St. The bed also wasn't real comfortable with a mushy mattress and old and worn sheets. Otherwise, the rooms were very clean and perfectly servicable.Note that given the age of the hotel, there's no high speed internet connections in the rooms available. However, there's free wireless available in the lobby and mezzanine - which, by the way, are charming and generally inviting, if worn.The hotel has a nice location in that it's on the main street (Geary) in the Union Square area, just a few blocks from the Square itself. Service was friendly and helpful too.All in all, you might not have the room experience we had, and for the price, this is a decent value in the Union Square area. There's nothing here that should scare you away if you're on a real budget. But you can generally do better with similar prices at some of the other hotels in the area (check out the Kimpton or the Joie de Vivre chains, which have a few hotels in the Union Square area.)"
142,2018,"Sep 28 2005	Quirky but comfortable and cheap Savoy	Stayed at the Savoy at the beginning of Sept. Shared one of their &quot;two bedroom suites&quot; with my Mom - which worked out great. Essentially we had two separate rooms (one King, one Queen) connected by a small foyer and shared a bathroom. Good value and suited us fine.Overall I found the hotel a bit quirky - rooms were a bit old, slowest elevator in creation (easier to run up the stairs), funny quotes about SF painted on the walls, but very comfortable beds (new mattresses, nice pillows), and good value (we booked through Expedia and got about $99 US/night.The location of the hotel is near Union Square (about 4 block walk), which is convenient. But Geary is a very busy, noisy road. My Mom had the bedroom facing the street and found it very noisy. Mine was a bit quieter and I sleep like a log anyway.The staff was pretty average. Not super friendly, but polite enough. Wouldn't be my first choice for a place to stay - but I guess if you can get a good discount and want somewhere centrally located it's not bad."
143,2018,"Sep 22 2005 	AWFUL service hotel needs work	Four of my work colleagues and I stayed at the Savoy hotel on a recent business trip to San Francisco. We did quite a few searches before settling on the Savoy, based on user reviews, price, and location. I would NOT recommend this hotel to people traveling to the city, as there are a huge number of other hotels nearby. The hotel is old, and it shows in the worn carpets, incredibly slow elevator, and non-updated common areas. The whole hotel is supposed to be non-smoking, but I was originally given a room that smelled like an ashtray. It was so bad you could smell it from the hallway. I asked for a room change and the front desk was totally unhelpful and unfriendly about it. They told me they would have to move me into a twin room that ended up being just as bad--- I could hear everything on the street (cars, people talking, nearby neighbors), and the shower didn't work properly. They told me they would change my room the next day, but I had to wait until late afternoon for them to do it. After all that, they still charged me the regular room rate! The location was great, however, the service was terrible-- especially the very unfriendly front desk staff that works during key business hours. They were totally unhelpful with everything from needing to change rooms, getting taxis, and giving directions. The Millenium restaurant was worth eating at, and the service there was good. I would suggest to anyone considering this place to look elsewhere--- the city has many other (better) options!"
144,2018,"Sep 13 2005	Savov - Good Value	Found the hotel quite quaint. No A/C concerned me, but with window open, still was quiet and comfortable. We upgraded to a &quot;better&quot; room ($10 more) and thoroughly enjoyed it.The wine and cheese every night was a nice touch.Bed comfortable, bathroom clean and bright, good shower.Front desk QUITE helpful.Valet parking quick and convenient.Theatre, shopping and trolley lines within short walking distance.An excellent value."
145,2018,"Sep 7 2005	Very poor experience	My husband and I planned our trip to San Francisco months ago including hotel reservations. We had originally planned to stay at the Savoy Hotel (based on recommendations on this site and in various guidebooks) for four nights. However, about one month before our arrival date our plans changed. I notified the hotel that we needed to cancel two nights. I was given the same reservation number before ending the call.When we arrived at the hotel we discovered that our original reservation had not, in fact, been altered in the computer system and that when we did not show up the first night (of the original booking) they cancelled our room for the duration.After standing at the front desk for 15 minutes (being ignored by the second clerk) the clerk returned to inform us that the hotel was completely booked and she recommended we go elsewhere. The hotels she mentioned were all totally out of our price range so completely unhelpful. There seemed to be no recognition that this was THEIR problem to solve, not ours.We ended up staying at the Phoenix Hotel (great place with great ambience and service) which cost more (weekend rates) than the room at the Savoy and we had to alter our dinner reservation at Millennium from 7:30pm to 9:45pm so we had enough time to locate another hotel and move our luggage etc.Overall, very unpleasant/frustrating experience. We lost about 2.5 hours of our day, had to pay for parking at the Savoy while we learned they had screwed up our reservation and paid more for a hotel room than we had budgeted. Grrr."
146,2018,"Aug 24 2005	Excellent (aside from one jerk of a hotel clerk)	We stayed here a few weeks ago and found it quite charming, save for &quot;Nick&quot; at the front desk, who checked us in and was suprisingly rude. Not only was he sassy and short with us and any questions we had, but he literally scoffed at us when we explained that we had not made a reservation for the dinner special that came with our room. Besides this, the hotel was old but well kept and cozy. Our room was bright, and the bed was really comfortable. All encounters with other staff members were quite pleasant, as well. A word for the wise: Take advantage of their 2-2-2 special, which includes dinner at the attached restaurant, Millenium, continental breakfast and one night's stay for $200. It was a good deal and the restaurant is amazing. Just remember to make your dinner reservation separate from the hotel reservation. (They don't tell you always.)"
147,2018,"Aug 16 2005	Unsavory Savoy	My wife and I stayed here for one night in mid-August, booking the 2-2-2 special the Savoy advertises on their website. This package includes dinner at the Millennium restaurant (vegetarian), located in their lobby, plus an overnight stay, for $200. Considering that dinner would add up to around $75 or so, plus getting a decent room near Union Square, I thought this would be a good deal. After our experience, I'm not so sure. I always try to be fair in my writeups, and the Savoy did have several good points, but it also had some negatives to consider before booking a room:1) When we arrived, there was a sign for the valet, but no one there. My wife went inside to find someone, and they said they would call someone to pick up the car. I waited outside by the car for about 10+ minutes until I finally went inside to ask what was going on. The clerk responded that their offered parking and valet service was through a garage around the corner, and that he had called someone to come over from there to get the car. He also warned me that prior guests had been ticketed and that the SF police would tow a car parked outside the hotel during afternoon rush hours. So he suggested that I drive around the block a few times while we waited for the valet to appear. I was surprised by this disorganization, but decided to wait a few more minutes by the car instead. When no one appeared after several more minutes, I finally got in the car and drove it to the garage around the corner myself. The attendant was surprised to see me, and said he was just sending someone over to the hotel to get the car. 2) The room we received was decidedly European in its character. By that, I mean cozy, but nice and well-appointed. The double pane windows helped screen out much of the street noise, even on a lower floor (3rd) and the ceiling and walls were decorated with whimsical pictures and entertaining quotes. The bathroom was a little dated, but all in all, it appeared to be a pretty decent room. However, upon closer inspection as we were getting ready, the drain in the tub seemed to have standing water inside it. When I pulled up the stopper to see if there was a clog, there was a fairly thick clump of long brown hair attached. And the water was still there, so there must have been a good deal more of it down the drain a bit. It didn't look like this tub had been thoroughly cleaned for awhile, and my wife was not about to take a bath in it after seeing that.3) Twice during the night we were awakened by a screeching sound in the pipes just below our room floor. I still don't know what caused this horrible sound, but it threw us bolt upright twice from a dead sleep, once around 12:30 AM and once around 2:30 AM. It lasted only about 5 or 6 seconds in all, but it was a startling and very unpleasant experience. Twice. If we hadn't been so dead tired and not wanting to pack up, I would have requested another room immediately. I wanted to like this place, and from surface appearances, it looks like a nice place and a good value. We really enjoyed the Millennium restaurant, but the hotel was disappointing. The drain situation was somewhat offputting, but even then, the stay would have been alright, except for the shrieking sound of the pipes. The front desk was too busy the next morning to worry much about our problems, so I just wrote the whole thing off as a learning experience. As you might imagine, I just can't endorse this hotel to others, as we may dine there again, but will probably not be staying there."
148,2018,"Aug 14 2005	Cute Boutique Hotel Good Visitor Location Few Drawbacks	We stayed here for 5 nights last week and REALLY LIKED this hotel! Front desk staff were friendly enough - not what one would call &quot;southern friendly,&quot; but it's not the south, and they certainly weren't rude. The daily wine/cheese hour was a really nice touch - you can grab a plate of fruit, cheese, and crackers and a glass of wine on your way up to your room after an afternoon of touring the city. The decor throughout is lovely - trendy meets traditional, modern and obviously updated in the last few years or so. The room rate was great (room was a little small in size, but plenty big for the two of us, and VERY comfortable). Now, as much as I love this hotel, in fairness to potential visitors reading these reviews, I can only give it 3 stars, because there were some drawbacks: (1) no internet service in the room, only lobby (but it was free); (2) toilet didn't work quite right first day, but my husband was able to fix it; (3) no air conditioning, but with San Fran weather, open windows made for perfect room temperature (and there is a ceiling fan), but keep this in mind and request a high floor because it is near a sketchy part of town, and open windows at night gave us an occassional earful of noisy nighttime activity (most nights we were exhausted though, from walking the hilly city, so we slept fine; we were on 6th floor out of seven); (4) when we checked in, I needed to cancel one night of our reservation, and I could tell that the desk clerk was not paying full attention when I mentioned the cancelation; so on the sheet where I had to sign off on the room rate, I also wrote &quot;cancel Aug 16.&quot; When we checked out on Aug. 13, I asked the (different) desk clerk to confirm that the Aug 16 night had been cancelled, and it had not been. I had her pull the sheet where I had written on it, so she would know we gave timely notice, and she said she would take care of it; (5) elevator takes a long time - take the stairs going down even from top floors; (6) no response to my email before the trip, asking for confirmation of our reservation, which I sent to the email address shown on their website (and I booked through the hotel website) - I called and only got verbal confirmation). As for view from the room, there's nothing nearby to have a great view of, and that didn't matter to us on this trip and doesn't affect my rating of the hotel. All of that being said, some of these things would be the case with any number of hotels in old buildings in a large city; and the hotel really has NICE character, which is what we like in a hotel. If you want luxury, you can pay twice as much and get it down the street. For comfort and a good &quot;getting around town&quot; location for a visitor, I don't think there's a better value in San Francisco!"
149,2018,"Aug 9 2005	Good Enough	Stayed for 3 nights - couple with 2 teenagersYou get what you pay for - clean comfortable rooms - just big enough- friendly staff though not many of them- generally good knowledgeable service- blocked sink took a day to fix- no aircon, view, lounge- good location- breakfast rubbish - go across the street which is excellent"
150,2018,"Aug 6 2005	Savoy was poor value with service problems	I was staying in San Francisco at the same time a few people I had just met were, and they were all paying significantly (30- 50%) less at their hotels than I was at the Savoy. My room at the Savoy was bigger than theirs, but we were all staying in the same (slightly sleazy--many bums, prostitutes and massage parlors) area around Union Square. Note, the &quot;city-view&quot; rooms the Savoy offers for slightly more on the phone just mean you can see the bums, prostitutes and massage parlors from your room. There's much bettter value than the Savoy.Also, while the people working there were nice enough, the actual service I got had some serious problems. The voicemail in my room didn't work, and they never fixed it or got back to me when I reported it. The towel rack in my room was broken, and twisted away from the wall the first time I put a towel on it. A note left by two of my friends at the front desk was never given to me, and to make it worse, they gave the note to somebody who knew me that came in off the street. Now, in this case, it was a friend, so no harm done. But the idea they gave a note for me to somebody who came in off the street is such a violation of trust. Also, a couple of times they sent visitors upstairs to see if I was in my room, rather than calling up. Given the sleazy neighborhood, I'd want to see a lot better security.Not a horrible place, but you can do a lot better. Go somewhere else."
151,2018,"Jun 29 2005	Lovely little hotel	This hotel was a great one!!!! It was pretty cheap, considering the location. Right downtown. The rooms were small, but CLEAN, and the bathroom was small, but CLEAN... but really, how much time do you end up staying in your hotel on your trip???!!! Had wine &amp; cheese hour... not too bad, and they give you some complimentary fruit &amp; chocolate after your first night.... Would love to stay again, no problems whatsoever!!!"
152,2018,"Jun 28 2005	Good and Bad	This hotel is between a great neighborhood and an unsavory one. Because of our short one-night stay, we didn't walk outside and don't know if it would have been a problem. The restaurant, all vegan, is absolutely excellent as was the service. The rooms, which were small, as to be expected in a hotel in a large downtown, were very charming, attractive and comfortable. However, 1) No one offered to help us with our luggage on arrival and 2) the same desk clerk was uncommunicative, unwelcoming, and unhelpful on both arrival and departure. (6/23 and 6/24/05)"
153,2018,"Jun 17 2005	Don't stay at the Savoy Hotel on Geary	My husband and I just returned from a short business trip to San Francisco. We stayed at the Savoy Hotel for 3 nights. The first room they put us in had mould growing in the shower and the carpet was filthy. They begrudgingly changed our room. This room had a toilet-full of something and when we tried to flush it, the toilet overflowed all over the floor. We phoned the front desk and they sent someone up to plunge it. We had to beg them to wash the floor and give us new towels or a new room, but they said the hotel was full. The carpets were also filthy and there was not chair in the room, or anywhere to sit except the bed. We booked this over the internet, and their write-up said that the hotel had been completely redone - Parisienne style. Not so! We just didn't feel the room was clean, and it wasn't. On the up-side, the afternoon wine and cheese was good, we took a plateful of cheese and grapes back to our room, and 2 glasses of wine, which was not too bad. We were very glad to leave and we will not be going back to this hotel - ever!"
154,2018,"Jun 13 2005	What a disappointment!	When we arrived at the Savoy, we were given a very small room (the smallest I have ever stayed in, including the much much cheaper Motel 6 and such). There was just enough space to get around the bed. The window looked out onto a wall ten feet away. The steet noise kept us awake much of the night, even though we were on the seventh floor! The bathroom was also very small, and the water in the shower changed temperature constantly. The location was pretty good (although at the edge of Union Square). However, many hotels in that area probably do a better job in room design and upkeep. Ultimately, our Savoy experience rated low on comfort."
155,2018,"May 25 2005	The Savoy Hotel is Wonderful!	My 8 year old son and I stayed at the Savoy Hotel in March, 2005. From the time we walked in until the time we left, we were treated wonderfully. The staff was professional from the manager to the cleaning people. There were video games available for my son in the room - which he was more than happy about - me too, and the room was perfect for our stay. The room was bright and homey. All of our needs were taken care of in a timely manner and I'd recommend this hotel to EVERYONE. The only downside is because it's located in downtown San Francisco, it can be a little noisy - bring earplugs - they made a real difference. Enjoy!"
156,2018,"Apr 22 2005	Lovely hotel	We moved to this hotel after spending a horrendous night at the Travelodge a couple of blocks away. The room was very comfortable and well decorated, and felt luxurious compared with the Travelodge even though it was not much more expensive. Staying here made our trip to San Francisco a wonderful experience."
157,2018,"Apr 15 2005 	For tourists with more Euros than taste - in a word ""Yuck""	So sad...The Savoy had been a family secret. Ideal location, great value and, while not the most modern of facilities, agreeable to the eye with its French provincial/Bistro feel and especially pleasing to the pocketbook. We had stayed here many times, but not since the chain Joie de Vivre had sold it.It was with much (unfortunately justified) trepidation that I booked what was to be my last stay there. The changes were apparent the instant I walked in the door. &quot;Free Tequila shot upon registration&quot; the sign next to the cheap tequila declared. Upon walking into our room, the first thing I saw was a mirror with a little brass sign &quot;YOU are the star!&quot; Across from it, a mini-surfboard with a map of California on it. And there... in the same room containing the stodgy, tired old world furniture, were photographs of surfers, and pseudo-famous quotes about California written on the walls. Whoever decorated these rooms is completely colorblind! Colors clashed with each other, and old furniture competed (believe me, I do enjoy eclectic styles, but this was beyond redemption) with bedspreads not even the Salvation Army would accept and some kind of turf-like carpeting, all encompassed in rooms with walls painted screaming yellow and vivid pistachio green. Yeow!The Savoy still has many excellent qualities. Its location is unbeatable if you wish to be near Union Square. The staff is responsive, friendly and extremely helpful. The price is still good (though I will be happy to pay a few dollars more to stay elsewhere... and heaven knows, San Francisco has so many excellent choices). They still offer free wine, cheese and fruit to their guests between 5 and 6pm. The old bistro-style restaurant has been replaced with a hip and extremely successful Vegan restaurant... Millenium.Other things to keep in mind... the windows are not double-paned, so even on the 5th floor, the noisy street sounds are ever-present. Joie de Vivre has opened a new hotel just a few doors down that will probably be my San Francisco home-away-from-home from now on: the gorgeous Adagio."
158,2018,"Apr 14 2005	Online Reservation	Beware of booking online. You will not receive a confirmation email. Since I did not receive an email confirming my reservation, I booked elsewhere and was charged a no show fee. Shame on me but shame on Savoy Hotel for not providing a simple service such as a confirmation email as all other hotels I've booked around the world do."
159,2018,"Apr 12 2005 	Quaint! Newly renovated with old world feel.	Clean historic hotel that can fit most budgets. A big plus: our queen size bed had soft, egyptian cotton sheets, and fluffy pillows. Tasty vegetarian restaurant attached to hotel. I also enjoyed their daily wine and cheese hour. The minuses: Offers only valet parking, which is expensive and requires lots of tipping. No high-speed internet in rooms yet."
160,2018,"Mar 17 2005	Shabby Genteel	Stayed at the Savoy Hotel February 2005. We got a great deal through a travel web-site buying the airfare and room together. The hotel is in a good location but a couple of blocks over you're in The Tenderloin, one of San Francisco's more unsavory neighborhoods. If you are walking to the Muni Metro/Bart station, I'd walk down to Union Square and forget walking down Jones. The room was small but the bed was comfortable. There was still a little bit of trash in the wastebasket in the bathroom when we arrived, also there was a bottle of Neutrogena Facial Soap on the sink that said $10.00 and it had already been opened - we advised the desk clerk and we weren't charged for it. The shower head was too low so you had to dunk down to get the shampoo out of your hair, and the hot/cold was touchy. They advertise that you get a tequila shot when you arrive but we didn't see any. Have cheese and cheap wine set out for &quot;happy hour&quot;. We found a few pieces of fruit in our room one night with a thank you note for being their guest. The hotel can be noisy at night with all the commotion on Geary. Still, would stay there again. It was charming."
161,2018,"Mar 7 2005	Loved the location and the BED!!	My husband and I flew into SFO and stayed here at the Savoy for 2 days before we drove down the California coast to LAX and Vegas. The start of our trip was great. The front desk staff were very helpful and the room was clean but small. We asked if they had a corner room liike in their ad and we were lucky-there was. The bed was absolutely awesome. This hotel is an older hotel and it reflected in the bathroom, but it was very clean and beautiful. The only downside was the day we arrived, we were in our 1st room for about 15minutes were my husband changed his shoes and put them under the bed. When we changed rooms, he forgot his shoes and about 30 minutes later, he went back to get them in the original room and lo and behold they were gone. The desk staff said no one seen them, but I suppose it was our mistake in the first place. Not going to cry over spilled milk, although if they were my shoes, I would be REALLY upset. Needless to say, we did not want to let it spoil our vacation. The location is great. We walked everywhere. The front desk staff recommended Cafe Espresso for breakfast or lunch and let me tell you...it was fantastic. I would go back just for that. So all in all, I would recommend this hotel for location, cleanliness, helpful staff and most of all the BED!!!"
162,2018,"Jan 4 2005	Love the Savoy -- again!	Spent New Year's in San Francisco at the Savoy for a second year in a row. The standard room I had requested wasn't available upon check-in, so I received a very nice upgrade to a two-bedroom suite on the second floor. The high ceilings and square footage of the rooms made it a little difficult to keep them properly heated, but otherwise everything was very pleasant: the feather bed was so comfortable, it really made it difficult not to want to sleep in very late. The double-paned windows kept out most of the traffic noises from Geary Street -- you'd only really need earplugs if you were hyper-sensitive to noise or just fresh off a farm. The bath robes are a fun perk, and I had no problem with water pressure. It took about thirty-seconds to get the hot water going, but once it got hot, it stayed hot. The breakfast in the Millennium restaurant space is a better value than it was: the price is now $5 (I think it was $8 on my last visit) for selections of cereals, juices, yogurt, and muffins/croissants. And, of course, the wine and cheese reception is a really nice touch."
163,2018,"Dec 14 2004	Savoy greatly improved	We stayed at the Savoy Dec. 10-12 2004, we were leary having read the negative reviews, but found there had been many changes. Our room was freshly painted, with new sofa and chair in our junior suite. The feather bed was wonderful, like sleeping in a cloud. New double paned windows greatly reduced any street noise. The staff was wonderful and quick to fill any requests. We enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese in the afternoon. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in downtown San Francisco amid the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season. Before I forget, for a full American breakfast you can't go wrong with the Olympic Cafe across the street, they serve amazing omlettes."
164,2018,"Oct 12 2004	good location not so good for the senses	Spent two nights here in a suite over the weekend. The location is great and the staff seemed very agreeable, but the accommodations were so-so. The place shows its age; floors creak, ceilings feature interesting stains, and the shower ran alternately hot and cold. A little harder to bear were the off-putting smells (there seemed to be a sewage problem somewhere in the vicinity) and high noise level from the street at night. Plan to bring earplugs if you go."
165,2018,"Oct 9 2004	Great location and good value	We stayed in the Savoy for four nights in September 2004 during our two week holiday in California. I had a good rate of $99 for a delux room, and it was well worth it. The hotel is not a chain, so you always expect some degree of quirkiness - but the bed was very comfortable, and the room perfectly adequate from a size point of view (when you are on holiday how much time do you spend in your room anyway?!!). Its in a great location - I can totally recommend the Olympic Cafe across the road for breakfast - fantastic omlettes! We also walked to Fisherman's Wharf from there - takes about 25 minutes but perfectly do-able. I would agree with the point made about the lift being incredibly slow (not helped by people on the 2nd and 3rd floors catching it - WALK! its better for you and the environment!!) - we were on the 7th floor and only used it when we had our luggage.I would recommend this both on price and not being a chain hotel!!"
166,2018,"Oct 7 2004	Dirtiest Most Worn down place I've ever been in!	This is one of the worst hotels I've ever been in! We booked through Orbitz and apparently it is their policy that if you book through any of the online booking agents other than The Savoy itself they give you the worst room they can find. The desk clerk actually admitted this to us! We were given a room with a hole in the ceiling caused by water damage. The bathroom had urine on the seat, hair on the sink and windowsill, and some sort of dirt on the bottom of the shower. There was a very unusual lump in the middle of the bed and the bedding had definitely seen better days. Not to mention the smell in this place was horrific! It smelled like a nursing home mixed with a men's urinal. ICK! There were stains all over the carpet and the walls were paper thin. We could hear the people next to us having a conversation in normal tones. It wasn't even like they were yelling. The room was the equivalent of a closet. We had a bigger room aboard a cruise ship and that's not saying much. The doors do not have proper locking systems and our door didn't even fit properly into the frame so all the light from the hall spilled in around the door frame. There are no chains or deadbolts on the door even though the entrance into the alleyway was left unsecured. I don't know how this hotel got a 3 star rating. It was absolutely filthy and disgusting. Everything in it was old, worn out, and improperly installed. We ended up leaving after a few hours there and letting them keep our one night deposit. The staff was less than helpful. The front desk saw no problem with giving a customer a room with urine all over the bathroom and a hole in the ceiling. From the sound of the couple next door's discussion, they were disgusted too. Everyone in my party ended up checking out of their rooms too since none of the rooms were any cleaner or safer. We ended up getting a cheaper room at the Courtyard hotel. They gave us a better rate, the staff was friendly, and the room was easily three times the size of the Savoy rooms. Plus we didn't have to endure any urine, hair, or holes in the ceiling."
167,2018,"Sep 24 2004	Nice Hotel	The only thing wrong with this place is that it's on a very noisy street. We stayed on a Saturday night, so it may have been a bit noisier than other nights. I would recommend requesting a room facing away from the street - probably a good idea with any hotel, or take ear-plugs if you sleep lightly.The staff were great though, and the free wine and cheese in the early evening was a nice touch. The room was really nicely decorated, and have no other complaints except for the noise.Breakfast was croissants, juice and cereal. Recommended."
168,2018,"Sep 8 2004	Great Value	Friday-Saturday, August 27-28, 2004Standard room = $99/night, Deluxe corner room = $114.I upgraded to the deluxe without seeing the standard, just based on reviews I had read about it being bigger, etc.The location is very convenient to public transportation and Union Square. I even walked down to the Embarcadero/Pier 7 from the hotel - not close but do-able. It's within blocks of the Tenderloin but if you avoid anything west of Leavenworth St. at night, it's a fine part of town. Geary St. has several hotels, restaurants, etc. and takes you right to Union Square/Powell St. (5 min. walk). If you do take BART into the city, walk straight up Powell or Stockton and turn left on Geary to avoid the sketchier streets southwest of the hotel. The feather bed was very comfortable, the room was well-furnished, the bathroom was spotless and our towels and soaps were replaced (not sure why the other reviewer had a problem).Anything beyond network television comes for a charge. 2 year old cable shows will cost you! Alot! The music and music video feature on the TV is also VERY expensive. Luckily I wasn't in S.F. to watch TV and the deluxe room comes with a CD player.Overall, I was very happy with my room, the hotel, and the neighborhood. This is a great deal and very convenient for travelling in the city and taking BART to the East Bay.I would definitely recommend this hotel and at this great rate will stay here again."

2,2026,"Oct 31 2009 	Sad to see it go	Stayed at the Cathedral Hill the beginning and end of a trip to the West Coast. Hotel well situated and well serviced. It's the last week of being a hotel though so everything slowly closing - gift shop, restaurant etc. Amazed that the staff were so helpful and obliging - it's now going to become a hospital."
3,2026,Oct 20 2009	Stay somewhere else	Although the Hotel staff is nice the entire place is run down. We were told the hotel would be closing and either torn down or turned into a hospital. The rooms were kept clean but rugs were sstained and thee was a coffe pot in the room but n refrigerator. in order to avoid walking up a ramp to get into the hotel you would have to walk through the garage to get the elevator to take you to the lobby. The only good thing this place has going for it is the location since there are a few different bus lines within a 2 block radius.
4,2026,"Oct 13 2009 	Great hotel for the money!	We had booked 2 rooms for the week. We checked in &amp; were given 2 rooms next to each other with an adjoining door - which was a nice touch. Rooms were bright &amp; spacious and bathrooms functional and clean. There was a coffee-filter machine which we didn't use, and an iron &amp; board in the cupboard. Internet was also available in the room. I even ventured into the pool which was quiet &amp; the area around it was clean too.I'd read mixed reviews prior to booking but decided to do it anyway. It turned out to be a really nice place to stay. Yes, it's right on the edge of a dodgey area, but we walked through it to get to/from Union Square and felt safe. Taxis are dirt-cheap though, so it's just as easy. There's also a good diner across the road (Mels) for breakfast.I understand the hotel is being demolised to make way for a new hospital soon, but there was no evidence of the hotel being run down. Staff were helpful, all the lifts worked, everywhere was clean &amp; tidy. Yes, it could have done with a freshen up and a lick of paint, but if you want 5-star accomodation then pay for a 5-star hotel! I'd definately return."
5,2026,"Oct 5 2009 	Nice hotel old but clean.	I quite liked this hotel, though we did get a free upgrade to a suite, so that probably influenced my opinion. The suite was HUGE! It had a bedroom with bed, TV, loveseat, and bathroom; then another, bigger room with a couch, 2 armchairs, a dining table that seated 6, a side table with barstool, a kitchenette, and another bathroom. Obviously the hotel is old and had some wear and tear (there was a big dent in the bathroom door for example) but seemed clean. You can hear the noise from the street, especially if the curtains are open. Honestly though, with the curtains closed, it wasn't enough noise to interfere with sleeping.Overall I thought it was a good hotel, no problems with service.Parking was I think $22/night, self-parking, not valet (which is a plus in my opinion). The parking lot is directly underneath the hotel."
6,2026,Sep 27 2009 	Grotty but Adequate	This hotel appeared to be one of the few left with rooms during the dates of my business trip. check-in was quick but a bit odd as they only had us down for one room when we had booked two through getaroom.com. They managed to find us another room and we were both booked into exterior rooms on the 4th floor. I found the room noisy with traffic outside and noise leakage from the room next door but it seemed clean enough and the bed was comfy.The rooms had a bit of a residential home smell and wasn't well cleaned by housekeeping - old soap etc. For the price though and the location the hotel suited our needs. It also had a sense of faded glamour and is right next door to Tomy's Joynt where I had an amazing late night dinner.Friendly front desk staff and concierge that are let down by how dilapidated the hotel has become. I understand that it will be closing in October.
7,2026,"Sep 27 2009 	Very Pleasant Stay	The room was very comfortable. A bit on the tight side between the foot of the bed and the TV cabinet, but the desk/sitting area was quite adequate. The room was clean and kept that way for the balance of my three-night stay. The wireless Internet is with AT&amp;T, so my access was free as an AT&amp;T wireless customer. The speed was fine and very consistent.I didn't eat in the Jack Tar restaurant, but the menu looked pretty good and reasonably priced as downtown hotel restaurants go. I hate to eat alone in restaurants (all that waiting with no one to talk to) so I opted for sandwiches from the Van Ness Bakery &amp; Cafe just across the street. They made me a killer egg salad sandwich the first night. The next two nights I had their vegetarian sandwich. Both types of sandwiches came with very tasty french fries, and at about $5 a sandwich - quite a bargain.I peeked into Tommy's Joynt which was just next door. It looked like a fun place, but was crowded and more of a hang with friends kind of place. According to one of my bosses, there are some excellent restaurants with a couple of blocks, but I didn't check them out."
8,2026,Sep 23 2009 	Think twice before staying here and only if saving money is a concern.	Located on the edge of a rough neighbourhood (The Tenderloin).Might not be safe to be on foot near the hotel late at night.The room could barely be considered clean - lots of strange stains on the carpet.No Internet of any kind.The staff was not very friendly or helpful. I only stayed here because it was part of a very inexpensive flight/hotel deal I got on Expedia.
9,2026,"Sep 8 2009 	great room for the location and money	we have stayed at the cathedral hotel numerous times because it is in a great location for our needs. it is clean, the staff is friendly and it is a great room for the money. this last stay there were problems with the elevators and they were working diligently to get the problem fixed."
10,2026,"Sep 1 2009 	could have been more	hotel was rather nice inside. clean. front desk at check-in could have been more pleasant but i've gotten use to the lack, or requirement of social skills, courtesy. room was small, noisey and on the street side, didn't sleep much. next time i'll request courtside if i choose this hotel again?. parking 20 bucks extra, no continental breakfast unless you buy. no room, parking-breakfast deal which would have been nice. most likely will try another hotel next time since they don't offer anything specials the others don't..."
11,2026,"Aug 29 2009 	Beware of Bedbugs	The hotel room itself is spacious, especially for San Francisco. The furnishings in the room were old and tattered but looked clean. However, everyone in my party woke up with numerous bed bug bites. We spend the next few days itching like crazy.On each day of my four day stay, the hallway was littered with half-eaten room service plates. The cleaning service cleaned them once a day. Spend your money elsewhere."
12,2026,"Aug 17 2009 	What a dump!	Skip this hotel. Dirty, broken, rude. The hotel is run down and everything from the front counter to the halls to the room interior is dirty, scuffed and in need of cleaning. The heater/AC unit was broken or perhaps always inoperable requiring 2 visits from their handyman to disassemble it - one to turn it on and one to turn it off . With one thin blanket on the bed (no others in the closet) some heat was needed. The front desk advised that &quot;your body heat will naturally warm the room&quot; before agreeing to send someone to look at it. That's just ridiculous! The room was on the patio level so it had a sliding glass door (eventually managed to get that locked with an odd device that seemed to be circa 1950) so opening a window for ventilation when the heater would not shut off was impossible.The room was sad. Peeling wallpaper covered with drips and splatters of unknown origin, grubby bathroom, hand prints on the door. A little TLC would go a long way in this place.The TV buzzed loudly on every channel making it unusable."
13,2026,"Aug 16 2009 	Functional not fancy reasonable price adequate parking	Nothing fancy here. But if you are loking for a good hotel at a reasonable price and adequate parking in San Francisco this hotel may be for you. I stay here for its proximity for my business purposes and its reasonable parking. It is not within reasonable or safe walking distance to shopping or major tourist attractions. The street side rooms are very small. For comfort I recommend the garden view rooms. The room size and quiteness are worth the few extra dollars. The parking garage may look scary, it is not. Pleanty of parking spaces at a resonable rate for San Francisco.If you are looking for a good overnight or couple of days stay along the Van Ness Aveneue corrider this is really an okay place. Functional but no &quot;wow&quot; factor. You may likely return. If it is your first and likely only visit to San Francisco I would suggest you stay close to the toursit attractions. You will not enjoy the total San Francisco experience from this hotel. For repeat business customers familiar with the city this is a convenent place to stay."
14,2026,"Aug 16 2009 	The easiest place to stay in S.F.!""	Cathedral Hill is the perfect place to stay in S.F. The staff is fabulous! They know the city inside and out. They make public transportation totally do-able. The restaurants in walking distance have excellent food reasonably priced. Jimmy's Deli is across the street and has an incredible bar and outstanding pastrami and turkey! The Carousel has superb Chinese food. The movie theater is across the street. How convenient is that? The bus to ANYWHERE and EVERYWHERE can be caught across the street. The bakery across the street is open 24 hours a day. It's only a 10 min. bus ride to an Irish coffee at the Buena Vista! There's an Enterprise Car Rental place in the garage. You can get parking and a wonderful buffet breakfast with your room. You just can't been staying at the Cathedral Hill Hotel!"
15,2026,"Aug 10 2009 	I would stay here again if i could get the same deal!	i booked the room through the hotel website. i thought i was getting a pretty good deal for booking the room so far in advance. a few weeks before the trip i decided to look on expedia to see what the room was going for. they had the same room for $80.00! i called to cancel the reserevation and book it through expedia, insead of the hassle the hotel honored the price expedia quoted...kuddos to that!The hotel was in a nice clean area and the hotel staff was friendly. we had ordered some extra towels and it took awhile for them to be delivered. so long in fact that we called back. they were later delivered by what appeared to be the maintance man. Parking was expensive but secure.Next door was the most amazing bar named Tommy's Joynt. i would stay here again just to be close to that bar, voted cheapest drinks in town and the food was great! not your typical &quot;bar food&quot;."
16,2026,"Aug 5 2009 	So-so room in scary neiborhood	The main thing about this hotel is that it is in the heart of the worst part of the city. We felt unsafe walking there, even in daylight. The room was badly desinged, having only one light in the bathroom over the sink, leaving the sohwer completely in the dark! The walls were clearly made of some kind of cheap material that covered an old dirty wall that we could see in the corners.The windows did not block ANY sound from outside, so we kept waking un each time a bum shouted out loud. Don't go there, it is a fake luxury place. Don't trust the pictures on the web site."
17,2026,"Aug 2 2009 	Crappy Hotel	OK - this is unbelievable There was a older man using the pool patio as a toliet on Friday late afternoon. On Saturday night, there was a bag of human feces in the elevator lobby in the parking garage. the hotel is suppose to close in a couple of months to be imploded to make way for a new hospital - looks like no one is paying attention to the property. From our 7th floor balcony room we saw boarded up hotel windows. A little girl got caught in the elevator while we there. The bathroom showers is gross and the vent in the bathroom was caked with dust, etc. Our coffee cups were even dirty. the place is gross and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. they might want to think about closing it now or getting a cleaning crew and some security!"
18,2026,"Jul 29 2009 	A good deal	We were welcomed with efficiency and all the information we needed to make our stay a pleasent one. The hotel is bright and cheery, the rooms are neat and comfortable. The corridors are a little tired and in need of a bit of TLC. Great coffee shop, good value. Fantastic diner (Mel's) across the road that does excellent food, all day. Milkshakes are fab. The pool was a lovely extra, great to relax in after a hard day sight seeing. I would recommend the hotel and use it again."
19,2026,"Jul 28 2009 	Older Hotel	Okay place to stay, but beware of the fee to park your car...$20.00 a day. We did not see this when we booked online. The air-conditioning does not work the best very old. Be patient with the elevators they do not always stop where they are suppose to. I think you can find nicer hotels in the area. There are also fees to use the internet."
20,2026,"Jul 21 2009 	Recommended classy but not snobby friendly and helpful good price.	Staff was very helpful and accomodating. Classy but not snobby. The rooms were well apportined though not overly spacious, comfortable beds and good pillows. The bathroom was recently remodeled with nice fixtures, housekeeping met all expectations. Direct access to the parking garage. We were on motorcycles, parking was $4.00 per bike (cheap). I think cars were $15 or $20 per night. We did not eat or drink in the hotel, but there was a restaurant and a bar, and the prices seemed reasonable for S.F. (we're from Idaho so they seemed a little high to us). Great location across from Tommy's Joynt on Van Ness and Geary. (Eat there if you enjoy a funky, eclectic place with home made food - turkey, roast, etc. carved right in front of you as you order.) The hotel is kitty-corner from a Mel's Drive Inn (not the original but still has fun '50's atmosphere and a great clam chowder in a breadbowl).I would definitely stay there again."
21,2026,"Jul 21 2009 	A comfortable affordable hotel with a friendly staff.	We were happy to be in a hotel that was central to all the transportation needs to get around San Francisco, as it is located on the corner of Geary and Van Ness. This put us within an easy walk of all the bus stops going both North/South and East/West. We had planned this trip to take in the King Tut exhibit at the De Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, and the location of the hotel was great, as we never used our car after checking in. The hotel staff was very friendly and courteous, welcoming any inguiries with a smile and lots of help, as well as hand-out maps that were easy to follow. We think the way to experience San Francisco is to travel with the residents (mass transit) and walk the neighborhoods, and this was easy from this location. The room itself was not large, but very clean and tidy, with an excellent (firm) mattressed bed. The hotel has a snack/coffee shop that was very reasonable. There was a pool and large pool area within the three sides of the hotel, as well as a small work-out room with treadmills, exercise bikes, and a few weight machines."
22,2026,"Jul 20 2009 	This hotel needs a remodel very baddly	Dirty, old, loud, no ventilation, old bedding, carpets stained, smelled like old cigarette smoke, no openalbe window and the funky old air conditioner didnt work. I rate this place a 1"
23,2026,"Jul 15 2009 	Not a bad hotel Not a good area!	My husband and I stayed at the &quot;Cathedral Hill Hotel&quot; while vacationing in San Francisco for the weekend. I originally chose the hotel because of its down town location, price and swimming pool. (Not a lot of down town hotels have pools) The hotel is located in a bad area of town. Lots of drunks and transients roam the premises. The outside of the hotel is old and weathered but pleasant and clean in the lobby. The staff was pleasant and helpful. I had reserved a pool side room but was given a street view room. We called the front desk and were moved to a pool side room right away. The rooms were clean and well stocked. The hotel is located right on a bus line and about a mile from Union square. Although the hotel sits on a sketchy street we were happy with the service, the room and the pool. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the city for a decent price."
24,2026,"Jul 13 2009 	Old 1 1/2 Star w/ Hidden Cost	I arrived on 7/3/09. It was difficult to get to the driveway so I parked in the garage on bottom floor. I saw another hotel guest pushing the luggage cart so right off the bat I knew that customer service was going to be scarce. The area by the elevators in the garage had an overflowing trash can and the elevator took a full ten minutes to reach the bottom floor. One of the elevators was being worked on. When I finally arrived in the lobby area there were ten people in line and only one clerk. Once in line I found out there is an additional $20 a night fee for the car and another $10 a night for the internet. I received my room key and went up to the eight floor to get settled in my room. Unfortunately the key the front desk person gave me did not open the room door. So I had to carry my luggage back downstairs to get a key that worked. Once I was finally in the room I was not impressed with the cleanliness. The carpet was old, discolored, and the room had an old building smell about it. I opened the sliding door and was disappointed with the lanai area. Lots of stains on the ground and the whole area just felt dirty. After settling I was awakened @ 3am by my neighbors arriving home. The walls are that thin.The staff that I did meet was cordial but there were too few and none really servicing the customers other than the front desk people. The luggage guys just stand around and don't really offer any type of assistance unless you ask them directly.Overall I had issues with the cleanliness, the service, and old building smell of the rooms.Thank you,Victoria M. Flournoy"
25,2026,"Jul 10 2009 	No complaints	We stayed two nights and don't have any complaints. We were worried before getting there after reading some of the reviews, but found their complaints unwarranted. (I don't think some people will ever be happy.)The rate we got, directly from the hotel's website, was excellent, especially for San Franciso. The staff was polite. In fact, the housekeeping staff was probably the most friendliest we have seen anywhere. Our room, and the rest of the hotel that we saw, was clean. No, it isn't the newest hotel around. It is showing some wear and tear, but so are we. No, it isn't the swankiest hotel around. But, as someone else said, it is a great base. Bus lines going different directions are easily accessible. We walked to Fisherman's Wharf, via China Town, and North Beach and took the bus back. We took the bus to Golden Gate Park and later to Orpheum Theater (and walked back from the later). All with ease.We did not eat in the hotel restaurant, but did grab a quick breakfast from the coffee shop/bakery in the hotel and had lunch at Tommy's across the street, as well as venturing out into the city. We were happy with all of our meals.We also did not swim, but there were some people swimming. San Francisco's weather is a little chilly for us to swim in, but we are also from the valley where it is much warmer.We had a very pleasant stay and would return."
26,2026,"Jul 10 2009 	Despite the negative reviews I was pleasantly surprised	My reservation had been made for me and, after reading some of the reviews on-line, I wondered if I would enjoy my stay. I did. My room was clean and comfortable, facing the inside courtyard and pool, with little traffic noise. All the staff I encountered were pleasant and helpful, particularly the house-keeping and Jack Tar staff. The hotel's location is great and San Francisco's public transit system cheap and efficient. The hotel is not luxurious, but it is comfortable and the price is certainly right .... $65 a night for a king room, in downtown San Francisco ? I would certainly stay there again."
27,2026,"Jul 8 2009 	Great place friendly staff	I went for a second time this year. Once for Easter and the second time at the end of June.It's a nice hotel, very clean, comfortable beds, friendly staff and placed in one of the main streets of the city, near the City Hall, the Opera, the Civic Center and many other interesting places. It is a quiet place at night and in a safe area. I did not use the restaurant inside the hotel, instead I went to Mel's which is a diner across the street. There you can enjoy nice food in the 50's atmosphere. If you come by plane and you want to safe some money, you can take the Bart from the airport (around $5.30) to the Civic Center and walk a little bit to Van Ness street. Bus # 47 will take you straight to the hotel."
28,2026,"Jul 8 2009 	Thanks for a great stay	Hotel was clean, spacious and well equipted. Check in was easy. People were friendly and courteous. Constantly offered help and asked if they could do anything else. Parking was convenient and cheap for downtown San Fran and allowed unlimited in and out. Did say pool was heated but way too cold to swim. Thanks for a nice stay."
29,2026,"Jun 22 2009 	Satisfactory - No issues	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for four nights from 4th -8th June 2009. Our stay was part of a three centre holiday package and in truth we are not fully aware as to what we actually paid for our stay given the cost would be a part of the whole deal.Therefore I cannot report on the issue of 'value for money' but only on how we found the hotel as a place to stay.I was concerned regarding some of the previous reviews and I now believe it is all a matter of personal standards. We found this hotel to be satisfactory. It is an average (UK standard) three star hotel and it furnishings reflect this.Our room was comfortable; the bed linen clean; the towels adequate; the shower provided hot water at a good pressure; and the tea/coffee making faciltiies sufficient.Sure it was not luxurious and may - if it was your own home- be in need of a fresh coat of paint etc perhaps a good cleaning to the carpets here and there. However, it is these restrictions or limits that make it a 3 star hotel at best.We did not eat in the hotel at all. Instead we had breakfast at either Mels diner or the 24 hr cafe on Van Ness and our evening meals elsewhere in the city.We had a few drinks at the bar where the prices were acceptable as was the service.However we enjoyed the surroundings and atmosphere of 'Tommy's Joynt' across the street better for a few drinks.The pool area during our stay was very quiet and on the one occasion we used the pool it ws heated and welcoming after a hard days sightseeing.A good feature of the hotel is its location. Whereas it may border areas to avoid around Ellis and Eddy streets if you stay to Geary Street and northwards it is fine. An easy walk to Union Square; or a direct bus line on Van Ness to the Wharf areas ; or a short stroll to the California line terminus; all made access and transport easy. All in all this hotel is okay as a base to stay and enjoy San Francisco. If the hotel is to play a big part in your stay then perhaps look elsewhere but if your hotel is merely a base to sleep/rest then it's location etc makes it worthy of consideration."
30,2026,"Jun 22 2009 	Scammed!!!!!!	First of all, I paid for a room with a &quot;poolside view&quot;, only to find out that the view I had was a view of the pavilion, next to the pool. The pool was actually a wading pool, not a lap pool, and the view I actually had was a view of the rusty metal pavilion roof...no pool in sight. Secondly, when I came back to the room after a long day off meetings, looking forward to a long shower, I discovered that they had not only NOT replenished my towels, but left no coffee replacements for the next morning. When I compained of the aforementioned items, i was met with a surly attitude from the front desk, not to mention that they overcharged me by $90 upon checkout. Oh yeah...AND the elevator was broken, so I got to enjoy the service elevator for 2 days....all in all... a disaster!!!!!!!"
31,2026,"Jun 20 2009 	Okay!!	The hotel room was clean - very basic. Nice big pool but was to cold to swim when we were there. It is about 6-7 blocks to Union square and there really is no nice restaurants around the area to eat, so for us the location wasn't great at all."
32,2026,"Jun 20 2009 	No!	We stayed here in years past and it was all right, but it has gone down hill. The elevators are all iffy; we got stuck in one. On upon arriving on our floor, it smelled like wet dirty diapers. There were pieces of paper along the hallway and dirty glasses which we thought would be cleaned up once the maids were gone; wrong, all was still littered the same way the next morning. Looked like the carpets needed cleaning. On entering our room, it was quite a tight space. The carpets were filthy, stains all over. The bedroom lights were not plugged in. We had to ask for towels, even though they knew there would be 3 of us. Speaking of which, they reminded me of gym towels in the 60s; thin and scratchy. One bed had long strands of hair in the sheets - hopefully, they were clean, but by then, I was too tired to ask for a change of rooms. The beds were like sleeping on a brick."
33,2026,"Jun 18 2009 	Beautiful Old Charming Hotel	Friendly, helpful staff. Charming, classic old hotel. Highly recommend a courtyard view room on an upper floor, especially the King Suites. Great discounts during the week (1/2 price?). Good value and good location."
34,2026,"Jun 10 2009 	Good/safe value for the money	We really liked this hotel. The staff was friendly, accommodating and very helpful. They auto-upgraded us to a premium room when we arrived for the same price. However, we grew up in the 60s without things like fans in the bathroom and surround-sound type showers. If you are looking for ultra-modern this is not the hotel for you. If you are looking for a good bargain, clean rooms, and a nice, safe place to stay, I highly recommend this hotel. Be aware, though, that you do pay for parking at this hotel. The parking prices are in line with public parking places. ($20 + tax a day) and are not included in the room price. But the garage is easy access, safe and you can park on the same floor as the lobby."
35,2026,"Jun 9 2009 	Good location but not nice inside.	Room is decent size but chair upholstry was very dirty. Inside coridors had trash near the ice machine. Lobby is very nice. The front desk needs to have a man that smiles and not snooty (like someone else commented here) . When I checked in, this man had a very snooty attitude while I did look around and several other female staff at the front desk did smile. So if you are checking in and you see this snooty looking guy, wait for a female staff - you will be glad you did!Get a inside room, they are quiter."
36,2026,"May 30 2009	Service was extremely sub par hotel dated	I had a room facing the street and it was so noisy! The room was extremely stuffy so we'd try to keep the window open during the day, but the noise from the street kept me up at night even with the window closed because it was single pane and cheap. Stay in a room facing the courtyard!The service was poor, especially in the restaurant. The breakfast crew was neglectful and rude, making it very clear that they didn't want to be there. The room was only a quarter full for breakfast and the hostess kept muttering about how busy they were and they didn't have any extra menu's.DO NOT eat at their restaurant. Our waitress was the worst I've ever had anywhere. She completely ignored her tables and spent most of her time hiding in the kitchen. Only eat outside the hotel...The beds were poorly made and didn't have real sheets on them, so as soon as you got in bed they would slide off.Also, the concierge gave us incorrect information that resulted in us going to an area after it had already closed down for the night. Really helpful."
37,2026,"May 29 2009 	room was spacious but very dirtyparking for guests very expensive..	hotel is old and so is everythink else in that hotel,which wouldn't be so badif it was clean....my room was spacious ,non smoking but yet there were cigarettes on the floor of my balcony,windows so dirty I didn't want to touch them,and don't even think of sitting down and having a cup of tea out there..small and old bathroom,plus they charge for parking like 23 $ a day ."
38,2026,"May 4 2009 	Lame hotel not at all what we expected.	I booked our room using the hotel's website for their &quot;Spring Fling&quot; promotion. I reserved a courtyard king and by the description on their page I was led to believe it was a room on the &quot;courtyard&quot; (imagine that!) right by the pool. The snotty man at the front desk briskly gave us our 8th floor room keys so we accepted somewhat confusedly. We hauled our stuff up to the room where, surprise surprise, neither key worked. Yay.So down we trot again with all of our belongings to the front desk to get new room keys. The clearly annoyed front desk clerk rushed around to get us a new room muttering something about a dead battery in the door lock and gave us a new room on the sixth floor. The room was clean but small. The armchair had a broken leg and fell over when I sat in it (how insulting!). The bathroom had a bonus hairdryer (interesting) but no conditioner. I called to request some from housekeeping and they sent up 3 more bottles of the shampoo/conditioner combo and some lotion. Was I supposed to mix them together?? The shampoo was more like hair gel and it took me like 2 1/2 bottles to get a lather going. Yuck!Later that night security got called on us for a noise complaint (whoops!) which I could understand, I don't really recall being that loud (teehee) but there were 3, count em, 3! big burly security guards staring me down when I opened the door. &quot;We know you're in there!&quot; they bellowed as I came to the door. Dickheads.All in all this place portrays itself as a classy establishment but it is anything but. The pool sucks and in the acres of concrete that surround it there is no hot tub.Lame, lame, lame."
39,2026,"Apr 27 2009	Nice Hotel	My family and I stayed at this hotel and they gave us a great room...very clean and very spacious. The front desk was very helpful and the location of the hotel is in a nice area with different restaurants around it.They also gave us free parking and $ 20 gas card as part of their promotion and that is a big help coz parking at SF is very expensive.Overall, we had a great stay and I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
40,2026,"Apr 27 2009 	Just an Average hotel but good value for San Fran	I got an amazing low price on this hotel with a package deal on travelocity.com. When compared with other hotels, it was significantly lower and was hard to pass up. Before I booked this hotel, I read all of the mixed reviews. So I was already pre-warned about what to expect and I was satisified. It's just an average dated hotel and is very simple. The carpet was in need of replacement and the bathroom needing some attention with caulking around the bathtub and bath vanity. The hotel location wasn't what I consider in a bad area at all. The air didn't work that well, but it wasn't a big deal since we just opened the sliding door to the balacony of the courtyard. Even with the door open, it was very quiet in the room. I've stayed at some upscale hotels in the past that were so noisy from trolley cars, buses, etc that I enjoyed how quiet the room was. A surprising feature was that the bathroom had bidet. The wireless internet didn't work that well in our room.The restaurants in the area (within 4 blocks) were really good and more where the locals eat. For the great value in how much the room cost, I would stay again. We were in SF for 3 nights. We were only in the room to sleep at night and nothing more. If you plan to be in your room all day, this may not be the hotel for you.Tip: Enterprise Rental car is on site. We found good rates on the web for that site to rent a car for the day to go out to wine country in Sonoma and Napa Valleys."
41,2026,"Apr 16 2009 	Not a bad stay	Overall, not a bad place to stay. It's a bit on the old side, so it may not be what some expect or desire. Our room was small. But hey, we're not hosting a party there. It's a place to relax after a day of being a tourist. Get a good night's sleep (it was quiet). Shower and hit it again the next day. We don't need much more than what was there. My wife is picky about hotels. She was OK with this one. That's a good stamp of approval. If you're looking for extravagance, then you have to pay for it. If you want an adequate &quot;base-camp&quot; with the basics that is convenient for sight-seeing (five stars for convenient), then this is your place. And a parking garage; that's a plus. Like a reviewer before me, I wasn't able to get ice. But it didn't ruin my stay there; just an inconvenience. I didn't get my gas card though. I forgot to ask about that. (&quot;Mel's Drive In&quot; across the street has good food.)"
42,2026,"Apr 11 2009 	good value but otherwise mediocre	If you arrive in SF by car and prefer a central location to staying in a motel on the periphery this may be a good choice. I had a so-so room with free parking for a little over 100 bucks. I also got a welcome package that consisted of a $20 gas card and some kind of cheapo hinky digital camera that didn't work.The staff are helpful and friendly and the location is very convenient to just about anything.Rooms are not much to brag about. Furnishings are quite basic. Electric outlets near the desk do not accommodate grounded plugs. Heat/AC controls are a mystery. Small bathroom had peeling wallpaper, shower curtain missing hooks, and no fart-fan. Out in the hall I tried the ice machine 3 different times and never got any ice (despite the fact that it was obviously running and using up a lot of power).They have wi-fi, but it's through ATT and costs 10 bucks a day. In this day and age, wifi should be free."
43,2026,"Apr 5 2009 	Sufficient	Reading the other reviews, i was quite surprised by some. My room was large, had clean linens, nice fluffy towels, clean bathroom, and was pretty quite. The pool was used by the guests, and seemed like a nice addition. I thought the room had a fan, which I didn't use, but it did have the option to open the window. This was nice to get some fresh air into the room. Yes, the staff wasn't kissing my behind, but that doesn't freak me out. They were polite, and that was sufficient. I felt safe as a single traveler. I stayed one night, had parking included, plus a $20 gas card and cute little digital camera included for 109.00 +tax. For the price and the fact that many places charge you $35+ for parking, this was a good deal. Yes, it's run down, but having stayed in other hotels for not that much less that would be considered stay at your own risk types, I'd return here without hesitation."
44,2026,"Apr 3 2009 	Well we liked it......	Okay, so the interior decor is looking tired, but the place is being pulled down next year so the owners are not going to spend money on redecorating it are they- would you????? Anyway, how much time are you planning to spend in the hotel as a tourist? If it's 5 star luxury you want then pay the money and stay in a 5 star hotel!The place is clean, including the rooms. The beds were comfortable, we got running hot and cold water and everything worked. It's also in a good location for Union Square and Downtown. All the staff were friendly and helpful from the front desk staff to the barmen to the restaurant staff to the maids.We only ate breakfast at the hotel-we went for the full buffet each morning which was not extensive but even a fussy eater like me could find enough to eat. My only gripe-the buffet breakfast is overpriced for what it is (we only got charged 2 dollars more per person in Las Vegas for a far more extensive buffet).Overall though, a good experience and I would recommend others to stay here."
45,2026,Mar 30 2009 	Check the bathroom	There were dead insects in the bathroom on and next to the tray with the cups. I notified the front desk staff who was not concerned and asked if I wanted someone to clean the bathroom. She had a lot of attitude and was not too concerned about the insects. We finally got moved to another room which had a dirty towel in the bathrooom. A hotel that does not care about cleanliness is not a hotel you should stay at.
46,2026,Mar 30 2009 	Our last stay at this hotel	The rooms used to be good. We have stayed here about once a year for the last seven years but this will be our last. The towels had holes. The toilet sounded like it was going to fall through the floor when I sat on it. A lot of light bulbs throughout the hotel were burnt out. The elevators jerked violently when they came to a stop. Internet access was not free even on the hotel supplied computers in the lobby. We will never stay there again even though we love the location.
47,2026,"Mar 17 2009 	It was okay.......for this old hotel.	I stayed here for three nights. Staffs was really nice and helpful.However, hotel is just old and need some major renovations.No air condition, no breakfast, small room, old bathroom.For about the same price I would go with Holiday Inn which is a coulple blocks away.Location is okay....easy acess to Union square or even Gloden Gate B with public transportation. Just many homeless guys on the street."
48,2026,"Mar 16 2009 	Be careful...	I have stayed at this particular hotel for 12 years now. But this trip was terrible. Our room rate was mis-quoted and it took thirty minutes to rectify that issue. Then we realized we weren't getting complimentary parking and was forced to pay 20.00 a night. If the hotel refuses to comp. the parking rates, stay at a neighboring hotel (Holiday Inn, Hilton, Best Western) that does.About midnight, someone was trying to enter our room. We learned that the front desk gave another guest the same room. We called the front desk and they acted like we were in the wrong. They asked who I was and how I got the room??The noise level was excessive as we were next to a room that was partying all night long. The complaints to the front desk did not reslove the issue. As a result, we didn't fall asleep until 4:00am.Again, I have stayed at this particular hotel for 12 years and will never return after this terrible ordeal. The hotel is under new management and it shows. My suggestion is to stay somewhere else at a neighboring hotel that offers parking and soundproof walls.The hotel does not offer free wi-fi. You must pay for it. It doesn't offer office services either. You must pay extra for that too."
49,2026,"Feb 24 2009 	Best described as	Only stayed here because I was attending a conference at the hotel. The entire place could use a serious face-lift. The room was nothing spectacular and at $120/night I don't think I was getting my money's worth. I'm 5'8 and the shower head only reached up to my neck. The breakfast buffet was overpriced and greasy. The location is ok, but I was told not to venture south as the hotel is on the edge of the sketchy Tenderloin area. Overall I would not recommend it to friends."
50,2026,"Feb 23 2009 	Good value for the money (at $69/night on weekend)	Cathedral Hill's key advantage is that it is decent value for the money (paid $69/night on Saturday). However, you get what you pay for. It is by no means a luxury hotel, in fact the room is pretty old and outdated, mattress not the most comfortable, blankets are thin and old. The heating/air system is ancient, it doesn't work that great and is somewhat loud. Its the type of a hotel you'd stay at if you plan to be out and about all day and just need a place to sleep. There's coffee maker in room, toiletries are very limited (I think it was just shampoo, soap and lotion).Rooms are good size for San Francisco, compare to other hotels but I would not say its large. The hotel is in a safe and convenient neighborhood. It has covered, gated parking ($20 extra). There's a decent restaurant and bar downstairs. There are a lot of other dining choices in walking distance from hotel. Friendly front desk staff. Maintenance called back right away after I inquired about the heater. All in all, if you need a place to sleep for a few nights, its a good choice. But if you plan to spend a lot of time in the room for an extended stay, it would probably be pretty miserable."
51,2026,Feb 23 2009 	Dirty rooms and not friendly staff at the registration desk.	Very dirty rooms (plenty of cigarette butts on the balcony) and not friendly staff at the registration desk (at least one person who didn't want to make any effort to understand foreigners). I will not recommand this hotel to friends.
52,2026,"Feb 23 2009 	Good Location but not ggod rooms...	We stayed in this hotel in Feb 21, I liked the location, the price was OK, but the hotel in general looks old, the paper in the wall are peeling off, the heat/cool system is old, the windows are single panel that you hear all from the street, the furniture need to updated, the TV is so old that some channels were dificult to see( very dark), at least in my room (761)It's clean but old. If you are comming with family I wouldn't recoment this hotel."
53,2026,"Feb 20 2009 	Watch out for bedbugs	I stayed at this hotel in Dec 2008, and had bedbugs in my room. Staff were great, immediately moved me to another room in another section. But be sure to check the mattress if staying here...Otherwise hotel was fine, but a bit threadbare."
54,2026,"Feb 15 2009 	Thin walls 	In desperate need of an update and sound proofing. Room was small and had only the bare essentials. It is only a slight step up from a motel 6, just barely. The tv was crappy and old, where's the LCD TV?? They cost only a little bit more than that tiny TV in the room and you don't need the huge mammoth TV case dominating the room. The street noise was absolutely horrible, the windows don't seal so there was noise leakage into the room, felt like we were basically on the street. Where's the double paned windows? Fire Alarm went off in the building at 7:30 AM Sunday morning! It ended being a false alarm. Rather annoying since the message said to evacuate the building while the fire alarm was going off."
55,2026,"Jan 28 2009 	Time to tear it down	$115.00 at the Cathedral Hill Hotel gets you a rude male desk clerk, who claims that a government employee discount will cost you 50 dollars more than the regular rate, and gives you a patio level room despite requests for a room with a balcony. In that room you may be treated to a huge mosquito eater smashed into the wall above the television, and a broken room heater like we were. No heat wouldn't have been a big problem except it was winter during a major cold snap. We moved to another room where the heater worked a little bit but only after being made to wait for maintenance to come pull the unit apart to see if he could fix it first. This was at 10p.m. mind you and I was bundled up in a cashmere trench, sweatjacket, and a wool beanie trying to get warm. Most hotels would have just switched us immediately considering the late hour but not Cathedral Hill.  When the maintenance man pulled the filter off the ancient unit it was so encrusted with filth I wouldn't have known what it was if he hadn't told me. He was nice enough to go check another room to see if the heater worked. Then he called the front desk, told them to move us, and left the new rooms heater on so it would be ready for us. It's pretty sad that the maintenance man has to call and bully the front desk into moving us like they should have done in the first place but I'm grateful for his assistance. The room wasn't fantastic but at least there were no visible dead things and there was some heat.The strange thing is, my husband and I stayed at this hotel a few months prior and were given a nicer room for less money. We liked it enough to choose it again for this latest trip. We wont make that mistake again. A man in the elevator the next morning told us the Hotel is scheduled to be torn down in a couple of years to make way for a new hospital. That can't happen soon enough if you ask me."
56,2026,Jan 19 2009 	Great Location	The hotel is situated on Van Ness Blvd and is in the center of just about all things you'd want to do while in SF. Walking distance to most amenities. The only downside was the age o the hotel. It could use some updating.
57,2026,"Jan 18 2009	Noisy	Room was very large and clean. Parking is $20 a day for guests in garage under hotel, get it included in your package. Mattress was too hard and pillows were flat. Our real issue was noise on our floor. After a 10:30 PM visit by hotel staff to the room next to us because of noise and smoking, party moved to the pool area or somwhere outside and continued for another hour or so. Noise started back up aroud 3:30 AM worse than before. Finally left at 4:30 AM, no staff at front desk for checkout. Janitor had to call her on his radio. Probably not the rule there, but I need more than 4 hours sleep a night. Place was loaded with staff early in the evening, they should of followed up with a known issue."
58,2026,"Jan 13 2009 	Needs a renovation but the service was great	Stayed at this property for a meeting that was held on-site. The staff greeted me courteously, and they seemed very knowledgeable of the area, which is very close to Union Square. I'm sure the Cathedral Hill was very nice at one time, but it is sadly in need of renovations, especially in the guest rooms. I took the advice of some other reviewers and booked a courtyard room, so traffic noise wouldn't be an issue. The room was huge, mainly because all of the furniture was arranged by the window. It was clean, but clearly showed signs of wear. There were few light fixtures or lamps, and some of them were very dim. However, the breakfast in the restaurant downstairs was plentiful and rather inexpensive. Another bonus was the parking garage immediately under the property and accessible by the main bank of elevators. Please note that guests arriving late at night or in the wee hours of the morning cannot access the elevators from the garage. The door to them is locked and guests must exit the garage street level and walk around to the front entrance of the hotel."
59,2026,"Jan 5 2009 	Great Value No Frills	The hotel was offering a really nice package for two nights where they paid for your parking and give you a $20 gas card and free disposable camera. The hotel was too far to walk to the tourist locations but was along a bus route that would take you there. The lighting in the room was not so great and when I got in their was a cigarette butt left on the floor. All in all, the hotel was good. The people who work there are nice and knowledgable."
60,2026,"Jan 4 2009 	This was the ""Jack Tarr Hotel"" in Coppola's movie ""The Conversation.""	No one seems to remember this detail, but if you're a movie buff, I urge you to see this film before coming to SF. Your stay at the Jack Tarr hotel will be much more meaningful, and its dated quality will wind up having a retro appeal. Agreed that the Wharf hotels may offer better value, but you are not as centrally located down there. This location has scads of express buses going in every direction and is almost at the City's geographic center. If you're looking for quintessential SF with high Victorian architecture in a charming neighborhood lined with painted ladies, this is not your place-- but then those wharf hotels aren't, either. . ."
61,2026,"Jan 2 2009 	New Years Eve Stay	A couple of friends and I stayed here for New Years Eve 2008. We went to go see Phil Lesh &amp; Bob Weir play at the Bill Graham Civic Center. Cathedral Hill is walking distance from the venue.Our hotel room was really spacious and we had a great view of Van Ness Ave and the city. The staff at the front desk &amp; bell boys were helpful and really nice. I would stay here again, for sure! My only complaints were that it took the service desk two phone calls to bring us up some extra towels, but I think they were all really busy on New Years. They also made me sign this &quot;No Party&quot; policy form and then checked our room keys on New Years night. I thought that was kind of lame. I understand they don't want randoms and bums coming to hang out, but come on, it's New Years Eve... who isn't going to party? We partied and didn't have any problems. Also- I don't like how early their pool closes down, but the patio area surrounding it is really nice. I dig the Japanese landscaping."
62,2026,"Dec 31 2008 	Read the aid carefully	I will make the story short:Additional cost:$22 dollars per day, per car parking cost. $9.95 per day wireless Internet, use your own laptop.$5 per 20 minutes if use hotel computer for your internet.Internet Available not Free!Free coffee and coffee maker at your room.Soaps, ion, cups, hair dryer, and towels thats all you got.I was there for 2 days, room was ok, not too clean, I later on moved East 40 minutes away from Golden Gate Bridge and checked in at Day Inn Motel, I got better price, same room with Microwave, Soaps, ion, cups, hair dryer, towels, Free Internet, Free Parking, and a small refrigerate. Happy camper!"
63,2026,Dec 30 2008 	Great Experiance!!	From The Time We Checked in Until The Time We Checked Out It Was A Great Experience.From The Dinner To the After Dinner Drinks Everything Went Very Smooth.We Will Be Back On Our Next Trip To San Francisco. Thank You!!!
64,2026,"Dec 27 2008 	Mediocre at best	Stayed here for 5 nights with my husband in December 2008. It's clean, no frills, and comfortable, yet pretty close to being run down and outdated (looks like it was built in the 60s or early 70s and was was remodeled in the early 90s). Pros: central location, affordable (we booked a package on Travelocity and the hotel was essentially free, but I wouldn't pay more than $50 a night) quiet, and staff was friendly and helpful. We asked the front desk if they could store our laptops for the day while we went sight-seeing (no safe in the room) which they did and were very accommodating. At the same time, the decor and fixtures are pretty dated and, as others have said, no frills. There is also a charge for internet and parking. (A parking fee I can understand--it's San Francisco, but not offering free internet is usually a deal-breaker for me). All in all I don't feel ripped off but I wouldn't stay here again. I am honestly really surprised by previous reviews that described it as nice. &quot;Okay&quot; is pretty dead on. Not bad, but nothing special. If you're just looking for an expensive place to crash, you probably won't be disappointed but expect nothing more."
65,2026,"Dec 26 2008 	good location okay hotel	The location of this hotel is very convenient, easy to get to Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. Other than housekeeping, we found the staff to be a bit aloof and not overly willing to ensure we had a pleasant stay. Beware of the Breakfast buffet downstairs where the food is mediocre at best, nothing special. Cost is $15 plus the hostess adds in an automatic 15% tip on the bill (we had a party of 4, not a large group). We didn't realize this as we didn't get the bill until we went up to the front to pay, and already had left her a tip at the table. There's a 24 hr sandwich/donut shop across the street with good coffee. No fridge in the rooms, older t.v. and beddings. The price was good and the room served its purpose for us. A good no frills hotel with a touch of arrogance."
66,2026,"Dec 17 2008 	A Wonderful Experience	My son was married in the church on Franklin Street behind this hotel so this was a perfect location for our out-of-town family and friends. I was worried as, having scouted the place beforehand, it is true that the rooms are tattered and in serious need of updating. That is the ONLY negative thing I can say about this hotel though and I would give it an &quot;excellent&quot; rating save for this one matter.  All the staff we had contact with was FABULOUS....even the housekeeping lady was a sweetheart and went out of her way to find out what little &quot;extras&quot; we would like. We have never before left a tip for the housekeeping staff but we did do this here. All of our guests who ate at Jack Tar Bar and Grill raved about the food (me too!) and the staff there was very friendly and fun and helpful. Some days they were a bit slow getting the food out but we were there to have quality time with out -of- town family and friends so we were in no hurry.  And ladies...Jodi in Art's Hair Salon is a jewel! As Mother of the Groom, she had me come in for a consultation two days before the wedding and when our friends and relatives saw what she had done with my hair on Saturday morning she suddenly had bunches of unanticipated bookings! She did my daughter's hair for free and GAVE me one of the sterling silver and garnet rings she designed that I had admired. Needless to say, I paid her quite a great deal more than she asked for to do my hair.  Tommy's Joynt across the street was a great evening gathering spot for all of us ...good food there too! An excellent Peruvian/Mexican restaurant is also right across the street. Our relatives and friends hopped on the bus in front of the hotel and were at the Wharf in 10 minutes.  I cannot say enough good things about our five days in this hotel so if you don't mind rooms that are not &quot;tops&quot; I highly recommend the place. It will soon be converted to a hospital so...of course they are not going to put any money into updating anything."
67,2026,"Dec 3 2008 	Okay but there is better	Hotel was ok. Looking a little dated now. Room was ok. Pool looked pretty good but not ideal weather for going swimming. Staff were not the friendliest, apart from one of the barmen in the restaurant. Location was ok, although not brilliant. San Francisco is small enough that if you dont mind walking, you can get almost everywhere in time. The hotel is a short walk to everywhere though. OK if you want a slightly cheaper hotel, but there are better alternatives closer to Union Square and Fishermans Wharf."
68,2026,Nov 27 2008 	Great Location	Great location!! We were able to walk to most places in the city. Not fancy but very comfortable. Very accessible parking if you have a car.
69,2026,"Nov 22 2008 	wonderful surprise	Originally booked 2 nights off reviews from Internet. Wasn't sure what to expect or what the area would be like. What a great surprise when we pulled up and saw the front lobby with concierge and stores!! Parking was included in our price, which was a great selling point. The rooms were a little older, but clean, smoke free and good size. A little noisy on the street side at night. The location was awesome!!! Close to trolley and an easy walk to many areas!!.. Felt very safe walking the streets at night.We enjoyed our stay so much that we rebooked for two more nights during the week. This time had an inside room and a great view of the pool and courtyard area!! All the employees were very helpful, and we got some great suggestions from the concierge. I would stay here with my family/children no problem. Great deal for the price!!!!!"
70,2026,"Nov 19 2008 	Tired and tattered but cheap	The old Jack Tar Hotel (now the Cathedral Hill Hotel) is a leftover from the 60's. My dad used to go there for conferences and it was then a upscale place. The lobby is nice, but our room was tired and tattered and looked as if it hadn't had any upgrading or maintenance since my dad last stayed in it. It still has two-pronged electrical outlets by the sink, with an adaptor in between the outlet and the hairdryer.Despite being old, and not particularly loved by its ownership, it was clean and served the purpose that we were looking for--a clean bed at a cheap price in the City."
71,2026,"Nov 13 2008 	Excellent Location 	This Hotel is EXCELLENT. They have a good location to just about everything you would want to see. Very personable staff, and clean comfortable rooms. We stayed for medical visits at Calif. Pacific Medical Center, for Transplant Surgery. This hotel has a complimentary stops for shuttle service back and forth from the hospital. They strive to make your visit as stress free as possible. Kudos to them. You won't be dissapointed."
72,2026,"Nov 11 2008	Very Nice Experiance	I recently stayed at this hotel for my 24th birthday. I was skeptical about it because of the reviews on here but to my surprise I found most of them to be wrong. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS HOTEL. We stayed in one of the one bedroom suites, which had an amazing view and tons of room. The carpet looked like it was new and the room was really clean. The suite had two bathrooms in it which was a nice surprise and they looked like they had been remodeled recently. The seating area had a pull out double bed, which was really comfortable for my guests. The room had a very elegant feel to it, with wrap around windows to create an amazing view of the city. The hotel staff was very accommodating. I went down and asked for two more blankets and they brought them back up to the room for me. In the morning I asked if we could have a later check out and they gave us two more hours, without chargeThe lobby of the hotel was really nice and check in and out was a breeze. Parking is extra but only $20 which is amazing for this city. The location of the hotel is really nice also. It is walking distance to Union Square, a $7 cab ride to the Marina. My only complaint is that the walls are thin and you can hear people in other rooms but that is typical of a lot of hotels and something that you just deal with when staying in a hotel. All in all I really enjoy this hotel and it is a steal of a deal when you look at the prices of other hotels around the area. I will without a doubt be staying at this hotel again"
73,2026,"Nov 8 2008 	Overall State of Disrepair	I stayed 3 nights here at the Cathedral Hill Hotel as part of a conference package as the conference I attended was held there. The night hotel staff was personable and friendly, even when I had to come back to the check in desk, as my electronic room key did not work (quite a trek hauling luggage and waiting for the elevator to come up to the eighth floor). The elevators were extremely slow and out of the three, I only saw two that were actually running the time that I was there. The room was very, very small (two doubles), and in a state of disrepairpeeling and scared wallpaper, peeling paint and mildew on the bathroom ceiling and poor lighting period (bath &amp; room). Lots of noise from the hallway and street, even on the eighth floor. The beds were hard and the pillows were hard and flat; I did not sleep well at all. The conference rooms were also in disrepair, but the catered food was good. For the price that I paid ($129.00/night) plus parking, I do not feel that our large conference group got our moneys worth. I will not be staying at the Cathedral Hill Hotel again unless it is after a major and complete renovation of all of the roomsit was a huge disappointment to say the least."
74,2026,"Nov 4 2008 	Overall Nice Hotel	We needed a room at the last minute, I booked the room, then read the reviews, I was a bit worried, but pleasantly surprised upon arrival. For the price of the room, free parking and a free buffet breakfast for everyone, not just a continental breakfast, a nice bacon, eggs, sausage, potatoes, french toast, danish, cereal, juices, fresh fruit, oatmeal, and more, it ended up being an extremely reasonable rate. The room was not beautifully decorated or freshly painted, but it was clean, big, and had computer access, showtime and a very clean bathroom. We needed help with the heater, a maintenance person was there within minutes to help. Service was excellent and staff was friendly. Basically if you are looking for a nice place to stay for a reasonable rate, this is a nice and clean place stay. The room smelled a little of smoke, but they have asked that no one smoke in the rooms, either they are still trying to get the smell out from past smoking rooms or people smoke in the room anyway. I dont think they want to decorate, paint and put a lot of money into it if they are just going to replace it with a hospital someday, that is what we were told is going to happen."
75,2026,"Oct 31 2008 	Very good stay experience	I had nothing but the best of experiences. From check in to housekeeping to gift shop, etc., all employees were courteous, friendly, and helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. Hotel security paid close attention to the safety of its guests, and the help desk quickly and accurately mapped out routes to places I wanted to go.This was my second visit to the hotel. The only down side to my visit was learning Cathedral Hill was going to be replaced by a medical facility sometime next year.While the hotel is my first choice of a place to stay in San Francisco and the people there are nice, not everyone outside it is like that. Just be street smart and you should be fine."
76,2026,"Oct 27 2008 	Website is deceiving!!!	On the website this hotel looked Great. The Lobby looks good with a nice restaurant, salon, gift shop &amp; more &amp; the employees were nice. When you actually enter your room it looks like a damaged dirty motel room that should be located off in the middle of nowhere. The bathroom toilet is the same as a park toilet. The wallpaper was peeling, The room was dirty &amp; even had bug issues. The parking garage had a sewage leak from the hotel &amp; smelled horrible! Do not let the website fool you. Do not stay at this Hotel!"
77,2026,"Oct 26 2008 	Not a bad value hotel	Arrived in SF and upon arrival requested a room with a higher floor, so we get into the room, there is new carpet, clean...nice view looking out towards Van ness ave, Tommys Joynt restaurant.What is cannot understand is why there is a phone in the bathroom, also the bathroom came without a fan, and was kinda dark while showeringLIKED Internet in the hotel rooms ( had to ask front desk for Wire )location is great to explore SF by foot....staff was courteous and attentive but sometimes they seem disinterested....very good location to walk to Union Square and California cable car line, walk to Chinatown is very close too..room was clean, comfortable, bright and kept well.DISLIKED....pool and lobby photos on the website look much better but need some polish....there are some 'funny' neighbours towards the south/southeast of hotel....did not give any money to panhandlers which i usually do ( felt safe just to walk straight past ) I would recommend this hotel to larger groups of people or if your like to walk alot to see SF"
78,2026,"Oct 26 2008 	Good Value at Cathedral Hill Hotel	This is part of their half-off fall special, so week night rates were $99 and weekends were $142. The hotel is good value for the money, but it is an older hotel that probably needs a renovation. The walls are a bit thing, the furniture, beds, and linens are clean but again a little outdated. There was no free internet and I had to spend $5 for 20 minutes of internet use.The location is good and you are not too far from where you would want to go in SF. There are also many reasonably priced restaurants near-by. Overall, I saved money on an above average hotel stay (7 out of 10)."
79,2026,"Oct 25 2008 	Fred Flintstone has a softer bed	Very disappointed with the room. First thing I noticed were the three huge stains on the carpet, next wal paper peeling from walls, then torn curtin in the room, and finally the mildew around windows in restaurant (great if you are trying to diet, guaranteed to curb your appetite), The elevator seemed to have a problem stopping on the 3rd floor. Had to wait over 5 minutes for one of the three elevators to stop on the third floor so I could board. I could see it going past the floor without stopping. Was beginning to wonder if I would ever be able to get on the elevator. Not good for disabled people who can't use stairs as a backujp.I have never slept on a bed so hard, my coworker described the bed as &quot;a Fred Flintstone bed, only Fred's bed is probably softer.&quot; Unfortunately I was there for a day business trip and spent non work related hours in the room. The room lacked adequate furnishings. The only chair in the room was an office chair, not very comfortable for watching the tiny television. Only good thing about the chair is that it could easily be moved close to the small television to see it better. Lack of an adequate chair to relax in forced me to spend 12 to 14 hours on the rock hard bed. The room was stuffy, it had an air conditioning unit, but even with my hand over the vent I could barely feel the air movement. Did not feel safe leaving the window open while I slept as it would have been too easy for anyone to walk along the roof and enter the room through the open window.Even though I was willing to pay for Internet access, the wireless access was not configured as a router, so I was unable to obtain an IP address to get onto the Internet. Hotel staff were unable to help with the situation. This was a critical feature for me as I needed to stay in contact with students enrolled in my online classes. The room service was quick and friendly and the food was good. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was good and reasonably priced, although plan to spend $4.50 for a class of orange juice, service was prompt and friendly."
80,2026,"Oct 14 2008 	not from the tenderloins	We had a unique situation in that someone took money out of account without authorization and at our arrival is when we found out about it because our card was declinded. At that time we were treated very nice and was very understanding. The person at the desk asked that we stay at Cathedral Hill the next time. And because we were treated so kindly and with understanding we were. We arrived at a family member's house and told them what happened. They loaned us the money until we could work things out. Immediately I called Cathedral Hill back. They kindly rebooked the room and stated we could pay cash. On our arrival the next day, we were treated like some one from the tenderloins and asked to stand aside while they help other customers. After we paid cash we were given a room with the wallpaer peeling off, kept awake by our toilets as well as the neighbor's because they sounded like torpeedoes being deployed and there was mold in the shower as well as all over the curtain. We shall never go back and will pay the extra to stay at The Opal as we previously did."
81,2026,"Oct 7 2008 	Room for improvement	We arrived here after spending the previous night at the marvelous Bay Landing Hotel close to the airport and soon realised that we were not going to have it so good in SF central!We had sat nav so not too many problems finding the hotel, it's always tricky when you're in a new city but it stands out on a major road and is a big hotel.Once inside we checked in without too many issues. The place is a little dated and appeared to be undergoing a bit of a makeover. No free parking in the large underground car park but it was something like $12 a day which is not that bad in SF and when there is a group of people chipping in.The hotel room was fairly dull and had a bit of a strange smell, sorely in need of decoration and new carpets etc but not dirty. The bathroom was also very dated but bearable. Sliding doors didn't seem to lock properly either. I think some rooms had been refurbed, maybe if you complain they'll upgrade you but we are all fairly laid back and were eager to see the city rather than argue with hotel staff.The pool looked OK but the sun didn't seem to shine out there too often so we didn't bother. Cathedral Hill is a big hotel but only has a small bar/restaurant in the lobby and a small shop and coffee shop.Right across the street is 'Tommys Joynt' which is a good bar/carvery/diner. Open til very late, friendly staff and good value food if you don't want to search for a restaurant plus loads of beers. Opposite is a 50's style diner. Much nicer than IHOP. Hotel is probably about 3 miles from the Fisherman's Wharf area and 15min walk from city centre shopping etc, you can walk (long) or use public transport if not driving.We often walked through the area late at night and although there are some shady characters in the area they gave us no problems at all. I felt safer here than walking past drunk chavs in UK town centres but still, be alert and don't go down any dark alleys...I think Cathedral Hill is a little pricey and you should shop around before staying here. Staff on the whole were ok, not the happiest I've met but they weren't miserable either.If you're not too fussy and not a clean freak you'll probably be ok here, otherwise dig deeper and pay for something better."
82,2026,"Sep 30 2008 	Great service Fair price Tired rooms.	The Cathedral Hill Hotel was significantly less expensive than other hotels in the same area. The service was outstanding, with friendly, efficient staff and a reminder email when our reservation date was near. Online booking was easy and there were no problems with the reservation.We ended up staying in two different rooms because of a very loud pool party that was going on directly below the first room we were given. Management was extremely accommodating about changing our room and even let us check out the new room to be sure it was quiet. The lobby and restaurant areas are very nice, but the rest of the hotel is showing its age, though everything was clean. The floor indicator lights in the elevators didn't work. The first room we were given was in desparate need of at least a new coat of paint to cover all of the scuff marks. The second room looked as though it had been painted more recently, but both rooms had stained carpet, old-looking electrical outlets, and outdated tile and fixtures. The rooms also do not come standard with refrigerators. Rooms with refrigerators are available at an extra charge.While priced about $100 less than the Holiday Inn down the street, the Cathedral Hill was still below expectations for its $124 per night price tag. With some rennovation, it would be a great value. Of course, then they would probably have to charge more, so it may be this is what a reasonably priced motel in downtown San Francisco looks like."
83,2026,"Sep 24 2008	Not recommended	Stayed at the Cathedral Hill on business. Good price but you get what you pay for. Convenient location but sketchy neighborhood, would not walk around after dark alone. Bathrooms pretty awful, in dire need of upgrading. Couple in the next room was screaming profanities at each other at 8 am. Wondered why they had the huge security guards after dark until scary-looking guy standing next to us at the elevator dropped a little baggie of white powder on the floor, snatched it up quickly and then sped off up the stairs. Don't stay here..."
84,2026,"Sep 23 2008	Good for the price but sketchy neighborhood	The Cathedral Hill Hotel in San Francisco was a decent hotel for the price we paid. The hotel itself is just an average hotel. No frills or anything. But it was pretty clean which is really the only thing I cared about. Very basic room.Some nice things about this hotel:There is a restaurant, a little shop where you can get basic toiletries and stuff, and a little coffee shop with good coffee and baked goods right inside the hotel, which was very convenient. The staff was helpful and polite.Some not so nice things about this hotel:While it's situated just a short cab ride/bus ride away (or about a 30 min to 1 hour walk) to most of the attractions, the hotel is not in a great neighborhood. There are a ton a homeless people, drug dealers/users in the area. While this didn't really bother me during the day, I didn't feel very safe at night.All in all, pretty good hotel."
85,2026,"Sep 21 2008 	Not a bad place to stay	Date: September, 2008Reviewer: Vicki and Tony, Sydney Australia We have just returned from 3 weeks in the United States. We started our holiday in San Francisco and stayed at the Cathedral Hotel located on Van Ness Ave. We found the best deal for San Francisco hotels on LastMinute.com.au. The hotel was clean and comfortable, the staff courteous and friendly. The noise however from busy Van Ness Ave was incessant and intrusive, so if you need something a little more quieter, then you should consider somewhere else or a room towards the back of the property. We were offered such a room on checkin for an extra US$50 a night, which we declined.The Cathedral Hotel is reasonably located, especially if you want to be near Union Square. It was an easy bus ride (or cable car if you wish to walk the 6-7 blocks) down to the Pier 39 and Fishermans wharf area.The hotel has a pool and a fitness area, but there is so much to do and see in San Francisco that we didnt have time to make use of these facilities and we got plenty of exercise walking around. One lesson that we learnt booking our accommodation on the internet and not knowing our way around American airports, is to enquire about shuttle services from the airport to the hotel, before you travel. We made this mistake and consequently spent a lot on taxis, on arriving at each destination. Once at the hotel we were able to organise a shuttle back, a much cheaper option."
86,2026,"Sep 17 2008 	Unexpected jewell in downtown San Francisco	Spent 4 nites with son and daughter-in-law in 2 rooms. We were almost midnight arriving but still got adjoining rooms at less than 1/2 price of other downtown hotels. Pay parking but unlimited, easy, in-&amp;-outs. Every employee we came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Had some concerns about neighborhood from previous customer reviews, but we were out on street as late as 2AM and plenty of people, well lit and eateries available. Mel's diner and bakery (24/7) were great on opposite corner of street. Major bus line on Van Ness (in front of hotel) and Polk St (1 block down). Buses run every 10-12 minutes. Got to Wharf and Pier 39 in 17 minutes. California Streeet Cable car in 2 minutes (12 minutes on foot) which intersects with cars going to wharf. Can't say enough good about this place and plan to stay there on next trip."
87,2026,"Sep 15 2008 	This place Sucked.	This place Sucked. The room was much much smaller then the internet led us to believe. They NEVER told us ahead of time that there was a daily fee for parking. Only until the second day did I realize it because not being from a huge city I had no idea they charged 20$ per day for my car including the last day we were there and we checked out at 10am. I mean the parking is in the hotel garage. In the Morning the maids were so loud I was absolutely shocked. The 7th floor ice machine never worked and we had to go to the 6th floor to get ice, The elevator was scary and closed on my fingers at one point and it took so long I mean so long to go up or down. And sometimes it would stop on a random floor and open and then sit there no matter what button you pushed. The pool was FILTHY. And I met 4 different people that had snuck in to use it cause it was a well knownplace to sneak in and swim. I cancelled a movie and was still charged. At one point I called the front and the phone rang and rang and rang. I called back and finally someone answered and she offered NO apology for how long it took. I am so dissapointed. I will never stay there again and neither should you. I say this because months prior we stayed at a dive and I mean dive in the Tenderloin Dist. and it was about the same service and 50$ per night and they did not charge a parking fee for parking in the garage."
88,2026,"Sep 11 2008 	I'm sure it was a very nice hotel.................30 years ago!!	The hotel is very old. I'm sure it was great place back in the day. The room was run down, not very clean. The carpets were stained and the beds felt like you were sleeping on plywood. We needed a roll away cot for our daughter and some of the springs were starting to stick through. The beds have those old fashioned bedspreads, the ones that NEVER get washed. Overall not a great choice. I'll stick to Holiday Inn."
89,2026,"Sep 10 2008 	Average	Average hotel stay, room was clean although the decor is a bit tired. Three night stay and the rate was fairly reasonable compared to other SF hotels. Depends on what you are looking for in a hotel, it's okay if you're just using it as a base but we would probably stay somewhere else if we ever went back to SF. Worst points are the lifts (elevators) - rubbish and really slow and wi-fi is not included in rate.The location was ok, we didn't mind walking but there are plenty taxis sitting outside of the hotel.The concierge service was helpful for booking tours.One tip if you do use this hotel: the shuttle service to the airport was really good, the concierge service organised it for us $26 dollars for two which was reasonable and quick,"
90,2026,"Sep 6 2008 	It was good but I probably wouldn't stay here again	This hotel had both pros and cons. There were 2 of us in a room for a 5 night stay.The PROS: The restaurant staff was incredibly friendly and the food was good. Happy hour specials were good. There are a few bus stops within a few blocks and the trolley was about 5 blocks down. ( I guess those could be cons for someone that doesn't want to walk though)CONS: The beds were super firm (we stayed on the 5th floor). The traffic noise reached the room (our room faced Van Ness). It sounded like the windows were open all the time. The air conditioning did not work very well. The hot water did not work properly. Sometimes it was okay, other showers hot water would burst out and nearly burn, one night we had no hot water at all.All in all I felt like the rooms were a little over priced for what you got. We relied totally on public transportation during on trip, I would not recommend this hotel to someone wanting to ride the bus and trolley for their entire trip. The walk to the stops is a bit long."
91,2026,"Sep 4 2008 	Clean and serviceable hotel	Nice stay in a clean hotel, conveniently located for daily activities. Close to most usual attractions (walking distance) with good parking availability. We took the parking included rate (120 $/night) with multiple ins and outs. The only annoynace was that the garage closes hotel's internal access (to elevators) at 11 p.m. so you've to exit and walk 50 yards through the street.We had no difficulties but if you plan to stay out late, avoid walking around because suspicious faces show around.This hotel is a good value option if you plan to enjoy the city during the day.Be aware that there are a lot of notices about asbestos used as construction materials in the property.Another pitiful detail: the TV set works well but the channel availability is very poor. A lot of marketing channels but, for example, Weather Channel is blocked all day."
92,2026,"Sep 2 2008 	Decent Affordable Hotel	Hotel was decent and very affordable. Ours was relatively clean (except our balcony, which could have been cleaner). Nothing fancy, but then, we weren't in SF for the hotel. Get a room that faces the pool. Very sunny and nice balcony. Right along major bus routes and within a mile of nice restaurants. For the price, this hotel was decent."
93,2026,"Aug 31 2008 	Not bad at all.	Stayed here for three nights on an extension to a mid west tour.Check in was done for us so no dealings with the desk. Our room was ok except for traffic noise, (I noticed the windows were single glazed so no wonder), the beds were fairly comfortable and I didn't notice any peeling wallpaper or carpet stains as others have mentioned.Breakfast was the usual buffet and no complaints. The windows there were double glazed so no traffic noise.The location we thought was not that good, ok you can get a bus outside but I would have prefered a hotel nearer Union Square or the Wharf. Getting around was easy though and we walked to the Wharf and Union Suare a few times although not at night.Tried Mel's opposite for a meal but was not impressed, food was only warm(as most food on this tour was)and the tip was included.It wasn't warm enough for us and didn't have the time to try out the pool.We probably won't come this way again but if we did we would stay at a more central hotel although we found this one not bad at all."
94,2026,Aug 30 2008 	Pleasant stay at the Cathedral	My friend and I had a most enjoyable experience staying at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. The location was such that we could maneuver the streets of San Francisco and yet find our way back to our room. That's very important if you've ever tried to drive in downtown San Francisco!The hotel room was immaculate and it was very quiet. Our room over-looked the courtyard. The hotel staff was always very friendly and helpful.The parking garage was a little crazy but I got the feeling that would be true for any of the parking garages. We were able to find spaces that were near the elevator going right in to the hotel.And another plus to this hotel - the parking fee was for &quot;in &amp; out&quot; parking. Evidently some places charge for parking each time you leave and for each time you returnWe would definately stay at this hotel again.
95,2026,"Aug 29 2008	OK Hotel in dodgy location	Firstly, no problems with hotel. Clean, comfortable, good coffee shop, restaraunt not too bad, a tad pricey but good quality.The main issue is location. It is about 7-8 blocks from Chinatown and Union Square, and the walk back takes you through some of the more seedy parts of the city. Definiately give it a miss during hours of darkness"
96,2026,Aug 28 2008 	Awful	This was awful experience from the time I checked in until I left. The man at the front desk was rude and took forever to check us in. I reserved a room with a queen size bed and was charged for a queen size bed yet I received a room with two doubles. The room was aboslutely filthy. The carpet in the hallways and in the room was so dirty and greasy that you could not take off your shoes. The sheets on the bed were very old and torn. The comforter had numerous ciggarette burns in it and felt dirty to touch. The couch also was filthy and greasy. After a long day of travel all I wanted was a place to sleep. My husband and I travel a great deal and we have never stayed in such an awful unclean room. I have never written a review and would not be doing so now but I do not want anyone to have to experience something as horrible as this. I honestly do not know how this hotel is passing health inspections. Please do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. There are many beautiful hotels in San Francisco.
97,2026,"Aug 27 2008	Good Budget Choice for San Francisco	Just spent 4 nights at this hotel with my 26 year old daughter. I chose the property because it was one of the only choices (combining air &amp; hotel) that had a room with 2 double beds as an option for a good price. Front desk staff were very efficient. We arrived in the early morning and they had us in our room by 11:00am. Our room, on the 5th floor, was just fine. A little dated perhaps, but clean with comfortable mattresses and pillows. No problem with the location as we purchased 3 day MUNI passes and the hotel is on the corner of 2 busy streets (Van Ness and Geary). We took the BART from the airport to the Civic Center and walked the rest of the way (about 13 blocks). The beginning of the California cable car line is close and easy to get on without waiting. We walked to Union Square the first day. Had one dinner at the hotel and it was nicer than expected. Staff throughout this hotel were pleasant and helpful (front desk, bell boy, cleaning staff, waiters) and our checkout took seconds. Took the shuttle back to the airport as it was reasonable. Cathedral Hill Hotel delivered as a good budget choice. (I have stayed in the tiny rooms around Union Square on previous trips.) Shopping in SF is fabulous and I would rather spend my money that way! If you are going in September 2008, be sure to see the Frida Kahlo show at the MOMA, ending on the 28th."
98,2026,"Aug 27 2008 	Overpriced for a run down hotel	I stayed there for 3 nights despite the mixed reviews I have read. The location is fine- I wouldn't say &quot;great&quot; since it's almost a mile walk to Union Square but there are a few bus stops near by since the hotel is located on major streets (Geary and Van Ness.)The hotel is run down and needs a major renovation! The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, stains on the carpet and cigarette burns on the tables, etc... The walls were so thin- I constantly heard the t.v. from next door and the toilet flushing.Other than that, the hotel is fine if you don't mind the decor and noise... just overpriced for what you get."
99,2026,"Aug 26 2008 	Only if you cannot find somewhere else	We stayed at this hotel for in August 2008. This hotel appears to have been built and decorated sometime in the 70's and has never been updated or improved. The staff were helpful and courteous. But, the carpet in our room was dirty and smelled. The linens were worn and all the fixtures were old and worn. It is a place to lay your head down at night only. I would not have wanted to spend time in the room or hotel. Their website makes the hotel look much nicer than it really is."
100,2026,"Aug 25 2008	Nothing good to say about this hotel	I spend many nights in hotels, and as such am probably more critical than most, but this hotel is really bad. From check-in to check-out there is nothing to commend it. Check-in itself took over 20 minutes, and then when we got to our room it had not been cleaned from the previous occupants. We spent the whole day away from the hotel, and after a wonderful meal at Scomer's on Fisherman's Wharf, when we got back we decided to end the evening with an Irish coffee. It was 10:45pm and the first thing we were told was to hurry up with our order because they were closing at 11pm. The Irish coffe was bitter, cold, and I'm certain they forgot the liqor. The night was punctuated with noise, and at one point at around 4 am some errant person was shouting profanities right outside our door, leading my wife not being able to sleep for the rest of the night. In the morning, check-out took 30 minutes whilst it seemed all of the front-desk staff were chatting and partying in the back office. A truly awful hotel to be avoided at all costs."
101,2026,"Aug 21 2008 	Pleasently suprised	We stayed here for 2 nights in the Family Deluxe room. The room was huge and the perfect size for 2 families traveling together. The room was clean and the staff were very nice. They even anticipated our need for extra towels and brought us several more than we actually needed without us asking.The location was perfect. There are really good restaurants right across the street and the public transportation was really convenient to the hotel and easy to use. The concierge was especially helpful in telling us how to get where we wanted to go.Breakfast in the hotel is okay. They brought us yogurt for the toddlers at no charge and the buffet food was only okay. The food is better if you order from the menu, but it takes forever. I was worried based on wome of the reviews, but overall it was really pleasent and I would stay here again."
102,2026,Aug 19 2008 	OK Stay at Cathedral Hill	I booked at Cathedral Hill because it was centrally located and parking was included in my room price. We had adjoining rooms and both were musty and very old. My room was much smaller than the kids and looked as if something (another bed?)had been removed before we got there. The pool was clean but the patio area lacked lounge chairs and any kind of ambience. The restaurant was decent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were disappointed with the area of San Francisco that the hotel was in. A lot of homeless and you could not walk the surrounding streets at night. Really unsafe!
103,2026,"Aug 17 2008 	Nothing Special	This average hotel offers nothing special. It's clearly in need of some updating. It is located on the main street into &amp; out of the city, but it also has lots of traffic surrounding it and pedestrians at all hours of the day/night making noise outside. I stayed 2 nights and was unable to get a good night either on either day. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Two great diners right across the street from this hotel."
104,2026,"Aug 11 2008 	Very good BUT - you have to pay extra for Internet...	The room was clean, rates are not bad for a hotel in SF, nearby restaurants are good (Tommy's Joynt http://www.tommysjoynt.com/ is right across the street) and everything else I needed (business trip) was handy, except...I wasn't prepared to pay $10/day for Internet use. Reportedly, this is common practice in SF, although not in most of the other cities I go to.All-in-all, a good experience. Next time I will put in the additional costs in my travel expense planning."
105,2026,Aug 10 2008 	Great hotel-we loved our stay!	We stayed at this hotel for two days while attending a benefit and found it to be way above average. The price was right and the location perfect for sightseeing. The bus line and cable car were conveniently located near the hotel. The room was very large and clean and the service excellant. The staff were polite and very accomodating and we lacked for nothing. I strongly recommend this hotel for families and singles and feel you will be very satisfied with your stay here. I will definately stay here again when visiting San Francisco!!
106,2026,"Aug 9 2008	Great location	This hotel was in a great spot near Japan town, Union Square and the fantastic gig venue The Fillmore. We had a brill holiday in San Francisco, staying in this hotel and beginning tours from it."
107,2026,"Aug 8 2008 	WHAT A DUMP	WHAT A DUMP we stayed here after an amazing week long stay in the Northern California area. It is a shame that we ended it with this hotel. The room was SMALL, dirty and all the staff were not helpful. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!!!!"
108,2026,"Aug 6 2008 	Cathedrale Hill Hotel Great Value	This hotel is great value for the money. Request a renovated room in the tower. The rooms are clean and extremely spacious. Our room had 2 queens, plus a living room area. It was overly large for a hotel room. Linens, etc... all great. The location is good, about a 15 minute walk to Union Square. We booked 2 rooms, 1 for us, and one our 2 kids, ages 20 and 22. If you're looking for 5 star, this is not the place for you. But don't let that deter you. Overall, we were actually surprised how satisfied we were, since the price was quite low. The rooms exceded our expectations. Can't go wrong with this hotel ! We definately recommend it."
109,2026,"Aug 1 2008 	Truly Awful Experience	Had been looking forward to my time in San Francisco following 4 weeks in New Zealand. Sadly my expectations were severely let down. Following a 25 hour trip from my hotel in Christchurch (NZ) to Cathedral Hill I was greeted by a surly receptionist. I may have blinked when he smiled, certainly an unwelcoming check in experience.On entry to my room i was greeted with a bottle of wine from a friend who'd contacted the hotel prior to my arrival, a very nice thought, however was slightly tarnished when the bottle which was chilled on ice with glasses had not been privided with a corkscrew!!My room, like the rest of the building felt out of place for 2008, run down and shabby. An old a/c unit that could be hard to switch on for those guests who may have problems with gripping things. The shower had no proper mixing ability so it was hit or miss whether you had a scalding or freezing shower. There was no form of sound proofing and the room was loud 24 hrs a day, not condusive for relaxing. The concierge's inabillity to help or actually organise anything is truly astounding. Everything I learnt came through experiencing it for myself or through taxi drivers and local bar or restarauntuers. One prime example was being bundled into a limo to a shopping centre a couple of blocks short from Fermans Wharf. This journey was assured to be the same price as a taxi, yet was $17 as apposed to the $12 it costs from the hotel to the wharf.The ability of the staff is not the highest, a prime example occured when trying to change some sterling travellers cheques, the receptionist did not understand until i explained that sterling is Great British Pounds and therefore required an exchange rate. They were only able to offer an exhange rate that was over a week old. Another example was when enquiring about wireless internet I was advised the process. when i pointed out that giving your credit card details over an unsecure network was ridiculous and risky i was greeted with a blaze attitude. Since my return to the UK I have seen other reviews of this hotel that draw attention to my biggest concern, the location of the hotel. Cathedral Hill is on the corner of Van Ness &amp; Geary. The location felt intimidating and seedy, several adult shops and massage parlours within an extremely short walk from the front door. There are also a large ammount of beggars in the area some of whom are agressive or intoxicated. I did not sample the bar or restaraunt because i felt less than inclined to give this hotel any more of the money I'd already paid to stay there, however was glad of the hotel's proximity to Mel's diner, a true american diner with great food &amp; service.I would not recomend this hotel in the slightest and would expect more for the price and rating. Highly dissapointing experience and not a great way to sample San Francisco"
110,2026,Jul 30 2008	Great Value	I stayed Friday night thru Monday. The room was very large. It is an older hotel but clean and very adequate. Bathrooms could use some updating but overall I have no complaints. Great location for downtown San Francisco. I would stay again.
111,2026,"Jul 10 2008 	Adequate	We stayed 4 nights and found everything fully acceptable.It is not overly plush but at the current room price is certainly value for money.If you are not driving buy a Muni pass (18 dollars for 3 days) and hop on and off buses,old trams,streetcars all day long (incredible value for money !).A bus stop is outside the hotel and the California Street tram a 5 minute walk away so exploring San Francisco is easy."
112,2026,"Jul 10 2008 	Great place!	We stayed here for two nights this week. Everything was great. Parking was easy, the elevators worked fine, the pool was clean and inviting, the shower/bathroom was clean, and the staff was very helpful. The location is centrally located so you can reach any destination easily. Shopping and restaurants are within walking distance. The room was quite large."
113,2026,"Jul 8 2008 	A Great Experience... Love the Cathedral Hotel	During our stay on July 4th and 5th 2008. We stayed at Cathedral Hill Hotel. We just thought we should write to let others know that we enjoyed our stay more than any time in recent memory thanks to the outstanding service we received.The professionalism that staff posed from the first day was beyond excellent customer service. The first contact was with the gentlemen that assisted with the luggage. These gentlemen were very helpful with maps and directions around the city throughout our stay. The lobby was clean and very receiving. The rooms were clean and housekeeping was very adaptable to our needs. The pool and Japan area was immaculate and inviting. We had the opportunity to enjoy your dining area of the Jack Tar Restaurant. We arrived 15 minutes prior to closing and ther staff treated us with the upmost courtesy. We did not feel rushed they were very courteous and professional. The food was excellent. We ordered the clam chowder which was the most delicious that we have ever tasted. We must recommend it to anyone who visits the area. The presentation of the soup was wonderful we really enjoyed the Laughlin soup bowl. As we write we would like to know where to purchase them. We have been searching on the internet since my arrival. The hotel was in walking distance of many of the cities attractions. There was a bus stop located in front of the Cathedral Hotel that would take you to the warf and North BeachOur stay was the most pleasant and we will let our friends and family know of how well we were treated while staying at your establishment. I would like to commend the management for choosing such a wonderful staff to employee. Thank you for providing us with a wonderful experience. Rest assured, we will be back again."
114,2026,"Jul 8 2008 	Our Home Away From Home	My family and I love this hotel. We have stayed here many times because the amenities and the staff are excellent. In fact, we spent our son's 4 year birthday at the Cathedral Hill because he loves it so much. Check-in is quick and painless. Balconies are hard to get but other requests are usually granted without problem. The rooms can be spacious and are reasonably priced. The beds have always been firm and comfortable. The bathrooms are clean and the towels are plush. The location is great because you are right in the middle of everything and can get to many of the tourist attractions by bus or even just walking. The pool and patio are excellent. The pool is heated and a great size for anyone with small children. The patio is spacious and has lots of places to sit from picnic tables to grass and all the lounge chairs in between. The room service is very nice. The menu is not large but so far everything we have ordered is delicious and delivered timely and at the correct temperature. We love this hotel and consider it our home away from home (especially with gas prices going through the roof)."
115,2026,Jul 4 2008 	A dump.	This place is a dump. Unless they have done some major renovations in the last 2 years. Filthy rooms. It is totally away from everything involving sightseeing. True a cable car does come by. Even the workers in the restu. talked about how shoddy the furniture was. We were very unhappy. I would try to stay by the Wharf or somwhere nice where there is something to see. like I said &quot;a dump&quot;.
116,2026,"Jul 4 2008 	Great Stay!	The decor says late 60s and the room decor was a little tired, but the room was incredibly spacious with big windows that open wide but keep the sound out when closed. The cleaning staff and front desk staff were professional and helpful. The lounge in the lobby is very old-style cool! Great location and great value for the price! I will return!"
117,2026,"Jul 4 2008 	1 year anniversary!	Went for 4 days to celebrate our 1 year anniversary! The room was a bit on the smaller side, but had a great lanai overlooking the cold pool.

119,2026,"Jul 1 2008 	Pricey and could be better	Just returned from San Francisco where we spent (4 of us) 5 nts at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. I had read some negative reviews before leaving and was very nervous about staying here. As previously pointed out it is a very large hotel and the area is most definitely awful, the only complaints we really had in our family room was that there were only ever enough towels left out for 2 people. Also we were unable to open the window. On the plus side the beds were very comfortable and the room was big enough for us. We had also stayed in LA the week previously and compared to that we found CHH overpriced for what we got. The pool area was nice, though we didn't actually get to use it which was another bone of contention, as we arrived back early on our final full day in order to have a swim and relax only to find there was a private pool party and we could not be admitted. I do feel guests should have been advised of this in advance. Not the sort of hotel you would pick if you want a quiet hotel either as it was very noisy, there was something going on every evening but we didn't mind that, there's plenty to look at, you may even bump into Elton John!! As someone previously recommended, 'Tommys Joynt' across the street was a big hit , not everybodys cup of tea but it definitely worked for us."

The main reasons I booked there was the incredible low price, which included free parking and a great free breakfast buffet. Also, the hotel was close to all major attractions. Upon arriving I thought I'd see Cecil B Demile filming an old movie. The lobby was right out of old Hollywood, and I took a 'Gloria Swanson' picture of my wife cascading down the huge staircase, ready for her 'closeup'. It was a lot of fun. I believe the rooms have been recently updated because ours was very nice and showed no signs of wear and tear at all. The shower was awesome with great water pressure and unlimited hot water. The room also had wireless internet available. The help was amazingly friendly. Overall. a terrific experience and if I ever go to San Franciso again I will most definitely stay there."
121,2026,"Jun 24 2008	Don't believe the info folder in your room	We stayed here also at the end of a tour. Overall it was ok but its position is not ideal as some of the streets surrounding are rather suspect and you wouldn't want to walk round the area after dark. The main problem we had was with the barman. Despite the information in our room, the hotel bar does not open after 11pm. We rate this as fairly pathetic for hotel guests and complained to reception the following day (in room info quotes 1am). We were told that the bar closes if no customers are there. However as there was a tour group of about 20 people it should have stayed open. The following evening (our last) we wanted a farewell drink with our fellow travellers but again the barman refused to serve us after 10.45. His arrogant reply was that our name was not on his pay check! Excuse me, as the customer I expect I am his employer! They obviously don't understand the saying that 'customer is always correct' in the US. Obviously we didn't leave any tips and we would advise anyone in a similar situation to buy your own bottles and sit on the patio &amp; serve yourself...Also the reception ladies toilets are fairly grotty!"
