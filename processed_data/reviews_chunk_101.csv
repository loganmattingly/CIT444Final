41,2101,Jun 24 2009 	Great location great stay.	We stayed at the Hyatt from 6/17-6/20. The front desk staff were very pleasant at all times and check in was quick alllowing access at 10am. The room was clean and furnished as all other Hyatts. They offer a complimentary mini fridge which was brought promptly. There is waher/dryer service on each floor. The hotel is next to the Hilton and across from the Holiday Inn Express. The location is great if you plan on spending a lot of time at the wharf. There is a cable car stop directly outside of the hotel (Powell/Mason). Walgreens is one block away if you need any incidentals and there are numerous great restaurants nearby. The Hollywood cafe is a great choice for breakfast and is directly outside the hotel. We walked to the Alcatraz pier to catch our boat and it was an easy 15 minutes walk. The go car rental is close by (on Hyde) and a great way to see the city. We had debated on staying at Fisherman's Wharf vs Union Square and are glad we made the choice we did. The taxi back to the airport was $45 and 30 minutes. They do have the option of taking a shuttle for $17pp with stops at other Hyatts for pick ups.
42,2101,"Jun 22 2009 	Nice hotel in a good location	My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights around the beginning of May. Location wise it is a block or so from the waterfront and a good 15 minute walk down to Fisherman's Wharf. However, the plus side is that it is out of the noisy yahooing crowds and we were never disturbed at night. The cable car stop (Powell-Mason line) was a block away and the nearest supermarkets were a couple of blocks away (go out of the hotel and turn right, take the 1st left onto Taylor and then left onto Bay. At the end of the block is a grocery store and then a Safeway and Walgreens about half a block along again).The room itself was really nice, large and had obviously been refurbished not long ago. Colours are blues, browns and greys so very contemporary. We had a huge bed with lovely linen and loads of pillows. There was also a couch in the room and a very large flat screen tv. We asked for a fridge to be in the room and there was a small one sitting on the floor - not sure why this has to be asked for I thought they were standard but obviously not anymore. There was heaps of storage room in drawers and cupboards. Only issue you might have if you were there on business is that the desk also doubles as the tv stand which didn't seem to leave a lot of room. There was a coffee maker thingie in the room with takeway cups which seemed to be handy (I don't drink much coffee so didn't try)The bathroom was large and the only complaint I would have is that the shower had a long glass screen but no door so water tended to get out onto the floor.The room was serviced well everyday.We had a drink one night in the bar which was fine although a little on the pricey side but then this is San Francisco. We didn't eat there but the food that was being delivered to the tables looked great.We ate breakfast across the road at both of the little cafes. Both served excellent food however, the one on the left seemed to do a variety of coffees rather than the standard filtered coffee but the one on the right had an additional fruit side that was wonderful so depends on what you want. Both had really good service and were clean and tidy."
43,2101,"Jun 18 2009 	Very nice hotel modern and cozy rooms	I liked this place. Despite being chic, upscale and expensive, it was very comfortable inside. We were on the pool level, right outside the jacuzzi area. I am a light sleeper and was concerned about this. Not a problem. The hotel is centrally located near fisherman's wharf and there's a Cost Plus across the street to stock up on provisions. The bed was awesome. Super soft with great linens. Very plush. The room is the 'modern' style of hotel room. Lots of neutral colors and small furniture. Not like an older hotel that might have wood chairs, etc. The bathroom had a shower with the head in the ceiling. I'm kinda tall, so I appreciated that, a lot. I usually have to lean over to wash my hair. We got the 'larger' room, which offered more space, but was still not huge by any means. The staff were totally friendly and helpful with any questions we had. They always greeted us and asked if there was anything they could do for us. They even provided a small fridge upon request, at no charge. The attached restaurant left something to desire, but I wasn't there to eat at a place like that. SF has a lot more to offer, within walking distance. Highly recommended. Would stay here the next time I visit as well."
44,2101,"Jun 16 2009 	As cold and grey as the weather outside...	First the pros: Comfy pillows. Nice flat screen TV. Friendly staff, especially the valet who served us courteously and with a smile every day. Great location, two blocks to touristy places and views on the wharf, one of those high tech public restrooms people flock to see as well as the Powell &amp; Mason trolley turnaround that will connect you to the two other trolley lines. There's a Starbucks on the same corner. As the desk clerk said &quot;There aren't a lot of views in a 5 story hotel. We are built on landfill so you can't get much higher without being in danger of earthquake damage&quot;. That being said, we took a room with a street view on the 4th floor and watched tourists and locals bustle, heard the dinging of the trolley which could be seen from our window, and had a decent view of Coit Tower to the left, and hillside homes to the right.Now the cons: Only a so-so lunch at the hotel restaurant Knuckles (we had a $25 credit there, otherwise we would have hit the wharf for fresh seafood - good sweet potato fries but the tortilla soup was lacking and the crab cake sandwich was fishy and dry. Our waitress was very nice.) Parking is $45 per night. Ouch, but that rate is pretty standard. Tip - some hotels will throw in the parking as a special offer.This place could use some updating. Single pane windows made for a noisy evening with emergency vehicles passing by but things quieted down enough to sleep before it got too late. We always knew when our neighbors were coming and going and watching television. The hallways are poorly lit and painted in some back in the day shade of green. The decor is in blue-grey tones with chocolate accents. It might have been modern in the early 90s, but now it just feels cold and dreary. It wasn't very clean and the lighting was poor. The clock was broken. The a/c intake cover was falling off.All in all, San Francisco is such an incredible city that the hotel stay was secondary. I wish we would have tried the Hilton next door because I know we could have done better. Give Sabella and LaTorre a try for a casual historical dining experience on the wharf. Ask for a window seat so you can watch the passersby at the open air seafood market outside."
45,2101,"Jun 10 2009 	Great Property Friendly staff excellent location	I arrived around 8:30 pm local time and was greeted by a very polite valet person. He was friendly and directed my inside. The lobby is a bit odd and is set-up in the new fashion without a counter, just a table at check in. The guy working check in was even better than the valet, was incredibly friendly, let me know my room was indeed quite and was in fact upgraded to a suite.Please see my blog at http://talesfromtheroad-mwalno.blogspot.com/The room is awesome, and the thing that surprises me is how quite it really is......I walked into the restaurant/bar and there were quite a few people there, it look nice with several big screens, and a lively atmosphere. It is located 3 blocks from the warf and I recommend Scomas for dinner there.I can't stand the Grand Hyatt here, and this really is a great property, I will stay here every time I come to town!!!!"
46,2101,"Jun 9 2009 	Nothing great - parking is a ripoff!	There is nothing warm about this Hyatt - the inside area like the front of the elevators, coridors, etc are dark giving a dingy feeling and with dark carpets, it adds to the dismal look.Beds are fine with the rooms being smallish, nothing to look at out of the window - you will see the windows of the across the street buildings. They have valet parking at $45 plus tax and the internet is $10. When is Hyatt going to realise that wifi is here to stay and is getting cheaper everywhere - most of the hotels today offer it free and with the high room rates paid here why cant they include free wifi? There are lots of other fine hotels nearby on this street and they offer cheaper parking."
47,2101,"Jun 8 2009 	Great for Leisure; Bad for Conferences	This place has a bipolar personality. The hotel was excellent; the conference center -- not so much.The hotel has a great, central location, blocks from the great restaurants of Fishermans Wharf and North Beach. We received five different dinning recommendations from the hotel staff. All were very good! The hotel is smallish so no Regency Club exists at this property. Surprisingly, the restaurant had the lowest prices I have found at any Hyatt and conference guess receive and additional 20 percent off! Knuckles Restaurant service was good except Friday morning when we had to wait a good while for our server to show up. When she did get to our table (after we got our own drinks) she said they were having a meeting. Unfreakinbelievable!!! You would think the meeting would have happened BEFORE Knuckles opened.Dont drive a car here unless you are traveling on business. No self parking. Moreover, valet is $45/per day. If you park overnight on the street, you will be sorry. We found lots of broken of glass from car burglaries along the curb on North Point Street just east of the hotel.The rooms are very nice and the housekeeping is outstanding. Although there is no turndown service, the rooms are apparently freshened twice per day. I would dash up to the room at lunch to change for a quick workout and shower then return in the evening to find fresh towels, a clean shower and my workout clothes stowed away. Many reviewers complained about the doorless showers (a glass partition only partially separates the shower from rest of the bathroom). Though some reviewers said the bathroom floor got wet, I believe one would need to try really hard to get water on the bathroom floor.The staff was friendly. Everyone smiled and gave the greeting of the day.The conference center is nice but the service is horrible. We had a great continental breakfast set up every morning and cookies or some other confection in the afternoon. Unfortunately, ice water was rarely available. To make matters worse, many times we had no water at all! A co-worker told me that the coffee ran out too! I complained to the servers or hosts twice and complained to the front desk also. The situation did not improve throughout the week. This is totally unsatisfactory! I do not recommend booking a conference here."
48,2101,"May 24 2009 	Nice Room Easy Walk to Fisherman's Wharf	I stayed for three days in this hotel while staying in SF for work. I was one of 3 colleagues (each had our own room). The hotel was very nice - the staff quite helpful in pointing you to where things are, how to get around, etc. There is a complimentary hotel car available to take you places in the city (e.g. we used it to reach business meetings on market street) - just be sure to speak with the concierge/front desk to ensure it's lined up for you. The rooms were very spacious for a city room, although we all had inner-facing views from the window - meaning the bad news is you had no view of the street, but the good news is no noise from the street. :) Two of us suffered allergies while there, so I'm not sure if it was from something in the room or from being in SF (we are from the East Coast). The linens and bedding are all comfortable - typical of Hyatt. Also typical - there is no free wireless internet, but there is a small room near the front desk that you can plug your laptop in for free (if you have an ethernet cable), plus a desktop &amp; printer to permit you to print out your boarding passes prior to going to the airport. I did not use the hotel gym since I preferred to run outside in the city, but there supposedly is a gym and a pool available to you. As always, I find the lack of complimentary breakfast frustrating at most Hyatts, this one no exception.I do not particularly like the Fisherman's Wharf area since it's too touristy for me; however you can walk about 10-15 mins up Columbus to the Italian area (I do not recall the name) where there are a number of quaint and quite good restaurants. Also, the F tram is just one block away, so you have easy access to public transportation in terms of getting downtown. There are a number of competing hotels all within 1-2 blocks (Holiday Inn, Express, Sheraton, Marriot, etc.) so there are good options at your disposal in the event the Hyatt doesn't work for you."
49,2101,"May 24 2009 	So-So	We stayed here for my 30th birthday a couple of years ago (late review) as a splurge since we usually opt for a more budget-friendly hotel when we come to SF. We payed $300 for one night and weren't immensely impressed with the service or our room. The room itself was ok, the bathroom was incredible but our view was less than spectacular. There was a slight mix up when checking in concerning the particular size bed we'd reserved. We had reserved a king and somehow ended up with two doubles. It was quickly resolved and because of the mix up we were given two vouchers for the breakfast buffet next door at the sports bar/restaurant called Knuckles. THAT was fantastic! It was very good.Overall I think there are far better hotels to pick from to stay in San Francisco. Upon finding a better deal we would entertain the thought of staying here again."
50,2101,"May 24 2009 	pre cruise	my wife and i stayed here for two nights before boarding a cruise ship ,you could not get a better location for this.we did not eat in the hotel so money places to eat at fishermans warf 5 mins away.we had no problems with the hotel or the staff.cable car 5 mins away , we would stay here again."
51,2101,"May 21 2009 	Touristy Location	Nice hotel, great rooms, greate service,but a very touristy location, given the fact that it is located in a very sophisticated city. Cabs or trains were necessary to get to any of the interesting locations. Price was reasonable."
52,2101,"May 10 2009 	A very nice stay in San Francisco!	We stayed in the Hyatt for three nights from april 30 until may 3rd and we loved the hotel! The room was very nice, with a wonderful king bed, big tv and great bathroom with an excellent shower. We overlooked the pool, which looked great, but we didn't use it.We booked the Hyatt through priceline and for the $65 a night we paid this was a great value. The location was great, only a 5 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf.I rate this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 because they charge you $45 plus tax a night for parking, which I thought was really expensive. They also charge you $10 for using the internet. If they would change these things, I'd definatly give them the fifth star!"
53,2101,"May 9 2009 	NIce hotel	We stayed at the Hyatt from the 24th - 29th of April at the end to a 22 day trip to Vegas/ LA/ Cambria/ Monterey. We booked through Priceline for $65/ night plus tax. We were given room 491 on the 4th floor.As this hotel charged $45/ night for car parking and San Francisco is famed for it's public transport we dropped off our car after arriving. The parking attendant was more than happy for us to get checked in and take our bags up to our room and leave the car outside while we did this at no charge. At check in we were given the type of room we had asked for although the check in clerks couldn't be described as overly friendly. The hotel itself is very nice and clean.The bellman took our (4 large) bags up to our room quickly for us and we headed back out (stopping to ask the concierge the best way to the car drop off location - he was helpful and gave us a map).Our room was a good size and everything was very clean the whole time we were there. We were in an internal room, which overlooked the pool area, so it was probably a bit darker than other rooms but very pleasant (and i'm picky). We asked for a fridge and at no expense it was delivered to our room within 15 minutes. The bathroom is a good size and the shower lovely (nice tiles/ good size).The only thing I didn't like about the room was the fact that the bathroom door was a sliding door and therefore there was space at each side that you could see in. Now, I was only with my husband but still, I prefer the door to fully close! Also, they charge for internet access, which in this day and age is penny pinching so we didn't use it.If you want free internet access (and have a laptop) there is a starbucks just around the corner from the hotel where you can pick up a signal (and they do $3.99 coffee and breakfast roll deals).The location of the hotel was good for the cable car, just one street behind on the Hyde &amp; Mason line and a few blocks along for the other line. It was also 2 blocks from Fisherman's Wharf.Overall this hotel was good for the price we paid, I wouldn't pay the price on their website ($200/ night for the dates we were there) but it's in a perfect location for Fisherman's Wharf - if you want to stay there. If we went back again i'd stay elsewhere as the area was dead after 10pm every night, all the cafe's etc on Pier 39 closed down at this time on a Sat night?! There were also a large number of homeless people around, although this seems to be a SF problem in general, nothing to do with the hotel."
54,2101,"May 4 2009 	Convenient Location Nice Rooms But Thin Walls	I liked the location, which is convenient to cable car lines and restaurants. The room was nice and comfortable, but on the downside, I could hear my neighbors' conversations. I got a very good rate through Hotwire.com, so I am not complaining."
55,2101,"May 2 2009 	Clean modern central but the parking fee was astronomical.	We booked this hotel on Hotwire for $99 per night which I was happy with. We found the hotel very modern and stylish. Check in was easy. The rooms were very attractive with plasma TV. My biggest gripe would be they only had 2 x double beds. It would have been preferable to have queens which we got everywhere else we stayed during our 3 week US jaunt. However, they were very comfortable. When our bags were delivered the bell hop suggested we order a complimentary in room fridge (he saw all the alcohol we had in the bags I take it). This was ordered and delivered in 10 minutes. The bathroom was nice. We overlooked a quiet courtyard and our room was very sunny. The kids used the pool and our friends raved about the on site gym. We had breakfast at the restaurant one morning. It was buffet style, but quite a small selection. However omlettes were cooked to order and the chef made my daughter waffles although they weren't on the menu. Very good service here also. The location is an easy walk to Fisherman's Wharf, right past a Denny's 24 hour restaurant. There is plenty of food choice around here. We had no trouble finding the cable car stop closeby. Aside from the $45 + tax per night parking fee this was a very positive experience for us all. Our party of 8 were glad we chose Fisherman's Wharf as opposed to a Union Square hotel."
56,2101,"Apr 26 2009 	Its ok but not sure how this hotel scores so well	On the plus side good location, helpful &amp; friendly staff and half price car parking.Less positivethe room had very little natural light, was very dinging and had a slightly depressing feel. The lighting in the bathroom was pretty poor. Pictures of the hotel show a games area with a pool tablewhich hasnt existed since Jan 09On balance..OK"
57,2101,"Apr 22 2009 	very nice experience at Fishermans Wharf	Stayed for three nights in April. Reserved through PL, received a twin double room. I asked for a change to a King Room, and although I paid a very low rate the staff seemed to take my request seriously and despite the hotel was pretty crowded they moved us after one day.Good:- nicely renovated rooms/bathrooms- convenient working desk- good exercise room/pool- guest laundry- location (if you want to stay at Fishermans Wharf)- quiet- self check-in kiosk, also providing the functionality to print boarding passesnot so good:- internet connection for 9,95 USD via T-Mobile. While connection was perfect in my first room, it was not 100% stable in the second room- no mini bar - in standard king rooms, no chair/sofa provided (twin double have 2 chairs, larger Kings have a sofa) except at working desk- no self-parking in hotel garage, they offer self parking in a garage nearby (13$ cheaper than hoel valet)There is an onsite restaurant: Knuckles Sports Bar and Grill. Although being a sports bar the food was very good and provided a very nice menu (also for vegetarians). I would definetely recommend the Knuckles. The very warm welcome from an exceptionally friendly gentleman has been the perfect start for a casual little dinner with consistent food quality both times we ate there.Overall: very good choice in this part of San Francisco. I do not think you will be disappointed."
58,2101,"Apr 20 2009 	Loved by our entire group	The Hyatt at Fisherman's Warf was used by our Board of Directors for a few days in early April. This hotel could not be more accomodating to each of us. From recommendations to directions to personal service, we felt very catered to. Fisherman's Warf is very touristy, but the Hyatt's location was ideal- a few blocks to anything, including cable cars, alcatraz and the waterfront. It's a small Hyatt and very nicely decorated. Felt like a boutique hotel. The heated outdoor pool was nicely hidden from the street and looked fun to all who used it. We had a great time- thank you!"
59,2101,"Apr 14 2009 	Good Hotel- Terrible Parking	Difficult to rate this hotel for a couple of reasons..Got a rate of $65 / night over Easter weekend using PL. So I definitely got a good value.Had I paid $190 plus $52/ night to park ala their website- I would have been pretty furious.We arrived on a Friday at 2 pm- seems like a time when you need a lot of help at valet- since there is no self park. There was one guy parking and doing bags. The check in woman tried to help us with our bags, The people were great- but under staffed as could be. Our bags were in our room one hour later. Next day I needed to get tix out of my car- I left and went to lunch- took way too long. It was an obvious problem- and unacceptable considering the price to parkOn the plus side- it is a great location, nice rooms friendly room service and lots of shopping outsideHollywood cafe next door was GREAT for breakfastps- why do they have to charge $10/ day to use TMOBILES *******py internet service. For $230/ night average- they could give you some good ole free internet?? I didnt realize anyone still charged..."
60,2101,"Apr 12 2009 	Excellent location. Good service. Outrageous parking fees. Slow service at restaurant.	We just came back from a 3 night stay at this Hyatt, and we enjoyed it well enough. I had booked a deluxe suite directly from Hyatt's website, and felt a bit foolish not to be using priceline, but since we must have a suite, this was the only way to guarantee one. Anyway, the first suite we had was a very large corner unit with huge window. We loved it until I tried to take a bath. Huh? What? No tub. Yup. Imagine that. To top it off, it has one of those &quot;European&quot; showerheads which shoots water from the ceiling directly onto your head. (By the way, I've been to 7 European countries and not once did I see this type of showerhead.) Moreover, the shower has no doors, just a glass half wall. And the seal on that wall isn't great, so water was leaking onto the water on the other side. And the door (sliding style) to the bathroom was so heavy, I had trouble using it. I called the front desk and asked to be moved to another suite with a tub, only to be told that all the deluxe suites have the European showers. Hm! Well, I hated it enough to take a smaller room. In hind sight, I should have insisted on a rate reduction. And yes, I should have just booked on priceline.We ate at the restaurant for breakfast twice, and the food was so so. Service was impossibly slow though. I could have made the whole meal myself, leisurely eat, read the paper, and finish all the dishes in the same amount of time. I suppose they're used to have tourists order the buffet than just individual orders.The pool was clean and warm. Hardly anyone was in it until the afternoon. It was only 3 feet deep, so there were a lot of kids in it. The jacuzzi was tiny and was too &quot;foamy&quot; for my taste, so I didn't get in at all.Like others have mentioned, parking was $45/day plus 14% tax ($6.30). There are several parking lots nearby for anywhere between $10-$35/day. Since I didn't know how secure they were, I didn't want to be penny wise but pound foolish.Overall, we liked it well enough and may return in the future. I'll bid next time though."
61,2101,"Apr 11 2009 	Very modern and clean	I stayed at the Hyatt for two days and it was a good experience. We had a king size room with a flat screen tv, desk, king bed, and we received a newspaper daily. The staff was friendly and courteous. We were not too far away from Fisherman's Wharf about a few blocks walking distance. We paid for a room package deal that included valet parking which was great. I would definitely stay here again."
62,2101,"Apr 7 2009 	Highly recommended hotel in great location	I stayed at the Hyatt, Fishermans Wharf for 5 nights.I arrived at the hotel at 10:45 am after a 14 hour flight and was very pleasantly surprised to be able to check in immediately. The Hyatt's self check-in is second to none. All you do is to run your credit card through the card reader and your booking details are displayed on the large LCD check-in screen. Your room key card is immediately delivered to you.The room I had requested (Twin non-smoking) was provided. The rooms are of a standard hotel layout with the bathroom off to the left, wardrobe space to the right, leading into the bedroom. The decor was minimalist, but the comfort of the beds was exceptional, as were the two chairs provided. A large desk and LCD TV completed the furniture. Lighting was plentiful, though the elderly might have some difficulty in manipulating the small turn switches on the lamps. The bathroom towels, shampoo soap etc were all of a high standard. The only thing I wasn't too keen on were the carpets: dark brown and highly patterned.The hotel is located within easy walking distance of the attractions of Fishermans Wharf, street car terminus, shops etc. I also walked a couple of times to Union Square, an interesting 28 minute journey via Chinatown. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were delightful. I will definitely stay there again when I am in San Francisco. Highy recommended!"
63,2101,"Apr 5 2009 	Parking Fees killed me but great hotel.	We ( my fiance and I) drove up from Los Angeles and stayed 3 nights at the Wharf Hyatt. This was a wine tasting trip for us.I was able to get a great price of $308 for 3 nights through the &quot;bidding website.&quot;The hotel had my reservation per my request as a non-smoking King bed, but I was given a non-smoking with two fulls. Boo. My fiance and I scrunched together and slept fine in their wonderful bed, but I was unhappy that all they could offer me was a smoking King room, or the two fulls after I made a request for the non-smoking king.The Hyatt's Restaurant and Bar Knuckles was fantastic, and I called ahead of time to get a good table for 6 and they accommodated us wonderfully. Try the Blue Moon Belgium Beer. YUM! The Fried Salmon was not very good in my opinion but the meals the others had were all amazing. For the price, I felt the values at Knuckles were outstanding.All in all the Hotel was nice, but the Holdiay Inn Express across the street offered free breakfast, free wireless internet, and overall more for the money, but not quite the class.My biggest gripe was the parking fees. Not only do they charge $45 per 24 hours for guests, they add a 14% tax on top of that ($6.50 per day) so three days cost me $153 and change to park my car. OUCH!I guess the pool was heated and they also had a jacuzzi that we did not use, but we looked at the gym which was small but good, and FREE to guests."
64,2101,"Apr 2 2009 	Friendly Staff 	We spent a girls weekend here. I was not sure what to expect since there are so many mixed reviews. I booked through Priceline and got an exceptional rate. I cant say enough about how friendly the staff is at this hotel. I called about a half an hour after booking to try and see if we could get a room with 2 queen beds. The young lady I spoke with in reservations was more than accommodating and had a super fun personality. Since it is my usual experience that most hotels wont guarantee anything until you actually check in, I was surprised they would do this for us. Check in was a breeze. Under 5 minutes. Even though the gal at the desk was on the phone and had another employee waiting to speak with her. It was multi-tasking at its finest. She saw that I had our paperwork in hand so she waived me over and started the process while finishing her phone call. Once she hung up she politely asked us for one minute while she finished her conversation with her fellow employee (she finished up with him in 30 seconds). My usual experience is that if the person at check-in is on the phone or otherwise occupied, they make you stand there FOREVER while they finish the task at hand. Once she turned her full attention to us, she was funny and engaging. They did not even charge us the extra person fee (there were 3 of us and we only booked for 2). We felt very welcome and that our business was appreciated. This hotel is a great location. Its a short walking distance to the bus, cable cars, etc. Our room was just OK. It was a little worn but I attribute that to it being a smoking room. The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. We didnt order room service or any extras so I cant comment on it. We ate Knuckles (the hotel restaurant) for dinner. They recently remodeled and changed their menu (used to be a sports bar). It was excellent. It's the best service I have ever experienced. Our waiter really went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed our meal. Again, he had a super fun personality and made us feel like our business was appreciated. At the end of our meal, the manager stopped by our table to inquire how we were enjoying our stay/meal and to thank us for staying with them. I used to travel for work. I have stayed in hotels all over the country and, all I can say is, WOW! That has never happened to me before.Check- Out was a breeze too. Under 5 minutes we were in a Taxi on our way to the airport. Every single employee we encountered during our short stay was friendly, polite and had a sunny disposition. I think you would be hard pressed to find a cranky person working there. It was well worth the money and I would definitely stay here again. There wasn't anything I disliked about my experience."
65,2101,"Mar 19 2009 	Great Location - Great Staff - Clean!	We stayed at Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf for 3 nights just recently and found the hotel to be nicely located and with a great staff. We got a great deal through Priceline so we can't complain. We were given a 2 doubles bedroom near the elevator and facing the entry parking. The elevator actually didn't bother us but we can hear the people from the parking valet area in the morning. That didn't really bother us much either since we were out sightseeing most of the day. The only drawback for this place is the parking fee. Hyatt charges $45 a night (with in-out access). The closest parking lot charges $32 a night with no in-out access. On the night of arrival, we paid for the $32 a night parking since it was late but every night after that, we were able to find off-street parking for free. You just need to make sure you read the signs since some streets have street cleaning and no parking is allowed at certain times. You also will need to get up by 7 to take the car or else you will need to feed the meter. The room itself was great: roomy, clean and recently renovated. We didn't try the restaurant since there are too many options in San Fran. They do have a heated pool but we didn't have time to try that out since it drizzled while we were there. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and for the price we paid, we loved it."
66,2101,"Mar 19 2009 	Fantastic location just a stones throw from the lovely Fishermans Wharf	We stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights and found the location to be perfect. It was right down there on Fishermans Wharf. Check in was swift and courteous. The room was much as you would expect from a Chain hotel, with lovely complimentary toiletries in the bathroom. We had a huge very comfortable bed. Cable car stop is just around the corner too. Would definately stay there again if we get to go back to San Francisco. (They also have smoking rooms) which was a bonus for us smokers as most hotels we stopped in were totally non smoking."
67,2101,"Feb 18 2009 	Great Location... Nice Hotel	This was a nice hotel, but it was lacking. Rooms were small. No bathrobes, as we were told there would be. No dresser... only 2 drawers and a small closet. Had to pay for internet service available through the hotel TV for $10/day. If you want WiFi through your laptop, you have to pay and have a T-Mobile Account. High fee for parking. We weren't able to use the pool or spa as it was raining during our stay, but the pool area was nice. The beds were very comfortable. This is an older hotel, that has had a recent makeover. The furnishings, carpet, decor is all nice, but the walls are thin and we could hear every footstep in the hall, above us, and on either side. Loud. I won't stay here again. It was just OK."
68,2101,"Jan 25 2009 	Good location. Nice overnight stay.	We stayed here during a quick overnight trip to the city to see a show.Our room was missing towels (there was only one bath towel), extra toilet paper, and coffee cups for the in-room coffee maker, but they responded quickly when we called to request them. Beds were a little soft for me. We didn't order any extras, so I can't comment on that, and we avoided the steep parking rate by parking on a nearby street.Overall, a good stay -- great location, friendly staff, and the room was nice. We also got a great deal by bidding on PL."
69,2101,"Jan 23 2009 	Fantastic Location - Nice Room - Worth the Price	Location is key for me (age 29) and my husband (age 36). This hotel is 2 blocks from the famous Fisherman's Wharf sign and all the activity and food you can stand. We were able to walk to Alioto's, the Alcatraz cruise, Golden Gate cruise, the start of an awesome Segway tour, Lombard Street, Pier 39, bike rentals, shopping, street car stops, trolley lines, and tons of fantastic street entertainment. The Hyatt offers all the amenitites including a medium-sized, outdoor pool and hot tub that you'll never use because you'll be off exploring the area. If price is an issue there was a holiday inn express across the street, but if you can swing it, the Hyatt's customer service was A+. Knuckles Bar (normally attached to hotel) was under construction when we were there, but they did put TVs in the breakfast area to watch the Steelers game. It wasn't the same, but again, they made the extra effort."
70,2101,"Jan 19 2009	awesome location!	The hotel is beautiful and in a great location. Everything you need is walking distance. The parking is very expensive, but we made friends with the parking guy and he told us that if we drive one block to Jones, there is free parking on the street and if we are lucky and go at the right time we could gat a spot. It is pretty limited but we did get a spot 2 nites in a row. It was a very short walk."
71,2101,"Jan 2 2009 	Good hotel but watch for hidden costs	This was our 2nd hotel on our Round the World tour. It is a modern hotel, looks quite smart and well situated near Fishermans Wharf in San Fran. Initially we were well pleased but once we settled in we became aware of one or two problems which people need to be aware of.Firstly the hotel claim to offer tea and coffee making facilities. True, they do offer it but you have to pay 10 dollars each time you use the facility as you can only use their coffee packets etc. Once made up you have to drink it or it becomes strong and horrid so it is an expensive mug of coffee. Also, the dining room is quite nice but dreadfully noisy particularly on match nights as it becomes packed with people watching the games. There is no other facility to eat other than room service. One would have thought a hotel this size could have offered a place to have a peaceful dinner.The internet service offered was the most expensive of all the hotels costing us almost 30 dollars a day. Ouch! The Holiday Inn across the road from us was advertising free internet access. If only we had known we could have saved a lot of money.We were given a room which had an adjoining door. Beware if they give you one. Our next door guests decided to put the T.V. on and make noisy phone calls at 4am. Sleep was impossible. When I complained the hotel staff offered us another room but as we only had one night left if didnt seem worth moving all our gear so we stayed put. Big mistake! There was a repeat performance.Finally, we checked out by using the hotel T.V. check out which promised to e mail the receipt. We couldn't open the receipt on our laptop and despite the fact that I e mailed and told the hotel this we never received a reply so to this day we don't know the full details of our account. Not good!"
72,2101,"Dec 9 2008 	Thanksgiving Getaway	The Hotel was a great pick. It is located in the heart of Fisherman's Whart area. Close to cable car and piers. Hotel has been recently renovated and it was extremely clean. The accommodations, conciege and service was excellent. We spent 5 days and 4 nights in this very comfortable hotel.We would highly recommend it."
73,2101,"Dec 5 2008 	good location	Lovely boutique smaller hotel, rooms nice and comfy but quite small with 3 guests and luggage.Very close to fishermans wharf and all the shops and cafes along water front.5 min walk to cable car to business centre. Nice hotel, god price thru expedia in AUD."
74,2101,"Dec 2 2008	Close to good stuff	Close to bus, train, wharf, bike rental etc.. I am one of the few that hates San Francisco; bums, stench, cold, crowded, who needs it, but if I have to stay (or in this case if someone else is paying) I will suffer through it for an Irish coffee at the Buena Vista, which is walking distance from this hotel."
75,2101,"Dec 2 2008 	Good location and quality	The hotel is nicely located close to fishermans wharf and the pier 39. The room was very nice with flat screen tv and a good working-bench for my computer. Quite big room with two queen beds.It is just one block away from one of the old cable-cars and just 2-3 blocks from the F-line that goes around the boardwalk.You can use a jacuzzi, pool, fitness room and in each corridor there is a washing-machine and a dryer that you can use for like 1,5 dollar. Also there is a vending-machine with some snacks and sodas for around 1 dollar."
76,2101,"Nov 29 2008 	Hotel is so so	Make sure bring extra cash for the add ons. Like parking, water bottles and the internet. However the coffee was great. Also there is a small work out room. I paid 152.00 plus tax and the parking was 45.00 plus tax. The taxes ranges between 6.00 - 8.00."
77,2101,"Nov 7 2008 	Great Hotel Great Holiday	I always check Tripadvisor for help in choosing the right hotel, and you certainly didn't let me down with this one..!!Just come back from one of the best holidays in US. San Francisco is a lovely city with lots to do and see. This hotel is well situated for Fishermans Wharf, a couple of blocks away from all the attractions, Alcatraz ferry, cable cars etc, but on a fairly quiet road. Staff were brilliant and friendly. We got a Kingsize bed in a good size room with a nice shower! Shops are handy, and hotel had laundry facilities if needed. Another review recommended the Hollywood Cafe opposite and I would do the same - we ate breakfast there every morning and cannot fault the food or the service - although we didn't try the hotel restaurant (Knuckles) we heard/saw some poor reviews and the Hollywood served up great food.Cable cars are very close - the Hyde line goes from outside the Argonaut Hotel and gets very crowded.....go to the Mason line at the back of the Hyatt and there are no / little queues that we experienced.Only let down was the shuttle service recommended by Expedia (Supershuttle) - where the driver could not speak english and took two hours to find our hotel after nearly killing us on more than one occasion......other than that I would highly recommend SF and the Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf.Mark Young (London)"
78,2101,"Nov 5 2008 	Great Place for the Wharf	Probably the most comfortable bed i have slept in, despite jet lag we slept like logs, staff very friendly and accommodating, concierge service excellent, very close to Fisherman's wharf which wqas exactly waht we expected, touristy, quirky and a bit tacky, but so what you're on Holiday. Taking advice from others we breakfasted at the Hollywood cafe, it was a lot smaller than I anticipated but the service was excellent and the breakfast was the benchmark for all others on our trip, it was never bettered. On eof our party suffering with jet-lag turned up at 6-45 am and was told &quot;We don't open until 7-00 but come in and have a coffee while you wait&quot;!! The imtationtram tour bus just round the corner is recommended , knowledgable and entertaining guide anda good value trip."
79,2101,"Oct 27 2008 	Good hotel but it's in Fisherman's Wharf	Unlike most of the hotels on North Point, the Hyatt retains some character from the original buildilngs. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, although I noticed one party leaving the walk-in restaurant after about five minutes and not being served. I was eating in there at the time and my experience was fine. Our room was a little larger than average and the outside wall was completely windowed (looking on to the pool area). The furnishings were modern and mostly shades of dark brown. Despite having a large flat screen TV, the picture quality was terrible. The hotel seems to have been recently refurbished, but the bathroom and light fixings looked as if they'd seen better days. The shower looked modern, with the water coming from a nozzle in the ceiling, but wasn't that fantastic in practice. The bed was huge, but the mattress could probably do with being replaced. On the plus side the room was quiet, clean and well furnished, the coffee machine was a boon and being by the pool area was very convenient. I guess it's par for the course to charge for everything in the room in that sort of area, including internet and bottled water, but there are guest laundry facilities (if you're so inclined). This was my first time to SF, and on reflection would not recommend Fisherman's Wharf to friends thinking of staying in the city - it's tacky, very touristy and disappointing. I intend to go back to the city and stay at the Embarcadero Hyatt on Market - a more interesting part of town and far easier to reach from SFO on the BART."
80,2101,"Oct 24 2008 	Excellent but not 100% service	We stayed here in April 2008 Myself, Mum, Grandma and we all loved it. The location is a great place for exploring around the Wharf area and it's easy enough to get to the city centre. The room was tastefully decorated as was the bathroom and the tea, coffee, toiletries etc was all great quailty. It felt luxurious, something from a magazine and the staff were all lovely. So the problem? Someone had obviously wet the bed and it reaked where it had warmed up!! I felt disgusted that I'd slept in it (without realising untill I woke up) , even my PJs smelled; sooo gross. We spoke to head of housekeeping who apologised and said she'd adjust our bill. I know that this isn't the hotels fault but I don't understand how it wasn't noticed when preparing the room or if they did notice and hoped we wouldn't. Also the bill adjustment was half off the room price, considering that room was now unrentable, I had to get my stuff washed etc and we spent so much on parking and internet access with the hotel (not real luxuries IMO) that it didn't affect the overall bill that much Id have liked better compensation. Just for how disgusting and inconvenient it was. Perhaps because we didn't push the complaint hard, we tried to be understanding but express that it wasn't good enough.I know this won't happen to many people but I deducted 1/5 for the fact that I wasnt 100% happy that it was allowed to happen in the first place and that the compensation for it could have been better.Overall it's a freat location and hotel and I don't think they are used to any complaints! If you can get a deal don't even question it, go here, but if you do have an issue be firm."
81,2101,"Oct 19 2008 	Great Location...amazing hotel!	The Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf was amazing. The beds are comfy, the rooms are clean and very quiet. We stayed for 5 days and didn't want to be eating out the entire time so we requested a refridgerator and went to safeway (just a couple blocks away) to buy some groceries to save on a few breakfast meals and snacks. During our stay we went to see Beach Blanket Babylon, it's a hilarious play and we'd recommend it to anyone. Overall, we had a great time in San Fran and loved our hotel."
82,2101,"Oct 18 2008 	Lovely Hotel	We stayed at the Hyatt Fishermans Wharf in Sep/Oct 2008we found the hotel to be very nice in a fantastic location, the rooms were very clean with beds and pillows very soft just what you need after a day sightseeing. We ate once at the hotel restrurant but felt that we were ripped off a bit, the buffet was about $18 and the fruit was tinned not what we expected so didn't go back again. The staff are all very friendly and greet you every time that they see you. There is a gym and a swimming pool but can't comment on them as we never had chance to use them. We would recommend this hotel to anybody that is thinking of going to San Fransisco, and would go back to this hotel againif we were in the area"
83,2101,"Oct 18 2008 	Close to Perfect Hotel!	Cleanliness and Friendliness must be their mission and they excel in both. The location is great. Rooms are spacious, amenities are good, but more than that - every single person on staff greets you - smiles and makes you feel welcome, of course, we felt that throughout San Francisco. They appreciate and understand the value of tourism dollars. Didn't eat at the restaurant - too many choices close by and didn't want something ordinary. Love the fact that the fitness room is open 24 hours unlike most hotels who experience the 6am rush and then there is not enough machines for everyone. Wouldn't even think of trying another hotel after such a nice experience."
84,2101,Oct 8 2008 	Loved the Hyatt!	My husband and I travelled to California last May and our 2-night stay at the Hyatt was a highlight of our trip. The hotel is centrally located on the Fisherman`s Wharf and close to sights and restaurants. The hotel is very modern and both the rooms and the lobby were renovated recently boutique-style.Would certainly go back to that hotel.
85,2101,"Oct 4 2008 	Excellent Contemporary Rooms in a Great Location for Visitors	This was our first visit to San Francisco. I looked at hotels in various locations in San Francisco. Fisherman's Wharf gets slammed as being a place that locals avoid. However, we were very glad that we chose Fisherman's Wharf as our base since it is so convenient to all types of transportation, is quiet at night and is less congested than other parts of San Francisco. The hotel is very clean and contemporary. Every Hyatt staff member that we encountered was pleasant and, if needed, helpful. The maid service was first-rate. I really liked the updated, contemporary furnishings in the rooms --- very clean with a large bathroom. We fell in love with their beds. The pillows and mattress are a piece of heaven after a long day. and the best of any hotel that I've stayed in, including The Ritz Carlton. Overall, we were not impressed with Knuckles, the Hyatt's sports bar &amp; restaurant. We ate there three times - twice for dinner and once for breakfast. The french fries were really great, but everything else was just okay or terrible. I'm a huge fan of Corn &amp; Crab Chowder, but I was underwhelmed with their take on the dish. The breakfast buffet doesn't have a large selection and is very overpriced. You're better off going to one of the cafes across the street."
86,2101,"Oct 3 2008	Great Hotel	We had a wonderful stay at Hyatt. We stayed in King Room on the fifth floor above the swimming pool. The hotel was very clean, and nice. I would stay there again!! All the employees were all freindly and helpful! Walking distance to the pier, cable car and plenty of restaraunts! we ate at both restraunts across the street, we felt they were good and plentiful! Knuckles had an excellent buffett and food as well, but a little more pricey, however I would say is average with most restraunts."
87,2101,"Sep 22 2008	Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf	Simply Perfect. My wife and I stayed 5 nights end August / start Sept. and had a great time. The service was top class throughout the hotel and the concierge knowledgeable and most helpful. The room we requested was exactly what we got, quiet and on the top floor. The bed was the most comfortable bed we have slept in, the room was a good size, and the bathroom was just fine. No bath, but we tend to shower anyway. Everywhere was spotlessly clean. We used the Sport bar on two occasions and found the food good but perhaps a little pricey, but no more so that any other hotel of this class. Only negative side was the cost to use the Internet. A service some hotel chains offer free.We took the advice from our fellow tripadvisors and avoided the Sport bar for breakfast, choosing to cross the street and eat at the Hollywood Cafe, best breakfast we had all holiday."
88,2101,"Sep 17 2008 	Very Nice Room in Good Location	Spent one free night there using Hyatt points. Check-in and check-out were fast and easy with self-serve kiosk. Clean, modern room was quite large. A comfortable king-size bed, a couple chairs, and a desk with a rather small flat-screen tv were the furnishings. There were plenty of lights, and the temperature controls worked fine. We were near the elevators, but never heard any noise in our room. The bathroom was a bit weird--It had a very shallow sink with low-pressure faucet built more for decoration than utility. Also, there seemed to be enough space for a tub but there was only a large shower. The shower head was a small square in the ceiling that swivelled a bit so you could adjust the aim slightly if you were tall enough. At 5'11&quot; I could reach it, but my wife (5'3&quot;) could not. The hotel is in a great location a couple blocks from the wharf, and convenient to two cable car lines, a streetcar, and several buses. It was a typical Hyatt, so no cheap meals or free breakfast. It's a good place for business travelers or couples; no so much for families."
89,2101,"Sep 9 2008 	Nice Hotel Great Location 	I would recommend the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf for anyone wanting to stay close to the Wharf area of San Francisco. It's centrally located to most activities. We needed parking for our rental car so we had the &quot;Wharf experience&quot; package that included parking and breakfast for two each day. You have your choice of odering off of the menu or the buffet. I would recommend the buffet. The breakfast was good, but I wouldn't have paid the menu price for it if it weren't in our package. Our rate was $225/night incl. parking and breakfast (parking is normally $39/day and breakfast buffet $18/person). Room was very clean and quiet. As mentioned by others, there wasn't a tub, but we are shower people anyway so it didn't matter."
90,2101,"Sep 9 2008 	Great for what we wanted	I was there with two sons, 14 and 6. Our 2 essential criteria for our SF hotel were a pool and a great location. The Hyatt has both. After 3 days in SF, I asked my 6 yr old what he liked best about SF. His immediate response, &quot;the hot tub.&quot; Having a pool is really a huge plus for my kids, otherwise I would have booked a nice B&amp;B. Our other 'must' was excellent location for sightseeing, not shopping. Hyatt hits a home run there, too. Right near Fisherman's Wharf and lots of public transportation. The location was superb.The hotel was very nice in all regards, although there was not a free breakfast. Usually we ate at the Hollywood Cafe across the street - not cheap but large portions so you could share, and the food was excellent and fresh. The Hyatt concierge was pretty helpful. We could have booked excursions through the hotel before we got there, but I think it was better that we did it separately (also, before we arrived - that was very helpful). I don't think the hotel's recommendations were that great. Use TripAdvisor to find the best things to do and the best tour operators.We ate in the hotel's restaurant, Knuckles, one night. Nothing to write home about. There's a new Thai restaurant (something Moon? Pearl?) just a block closer to Fisherman's Wharf, decor was like a cafeteria but the food was very good and relatively a bargain. SF ain't cheap! Two nights we ate at an Italian restaurant two blocks to the right as you exit the hotel, on the same side of the street. It was quite good, not cheap but won't kill you.The Holiday Inn Express across the street looked a bit cheesy compared to the Hyatt, but it's actually rated a bit higher, sounds like it has free breakfast and I think it has a pool, too. If you don't care about staying in a fancy-looking hotel, I'd book whichever one gives you the better rate. All in all, a generic but professional hotel with key attributes of location and a pool - definitely a pleasant stay."
91,2101,"Aug 27 2008 	A nice location for ""playing tourist"" Long Wknd	4nt stay Fri-Tue, booked thru travel agent and got a good rate. Smooth check-in, very nice welcome. Our room was on 2nd floor and overlooked an interior courtyard - so very quiet. The room was spacious and the beds were fantastic! Lots of pillows - high quality. The a/c was an older system and a bit loud coming on/off. Bathroom could use towel rails and fan and the new sinks really didn't have the best drainage. Loved the citrus-lavender toiletries. Also appreciated the single cup Starbucks coffee in-room. We didn't use the internet service. Reception people and porters were extremely pleasant and accommodating - always welcoming back from our day and asking if they could help us plan our morning. We consulted the concierge one evening and found this man a tad short and unaccommodating - not at all representative of the majority of staff. We ate at &quot;Knuckles&quot; one evening; average sports bar - nothing to write home about. The hotel was a great location for our wknd. It was far enough away from the main tourist route and smell of the wharf area. There is a great cafe across the street &quot;Hollywood Cafe&quot; for bkfst. Super Sightseeing is also on the corner - excellent. On the other side of the hotel, Cost Plus World Market, where one can buy cheap wine, cheese and take back to your room. We would stay here again for easy location, nice staff and wonderful beds!"
92,2101,"Aug 27 2008	Excellent Hotel in great location	This was the best hotel stay we've had in a while.The 2 dbl bed room was so quiet, clean and comfortable. It faced the courtyard so you couldn't hear any street traffic.The only negative was that it was down a very long hallway but it really didn't matter much.We were also on the same floor as the pool which we made use of on the day that it was warm enough.It was heated as well. I also did some laundry in the laundry room on the floor while we were swimming. Bring some quarters and powder detergent w/ you.The housekeeping was consistently excellent and even anticipated things like I noticed the tissue box was running low and I didn't even mention it and they brought a backup just in case we ran out. We never came home to a room that hadn't been cleaned yet.Tips: Walgreen's is nearby in case you forgot anything.If you rent a car from Avis 1.5 blocks away - they let you park in the garage for free so you don't have to pay the $40/ day at hotel.But San Francisco has great public transportation so just buy the multi day pass at airport and utilize it.Denny's is 1 block away for breakfast - the Hollywood cafe was just so-so and they charge 3.50 for an orange juice. Do try the Aquarium of the Bay at Pier 39 for a short tour - it's worth the entry fee.If it's raining the Exploratorium is wonderful for kids."
93,2101,"Aug 13 2008 	Nice Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for three days after spending the previous three days at the Tuscan Inn(also reviewed). This hotel has nice big rooms,large bathrooms and modern amenities.The front desk staff were very nice upon checkin and allowed us our room at 11:00am after checking out of the Tuscan Inn.The cleaning staff did a great job and were always friendly. Knuckle's sports Bar has a nice atmosphere but the food is overpriced with small portions.The Hotel is two blocks from the waterfront,the cable cars are one block behind and the #10 bus to AT&amp;T ballpark is one block down right beside the Tuscan Inn.The Hyatt is the next block down from the Best Western Tuscan Inn with the Hilton and Marriot just down the street and the Holiday Inn Express right across the street,so lots of hotel options in the area. The Hyatt room rates are a little more than some of the other hotels mentioned but I think it was worth the price as this was a very clean comfortable hotel."
94,2101,"Aug 10 2008 	Very nice stay.	We stayed four nights recently at the Fisherman's wharf Hyatt. Very nice room with large bathroom. Seemed quite clean. Pool wasn't large and was a bit crowded, but nice. Very good exercise/fitness facility. Great location. Several small breakfast places right across the street and within walking distance to cable car stop and street car/bus lines. Hotel staff very helpful with directions and help with public transportation. Would stay again."
95,2101,Aug 8 2008 	nice....	room was very nice but the internet was $10 a day then it didnt work??? they didnt charge us for it 'geez...thanks?...&quot; but then I had to use the &quot;business center&quot; in the lobby and they charge $6.95 for 15 minutes?? parking was a joke at $39 a night!! No mini bar just had 2 bottles of water that were $5 each?? first time I have ever had to pay for water!
96,2101,"Aug 5 2008 	great hotel strange shower great location	modern hotel with weird bathroom sink. we had no bathtub, only a shower which i thought was extremely strange. also the shower has no door - weird. the showerhead rains on you. because there is no door on the shower, you never get warm while you are taking a shower. if you have little kids, ask for a room with a tub. not sure if they have any. the location is a plus. two blocks from fisherman's wharf and right next to the area where the cable cars are. right across the street was a holiday inn express also. knockers restaurant good food, but hollywood cafe for lunch and breakfast is right across the street and more reasonable. august in san francisco is cold, cold, cold. you will need a jacket (warm), gloves, scarf, etc. don't show up with flip flops, tank tops and shorts because you will freeze your begeezers off! we left a very warm l.a. but made sure we took our coats out of our suitcases before we left the airport. once out of our taxi we were FREEZING!!! a lot of stores sold warm jackets for $19.99 that say &quot;san francisco&quot; on them. we saw a LOT of people in these jackets. luckily we've been to san fran many times and pack accordingly. (we're from southern california). we thought our room had a lot of street noise - after all, you're in the city. we turned on the fan on the air conditioner. the noise from that enabled us to sleep soundly. comfortable bed. we did the duck tour which was fun. make sure you get to pier 39. go to the end of it to see the hundreds of sea lions - absolutely adorable and it's completely free. had a great time and will return as usual."
97,2101,"Aug 5 2008 	Loved San Fran.	Booked room nine months before stay with an agent. Requested a two queen bed room and a rollaway bed for two parents and two teenage daughters. At check in, was given a king bed room, for four people!!!, because our agent didn't specify two queen beds, although the booking specified four people!! They said they were fully booked and this was the only room available.Apparently though, this worked to our advantage because the hotel has a two bed to a room policy. This meant that if we had a two queen bed room, we could not have had a rollaway bed, but a king bed room comes with a sleeper/ couch which isn't classified as a bed so we got a rollaway bed as well. We stayed in seven hotels in total during our vacation in California but this was by far the most comfortable.BUT..... the room we were given was a disabled room which meant that we didn't have a bath tub, but a walk-in shower room. The problem was that the shower head was set at a height of about 5' 5'' and my husband is 5' 11'' . Also the shower has an area of about 2' x 4' of a tiled floor sloping towards the drain separated from the rest of the bathroom by a curtain. The rest of the room slopes away fom the shower area, therefore any water which escapes the shower area floods the bathroom!!!!!! This happened every time we used the shower no matter how careful we were.The room had a view of part of the hotel roof and other rooms, but we weren't in there much so not a big deal.We can highly recommend the Hollywood Cafe opposite the Hotel entrance for breakfast."
98,2101,"Aug 4 2008 	Perfect location for a tourist	I just returned from a week long stay at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. First and foremost, it's a great location, but a bit on the steep side for the amenities. I chose not to spend the $10 a day usage for the internet. On the upside, it's literally two block sfrom the Wharf and a short walk from Ghiradelli Square to Pier 39, the main &quot;shopping/tourist&quot; spots. The cable car stop is behind the hotel. I was traveling with my elderly mother and my two sons and sharing a room was not an issue in terms of space. The rooms were comfortable, bedding was fluffy, but if you're looking for a firm bed, that's not what you will get. Surprisingly, there is no mini bar (or fridge) in the room, and there is no fan in the bathroom either The rate we got via AAA was better than the internet rates, plus AAA rate got us free buffet full breakfast each morning (eggs, fresh fruit, bacon/sausage, banana bread, etc), which is a huge savings. We chose the hotel for their outdoor hotel, but who knew that SF weather in late July would be so cool (it's like Maine weather so a bit cool for the pool when we stayed here). Downside is they only have one concierge on duty at a time, so the wait to get any information about tours or maps can take forever, and if the younger of the two is on duty, i wouldn't even bother asking him restaurant recommendations or suggested tours or routes. He wasn't very helpful and didn't seem to enjoy his role as concierge. The older gentleman was wonderful and extremely helpful and informative. The Radisson and Holiday Inn were close by as well, and are less expensive, if you don't want to spend the $270 a night at the Hyatt.TIP: Best place for dim sum is New Asia on Pacific Street in Chinatown, it's authentic and delicious. All the local Chinese eat there..(Yang Sink is the one the concierge and everyone seemed to recommend, but it's in a corporate office building, and it's really tailored to non-chinese tourists, and although a nicer setter and delcious food, is very expensive for dim sum). We had the same dishes at New Asia for less than half the price of Yang Sink...and it was better!"
99,2101,"Aug 4 2008 	Average hotel	We stayed at the Hyatt Fisherman's Warf during our San Francisco sightseeing trip. The location of the hotel was perfect, just around the corner of the warf. The hotel had an outstanding service when we arrived with our car and the check-in went more than smoothly. We needed some help with the booking for our Alcatraz tickets and we asked the concierge for some help. He took immediately care of it. Don't use the concierge service for dinner suggestions because they have really no idea! The rooms have a nice bathroom and they are clean! The size was perfect. We also visit there StayFit Fitness Center. It was a poor room without any daylight and a low ceiling. Breakfast buffet was simple but with a good quality. On our 3rd day 2 busses with teenagers arrived in the hotel. We couldn't believe that this was possible in such a hotel. On our last night they started (it was past midnight) to scream from window to window and running from room to room. I have called the reception and they received already a lot of complains. During check-out they apologized again and they deduct 1 night from the bill. Overall a nice hotel but we expect more for US$ 249.- ex taxes per night."
100,2101,"Aug 3 2008 	Great Location Nice Stay	Stayed here a Thrs - Mon late April - 2 adults and 8 month old baby in oversized guest room. Booked on Expedia and cost approx $AUS260 a night.Positives: Location was great, easy walk to Fishermans Wharf and to cable car. Room was little larger than normal hotel room so had baby in crib off to one corner of room. Price was ok for location and standard of hotel. Service was really good at check in, very friendly staff. Small fridge in room. Big Comfy Bed. Very Clean. Negatives: Internet very pricy to use. No bath - only shower. So had to shower the baby! View wasn't much - just of other rooms! Parking was really expensive so thankfully we had no car!We got them to get us a car to airport and that was arranged easily.Overall very happy with stay, would recommend it if good deal."
101,2101,Jul 28 2008 	Very nice.	Very nice hotel. Friendly. Clean. Very close to many tourist attractions. We could walk to most places we wanted to see.Breakfast buffet at Knuckles restaraunt was very good. Would stay here again.
102,2101,"Jul 28 2008 	busy busy	Stayed at the Hyatt for two nights in July, got a great deal directly with the Hotel with parking and breakfast inclusive.We arrived slightly early but were handled really well by the door/parking/bell boy staff and by reception, although we stood in line to check in and our room wasn't ready we did not have long to wait and we were given discount vouchers for drinks and food at the sports bar, a nice touch we thought.The room was fine, spacious and spotless, the only complaint we had was we felt the sports bar let down the Hotel, we thought it was dirty/gruby, stained seats and carpets and a little basic which is not in keeping with the rest of the Hotel, I have to say though that at peak breakfast time it was extremely busy, the staff coped very well and waiting time was minimal, food was only ok.The pool and gym we felt were very token features, quite small and compact.Finally I would advise anyone taking a car to book the parking inclusive rate as parking is a major issue in the city and the hotel parking staff were very good."
103,2101,"Jul 28 2008 	Great stay at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf	Our family of 3 spent 3 evenings at the Hyatt while visiting San Francisco for pleasure, during mid-July. We stayed in a 1 BR suite, which offered a separate bedroom and generously sized living room featuring a large plasma TV and pull-out couch. The hotel is decorated in minimalist, contemporary style (so be sure that this is to your liking), but is still comfortable. The housekeeping services were thorough and the room was always in tip-top condition after it was serviced mid-day. The location allows a quick 5 minute walk to the Fisherman's Wharf area, and about 10 mins to Pier 39. The historic Trolley is immediately behind the hotel, offering quick access to Nob Hill, Chinatown and other areas of the city. Our only complaints would be that the elevators are frequently crowded, causing long waits to go only 2-3 floors. Stairs are not accessible but would alleviate some of the waiting guests in the lobby area. As well, street noice is a problem if your room is at the front of the hotel. We got used to the noise from buses, motorcycles, etc after a while (which seemed to calm down after 10pm or so), but if you are sensitive to noise then make sure that you request a room at the back of the hotel or facing the interior courtyard pool."
104,2101,"Jul 26 2008 	Overpriced Overated Just OK	I travelled with my Wife and 6 month old daughter. We booked a King Room trhough Priceline and thougt we got an amazing deal. We arrived at the Hotel at around 11PM pm on a Thursday night. The check in took longer than ususal even though there was no one in front of me. The staff showed no sense of urgency even thought my baby was crying after a 12 hour journey to San Fran. When we finally did get the room, after an extremely long walk throught the crazy long hallway, we were impressed with the moderness of it. However, after inspecting it further, we hated it. The window was facing the bright lights of a 24 hour gas station and did not even have black out blinds to keep the light from coming in. Secondly, there was no bathtub and the sink was shallow - no bath for the baby? The shower did not have a covering so the water would splash out to the floor. Also, there was no shower head as the water come out from the ceiling right above your head - straight down. Since it was late, we decided to deal with it in the morning. MY wife went down the next morning. We were told that all King Room were the same - only shower. Our only choice was getting a double bed room since all the Suites were spoken for. After debating this over with the wife, we reluctantly agreed. The guy did give us breakfast vouchers for our entire stay but the breakfast sucked!!! We ate their twice in spririt of saving money. The place across the street, Hollywood Cafe had an excellent breakfast.The double room ended up being better for the family situation and we were pretty comfortable for the rest of the trip. Staff was firendly - great location if you like the wharf stuff which we hated. What's the big deal with San Fran anyways. The shopping was good but we found the food not so good. I don't know what the fuss is all aboat but I'll never go their at my expense again.Been there, Done that, will hopefully never do that again. I definately didn't leave my heart in San Fran."
105,2101,"Jul 20 2008 	Outstanding service!	Excellent location. Staff was wonderful--allowed me to leave my rental car there after I checked out so I wouldn't have to find parking elsewhere. When I checked in, the room they were going to give me had two beds--I asked for one with just a king bed. No problem. Location is great. Area seems safe for a big city. Hotel bar had good food, late. Very quiet. Room overlooked 3rd floor pool, but never heard any noise from there. The drapes completely blocked out any light, allowing me to sleep in. Reasonable price for a Hyatt in a big city with a good location."
106,2101,"Jul 16 2008 	Very nice hotel in a superb location	We stayed 6 nights in this hotel and found it to be a perfect place. The staff were friendly and very helpful (concierge gave us great directions, suggestions for things to do/see, and assisted us with a car rental). Because we were staying for a while, we were given a complementary bar fridge which was great to keep drinks and snacks fresh &amp; cold (there's a supermarket just a short walk away), so this was a great cost savings &amp; totally convenient for those late-night cravings. Moreover, because we reserved on the hotel site using our AAA membership, we were given a great rate, as well we were given complementary buffet breakfast for two every morning were were there (approx. value $18/day X 2 = $36/day) . Totally recommend this hotel to travellers wishing to be in the heart of the Fisherman's Wharf area!"
107,2101,"Jul 9 2008 	Great Hotel fab location	We stayed here for 5 nights in June, everything about the hotel is great, the location, staff and rooms etc. We had no problems with anything!!All I can say is please stay here and enjoy!!We booked via Expedia and got a good discount - the rates were much cheaper than booking with the hotel direct."
108,2101,"Jul 8 2008 	Loved the Hyatt!	Had a wonderful experience at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel was conveniently located and within walking distance to many things. The rooms were very modern and very clean. The beds were awesome, great quality sheets and lots of fluffy pillows. Pool and hot tub area were great for the teens we were traveling with. Hotel staff was helpful. The hotel restaurant was a little pricey, but very good. We had a free breakfast plan and the buffet was great. Our server &quot;Digna&quot; was the BEST! I would definitely stay at this hotel again!!"
109,2101,Jul 5 2008 	loved the hyatt	I stayed at the Hyatt Fishermans Wharf for four nights. It was an excellent hotel.The pool was on the third floor which was nice and private.Our room was fantastic and there was a really nice restaurant at the entrance.I will certainly be coming back.
110,2101,"Jun 13 2008 	Good hotel - if you're persisent	Arrived Thursday evening 29th May at about 4pm on a flight from Europe, so we were very jet lagged and quite tired - we requested a quiet room away from the hussle and bustle of the other guests and were told that would be no problem but the had no king sized beds available. We said ok but as we'd be staying several nights could we change the following day - we were told sure no problem.Got to the the room - it was next to elevator on the secound floor!! Immediatly I called down and got us another room on top floor in a quieter part of the building - why couldnt smiling Steve at the desk do that first instead of lying to us that it was a quiet room?!Next day we reuested a king size room and got one on a quieter level - all in all a good hotel IF you get over the staffs sparkling smiles and BS at checkin.Sports bar was better that expected and food was very good. Valet parking very expensive at $40 per night.A good spot for tourists that want to be close to Fishermans Wharf and is right beside the start for the tramline into the citys main shopping areas.Nice clean rooms and what has to be one of the BESTgym systems in a hotel I've used.One more thing, the queen sized beds are a joke - Im 6'3&quot; and not exactly small but even my wife at 5'6 struggled to get a decent nights sleep!"
111,2101,"May 28 2008 	Great Location !	This is a very clean modern Hotel. Walking distance to Fisherman's wharf and cable cars. The rooms are very nice, great shower &amp; beds. I would have to say the only thing that stinks is the $39 car park fee per day. Oh well that's a big city !"
112,2101,"May 28 2008 	Less art more function	I just got back from a two day stay at the Fisherman's Wharf Hyatt and while the hotel is in a great location and the staff was extreamly friendly there were issues with the rooms, mostly the bathroom. Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function. A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you. As for the shower it has a recessed shower head in the ceiling, I am 5 10&quot; and can adjust it my friend is 5 5&quot; and she had to get on her tip toes ,someone who is 5 3&quot; or shorter better bring there tooth brush into the shower and poke at it if they want to adjust it. It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide. This means you have to turn the water on standing under it for a nice blast of cold water until you can dive out of the way or until it's warm enough to get back under. Some other things might help this hotel get the 4 or 5 rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel. Not only is it a eye sore it's very loud when items are thrown into it. There are a lot of places on that street that are not occupied 24/7 and how about a mini bar?? I know when I booked the room it didn't have one and it didn't bother me from my computor... It did bother me when I wanted a drink when I got to my room.Overall the rooms were very clean, the staff very nice and the location is great, some small changes and the hotel would be great also. Until then it's just a little above average."
113,2101,"May 28 2008 	Good Hotel Nice Location	Our family of four stayed at this hotel over Memorial Day weekend. Overall we enjoyed our visit. The hotel was well located - very close to the cable car line and within a few blocks of Fishermans Wharf. Be bought 3 day Muni passes which gave us unlimited use of the cable cars, street cars, and city buses. For $18 each, we thought that was a bargain.The rooms were large enough, clean, and appeared to be newly remodeled. The kids loved the big screen TV and I-Home. However, they were disappointed that they did not have a DVD player in the room (or even any to loan out for use). After a long day of touring San Francisco, it would have been nice to relax with a movie that everyone could see (we brought some movies but had to watch them on the laptop). The beds were nice and comfortable. Even though there were big parties going on at the hotel, our room was quiet. We also were able to use the pool and hot tub one day, which is a treat for an urban location.The service at the hotel was friendly. The concierge was helpful with directions, but not so useful when it came to things like restaurant recommendations. When we asked her for breakfast options, she really pushed the hotel restaurant. However, after walking around, we found plenty of choices nearby.We crammed as much as touring as possible into our long weekend  the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Chinatown, Hait Street, Lombard, the farmers market at the Ferry Building, Nob Hill, Union Square, and of course Fishermans Wharf. Here is a list of some of the family friendly restaurants we enjoyed.Hollywood Caf  across from hotel  very good, reasonable breakfast but cash onlyPats Caf  behind the hotel  delicious breakfastMcCormick &amp; Kuletos in Ghirardelli square  excellent happy hour with full entreesFour Seas  Chinatown  Dim SumCalzones  Little Italy  yummy calzones &amp; MojitosFrytes  French fries with all sorts of dipping sauces make a great snackBurgermeister  one of the better cheese steaks weve hadGhirardelli soda fountain for ice cream, of course.As with other Hyatt properties, the biggest complaint is the absence of the little things, such as coffee in the lobby and free internet. With a few extras that probably dont cost much, Hyatt could turn a good stay into an excellent one."
114,2101,"May 16 2008 	Excellent location !! Loved it	My Daughter and I stayed here on a recent trip and it was exceptional. Friendly staff, bartenders (Thanks Clayton), and clean, clean rooms.The hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to most attractions. The public transportation is easy and near by.For breakfast, check out the Hollywood Cafe across the street. Excellent service. We ate there everyday.You can't go wrong with this hotel."
115,2101,"May 13 2008 	Wonderful Experience	I recently returned from a stay at the Hyatt in Fisherman's Wharf. I work in the Hotel/Resort industry and have a very particular eye when staying at other hotels, and the Hyatt was wonderful! The staff were helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The Concierge booked our trip to Alcatraz very quickly, with no hassle at all. Our bartender, Clayton, fixed us the most delicious (and strong) Mai Tai's all night one night during our stay. He also told us about a wonderful restaurant called Sardini's on Columbus Ave. It was the best Italian food I've had in years! The rooms were modern and decorated very nicely. Loved the bedding, and the shampoo/conditioner/soap in the room (Lavender citrus). My one and only complaint is that the hot tub closes at 9pm. We got home from dinner and wanted to take a dip because San Fran can get very chilly, but it was already closed. The courtyard where the hot tub is located is surrounded by hotel rooms so they probably can't keep it open late because they don't want to disturb these guests, understandably. We had a wonderful Mother/Daughter vacation at the Hyatt, and please tell Clayton we said THANKS for the Mai Tai's and for telling us about Sardini's!"
116,2101,"May 12 2008 	Romantic Weekend	I can't say enough good about this hotel. The location was perfect you could walk to so many attractions, restaurants, bars, shops, etc... The staff was amazing! The room was spectacular (King Suite). I loved this place!!The bed was extremely comfortable as was the rest of the room. And all the windows - it was so beautiful!I would recommend it to any and everyone!!"
117,2101,"May 8 2008	Good value great location and brill rooms	We booked a great rate of 209 per night for a Deluxe Room, including breakfast for 2 and valet parking. Check in was fast and efficient, although we were given the wrong room type initially. I suspect the rate we booked might have been a mistake as it soon disappeared online, and that the hotel were trying to get away with giving us a standard room because of this. Anyway, this was no problem and we were swiftly moved to a Deluxe (Corner) room.The room is lovely and large, with huge windows on two sides overlooking Coit Tower in one direction and towards Nob Hill in the other. The room was decorated in soothing grey/blues and neutral tones, and was truly a relaxing and pleasant place to be and wake up every morning. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was equipped with a soft seating area in one corner, a table with four chairs and a huge desk area - nothing had been overlooked. The entrance lobby was large enough to accommodate an extra bed for our 4 year old which worked great as it felt like she had an area separate to ours. The table and chairs was a fantastic bonus, as we were able to comfortably enjoy take-outs when getting over jetlag and not feeling like eating out. The bathrrom was large with a floor to ceiling window (which let in lots of light but it was rather disconcerting to sit on the loo overlooking the buildings opposite!!). Unfortunately our room did not have a bath, just a large walk in shower. We did not notice this until after the bell boy had left us, and did not have the heart to complain again, due in no small part to the room being so fantastic in every other way. The breakfast included was good with plenty of choice of cereal and dried fruits, yoghurts, toast, muffins etc and a small selection of cooked items. We had to pay extra for our small daughter but this amounted to probably $12 a day including tip, so we didn't mind too much as we were getting a good deal overall. We didn't eat in the restaurant/sports bar, but it looked busy and buzzing when we passed. The pool area is nice, although in April the heated pool was not heated enough to compensate for the rather chilly air, but no matter.Overall this was one of my favourite hotels during our trip to the US. We were once loyal Fairmont guests, but decide to forego the opportunity to stay there on this trip to San Francisco. At no point during our stay did I ever regret this. The Hyatt is well placed for touristy things that kids like at the Wharf and is convenient for transport links elsewhere. I would definitely return here."
118,2101,"May 6 2008	Fantastic!	We stayed here for 3 nights at the start of our holiday. Very impressed with the service from start to finish. Staff were all very friendly and incredibly helpful. We had an executive king room. The room was beautiful, very luxurious and huge! Bathroom was gorgeous, although I could have done with a door or some way to completely close in the shower because it got a bit chilly! That said I couldn't fault anything, there was everything we could need and more. I was very impressed to find laundry facilities for guest use, which may not be useful to everyone, but for people like us travelling to a few different places and travelling light it was helpful to say the least. On our last day we hired a car for the next leg of our trip and needed to go back to the hotel with the car to collect our belongings. The valet let us leave the car at the front entrance, free of charge, until we had brought the stuff down. This was great, and to me showed me what I was paying the extra money for. Location was fab, we were within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf, both Cable Car turnarounds, Lombard St and a short ride to downtown. All in all, FAB FAB FAB! I would definitely recommend it. My only other gripe would be breakfast. It wasn't included in our rate, but there were plenty of places to eat near the hotel so it wasn't too big an issue!"
119,2101,"Apr 29 2008 	Great hotel in great location!	Me and my boyfriend literally just got back from our trip to SF and we stayed at the Hyatt. We booked through Hotwire and lucked out, got a great price and the hotel was amazing. Modern decor, very clean, the bed was so comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again. 2 blocks from Fishermans wharf and not too far from everything else."
120,2101,"Apr 20 2008 	Lovely hotel in a great location	We stayed in the Hyatt for 3 nights at the start of a 2 wk tour of California. We arrived in the afternoon after a very long flight and were pleasantly surprised at the hotel.It looks like it has recently been renovated so both rooms were fresh and clean. The bathroom was huge with lots of space for moving around. We always found the staff to be extremely friendly and they were always willing to help with any of our questions.We ate in Knuckles for breakfast twice and had dinner there once it was expensive but really convenient, particularly for breakfast in the morning.The hotel was in a great location and I'm glad that we picked Fishermans Wharf as we did consider Union Square. I found the Union Square area pretty grotty and there were lots of homeless people bothering the tourists for money/food. In Fishermans Wharf we were able to walk around freely without being hassled once and this included at night. Fishermans Wharf is a lovely area to stay in and I would definitely recommend the Hyatt."
121,2101,"Apr 18 2008 	Avoid The Sports Bar !	We stayed in an oversized corner room which was great. Lots of space, nice large bathroom, comfortable. Only downside to room was the noise of the raod and a little cold wind through the windows.The hotel was clean and the lobby was nice, reception staff all helpful.The downside: the conceirge was less than helpful when we tried ot arrange a ball game -she tried to get us tickets via an agent and gave us misleading information about the game being booked out and only realy expensive tickets available through an agent. Luckily we ignored her advise and went to the game to buy tickets at the gate for a 1/4 of the cost she qouted..hmmm makes you wonder.The knucles bar was dire..breakfast was ok, although service not that great. In the evening it was like something out of one flew over the cuckoos nest.. young under age looking locals, a huge mess everywhere of monkey nut shells and empties..no where comfy to sit for a relaxing drink and chat..not what you would expect from a 4 * hotel, in fact this really let the whole place down- if you are from the uk..think travel inn with pub attached ! Shame as the rooms were nice, gym was good and pool was great !"
122,2101,"Apr 15 2008	Great Hotel but thin walls	Stayed at HFW for a conference late last month. Overall this is a great hotel and I highly recommend it. The property was immaculate, well designed and very well maintained and service was excellent. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly. The close proximity of the hotel to the Fisherman's Wharf also makes the hotel's location very appealing (but, in fairness, there are lots of other hotels in that area also). My only crticism of the hotel is that the walls between guest rooms are very thin. I could clearly hear the conversation of the two women in the room adjacent to mine. Next to cleanliness and scent (i.e. no smoke odors, which unfortunately I often encounter even in non-smoking rooms) my second biggest peeve are paper thin walls; which unfortunately this hotel has. Otherwise though, a very nice hotel."
123,2101,"Apr 9 2008 	Perfect for disabled ppl	Located only about 5 minutes from fisherman's wharf (sealions) and another 5-10 minutes from the cable car that takes you into the heart of the city.the hotel itself seems a bit old (ventilation was very noisy in the room and not built-in) but the staff is very helpful and the rooms are great. we were 3 ppl (me, my dad and my sister who's in a wheelchair) and they gave us a room with a king-size bed and an extra bed for the third person to stay on. when it comes to the bathroom, i have to say that it was just perfect! really spacy so the wheelchair could move around without problems and the shower perfectly adapted to ppl who have to sit while showering.only disadvantage: in the back of the hotel, there's a carpet floor which makes it hard for the person in the wheelchair to move without assistance.the service was great, the staff was superfriendly and helpful and when i'm going there this september, i'm staying at this hotel again. already booked the room..."
124,2101,"Apr 6 2008 	Good hotel 	We stayed here for 5 nights, we are a family with two young children and asked for a room with two large beds which we got, the room was very nice, the breakfast was ok but very expensive so each day we ate breakfast at Holywood cafe straight across the road which was the best breakfast we have ever had anywhere and at half the price of the hotel, its very popular so expect to wait for a table as its only small but its worth the wait!The hotel is well run, clean and in an great location to walk to all atractions, even with a 4 &amp; 6 year old, the cable cars are a must, pier 39 good and entertaining, avoid China town which is run down and we could not find a good restaurant, sure there are some but after 1 hour walking we just went into the biggest which was less then average and we had to wait 30 mins for a table.If you get chance go to the Jelly belly factory tour about 45 mins drive away, its free and you also get free samples!Take a boat ride across the bay, we ate at a restaurant called yankee pier 1 night which was very nice.All in all a very nice stay &amp; would stay again at this hotelAAA ++++"
125,2101,"Mar 19 2008 	Great Place to Stay!	Stayed here for one night last week...it's a great hotel in a great location. Only two blocks from fisherman's wharf...easy walking distance to major piers, ghiradelli Square, and the cable car stop is directly behind the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, rooms were very nice...recently renovated with flat screen tv, great bed, luxurious bathroom and jacuzzi tub in our room. Booked a package price on Hyatt.com web site that included one night parking ($39) and breakfast buffet for two in attached sports bar that was wonderful ($35).... Had great clam chowder on fisherman's wharf....the best happy hour deal ever at McCormick and Kobeto's about six blocks away from 3-6pm M-F. Had 3 appetizers and two drinks for less than twenty bucks and the food was great!  We'll be staying at this hotel again!"
126,2101,"Mar 16 2008 	Don't stay here if you don't light compact fluorescent lights!	I arrived late that evening and was upgraded to the presidential suite because there were no other rooms. I was particularly excited because the hotel had recently been renovated and the lobby was gorgeous. It was a very nice blend of traditional and contemporary decor in light cream/beige tones. The presidential suite had also been renovated, but was done so in very dark, masculine colors (burgundy, black, and greys). It was definitely a guy's hangout, not a place that most women would want to be. To be fair, it was well appointed, with a sitting area, powder room, a lounge area (all ready for a poker game) with a very large screen TV, separate bedroom with another Samsung flatscreen, a dressing area, and bathroom with whirlpool. The hair products were excellent. Room service breakfast came quickly and was very good, although the allegedly &quot;fresh-squeezed&quot; juice was not. Excellent service all around. My chief complaint? Every light had compact fluorescent bulbs in them. I know they are environmentally friendly, but the light they give off is absolutely depressing, particularly with a cold and stark modern decor. It just did not make for a very warm, pleasant environment. . I may start bringing my own lighbulbs (just a few) on trips from now on. . . ."
127,2101,"Mar 13 2008	Newly Renovated and Well Run	We were there for a conference. It appeared newly renovated. Everything was in excellent condition. Our room was large, nicely decorated, and in tip top shape. Almost everyone was very nice and non-pushy. The valets outside were helpful with directions and information. Check-in was pleasant. Our only minor objection was a concierge who was not helpful and acted as if she was getting paid to push a particular restaurant. We didn't eat at their restaurants so we can't comment on that. In summary, we would stay again."
128,2101,Mar 13 2008	Loved the Hyatt at the Wharf	We loved this hotel. Staff was extremely pleasant and accomodating. The restaurant/bar was exceptional. The location was great. My only objection is the price of parking. I felt $40 per day plus tax is gouging but maybe that's just the way it is in San Francisco downtown.
129,2101,"Mar 2 2008 	Just OK for us	this is a nice big hotel (very Hyatt) in a good location very close to Fisherman's wharf. Buffet breakfast was good and staff was helpful (although they now have these automatic self check inn/out kiosks and you barely speak to anybody). Still there are plenty of cheaper hotel around that offer a great service as well, so, if you're not planning to stay at your room for too long i wouldn't recommend this hotel, in my opinion its pretty overpriced and they charge extra for everything (internet, water, etc.). Smaller and cheaper hotel give the same for free and cost a third of Hyatt's price, its not about being cheap, cause i do think that service and comfort must be paid for, it just that i don't feel this hotel is so much better than the other ones to justify its price."
130,2101,"Feb 25 2008	Nice Stay	We recently spent 6 nights at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. As several reviewers have pointed out, the hotel has undergone a renovation. We found the rooms to be clean, decent in size, and the beds very comfortable. We requested a refrigerator and a rollaway which they were happy to supply at no cost. A wireless connection is $9.98 per day. The staff was very friendly. A nice bonus was the washer/dryer on the floor. The Hyatt has a nice sports bar called Knuckles which has a pool table and shuffle board. The menu has burgers, sandwiches, salads, as well as some nicer main course entrees. The prices are not cheap, but on par with a typical hotel restaurant.There are several hotels in the Wharf area from nearly every low to mid-tier chain. If you want to stay close to the Pier and Alcatraz (especially with young children) and get decent value, this area is for you and the Hyatt will acheive your objective. If you want to get a real feel for San Francisco, I'd probably stay in the Union Square area or maybe Nob Hill."
131,2101,"Feb 9 2008 	Enjoyed the stay	The second time we have stayed here this time of year. The lobby has been remodeled this past year. The location is great with the wharf a couple blocks away. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. If your looking for lodging in this neighborhood, consider this location."
132,2101,"Feb 7 2008 	Nice Hotel	I recently stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel has recently been renovated and the room are very nice. Blues and browns with modern wood furniture. The bed was comfortable. The lobby was nice, but unimpressive. The hotel also has an outdoor pool and hot tub, but I did not get to use the facilities as it was too cold.The hotel's location is in the center of Fisherman's Wharf and convenient to the cable cars and other transportation to the business district of San Francisco. There is a supermarket and a drug store a block away from the hotel.The staff at the hotel was very nice. The front desk staff was very pleasant and welcoming. The bellmen were helpful, arranging transportation for me to a business meeting outside of the city. The hotel has a sports bar/restaurant - Knuckles. It is said to be a historical location. The food was good (although not great_ and the service was very good. Generally, its burgers, sandwiches, and the like, although there are some higher-end offerings.All in all, if you are looking for a nice hotel in the Wharf area of San Francisco, I would recommend this hotel. It is much nicer than other hotels that I have stayed at in the Wharf area. The only caveat I will mention is that the Wharf is very touristy and reminds me of being at the Jersey Shore (which I quite enjoy also). If you are looking for a more upscale area, stay in Nob Hill."
133,2101,Jan 7 2008 	too expensive to eat	After travelling around the west coast of United States as a group of eight i would have to say i was very disappointed with the food that was attached to the hyatt hotel. Room service was the most expensive we had experienced throughout America. We had 3 burgers and three cokes and the room service bill was over US$80.00 .If anyone is staying there i recommend the little cafes across the street(food was quite good). Hotel was fine but a long walk to the elevators from your room and a bit of a rabbit warren.xx AUSSIE TRAVELLERS.
134,2101,"Jan 3 2008 	Great Hotel Good Price!	We went to this hotel for a couple days after Christmas for a little family getaway. As background, my husband and I are 30 and we traveled with our 1 year old daughter. This hotel was great - for kids or for people traveling without. The rooms looked newly remodeled and were very sleek, modern, and clean. They were as spacious as you can get - we didn't feel too cramped, even with a crib and all the gear that goes along with traveling with a baby. Great location - about 2 blocks from the main part of the Wharf. We liked that because it was easy to get to everything, yet far enough away it was quiet. There is a great breakfast place right across the street called 'Hollywood Cafe' - we had our best breakfast there of the trip - and you never would guess it just by looking at it."
135,2101,"Dec 30 2007 	Too many issues	We stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf for 2 days and 2 nights. We rented a 2-bedroom suite and the accomodations were nice. Assuming the service at the hotel had been average, this would likely be a 4-star review.However, service was poor.1) Called front desk three times over a 1 hour period for a key to one of the bedrooms. No luck, I finally had to walk down and get it myself.2) Hot breakfast served cold (I mean not remotely warm, truly cold).3) Wireless internet is $9.95/day and it cuts out about once every 20 minutes.4) Our bags were stored when we checked in as our room was not ready. When it came time to pick up our bags, the staff could not find one of them in the storage room. They looked for a few minutes and said it was not there. I asked if I could help. I went in and found it in about 5 seconds.There are four or five other things I could list but I think I've made my point. Just too many missteps for a stay that was less than 48 hours long.The location (near the wharf) is ideal and, for the most part, the staff is friendly and tries to be helpful. The rates are reasonable as well.This hotel has the potential to be a good hotel however they need to make numerous changes before I recommend anyone stay there."
136,2101,Dec 7 2007 	Great hotel and Good location	Enjoyed my stay at the Hyatt @ Fisherman Wharf! I was worried because of reviews in the past but overall it was great. After doing allot of walking its nice to come back to a very comfortable bed! Very friendly staff. Hotel will accommodate you with a mini fridge if needed. location is great. Trolleys are right behind the hotel and will take you straight to shopping District. There are convenient places near the hotel like Denny's - Starbucks- CVS Store-. I will definitely be back because of its location!
137,2101,"Dec 4 2007 	Nice Hotel but.....	Stayed here for 2 nights. Overall I would say that this a nice hotel. Not elaborate, and certainly not a dump. Definitely was clean, the room was near spotless. The issues that I had may not be an issue to everyone, but there is no restaurant that offers breakfast. You either have to order room service (at no bargain) or leave the hotel to go have a sit down breakfast (which we did by going down the street to the Best Western-Tuscan INN..very nice too). There is a sportsbar type restaurant on site, but we did not eat there so I can not comment on it. The other issue I had was the $39 valet parking. I can understand the need to charge for over night parking, and see that a lot of hotels are going to this. However $39 to park a car is boarder line taking advantage. Yes, it's nice to pull up to within a couple of feet of the front door and have your car parked, but the lack of parking in the area leaves you no choice but to pay the piper. However, with that said, if I was to stay in this area again I would stay at the Hyatt and bite my tongue about the fee, and continue to walk down the street for breakfast. I'll take the cleanliness and comfort and deal with these minor issues."
138,2101,"Dec 4 2007 	Great hotel - excellent location	This hotel is in a prime location - a few blocks from Ghirardelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf. The beds are SO comfortable! If you prefer a quiet room (like we did), ask for a room facing the courtyard. This hotel is also one block down from the street car, trolley lines and bus lines. You can purchase an all-day pass for $11 to ride these unlimited - note: this is not valid for BART. Two blocks down there is a Walgreen's - great place to stock up on bottled water (since the hotel wants $5 per bottle) or juice and light snacks. The vending machines are far with the long, maze-like halls and hard to get to on all floors - they are in a locked room and lacking in choices. Parking is expensive - $39 per day valet. There's a parking garage two blocks up on Beach Street (imparking) for $20 per day with no in/out privileges. If you use the offsite parking, be sure not to leave anything in your car. There's also a bread factory you can tour about three blocks away called Boudin. They have a full restaurant and an eatery. We were so cold after walking the Pier and stopped in for a bread bowl with soup - what a treat! Highly recommend!"
139,2101,"Nov 30 2007 	Modern Renovation	Wanted to stay near the Fisherman's Wharf area and found the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. Read that it had been recently renovated and chose to stay here. Was pleasantly surprised with the Lobby and Valet reception. Very friendly and quick check-in. Thought the decor was very nice and modern. Did not receive reserved room, but was happy with my stay. My wife and I enjoyed our stay."
140,2101,"Nov 28 2007 	Nice Hotel	Stayed for six nights over Thanksgiving.Room &amp; bath were large &amp; pleasant. Staff was great, helpful &amp; friendly. Cable car was located right outside hotel (Buy a Muni pass-we got 7-day for $24.00 which covered cable cars, street cars, buses and Muni subways-not BART). A cable car ride alone is $5.00. All is not perfect. The layout is a little like a maze though you will eventually learn the way to your room. The elevators are a little ridiculous, the stairs would be much quicker and easier but they open outside &amp; alarm. The restaurant is overpriced but all hotel restaurants are. There are so many good ones in San Francisco that we really didn't care. Fishermans Warf is really an uninteresting tourist trap but the MUNI system gave us easy access to the entire city."
141,2101,"Nov 23 2007 	excellent stay at the Hyatt	the hotel was very clean, newly renovated, well- furnished and quiet. The great location was convenient to the Wharf, Ghiardelli square and the marina with multiple places to access city transportation making a car optional. in addition, the staff was friendly. the onsite workout facility was excellent. in general, we were quite pleased with our stay. initially, it was tough to choose a hotel in such a large city that would be right for a family of five. this hotel was great."
142,2101,"Nov 20 2007	Very happy	Almost didnt stay here because of the inconsistent reports on the hotel, but was glad we did. Contrary to some travellers we really liked the upgrade done on the hotel and found it to be modern, fresh, light and very attractive. Its also in a great location if you particularly want to stay at Fishermans Wharf, with the cable car right by behind the hotel. Stayed in a Deluxe Room which we would recommend because of the extra space, the fact its on the top floor and therefore quiet, plus the reasonably good views from the room. There is no doubt that its a little expensive and the parking fees are a rip off, but everywhere of similar quality had similar costs. So we were really very happy with our selection, very comfortable tstaying here and would definately stay again."
143,2101,"Nov 17 2007 	Highly Recommended	Stayed 4 nights at this hotel. Location perfect walking distance for Fishermans Wharf but far enough away for quiet nights. Large, clean, spacious room overlooking the pool. Staff very frendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast included in hotel room deal, very good variety. Would definately pick this hotel again."
144,2101,"Nov 13 2007 	Nice but has a few issues	First problem: We didn't get the room I'd reserved, even though I'd booked it 2 months in advance and we checked in around 5:00. I tried to use Hyatt's Gold Passport early check-in several times during the day of arrival, but was unable to secure a room. Instead of a larger, deluxe corner room we were given a very tiny standard room. At least they didn't charge us the original price!Second problem: The noise! Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking a busy street and the traffic, car alarms, loud talking and yelling after the bar closed and delivery and garbage trucks in the early morning kept us awake for most of the night, every night. If you can, request one of those no-view courtyard rooms.Third problem: The bathroom. Beautifully designed, no doubt, but not very functional. The sink is so shallow that you can't wash your face without splashing all over the counter top. The shower head, which is mounted in the ceiling, was impossible to turn on without drenching half of your body in ice cold water. There's no tub and I'd have enjoyed a good soak after being out in the rain all day. Speaking of water, one morning the hotel seemed to have run out of hot water. Also, the lighting was very dim and there was no make-up mirror.The good things: An extremely comfortable bed, a great location, friendly and helpful valet guys and a big TV. It was newly renovated, very clean and the maid service was great. The walls seem thick -- we never heard anybody on either side of us, or in the corridor. A good friend has just moved to San Francisco and hopefully we will visit often, but I think I'll try another hotel."
145,2101,"Nov 12 2007 	Very nice hotel but a few hints to make it better	This was my second stay at the Hyatt and overall I was very pleased with everything. The service and friendliness of the staff was outstanding. As others have noted, the location is excellent with easy access to Fishermans Wharf. A couple of hints to make a stay even better: Many of the hotel rooms face small inner court areas with absolutely no views. The rooms are just fine, but if you want to enjoy views of the San Francisco hills try to get a room that overlooks the city. The hotel features Knuckle's sports bar, which has good food and a bunch of screens to view sports. However, don't even try to get into the place during major sporting events as the place fills up with avid sports fans. Otherwise, a very nice spot for a beer and OK food."
146,2101,"Nov 7 2007 	Great Stay	My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for 3 nights. The hotel is nice, and the location is perfect. It&quot;s close enough to walk down to Fisherman's Wharf in about 5 minutes. It is a few blocks away from the crowds, which is nice because the hotel is quiet at night.We booked the aquarium package, which included the breakfast buffet each morning, and tickets to the aquarium at the wharf. I though the breakfast was very good, with lots of variety. My only complaint was the bathroom. It was large, but did not have a tub, shower only. The shower was just like the showers we have seen in Europe, the enclosure only covers the shower area to the midpoint, so water splashed out all over the floor. The large flat screen TV was a plus, and the King bed was very comfy. Overall I can't complain, and would stay here again."
147,2101,Oct 31 2007 	Very Nice Hotel	Recently my wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights. The hotel was very nice with exzcellent service . The hotel staff could not do enough for you. The sports bar has decent food and is a great place to watch a sporting event.
148,2101,"Oct 30 2007 	Great Stay outstanding Concierge	I knew my stay would be a good one from the beginning. I called the Concierge desperately looking for a restaurant I had been to many years ago and she said it had closed, I wanted to find the Chef there and no one had track of him for a while. I left my phone number and she called me 20 min later and told me where he was. I have been trying to research for several months and got no answers. This lady has pull! She got us into the most difficult restaurants in the city (Gary Danko in a SNAP!). She definetly went above and beyond for us and we thought it is worth mentioning. The rooms are great, modern, comfortable. The plasma TV was great too! The hotel was very quiet and pleasant as well.Our overall feeling of this place was really good, friendly staff and they all seemed really happy there. We will definetly ome back to the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf in 2008."
149,2101,Oct 25 2007 	Not Impressed	Stayed here for a business conference in October. Location is great and a great base for the San Fran sightseer. We found expensive rooms lacking of amenities like microwave and refridgerator. Safe did not work and did not latch. Staff was friendly but would recommend staying across the street at the Holiday Inn Express for a much better value and room.
150,2101,"Oct 19 2007	Nice stay	Stayed at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf for 2 nights in January 2007. The room was newly remodeled and bed was extremely comfortable. Flat screen TV in the room was a nice touch. This hotel can be a little pricey but is in a good location close to Fisherman's Wharf. I booked with the AAA rate so it wasn't too expensive for a weekend. The shower was a little weird since the water came down from the ceiling and there wasn't much water pressure. I was a little disappointed that the fitness center was in the process of being remodeled so I was not able to take advantage of the facilities. Overall, it was a nice stay and would definitely consider staying there again on my next trip to San Francisco."
151,2101,"Oct 15 2007 	Perfect Hotel	I have no complaints. The rooms were very clean. Nice decor, comfortable beds. Fun sports bar/restaurant. We had a package which included parking and breakfast. The breakfast buffet was excellent. The location was the best. Close to both of the cable car stops, Pier 39, You can ride on any and all public transportation all day when you purchase their pass (approx. $11.00 per day). Cheaper then cabs and alot of fun. Alcatraz by Night was a great tour. Coit Tower, great views. Bring comfortable shoes. Loved San Francisco and our stay at the Hyatt."
152,2101,"Oct 15 2007 	EXCELLENT ACCOMODATION SERVICE AND LOCATION	After a very attentive and long survey, we have chosen this Hotel because it has been recently renovated in 2006, and the price was acceptable for the standard offered. We stayed 4 nights in the first days of October 2007 in this Hotel. At ounce we were gratified by a nice welcome : 2 different rooms were proposed to be visited at 11.30 a.m. (far before the regular check-in time),and we finally turned the key of a quiet courtyard overlooking room, very large and comfortable, nicely modern fashion-type decorated. Everything was perfect, including a very comfortable bed with silky sheets, and a large and very convenient bath room. We enjoyed the generous and tasty well-served breakfast. But the four star issue is definitevely the Hyatt's Customer Service : all the staff is very professionnal, efficient and always smiling when taking into account your slightiest desires.A special mention is to be dedicated to the Concierge, who gave us a great choice of personalized information service which was highly relevant in enriching all our stay in San Francisco (concerning public transport, restaurants, places of interest, kind of different shopping areas, local uses, etc...). This young Lady Concierge was even able to persevere in brilliantly solving a complex problem of furniture-bought shipping to Europe. Last but not the least, the hotel location is perfect : in a quiet area, but very close to cable cars lines, street cars terminal, bus stops, and rental car agencies. A great thank you to all Hyatt staff : you were a major issue when enjoying our fascinating stay in SF ! Next year we shall return, but no need for a boring survey: we know perfectly where to go (and return)!"
153,2101,"Oct 5 2007 	Disappointing	This was our 2nd hotel in San Francisco and once again - disappointing (especially as all the other accomodation on our Californian/Nevada trip was far better and cheaper). I requested a pool view or courtyard room on a lower floor as I do not use elevators. I clearly stated this in my request. We got a room overlooking a roof on the 4th floor and I was told at first that I could not use the stairs as they were for staff only. Eventually, they agreed to let me use the stairs but only if I was accompanied by a member of staff - another tip - no way! The location was good but there were other hotels in the same area which were cheaper. I chose the Hyatt via TA and based on its reputation but think I would stay elsewhere next time and save some money."
154,2101,"Sep 29 2007 	Superb Hyatt	My family and I (wife and two teenage children) stayed at the Hyatt in early August 2007. Front desk, accommodation, room service, cleaning, were all top class. 'Knuckles' is a superb sports bar/restaurant where service is good and the reasonably priced food is terrific. The multiplicity of screens show sports as diverse as Gaelic Football, Soccer, Basketball, American Football and Baseball.The hotel is located within 10 minutes' walking distance of the Wharf's Pier 39 in a very secure area.The Hyatt is a superbly run hotel and we would highly recommend it as the perfect base for a trip to beautiful San Francisco."
155,2101,"Sep 28 2007 	Very nice hotel GREAT location	Enjoyable stay in SF. Hyatt was lovely and the location can't be beat. Very close to the Pier 39 and Ghiradelli, convenient to public transportation (there is a cable car turn around behind the hotel!) The room was comfortable and clean. Very nice beds with lots of pillows, greatly appreciated after a long day walking. We had a room on the inside so our view was only of the roof, but at least it was quiet that way. A few complaints though (unfortunately). 1. There were only fluorescent lights in the room. Hate hate hate, fluorescent lights. While I'm all for going green and conserving energy, would it really be too much of an imposition to put an incandescent somewhere in the room?!? 2. Knuckles, the hotel restaraunt/sports bar. Food, good. Service so-so. Price, way too much. Both times we ate there we waited quite a while to be served. And I realize that in a hotel restaraunt you pay for convenience but what I paid for breakfast was outrageous (over $50 for 2 people). I paid as much for my one glass of milk as I could have bought 2 gallons worth had I gone down to the Safeway a few blocks away. Overpriced as it was though, if you're willing to pay the price I'd highly recommend their sticky-bun french toast."
156,2101,"Sep 16 2007 	Clean and Convenient	The service was slightly less than what I expected from Hyatt but the room was a comfortable size, quiet, and clean. We had reserved an oversized room, but upon checking in they only had one over-sized King room available and it's wall of windows looked right out at the whirlpool/spa of the courtyard. Not only could you see all the pool activity from the comfort of your own bed, but you could hear the pump and those enjoying the tub. We decided to down-grade to a standard sized King room on the fifth floor overlooking the courtyard and found it to be adequately sized and very quiet. The bed was super-comfortable and the room was clean as well. We booked a special rate that included full breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby. Good thing - since the menu was a bit pricey given what you got. The service: the experience with staff on duty ranged from rude to not being knowledgeable enough to be helpful, especially the concierge (the two that we interacted with) and the majority of the frontdesk staff. When you pay $300 plus a night (including parking and taxes), I would expect patience and helpfulness at the very least from staff. Great location - close to everything and easy access to 101 and 280 for quick jaunts to the nearby sites."
157,2101,"Sep 11 2007 	Average hotel overpriced for a 3.5 star hotel won't stay in it again	I ordered a business rate room because of the two things: it's on the highest floors and the breakfast was included in the price. To my disappointment the highest floor was the 5th floor and the breakfast only included coffee, juice and pastry. Everything else on the menu I was supposed to pay for. The room was small, the linens were ok, the bathroom floor was dirty, the sink drain was clotted. The thermostat wasn't working properly so I woke up in a 85 degree heat when in fact I always set it up for 68 degrees. The same thing was happening 2 nights in a row. So that I just shut it off and opened the window.Overall I found the hotel was overpriced for the quality of services it provided. I wouldn't stay in it during my next trip to SF."
158,2101,Sep 7 2007 	great hotel and location	We booked as a walk in and got a great rate at $249 for 2 Doubles. Hotel has a very comtempory/luxurious feel. Our room was very nice (a bit on the small side for 4 people) but would be great if 2 people took the same room. The location is great for Fisherman's Wharf and catching the tram to other locations. The staff were very professional and helpful. Only mishap was that one of the reception staff blocked our credit card through swiping it when the system had asked to call for verification.
159,2101,"Sep 2 2007 	So close to Wharf but quiet	Enjoyed the hotel, nice big room, lovely beds, very quiet (courtyard room), big TV, but no minibar. Ice maker and self service laundry available close by, pool and gym also good. Just set back from Fishermans Wharf it was the ideal location, and easy to get to city centre by bus or cable car. Fresh coffee every day to make in the room. Lovely breakfast bars just over the road - quicker and cheaper than the hotel.Didn't enjoy the cost of using the hotel phone at about $10/min - should have used my mobile! Also didn't enjoy the business centre PC for internet access - very expensive and poor. Money exchange rates at front desk - avoid at all cost.Overall a good hotel, which was comfortable, quiet and well located. No noise from neighbouring rooms at any time. Just watch out for and avoid the extras."
160,2101,"Aug 31 2007 	Perfect location for families with kids ages 7-12	Our family of 5 (my husband, 3 boys, and I) just spent 4 nights at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. If you are looking for a convenient location, clean, quiet room for a family -- this was great. We had 2 cable car stops within less than a 5 minute walk. We used them to go to Union Square, Lombard Street, Chinatown and the Cable Car Museum. We could walk to Ghiradelli Square, the Cannery, the Wharf, and Pier 39. We also could walk to our rental car pickup (Enterprise) and the F line (street car) easily. We used the F to get to the pier for the Alcatraz cruise and to go to the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market . We were able to take a city bus to the Marina easily. We also used the bus to go to Golden Gate Park (although it was a bit of a haul). We were only a block away from the firetruck tour -- which by the way, was the absolute best part of the trip!! I can't recommend it enough! My main point is that the Hyatt at the Wharf's location is great for families who are heading to San Francisco to sightsee. We debated as to whether we should stay in the Union Square or the Wharf area. The Wharf is definitely the way to go for sightseeing families with kids. The rooms were clean and the hotel was quiet. We did use the pool twice, but briefly -- it was chilly. The pool really shouldn't be a factor when choosing a hotel in San Francisco. There is so much to see and do. We got the Rise and Shine rate which included a full breakfast buffet (very nice) voucher for 2 people each morning. We actually used 4 of the vouchers for 2 of the mornings and paid the extra $9 for one child. That way we didn't feel obligated for all of us to eat there every morning. While the breakfast buffet was great, the dinner at the hotel restaurant was not the best -- and they charged for refills of the kids' lemonades. We had friends stay at the Argonaut at the same time. They said it was nice and it was only a block or two from us, so they had the same convenient location. I would probably try the Argonaut if I went again. Not because there was anything bad about the Hyatt -- we had no problems whatsoever. I just think the Argonaut looked a little bit nicer from the outside."
161,2101,"Aug 30 2007	great hotel. superb location BUT	We booked the Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf following trip advisor reviews. We arrived from out of the country at 1am in the morning for three nights with a confirmed booking. We were informed at reception that no rooms were available. I explained that we had a confirmed booking and showed the confirmation. Eventually, after me losing it , we were offered a lounge with a single roll away in it. we eventually got two beds, both short and uncomfortable with no choice of alternative hotels. We were marooned. We learned later in the stay we should have been walked to another HYATT hotel. We were never offered this choice . The night staff were particularly unhelpful and could not care less.The situation however was corrected the next morning , after five hours uncomfortable rest, by the duty manager who unlike his night staff was excellent. Would we use the Hyatt here again ? For comfort, appointment of rooms, the excellent bar man, RICK , and the restaurant along with the location..Definitely yes. But with caution. CHECK YOU HAVE CONIRMED ROOMS BEFORE you arrive and that they are available for you. We never recieved an explanation as to who had OUR booked room."
162,2101,"Aug 28 2007 	3rd time at this hotel!	We really like this hotel. The location is fantastic, the quality of the hotel is great - rooms great, bed great, breakfast buffet great and we find the service that the staff provide is really excellent. We always book a court yard, over sized room as there are 3 of us, including 1 teenager so the huge room is a bonus and being courtyard view these rooms are exceptionally quiet - no street noise, pool noise and we have never heard a peep from neighbors. Also have self serve laundry facilities is a huge bonus. Only 1 downside this time, the hotel has changed their decor for the most part to an utlra modern style - I really preferred the older, tradtional style - oh well."
163,2101,"Aug 28 2007 	Convenient	This hotel was convenient to the Wharf, 2 block walk and you are there. In what seemed to be a safe area to walk. Hotel parking is really expensive. The beds were very comfortable. Quite possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. The room was clean, a little bit on the small side, but not bad.Cable cars are 1 block away, and it's just a few blocks to catch the muni train.Knuckles restaurant next door had ok food for something relatively quick, however the waiter we had one night was horrible."
164,2101,"Aug 16 2007 	Great Hotel Loved the Bedding!	Overall....it was a great experience. Hyatt did a great job remodeling the rooms and the beds were by far the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel. The bedding was plush and very comfortable. The only problem we encountered was with someone from the front desk who didn't appear concerned with trying to work with us when we requested a room that was large enough to fit a roll out bed. As we were checking out I noticed that there was another couple who was having a hard time as well with the same front desk person. Everyone else was very nice and very helpful. One of the people who works at the concierge gave us wrong information regarding where to by trolley and bus passes. Honestly, some of the homeless were more helpful than this person was! Overall, we were very happy and would definitely go back!"
165,2101,"Aug 11 2007 	Great Hotel	My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon from the 11th - 18th June. We had booked via the website and asked for it to be noted that it was our honeymoon but even when we booked in we got a very basic room which was quite disappointing. However the staff were helpful, and the room, including the shower had been recently renovated. The Knuckles restaurant was great for breakfasts, the buffet was lovely. We had dinner there only the once and the restaurant was packed, took a while to be served and the food was ok, but there are so many other great restaurants in the area we weren't fussed. This hotel is in a great location, near Pier39, and a 5-10 mins walk from Ghiradelli's Square. All in all it was a wonderful start to our married life, just wish the staff could've been a bit more helpful/thoughtful when booking us in."
166,2101,Aug 8 2007	good choice for tourists	Stayed here with our 2 young children during a family vacation to San Francisco. Very sleek hotel that appears to have been recently renovated. The beds are incredibly comfortable! The rooms are spacious. Only negatives were restaurant sometimes had a wait for breakfast and the &quot;heated&quot; pool was nowhere near warm enough for outdoor swimming in typical San Francisco July weather. The immediate neighborhood was pretty blah but you are within easy walking distance of all the shops and restaurants at Pier 39 which we found very convenient for endof the day dining
167,2101,"Aug 3 2007	Better Than the Rest- Almost	A native San Franciscan, I was revisiting for a family reunion and know the area well. I thoroughly researched the current hotel situation (since I was staying for 5 nights) in Fishermen's Wharf and decided on the Hyatt.Last year I stayed at the Argonaut, which is excellent and better-located, but more expensive and the best rooms are not always available.The Hyatt is a solid, well-built hotel and the best of thegenre in the Wharf. Beds are very comfortable and all rooms are modern, clean, and sizeable. If possible, try to get a corner room facing something other than the common interior courtyard, which is bland and colorless. The corner rooms are larger andconsiderably more desirable than the standard rooms. Even if you have to pay a few dollars more, the price is worth it.Since all hotels in the Wharf cannot exceed 5 stories, you are not going to find a hotel that really faces the Bay (except for the more expensive Argonaut rooms- so don't even try.All in all, as a seasoned traveler, the Hyatt satisfied my needs,and I am a very finicky customer !"
168,2101,"Aug 1 2007 	A welcome retreat for throbbing feet	We explored SF for four days and really appreciated this hotel's great location. Found the rooms clean and well-equipped, and the staff pleasent. We had two children with us, aged 9 and five, who both enjoyed the comfy beds, TV, swimming pool and adjoining jacuzzi. The breakfast buffet was good but the staff were stretched on the weekend, so service could have been better. Also, we were disappointed that room service finished at 10pm, just as the kids were settling and Mum and Dad wanted a beer! Saying that, we would certainly pick this particular Hyatt again."
169,2101,"Jul 30 2007 	Hated the Bathroom!	We just got back from a 1-week stay at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf.....and I have mixed reviews. Staff:The hotel staff were ALL extremely friendly and helpful - very customer service orientated and each person we spoke to went out of their way to be polite and personable.Rooms:Our hotel room was....a little disappointing. Everything was nice and clean and comfortable, but the bathroom was awful! The doors didn't shut properly, there was no fan in the bathroom so it would get extremely fogged up. And the shower was.....fancy looking but not practical. At all.Knuckles:The bar/restaurant next door was great! I highly recommend visiting this establishment whether you stay at the Hyatt or not - excellent food and even better service: the bar staff were funny, friendly and very welcoming!Over all, I would recommend this hotel, but probably wouldn't stay there again and I was disappointed in the bathrooms!"
170,2101,"Jul 30 2007 	Nice but ""nickle and dime"" you	This is probably the nicest hotel in the Fisherman's Wharf area. The renovations are lovely--rooms are nicely done. The staff members are friendly and helpful; we liked the included hot breakfast buffet--except--the servers forget to refill the coffee. Our only issue was the extra charges--wireless internet in the room was extra, parking was overpriced, and they even charged an extra $7.99 per 15 minutes to use their computers and printers. Considering the room rates, these amenities should be included.Overall, though, it was a pleasant stay."
171,2101,"Jul 24 2007 	great location lousy food	great location, halfway between Ghiradeli Square and Pier 39. Had a king size bed which was nice, LCD sreen tv, even a docking station for your ipod. Towels were awfully thin for a five star hotel though! Our package included the bfast buffet at hotel restaurant--just ok. There was a storefront Breakfast cafe across the street that seemed to do a roaring business that might have been better (or the starbuck's behind the hotel). One night we were just too tired to go anywhere else for dinner so ate in the restaurant (Knuckles Sports Bar and Grill)---yuch. Ordered 3 appetizers: buffalo wings were ok, calamari was awful (couldn't chew it) and the artichoke dip was funny tasting. My watermelon margarita was very tasty but I was shocked at the $12 charge! We did voice our complaint and were offerred free appetizers for the next night although we didn't go back. With so many really great restaurants aroung fisherman's wharf, why bother?"
172,2101,"Jul 17 2007 	Above average	I stayed at this hotel for three nights. The room was a bit small compared to most Hyatt's I've stayed at, but it was well decorated, and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was decorated in a modern-style with the showerhead being located in the shower ceiling. The length of the shower stall was closer to that of a bathtub, and the door did not close. This caused a bit of water to splash out onto the bathroom floor, but it was a minimal amount. The door wasn't broken; it's just designed not to close. The reception staff in the lobby were very friendly, and they were more than happy to offer suggestions for local restaurants. The best thing about this hotel is the location. The wharf is a 5-minute walk, as are the trolley stops. Ghriadelli Square is about 15 minutes away, and Chinatown and Little Italy are a 25-30 minute walk. Overall, this is a nice hotel but not as nice as most Hyatt's. The prices are inflated due to its location, but you will be happy staying here."
173,2101,"Jul 9 2007 	Great Location - Nice Remodel - Parking Expensive	Had a delightful stay at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf. I already knew that the location of the hotel was excellent, but what was surprising was that amount of renovation work that had taken place in the hotel. The rooms have been completely redone and are decorated very nicely. Only thing that is a drawback is the television in the room. It is a little flat screen that looks absurd because it is so small. For 50 bucks more, they probably could have gotten a decent sized television. It appeared to be a 25 inch screen. The only downside to staying at this hotel is the parking. I know that it is expensive to park in San Francisco, but to pay 42 bucks a day . . . that's a bit extreme. If you are a guest, there should be a reasonable parking rate. That is like paying event parking prices in most major cities. Outrageous."
174,2101,"Jul 1 2007 	A world class superbly appointed property	If this is your first time to the tourist district of San Francisco and you want to stay near where the action is in a luxe, yet unostentatious environment, then the Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf is worth checking out (or I mean, in).Of all the hotel chains Ive stayed at, I find Hyatt the most consistent in terms of quality and experience. You can expect to find friendly, yet brisk guest services, quality furnishings, and well-appointed amenities, and top notch facilities. The Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf is no exception. Its low-rise, red-brick facade exudes warmth and elegance.The lobby is small, although functional. It has a corner that is updated with a touch of post-modernism, with quirky furniture and paintings.The guestroom is superbly appointed with a plush, soft bed and smooth, clean sheets. The bathroom boasts generously sized amenities from Portico Spa. The spacious guestroom also features a multifunction workstation with an ergonomic chair that will please the traveler who unfortunately has to tow work along. There is Wi-Fi service throughout the hotel via T-Mobile.Hyatt seems well-aware that there is a growing crowd of fitness conscious travelers to whom going on a vacation does not mean a holiday from their fitness regime, and is eager to tap into this market. It has an outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi, and a newly-renovated 24-hour StayFit fitness center. It consists primarily of cardio machines such as treadmills, elliptical machines, stationary bikes, and a small but adequate free weights corner.On top of the consistent Hyatt touch, this property benefits from proximity to area attractions such as Alcatraz, Pier 39, the postcard pretty Golden Gate Bridge, and the shopping mecca of San Franciscos Union Square."
175,2101,"Jun 29 2007 	Stay at your own peril	While this newly renovated is Asian inspired with all the fine lines it gave me the worst hotel experience ever. The room was okay and cold feeling just like the staff that works there. I guess no one reminded the managers and mostly front desk clerk that they work in the hospitality industry. Worst of all security at this hotel is nil so be very careful staying at this hotel as you will be putting property and may be even life in danger. I was robbed at this hotel right by the front desk. The hotel is prowling with thieves thinly disguised as couples. There is no security at this hotel. The security video is so bad at this hotel that if you are robbed the quality of the picture will not assist the authorities in apprehending the perpetrators, hence they will continue to operate until they are caught in the act. Except for Jorge the Porter who had a nice friendly smile, this hotel is as cold as the decor."
176,2101,Jun 18 2007 	Great Stay	Newly Refurbished about 6 months ago - beds are extremely comfy. Room is a litle small but served its purpose. Staff is extemely friendly and went overboard to make sure my 2 year old was comfortable. Called for towels at 2am and got them in 3 minutes! Location is great 2 blocks off Fisherman's Wharf - close enough to the action without being in the middle of it. Trader Joe's and Safeway are a block away for any necessities. Get the buffet breakfast included in your stay - great deal and delicious food. Knucles Sports Bar was perfect for lunch or late night snacks. Cable Car pickup only about a block away. Would recommend to all.
177,2101,"Jun 15 2007 	great stay	Hotel very convenient to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Alcatraz Cruise terminal and many restaurants. Booked hotel and parking plan and was pleased with room and valet parking. Security of parking lot was very good. Tour company booked through concierge was excellent and they picked us up right in front of hotel. Restaurant attached to hotel was good for quick meals. Room was clean and well appointed."
178,2101,"Jun 7 2007 	great location quiet and nice hotel	We really liked the location of this hotel  on North Point Street, near the activity of the marina but not right in the thick of it. Its a very quiet hotel. We had neighbors, but I never heard them once. Nice heated pool and hot tub. The rooms are decorated in a blue and brown modern theme, which we liked very much but which wouldnt appeal to everyone. Only a few downsides for us, one of which was the bathroom  it was beautiful, but the sliding doors didnt close completely or lock, and the shower was only half enclosed, meaning that youre in there and the back half of the shower was open. This led to water getting out and it being a little colder because the steam could escape. Also, the shower head was a rain type shower head from the ceiling. Very nice, except that you have to reach under it to turn the water on, so you got a cold blast to the head when you reach forward. And one other picky thing  the ice bucket is so tiny that we couldnt have two cans of soda in the ice at the same time. So one of us had to drink it warm. I asked for a second can and they said sure, but it never turned up. I didnt follow up. And finally, the internet access was awful. $10.00 for a day, and you have to connect through the television. The keyboard was awful, you had to POUND on the keys to get them to type anything and it was totally frustrating. I spent about an hour online to do what would take five minutes at home. And the reason we got the access was to check my husbands work e-mail, which we couldnt do anyway since it wasnt a secure enough connection. And if you bring a laptop, you cant use it for internet in the room anyway. We didnt check out the sports bar because there were so many other great places to eat and drink nearby. But, for the main things  the location and the room, it was great. The bed was fantastic, as were the pillows, and the people were very nice. Id stay here again for sure."
179,2101,"Jun 2 2007 	A fine hotel accommodating staff	My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt for two nights--one pre-cruise and one post-cruise, so the stays were 10 nights apart. We enjoyed both nights, and would stay at this hotel again. Both times we arrived well before check-in but were immediately given a room by a friendly front-desk agent, and the rooms were well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. One niggling minor problem--bathroom doors don't have a latch (they slide together and meet in the middle). Hotel location was great--right in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf, not far from pier to catch cruise ship or ferry to Alcatraz, or alternatively walk in the other direction to Ghiradelli Square. We had hotel breakfast included in the rate for the first night, and it was certainly adequate. We chose the buffet, which had a nice selection. Second night we didn't have breakfast in the rate, so we walked across the street to a little cafe and ate well there, too. Highly recommend!"
180,2101,"May 24 2007 	Great views!	Stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf for three nights in mid-May. Asked for a room with a view upon check-in. The clerk said they are not known for their views being only four stories tall, but he would do the best he could and he certainly did. Room #529 had views of Coit Tower, the Oakland Bay Bridge, and the Transamerica Pyramid. A great room, spacious with a sitting area, clean, nicely decorated, flat screen tv, Starbuck's coffee in the room with to-go cups, and big windows that open. All this for only $189 per night - unbelievable! Ordered breakfast from room service one morning and it was better than a restaurant. Will definitely stay here again. Also a great location, only two blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, a bookstore across the street, and cable car outside the side hotel door. Connected to Knuckles Historic Sports Bar which serves meals also and two small restaurants for breakfast and lunch directly across the street."
181,2101,"May 17 2007 	Good clean fine hotel	Everything about this hotel is fine, though nothing stood out as being anything amazing. The location is perfect in Fisherman's Wharf, easy to get to everything, though the Wharf itself was a bit disappoiting, 3 days there was enough as it lacked any real depth. The Hotel room was modern, clean, a good size and new so no complaints about the room at all. The bar was ok, but nothing special at all and didn't really seem to fit with the hotel. The hotel staff were nice enough, but didn't exactly go out of their way to assist with anything when asked. Maybe it's the English accent :o)"
182,2101,"May 17 2007 	Good times	This hotel is really good and very well located for sight seeing san francisco.It was near all the public transport to see the sights.The rooms are spacious,the beds are like sleeping on clouds more comfortable than my bed at home.I could not find any dirt and the rooms modern and tastefully decorated.The bathroom was good with good amenities.The shower was not as good as at home but it cleaned you.The hotel staff were all very friendly and most helpful.Knuckles bar and restaurant was great you could find locals in there.The staff were efficent and very friendly,we liked them all but Nancy was the best.The food choice was good and reasonably priced as well as the drinks.It was great with all the television screens expecially so when the golden state warriors played basketball.We have become fans and learnt the rules of the game.I recommend this hotel as you recieve good service and is well located clean and safe.If I came back to San francisco we would stay here again."
183,2101,"Apr 3 2007 	Had a really good stay	Stayed here one night. Not a location I'd normally choose, but had a free night from Hyatt and it was the only Hyatt hotel I could get into in the Bay Area. The hotel ended up being sold out by the time I arrived, but I received the room type I requested. I asked for a quiet room and was told by the friendly front desk clerk that the hotel is &quot;a very quiet hotel.&quot; I've heard that story before, but it really was true. Normally I'd like a view, but as this hotel is only 5 stories high, most of the street-facing rooms look into hotels that are across the street. And the streets around the hotel are pretty busy with traffic, vehicular and pedestrian.My room was on the second floor overlooking a &quot;courtyard,&quot; which is just the roof of the hotel. It's pretty claustrophobic, but I just wanted a good night's sleep and I got one. Although the hotel was full, I didn't hear a sound all night. And my room was an adjoining room. The place is built like a bunker, and is incredibly well insulated. I got a newly remodeled room that was very stylish (something you'd see on &quot;Top Design&quot; when they designed hotel rooms) in a blue/brown motif. The only part of the room not redone was the old white bathroom tile surrounding the tub. That looked bad. The rest looked great. (I've stayed at the Grand Hyatt on Union Square in the past, but their rooms are in such dire need of a makeover, I'm trying to avoid the place until they spend some money making them look a little less like, well, 1987).My experience with all the employees was terrific... everyone was exceptionally courteous. Didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but there are many places to eat nearby. I got an Egg McMuffin and ate it sitting on a bench overlooking the bay. Highly recommend it.The only downside of my stay? Parking is a rip-off at $43 a night (including tax). Nearby lots charged at least $30 overnight, but you do get valet service at the hotel. Had to wait about 25 minutes for my car when I checked out, but the valets were really working hard to fetch cars (everyone was leaving at the same time), so it wasn't their fault. All in all, a surprisingly good stay at a very nicely redone hotel (some public areas still sport the old decor, which is rather incongruous with the new design). I'm not sure I love the neighborhood (wildly tourist-y in a slighty seedy way) or would come back for another stay for that very reason, but it's an excellent choice if you want to be 3 blocks away from Fisherman's Wharf."
184,2101,Mar 28 2007 	Great Stay!!!	I just got back from a stay here and have to say this was a great hotel. The staff was excellent. Very friendly and helpful and the location was perfect. Rooms were clean and decorated nicely. The only complaint is that the shower head is very low. I would definitely stay here again and again!
185,2101,Mar 28 2007	Great Hotel Great Location	The Hyatt was a great hotel. The interior design was beautiful in the room and the staff was overly friendly and eager to help in any way that they could. The hotel is close to several great resturants and very close to cable car stops. I would stay here again without a second thought!
186,2101,"Mar 10 2007	Excellent Service and Location	We booked our room through [--] for $109 a night. The location of the Hyatt is tough to beat if your are looking for something near Fisherman's Wharf. We were easily able to walk to all of the shops at Fisherman's Wharf and Gharadelli Square. The rooms have been recently updated in a modern style (think black, white, grey color-scheme). The beds were very comfortable and our interior room was very quiet. We had neighbors on both sides and did not hear them. The service from the point we entered the hotel to the point we left was flawless. Excellent staffing and great overall service.The main downsides to the Hyatt are the parking costs (with tax it was $42 a night) and the view if you were looking for one. Most rooms either look over the road or the interior area (which is actually rooms looking at other rooms). Just be on notice that they are still doing some renovations to the hotel and while we were not disturbed by the work that is just something to be aware of -"
187,2101,"Feb 27 2007	Great Hotel	San Francisco, Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf. Date: 19 to 22 January 2007. This was the first stay of our 4 week long round the world holiday. We transfered from San Francisco Airport via the shuttle bus (as the Hyatt had suggested which was really easy) and were welcomed at the hotel with the porter taking the bags and with reception who had everything ready and explained the hotel facilities. The room was spacious and very comfortable with all modern fittings. - Just as we had hoped it would be. The hotel itself is well placed to see/visit the attractions and just within walking distance to the piers and harbour front and the cable car terminal is just at the rear of the hotel. The hotel restaurant is more of a brunch eatery but well serviced with a good menu. There are plenty of restaurants close to the hotel. The staff at the Hyatt were very friendly and helpful in every respect. The hotel lives up to its 3 star plus rating - I've stayed in worse 4 Star hotels. I'd certainly stay at the Hyatt again and can recommend it to anyone wishing to stay at San Francisco. - Great comfortable Hotel."
188,2101,"Feb 4 2007	Average experience	Stayed at this Hyatt for two nights in January 2006. Rooms are updated with a retro modern decor in brown and light blue color scheme. Comfortable bedding but a dried spot of some unmentionable was seen on one of the cloth-covered headboards. Room 629.Booked it with the AAA rate and a code that included breakfast in the sports themed restaurant. This really made the stay. The breakfast buffet was the best I have seen at this type of hotel. Hotel is still finishing renovations. Concierge was very helpful. Walk and take public transportation, as parking is expensive."
189,2101,Jan 29 2007 	Loved the location	We stayed here January 26th-January 28th. Loved the room. Very modern and also loved the flat screen TV. Fishermans wharf is only about 10 minutes from the hotel. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only con is that the toliet holder kept falling down and the noise outside was very loud. Other than that it was a great stay. I would definately recommend this to anyone.
190,2101,"Jan 16 2007 	Greatfriendlymodernclean 	After reading some of the reviews of this hotel I think we must have stayed at a different Hyatt to these other people!We stayed for 5 days from the 2nd of January 2007 and found no problems with it at all.The room was spotless with contemporary decor and furnishings,wall mounted TV and newly upgraded,spacious shower room.The bed was big and comfy and the whole room was nice to chill out in after a hard day's sightseeing.There was a coffee machine in our room which was great and the complementary toiletries were good too.We found all the staff to be polite and helpful at all times.This hotel is in an excellent location if you want to do all the touristy stuff.I would definately stay here again,we thought it was great :)"
191,2101,"Dec 21 2006 	Great Hotel!!	We stayed 3 nights at the hotel in the beginning of December. The rooms have all been refurbished, and our room on the 3rd floor was spacious and extremely clean. Flat screen tv and good bedding. Shame about the shower only, and no bath, but then again, we didn't go to San Francisco to stay in the bath!!The reception staff were very helpful and did everything to make our stay enjoyable. I would definately go back to the hotel. I beleive that it is the best in the Wharf area, as their are many hotels in the area that look tatty next to the Hyatt."
192,2101,"Oct 28 2006 	Do not park at this hotel	The hotel was nothing of what you would expect from a Hyatt. It was truly overpriced but the location was good. The parking was unbelievable. $28 a day, regardless if you put your car in at 11:59 pm at night the previous day and 8 in the morning the next day. I wasn't impressed."
193,2101,"Oct 27 2006	Nice Hotel  Unreliable booking system and VERY expensive parking!	We stayed here during our coast-to-coast drive across the US. The hotel has a very good location just a few blocks walk from Fishermans Wharf. We checked in about 18:00 to be told they had no King rooms left. This always annoys me when the online booking specifically offers a type of room and then the hotel tells you it was only a preference based on availability. The room we got had two queen beds and was new and clean, but the dcor was rather bland. The wireless internet was an extra fee - at the time I was used to this because internet is always extra in the UK, but now Ive stayed at 30+ US hotels during this road trip I now realise almost all of them now offer it for free! We had room service that evening which was quite nice, but the waiter was not very friendly. Overall my biggest problem with this hotel is the very expensive parking at $38 plus tax!"
194,2101,"Oct 24 2006 	60s retro here we come	Stayed here half-way through our honeymoon. Hadnt pre-booked the hotel, just drove around Fishermans Wharf and this was the most reasonably priced hotel we could find. Great location in the city centre  just five minutes from Fishermans Wharf. Parking also available within the hotel grounds, but quite pricey as it was a valet service. Hotel dcor was contemporary 60s-esque but quite nice  very classy feeling! Convenient sports bar next door for eating/drinking locally, but also within stumbling distance of some very good bars  a few of which were Irish! Would definitely recommend staying here to others whilst visiting San Francisco."
195,2101,"Oct 16 2006 	Don't get stuck in the Hyatt FW	Was encouraged by the positive reviews, the location and the description of the modern rooms . What I found was unhelpful and, aside from a few exceptions, uninterested front desk personnel, an indeed very modern but dirty room, and an ambiance that caters not to tourists but solely to the convention/conference crowd.Got a fourth floor room with a malfunctioning A/C. It took three calls to the front desk and seemingly endless waiting for an engineer to fix the electrical problem and a completely clogged filter to be cleaned. The room looked like it had not been used in a while. Dust, bar glasses not quite clean, you name it, it just didn't fit the Hyatt image. The windows opened though, and it was nice to get some fresh air while waiting for the engineer to show. TV (Samsung Flatpanel LCD) had lots of channels and very informative documentary on San Fran. Parking valet (when he was around) was very helpful and relatively quick.Breakfast was the worst I have had in a long time. Room rate ($259 a night) included full american breakfast and parking. You do the math, but if I can get fresh danishes at Safeway across the street (practically) why is it so hard for the Hyatt to deliver same to the breakfast buffet? No yoghurt, one kind of hot cereal in a utilitarian, aluminum heating (not serving) unit, one kind of juice (couldn't tell it was actually OJ, so I didn't bother tasting), three kinds of fruit cut up in large pieces in three separate serving trays next to the hot food so it actually looked like more than it was. The scrambled eggs were surprisingly fresh, but the bagels, muffins and danishes were at least a day old (no kidding). Would have had to pay full price for everything else on the menu but the Two Eggs Any Style (the most expensive item) and I didn't trust the kitchen enough to incur the additional expense, so the buffet was a no-brainer.The location, as others have mentioned, is pretty good. That's about all the Hyatt FW has going for it. I will definitely not be back."
196,2101,"Oct 5 2006 	Filthy filthy filthy!	This hotel is the reason I stopped using priceline to book rooms. It was filthy! Dried urine on the floor in the bathroom, stained carpets, dust an inch thick on the bathroom lights, and mold in the shower. I travel frequently to SF and recommend staying away from this hotel. I wish I had my camera to show the filth. With all the other wonderful hotels in SF, I would stay away from this one!!! You couldn't pay me to stay there again. Oh, and as compensation for the dried urine on the floor, I was given a &quot;breakfast ticket&quot; for the following day. Priceline also gave me a credit for misrepresentation (it was supposed to be a 4 star hotel)."
197,2101,"Sep 14 2006 	Great location very nice hotel	My husband and I, and 2 kids (4 and 7) stayed at the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf from 8/23-8/26. We booked a room through HotWire for $139 a night. What a fantastic deal. On a map, it looks like certain hotels appear closer to certain attractions at Fisherman's Whart. This one looked like it could be a bit of a walk, but in reality, was in very close walking distance to everything we wanted to see, but was far enough that we didn't feel like we were on a very busy, noisy street. We arrived at the hotel from the airport at around 1:00. Even though check-in wasn't until much later, they gave us our room right away, and were unpacked and off sightseeing by 2:00. I felt like we had a whole day ahead of us. The hotel is very nice. The rooms are small, but no smaller than a New York City hotel. Actually, I was pleased to find a desk area and a small sitting area where my kids ate cereal for breakfast in the room everyday (to save time and money). There is a supermarket right by, and everything else you may need. One of my favorite perks was finding a washer/dryer laundry area on our floor. That really came in handy, and was very convenient for us to laundry when we got back to the hotel one night. The only downside was no refrigerator or minibar in the room. That would have been a nice addiion. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was very nice and helpful. I would definetely stay here again. Even at the full price that we found on the internet (around $229 a night during the time we went), it would have been worth it. We did not go to the attached restaurant, but it looked nice, and wasn't too formal for young children. Fisherman's Wharf is very touristy, and a little cheesey. On the other hand, I wouldn't stay anywhere else with small kids. We went to Alcatraz, did the duck boat tour (a must!), walked around the wharf and went to restaurants there, rode the trolley, etc. It was all within quick walking distances for us, with 4 and 7 year olds. It was also a quick cab ride to get home from Chinatown after dinner etc. I also recommend a trip to Muir Woods. It was beautiful."

199,2101,"Aug 22 2006 	Customer Service Was The Best!	On the hotel website we booked a &quot;Deluxe Room&quot; for $269 a night. We decided to pay the extra $50 a night to have the &quot;extra sitting area&quot; so our 18 month old daughter can sleep in the corner while we watch TV. We check in and we were greeted by &quot;all our rooms are deluxe rooms.&quot; &quot;Some corner rooms are slightly bigger and have a sitting area.&quot; My impression was that we were going to pay $50 extra a night for an extra two feet of space. Rene made things right, she upgraded us to the executive suite. 42 inch LCD tv in one room, 32 inch LCD tv in the other. Nice two sink bathroom and plush king size bed. Thank you Rene!The restaurant Knuckles has great food but horrible service. Hopefully it was an isolated issue. I had to track down our waitress twice. Once to take our drink order and another time to take our food order. Even so I gave her a good tip because the atmosphere and food were great. So many TV's, I didn't know what game to watch. Great video games for kids (and adults).Kudos to Rene, she made our trip very enjoyable! But don't book online, book directly through the hotel."
200,2101,"Aug 18 2006 	Good family choice	Got our room the morning of our stay for $95 on Priceline (best online rate I could find was $210). The room was pleasantly comfortable and looked like it had been renovated in the previous year or so -- great beds, nice shower, good 42-inch LCD with about 35 channels. We had nice weather so the kids checked out the pool -- small, only 3-1/2 feet deep. Parking at the Hyatt was $38 plus tax, which is about standard for that block.For those of you who've never stayed in Fisherman's Wharf, there are about six chain hotels right next to one another along North Point and Bay Streets. If traveling alone or just with my wife, I might have instead stayed at one of the two nearby Kimpton hotels (Argonaut, Tuscan Inn), but the Hyatt was terrific for a family stay."
201,2101,"Jul 26 2006 	Great place to stay near the Wharf!	We booked through Priceline and got the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf for $90 a night. Having heard some bad experiences about Priceline customers getting small rooms and such, we were a little worried. No need to be...I called Hyatt upon learning of my winning bid and requested a King non-smoking room. We arrived and were given just that and more. Our room was beside the Governor's suite and was quite large. A separate dressing area and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi greeted us as we opened the door. The location is terrific...just a half block from the Cable cars and two blocks from the Wharf. Safe neighborhood...we walked everywhere and had no problems. The staff was friendly and helpful and the bed was about the best we've ever slept on in a hotel. The room had recently been renovated and had a new LCD tv and new furnishings. Would we return to the Hyatt? We're already planning another trip!"
202,2101,"Jul 22 2006	They believe in great customer service!	Spent three days at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf in July06 for business. The most comfortable room with all the amenities, except mini bar. All staff great, from check-in to front desk to car valets to servers in the restaurant."
203,2101,"Jul 21 2006 	Great location great service	This is a nice hotel in an excellent location, near all the great attractions of Fisherman's Wharp, Pier 39, Ghiradelli, etc. Although I was on a business trip, I brought my family along (including 10 year old boy &amp; 5 year old girl) and we stayed five nights.Overall, the service was outstanding. The valet parking was always prompt, and the valet attendent knew me by name by the second day. The front desk was very helpful with driving directions and getting information on road conditions for the remainder of our travel through California.The room was average size, sufficient for the four of us. The bathroom had an odd sink that was very shallow, causing water to spill over occasionally on my 5-year-old.My only real complaint is that there was no refridgerator in the room. This would have been nice for storing left-overs from the wonderful restaurants in the area.I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers; at the same time, it is above average for tourists."
204,2101,"Jul 16 2006	Great Hotel	Great place to stay. Has a pool, spa, gym and good service. Convenient to Fishermans Wharf and all points around. Great for families. We had a recently renovated room with two really comfortable beds (except they were only doubles and I am used to a bigger queen). Otherwise it was a good choice. Staff were helpful and recommended a GREAT Chinese Restaurant called The Madarin at nearby Giradelli Square. Also the Sunrise Cafe across the road is recommended for tasty and (relatively inexpensive) breakfasts. The Knuckles Bar and Grill underneath was also good, with great staff.Hyatt sometimes are more expensive than other chains, but a little extra cost brings comfort, relaxation, convenience and peace of mind, not to mention facilties when travelling with your family in a unfamiliar city."
205,2101,"Jul 1 2006	Really enjoyed our stay	We booked the hotel through priceline for $75 a night. Upon arrival after requesting a nice room they offered an upgrade for $90 to the newly renovated top floor. We looked at both rooms and went with the hip, newly renovated one. My husband and I loved it, beautiful king bed, flat screen TV, contemporary funrnishings and a great location (if you're doing all the touristy things). Walking distance from North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf. As is the case in SF, parking was really expensive ($35 a night), but most convenient as they offer a flat rate with in-and-out services.The concierge was very helpful and recommended some very good places. Our favorite was breakfast at Pat's Cafe, a great way to start the day. Wonderful home style pancakes and waffles, free wirless internet, great service.We highly recommedn the Segway tours, a novel experience, bit pricy though. The SFMOMA is worth a visit for anyone interested in modern art. Also if you have half a day, the 49 mile drive takes you through all of San Francisco and is a great way to get the flavor of the entire city (pre-print the map - some signs have been stolen)."
206,2101,"Jun 6 2006	Great Hotel Great Location	We stayed in a newly renovated room. The room was lovely. The bed was the best bed I ever slept in, including at home!The location is great. Fishermans wharf is a cute area, and the trolley stop is around the corner so you can take the trolley up to Chinatown or North Beach. Ghirardelli Square is just around the corner.The downside  Parking is $36 a day. There is no concierge floor."
207,2101,"May 29 2006	Great Hotel with great service!	Fabulous room with the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on (and we're seasoned travellers!) Very nicely decorated - lovely bathroom with walk in &quot;wet-room&quot; shower, and huge mirror. Staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Great facilities in the room, including wall-mounted LCD TV, and we really do need to stress just how comfortable that bed was. Nothing else has ever come close!Our two negatives were:&gt; Fishermans wharf ain't the greatest place in the world, in all honesty. The one plus of this was that there was a tram stop just around the corner which made Union Street and China Town easily accessible.&gt; The diner (&quot;Knuckles&quot;) didn't impress for breakfast - we tried it once and decided to go elsewhere from then on. Could have been a one off, but we certainly experienced better food in SF.Overall, though, we'd go back without a second thought - we really genuinely enjoyed our stay."
208,2101,"May 5 2006	Just the room - no free bells and whistles - hang on to your wallet!	First let me start out by saying that we look for value when we are on vacation - we're usually looking for a place that has internet - so we can finalize the plan the next day, a complementary breakfast in the morning - nothing major - just some coffee, pastries for the kids. We have become *spoiled* I guess by great stays at Quality Inns - they have all these things and more!We stayed here for 2 nights primarily for the location - it's just a couple of blocks to the wharf! That's the BEST thing about this hotel.I'm very glad we did the Priceline thing - we were able to get the room for $92, well short of the $170 normal rate and as it turns out, the hotel did it's very best to get the rest of the money - parking is valet only ($36/day + taxes!)- there is no free internet, but for only $10/day you can access that - no complementary breakfast nor was there a coffee maker in the room! The room was nice and comfortable but very small.You just get the room! After a 2 day stay we were out about $300"
209,2101,"May 4 2006 	Enjoyed our stay	My son and I recently stayed at Hyatt at the wharf and it was well above average. Room size was what is to be expected in a major city downtown location. Room features, cleanliness and comfort were excellent. No view whatsoever as you would know from just a bit of research. The location is very good. Knuckles, the lobby restaurant was quite good for breakfast which is the only meal we ate there. The bar at Knuckles was staffed by some of the friendliest and best tenders and waitresses I've run into anywhere. Always check parking and restaurant prices before you book in any city. Prices at the Hyatt were what you'd expect in a location like this in a city like this. I will stay at this hotel again and would recommend to others."
210,2101,"Mar 25 2006 	There are better hotels out there.	The pluses:-The hotel is in a good location if you want to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf and be close to Northbeach/Chinatown.-Excellent beds. If you need a lot of rest and not interested in being out, this is a great hotel for it. But, then again, why pay Fisherman's Wharf prices, when you can stay somewhere else with much better rates?-The rooms have recently been upgraded with very comfortable plush beds, flat screen TVs, and new fixtures. -There's a decent size lap pool and jacuzzi.-There's also a work out room and a laundry room.The negatives:-Absolutely no view. I had one of the better views on the 5th floor. I paid extra ($20/day) to upgrade so that I can view the Coit tower. When I got to the room, I realized that although I can indeed see the tower, there's a much better view of the Petco, 76, and Cost Plus Market! Their store lights prevented me from leaving my window open to see the better view in the distance.-The wireless internet is NOT free! This is SF folks! We have the most amount of free wireless in the US. Tip: I managed to use the wireless connection from the Radisson nearby for free.- Although this is supposed to be an upgraded room, the dresser bulb is missing and there's a bulb out in the bathroom. There is also no mini bar and no real desk to work in.- There are never enough towels and they are not nice towels!- The hotel guest information book is outdated and incomplete. We ordered room service and half of the menu items were no longer offered and the prices are wrong. No information in it on where amenities were (ie. pool, check out time, etc.)- If you do decide to stay here, you'll be tempted to order room service. Don't! The food is not very good and is over priced, not to mention does not come as it is described on the menu. For example, the Continental breakfast for $10.95 that comes with a basket of danishes, actually has two very very small danish (same size as a sweetener package), plus a 2 cup pot of coffee and glass of orange juice. To top it off, we were charged the new price of $16.95 plus the $2.50 delivery and the 18% service charge. The corned beef hash tasted like it came out of a can, and the baby back ribs had no BBQ sauce (as described on the menu). I've ordered room service in every hotel I've ever stayed at and understand that the prices are always exurberant, but I am more often than not satisfied with the food. Not at this Hyatt!- The elevator is located in one section and is not in the center! Some people are lucky enough to be located near it, but for most, it's going to be long trek.- Parking is $36 a night regardless if you're a guest or not. (TIP: There are free parking spaces at the end of Beach street for 4 hours maximum and near the Argonaut for max 2 hours)Overall, it's not the worse hotel you can be in. But, there are better choices out there."
211,2101,"Mar 21 2006	Great location!	My sister and I stayed here for a few nights and loved it. The location was absolutely fabulous (located only one block from street car and trolley stops and two blocks from the Wharf and Pier 39). We stayed in one of the newly remodelled rooms and thought it was really nice and spacious for us. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful too. We would definitly plan on staying here again. I highly recommend getting breakfast at the Hollywood Cafe across the street. They have the best freshly squeezed orange juice! If you're in the area on the weekend, try to take the street car to the Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building...it was amazing!"
212,2101,"Mar 7 2006	Not bad for kids	The key to this hotel is the location. If you have kids this is a great base for exploring San Francisco. You can walk to nearby attractions or take the cable car across town.The hotel was slightly dated, as most Hyatt's are these days, but the room was nicely decorated and the linens were luxurious.Parking is expensive, but convenient."
213,2101,"Jan 26 2006	Great location but nothing fancy.	My wife and I have stayed here with friends twice. Both times were average experiences. Hotels.com offered discounted rates both times we stayed. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. Each stay we had a view of the roof of an adjacent building. We decided to stay there due to proximity to the wharf and available parking. Parking is $35. May stay again, but will look for something with more ammenties."
214,2101,"Dec 22 2005	Excellent location overall a great hotel	My husband and I, along with his parents and brother, stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf on December 16th and had a great experience. Not only was the staff extremely friendly and welcoming, but the hotel was in an excellent location and exceeded our expectations given the extremely reasonable rate they offered on line. I had used trip advisor to narrow down our list of possible hotels and can't figure out what some of the other reviewers were referring to when they said that the rooms were dirty and not up to a 4-star rating. We found the hotel to be very clean and the beds were some of the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. The noise level was low and because my in-laws plane came in late that night we opted to eat at the restaurant's Bar and Grill which was reasonably priced and everyone enjoyed their meal. The restaurant offered a pretty basic menu, but all of the dishes were great and we were thrilled to be able to eat in such a convenient location given the late hour (11pm). At the suggestion of another reviewer, we caught a quick breakfast at the Sunrise Cafe across the street the next morning before heading out for a day of sightseeing. Overall, an extremely positive experience and I will definately recommend this hotel to other family and friends who come to San Francisco for a visit!"
215,2101,"Dec 12 2005	A real disappointment	We booked to stay for 3 nights at Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf on the understanding that this was one of the best hotels in the Fisherman's Wharf area. If this was one of the best, I dread to think what some of the others are like.In hindsight, it was a mistake to stay at Fisherman's Wharf anyway. Myself and my husband spent part of our honeymoon in San Francisco three years ago but stayed near Union Square. At the time, we seemed to be travelling down to Fisherman's Wharf a lot for Alcatraz, Pier 39 etc so it made sense just to stay down there this time. In fact, we ended up spending nearly all of our time away from there! I don't know what has happened in three years, but it seemed to feel more unsafe, more seedy, more tacky and there were certainly more beggars down there. We could hardly walk out of our hotel without getting hassled by someone, and therein lies the first problem of Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf.As for the hotel itself, that too, was extremely disappointing. The lobby was beautiful but unfortunately, not maintained well. The carpeting was filthy and all of the public areas just felt like they needed a good clean. There was a strange, musty smell that hung in the air too. I'm not a prima donna in any way and I've stayed in plenty of lower class hotels that were clean and well maintained, but this hotel just screamed 'unloved' and it is clearly ageing before its time.Our room I would call fairly basic (and certainly not 4*) but at least that was clean and I guess we spent more time in the room than public areas so it was more important for the room to be clean. However, it shouldn't have to be an either/or situation. The decor made the room feel dingy and dated even though it probably wasn't done THAT long ago. The bed was very comfortable though, and we made good use of the numerous cable channels on offer. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room but the hotel did offer complimentary coffee at a station down the corridor which was handy.We ate breakfast at the hotel's only on-site restaurant, &quot;Knuckles&quot; for convenience more than anything else. The food was ok, nothing special though. We felt it was overpriced for what it was.The staff overall were trying their best but were mainly young and inexperienced. They also weren't very forthcoming with a smile or cheery hello.On the whole, we found our whole experience at Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf very disappointing and it's for certain that if we return to San Francisco, we'll be staying neither there, or at the Fisherman's Wharf area in general."
216,2101,"Oct 26 2005 	Just Ho-Hum	I stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf for two nights for a conference and paid a discounted rate of $169. The staff were very friendly and efficient, but the hotel was a little on the small side and not what I expected of a 4-star rating. My room was adequate, but not particularly clean or interesting. The conference spaces felt cramped. If I had paid full price, I would have been extremely disappointed. The location is great for visiting Fisherman's Wharf. It is in walking distance of seafood restaurants, the sea lions, the ferry to Alcatraz, Ghirardelli Square, and the cable car turnaround. But once you've seen those things, there isn't much to explore. After the conference, I moved to a hotel in Union Square &amp; greatly preferred being in the heart of the city."
217,2101,"Oct 13 2005	Fine for the $$	My husband and I stayed for 5 nights at the Hyatt, October 5th  10th. I would say that yes, it defiantly is not Hyatt quality but it is not horrible like some of the reviews have read. It is in need of renovations, the carpets desperately. The staff was nice and friendly. Location was great! We booked through priceline and so were not guaranteed a specific room. I called a few days ahead of time to request a king size room, we were put in a room with 2 double beds the first night. They didn't have any king rooms available until the 2nd night so they told us to have all of our stuff packed up and they would switch us the next morning. So we went about our day and came back to a king room. I thought that was great that they accommodated our request even though nothing is guaranteed through priceline. The beds were very comfortable, one of the most comfortable hotel beds that we have ever slept on. All in all, it was a great experience; San Francisco is a amazing city. We didn't eat at the hotel due to previous reviews and we feel as though, hotels are in the hotel business, not the restaurant. We have never had a fabulous meal at a hotel so we just choose to stay away from all hotel restaurants."
218,2101,"Oct 12 2005	A very convenient hotel.	We chose the Hyatt at Fishermans Wharf after much deliberation, after having read varying opinions on Trip Advisor. We are so glad we chose this hotel as it was a really enjoyable stay. We wanted to be in Fishermans Wharf area, and we were ideally placed for all the tourist spots. The hotel has a sort of faded elegance and could maybe do with a bit of general modernisation. But that said it couldn't be faulted for everything else. The staff in particular where first class, from the front desk to the room maids, everyone was so pleasant and seemed as if they enjoyed working there. The beds are the most comfortable we have ever slept on and we had more pillows than we have ever had in any other hotel ( we normally have to ask for more).We had asked for a room near to the elevator and that is what we got, on looking around the hotel we could see what other reviewers meant about the miles of corridors. They did seem as if they would be confusing.We stayed 14 nights and ate several times in Knuckles which was what it said it was (a sports bar). It got a bit too noisy for my Mother some nights but the food was good and again the staff of top quality. The hotel pool and spa area were a delight especially in a San Francisco hotel where they are scarce anyway. It was so great to come back at the end of a busy day and be able to swim or sit in the hot tub. Plenty of towels are provided at the pool so you don't have to take them from your room.We had a top class stay and would visit again in a heartbeat, Even the rate we paid was reasonable for the area."
219,2101,"Oct 11 2005	Extravagant Rates and Filthy Rooms	This hotel simply has not been maintained over time. Floors ceilings and walls are all equally dirty. The room rates are stratospheric for the quality of the hotel. The restaurant features truculent staff, high prices, and mediocre food. The alleged concierge staff were utterly clueless. Try the Hyatt Regency not too far away if you like this chain."
220,2101,"Oct 9 2005	In desperate need of renovation	DIRTY CARPETS! Filthy carpets. Disgusting carpets. I can't describe how dirty they are in the corridors, and even worse in the rooms. Worn out furniture, mould on the bathroom countertop, dirty wallpaper and a general lack of thorough cleaning on doors, vanities, and furniture. Did I mention dirty carpets? We actually put the duvet covers on the floor to walk on them.I called the front desk to ask for a new room. They told me that a room would be ready the next morning and offered to move my stuff for me. I had my wife and 2 kids with me, and the move would be a bit of a pain a day later(plus I got a glimpse into the rooms beign cleaned on my floor - same condition - same nasty carpets). THe front desk clerk told me that on my next visit, things would be different because they were planning to update the rooms in November 2005. This property reminds me of a typical Hilton: outdated, worn out, and yes the rooms do smell musty.As for location, Fisherman's Wharf reminds me of Niagara Falls. You decide if that is a good or bad thing."
221,2101,"Sep 20 2005 	not Hyatt quality	A hotel chain's reputation is the primary method many travelers use to decide where to stay. I've always rated Hyatts above Holiday Inns, but after my experience at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf, I'm changing my mind.Checking in involved a long wait at the desk, followed by schelpping my bags to my room myself when it became obvious the bell staff was completely overwhelmed. (I had to do the same when checking out).Big city hotels love to nickle and dime you for every extra they can pad your bill with. If I stay at a Holiday Inn, I get free high-speed internet and free parking. At the Hyatt, T-Mobile wireless access was offered for $10/night and parking was $45/night. 3 of the hotel's 4 elevators don't stop at the lobby level, only the stair accessed lower level. Waiting for the one elevator that does stop at lobby level took up to 10 minutes.There's no real &quot;hotel restaurant&quot;, just a lobby level sports bar with more TVs than entree choices. Avoid at all costs, and find your food at any of the many nearby restaurants."
222,2101,"Sep 17 2005	Good base to explore	The hotel is in the ideal spot to explore the areas of San Francisco. The areas of North Beach and Chinatown are only about 10 mins walk away with excellent choice of restaurants. Union Square is a little further but best option is to use the cable car ($5 single) As previous comments - the hotel is clean, functional and tidy - we stayed in a double room which was big enough for two. There are no coffee facillities in the room, but is available free between 0630-0900 every morning. (Ours was in a set out area on the fourth floor around from our room)Didn't try Knuckles sport bar attached to hotel, but did try 'Cafe Pescatore' -one block away on the same road as the hotel. Excellent breakfasts and would recommend"
223,2101,Aug 30 2005	More like a Motel 6 than Hyatt	We were there for 9 nights. The hotel smelled musty the rooms where small.The shets would comeuntucked and end up in a bunch in the middle of the bed EVERY night (too Small?!!!)There was no concierge It was just not what I would expect from Hyatt
224,2101,Aug 30 2005	Good location.The hotel does the job.	My family and I have just returned from a holiday to San Francisco. I was a bit worried about staying at this hotel due to the previous reviews. The hotel is in an excellent location which is very quiet. It is very close to Fishermans Wharf and next to the cable car route. Yes the rooms are clean and nice without being outstanding and with no view but the hotel does the job. When in San Francisco you are out 99% of the time seeing the sights and eating out so the hotel is just a base.I would not have wanted to stay near Union Square. This is noisy and like any other city centre place. Also you would always have to travel further distances to get anywhere.
225,2101,"Aug 11 2005	OK hotel theres probably better.	We stayed here on the Forth of July after making a reservation with our Hyatt Points months in advance. I heard that the rate was up to $200+ for the night we stayed. We arrived way before the check in time but they had a room for us. When we first checked in for our non-smoking room, we were unpleased to find that the room they had given us was smelling of stale smoke. I went down and they changed our room to one without the smell of smoke. I didn't like the fact that getting to the elevator from our room seemed like a 5-minute walk through confusing corridors. The rooms are not all that big and ours had a view of the roof. We did check out and use the outdoor pool and whirlpool which was nice before we went to go see the fireworks. The fitness room was average but had a sauna which was a plus. The location is mostly up to your preference. We didn't find Fisherman's Warf to be all that great because it was mostly full of tourist traps and was a little creepy at night. The location is about 2-3 blocks in from the Warf. We stayed here on our last night in the city, but the other 2 nights were spent at the Hyatt Regency down at the Embarcado. We found this a less tacky, less crowded place to spend our time. If you do stay Fishermans Warf, check out the Argonaut Hotel or even the Best Western (dont knock it just because it's a BW, because it looked quite nice). If youve got any questions, dont hesitate to email me."
226,2101,"Jul 20 2005	Good location	We stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf from July 3rd thru July 5th. The location was great for all wharf activities such as Alacatraz, Pier 39, City Tour and the 4th of July Fireworks. We had a run in with the hotel personnel regarding our reservation request for a rollaway bed. When we checked in they said that they would send the rollaway right up. We waited for a bit and it did not arrive. My husband called and was now told that they could not put a rollaway in a room with 2 double beds. He told them that they accepted the reservation that way and that I had called to be sure and was told no problem. We were again told they would send it up. We went out for several hours and when we returned the rollaway was still not there. My husband, now angry called and spoke to the manager and after a bit of an argument they finally sent one up. The hotel also only offers valet parking at $32 per day so be weary of that. We never used the car while in San Francisco but needed it for the remainder of our California adventure. The pool and hot tub area is very windy and cool so bring a parka to put on when you get out."
227,2101,Jul 12 2005	Loved this hotel!	Thought this hotel was the perfect location for visiting the wharf. The staff were friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean with the most comfortable beds! The bathroom was roomy and clean and the pool was great!
228,2101,"Jun 28 2005	loved the hyatt---close to everything	just got back from the hyatt at fisherman's wharf---we were there for 3 nights &amp; 4 days---a very nice hotel--thought the room was plenty big--the service was excellent---didn't eat at &quot;knuckles&quot; restaurant, heard negative reviews, and was way too pricy!!!---the main downside of the hotel was no coffee in the room--you have to go to another floor for coffee--and while the bathroom is really big, there is no separate vanity outside of the bathroom-----walking distance to just about everything---and the little cafe(hollywood cafe) right across the street had excellent breakfast (very fresh squeezed orange juice)--excellent food and very nice service. the hyatt also provides a free newspaper every day, which was nice!!---but we couldn't find any brochures of things to do in the lobby, which was unusual-----all in all, we had a fabulous 4 days!!"
229,2101,"Jun 28 2005	Disappointing property - NOT 4*	Location is good if you're a &quot;walker&quot;. Meaning you could wake in the mornings, or walk after dinner, and walk out to Pier 39 or to Ghiradelli Square. But the property itself? Disappointing. The hotel is understaffed; the rooms are old and small ( I was supposed to have a pool view - wound up looking out at the roof over the restaurant); the valet &quot;service&quot; (?) was very slow; and worst of all was that the concierge service is severely lacking! (slow and VERY limited hours). The concierge leaves at 5pm (just when you're starting to think about dinner), and the front desk's idea of giving me a restaurant recommendation was to hand me the San Francisco Zagat's! Not what I expected of the Hyatt name -- the reason I booked this property. I would not recommend this property and I personally won't stay here again."
230,2101,"Jun 23 2005	Great Service but definetly NOT 4-Star	The Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf is not a bad place to stay. The pictures that I saw on the website and the room we got were quite different. When we first arrived, they checked us into a smoking room. I specifically requested *non-smoking* room. We called up the front desk and they gladly put us into a non-smoking room. The room was tiny and did not in any way resemble a 4-star hotel. I've stayed in 2-star hotels that were nicer than this. The room seemed somewhat gloomy and depressing. Another thing, valet parking was $35 per night, this is not mentioned anywhere on the website.However, there were some really good things about this hotel: it was only 3 blocks from pier 39, the service was *really* fantastic. Overall: Its an 2-star hotel with a 4-star name and 4-star price."
231,2101,"Jun 12 2005 	Great Location	I don't care what anyone else says - I really liked this hotel! My partner and I found it clean and the staff were friendly and very nice. We really liked the location. Some people think the whole fisherman's wharf area is tasteless and tacky - it is, but that's what we come for. Complaining about the food is a waste of time since we only had to walk two blocks to some great italian and seafood restaurants. We never felt unsafe on the street at night either. It was also a great location as it was a short walk to either the cable car or the trolley to go anywhere else in town (even though we did walk just about all over the city) We stayed 6 nights - admittedly 3 of those nights were paid for by work as we were there for a conference, but we thought the price was ok. The food at the conference was spectacular by the way. In all, I would go back there in a second - I loved it."
232,2101,"May 18 2005	I Don't Understand Everyone's Complaints.......I loved it!!	I just returned from a stay at this Hyatt. I am from Evansville, IN. My sister and I stayed for six nights May 10th-16th. We thought the rooms were exceptionally clean and very roomy. We stayed in Room 244 (double/double). I definitely encourage anyone going to San Francisco to get out and see the city and eat at the local restaurants at Fisherman's Wharf..Knuckles wasn't anything to do cartwheels over. We were pleased with the attentiveness and friendliness of the hotel staff! The gentlemen working valet were exceptionally quick and very friendly.The only drawback to the room was the air conditioning. I wasn't comfortable sleeping with the window open and the a/c never cooled below 72 degrees. I didn't complain about the issue though so the hotel was aware...perhaps it was just our room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to the San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf area. It is centrally located to just about everything that you would want to see."
233,2101,"May 18 2005	Good value great location!	This hotel is great for seeing the sights in San Francisco. It is just a couple of blocks from the Wharf and within a short walk of two cable car routes. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and the service is traditional Hyatt: very friendly and EVERY member of the staff ready and willing to help.If you drive, parking is cheaper than downtown hotels, and it's a lot easier to get in and out of the city."
234,2101,"May 16 2005	OK...	Spent 8 nights at the hotel for our Wedding Anniversary last week. The Major positive was the location, as it's close to everything the city has to offer. We had an inside pool view that was small in size, but mostly quiet. Oddly, the hotel promotes Starbucks as their Coffee Brand, but the Complimentary Coffee provided every morning is DEFINITELY not. Althought it is served in Coffee Urns with the Starbucks Logo on the pour spigots?!?!?!The Valet/Bellservice was very prompt and accommodating, the Front Desk and Concierege Service was average at best. Even basic directions seemed to stump the PM Desk Clerk. (however they did smile and greet guests warmly on most of our comings and goings.)My biggest warning would be the restaurant, Knuckles. WOW what a pitiful excuse for a Hotel F&amp;B Outlet! There was never a Host at the door to seat patrons, food servers had to notice a new table that needed service (which rarely happened) and the food was mediocore at best. We finally stopped using the facility after walking out on the 4th time we tried to have breakfast. No one will allow you to order off the menu since they pour coffee and walk away. The Buffet is your only option according to the Service Staff by their actions. As East Coaters, we were up by 7 am everyday, and they just couldn't accommodate guests/get it together that early. There was never a HOST or MANAGER in the Restaurant during any of our visits. I guess Hyatt is OK with Auto piloted restaurants. At an average 2 person breakfast at over $30, this doesn't fly with us.If I had it to do over again, I would have paid $20 more per night and stayed at the Marriott 2 blocks down. We had a few meals there, it it seemed much more &quot;managed&quot; than the Hyatt.Just thought any traveler considering a vacation on the Wharf should know... Happy Travels :-)If it helps, we are a DINK couple in our Mid 30's..."
235,2101,"Feb 15 2005 	Don't Stay Here	I stayed here in Feburary while traveling on business. It was awful. Very dirty.Staff tried but not much you can do when the rooms are run down and dirty. In my opinion, this property gives Hyatt a bad name."
236,2101,"Jan 18 2005	very disappointing	Stayed here in August 2004. We were very disappointed. The rooms, although quite reasonably priced, were very basic and nothing special at all. It is in a good situation if you want to visit Fisherman's Wharf but that, itself, we found tacky in the extreme. We also suffered a fire alarm alert in the middle of the night complete with an evacuation of the hotel to find out that a member of staff had set if off by &quot;cooking too much bacon&quot;! This fact relayed to a lift full of disgruntled guests by the culprit herself in a very cheery and not at all guilty fashion! On reflection I would suggest that people pay that little bit extra and stay near Union Square. You can get to Fisherman's Wharf easily on the trams but it's not really a place you want to dwell on. Don't miss the tour of Alcatraz though - it's brilliant!"
237,2101,"Jan 1 2005	Good location and Service	We stayed over Xmas week. Got a good deal with AAA discount  including daily free breakfast for two and -off kids. For us, the hotel was in a good location. If you dont want to be near the tourist stuff, then find another place. It was far enough from the main Wharf area ( I would not recommend staying on the wharf directly  very noisy), but close enough to walk. Also close to cable cars and local buses. Dont plan on parking a car there though - $34/night. You really dont need a car for anything in SF, as the public transportation is very good. There is no free internet service, which was a bit disappointing. Our room was a bit of a hike from the elevator, but it was *very* quiet  facing the inside of the hotel. The staff was very courteous and helpful.The rooms are not huge, but OK for two people. I would stay there again."
238,2101,"Dec 23 2004	OK	The restaurant, Knuckles, was great. Except for that? Ugh. Room was nothing special. Took forever to follow the maze of halls to find my room, which overlooked a gas station. Really not that great of a place."
239,2101,"Dec 10 2004	Stay away from the street	My sister and I stayed in this hotel for two nights. Unfortunately is was during a protest outside the Holiday Inn across the road - but the 6am til 11pm mega phone brigade could be heard loud and clear from our street facing room 7 stories up. However, the hotel is within walking distance of Pier 39, Ghiradelli Centre and the Cannery but we always returned to the hotel before dark because the streets were full of unsavory characters. THe room was lovely, what we expected for the Hyatt hotel and Hyatt price tag."
240,2101,"Dec 8 2004	Not worth the price...	I selected this hotel for the big name Hyatt but I am very disappointed with the 3 days stay. The room is small and hard to move about, even for just two persons. We were at first given a room so far away from the lift, making many turns like a maze. Only after our humble request, we then given a room just next to the lift, it was available in the first place. The bath room lack of many standart stuff, so you must bring along with your shower cap. I wish for a bigger room and free use of internet, you have to pay for $10 per day for wifi usage (still with some problem sending email). I will personally feels that this is not a good place to stay, price is higher for this big name but you are getting much different."
241,2101,"Nov 15 2004	So So	My new hubby and I stayed here on our Honeymoon. The staff was informed ahead of time that we were celebrating this special occasion in their hotel, yet they gave us a room with 2 double beds instead of the requested King. They didn't make much of an effort to correct the problem; said they 'might' be able to move us to another room the next day. The rooms were in dire need of an overhaul; not what we expected from a Hyatt. But the Concierge was very helpful and the location was convenient to the Fisherman's Wharf area."
242,2101,"Sep 22 2004	Great location nice hotel	We stayed here for four nights during our honeymoon. The people at the front desk were so nice to us, and congratulated us numerous times on getting married! The room was very nice. It was on the smaller side, but we spent most of our day seeing the city so it didn't bother us. The room was kept clean, the bed was comfortable, and the hotel was quiet.The front desk staff were great. They gave us tips on what to see and do. We got a great price on this hotel through priceline ($60/night) and we were treated just like everyone else. I was very pleased and would stay here again. You're close enough to the Wharf to see everything, but it's easy to get to anywhere in the city from the Hyatt's location."
243,2101,Sep 4 2004	Good location nice room helpful staff.
244,2101,Aug 4 2004	OK hotel tacky area
245,2101,Jun 30 2004	Good hotel

1,2103,"Charming and relaxed.	Had a wonderful stay at the Inn at the Opera! Located across from City Hall and a nice walk to Union Square. The decor was charming and quaint, yet updated and classy. Service was excellent."
2,2103,"Charming and lovely!	A charming and lovely hotel, with a few minor glitches. First, my room proved to be rather noisy: I was awakened nearly every morning as my neighbors showered! I couldn't believe how loud the sound of water in the pipes was!!!!! The real problem, though was an inattentive concierge, who spent more time on what sounded like very personal calls before looking up to see people waiting for things she could have helped with."
3,2103,"LOVE the Inn at the Opera!	We recently spent a few nights at the perfectly situated Inn At The Opera in San Francisco. It is a small hotel right across the street from the stage door at the gorgeous San Francisco Opera. Just a short walk from wonderful restaurants and shops, is is a great location to stay in San Francisco. We rented a car this time, determined to figure out the driving, and being right in the Civic Center made it so easy to get around. Tiny lobby, big hearted staff, we loved the guy who parked our car and took care of us, the delightful concierge who printed out a huge list of vintage shops for me and the woman who made up for the tiny rooms we too big people complained about... We are looking for our next trip there, to catch the music, the vitality and most of all, the joy of Inn At the Opera. It was fun...and we are two older, somewhat handicapped seasoned travelers."
4,2103,"Had a great stay	The staff was very friendly and accomadating. The hotel is a bit worn but very clean and charming. Rooms are a bit small, but adequit. The location is outstanding if you are in San Francisco for a performance or in Hays Valley for other reasons."
5,2103,"Nov 19 2009 	Thank You!	The email we sent (today) to Javier Hernandez, the Inn at the Opera's manager, regarding our recent visit:Good Morning Javier,We just completed a 9 day stay at your property (room 77) and want to express our thanks and gratitude for the wonderful customer service from your staff. When we arrived on Saturday, Nov 7, the Ballet room that Romeo had confirmed us in was not yet available so we had room 28 for the night. The next day we were relocated to room 77 and, while we were out, all our belongings were moved up to that room. We want to say an extra special thank you to Betty from Housekeeping. She was wonderful on Saturday &amp; Sunday when we arrived and transitioned to our new room. Throughout our stay she would always stop by and say hello while we were having breakfast. You are fortunate to have such a friendly and helpful person on your staff. The front desk staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome and always addressed us by name, adding a very personal touch.It is rare these days to experience such consistent customer service and obviously Inn at the Opera is getting it right!Thank you!"
6,2103,Nov 8 2009 	great hotel	The service was excellent at this hotel: staff very helpful and extremely friendly. Room was a bit on the smaller side but considering the location and the very reasonable price for downtown it was completely acceptable! Breakfast buffet included fresh fruit and good &quot;continental&quot; assortment.
7,2103,"Oct 26 2009 	Missed the mark on every count	This is the third time we have stayed at the Inn at the Opera. Each time reservation was made on their website with a follow-up phone call to verify because the process is not easy and confirmation is often not forthcoming. This time, for a ten day stay I reserved an Opera Suite (their largest), I called (in June for an October stay) and was assured the reservation was in place. Upon arrival, the only room available was the smallest one! Bummer to be in a tiny room for 10 days!! Then we noticed the room was not being cleaned well. We were informed that our rate only included making the bed (not cleaning the bathroom?). Right, not cleaning the bathroom or anything else for that matter! There were no such notations on the website, nor did I particularly ask for a discounted or limited service rate. We are very disappointed and won't be coming back!!"
8,2103,"Aug 19 2009 	They know how to take the reservation they just do not know how to hold it	I reserved a 3 room 498 square feet suite through Orbitz.I was offered a 2 room 292 square feet suite. The suite was too small for our family of four and we did not check-in. The staff of the Inn at the Opera told us that the smaller suite is almost as good as the one we reserved. They did not apologize and blamed Orbitz/overbooking for the error. They said that I should call Orbitz (they did not have the number, I did not have it either). They did not help me search for another hotel and they promised to charge a cancellation fee.I sat in the lobby of the Inn at the Opera and searched for another hotel. I found another place, put my kids and the the luggage in the car and drove away."
9,2103,"Aug 15 2009 	Inn At the Opera is our newest favorite getaway!	Some of the friendliest hotel staff will be found here! We've stayed twice and have truly enjoyed both stays. Breakfast was always plentiful and again, service always with a smile. I suggest parking the car in the valet lot &amp; walk or use rapid transit in the city. The location is perfect for seeing the beautiful city hall (pretty much just across the street) as well as the War Memorial Auditorium &amp; Opera House. Inn at the Opera is an easy walking distance from the Asian Art Museum (great Samurai exhibit along with an entire day's worth of other artifacts), United Nations building (neat fountain), nice little park with playground area for kids (adults must be accompanied by a child to enter!), and easy access to trolley, bus, or cable cars. We'll definitely be back!"
10,2103,"Jul 28 2009 	Quaint Elegance combined w/ personal service healthy breakfast apples cookies 	We stay at &quot;The Inn at the Opera&quot; every time we go to San Francisco. The staff knows us by name but they give personal name recognition &amp; attentive service to everyone - they bend over backwards to make sure your stay is relaxing &amp; worry-free. On our last stay we arrived @ 9am w/ our friends after taking the red-eye from Hawaii - the staff was so accommodating in letting us eat breakfast while they rushed to get a room ready for early check-in! Then when we were departing for a 6am flight &amp; the limousine service didn't arrive as scheduled, the staff managed to find &amp; call the driver at home, clarified that he was suppose to be here @ 4am not 4pm (schedule mix-up) &amp; able to get everyone to the airport on time! We love going to San Francisco because we love staying here!"
11,2103,"Jul 23 2009 	Four Fabulous Days in San Francisco	Inn At The Opera is a lovely hotel with caring ,efficient staff members, a wonderful restaurant, and an amazing location! The Symphony Hall is close by as are many shops and restaurants. The classical music playing, the lovely decor and the happy atmosphere made this one of my favorite places! I have traveled all over the world (mostly on a limited budget) and this is one hotel I really want to return to again and again! Some places just have a special magic about them and this is one!"
12,2103,"Jun 30 2009 	Inn at the Opera Desperately Needs Renovation	We've stayed here several times, mainly because the Inn is a two minute walk from the opera house. The staff are wonderful; they try hard to make this place work, but the last time we were there- this past weekend, when we saw three operas in three days-- will be the last time until something is done to upgrade the place. We had one of the suites, which are very hard to get, requiring a reservation many months in advance. The room was spacious, and the bathroom was nearly as large as our own at home. However, the bath water was barely warm (at best) all weekend, and the bathroom, despite its large space, is very poorly planned, with (for example) no counter on which to put your toilet kit, which has to sit on the floor. You'd have to see this arrangement to believe it. Providing a cabinet in this big space wouldn't be a big deal. The Inn also has no AC in the rooms, which is not normally a problem in San Francisco, but this happened to be three of those rare days when the temperature stays warm all night. We got very little sleep as the sirens and horn blasts went by our open windows on the fifth floor, lasting until day break and beyond. The worst is the bed was infested with bedbugs, and my wife came home decorated with, by last count, six very angry-looking bites. Pity. We've really like this funky old place, but the contrast with a modern hotel (our last night in town we gave up and moved to the Donatello-- another member of this chain) is striking. Come on, Shell, spend some money and fix up this old sweetheart of a hotel. It's worth saving."
13,2103,"Jun 29 2009 	Great Stay except for Van broken in	Recently stayed here from 6/22-6/26. Staff is excellent, accomodations clean and adequate , daily breakfast filling and everything was excellent unti 4th day when we were about to leave for a tour when we found our van broken in. Prevous night my hubby decide to park van along McAllister (across City Hall) and left GPS stand in the van. A bum/thief smashed front passenger's window and stole stuff in our van. Hubby spent $300 to fix window and we lost a day of touring as we need the van to get around and waited for it to get fixed. Hotel staff said that more incidents like this are happening lately."
14,2103,"Jun 21 2009 	Great location for the Opera!	We've stayed at this hotel before &amp; it is very convenient for the opera. It's about 1 1/2 miles from Union Square. It is an older hotel, more like a residence. The rooms can be small, but the suites are roomy &amp; good value for the money. Only 1 small elevator for the 7 floors. The rooms could do with lighter color decor, but I think they are working on some upgrades, as some rooms have new flat screen TVs. No airconditioning in the rooms, only fans, but this is usually not a problem in San Francisco's cool climate even in summer. Great restaurant on the fine dining side. Complimentary Continental Breakfast."
15,2103,"Jun 1 2009 	The location can't be beat for this part of the city.	If you want to be away from the city center, have business at city hall or are going to an event at one of the theaters or auditoriums near by, this is certainly the hotel to pick. We stayed in one of the suites that I believe is called an Opera Room. It had two full baths and is a perfect accomodation for three persons. It felt very roomy and was designed for maximum privacy. The elevator is small (4 persons) and very slow, so if you're on one of the upper floors be prepared to wait. The room does not have a safe. I was originally going to write that the room was a little tired and needed a makeover but looking closer I saw that it had recently had one and it was just the color scheme that made it look that way. There were two TV's but they were just 19&quot; CRT's and the one in the bedroom didn't swivel far enough to make it fully face the head of the bed. Heating is by two oil filled radiators on wheels like the kind one can buy at Home Depot. While the room was generally quiet I could plainly hear the shower on the upper floor. About 50% of the time the toilet next to the bedroom wouldn't fill after a flush and I had to remove the tank top and get it unstuck. Also, I noticed that the pipes to the sink and toilet still had the tags on them from the hardware store. I like to see a little more attention to detail than this. The price was certainly reasonable for the room size. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was very adequate and filling."
16,2103,"May 27 2009 	Great Stay- Great Staff	I was a guest at the Inn May 22-26, 2009. It was more than I had hoped for. The staff is very attentive, friendly and accommodating and was able to answer all my questions, including personal opinions. This is an older hotel so keep in mind, the elevator is small for more than 2 people with luggage, especially we claustrophobic ones. The running water can be loud at times, but it is always hot and good pressure. The courtesy apples and cookies are a welcoming treat when returning from long days out and about. I was cautioned about walking alone in the area, but I always felt safe and took advantage of the local buses rather than taxis to get around. The restaurant Ovations is FABULOUS. Lillian was hostess, bartender, waiter, cashier, and I wouldn't be surprised if she helped wash the dishes. All with a smile and the best service. Jin at the front desk helped me numerous times, as well as the other FD staff and bell staff, who unfortunately I did not remember their names. The Concierges are eager to have you attend the &quot;owners update&quot;, but a simple no and the conversation is over. Close to City Hall, the opera houses, fine and casual dining, easy access to Union Square and down to the bayshore, and so much more. If you seek a quaint hotel with excellent services, please take the opportunity to check out the Inn at the Opera. I'll be returning."
17,2103,"May 14 2009 	What a Wonderful Experience!	I booked a last minute trip to San Francisco this weekend and decided to try http://Hotwire.com for a good deal on a room. What I got was a GREAT deal on a FANTASTIC room at the Inn at the Opera. Then I Yelped it for results as you never know exactly what you're going to get when you do a Hotwire booking . I trust the reviews on this site over those of the booking site any day. Larry, Ed to the M and Gourmet were right on target with thier ratings - the Inn at the Opera pretty much rocks.Easy to find (for someone with limited knowledge of San Francisco) the Inn is located in a nice safe, very clean area. You can even avoid the overnight parking fee if the Parking Karmaforce is with you and you happen to score one of the street parking slots. It's located within steps of the stunning Opera house (I'm not even a fan of Opera - but the building is an architectural glory). The Inn itself is beautifully appointed, the staff was exceptionally prompt, curteous &amp; very sincere. One of the things I appreciated most was the fact that they didn't look down their noses at me for being a &quot;Pre Pay&quot; and showing up in hoodie and baseball cap direct from my tow-in surf session (as some staffers at other properties have when I've stayed in the Nob Hill section of SF). My room, though small, was very well appointed and comfy. In fact, I slept too well, I snoozed right through the free breakfast on Sunday (I should have asked what sort of mattress' they use as my bed was heavenly ) About the only suggestion I could make for the room was some sort of bed tray for working on my laptop as there was no desk space. But the wireless worked well, there was a mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, a plush terry robe, lots of hot water (love my super long hot showers) and plenty of fresh white towels. This property would make for a sweet romantic weekend getaway, a nice place to stay on business, or, as in my case, a great place to call home when mixing business with pleasure - not sure how well it would work for families though due to space constrictions.I will definitely be booking back at the Inn at the Opera for my futurestays - even if I can't score the 50% discount by booking online through Hotwire (59 bucks per night - down from $120.00+) ."
18,2103,"May 13 2009 	Definitely not my favorite	I booked this room through Hotwire, and will avoid picking this part of town again (Hayes Valley/Civic Center) in an effort to avoid this hotel. I am a frequent traveler to San Francisco, and understand the concept of small rooms here, whether they market it as &quot;boutique hotel&quot; or &quot;european style&quot;. I can honestly say this is the smallest room I have ever stayed in. My view of the fire escape doesn't help. Total claustrophobic hotel, with poor service. Not a great location to walk to things to (except Civic Center and Opera House), and poor service in bar/restaurant. They seem to run on their own hours, with no consistency. Not sure how Hotwire rates it a 3.5 star hotel."
19,2103,"Apr 20 2009 	Exceptional Service	If you are thinking about coming to San Francisco consider the Inn at the Opera. The staff could not do enough to make my stay one I shall remember for a long time. Shiela, the concierge took care of any questions about tours, places to see, getting around town etc. while the front reception staff were always there to nurture and take care of any needs. Breakfast was more than just a continental with plenty of choices. Location of Inn at the Opera was great - in a safe neighborhood in the Civic Centre district but not hours away from the centre of town or Fisherman's Wharf. Best tour recommended is the Movie Tour. What a treat to learn about the 600 Hollywood films shot in San Francisco and learn about the city at the same time. Worth every penny. Only advice to Inn at the Opera is to get CNN on their TV system rather than that horrid Fox News channel. Providing free internet for guests in the lobby would also enhance the services provided. Had I known about the free internet services available in my room, I would have brought my laptop. Overall my experience at Inn at the Opera was exceptional. First class."
20,2103,"Apr 19 2009 	Worse suite experience in a ""resort"" by Shell Hospitality despite good location	As I was searching a hotel to stay for a weekend visit back to San Francisco, I came cross to this hotel which is managed by Shell Hospitality and considered as a &quot;resort&quot; in the company's standard. It is an all suite property right off Civic Center, War Memorial Opera House and Symphony Hall in the posh Hayes Valley area. Welcome area and lounge area are decorated in classic tone and completely charming boutique feel from the beginning of the boutique hotel booms in the industry. The first staff I encountered at Front Desk was not uniformed when I arrived at a quarter past 1PM (a bit early for check-in but it was Sunday and the city is running lower occupancy in hotel industry, so I thought I could give it a try). Of course, the room/suite was not ready. I stored my belongings with the hotel and off my errands in the city. I was told that the room would be ready by 3PM. I returned to the hotel around 3:30PM and was given room 35 after 10 minutes wait by the Front Desk to get someone to acknowledge me. I got the key within one minute and off I went to the classic SF apartment cozy elevator. As I got off the elevator, I almost hit the robe (not sure if it is clean or not), hanging by the door that enters to the wing my room located. I carefully walk around it in the Hotels narrow hallway. It indeed reminds me a bit like many of the city sponsored apartment buildings around SF, except the price tag for this hotel was way much higher. As I walked past an opened door with housekeeper inside to get to my room, I knew that my room would not be ready (this came from my experience working in Sales &amp; Marketing department in a two major hotel chains in US for 10 years). The bed was not done and the room had a really bad odor. I turned around and went back to the Front Desk. This time, I was noticed right away. I informed the staff that the room given to me was not ready. They radioed the housekeeping department and I was told that the room was ready after they got the confirmation from housekeeping. I told the FD staff that the bed was not made so it could not possibly be clean and ready. One of the FD staff went into the office behind the desk and later I was given another room - Room 55 on 5th floor. This time I did not encounter the dirty linen hanging from the door and did not notice any housekeepers on this floor. I got into the STUDIO and was really shocked. The kitchenette area was efficiently in front of the door. To the right, there was the bed that I would be crashed for the 2 nights. There was no working area or desk. The tiny night stand houses an old lamp, the house phone, standard hotel radio/alarm and a pile of magazines/hotel information directory (I gathered as I did not want to get more shocks with the 3.5 star hotel accommodations). The armoire right in front of the bed has a VCR-TV combo, few drawers and hangers. There was no safe deposit that could be found as most 2-5 star hotels would have across US. The iron and iron board are tugged away next to the armoire and the mirror wall (YES, the mirror wall that can be found in some road-side motels often with a big billboard offering honeymoon suite by the hour!) On the other side of the bed is a classic armed-chair sits between the window (going out to the fire escape) leaving a bit of room for me to walk by. The studio is really tiny comparing to most hotel rooms I have seen in San Francisco (one of the hotel chains I worked was in the city) but this room is to suppose to be a STUDIO and the hotel names itself as a 3.5 star resort. I was truly disappointed but I told myself to make do since I am only staying two nights. I tried to put away my suitcase and all my belongings since there was not much room to walk around in the bedroom area. The armoire cant be opened all the way and hit the end of the bed when opens to 60 degree so I carefully tugged my bag in the armoire as well as the portable heater it was left in my room.The bathroom was decent size comparing to my sleeping quarter but I would only consider it was efficient not luxurious or nicely decorated. It does appear to be clean and everything seems to all attached, however, the rose color shower curtain stands way out in this all ivory/creamy colored bathroom. I looked again in the hotels website and made sure that I was not making any mistakes on my research before booking the hotel. I found there is some rooms in the hotel SMALLER than mine, called Ballet Room for efficiency travelers (I however had hard-time to image any room smaller than mine). For my type of studio, it supposes to have two chairs and a desk or table according to the hotels website. I told myself that there is no way, the hotel can even try to put in another chair or a desk/table and still advertises this studio as comfortable for two people. I pulled over a pillow as my desk on the bed and sat on the one and only chair to make it work as working area. The resort/hotel is not deserved 3.5 star as I have seen 2.5 and 3 star hotel in the city that are more spacious, clean and well dcored. I dont know how the hotel pulled together to get the star rating from AAA and passed the standards as required. Shell Hospitality managed a few great resorts so I was really disappointed that this hotel can be part of Shells world of elegant resorts and vacation homes. The rate for the studio was low but I know that I can get some other hotels with less star rating but more comfortable setting for travelers. My back was getting stiff just to sit on the chair and work on the laptop for one hour, a business traveler definitely would not be able to use this property for the business trip."
21,2103,"Apr 6 2009 	booked 2 nights 3+ months in advance and was relocated by hotel at check-in!	A disappointing experience.I wish I could review the hotel. I chose this hotel primarily for it's location and amenities. I reserved on 12/31/08 for a 4/3-4/09 stay. I called 48 hours in advance to re-confirm and to let them know I would be checking in after 6:00 pm and had an 8:00 show to get to. I arrived at 7pm only to be told that someone &quot;overstayed&quot; and that I would have to stay elsewhere. I was sorely disappointed that I was unable to stay where I had planned (I had shows at the Orphuem 4 blocks away, and the Opera House, 1 block away) and had planned on WALKING with my 9 year old daughter from the hotel both nights. To the hotel's credit, I will say that the hotel put me up at their expense at a location about 8 blocks further away, uphill at a nice old place with friendly staff at The Majestic. I can recommend The Majestic, but not the Inn at the Opera, as they apparently cannot guarantee that you will be able to stay there, even with a guaranteed rate booked well in advance."
22,2103,"Apr 6 2009	Just Loved Staying at The Inn At The Opera	Found it to be like a very elegant small European hotel. Staff was wonderful and very accomadating. Ovations, the restaurant was beautiful and we had a delicious dinner."
23,2103,"Apr 2 2009 	Amazing Service	The ladies were so nice, they offered so much for us for our 4 night stay. It is really cramped but it had all that we asked for. They are very welcoming and offer any kind of service they felt we needed. We had one bed with three people, but they brought in an extra roll up bed and extra restroom supplies. There was complimentary breakfast but it was simply beagles, boiled eggs, and fruit that you served yourself."
24,2103,"Apr 1 2009 	Cozy but a bit small	Inn at the Opera is a quaint little place to stay with very friendly staff. We slept in a Juliet Room. The room smelled really good and it was neat and tidy. It felt really cozy and serene but it was much smaller than what we're used to. The bed was pretty awful. We never got comfortable and managed to smack each other a few times during the tossing and turning. That size bed would be suitable for one adult or two very small people but it was nowhere near big enough for two grown people. I woke up with a very sore back and neck. The complimentary breakfast was adequate. If you plan to arrive late, dont expect to get room service. According to the binder in our room, room service stops at 9:30. I was starving when we arrived but exhaustion won out. I would stay here again provided I got a larger room with a king sized bed. If the smaller rooms were the only ones available, I'd have to skip it unless I was by myself."
25,2103,"Mar 29 2009 	I will stay here again if I ever go back to SF	My husband and I stayed here for four nights from March 23rd - March 27th, 2009. We reserved the ballet room for 87.00 a night. I was really impressed with how much the hotel offers considering how cheap the hotel room was. The building itself is charming. A little old; but it just adds to the french charm! I loved the decor, too. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The blankets, pillows and bed were all very comfotable and easy to sleep on. The bathroom is also very nice, but there wasn't much space to store my cosmetics, so I ended up putting some of my stuff on the floor. For the most part it was quiet at night, except for early in the moring around 6:00, we could hear someone start a shower. The breakfast is great. Where I come from there is no way you can find such a great price on a good hotel; especially one that offers such a nice complimentary breakfast. The resturant downstairs called Ovation is soooo good. I highly reccomend trying the creme brulee. It's out-of-this-world! The service from the maids is great. However, I was dissapointed when we were told our room would be ready by 3:00pm but it was not ready until after 4:30. That had me quite upset because we were wasting precious time in SF. Also, the hotel is not located within walking distane to any attractions, so that made traveling kind of difficult. We rented cabs for the most part, and the hotel was very good about calling cabs for us. Overall, The Inn at the Opera is a great place to stay with good food and service at a great value. There were a few bumps, but the pleasure of staying here out-weighed any snags along the way. I would love to come back to SF, and I will reserve a room at The Inn at the Opera again. Next time though, I think I will get a bigger room. =)"
26,2103,"Mar 23 2009 	March 2009 Stay at Inn at the Opera	My wife and I just returned from a week's stay at the Inn at the Opera. A nice and charming hotel in a very well kept older building. Very clean. Agree with others that it is located a bit away from many of the attractions but the municipal transit system is pretty easy to figure out with bus and trolley stops within a few blocks. At first the room seemed small but we quickly got used to it and enjoyed it. We used the coffee maker a couple of times and kept bottled water and wine in the fridge. The continental breakfast was nice - bagels, English muffins, danish, cereal, fruit (bananas, watermelon, cantaloupe, honey dew melon), yogurt, coffee, tea, juice. It is served buffet style but the staff will fill your coffee cup. The hotel also puts out a bowl of fresh apples in the lobby every morning. They were really good. In general, the hotel staff was very accommodating, professional, and customer oriented. The only lapse we experienced occurred one evening around 10:00PM when some newly arrived guests opened our door. The front desk had mistakenly assigned them our room. A good reason to always use the chain lock when you are in the room. Judging from how well everything else was done during our stay this was obviously just one of those flukey things that happens now and then. We would definitely return to this charming hotel."
27,2103,"Mar 15 2009 	Exceptional value good location very nice hotel.	I needed a hotel for one night in a decent part of town, within a walking distance to the Civic center. Room was small but neat and offerred all you need...and more. It even had small microwave, fridge, coffeemaker, utencils, glasses and dishes for two. Cool! Free internet and if you don't have a laptop with you they have a PC in the lobby that you can use as long as want...again free. The service was impecable, the complimentary breakfast too. The concierge is there all day long with all the good info one can use. The best of all, the price was $97, including taxes. Location is also very good - small quiet street within a walking distance to many places. Try the restaurants and galleries on Hayes St (few blocks away). Awesome!!! I would highly recommend this gem to any single traveler or a couple for a short stay in SF."
28,2103,"Mar 7 2009 	Outstanding hotel with wonderful staff	We have stayed at The Inn at the Opera many times for many years and have found that it consistently has an attentive and thoughtful staff and fine accommodations. It is very well placed for those interested in the several cultural opportunities that are nearby, such as the Opera House, Davies Symphony Hall, Herbst Theatre, Civic Auditorium, the Asian Art Museum, the remarkable San Francisco Library, and the palatial City Hall. San Francisco is blest with copious mass transit which is effective for getting about without suffering the trials of a car in a major city. Also close at hand are trolleys to other museums, to downtown (which is not far), and BART trains going downtown and across the Bay to Berkeley, Oakland, etc. The facility is modest in size but is particularly exemplary for the wonderful staff that is most friendly and concerned, helpful and attentive to all their patrons needs. While the hotel is not large it has a charming intimate quality. The medium priced rooms are fully suited to our needs and we enjoy the parking provisions, the free fresh baked, warm cookies each afternoon, the omnipresent bowl of apples, as well as the free SF newspaper every morning etc. All of this gives an ambience of a concerned and caring place for our many trips to San Francisco."
29,2103,Feb 28 2009 	Wonderful experience	The hotel was perfect for our opera experience. Loved the room and extra touches throughout. The setting is perfect and walking distance to all the venues. We will be back! Thank you again
30,2103,"Feb 18 2009 	Charming Place to Stay and Wonderful Treatment by Staff	This was my first trip to San Francisco so I had no clue where to stay. After reading reviews about the Inn at the Opera, I decided to try it and have absolutely no regrets. At first, it seemed really small, but we quickly came to love the cozy, yet elegant and charming surroundings. From the first encounter with the desk staff to the last goodbye, we were treated with the utmost courtesy. Management and staff were absolutely the most friendly and helpful that I have met in my 30 years of traveling. I'm sorry that I don't remember everyone's names, but the two I can't forget are Julio and Betty. Every effort was made to ensure we had the best size room for our party of 3 adults &amp; a child. The room was a bit small the first night, so we inquired about something a big larger, not really expecting anything, but the next day, the manager moved us to a 3-room suite which was fantastic with 2 baths, and a kitchen. The European style of the hotel was a welcome change from the hotel chains that tend to look alike. The complimentary breakfast was delicious and beautifully presented. Fresh fruit was always available and a welcome treat. The manager graciously offered to hold our room for us while we visited Napa Valley and spent a night at the beach. The location of this hotel was a bit far from some of the sights we wanted to see, but really not a problem after becoming familiar with the streets, bus routes, etc. I felt very safe in the Theatre District even at night when walking to restaurants and nightspots. It is a very short and enjoyable walking distance to the beautiful Opera House and other historic buildings. I would stay here again without question."
31,2103,"Feb 7 2009 	Excellent Little Place	I stayed at this hotel for six nights having booked it via Hotwire for $59 per night. All I can say is, wow what a value!! The hotel itself has small but adequate rooms. My room also had a small wet bar with microwave, refridgerator and coffee maker. Each morning they serve a very good continetial breakfast in their nice restaurant. A moring newspaper is also complimentary. The breakfast alone is a huge money and time saver. The hotel was nicely decorated and seems updated. The staff was very friendly and quite helpful.It is not near the touristy Union Square area, but I found that to be more relaxing as it was very quiet without the constant siren and cable car noises. The Muni (subway) is about a five block walk and you can get anywhere from there. There are many very nice restaurants within a two blocks in the Hayes Valley area. Overall a great place to stay, unless you are traveling with younger kids, then it could be challenging if you are trying to do the tourist thing due to the location."
32,2103,"Jan 22 2009 	Excellent Service Nice Accomodations	My daughter and I stayed at Inn the Opera last night. We attended the 2009 SF Ballet Gala dinner and performance and did not want to drive back home to the East Bay and Peninsula. This is the second year we chose to stay at Inn at the Opera for this evening. In addition to the room being very clean and attractive, the service we received from the concierge, front desk and bell staff was all exceptional. It was an easy walk to the Opera House and City Hall. This morning we walked to the Asian Art Museum to catch the Afghanistan exhibit and after, we walked to Pacific Heights for lunch - about 16 city blocks down Van Ness and over on California to Fillmore to Delfina. I recommend Inn at the Opera highly."
33,2103,"Jan 4 2009 	Charming Hotel Great Service	We stayed at Inn at the Opera for 1 week. Location: very convenient; 1 bus ride to the wharf; 45 minutes to Napa Valley. Reception Staff: courteous, efficient &amp; friendly. Room: clean, comfortable, temperature is just right. Our key card did not work on the third day after we came back from Napa- the reception was quick to fix the problem. Free continental breakfast is filling although the waiter failed to fill our cup with coffee after asking us if we wanted some. We will stay there again in the future."
34,2103,"Dec 19 2008	Felt like family at Inn at the Opera	We consider Inn at the Opera our home in San Francisco. On our most recent stay the entire staff--front desk, concierge, bell, housekeeping and restaurant staffs were all exceptional in making us feel completely comfortable and taken care of despite a travel change resulting in our arriving a day too early without a reservation for that night. Nevertheless, the desk staff provided an available room for our first night and with the bell staff facilitated painless transfer to our reserved suite for our second and third nights. In a survey following an earlier visit, my wife had suggested that considering the number of older guests that bran flakes be added to the complimentary brunch. This time there were bran flakesa detail reflecting the level of this hotels customer service. We are very grateful to the entire staff for making our stay such a pleaure. In addition the Inn at the Opera is near the Civic Center including the City Hall with its rich history and elegant rotunda, the San Francisco Opera, Ballet, and Symphony, and the San Francisco Culinary Institute that serves to the public a Friday lunch buffet that is both reasonably priced and elegant. Located in San Franciscos Hayes Valley district, to the south and west are an abundance of neighborhood restaurants with a European flair, coffee shops, bars, boutiques, bookstores, and a sense of families and community. Block after block of level streets offer respite from Union Square and Nob Hill for the knee challenged amongst us."
35,2103,"Dec 19 2008 	Great Place	Excellent hotel to stay at. I stayed here for one night to visit the SF Ballet for the Nutcacker. I had heard some indifferent reviews, and had some concerns, but after getting there I loved this hotel. The area is not bad, as some people make it out to be, and the hotel is really nice. The rooms are really clean, and the beds are very comfy. The breakfast in the morning is so-so, but it is free, cannot complain about free food. The hotel really throws you back to the old days, makes you feel like your staying in an old victorian! I enjoyed it, you will too, Tim."
36,2103,"Dec 16 2008 	Room @ this Inn	took 2 days to adjust to the &quot;european style&quot; type of room (studio with refrig. &amp; micro),but thereafter was very cozy &amp; most adequate.adjusting to the small size of the room was challenging due to last years stay @ another svc property in s.f.(The Donetello) which for a studio was huge! my wife &amp; i highly recommend The Inn @ the Opera...the staff is professional &amp; friendly &amp; go out of their way to please &amp; serve...the daily complimentary continental b'fast is awesome...the onsite restaurant (Ovations) is pricey yet admirable in quality &amp; service."
37,2103,"Nov 29 2008 	Love the place and the staff	Usually we don't get great services from hotels in general. On this trip we drove from the vino bello in napa and stayed at the in at the opera. We never got such a good treatment from the staff. We remember Joseph and Rowena from the front desk and even Patricio the valet guy, they were amazing treating us as true costumer should always be treated. The hotel is great for what we were looking for( european style). Totally recommended ."
38,2103,"Nov 20 2008 	Great experience; Perfect location!	Although this isn't a true &quot;5-star&quot; establishment (but easily 4-star), we definitely had a &quot;5-star&quot; experience. This hotel has a very European, old-style feel to it, though it has been updated to ensure that guests are comfortable and everything was very clean. The staff was gracious and friendly, and although the valet parking was full, they directed us to parking right behind the hotel which actually saved us a couple of dollars. The location was perfect - practically next door to the Opera House and Civic Center, which made for a lovely evening stroll (though very short). We stayed in a Junior Suite which was very comfortable and many amenities were provided which are not always found in hotels (&quot;green&quot; shopping bags, dishes, etc.). The free continental breakfast was quite good and the restaurant was intimate and beautiful. We hope to arrive early enough next time to have dinner there before a show. We hope to return to this gem of a hotel many times in the future."
39,2103,"Nov 17 2008 	Excellent European-Style Hotel	Whereas our stay in October was marred by lapses in staff attentiveness, this time the service was very good. Brian at the Front Desk is especially professional and enthusiastic. The rooms are comfortable and well-appointed, and the hotel is excellently situated for patrons like us who are coming to attend the opera."
40,2103,"Nov 11 2008	Great Staff excellent continental breakfast	The staff were most helpfull from the moment we arrived from advising us on what to do and how to get there. Doors were opened and at the desk and in the hallways we were always cheerfully greeted and helped. The dining room provided a convenient continental breakfast served by a helpful and excellent staff. Dinners were excellent. We are older and appreciated the ability to split both salads and the main course. The facility reminded us of clean, older European hotels where we have stayed. The hotel was well located to use the Muni transportation systems. We enjoyed the opera next door and took advantage of the &quot;CITY PASS&quot; to see the sights and many attractions of San Francisco.Gordon &amp; Helen, Vancouver, BC, Canada"
41,2103,"Nov 10 2008 	Charming hotel great for operagoers	We love to stay at the Inn at the Opera when visiting San Francisco for the opera. The Opera House is right across the street, making it an ideal location, and the staff is always gracious and helpful. The room we had was small, but nicely furnished and included a fridge and microwave. We found the location very convenient to restaurants and other attractions too. The only negative was the live and recorded music from the downstairs restaurant, making it hard to fall asleep. We'll probably ask for a room on a higher floor next time."
42,2103,"Oct 22 2008 	Loved it	Three of us shared a full week in a 1-bedroom &quot;Symphony&quot; unit, booked through our timeshare company (this is a Shell resort as well as a regular hotel), and were really happy with the whole experience. An old-fashioned elevator operates among the hotel's 7 floors; a quiet, darkwood French restaurant offers fine (expensive) dinners, late-night drinks, and free &quot;Continental&quot; breakfasts that made us feel quite pampered.The room contained a semi-kitchen consisting of a microwave, refrigerator and sink. The bathroom was very large, while the living room and bedroom were more modest (but not cramped).The best part of the hotel, really, is the personal service. Our room was made up every day -- standard in a hotel, but not in timeshares -- and the desk staff greeted us pleasantly by name each day and helped us with all our bizarre questions.The opera and ballet are just across the street, and the entire area (Hayes Street) has become very upscale, with great restaurants and shops. We would certainly stay at Inn at the Opera again."
43,2103,"Oct 11 2008 	Staff was wonderful; Location was bad	The Inn was near the Civic Center part of the city. All the places we went were a 30 - 40 minute bus ride. When taking the bus tours, we were always the first picked up in the morning and last dropped off. An 11 hour tour for us lasted over 13 hours. We did tours with Tower Tours, Supersighting Tours and Grayline. They all dropped us off last. On the other hand, we got to know the staff well because of the size of the Inn. The staff was wonderful and would go the extra mile. One night, we wanted room service and the restaurant had closed the kitchen early (before 8:30 pm). The front desk staff intervened and got the restaurant to serve us room service. I would stay there again only because of the staff and great service but would plan on a lot of taxi service."
44,2103,"Oct 6 2008 	Scary Scary Neighborhood!	All in all the room was okay and the staff was very helpful and friendly. However, I was a woman traveling alone and had the inconvenience of having a male friend walk me to the hotel every night from the BART station which is over 3 blocks away. Also...the free breakfast is horrible and they make you feel like you have to leave a tip!"
45,2103,"Oct 3 2008 	Inn at the Opera Great	The Inn at the Opera is a wonderful hotel. It is small and has a family feeling. The rooms are very comfortable. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. An excellent breakfast is included. The location couldn' t be better for activities in Civic Center, such as performances at the Opera House ( just across the street, Davies Hall or Herbst Theater. Valet parking is available. I have stayed at the hotel many times and always look forward to returning there."
46,2103,Oct 3 2008	Excellent Customer Service	Keon Stewart and the rest of the Inn staff were gracious and extremely helpful. I'll be back.
47,2103,"Sep 24 2008 	Great Boutique Hotel	Take the time to do your homework on boutique hotels. I've stayed at several but the Inn at the Opera is a great hotel and I found special rates through the hotel website. If you want to be surrounded by crowds of tourists, then this hotel is not for you. It is away from the hustle and bustle of Union Square and the Wharf but these areas are accessible by cable car and other ground transportation. It is not as noisy as other hotels and you get a feel of the locals and the surrounding areas. The staff is very friendly and the rooms, although smaller than big chain hotels, are clean and comfortable. The complimentary continental breakfast was fine and complimentary cookies await you back from your city excursions! There's also a wonderful place to eat (for both vegetarians and meat eaters) at Max's a block from the hotel (a recommendation from Michael at the front desk). I would definately stay at this hotel again. Being away from all the busy landmarks, this allowed us to truly see the city and explore all the surrounding neighborhoods."
48,2103,"Sep 19 2008 	SUPERB SERVICE - very welcoming	A very well run and comfortable hotel right next to the opera house. Classical music-related decor and theme, clean and comfy rooms, but best is the warmth of the staff - front desk, housekeeping and breakfast room. Really felt we were staying with good friends who were spoiling us silly."
49,2103,"Sep 11 2008 	Amazing Boutique	This is a great boutique hotel with a great location if you plan on seeing the SF Ballet, Symphony or Opera. The staff here are absolutely amazing. Its small, so they have the time to chat with you and spend more time assisting with special requests than at a larger hotel. My room was great, the breakfast was enough to save me a few bucks each morning and overall I had a wonderful experience. I will return."
50,2103,"Sep 10 2008	My First Trip to SAN FRAN	This was my first time in San Francisco and my husband and I really enjoyed it. My husband had stayed at Inn at the Opera before on business, so it was a return visit for him.I was a little hesitant about staying here because of a few past reviews, but my husband had nothing but good things to say.The room was very cozy, and we ate at the restaurant once, it was delicous!We tried to book on the site Hotwire but were unable to find as low of rates as mentioned in a past reveiw. Plus your'e not garunteed the hotel you want ,so we went straight to the website and booked.We were happy with our stay and hope to return one day.The staff was great!We had some minor T.V. issues and the staff had it taken care of in five minutes."
51,2103,"Jun 6 2008 	Cute historic boutique hotel	I got an amazing deal on this hotel by booking through Hotwire. It was $52 per night plus tax, which came to $66.46. This is a terrific bargain for a 3.5 star hotel in SF. The location of this hotel was not ideal, for my needs, but it is close to Van Ness, a major thoroughfare with bus lines that can get you to where you need to go. My room was nice, not too small. I really had no complaints but would rate this as a 3 star hotel, not 3.5. If two people are sharing a room, quarters may be kind of cramped. However, if you are looking for a charming and unique place to stay, you will be happy with the Inn at the Opera. Especially if you can get a great price on Hotwire - it's in the Civic Center/Hayes Valley neighborhood for those who are familiar with how Hotwire works."
52,2103,"Mar 15 2008 	Excellent place to start	If your looking for luxory accomadations, or a big suite with magnificient views this is not the place for you. But if your looking for a nice comfertable place with friendly staff to kick off your visit to a great city then your in the right place. This hotel is only 3 blocks from the famous F street car line, which makes getting around a breeze. Also nearby is the ballet and the Asian Art museum which is a must see. As far as breakfast goes, it's exactly what you pay for. It's not nay worse then a continantal breakfast anywhere else, and there are plenty of places around if you want something more. The staff couldnt be more helpful and friendly, and the hotel decor very nice. I would definitly saty here again. One more little tip, the &quot;citypass&quot; is a very good investment, if for no other reason then the 7 day MUNI pass."
53,2103,"Feb 14 2008 	Great little hotel	My husband and I stayed here for part of our honeymoon (5 nights). We loved this little hotel! Yes, the rooms are a bit small and the bathroom was very small - but it was definitely enough room for the two of us. It does have a very European feel , which I absolutely loved. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. One of our favorite things was the fresh baked cookies they put out every afternoon. They also turn down your bed, put on a lamp and leave chocolates on your pillow. The complimentary breakfast was pretty good, I never saw anything wasn't fresh or spoiled. Although, as previous posters have stated, it is a little annoying that they seem to expect a tip for breakfast service, especially since it's 99% self-serve! We just tipped $1 for each of us each morning we ate there. We did eat breakfast at a restaurant on the last morning, but it cost us $30! One evening we ate at the restaurant and the food was delicious - some of the best French food I've had. We would recommend eating there if your budget allows (a little price, but worth it!). The concierge (John) was extremely helpful and very friendly, too. The location isgood, only 2 blocks from the subway and a short distance from several bus stops. We are already planning another trip to San Fran and would not hesitate to stay here again."
54,2103,"Jan 18 2008 	Quaint hotel but quite a few quirks	My husband &amp; I just returned last Saturday from celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary at the Inn @ The Opera. We were given a 2 bath deluxe room on the 7th floor...room was nice &amp; spacious but.....our 2nd night we found that none of the baseboard heaters worked! We reported this &amp; they brought 2 PORTABLE HEATERS to the room(this made us believe that this was a known problem to them). We thought we'll make do with this.Wrong. While ironing our clothes the electricity &quot;tripped&quot; in the room since apparently their system was obviously overloaded.We were left in the dark &amp; cold. We tried to make do &amp; reported this the next day. They came but did nothing &amp; basically left us with the portable heaters again. To make a long story short we tolerated this for FIVE NIGHTS &amp; then they offered to move us to a similar room when those residents left since they said it'll take a while to correct the problem.The move was good (to the 6th floor)but by this time I was personally fed up.While we were on the 6th floor, we heard residents in the room we vacated the same day &amp; which was right above us!Obviously they didn't fix anything, so as I said before, it seems that the problems are pre-existing &amp; they just don't fix it. For the nightly rate charged one should not have to tolerate this.Like one of the viewers said there's a &quot;tip&quot; bill folder for the &quot;complimentary breakfast&quot; which they presented with alacrity each day. This was a great annoyance to me.Additionally, the breakfast was boring(mostly produced from boxes &amp; packets) &amp; were cling-wrapped for each consecutive day .The breads were STALE...I even saw some mildew on the bread &amp; the CUT bananas were also recycled(one could see the browned edges).Our new rental car was dented &amp; badly scratched by their &quot;valet parking&quot; &amp; they pretended to not have any knowledge of how it was damaged...we had to complete a report with our rental car company....luckily we had full coverage on the car.Internet which is located in the lobby area (totally not private)was non-existent...forget about having any connection in your room.The staff are friendly but that doesn't compensate for the aggravation we had to go through.Don't think we'll stay there again."
55,2103,"Dec 31 2007	Not My First Choice	We were there for a week, had to cut it one day short because of family. First, you have to pay for internet service, never done that ever! I booked this trip six months in advanced with one of the best rooms in the place, the room was wonderful (get a suite if you are going to stay there, the other rooms are too small). Staff was wounderful, food at the Ovation was good but over priced, SF has such woundrful food go out and enjoy. Location is fine if you don't wander to far in to the Tenderloin, only blockes away. You need to go somewhere else to eat, if you realy want to experience SF. If it may be hot, there is no air in the rooms, but in SF you seldom need it but be prepaerd. There are so many great places to stay in SF I would not recommend this one."
56,2103,"Aug 24 2007	A wonderful place	This Inn is part of RCI and I got it through RCI. It is located in the Civic center section of San Francisco and a little out of the way. After two days, we got used to being out of the way (almost 1/2 mile to the cable car and Bart, but 2 blocks from the bus). The hotel included breakfast which was fantastic. There were always fresh chocholate chip cookies on the desk and fresh apples in a bowl. The place was clean and friendly. The concierge was very helpful and rented us a car during our stay for one day. The place picked us up in the morning and drove us to the rental place. Fresh towels and the bed were made every day. They even brough bottles of water to my room during the night. Great RCI experience."
57,2103,"Jan 9 2007 	Charming but . . .	This is the second time I've stayed here. Charming, wonderful European atmosphere. The staff is very friendly. You'll feel quite at home. And the price is certainly right for a centrally located quality hotel. Do NOT, however, expect more than charm and personality. The rooms are European, too, in that they are small and very spartan. There's no individual room climate control, so you get whatever heat/AC the hotel thinks is appropriate. (It's January at this writing and the room is too warm! Thank God the windows open.) The walls are thin and your neighboring room's plumbing is right next to the bed, so when someone next door showers in the morning, the noise is deafening. Don't try to sleep late. The Ovation restaurant? What bar doesn't have bourbon? Unbelievable! And the complimentary continental breakfast is poor even by European standards. Even two-star hotels in Italy where I've stayed had more diverse and interesting breakfast options. Finally, a concern about staff training. Yesterday there was a blackout in the neigbhorhood. When the power went out, the front-desk staff panicked. They didn't know what to do, whom to call. They stood at the front desk picking up the phones and wondering why they didn't work. And not all of the emergency or exit lights were working properly. Some of the hotel staff showed more control, suggesting calling the power company on cell phones, etc. They *all* should be trained in emergency response measures, no?"
58,2103,"Sep 30 2006 	Nice hotel but not for a time share exchange	We stayed at IATO Labor Day week. Loved the hotel, it's quiet, intimate and clean and is in a good location. We were in a &quot;junior suite&quot;, which was a bedroom and adjoining sitting room/kitchen (well, there was a sofa, small table, sink, microwave and mini-refrigerator). The virtual tour on their website is an accurate depiction of the room, but note that there is a mirrored wall that makes the junior suite look like it has two beds. We would stay here again, but not through a time share exchange - -since it's not a resort there were no on-site amenities that we usually experience with an exchange.The continental breakfast was OK for a day or so, but they never change the offering, so you'll become bored with it after a couple days. Go around the corner to Citizen Cake instead - - they have great coffee, breakfast and people-watching. We also went to the crepes place across the street from Citizen Cake...that was not as good."
59,2103,"Aug 25 2006 	Great find!!	Great value! Rooms are exceptionally small..enough for a bed and room to walk around it. (hard to get used to) However, if you keep it tidy &amp; are not in there all day it is suitable. Microwave in room, very neat &amp; excellent little 'kitchen' area with a small fridge, plates and even wine glasses...very chic!! Maids are VERY friendly do a good job and leave you chocolates behind when they are done...what a nice touch. Remember the hotel is a boutique hotel so it is old..slight musty smell in hallways but not gagging..you get used to it. Great renovations for a hotel this old. Rooms are CLEAN and updated. Front staff is excellent; complimentary breakfast is great at first but can be boring after a few days. Elevator was a surprise but very innovative..you will see. :) Waiters are courteous at first. A 'tab' folder is placed on your table after breakfast with a paper in it indicating a tip is suggested. When you are there for a few days you observe the waiters sense of anxiousness as they await to open the 'tab' folder. Some of the reactions from the waiters are unreal...&amp; then they talk to each other in their own language. Not a good feeling at all."
60,2103,"Jul 24 2006 	Charming but no a/c	What a charming hotel... we used to stay there many years ago (we travel for our business) and I had forgotten why we stopped when our agency booked it for us. As soon as I arrived, I remembered! No air conditioning... We stayed there in July 2006 and the rooms were so hot, we asked for a fan and it helped, but still, the rooms were constantly around 78 degrees!We love the hotel and the service, but don't got here in the summer!Another thing that surprised us this time was the room service menu. They only had one vegetarian item. Being a vegetarian, you quickly get bored with eating the same thing. Luckily there are many good restaurants nearby so it's not a big issue, but for a hotel this nice (except for the lack of a/c) they should have a better room service menu.I will go back, but in the winter..."
61,2103,"Jun 21 2006	Nice but very small rooms...	My husband and I traveled to The Inn at the Opera in mid-July. They had a very friendly, helpful staff, and it was conveniently located to most places that we wanted to go. The breakfast in the morning was pretty good, but being that we were there for a week, we got a little tired of it. They did not ever change their buffet menu, and it was already quite limited.The rooms were nice but most of them are very small. The beds barely fit in the room let alone giving you any walking space. If you are looking for a spacious place to stay, this may not be your best option.The hotel is clean for the most part, but we found a hair on our bed sheets and in our shower... which completely grossed me out.I really liked that they turned down our bed at night and left chocolates on our bed. This was a very nice added touch! One restaurant you must try... Scoma!!"
62,2103,"May 8 2006	Absolutely Delightful	We just spent the weekend at this hotel and it was charming. We were attending the ballet and chose this hotel for location-right around the corner from the venue. It's in Hayes District ,which houses many top restaurants and dessert/drink cafes. The area and it's architecture is very pretty-in the heart of the Culural Arts/Civic Center District. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Junior Suite-a very pleasant surprise. The room was lovely with many nice touches. We had a parking package and the valet service was great. There were cookies in the early everning that looked delicious but we were on our way to dinner. Service was great-very willing to please. The continental breakfast was in their lovery restaurant and was very good- Nice array of food and beverage choices. A find!"
63,2103,"Apr 12 2006	So very romantic great for honeymoon or 25th wedding anniversary!	My husband and I fell in love in San Francisco 25 years ago and wanted to stay in a great location in San Francisco for our 25th wedding anniversary. We stayed at the Inn at the Opera for the most relaxing, romantic week of our entire marriage! The staff treated us so special knowing about our anniversary. I want to return every year now!"
64,2103,"Mar 16 2006	Great service	My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a week via a time share exchanged. We were delighted with the hotel. The rooms are smaller than most people are used to but we found them very cozy and nicely furnished. I didn't find the bathrooms small. The breakfast we had was better than the usual continental breakfast. It has several kinds of cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, danish as well as hardboiled egg, pineable, watermelon and cantalope, banana and several kinds of juice as well as coffee. More than enough to start the day. Breakfast was in their lovely restaurant, Ovations. Room service was a real bargain and the food was from the Ovations kitchen so it was very good. The front desk acknowledged the rooms were small but they said they try to make up for it with fine service and I would say they did that excactly. Guests were invited to a wine and cheese party during the week so you could chat with fellow guests and meet the management. The hotel is in a very well lite area right across from the City Hall and near the Opera, Symphony and Ballet so there is always something going on and people around. The area in the direction of Market St is not the best but the other direction toward Gough has very nice restaurants and shops. Restaurants that were recommend were Citizen Cake and Indigo. We used a 7 day pass and used it a lot for cable cars, buses &amp; trolleys. YOu don't really need a car but the hotel has a garage if you need one. We took a Wine tour through a company called Supersightseeing and it was less crowded than a Gray Line tour that we ran into. Our tour guide (Steve) was wonderful and very knowledgeable. Good place to see on your own or walking tour is Pacific Heights with its Victorian homes and great views of the City. Stop at Union St. in Pacific Heights that has some great cafes and boutiques. We would definitely return to this hotel if we visit again."
65,2103,"Mar 4 2006	Nothing was too much trouble	The staff could not have been more helpful and courteous, Jose-Louis helped us no end and the other staff were most helpful and friendly. The Inn at The Opera is ideally located for walking and close to reliable public transport. Don't take the cable cars if you are in a hurry, the car operators certainly aren't!"
66,2103,"Feb 5 2006	Charming small hotel	My husband and I booked this hotel based on it's location and positive reviews. We stayed one night and attended the SF Ballet's &quot;Swan Lake&quot;. The ballet was beautiful and the hotel was only a short walk away. The staff is friendly but the rooms are extremely small. I would estimate about 200 sq feet. Our room on the 4th floor had a window that looked out to the alley but it was nice that we could open it for fresh air because it was unseasonably warm. The bed was comfortable but unfortunately we did not discover the ear plugs in the drawer of the nightstand until the next morning. We were awoken at 1:30am by an extremely loud garbage truck in the alley emptying the garbage bins and found it difficult to sleep due to the noise for most of the night. The bathroom was so small it was difficult to find space to put out toiletries but the shower did have adequate pressure. The complimentary breakfast in the morning is continental style, with very few choices. It is rather strange that the waiters hand out tip portfolios at breakfast, but since they were nice enough to refill our coffee cups for us we left them a few dollars. The parking package we booked via the internet was $142/night. Although the hotel was adequate, we felt the accommodations were simply too small to be comfortable. Next time we visit SF we will seek a hotel with larger rooms, even if the location is not as convenient. We enjoyed a nice dinner at the Hayes Street Grill but be sure to book advance reservations on performance nights because it gets very crowded. I would recommend any of the grilled fish, the french fries and of course the wondeful creme brulee! As with most restaurants in the area, it is expensive but the service was absolutely wonderful which is made it a lovely meal."
67,2103,"Nov 10 2005	Think small	How you perceive the inn will depend much, I think, on the package you can arrange on the hotel's own website. Having stayed at this property during ten different occasions, I hope to provide some insight.We almost always book a room with parking included. Since parking rates are now $25 a night plus 14% tax, you should do what you can to snare this arrangement. Since so many guests do not seem to mind the small rooms, there should be no problems unless you have large suitcases. Each room is equipped with a kitchenette (microwave, small fridge, enough utensils to reheat food)and two packets of coffee, which will be replaced at $1.75 each. This policy has been in force for four or five years. Yes, it should be replaced daily, for free.The service at the desk is very accommodating, and, if things don't work properly in the room, you can count on the help to fix things. Your room is likely to be assigned randomly, even if you request specific rooms. Often the inn is fully booked with performers and/or their guests and the management cannot always guarantee your requests. You should, however, ask to be in a room that is not adjacent to a room with jacuzzi tub, as the noise from the bath in the suite will make sleeping difficult. Street-side rooms have nice neighborhood views but can be noisy if you choose to leave your window(s) open. And since there is no air-conditioning, you will certainly need to do so during the occasional hot days.A complimentary continental breakfast is included(not too inspiring but there is fresh fruit and unlimited drinks), and yes, a folder is presented upon departure. For heaven's sakes, put in a dollar or two. Many other establishments do the same. We've eaten a couple of times at the opulent restaurant Ovation, located past the front desk. Although there is enough choice on the menu, prices have escalated seriously enough and service has grown indifferent at best, to the point where we can no longer recommend it. Try instead Absinthe, Jardinire, Hayes Street Grill, or, for the super budgeters, Stelline's."
68,2103,"Oct 9 2005	None better	My famliy stayed at the Inn on the 2nd and 3rd of Oct. When we pulled up to the curb my wife recieved a call that her mother(85)had been rushed to the hospital in Spokane, Washington and did not look good. This was at 10:00am Sunday morning. Not only did the hotel let us check in early, the staff looked into booking my wife on a plane to Spokane. As my mother in laws condition improved over the next few hours so we decided to stay. We were in room 64, a suite, that was absolutly delightful. A sitting/kitchen area, living room / 2nd bedroom, full size main bedroom, and two full size bathrooms. The staff was nothing but excellent in every instance and we WILL return for accomadations when we plan to vacation in the Bay area."
69,2103,"Oct 4 2005	Why so few reviews of this Hotel?	I can't understand why there are so few reviews of The Inn at the Opera. We, (2 couples), found it excellent. We booked through Expedia and got excellent rooms for about 55/$96.Some reviewers have said the rooms were small, but that is only by US motel standards, by Europen standards they were a good size.The staff were efficient, courteous and friendly, the rooms were spotless. and towels seemed to be changed as soon as you wetted them!Continental breakfast is extensive, delicious and best of all, complementary!OK, it isn't on Fisherman's Wharf, or Union Square, but that is reflected in the price, and many people (us included), regard that as a plus point, not a minus.You can walk to Market Street and the cable car in 15 mins, and a cab (between 4 people) was only $8 to anywhere in the centre, so you are not out in the back of beyond. Check out any other hotels in town at a similar price, and this has to be the one to choose - highly recommended."
70,2103,"Feb 8 2005	Old-fashioned attention	Great location, friendly and extremely courteous staff, reasonable prices. A little piece of European boutique hotel elegance in San Francisco. Near great shops and interesting eateries. Plan to stay there again next month (March 2005)."
71,2103,"Jan 24 2005	Petty	I must complain about an incident that occurred during our stay. First of all, I found the room we stayed in on January 18th and 19th cramped. There is barely any room to walk around the bed and the armoire door does not open fully to view the television. Otherwise, the staff is very well mannered and everything else was satisfactory except for this small incident.   I have to tell you this however petty it may sound as I find a charge of $3.50 unjust. My complaint is the coffee packets left in the room. There is a $1.75 charge for requests for extra coffee packets. I assumed this meant per day only to find (to my dismay) that I was charged $3.50 for requesting another decaf and caf packet the second day of our stay. I told the maid that she must have forgotten to put some more in the room and she could not even speak English very well. I assumed she made a mistake as I frequent hotels and they always give additional coffee packets free of charge each day when they clean the rooms. I did not know I would be charged until checkout. This petty charge really bothered me."
72,2103,"Oct 25 2004	Older Hotel with Nice Staff but Small Rooms	I stayed here one night in October 2004. I made my reservation on the hotel's website and got a room for $109 per night. Unfortunately, when I called from the airport to find out the hotel's cross-streets and confirm that my room was available, I learned that the hotel had erroneously made my reservation for 10 days later. The hotel told me that it was full but that it would find a room for me as the reservation mistake was its fault. When I arrived I found that the hotel itself is located essentially behind city hall, which puts it in walking distance of government buildings in the Civic Center. However, the street has no other businesses on it (it all appeared to be older apartment buildings with metal security gates), and at night it was dark so the walk to the few restaurants on Van Ness (California Pizza Kitchen, Chevy's, a noodle place, and McDonald's) did not seem like a good idea. The hotel itself is rather small. The lobby consists of a small sitting area and then the front desk. The elevator is an ancient contraption that claims to fit six persons. Classical music is played in the hotel, including in the elevator. I was assigned room 68 on the 6th floor overlooking the street. It was furnished with antique-looking furniture, including an amoire and a desk. It also had a sink, microwave and undercounter refrigerator. The bathroom was tiled, had a tub/shower combination, thick towels, and nicer toiletries. Everything in the room appeared to be generally tasteful and in good condition. Other than the fact that the hotel is older and noise travels through the walls just as it would in an older home, the only drawback to the room was its small size. There was literally about one foot of space between the end of the bed and the front of the amoire.The staff was very pleasant both at check-in and check-out.All in all, the Inn at the Opera is a small, kind of creaky hotel, with small, nicely furnished rooms, on a street that does not lend itself to walking at night, and has a very nice staff. I would stay there again."
73,2103,"Sep 9 2004	Perfect Accomodations!	I wanted to give my nieces and their moms (my sisters) a treat for their birthdays. I wanted to have nice accomodations so we could relax and at the same time be conveniently close to the bart stations and the theater. We had two rooms at the Inn at the Opera with each room having a separate bedroom with a double bed and the living room area making into another bed. The beds were very comfortable, each area was very roomy, and best of all we were treated to a breakfast which was brought to our rooms. The staff was the nicest you could ever meet and they helped us with maps, buses, taxis, and directions! We had an amazing weekend and I would go back in a second!"
74,2103,"Aug 23 2004	The IATO is a great place to stay	This Location is nicely appointed and comfortable. The staff are ever ready to assist you with whatever may be needed. I got a call from the manager who was offsite, regarding my connection to the internet in my room. The breakfast was very good. I have stayed at chain hotels that are more expensive and don't offer the ammenities that the IATO does. The Parking Package is a great deal. I will stay at the IATO whenever I am in SF."
75,2103,"Jun 16 2004	Nice Hotel Overal but ....	Overall the Inn at the Opera is a boutique hotel (nice, antique furnishings) but on the small side. However, beware of noise issues here. I heard plumbing from surrounding rooms (toilet flushes, water pressure through the pipes when running a shower/bath, etc.). The noise got quite audible on and off at odd hours. Still, when I got home at night, my room was a true oasis. Hope your room works out for you! Nice, quiet (non-Union Square) locale that is relaxing."
76,2103,"Jun 7 2004	A Great Location But . . .	The location is perfect for events at the opera house, symphony hall, etc.The hotel itself is not special. It is European (i.e., small rooms, small, slow elevator). The dining room could not accomodate us for dinner when we called a few days in advance. We called the front desk for a cab and had to wait a half hour, causing us to be late for our off-site dinner.When we (and others) returned from the opera (Saturday night at 10:30 p.m.), the restaurant and bar were closed. We all went elsewhere for drinks.The price, however ($99 - Orbitz), was right."
77,2103,"Apr 23 2004	Great if going to Opera Ballet Orpheum	Was going to see Lion King at the Orpheum Theater and spending the night. Looked at all the hotels along Market St. and found this one not on Market and by the Opera House. Wanted to be within walking distance of the Orpheum. It's a 10-15 minute walk to the theatre, you don't walk to the theater on Market, but use Hayes. This avoids the panhandlers (especially at night). Restaurant in the hotel was great, service was good and the room, though small, was quiet and comfortable."
78,2103,"Mar 8 2004	Excellent service in a great hotel	I was extremely pleased with the service and attention to detail of this hotel. The staff was very accomodating and pleasing to talk with. The complimentary continental breakfast was great, not to mention very convenient.We felt very safe while walking in the neighborhood and had no trouble finding a good restaurant within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again if and when I make my way back to San Francisco."
79,2103,"Feb 11 2004	Immaculate Hotel Safe Area	We were impressed with this two star hotel--the friendly and helpful staff, the pretty, clean (rather small) room, the fresh and complimentary breakfast, free daily newspaper (except Sunday --$1.50), fresh cookies every evening. The area (333 Fulton Street) is nice also. We attended the ballet which is practically next door and walked around the area feeling safe and secure (Hayes Street has great shops!)"
80,2103,"Feb 5 2004	Stylish friendly	I stayed in August 2001 and found the hotel beautifully appointed with a turn of the century European feel to it. The room was small but well appointed and situated beside the Opera, ballet and City Hall and not far from the business district. Breakfast was a lavish cold buffet, everything was superband included in the price. Drinks at the bar were expensive though. If I should be so lucky as to return to SF, I would want to stay again."
81,2103,"Oct 28 2003	What a gem - Inn at the Opea	Although the hotel is not close to the &quot;touristy&quot; attractions (i.e. Fisherman's Wharf, Ferry, etc.), it is an inexpensive cab ride away and is across from the Opera House and Ballet. It is right in the heart of a variety of restaurants and bars within walking distance. The hotel staff was superb - knowledgeable and accomodating. No request was a bother and could be accomplished. Warm cookies await you at the front desk each late afternoon after returning from the day's activities. The hotel is absolutely charming with tight but posh interiors. The rooms were European style so expect smaller quarters (i.e., armoire instead of a closet), but again they were clean and nicely decorated. The complimentary continental breakfast could not be beat. It was a great start to each day. We would stay at the Inn at the Opera again in a heartbeat!"
82,2103,"Aug 25 2003	Good choice	We enjoyed our week stay at the Inn. It has the charm and feel of a small euro-hotel. The staff is highly professional and attentive. Valet parking is prompt and secure. Rooms are well appointed and clean. The breakfast buffet is worth the money, and the dining room is cosy. The hotel is around the corner from many small, top-notch restaurants, the City Hall - Opera House complex, and Market St. We'll be back."
83,2103,Oct 29 2009 	Nous avons fait un excellent choix!
1,2107,"Great Union Square Location Exceptional Service	Very clean, great service and location. Close to the cable car turnabout and shops. Stay in the Studio suites if you are travelling with your family and the free breakfast promotion cannot be beat. The only negative is that there is not a &quot;private&quot; toilet room in the bathroom which is pretty standard when staying in a suite. Kids loved riding the glass elevators up to our 19th floor location."
2,2107,"Nov 19 2009 	Excellent quality everything you expect of a JW	Stayed here in September on a weekend away. Weekends in downtown San Francisco are curious - hordes of tourists from all over the world give downtown give a somewhat theme park feel to the city. The absence of locals detracts from the experience, but that being said, the JW Marriott is exceptionally well located right near Union Square, and not too far from the BART/MUNI on Market.I arrived to SFO, and walked to the JW from Powell Station. Don't let anyone tell you that you have to take a cab to/from SFO or Oakland airport. Unless you have industrial sized luggage, take BART from the airport.Arriving early in the morning, I tried for an early check-in, but the room wasn't ready. This isn't a huge gripe except Marriott has an option for early check in - subject to availability. I wish they would simply remove this option since there's really only downside for the hotel. It creates an expectation for the traveller and makes the hotel say 'no' to something on first impression. Notwithstanding, they were very gracious to take our bags and we went sightseeing in the meantime.The room was exceptional. Sometimes the Marriott interiors are so generic it's impossible to tell whether you are in Bangkok, Boston, or Bangalore. This is different - great pictures with SF themes and a true luxury edge to the room made this very special.Service was very good - I ordered a wine and cheese platter which came promptly as promised. The cheeses were excellent quality, Stilton, Camembert and Jarlsberg and beautifully presented. I travel a lot and it's clear they pride themselves on going the extra mile here.Downsides: I don't blame the specific hotel for the early check-in disappointment, but Marriott really does need to give better guidance as to how likely it is. The only other problem was all elevators were not fully functional which led to some delays lining up for the elevator, but this was minor.Upshot is: An excellent quality five star hotel which meets all expectations. I do recommend travelers to SF venture farther afield than downtown and explore places like the Mission, Haight, and Castro to get more of a real SF flavor."
3,2107,Nov 17 2009 	Great city great hotel	I've stayed at many Marriott locations around the world and this was my first time staying at a JW Marriott. The hotel is beautiful. A great lobby but this is matched by equally great spacious rooms which are tastefully furnished. I stayed there on points so I'm not sure if its really value for money if you're going to put your credit card down.There was one problem with the girl at the check in desk but that was a one off. (See had a bit of an attitude and got my room specifications wrong. It took a few phone calls to straighten it out.) However all other staff were great. They even refunded my the full bar tab when there was an issue with the bill. Concierge was great. Very knowlegable and informative. The hotel is central. Everything you need/want is around you or in walking distance.One of the best chain hotels I've stayed at....globally.Yes it was that good!
4,2107,"Nov 11 2009	Wedding weekend	We were staying at the JW Marriott for a long weekend in which a family member was getting married. We had an easy check in and the front desk staff was very accomodating. They answered all my questions and went above and beyond to help me when I needed it.The rooms were spacious for my DH and I. The bathroom was lovely and updated with granite counters and separate shower and tub. The beds were comfy and the TV had a good selection of channels. I ordered room service without any problems and my room &quot;valet&quot; was very nice.The wedding was also at the hotel. The ceremony was so nice and the wedding planner seemed very organized. The ballroom is gorgeous and the food was amazing! I am used to a lot of food being served at the cocktail hour but the wedding planner said they only order one passed item per person (So if you have 4 passed items, you are alloted only 4 pieces of food)...needless to say, we were ready to eat our dinner! It was a fantastic wedding and the bride and groom seemed so happy with everything!Parking was tremendously expensive...$40 per night. And as with most hotels, there were a lot of hidden charges. For example, if you took out a juice from the mini bar for more than 15 SECONDS, they charge you. Or they charge you if you put anything into the fridge."
5,2107,"Nov 10 2009 	This is a JW Marriott?	The hotel is located in an ideal location, adjacent to Union Square - and has an impressive atrium-style lobby with elevators that soar above you into the floors above. That was the high point - and our first impressions were quickly extinguished by several cleanliness and service issues throughout our stay. Even more importantly, the high-rise hotel abounds with hazards to young children with some windows that are too easily opened by curious toddlers. In my in-laws' room, the casement windows could be opened entirely - without any stops or locks of any kind. It was frightening and shocking that a hotel of this stature would allow such a hazard to go unmitigated (Room 1109). Our room, 1111, had windows that were easily opened by youngsters - but had stops on them. Still, the window opened widely enough so that a small child might be able to slip their legs through - so we were still quite jittery about ever allowing our daughter to get too near them.The cleanliness of the hotel was also a big problem. On arriving to our room, and using the toilet for the first time, I noticed some &quot;resi-doo&quot; under the seat that I had just lifted. Disgusting. Also, the glass shelves adjacent to the sink looked like they had not been cleaned in weeks. The brown-colored granite may have been nice when the hotel was new - but coupled with my toilet discovery, dirty shelves and dim lighting - I got the creeps.Once in the shower, the water pressure was SEVERELY lacking. And I know everyone is trying to save water, but why do we need to be subjected to water flow that more closely resembles an eye-dropper? The gym contains some unusual and awkward equipment is kind of dirty. Definitely not a fitness &quot;club&quot; - but a smallish room packed with mostly treadmills, elliptical machines, etc. Go someplace else - this hotel looks like a Marriott on the surface, but operates more like a Holiday Inn. There are way too many options in SF than to pay full fare for ecomomy class."
6,2107,"Nov 5 2009 	Could NOT have been more perfect!	The JW Marriott will rank in my top 3 hotels of all time! Everything was absolutely perfect. I just needed a leisure hotel for 2 nights, and Pricelined this hotel for $99 a night. However, my stay was priceless. The front desk staff was top notch, the conceirge was bang on with suggestions, and the room....ahhhh, the room. Could not be improved upon."
7,2107,Nov 5 2009 	Very nice and great location	Room was impeccable and club lounge had everything I needed for breakfast. Front desk staff was very helpful and polite. Excellent location to everything. Would stay again.
8,2107,"Nov 3 2009 	Great central location to downtown	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 1 night on a side trip to napa and San Francisco from Tahoe. I want to start off by saying that when we travel usually we are staying in resort beach areas, or Las Vegas, but all of them resort areas. Neither of us are used to staying in downtown hotels so I will start my review off by stating my only negative about the place, which was the size of the room. It was much smaller than what I am used to staying in, again because of the above because I'm sure its on par with most downtown hotels.The staff was very nice, especially the bell service. The person who brought our luggage up was very helpful and even made a little map for us to get to the apple store with because I had forgot my laptop charger. The rooms were very nice. Equipped with a king bed and flat panel t.v., I really enjoyed the room, with the exception of the size. We ate room service which was great, though expensive at $145 for both of us. The room itself wasn't that bad for $255 which included parking. If you stay here I would highly recommend booking a rate that includes parking as I believe it's $35 or so per night.The location is very handy to all downtown has to offer and you are about 1 block from the trolley's.One other thing I need to mention is the JW's lack of wireless internet. I stayed at the JW on Oahu in March and it also did not have wireless internet. They do have free wired service, but not having wireless is kind of a pain."
9,2107,"Oct 31 2009 	Great Location Excellent Hotel for Business or Leisure	I've stayed here on multiple occasions for both business and leisure travel and the JW Marriott San Fran excels at providing a solid experience. I am a very frequent business traveler (120+ nights a year) and this hotel has the right mix for me. Nice concierge lounge, good fitness center with weights and newer cardio, good area/neighborhood, great desk setup w/ herman miller chairs, and a comfortable bed. I get a great corporate rate, so I can't comment on cost/benefit. I am a loyal marriott guest and this is a top hotel in their group."
10,2107,"Oct 25 2009 	Great location clean good service	Stayed at this hotel attending a meeting which was held on-site. Piece of cake getting to the hotel from the airport on BART. Rapid check-in, although our two adjacent rooms were not ready at the time. Rooms are spacious and well-appointed. No real views. On the 11th floor, the room was quiet. I always love in-room coffee and the little one-cup device was perfect. Huge, comfortable bed. Good work desk and task chair. Didn't try the food in their restaurant, but the breakfast food at the conference was excellent. Easy walking to Union Square and Chinatown. Easy access to public transportation. Many decent restaurants in the area, within a 3 block radius. Lots of shopping, also."
11,2107,"Oct 19 2009 	Elegant comfortable great location	We booked a city view room, and also requested a high floor, which we got (floor 16). The view isnt the greatest (see pictures), but much better than looking at the wall of another building! The room itself was large, newly appointed, and of course had that great Marriott bed. The bathroom was the best part- spacious, lots of shelf space, mirrored walls, separate tub, etc. The atrium with glass elevators was gorgeous.The location is perfect for tourists- just one block from Union Square. One really nice feature if you are driving to this hotel is that it has a driveway on Mason Str. where you can turn in and leave your car for valet parking; at a lot of the other hotels in that area, you just have to try and find a place to pull over on the street in front of the hotel (always fun in downtown traffic). The valets were friendly and helpful, as were the receptionists. Highly recommended overall."
12,2107,"Oct 18 2009 	Terrific hotel	This is one of the beautiful hotels in San Francisco (and I have stayed at many) with a perfect location, lovely and rapid service, gorgeous room that looked brand new and a bed to die for. The bathroom was huge and gorgeous with a full bath that also had a hand sprayer and a separate shower with a full power shower head that rained down wonderfully. New flat screen LED TV (40&quot;).Small downside is that they charge for the in room safe which I found odd although they do offer one at the front desk. The reception desk is small, but the people are very efficient. Not sure what would happen in &quot;rush hour.&quot;I will stay here from now on. Just 2 blocks off Union Square on Post. Oh...a nice little touch was that the area outside where one might wait for a car or to meet up with friends has a comfy seating area."
13,2107,"Oct 18 2009 	Great place to stay	I did a lot of research on where to stay b/c I am very picky. I can honestly say that this hotel exceeded my expectations. Top of the line for everything, the room, bedding, service, etc. The room so very nice, very upscale and the bedding was very comfortable. The location is perfect. They spared no expense on this hotel. The concierge was extremely helpful! Very accommodating staff. I would definitely stay there again. The only bad thing I can think of is that they kinda scalp you on internet access(it's like $12.99), per 24 hour period. Wish it would have been a little more reasonable. We used our iphones instead. But, that is truly nitpicking and I would not use that one factor as a deal stopper, just more of an FYI if you wanted to use your laptop while you were there."
14,2107,"Oct 13 2009 	Great location helpful staff comfortable room with great bedding.	Great service-all the staff were extremely helpful especially the doormen and the concierge. Location had easy access to all tourist attractions. Room was clean, quiet and had the usual comfy marriott bedding-we need good pillows to sleep. After a day of walking the city, sit in front of the fireplace and have a drink. Nothing we didn't like."
15,2107,"Sep 23 2009 	Hotel was typical with a couple of small missteps	Hotel was in good union square location. As usual, I didn't have my profile requested extra towels, or fridge (minibar is stocked and not for personal items). As platinum elite, I was able to access VIP lounge, which is NOT ideal for leisure trips, as it was closed on weekends, ends early (9:30am I think) and was mostly a continental with scrambled eggs. No voucher for alternate to breakfast was offered.What rational does marriott use when considering wi-fi or internet access? Stay at a courtyard for $150 a night and get wi-fi for free, but stay at JW for $350 a nightand get nickled and dimed for an additional $25/night? Starbucks is across the street giving free wi-fi for a $2.50 purchase in case you hate paying so much for something that should be free.Next, Marriott continued to drop the ball by not informing guests in advance of rennovations on one of the 4 elevator shafts, and the outside awning. Noise and delays were minimal except for smal wait for elevator.But is was unfortunately the second time in a row this company which flawlessly communicates any and all marketing opportunities in advance of your stay, failed to communicate rennovations in advance. They can't seem to get this right for me, especially when staying for pleasure. The sirens never stopped, and despite the 19th floor room, the thin glass reminded us constantly, that we were in a city.In summary, the hotel was so-so. The view was OK (unless in VIP lounge), the location was fine, and the parking was a rape at $45/night despite other private garages in the area offering rates at half that. I would stay elsewhere if value is a concern for you, but if $350/night for an average stay doesn't concern you, then you will be satisfied with this choice."
16,2107,"Sep 19 2009 	Nothing to write home about.....	The property is nice but the staff is average. They didn't smile and never went out of their way to be helpful. In fact, we booked a room that came with VIP King Tut tickets. They should have given them to us at check in, but had to go down to the lobby twice to pick them up. We were so excited to be spending 2 days of fun in San Francisco that anything would have been appreciated. Nothing special....and the $55 a night to park the car is ridiculous."
17,2107,"Sep 18 2009 	Don't use the mini-bar or plan on sleeping!!	I stayed here for 5 nights on business. The room was fine, the staff were excellent and the location very good. However, the windows were like paper and kept neither wind or noise out. I was 9 stories up and you could hear everything from the street below, and I didn't get a good night's sleep. The frames seemed old and were metal with gaps.Also, they failed to put a price list in my minibar (I suspect deliberately, although couldn't prove it). If they had I wouldn't have had any beer. I'm used to minibar prices being inlfated and expected maybe $6-8 but $12 inlcuding tax for a little can of beer!!! They were seriously abusing me and I would never ever ever ever stay at a Marriott (or a partner) again after this rip off experience, and considering I spend so much time in hotels, that is quite a bit of business they are missing."
18,2107,"Sep 13 2009 	Wonderful modern hotel in a great location	We stayed at this hotel for two nights before heading to Napa. We checked in very late and were greeted by very friendly check in staff. The room was gorgeous and much larger than the rooms I'm used to staying in NYC. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had a large tub and separate stand up shower. It was a great location to many things we wanted to see while we were there. Finally, it has a great happy hour in the comfortable lounge area that we even came back to when we were staying in another hotel after coming back from Napa."
19,2107,"Sep 11 2009 	Fabulous stay on every level!	My husband, 9 yr old daughter and myself stayed at the Marriott from 22 - 28 Aug 2009. When we checked out it was like leaving family. From the Bell hop, concierge, front desk, cleaners to room service they were all so delightful, professional, friendly and helpful. Our room was immaculate, spacious and comfy, the decor tasteful. The bed and bed linen were dreamy, I wanted to bring the pillows home. We had room service dinner only once and it was well priced and delicious. I would highly recommend this wonderful hotel to anyone and if in San Francisco again will definitely be checking back in with my 'family'."
20,2107,"Aug 25 2009 	Perfect 40th Anniversary	The Marriott Staff saw to our every need so graciously. The location was perfect. Matt Ordway went way beyond expectations to find the perfect restaurants, make the reservations, provide transportation. We like Marriott but this was exceptional. AND the new &quot;look&quot; is fun."
21,2107,"Aug 16 2009 	Loved our stay at the JW Marriott Union Square	We just returned from a 4 night stay at the JW. Everything about it was fabulous! We had two rooms. They happily held our luggage until the rooms were ready, as we arrived before check in time. The front desk staff was polite and very friendly. The rooms were quite large, bed was so comfortable and everything about the hotel was immaculate! Very modern and beautiful decor! Concierge lounge had wonderful views of the city and was a great place for a snack and to relax outside of our rooms. Well worth any upgrade fees. Darlene the Concierge was so pleasant and helpful with directions, restaurant suggestions and getting us a rental car large enough for six during a very busy tourist season. Any staff member we asked for directions was ready with a highlighter to outline for us on the maps that the hotel has available. Jesse the Front Desk Manager was equally as helpful and pleasant and went out of her way to provide us with a truly great experience at the hotel!!!! Great hotel, fabulous location with shopping and restaurants everywhere, as well as easy access to any form of public transportation. Would highly recommend staying here during your next trip to San Francisco, and we will recommend to all we know. We will definately be back ! Thank you to the entire staff for a great trip."
22,2107,"Aug 10 2009 	Location location location...and the hotel's not bad either!	I'm not going to lie --one of the biggest reasons we chose to stay at the JW was because I had a plethora of Marriott Rewards points to use and a good friend said she'd had a great time while staying there. That was enough for us and it turned out we, like our friend, made a good choice. The hotel was a perfect home-base for our six night stay. The room was plush and comfy with a great bathroom; the service from check-in to check-out was great; we got some incredibly good advice from the concierge and had a pretty nice stay overall (We were even pleasantly treated to the hotel's car service the night of my birthday dinner. Maybe the fact we were dressed to the nines helped? Who cared either way; we came downstairs asking for a taxi and got a personal town car ride. That felt pretty glam!) The location itself cannot be beat. We were just a few blocks' walk to every form of public transportation imaginable...MUNI, buses, trains, cable cars, street cars. All were very easily within reach for us. The one caveat...parking. Yes, it's incredibly expensive. We paid $45 a night, which just felt like highway robbery, but I gather that's pretty standard at many of the hotels in San Francisco. Which is one reason that on our next trip to the City by the Bay, we'll be relying solely on public transport. Unless you're making some day trips out to wine country or other spots (like we did), you probably will NOT need the car at all."
23,2107,"Aug 7 2009 	Phenomenal location with acceptable service	The hotel is very modern; feels more like a boutique hotel in NYC which I really enjoy; rooms are well appointed and comfortable from top to bottom. Service however is acceptable; while the people are nice, they lacked the extra touch and 'anticipation of ones needs'. I would stay again, as long as I had no expectation of service. Its really too bad as the location and the rooms are top notch!"
24,2107,Aug 6 2009 	Not up to JW name	Overpriced; just average in everything else. Parking $50 a night; drinks high priced and not good; no papers delivered to rooms.
25,2107,"Aug 5 2009 	Great Hotel	Stayed at the JW from 7/29 - 8/4, had a great experience. The staff was very helpful with restaurant reservations, directions to attractions and overall questions. The room was very nicely decorated and very comfortable. Michael and Matthew at the conceige desk couldn't do enough for you. The only disappointing moment was when I asked the front desk if we could hold on to the room a little longer after the check out time since we weren't being pickup for the airport until 8:00pm our ladt day, I was told by an employee the hotel wasn't full and they will normally allow this I was also told to ask Antonio at the front desk, sothat's what I did I asked Antonio and he asked me my room number and then said no the hotel was booked. I got the feeling if I had stayed in one of the rooms that cost more he would have given me the room for a couple more hours I was willing to pay. Overall wonderful hotel and a wonderful trip. Love San Francisco."
26,2107,Jul 22 2009 	Great!	The location's great as it's near Union Square and Westfield Shopping Centre! Service was good and the room was clean.
27,2107,"Jul 20 2009 	Nice rooms good location for Union Square and trolley	The room was clean, bathroom was nice. Room was a little loud facing Mason, but it's a city. Staff was nice and attentive but lacked answers regarding the public transportation. Nice overall."
28,2107,"Jul 17 2009 	Very clean rooms and nice hotel staff.	My husband and I stayed a week here at the J.W. Marriott and had a great experience. We were in town for the Cisco Live! convention. Every member of the hotel staff we encountered was very nice and helpful. We stayed on the 21 floor with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. Our room was a nice size and very clean. The bed was comfortable along with the pillows. The flat screen TV was a plus along with the workstation. The computer chair is awesome! The bathroom is incredible. The towels are soft, plenty of water pressure in the shower, the separate tub is nice for soaking in, and the magnification mirror was awesome. The coffee provided for the coffee maker was also excellent. The hotel provided two bathrooms but we did not use them but they felt soft. The hotel also had air conditioning which we found out not all San Francisco hotels do! We never had to wait long for our car to be retrieved from valet parking and someone was always outside to open the door and answer any questions about the area. The hotel is in a convenient location to Union Square and Chinatown and is just a short hike away from the Mascone Center. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again if we are even in town."
29,2107,"Jul 6 2009 	Efficient service good location quiet rooms	Stayed for 3 nights...bellmen, valet, concierge were all helpful &amp; efficient. We didn't really use the hotel much for anything other than sleeping so I can't speak for the restaurant or business services. Internet in the room worked fine (though I hate paying for it since many hotels offer it for free). I know better than using the minibar. Fortunately, there's a plethora of wal-greens in the area to stock up on water or snacks. I wish the pillows were better. I'm not a huge fan of down pillows. They had firm ones too but they were like gigantic rocks. I guess it's hard to please everyone on bedding. I read so many reviews about SF hotels &amp; their claustrophobic rooms but this wasn't too bad. Overall, the room was nice (does need more drawers to unpack in). Very quiet in terms of noise from the hotel, but could hear street noise even from the 8th floor. I don't think the hotel had a spa but the concierge hooked up my wife &amp; friend at a nearby spa, so no complaints there. I got a great deal on this trip &amp; would definitely stay here again if the price was reasonable."
30,2107,"Jun 28 2009 	The best ever	Super service from entry court on up. Room gorgeous with view to the West, almost could see China in the distance. Needed &quot;early arrival&quot; room which exec gal arranged. Weneeded rack of lamb for dinner, concierge found just the right restaurant for our needs.A perfectly splendid trip. Hope to be back soonest..."
31,2107,"Jun 23 2009 	Almost a ""JW"" Marriott	My wife and I attended a conference in SF at the JW Marriott. The property is nice with a modern, open flair. But there were a couple of shortcomings. First, the rooms were nice, but there were not enough drawers to unpack luggage for a 4 day visit. The mini-bar is adequately stocked, but the prices are even more outrageous than one normal finds in a hotel room mini-bar. On top of that, there is a &quot;15 second rule&quot; posted in the door of the fridge that, in essence, says that if you remove any item from the mini-bar for more than 15 seconds, you WILL be charged for that item (plus the approriate tax and $20 &quot;re-stocking fee). The towels and linens were very rough on one's skin.Next, our one dining experience at the hotel restaurant was acceptable, however the food service during the conference (especially breakfast) was poor. The food was usually cold and a bit greasy - not what one would expect in a city that touts organic foods and a healthy lifestyle!The staff was very friendly and accomodating - an expectation in a JW Marriott. Overall - a good visit, but not quite what we would have liked. This property not a JW Marriott - but it's ALMOST there!"
32,2107,"Jun 18 2009 	Nice hotel for business trip	My husband and I stayed here for a night in December when he had a business trip of SF. The front desk staff was very nice and upon hearing it was my birthday, they upgraded us to a corner room on one of the high floors, so we had a beautiful view and a larger room. The rooms are nice, clean and beds are comfortable. The bathroom was nice sized as well. The hotel itself is modern (kind of sterile feeling). It is close to Union Square and a couple blocks from Chinatown. If you are travelling with kids, I would recommend staying closer to Fishermans Wharf, but for adults visiting, this is a nice choice."
33,2107,Jun 7 2009 	Will definitely stay here again!	I always try to stay in Marriott hotels because I'm a member of their rewards program. I was a little hesitant to stay after reading some of the reviews but I had a great experience! I travel a lot for business (at least two weeks out of the month) so I have stayed in my fair share of hotels. This was by far one of the best hotels I've stayed in.The staff at check-in was very friendly and gave me a couple options for rooms (one with a city view on the 19th floor or a larger room with a sitting area on the 12th floor) since I was scheduled to stay there for two weeks. I chose the view and it was great! Since I was by myself the room was definitely large enough for me and the bathroom was great. The rooms were clean and quiet (I'm a light sleeper so quiet is very important to me!)The concierge lounge had a very nice breakfast as well as appetizers and dessert at night. The staff at the concierge desk was great and helped me with every question I had. They gave me great recommendations and they were very friendly.The location of the hotel is great! Close to the cable car line and very close to union square with a lot of shops and restaurants! I will definitely be staying here again when I return to San Francisco!
34,2107,"May 27 2009 	HORRIBLE!!!	HORRIBLE HOTEL!! VERY, VERY, VERY bad service. Hotel associates are not helpful and make excuses for their lack of service. The hotel does not live up to the Marriott name. Even the managers were horrible. Front desk managers and associates were slow, not friendly, and not knowledgeable about the surrounding areas. Not worth the price. Restaurant Level 111 was DEAD, food was overpriced and tasted just ok. Computers available for guest use were not working and when we asked for assistance the Front Desk Manager was useless and did not call anyone to help therefore we were unable to print our boarding passes. First night we were there plug to tub didn't work. Next day when houskeeping cleaned they dismantled the drain and then just left it so we had to call to have it fixed. Door attendants were not friendly. Virtual concierge and concierge were not efficient, not friendly, not helpful with planning. Contacted the virtual concierge for tickets to an event which ended up being sold out, concierge as unable to provide any alternative or suggestions. Called concierge to arrange airport shuttle they were busy and told us they would call us back. They never called us back. We love SF but would NEVER stay at the JW Marriott EVER AGAIN!!"
35,2107,"May 27 2009 	Awesome Hotel Great Location a San Francisco gem at Union Square	This hotel has great amenities...great location... and generally excellent service. We used points to offset a few nights cost...and the hotel treated us like royalty. It was an amazing experience...with a high floor corner room with a great view of the city and the bay in the distance. The hotel staff were friendly and very accomodating, and seemed genuinely pleased we had selected thier hotel to celebrate out 30th anniversary. The room (small suite) was large for a city hotel and very clean...smelled great. The bar (Level III) had a great open space with computers and a large fire place....needed after a cool windy day. In the morning the bar turns into a Star Bucks...also needed to start a busy day. The outside staff are always ready to help...getting a cab to/from the airport is not a problem...cost about $45 (same as car parkinging). Speaking of cars, there are several rental agencies within 2 short blocks....and within that same distance is a broad spectrum of shops (high end), Union Square, cable cars, Market Street and a huge mall (the San Francisco shopping center). If you have a shopper in the family, this is Nervana. The location of the hotel is great, because you are out of the rush but just steps away from clubs and shopping and public transit....including the Powel/Market cable car ($5 each way). We did not dine at the hotel, other than order the wine and cheese sampler &quot;Best of San Francisco&quot;. We would not hesitate to return and highly recommend this hotel."
36,2107,"May 22 2009 	Courtyard By Marriott on Steroids	This hotel must be going bankrupt based on staff comments - I arrived late in the evening (around 10:30pm) but figured a JW Marriott would have room service to get a light dinner. Wrong! Operator told me they cut room service &quot;because they couldn't afford it during these difficult economic times.&quot; Later I called the concierge a couple times, leaving messages - still waiting for a call back. Probably cut that service during these difficult times. There was a button in my room for butler service - pushed and left pushed and never heard from the butler. Probably cut that service during these difficult times.The good - good location near Union Square. If you don't know SF, the area is a little gritty at night should you walk in the wrong direction but you are a block from Union Square and all the shopping and restaurants. Also, the rooms are quite spacious and well appointed in that Marriott instituational quality. This is not a bad hotel but don't pay a premium for it - as a long time Marriott customer, the only difference between this hotel and a Courtyard is that they had a lobby bar and restaurant. Of course, there are some Courtyards with lobby bars and restaurants so maybe there was no difference. Again, don't pay a premium for this hotel but feel comfortable there if you find a cheap rate."
37,2107,May 9 2009	Nice place to stay	Great for a weekend away - very convenient to public transport and SFO sites and attractions. Room was comfortable and clean.
38,2107,"May 4 2009 	Solid hotel with a great location	I have made two different trips to this hotel in the past month. The rooms are clean and well-furnished. The bathroom was large with a separate tub and shower. The shower is a bit small in the non-suite rooms. Service is very good. Yes, you have to request ice be brought to your room but it never took more than 5 minutes for it to arrive.Location is one block from Union Square. Cable cars, shopping, great restaurants are very close. The staff is very friendly and attentive. It is expensive but considering the brand and location that is to be expected. The hi-tech min-bar that charges you if an item is removed for more than 15 is a bit annoying. The sensor system in our room malfunctioned and we had over $100 in charges in two days. Wired internet access in the room is the usual $12.95 / day and it was a bit slow and erratic during the evening hours."
39,2107,"Apr 24 2009 	Very Nice	Stayed here in April '09 for 2 nights in conjunction with a business event. Although I'd say amenities are slightly below the other JW Marriotts where I've stayed, it was still very nice...more on par with a regular Marriott.Highlights include a modern lobby &amp; lounge. Rooms feature an upgraded bathroom w/separate tub and shower and a large LCD HD TV. Some reviews have been critical of noise from adjoining rooms but I heard nothing during my stay, despite a reported &quot;full house.&quot;I did not eat at the hotel's restaurant, but I did experience the hotel's food for breakfast, lunch, dinner and cocktails at a small business function. Food and service was outstanding!The hotel's location is convenient, near Union Square, but it is on the edge of the seedy Tenderloin district. As long as you don't venture too far in the wrong direction, you will be fine.My only complaint would be the slow internet response time I experienced. Internet rates were in line with other full-service hotels at $12.95/day that also included free local and long distance calls. Overall, a fine property that I would say is more suited to business travelers or couples, than families."
40,2107,"Apr 14 2009 	Taken a turn for the worse	This hotel became a JW Marriott @ 2 years ago. New owners then 'remodeled' the bathroom by removing the TVs and tub showerheads. Gee, usually a remodel involves improvement. Also removed most of the dresser drawers to install a mini-bar (note says that you will be charged if an item is removed for more than 15 seconds, or if you store items in the mini-bar). Had to live out of the suitcases. Ice bucket was dirty, and ice machines are not available to guests. Must request ice be brought to the room. Few towels provided, and they did not look fresh. One of the highest internet rates I've seen - $6.95 for 15 minutes. Another card in the room stated that guests will be charged $250 if the room smells of smoke. Room service costs definitely on the high end. Rooms/charges not at all family friendly."
41,2107,"Mar 30 2009 	Great location decent rooms average service	We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in August 08 during our first leg of CA trip holiday. Hotel is located right downtown, a block away from Union Square. All the designer shops, malls, good choice of restaurants, china town  everything is pretty much nearby. Concierge was quite helpful and recommended good restaurants (we asked for Chinese, Mexican, Italian and Japanese and all were very good). When we stayed in the hotel, lobby was under construction, so could not really tell how it was. Gym is ok, but nothing special. One night people next room had a party so had to call in the front desk. Only after the started smoking (which is illegal in CA) they actually did something about it. Room service was way below average. And it really bugged me that everyone expects to get tipped (but I guess it is just how America works). Other than that, hotel was nothing special. I thought it was worth it as I was paying with Marriott points and location allowed to explore SF easily. But I would probably not stay there have I been paying cash."
42,2107,"Mar 26 2009	Not up to JW Marriott international hotel standard	This hotel was a disappointment. The service (from the bell boys/porters to the concierge) were not particularly effective and seemed either bored or disinterested. The hotel room was a nice size and I appreciated windows that actually opened. The bathroom had a similar style to other JW Marriott hotel room bathrooms (lots of mirrors and glass, brown granite or marble everywhere), but the dusty rose bathtub and toilet were rather odd and out of place. The bathroom looked it had been partially renovated...The hotel is a few blocks from the Powell BART station and near Union Square.Considering the quality and service of other JW Marriott hotels that I have stayed in around the world, this location falls far short."
43,2107,Mar 21 2009 	Great location but not perfect hotel	Stayed here for a week after Xmas on Marriott points. Atrium style hotel with rooms circling lobby/bar/reception area. Slightly disappointed with room - felt a bit dowdy and a lot of noise from neighbouring room - could hear full conversations. Great bathroom - very big and well equipped and well stocked with towels and toiletries. View into neighbouring office and quite dark. Also expected small tv in bathroom - thought I read this in a review but not there. Entrance to lifts weren't in view of reception staff and lifts weren't manned so anyone could walk in off street and get into lifts and potentially up to rooms. I thought there should be a keycard system to get lifts up to room floors.Fab location so can walk to loads of shops/restaurants. We also walked to Fishermans Wharf - abour 30 mins. Handy for cable car. Easy walk to Market St for tram. A few doors from a great little theatre -Post St where we were able to see Dame Edna.Only had happy hour cocktail in bar as quite expensive. Concierge very helpful. Ice delivered very quickly to room. Our safe didn't work on arrival and we reported this but when we came back from a walk it was still unfixed - this was a pain as we were having to carry all our credit cards and passports. Phoned again and were told that we had to be in the room for it to be fixed - this was not specified the first time. By this time we were due to go to 49ers game and had worked out how and when to get bus from Union Square. Really didn't want to carry our valuables so asked if we could use a safe at reception. When we got there the receptionists were dead slow and stop -only one person with each but we waited 45 minutes during which time a huge queue built up behind us to check in. Eventually we got sorted - very slowly. I ended up waiting behind reception while someone tried to find safe keys and worked out how to work it. We were missing valuable time at the game and I was fuming...wrote a note to the head receptionist as she served someone else saying how disappointed I was with this debacle. On return from game expected an apology or something in the room but nothing. On check out got an apology then very strangely about a week later got an e-mail apologising profusely and offering the refund of the Marriott points for one night of our stay. Better than nothing but a quicker apology would have left a better taste!Not the best Marriott I have stayed in and if I had paid full rate I would have been somewhat disappointed.
44,2107,"Mar 16 2009 	Great Stay	This was a great hotel in a wonderful location in Union Square. Hotel was very elegant and clean. Rooms were large with very big bathrooms. The staff was very attentive and the valet parking was quick. Very comfy bed. Concierge was helpful. The butler button worked and the staff was quite fast with ice, wine openers, towels, etc. Would definitely stay at this magnificent hotel again"
45,2107,"Mar 6 2009 	Good hotel too expensive not for families though.	I was traveling on business to California so my wife and 9 month old son were traveling along. We stopped in San Francisco for a few leisure days. The hotel is nice with contemporary decor, friendly staff, and in a good location if you like shopping. The rooms are of average size. They were clean. The bathrooms were larger than I expected, although if you are tall beware of the shower head.We ordered room service. They got our order wrong all three times! The food was average to good, if you got what you ordered, but way overpriced - I don't care if I am in California or not. There are several good local restaurants nearby though.The beds are extremely soft. The rooms are quiet. The bell staff is very friendly and prompt with service. There is no pool at this hotel. There is also no place, other than your room, that is good to sit with children. The lobby is really cool to look at but not child/baby proof. You can only valet park at this hotel so get ready to get your wallet out because it is very expensive, near $50/day, plus tips for the guys. The neighborhood is definitely fine during the day. At night we were still comfortable out on the street but only because there were other people around. You will walk by homeless or beggers in this location. It also seemed there is a rather unsavory neighborhood not too far away in one direction. I would not have wandered too far at night, particularly because we had our baby with us. Overall this hotel would be great if you are traveling alone or with a girlfriend/boyfirend or spouse. It is chic. This hotel is not good for families, particularly families with young children. We would come back but not with children."
46,2107,"Feb 25 2009 	Fantastic Bed Nice Rooms lots of outside noise	Stayed here during a weekend in January for my wife's birthday. The hotel is a nice property but nowhere near some of the other JW Marriotts that I have stayed at but I think that has to do with those have been newly built while this one was taken over. The room was a decent size and the bed was out of this world. Had a nice LCD HDTV with HD programming which you don't see in all hotels these days. The location near Union Square cannot be beat! You are about a 5-10 minute walk away from the Square. We had dinner in the lobby bar the first night and the appetizers we had weren't bad (Garlic/Parm fries, Kobe beef sliders, and Chicken Satay,) We did not have breakfast at the hotel, ended up going to Starbucks just a couple of blocks down every morning. All in all, a nice place, great location and a wonderful bed!"
47,2107,"Feb 23 2009 	Slightly diasppointed - there are better options out there	I usally travel to San Francisco a few times a year and usually stay at the Marriott or Westin. Since my company has preferred rates with Marriott, I thought I would try the JW on my latest trip, and despite the location near Union Square (which couldn't be beat), I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed.My trip started off badly and I had to wait nearly a half hour at reception while my reservation was &quot;found&quot; - - this was despite the copy of my travel itinerary and confirmation number that I provided. Not exactly the way you want to be greeted after a cross country flight, but could deal with that.Overall, I found the room to be very similar to other Marriotts across the country although the bathroom was a little nicer - surprising given the premium marque.However, my biggest complaint was due to the room that was ultimately found for me and which was adjacent to the fitness center. Several times during the early mornings that I stayed there (think 4am), I was awakened by several tremendous &quot;crashes&quot; that shook the wall (and consequently the bed frame) as if the 'Big One&quot; had come. I later learned that my headboard was directly against the wall where the dumbells were located and some very rude people thought nothing of just dropping on the floor after use. IMHO, I would recommend staying at the Mariott on Market Street and pay a little extra for a corner or concierge room."
48,2107,"Jan 4 2009 	Bed so comfy!	I am writing this review from the hotel bed. It is so comfortable, I can't bring myself to get out of it! The hotel room is large also. We were very happy here.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because 2 days in a row the front desk gave us wrong information about concierge level lounge. So two mornings in a row, we missed breakfast. However, we told them to compensate us for a breakfast downstairs and they did. The breakfast buffet, by the way, is amazing.We were also given usage of the complementry house car. That was a great touch. My husband had his suit dry cleaned while we were here, and it was picked up and dropped off same day in our room. Great hotel in a great location in Union Square."
49,2107,"Dec 18 2008 	My favorite SanFran Hotel	I have been traveling to San Francisco extensively over the past two years, and always try to book the JW. I love the hotel overall, from the large, beautifully furnished and decorated rooms, to the helpful and friendly staff. The room layout and decor are so different than the 'standard' hotels that I am always pleasantly surprised when I check in.The recent renovations to the lobby area seem to be following the recent Marriott trend towards &quot;sleek and trendy&quot; that I've noticed in other Marriott properties. However,it doesn't work 100% for me here..sometimes feel that I'm not young or hip enough to hang out in the bar area..but I do anyway ;-). I have only eaten in the restaurant a couple of times since the re-do, and the food is very good, but pricey. And while the rooms are frequently less expensive than other area Marriotts during the work week, to be honest I would have trouble swinging more than a night or two if my company wasn't picking up the tab. Then again, this is San Francisco..and a great location to boot. A block from Union Square and theaters. Highly recommended."
50,2107,"Dec 7 2008 	excellent choice	My wife,son, and I stayed for 5 nights in the end of August!we used marriott points and just loved the property!we got a corner room that gave us a king bed and a sofa bedfor my son. We also was upgraded to the Concierge Level.most concierge levels offer a cont breakfast, this was morelike a full breakfast buffet. at 5p or so out came cheeses and vegetables and at least 2 hot appetizers.staff at the hotel was knowledgeable and friendly."
51,2107,"Nov 30 2008 	Not bad at all	Better than expected. It's located just 3 minutes walk from Union Square where all the shopping is located. 7 minutes walk from F train which will take you down to Alcatraz Pier. The hotel is modern and clean. The registration check-in is located on 3rd floor so you'll need to take elevator up once you walk in. The lobby is very attractive and we were graciously upgraded to the 15th floor. The room seem to be newly renovated, modern decor, big window, big screen LCD tv, big king size with bed, large bathroom with tub and separate shower with rain shower shower head, and two bathrobes for use. The bed was comfortable for one person but having another person, you can feel the springs or bed bounce a bit. The window is single pane so you can hear the emergency vehicles passing at night and cars honking. The walls are thin that you can't tell if someone is knocking on your door or your neighbors, I could also hear someone cough, turn page of magazines next door, their conversations weren't as muffled. The room was clean and maid left 2 chocalates for us the next day. Room service was fast and friendly. I have an iPhone and could not get 3G in the room...The room had everything we needed.Overall, we were happy with the stay and would stay here again."
52,2107,Oct 25 2008 	Not up to standards for a Marriott	The JW Marriott is not at all up to the standards I have always found at Marriott at all levels. 1. A wad of hair was on the bathroom floor.2.M&amp;M stuck on the table under the memo pad.3.a makeup bag under the drape left by a prior guest.4. A badly broken bathroom glass towels that were rough and not very White.5. Coffee served in the bar with the saucer full of slopped coffee and an attitude when the bar only had 3 other patrons and they had drinks already. 6. After putting on the butler button for ice I waited 30 minutes before calling the desk to send up ice.7. I had to request cereal bowls and ceral spoons for breakfast and cheese was served without crackers.8. The hotel charged 12 a day for WIFI and it is free at the less expensive Marriott brands.The front desk and Conceriage were terrific as were the men who maaned the front door. I would suggest you spend your money else where when in San Francisco.
53,2107,"Oct 19 2008 	Pleasantly surprised	I usually prefer to stay in smaller boutique hotels, however we booked at the Marriott since we had a gift certificate to put towards our room. When I first walked in, it felt a bit like I was in a mall (the bright patterned rugs, statues, elevator music, etc). We had to take an elevator to reception and it all felt a little impersonal. But, there are some great advantages to staying at a larger hotel like this. First, our room was huge compared to other city hotels I've stayed in. And, when we came home late one night and I realized I ran out of contact solution, the reception desk opened up the hotel convenient store for me. I was so grateful that I didn't have to roam around late at night to find an open store to buy contact solution! Overall the hotel was very clean and the service was great."
54,2107,"Oct 12 2008 	Great end to our holiday at the JW Marriott SF	I stayed at the JW Marriott at the end of a holiday driving around California. I'm a Marriott Platinum member (i.e. I stay in Marriotts 100+ nights a year) so my treatment might not be typical for all guests.First impressions were 'hmm' - the hotel looks very nice, but, strangely the lobby was on the third floor, with the entrance on the first floor. As we were driving there we were also a bit stuck as the hotel's driving entrance is actually on Mason street, and due to SF's one way system this wasn't so easy to get back onto, so, if arriving by car try and get onto Mason/Post. Parking is expensive in San Francisco in general, you are better not bringing the car if you can avoid as you certainly dont need it in the city. There is a Hertz location in the hotel, and there is also one on Mason street that is less than a block away as well.However, arrival was great, the hotel lobby is lovely, and the roof actually opens up all the way to the top of the hotel (21 floors). The elevators also look out on the same view, so it can be really nice to be travelling up to your room if you're on a high floor (or to the bar/rest area on the 21st floor).Got to our room on the 18th floor, it was nicely big, and had a nice view in that we could just see the bay and it is always nice to be high up. (See the photos on this review to see the view we had). The bed was a typical Marriott one (i.e. lovely and relaxing), the bathroom was very well presented with marble, bath robes provided (nb: one under the bathroom sink for some reason, the other in the wardrobe as usual) and a lovely shower. My wife also enjoyed the bath. The TV was also very nice - a huge 42&quot; High def affair, with a lot of channels choice. As a nice touch the room also had a 'valet call' button - so you could press it and the valet would come to your room, a nice touch (a little like the 'butler bell call' in old style houses in England). The room also had an ipod base to play music around your room (didn't have one to know how well it works)We also had access to the club lounge, on the 21st floor, for breakfast and nibbles. It was quite busy, but, had amazing views of the city, a very comprehensive breakfast (more like an American breakfast than a continental one), and they'd even lend you a DVD player if you wanted.Service from the staff was great, and they even allowed us to check out late as our flight was in the evening. Everyone was very polite and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay - just a shame that it was only for a single night.Final point on location - though the hotel claims to be on Union square it is actually a block away... doesn't make any difference, but, a minor point. But, otherwise the hotel is in a great location - excellent shopping within a few blocks, the same with the cable cars. The area was also very safe late at night with lots of traffic and light in our view.We stayed at both this and the San Francisco Marriott on our trip, and this one is definately nicer, so, if we were coming back to San Francisco we'd try to stay here if possible (Bear in mind I'm loyal to Marriotts!)"
55,2107,"Sep 2 2008 	Nice Hotel Good Location	I would recommend the JW Marriott in San Francisco for any stay. My wife and I stayed there for a anniversary and received great service. We were greeted at check-in by Bianka, who was exceptionally nice and welcoming. The hotel has some construction (as of Sept. 2008) on the first floor (near the valet parking area), but it did not affect us in any way. We didn't hear anything from it or notice it, other than when we got in the elevator.The room was nice, with a great view of the city. Great TV and bedding, plus a high quality bathroom. The hotel was even VERY helpful in getting to a SF Giants baseball game .... the hotel car service took us right there! The location is good, a couple blocks from the cable cars, which take you everywhere a tourist would want to go. Taxicabs are also easily grabbed, if needed.We stayed with Marriott points (which was a steal given the price of some hotels in San Francisco), so I cannot comment on value for the various rates.Overall, I would strongly recommend this Marriott property."
56,2107,Aug 25 2008 	Good hotel in SF	The staff at the hotel were really helpful and listened to our requests. The suite was nicely decorated and very comfortable. There were a few issues however they were resolved very quickly.Only issue they couldn't resolve was some noise from the disco.
57,2107,"Aug 24 2008	Nice digs just no 'special' vibe	I have nothing to complain about except I wanted more 'glamour' for my families' vacation. The room was very nicely appointed, albeit small for a family of 4 (why do so many hotels think that 2 double beds are good for 4 people, why not have queens?) The service was excellent, and mostly friendly or neutral, never bad. The location was good. It was just not special in any way, considering the money paid. Just felt like a very nice business hotel..... maybe that is all it is supposed to be.... where I would have preferred a destination luxury hotel."
58,2107,"Aug 20 2008 	Great Hotel Located Conveniently in Union Square	We booked the JW using points and wanted to stay in downtown SFO in a location convenient to the many attractions. We had a rental car for one of the days in the hotel, but not the other two.First, if you have a car, parking is expensive - upwards of $50/night. There's no self park unless you want to drive around looking for a public garage, which I would not recommend.As with any JW, service is fantastic. People call you by name, the front desk answers on the first ring, etc. The lobby is beautiful and you may get lucky and get a high room overlooking the city. Our room was lower and was next to a business office. We could see people in each window working at their desks - and I'm sure they could see us.Room is quiet at night except for the occasional siren from the street (police, fire). The room is on the smallish side, but not terribly small. Bathroom is updated and new (clean!). There's a tub with jets in it along with a small shower stall. The showerhead was low enough so it was below my nose and the stall was small enough so my elbows hit the wall when I turned (I'm 6'1).The other odd thing is that the bathroom has no locking door - just a sliding door. So if you're with a family, people are apt to walk into the bathroom when it's being used.Beds are comfortable. There's a mini bar that senses when you take something out and charges you. You have like 10 seconds to look at something before it charges you. We asked for a fridge and promptly brought it up and set it up. That worked well as we were able to buy some drinks and keep them in the room.As with a JW, everything is expensive, including room service, mini bar, etc. Be prepared to tip people.The location is fantastic. A short walk from the hotel is Union Square with a mall, including Macy's. It's also the terminus of a cable car route. There's quite a line at times,but you can ride it all the way down to the wharf in about 15 minutes.It's also walking distance from China Town and North Beach. There's a number of restaurants nearby. We were going to take a cab to the airport at the end of our stay, but it turned out that they have a limo that costs the same as the cab (about $45 + tip). It was a nice end to the vacation.I would recommend the JW as a place to stay that's very nice and away from the tourist areas - but also a place where you can get to the tourist areas without much trouble."
59,2107,Aug 14 2008 	A gem in the city	This hotel was beautiful and centrally located a block from Union Square. We were informed upon an early checkin that our room was not ready therefore we would be offered and upgrade to a suite which I humbly accepted. Beautiful comfortable room on the 17th floor. The staff was excellent from bellman to front desk and housekeeping. We walked and rode all over the city with my 5 year old and enjoyed coming 'home' to the tranquility of the JW Marriot in the afternoon. The fitness room was equipped well with cardio equipment and fair with weight equipment.We will certainly return.
60,2107,"Aug 8 2008 	Nice location beautiful hotel okay view	Beautiful hotel, both inside and out. We got an excellent rate using expedia. The hotel is located in union square, making it extremely convenient to get around."
61,2107,"Aug 5 2008	Room Without A View	Based on mostly favorable reviews we booked our room through Orbitz on very short notice. We had a late check-in on a Friday night, around 8:00 PM. I had requested 2 double beds and specified I would be traveling with my girlfriend . Upon check-in they basically said (looking down the end of their noses), &quot;Too bad, there are only king beds. If you have a problem with that you need to take it up with your &quot;booking company&quot;. &quot; Although we had used a &quot;booking company&quot;, with parking, our room was $355.00 per night. Not exactly a paltry sum in my book. I didn't really feel like we were being cheap in any way, but that is exactly how they made us feel. I definately had the distinct feeling that booking indirectly is looked down upon. We headed to the 8th floor, walked into our room and thought things might be looking up a bit. The room seemed spacious, and it appeared the bed was an Eastern King, so sleeping with my girlfried in the same bed 2 nights might not be as awkward as I thought. I proceeded over to the window to check out the view and was greeted by a solid wall of the adjacent building. I guess we would have to take that up with the &quot;booking company&quot; too. The last straw for me was breakfast on Sunday (our only meal with the hotel thankfully). We shared oatmeal, a fruit plate, muffin, and both had a latte. Our bill with tip, was $31.00. The oatmeal was beyond bad, we could barely choke it down. The fruit plate (one banana and a handful of berries) was $15. The bran muffin???????? I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. If this is the kind of treatment you get when using a booking company, I will be hard pressed to use them either."
62,2107,"Aug 1 2008 	JW Marriott	We thought the hotel was in an excellent location to be able to walk to many of the places we wanted to explore. The hotel had undergone a major renovation and much of it appeared new. We thought the room was reasonably sized with a large flat screen tv and well stocked. The place was very clean and the maid service was very good. We echo some of the other comments that the front desk staff could be a little more friendly and informative and the same could be said for the concierge desk. Except for that, we enjoyed our stay and would go back to this hotel on our next visit to San Fran."
63,2107,"Jul 28 2008 	Room:Gorgeous Staff:Horrible NEVER staying again.	When my family and I first arrived a bell boy ran to our door and asked if we wanted help with our bags, I said yes and waited for about 15 minutes with no response and took our bags up three floors to the check-in desk. Once we arrived a VERY snotty girl who was working asked what type of room we wanted. I clearly payed for a one room with two double beds because I have 3 children, she then began to tell me becuase we didn't book the room directly from them there was 'no guarantee' we would get the room, she then proceeded to tell us we will be on the waiting list of 15 people who also wanted a room with two double beds. My children were forced to sleep on the floor, we called numerous times for extra blankets and pillows, but no-one came our way. The rooms, however, are gorgeous. There was hardly any water pressure in ours though. My next trip to San Francisco, i'll skip this hotel."
64,2107,"Jul 25 2008 	pleasant stay at JW Marriott	I am very tardy in recording this experience, which occured in late March of this year. The hotel is well-placed for getting around in the city by any means, and we felt quite comfortable in the Union Square area. The corner room near the top of the hotel was superb, as was the housekeeping staff. Despite construction being present, the staff made efforts to not allow it to be an impediment to our 5 day stay. The consierge staff was mistaken on their suggestions/ directions a few times, and provided out-dated information. At this hotel, we were very near excellent restaurants, shopping, and transportation within blocks of the hotel. American Airlines lived up to its reputation for tarnishing an otherwise enjoyable vacation in a beautiful hotel with a great staff."
65,2107,"Jul 22 2008 	Good Location Fair Price	Recently stayed at the JW Marriott in SF. San Francisco is a great trip if you're looking for a long weekend vacation. A few notes:- Cab from SFO to hotel which was located in Union Sq was about $35 dollars. As always, knowing approximate cab rates is always important so you don't get ripped off.- The JW Marriott for a luxury hotel is what you expect in a city like San Fran. Space is pricey, so the rooms were nice, but small. Large flat screen tv was a plus, but for a JW, the luxury was minimized a bit by the space. Also, the bathroom was fairly large, but felt very dated.Service is great though, with an in room butler button for your use. A few times I requested towels and other items, and a person came to our door in less than 5 minutes. As for the hotel itself, the restaurant and bar was undergoing construction which is scheduled to be done later this summer. Should be pretty nice as it'll be brand new. Hotel location was ok, union square doesnt have much 'sites' but a good shopping and walking area. Trolley cars and bus lines are just 2 blocks over, and the neighborhood is also walking distance to Chinatown, Nob Hill, the Financial area and a large mall as well. - As for attractions, make sure you hit the regular spots, nothing wrong with being touristy. I recommend: Chinatown is great for dinner (better dinner than breakfast to be found there) and the old fashioned bakeries are great. The Golden Gate Bakery has the best fresh egg custards. Alcatraz tour is pretty interesting, and you can purchase tickets in advance on the internet which gets you on the shorter &quot;will call&quot; line. For baseball fans, catch a Giants game. Even if the teams are just ok, tickets can be had cheap and you'll definitely appreciate the park. The food options are ridiculously great."
66,2107,"Jul 11 2008 	Great but ""not Wow""	So I probably one of the few that am not giving this hotel 4 stars. Knowing the Marriott brand well I have even higher expectations for their flagship line, the JW Marriott hotels. I had a nice stay but have stayed at far nicer JW's in other cities. We arrived around 10pm and had to wait outside for someone (anyone) from the Bell Desk to valet our car. Next step was check-in and having never been to the hotel before, I didn't realize you had to go to the 3rd floor for check-in until I asked someone else on the 1st floor that looked about as lost as I did. Check in once we found it was quick and pleasant. We had a very well appointed room on the 16th floor, the bathroom was probably the nicest area in the room. I have seen Renaissance hotels (another Marriott line) and other JW's with nicer rooms; the look was fresh and modern but some of the furnishings looked a little too well used. Checkout was slow because the checkout through the in-room TV did not work and there was a lengthy line at the front desk downstairs. The concierge lounge breakfast was almost top notch and the concierge recommendations on area restaurants were most welcome. They continually advised us to avoid walking in the neighborhod late at night... for a reason I never understood. The neighborhood seemed fine to us with lots of people out, even after 12 midnight on a week night."
67,2107,"Jul 2 2008 	extremely nice	We stayed here while in town for a friend's wedding. We were very impressed with the location and the room, and will absolutely come back when we are in town again.Check-in is on the third floor. When we first arrived, we wandered around for a bit before we realized that we had to go upstairs. The one thing that the hotel does need to work on is its downstairs bell-staff - not only when we first arrived, but every time we entered and left the building, there were very few employees on the ground floor, and they seemed to be making a concerted effort to ignore the guests. Otherwise, service was very good. At check-in, the front desk gave us a masterfully worded note from the manager, explaining that it was the weekend of the gay pride parade, so there were a lot of wonderful activities in town, but guests needing to travel on Sunday should allow themselves extra time - it was beautifully done.The hotel decor was very nice, more modern than the typical JW Marriott, looked like it was just renovated. The lobby spaces, bar, etc. were very nice and fairly busy while we were there. The room was a good size, beautifully furnished, very large bathroom, good amenities, linens, and a very comfortable bed, large window, pretty good view, and very quiet. The location was great - close to Union Square, but a block or two away from the hectic masses."
68,2107,"Jun 24 2008 	Best Marriott in San Francisco	I arrived in San Francisco via the Amtrak Thruway Bus from the Emeryville train station. I arrived early but the friendly front desk person was able to find me a room on the ninth floor. Check in was smooth and fast. There was a makeshift lobby on the ground floor because the main lobby on the 2nd floor was being remodeled and was scheduled to open sometime that week.My room was good size by San Francisco standards. The rooms had recently remodeld so there was none of the decor and furnishing from the properties previous version, the Pan Pacific. My room was clean. I was a bit concerned about hearing street noise on the 9th floor but the street noise did not bother during my entire stay. Besides a desk and chair in the room there was a flat screen t.v. and chair and ottoman. The t.v. featured many cable channels. There are no ice machines on the floor so you press a conciere button for them to bring up the ice. There were two complimentary bottles of water which were replenished each day. Their a good size closet on the on other side of the wall from the sleeping area with safe in the closelet. I really like properties that offer safes in their rooms. Also a bathroom that features marble and granite and also features both a separate shower and tub. The room was cleaned well each day. the water pressure and temprature were fine. The king size bed was comfortable.I was attending the Human Resources Planning Society workshop on Succession Management and Leadership Development at this property. Continental breakfasts and lunches served during the workshop were good. The conference room was long and narrow a bit of odd shapefor a workshop. The HRPS workshop had both hits and misses. I'll look foward to their Fall Executive Forum in October at the Renaissance in downtown Chicago. I ate breakfast one day in the temporary dining room in the basement. Excellent service there and very good food. For they buffet they will even prepare you pancakes, waffles and/or omellets. The pancake as well other breakfast items were fine.One of better Marriott buffets with superb service!All of the folks I came into contact were very good. The door men and bellhops were all friendly and attentive. I even was able to use to the house Lincoln towncar. The driver was friendly and nice.The gym is a good size facility which was well lighted and ventilated. I used the gym on three occasions.Just down the street west on 700 Post st. is a very good Indonesian restaurant called Boroudur. Attended by many Indonesians. I also recommend in the basement of the San Francisco Shopping Center on Market Street between 5th and 6th. is a food circus with many great affordable choices. In particular I can recommend Sorabol Korean BBQ &amp; Asian Noodles. Also good is Tom's cookies in the food circusOn one evening, some of us went to Alcaratz for the night tour. You get a wondeful view of the city but the place is a bit depressing.I can highly recommend the J.W. Marriott property in San Francisco as one of the bettter places to stay. I received both a special group rate and the HRPS rate as well! I'll stay here again!"
69,2107,"Jun 23 2008 	Nice accommodations at the JW San Francisco..	Just returned from a great weekend stay at the JW before heading up to wine country. I had mixed feelings originally from reading postings about this hotel but decided to give it a try anyway. Actually we got a great bonus for staying the weekend we did. The hotel had a big relaunch party Friday night of their lobby restaurant that had been under renovation. All guest of the hotel were invited and it was a blast. There was music, live entertainment many hors doeuvres from sheared scallops to mini bar burgers, wine, champagne and cocktails which were all complementary! Now how did we luck up on this party in downtown San Francisco? Dont know but Im sure glad we did!The rooms were tastefully done with a modern dcor. The bathroom was marble with a separate tub and shower. Since the recent renovation all rooms have a 42 flat screen TV that I could appreciate. The location is great close to Union Square, easy to get around town from this place. The hotel is not that large overall and I felt the hallways were a little tight. I workout while traveling and the fitness area was adequate for an on the road workout. Its equipped with ellipticals, treadmills, free weights and a few weight machines. If youre looking for the hardcore workout you get at home you will need to inquire about a local gym.The concierge was awesome in recommending things to do in the area and sights to see! One great recommendation was to stop at La Taqueria while we were in the mission district. The best weve ever ate! The entire hotel staff was friendly and helpful during our stay.We had a great time and would definitely stay here again while in the Bay Area."
70,2107,"Jun 22 2008 	Lovely hotel and great service	We stayed at the JW Marriott as the last stop on our honeymoon. The experience was great from the moment we arrived. We were greeted warmly with a big congratulations, and our room was upgraded. We were also given access to the club lounge, which was excellent. The room was very nice and spacious, and when we ordered room service it was of a high quality. The hotel is in a very convenient location and the service was excellent throughout our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay in San Francisco."
71,2107,"Jun 17 2008 	Outstanding Hotel	My wife and I recently spent a three day weekend at the JW. The hotel and staff were terrific. The hotel has just gone through a complete renovation and everything is new and spotless. The room, bathroom, club lounge and lobby were all first-rate. The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the Powell St BART station, Powell-Mason cable car turn-around and F-line streetcar. China Town is less than a 15 minute walk. I used points for this stay. Nice job, Marriott.I would defiinitely stay there again."
72,2107,"Jun 12 2008 	Loved the JW Marriott	We spent 7 nights at the JW Marriott this past April with our 6 and 10 year old kids who were out of school on spring break. The hotel is conveniently located a couple of blocks from Union Square. Our &quot;executive&quot; room was tastefully decorated and included a very comfortable king size bed, a sitting area that included a sofa bed, chair and tables, as well as a desk, 42&quot; LCD TV and a minibar. The bathroom was great--tastefully done including a large tub and a separate shower. The hotel just went through a renovation and all of the decor (carpeting etc) is brand spanking new.The staff was very attentive, and the concierge desk was fabulous -- recommending everything from dining options to tours and directions.The only criticisms that I might have is that there isn't enough drawer space for clothing -- the hotel seems to primarily cater to business travelers (which is understandable) who stay for short periods of time. Additionally, the lobby was under construction and we were unable to appreciate it. All in, we loved the hotel and would definitely stay again on our next trip to SF."
73,2107,"May 29 2008	Business Trip	I recently was in SF on business and was booked at the JW Marriott on Post St. I arrived late in the evening and was exhausted. The staff made check in very easy and placed me in a beautiful room on the 20th floor. They even ordered a fruit and cheese plate that was delivered to my room within 5 minutes of having my bags brought up. The next morning I was able to appreciate a scenic view from my window - facing toward the bay and able to see Alcatraz!The room was nicely appointed in bold colors and modern decor - the bath has a large tub (separate from the walk-in shower) which was great to relax in at the end of a hectic day.The concierge was extremely helpful in planning some sight-seeing and also very accommodating in getting dinner reservations at a very lovely Italian restaurant down the street.The hotel is 1.5 blocks from Union Square where you can shop 'til you drop! And also catch the cable car down to the wharf. The hotel was smaller than I expected, but I feel that improved service."
74,2107,"Apr 30 2008 	Love It	We love that hotel very nice good beb good service ,clean ,perfect location . For breakfast ect you are all around restaurent like Sears Finest dinner you all around good restaurent .Attraction walk every where the location was perfect .From Maine April 2008"
75,2107,"Apr 30 2008 	Wonderful Hotel!!!	We stayed at the JW Marriott San Francisco the week of April 21st. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman and front desk girl. We were checking in very early (9am) and she offered us an upgrade to a suite at 50% off (someone had just cancelled their reservation). We took it and were so glad we did! The room was awesome. The bathrooms are fantastic and the beds are extremely comfortable (even my &quot;mattress critic&quot; husband thought they were great). The only renovations still happening at the hotel is the restaurant and that was no big deal since we rarely eat at hotel restaurants anyways. We did try the hotel food once and it was very good. The hotel seemed very busy with room service orders.The customer service was not notch, probably second only to the Four Seasons hotels. They have a butler button you can press in the room and they send someone up to your room. I don't think we waited more than 3 minutes each time we used it and we used it at least once a day. Every evening we ordered up some ice. We found that by the third night or so that they started to bring up the ice automatically when they did our evening turn down service. Great service!The had refreshments in the lobby, which varied depending on the the time of day. I tried out the pink lemonade and it was great. Very refreshing on a hot day.The location is awesome. So close to Union Square. The walk was about a minute long. I would certainly stay at this hotel the next time we get a chance to visit San Francisco. We were first time visitors and this hotel made our experience very memorable."
76,2107,"Apr 29 2008 	Great Location	We enjoyed our stay here. Great location right near shopping and dining of Union Square and the financial District. Walked most places even to the Ferry building at the piers and it was a nice flat walk from here.Room was very nice and clean with very comfortable king size bed and great bathroom. Staff was helpful and pleasant. Even though the hotel is under going renovations, we heard no building noise. The front desk arrival area is a bit underwhelming which I hope will change with the completion of the reno. My only complaint was on two occasions seeing dirty room service dishes laying out in hall for 8 or more hours straight (yuck). I would expect better from a JW Marriott propertyI would stay there again next time I am in San Francisco though as the pluses definitely outweighed the negatives."
77,2107,"Apr 22 2008 	Great Hotel	Great hotel, centrally located, and very clean. I'd definately stay here again."
78,2107,"Apr 20 2008	Avoid At All Costs!!	I stayed here over christmas time and would you believe I left the car for literally 5-10 minutes parked outside so that I can check into the hotel, and the Valet people outside said we MUST leave our keys with them. So we did, a little hesitant, and guess what. THEY STOLE OUR RADAR DETECTOR SO FAST. We left our car parked in a different location, no signs of break ins AT ALL, and this hotel would not admit that they stole it. This detector was left in the glove compartment, and they must have took it very fast because they broke a piece of it off. We DEMANDED to see footage and they would not let us when they claimed that they videotape everything outside. THIS IS A 5 STAR HOTEL PEOPLE - THIS IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT PEOPLE!!!!! This hotel was especially not worth the price when they are thieves! They wouldn't even reimburse us or anything, they just kept saying it wasn't them when CLEARLY it was. This car was not touched nor used at all the entire trip EXCEPT by their valet service who JUST was supposed to hold the keys in case they needed to move the car. They also switched their story on us like 5 times which was PROOF they took it. It took 4 months of them to supposedly try to figure out what happened, probably so that we wouldn't write a review on them. They did nothing to help or solve the matter but waste time. They are encouraging their personnel to steal things from people's cars because the have a circle where everyone is involved and split the costs. I've heard about hotels doing this, and would have never thought the JW marriott hotel would stoop so low. DON&quot;T EVER STAY IN THIS HOTEL!!! I will NEVER stay in a JW marriott or marriott related hotels EVER AGAIN. They lost me and my family as a customer, as well as every friend and person that I know of, and hopefully YOU. I've valet my car at restaurants and various 3 star hotels or under with that radar detector in it and NOTHING ever happened. For a 5 star hotel to do such a thing, SO LOW... so VERY low. Please tell all your friends not to stay at Marriott hotels. They need a serious change before anyone should ever go back."
79,2107,"Mar 31 2008	Beautiful	The room was huge! The linens were luscious; I loved being in the ultra soft pillow bed with comforter and pillows around me. The bathroom was small but it was fine for just one person. It might have been tight for two. I loved the sundries so much that I ordered the lotion on line. I was there for business, and I can say that coming back to the hotel was truly a retreat. Great location. Staff was excellent."
80,2107,"Mar 25 2008 	JW Marriott is First Class	The location of the JW Marriott is ideal! Close (1-4 small blocks)to all Union Square and Westfield mall shopping, restaurants, cable car, and Hertz rental car, which is good when you choose to rent a car to explore the city and exterior areas like Sausalito and Muir Woods, etc. The staff was always attentive, the rooms were always clean and orderly, and a door was always opened for you before reaching the front door. There were other nice amenities like ice buckets filled nightly, as well as extremely quick and efficient service when it came to any room requests that were out of the norm, along with the morning coffee and afternoon tea in the lobby made for a nice comfortable stay. The rooms are nicely decorated with warm colors making it feel more like home. A positive overall experience equating to a definite return the next time I'm in San Francisco."
81,2107,"Mar 24 2008 	Fabulous Experience!	Stayed at the Marriott for a conference and would definitely stay again. Room was clean, comfortable (with feather beds and down comforters), and offered a nice view of the city. Internet wasn't free, but you could get the $4.95 option for 24 hours and they provided the Internet hookups-- in other hotels, you either have to provide your own or pay for the the cords. Staff was courteous and friendly. When I needed something printed for an 8 am presentation and the business office wasn't open until 8 am, the concierge allowed me to print from her computer. When I asked for a late checkout, the front desk was extremely friendly and gave me a 2 pm checkout. When there was an overcharge on the hotel bill, I called the front desk and it was changed immediately. Great location, near Union square, BART station (took it from the airport), can take the trolley down to Fisherman's Wharf for 1.50. Everything is really accessible and everyone was very friendly. Food is expensive at the hotel, but Mel's Diner around the corner is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
82,2107,"Feb 27 2008 	Fabulous Fabulous Fabulous	After reading the reviews before my stay I made sure that when I checked in I asked for a renovated room. The front desk staff said that all the rooms have been completely renovated. The room I stayed at was the best Marriott property room I ever stayed in. The rooms are big, the beds are wonderful, 52 inch flat screen TV, the color themes in the room are warm and relaxing and the bathroom I must say is a work of art. The brown marble walls and showers are beautiful. The doormen were always there opening the doors as you entered or exited the hotel, asking if transportation was needed, they were just wonderful. The front desk staff could not have been any nicer than what they were, and the staff walking around the hotel were very attentive. My first night there I was walking around the hall with my ice bucket not knowing that all you had to do was call from your room and someone would bring some ice to you, well as I was walking a staff member noticed my ice bucket and asked what room I was in and he would have someone bring me some ice, with in 3 minutes someone was there with ice. How wonderful is that.I guess the lobby and restaurant is going thru renovation and will be completed by end of March but you would never know it. They have the check in area so concealed from any work that you would never know that work was being done. The area around the hotel is safe and so many shops and eating areas plus any type of transportation is a block away (trolley cars). I cant wait to go back...."
83,2107,"Jan 18 2008 	Beautiful hotel in a top location!	We visit San Francisco at least once a year, but twice last year. For the first time we stayed at this hotel. We had been staying at the Donatello, across the street, but a price comparison indicated that the Marriott rooms were less than the Donatello's patio rooms. Thus we elected this J.W. Marriott.We admired the hotel when it was the Pan Pacific. It's windows and architecture are unique. The open atrium remains stunning. The street entry is nicely protected from weather. We found the personnel at the entry very helpful and accommodating and they stored my golf clubs without hesitation, retrieving them at my request and without delay. They made arrangements for a limo to SFO upon our departure and it was ready and waiting right on time. We asked for a high room and received one. We looked at one of the redecorated rooms on the west perimeter of the structure and found it extraordinary, though it was not then available to us. Renovation continued on the top floors.Our room view was onto Mason. It was very nice and quite clean. We guessed, but do not know, that many of the oriental housekeeping staff were retained when the hotel changed hands. They are top notch! The furnishings, though certainly not new, were in good condition and clean. All furnishings worked well. We requested an additional luggage rack and it arrived almost immediately. As we do not dine in our rooms, we cannot otherwise comment on room service, but when we left the hotel in the mornings, generally early, we simply spotted one of the housekeeping ladies nearby and asked for a cleaning. We never failed to find a cleaned room upon our return. We also found the front desk personnel to be very friendly and helpful. We tend to make our reservation many months in advance, with any requests for special services, so we weren't surprising anyone on the spur of the moment. We were treated well.We ate one supper in the hotel restaurant. It was not particularly remarkable, but, considering the available restaurants within walking distance of the front doors of the hotel, that is not surprising. The lobby bar stays open late and many visitors used it. We enjoyed the ambiance of the hotel and have read reviews here which lament the loss of the ambiance when it was the Pan Pacific. We can appreciate that view, but what remains is still an extraordinary hotel in a wonderful location. At these prices for rooms, one has many selections throughout the city, but very few that combine the J.W.Marriott's location, ambiance, cleanliness, service and amenities. We are returning to the San Francisco J.W. Marriott in July of this year, so we'll review our assessment after our second stay. At this point, we have little doubt that it will be just as enjoyable and we will share our pictures thereafter."
84,2107,"Jan 17 2008 	Very comfortable	I stayed at the JW just before Thanksgiving, a veeeery quiet period for the hotel. The room was not remodeled, and will benefit from an updating, but it was clean, well maintained and very comfortable -- particularly the bed and desk chair (and how unusual is that!) The bathroom is marvelous. Unlike some reviewers, I found the service attentive. I don't use hotel services much, but when I asked for assistance, it was prompt and courteous. Did not use the restaurants; the bar was nice, but pricey -- hey, it's SF. Location is great. I usually stay at the SF Marriott on 4th. This is clearly a grade up in style and attention, but both are terrific properties, with wonderful locations. If a first time visitor or someone still doing mostly touristy stuff, I might actually give the edge to the hotel on 4th because of the very close proximity to the Fl ine! If you've been to SF before, choose this one for a touch more luxury."
85,2107,"Jan 17 2008	So nice...	We stayed here for a week in 2006. Fantastic hotel, beds are really comfortable. No complaints!"
86,2107,"Dec 15 2007 	Not what it used to be	I have stayed at this hotel when it was the Pan Pacific Hotel more than a couple dozen of times. I recently stayed there after it became the JW Marriott. I have always loved this hotel. It is a architectural masterpiece. With incredible marble bathrooms, stunning lobby and great rooms this WAS one of the finest hotels in a city full of great hotels. My only problem is with the renovation converting it to a Marriott. Before it was a oasis of class. Now with the changes it has all the charm of a hotel located near a airport. The carpet outside the guest rooms is hideous and loud. Looking down the atrium all you see is this ugly carpet totally distracting from the beautiful design of the building. The only improvement in the rooms is new, larger t.v.s. The new furnishings are bland and basic. Marriott did a excellent job in removing all of the charm and elegance from this hotel. People who have never stayed at this property will most likely love it because it is still a great hotel in a unbeatable location. But for those of us who knew it before the change it is very sad. The interior designer and the executives who approved the new design should be sacked. While I was there the main lobby was closed and being redone. I shudder to think of how Marriott will ruin that formerly beautiful space. So I mourn the loss of a great and beautiful hotel."
87,2107,"Dec 14 2007 	Loved the JW Marriott!	We spent 4 days over the Thanksgiving holiday in San Francisco at the JW Marriott. Being an online travel website editor/content writer here in Hawaii, I spend a great deal of time on TripAdvisor checking out people's reviews of Hawaii hotels so did the same for San Francisco. Four of us flew out of Honolulu on a red-eye and arrived at the hotel at about 7:30 am, bleary-eyed and exhausted. I had called the hotel and requested renovated rooms on a higher floor in the back (after having read various reviews of it being noisy with sirens, etc.), but I never asked for early check-in, but I did mentioned we were flying in on a red-eye. I never expected that either room would be available at that time, but our friends room was, so we could freshen up and leave our luggage there with our connecting room ready by 11 am.The rooms are elegant and beautifully decorated with the classic &quot;wish I had it at home&quot; Marriott bed and bedding. Large flat screen TV, many amenities and one of the most beautiful bathrooms I've ever seen in any hotel. We were on the 14th floor and we never heard any sounds of sirens, etc. and the rooms were extremely quiet and immaculate.But even with all this elegance we agreed the best part of the JW Marriott was the staff, from the bellmen to the front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, housekeeping and valets and every person we met. They smiled, were genuinely friendly and always greeted us, gave some excellent advice on where to eat, made reservations, etc., etc. In Hawaii we speak often of Aloha spirit and it actually is a lovely thing, but we all agreed that we had found real Aloha spirit at the JW Marriott on this trip. Interestingly, many people here told me I would be disappointed in San Francisco as it was dirty, lots of druggies and homeless (I had lived in Palo Alto for 5 years and spent a great deal of time up in the city). I am not sure where these people were, because we all found it super clean, with friendly people, streets very clean and even the homeless we did see were neatly dressed and did not hassle us and we walked everywhere with no problems. Would we go back again - in a millisecond! It's a wonderful hotel with a great staff in an ideal location in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. JW Marriott San Francisco thank you for an unforgettable vacation. And as soon as we can get both airline reservations and hotel we'll be booking again, except for a longer time."
88,2107,"Dec 7 2007 	Loved It	The JW Marriott is the former Pan Pacific Hotel, but has been beautifully updated and refurbished now that it's considered part of the flagship brand for the Marriott chain.This hotel is situated a short walk from Union Square, so location is fantastic. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and luxuriously appointed. The service is spectacular. One thing we really enjoyed during our visit was the very nice breakfast in the dining room, which was included in the package we purchased--very pleasant surroundings, excellent food, and fine service.The JW is an excellent value, and perfect for a romantic getaway in the most lovely city in America."
89,2107,"Dec 6 2007	Not what we thought it would be....	We were really looking forward to our San Francisco vacation and it really was a perfect weekend - except for the hotel. When you think of a 5 star hotel you think service, luxury and proximity. Hmmm....the JW Marriott did not even reach 5 star quality in ANY of these areas. While the rooms were spacious they were completely outdated. It took room service over an hour to get to us and they acted as if I did something wrong. The concierge (Kyle?) was completely off the mark when recommending restaurants. Sounds like it was more based on a kick back than anything else b/c he sent us to some young kids bar at 50 years old!! Checking in was just fine except for the checking out part. You felt as if they couldn't wait to be rid of two people who made absolutely no trouble. I would NEVER stay in a Marriott again - all b/c of this place. Awful, awful, awful...."
90,2107,"Nov 27 2007 	Great Honeymoon	I stayed in SF for the dates of November 4-11, 2007. I was there for my honeymoon. Upon arrival, I was impressed with the staff. The bellhop helped unloaded our bags from the taxi and gave us a claim ticket. Check-in was a breeze. We received an upgrade due to the fact it was our honeymoon. Once in our room, our bags arrived within 10 minutes. As for the room, we were in a newly renovated executive suite with a city view. It was very nice. The room consisted of a large flat screen TV, king size bed, couch, chair, desk, and separate tub and shower. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. One problem I encountered was in the morning when I wanted to take a shower there would be no hot water. I ended up having to take a bath that I was not happy with. I have had the same problem with not having hot water in the morning at other hotels. I got over it. The staff was great at the hotel. We never had to open a door. The bar had great drinks. We enjoyed drinking at the hotel bar better than anywhere else. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown. This was a great location. We did not need a car to get anywhere. I would recommend the JW Marriott to anyone. My husband and I will be returning to SF in 2010 and we definitely will be staying at the JW Marriott."
91,2107,"Nov 23 2007 	Great Hotel	On the final night of our tour of CA, we stayed at the JW in SF. We had asked for a high floor because of other reviews regarding remodeling. As of Nov. 17th - I think only the first 2 floors of rooms were still being remodeled and the manager had told us that the lobby was to begin the following week. The rooms were beautiful and we loved the bathroom. The bathroom had a separate shower and bathtub; the beds were extremely comfortable; flat screen TV; and the room was very spacious. We thought the lobby and bar was nice (2 fireplaces with comfortable chairs around them) -but he had said they were remodeling to make it more contemporary. The staff in this hotel was exceptional delivering anything we needed to our room. The only complaint we had about this hotel was the parking - it was $45 a day. Fortunately for us, we didn't really need our car anymore, so we returned it early instead of paying for the parking. Overall, this was by far the nicest of the 4 Marriott's we stayed at during our trip and was not the most expensive. I would definitely recommend this to anyone going to SF."
92,2107,"Nov 23 2007 	Very Dissapointed	My husband and I stayed numerous times at the Marriott in San Francisco located at 55 fourth street in SF. We always enjoyed our stay there!We were not impressed with the staff at the JW Marriott When we arrived we carried our own luggage inside the building ,While staff members watched .Oh they did open our car door. We placed our bags on a bell mans cart,Then a staff member ran up handed us a claim ticket and shooed us away.We then went up to check in that was pleasant . We then went to our room we wanted to freshen up before our meeting ,The room way nice but had been freshly painted the outside balcony still had a large amount of plastic where they were still painting.We had to wait almost a half hour for our bags to be brought up to the room. The bellman insisted he receive a tip he just stood there ,Of course we tipped him. As a matter of fact ,All the Staff were so pushy for tips even for a bucket of ice (the hotel wouldn't allow us to get it ourselves) We stayed two nights at this Jw Marriott .We tipped to the tune of almost $250.00 to this pushy lazy staff. The bed linens were Not changed and were clearly soiled,The maid also did not vacuum or wipe anything down ,We were happy just to receive clean tiles. My husband works for the Government (The hotel would not honor any discount ) That was okay ,We also own a Rare Coin and Jewelry Company ,It was the principal of the matter. I am also disabled and at the other Marriott at 55 fourth street ,I was not charged for handicap parking .This hotel charged us approx. $88.00 a night. When we arrived back to the hotel the second night of our stay the valet parking attendant rudely stated he thought we had checked out??? What an insult ,I explained to him we were staying two nights . He rudely gave us another claim ticket for our auto. I then went inside to talk to someone at the front desk ,Their was a young dark haired Asian man there, He also was nasty, All I wanted to do was make sure we were Still booked for two nights ? He told me yes ,Then I asked about the parking situation with handicapped parking ? He stated Each Marriott was independently owned and operated and their Hotel Valet was Separately ran and they had nothing to do with Valet (what)...I then had valet bring our auto back we moved it to the corner where their was a handicap parking on the street. upon checking out that next day we carried our own bags down ,I waited for my husband to get the car ,While I waited I could hear the Valet parking attendants laughing goofing off. I wanted to go back in and talk to someone at the check in desk ,But after the Nasty Rude person I spoke to the night before I was frankly a little Scared to. After my husband brought the car round four of the valet parking attendants ran over to open the doors really pushy ,My guess is they wanted More Tips.Hum maybe because they were holding their hands out with their palms up?When we received our bill for a regular room two nights stay ,We were charged two nights valet parking even though we moved the car. The bill came to $880.00 without any room service or anything else.Wow I don't ever want to pay to be treated this way again.I did make a call after we returned back home to Reno Nv. I spoke to someone who was very kind ,However it had been over 24 hours and he could not adjust the bill.. Please everyone Beware!"
93,2107,"Oct 30 2007	Wonderful hotel!	I stayed here for a big conference on 10/26- 10/29 and was very impressed with the hotel. I paid $239 for a king bed through the conference. When I got there, I tried for a free upgrade but was granted only a &quot;remodeled&quot; room. However, as it turned out, it was wonderful. I will now review by category.Hotel: For those that don't know, this used to be the Pan Pacific hotel. It is located about 1 block from Union Square and is within walking distance to many nice restaurants and shops. You do need to take the elevator to the lobby.Room: I ended up with a remodeled &quot;corner&quot; room on the 10th floor. It was a wonderful looking room and was more spacious than most. I have never stayed in this hotel and don't know what to expect from the other rooms, but I was really happy with it. The bathroom was nice but only offered a shower. The bed was wonderful and had a down pillow top thingy over the mattress that made it wonderful. It had a big plasma TV and desk with a very very comfortable chair. I sat in that chair all the time. My room had two closes and a bar area as well. There looked to be a place for a fridge, but no fridge was found. Service: Very nice. I was there for 4 days and only opened the front door of the hotel a couple of times. There were always people there to do it and call a cab as well. The butler service was interesting and I only used it for a bucket of ice. There was nightly turn down service that would also fill up the ice bucket. My only complaint was that there were only 4 elevators in the whole hotel and sometimes required a short wait. All in all, it was a wonderful stay. Would definately return in the future."
94,2107,"Oct 3 2007 	Metropolitan Luxury??? Not until the renovations are complete!!!!	I have stayed in many a JW and have always been satisfied with the rooms but lemme tell you, if you are planning on staying hereDEMAND a renovated room or a huge discount!! I can only blame myself for requesting a very early check-in  the only room available for early check in was on a low floor...exhausted I acceptedI was never told the room was not renovated. The room was clean, and typical but NOT A JW!!! The only reason I didnt complain is due to the fact the room had the JW bed and beddings, Bose radio and a plasma screen TV  aside from that. NOTHING in the room was reminiscent of a JW. The carpet was worn, the furniture was dilapidated, the finish on the sink and bath tub were actually cracking and peeling! I think I got a mini derma-abrasion from the rough towels provided. I recognized the bath products from a Hilton Garden Inn I stayed in last week I never found the mini-barThe in room coffee maker was inadequate.. no name coffee with powdered creamer How can sister hotel Ritz Carlton have such a fine coffee set up with Brand name coffees &amp; real cream and JW get play-school props?? Amazing!!! When I tried to use the complementary town car service, I was told by the driver his trunk was full and could not accommodate by belongings strange as I was his only passenger?! I must give this hotel props though the location cannot be beatthe staffalthough they neglected to alert me that the room was an old Pan Pacific room, were very accommodating and pleasant. The common areas were beautiful as are the renovated rooms ..Should you be lucky enuf to secure one."
95,2107,"Sep 5 2007 	Great 4-Star Luxury Hotel	I stayed two nights in August, 2007 at this hotel. I was very pleased with everything. ROOM: I was assigned one of the renovated rooms and it was beautiful, quiet, comfortable, spacious, and had lots of ammenities like separate shower and tub, electronic laptop safe, large functional desk, and large flat screen TV. The bed was outstanding as were the linens, pillows, and duvet. SERVICE: Service was excellent throughout my stay. There is a button on the wall in your room that you can push for just about any request. Someone appears at your door in a few moments - - service was efficient and fast. Every staff member I encountered was very polite and helpful. FITNESS: The hotel has a very nice fitness center with great equipment. CONCIERGE LOUNGE: The concierge lounge provides an excellent extended continental breakfast. TIP: the lounge gets crowded so I recommend you show up for breakfast early.LOCATION: The location is great - - right off Union Square behind the Westin St. Francis.RENOVATIONS: Although this hotel is going through a total renovation, you hardly notice it. I was impressed with how quiet the workers were. They hardly made any noise and certainly had no effect on my enjoyable stay. They are closing one floor at a time for renovations starting at the top and working down. I think the top 5 or 6 floors are done. The lobby is scheduled for renovation beginning in November. VALUE: This is not the most luxe, beautiful, or celebrated hotel in S.F. but it's an excellent choice and an excellent value when you consider that its rates are 1/2 or less than those at some of the 5-Star luxury hotels nearby. I've stayed at some of these hotels and they are amazing but I think the J.W. Marriott matches most of their quality and services at a much lower cost. Highly recommended."
96,2107,"Aug 30 2007	A Bit Disappointed	Must say that we were a bit disappointed with this Marriott property. When we were checking in guests on either side of us were arguing about their reservation. We had made a standard reservation for myself, my wife and our daughter. The room they gave us had a king bed with no room for a roll-away. The only solution was to pay for an upgrade to a small suite. The hotel is centrally located in the business district although the neighborhood did not feel that comfortable in the evening. The reception is on the third floor which is not the most convenient and the parking at $45 per night is steep. The room was a little worn but the hotel is undergoing renovations."
97,2107,"Aug 28 2007	Definitely!	Great location, easy check-in, easy check-out, clean, comfortable, beyond inviting, just-right fitness center, knowledegable staff &amp; the fun is in the details! Would definitely do it again."
98,2107,"Aug 24 2007 	Attentive staff nice amenities	We had a wonderful time at the J.W. Marriott. The staff was top rate, very attentive. For e.g., when we checked in, the computer showed our room was not ready but the staff went to the room personally to check on it and found that it was ready, saving us the wait. I asked for extra hangers for the closet and they were delivered in a matter of minutes. The hotel is in a nice location, and has great amenities inc. their concierge room. We stayed in a room not yet renovated, but still very clean and pleasant."
99,2107,"Jul 30 2007	Great hotel near Union Square	We just got back from San Francisco. My husband attended a conference at the hotel and I joined him with our 18-month old son. The hotel is very nice and should be positively fabulous once the renovation is complete. The service is excellent! The concierge was terrific, providing maps, directions and wonderful dining suggestions. The door was always held open for us when we left and returned. We had a very nice room on the 13th floor with very comfy beds. (Now I know I need a new mattress at home!)"
100,2107,"Jul 29 2007 	Great hotel - fantastic location!	Stayed at this hotel in March for 3 nights, and I really enjoyed my stay. I was upgraded to a spacious corner room, which had a small sitting area, flat screen TV, and Bose radio. Incredibly comfortable bed and nice shower. Service was outstanding, but the best part is the location. About a block from Union Square and tons of shopping! They also have a complimentary car service, which I used one night meeting a friend for dinner. I would highly recommend this hotel, and would probably stay here again.Extras: If you like Greek food, there is a fantastic restaurant called &quot;Kokari's&quot; which has some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Great ambiance, service and food. It's not cheap, but it's worth it."
101,2107,"Jul 27 2007 	Great time at a great hotel in a great location with comfy beds!	My husband and I stayed at the JW Marriott for 4 nights. The hotel is located only a couple of blocks from Union Square and a mere 10 min cab ride to Pier 39. The rooms are a bit small, and a little out dated, but we didn't spend much time in the room so that was ok. The beds are really comfy and cozy. Our room was on the 8th floor (813) and our window was overlooking Post Street. It can be quite noisy from the traffic (especially for us since we are from the desert and never hear traffic ever). The noise usually dies down around 10pm (later on the weekends) and then starts back up again arond 5am. If you aren't used to the noise, you may want to ask for a room on a higher floor or a room that is not located directly on Post Street. I think the one great thing that sets this hotel apart from others is the staff. They are remarkable! Very friendly, very accomodating and very helpful. We only ate breakfast at the restaurant located in the hotel, and it was pretty good. For about $20 you can get the breakfast buffet with fresh fruit, pastries, bagels, cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes etc. All in all we had a great time and would definetely stay here again (sounds like the hotel is going to be pretty posh after the remodel too)."
102,2107,"Jul 27 2007 	Great hotel	I stayed at the Pan Pacific for 4 days in May of 2005 while attending a Diabetes Technology Conference. The hotel is lovely and the staff were friendly and very helpful. My room was a double queen. It was a lovely room, very clean, posh bathroom, housekeeping was excellent. The local is ideal for exploring the city.I would stay here again."
103,2107,"Jul 24 2007 	Relaxing stay!	Just had a fantastic 9 nights at the JW Marriott in SFO. We arrived pretty late (around midnight) after what seemed an eternity of flying/passport control/delays and the first thing that strikes you about this hotel is how friendly, courteous and efficient ALL the staff are! During our stay, our very nice hire car was treated with the utmost respect by the valet, the hotel doors were always opened for you (and the one time it wasn't the doorman apologised!), the check-in and check-out was seamless, room service was prompt with very good food and the concierge was particularly knowledgeable and loaded us up with informative maps of the city and Napa valley.The hotel is in a fairly central location; not far from the crowds of Union Square, but far enough not to hear the bells of the cable cars which begin in nearby Powell Street. The hotel rooms are well appointed with plenty of space, and are light and airy. There is no double-glazing on the street-facing windows, so unfortunately there is quite a lot of noise. For some reason San Francisco is beseeched by constant fire trucks and although we never saw any smoke, you'd think the city was burning down some nights! As mentioned in other people's reviews of this hotel, the bathroom is a little dated and a bit too gaudy for early in the morning, but everything worked and supplies were stocked daily. It was nice to have a cup of freshly brewed coffee from the machine supplied. It's little things like this (and having an ironing board and iron in every room) that help when you're away from home for a while!We managed to get a good rate ($239) but still thought that internet access should be included. It is expensive at nearly $13 per night, but at least this does include unlimited local and long distance US calls which is a nice touch (no more $5 charge to phone for take out!)."
104,2107,"Jul 18 2007 	Superior hotel. Great service great location top notch all around.	Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. This hotel is a notch above the rest. The service is unbelievable. You need dinner reservations at a restaurant perfectly suited for your mood? No problem. Great theatre seats? Piece of cake. The staff is falling over themselves in an effort to make your stay more pleasant. The rooms are extremely nice. This hotel easily surpasses the average Westin, Intercontinental, etc. I can't recommend this hotel enough. You will love it."
105,2107,"Jul 17 2007 	JW Marriott - Nice but not perfect	Just returned from 5 night stay at the JW near Union Square. Originally had been booked into the Parc 55, but found out they are no longer part of Marriott. Not willing to give up 5 nights of points, we changed hotels. Check in was smooth. The entire hotel is undergoing a reno over the next 6-9 months and the new design looks great. Very vibrant and sophisticated. Our assigned room was nice but not yet redone. Good size for a big city hotel. Small flat screen tv was nice. Bathroom was spacious and covered with brown marble, but a bit dated. Apparently part of the decor from the former asian theme hotel chain. Room did not have access to refrigeration which is always so great to have. Also the bedside lighting was poor due to the energy saving fluorescent ring bulbs. Housekeeping was a bit of a weak spot as well. After 4 days, I finally called to ask for my shower stall to be treated for mildew. It was overlooked each day. Used the Concierge Lounge a few times in the morning and in the evening. Very nice breakfast options and sweets for dessert after dinner. Always so nice to have access to. Used the airport shuttle service arranged by hotel concierge for trip to airport. Worked just fine and saved money for sure. We will be back!"
106,2107,"Jul 16 2007 	Best hotel in San Francisco	Every aspect of our stay was nothing short of perfect. If I could give six stars I would . And if it wasn't perfect to begin with it was fixed immediately. Two of the windows in our gorgeous room (corner overlooking Union Square) didn't close properly and the engineer came up and fixed them right away. We asked for a fridge for the room - again delivered immediately. Extra pillows, no problem. More coffee, no problem. Our room was spotless and well appointed. The bed was comfortable - lighting was good, great work space and the bathrooms are fabulous. In fact, we were surprised to find out the hotel was in the middle of a remodel. Every request was kindly answered from how often the cable cars ran to asking the concierge at 5:30pm on Saturday evening if he knew of a place to get a manicure late and out of thin air he found one around the corner open until 7:30pm. Fantastic! The hotel was at high occupancy and we didn't hear noise from other guests or see any service issues - again - everything perfect. We had an amazing dinner at the restaurant in the lobby. The gentleman that served us went above and beyond to meet every request including helping us negotiate the menu for our son who is allergic to egg. He had the kitchen prepare special chicken nuggets for him. (We have NEVER had any hotel or dining place go to the effort of creativity.) Our son was captivated by the inside elevator and beautiful fountain in the lobby. My husband and my meals rivaled those of our favorite places to eat. We found out later that it's one of the best places to eat in San Francisco. Room service was incredible -- right on time and everything delicious. Our little guy thought the Disney on demand (little Einstein's and Mickey mouse) in the room was terrific and didn't want to go home. In fact, it was heard to tear him from the room watching the traffic and Union Square from the window so we will definitely be back. The hotel is one block from the cable car line down to Fisherman's wharf. It's right off of Union Square and the location is the best place to be in San Francisco."
107,2107,"Jul 8 2007 	Very impressed!! Great stay!!	Stayed over on July 4th weekend for one night and was very pleased. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 3pm but were quickly upgraded to a large suite!! Our room had 2 beautiful bathrooms, queen bed, sleeper sofa, kitchen area, office area and so much more. For a family of 4 it beats sharing one room with 2 double beds anytime!! The service at the front desk was fine and my kids loved the bowl of apples that were always out for the taking. Valet parking was great and when we parked our car and needed to grab a cab in a rush we were offered the hotels car service instead for no charge!! Now that is service!!Our package included breakfast for 2 at the buffet in the morning and although it was not a huge spread everything was very tasty and nicely presented. Service was a tad slow but I am also an impatient person :)All in all I would recommend this hotel without hesitation."
108,2107,"Jul 8 2007	Kyle the Super Concierge	Got a great last-minute deal on Travelocity for 3 nights at the JW Marriot with airfare over the July 4 holiday. Very content with this hotel upon arrival and throughout my stay. Is it ultra modern and sexy? No. Is it the hot spot in town? No. Is it extra plush? Nah. But what it does have is an elegant lobby, super friendly staff and clean comfy rooms. My room was on the 16th floor with a nice city view. You can tell that with a little elbow grease via the current renovation this hotel will be something special. A few scruffs on walls and on furniture didn't take away from the overall airy rooms and open feel of the space. All slight aesthetic tarnishes are trumped by the service. Amazing. From the doorman to room service to reception. The biggest delight of my stay at the JW Marriot was a terrific conciege by the name of Kyle. His good humor and excellent, patient advice helped me throughout my solo trip in a new city. From tips on how to brave the 4th of July crowds at Pier 39 to off-the-beaten path restaurants in The Castro and Filmore, this guy's suggestions and recommendations were top-notch and really helped me navigate the city. Kyle is a gem. Kudos to him and everyone at the JW. I'd stay again."
109,2107,"Jul 3 2007	Wonderful stay - Would return in a heartbeat!	I stayed here for one night, and was told it used to be the Pan Pacific Hotel which retained some of its asian themes. The bed and feather-pillows were luxurious and very comfortable. Complimentary robes were given and they even had a phone in the bathroom. Caution, don't push the button in the bathroom, unless you want the conceirge to call you! There was a turn-down service, which was nice. The service is impeccable, the staff was friendly &amp; helpful. I liked the location of the hotel, which is very close to all the shopping you need. For cocktails, hit up the Redroom, which has a classy bar-lounge atmosphere. I stayed with a friend, but this hotel could serve nicely as a family or romantic getaway. You can't beat the location. Park at the Union Street Garage which is a short walk away. I would definitely return to this hotel."
110,2107,Jul 2 2007 	Nice Rooms	Stayed here with clients. Staff was courteous and accommodating. Beds were extremely comfortable. Bose radio was amazing. Could use some updates and a larger LCD TV but I was told a major renovation will be happening in 2007.
111,2107,"Jun 26 2007 	Great Stay!	We just completed a week long stay at the JW Marriott San Francisco from 6/18-6/25. Overall, the hotel was nice and very clean. The doormen were extremely nice and helpful with getting directions or a taxicab. The concierge was also very helpful with assisting us in planning our days site seeing events. The hotel is located pretty much around the corner from Union Square and all the shopping a girl could ever ask for! The hotel has a lovely restaurant that, though pricey, is very tastey. Room service is prompt and friendly. So overall a good stay. There were only few things we were unhappy about were, the beds were kind of soft, so I woke up with a backache and a neckache from the equally soft pillows. Also slightly inconvenient was the false fire alarms that went off twice during the night while we were sound asleep. I can't say I would stay here again because I probably wont go back to San Francisco, but I didn't see another hotel in the city that I woud have rather stayed at. Sorry, we didn't take photos of the hotel or room, but the photos on the website are accurate."
112,2107,"Jun 21 2007 	Don't trust the reviews!	We stayed at the JW Marriott San Francisco from June 15-17, 2007 and were very impressed! After reading the trip advisor reviews, I was sorry that Priceline had accepted our bid ($89) and very nervous as we had 3 rooms booked for a graduation.After we parked at the parking lot across the street (thanks reviewers), we were greeted at the front desk without a wait and given rooms on the 38th floor (the View lounge is on the 39th). The reviewers who stated that priceline customers were treated with little respect were wrong on our account. The view from our room was awesome of the Bay Bridge and beyond.The room was very clean (I'm very picky) and well decorated, the gym fantastic, Starbucks in the lobby very convenient and the &quot;View Lounge&quot; beautiful with great service and view of the entire city. The location is fantastic (close to Union Square shopping)! The coffee service in the room was broken and a new one was brought up within 5 minutes on a busy Saturday morning.We will return to this wonderful property and hope that Marriott accepts our Priceline bid in the future."
113,2107,"Jun 21 2007 	Recommended	We reserved a room with 2 queen beds for 4 girls to share. When we arrived, they only had a room with 1 king bed, so they gave us another room with a king for 1/2 price. They also gave us free parking for the mix-up, which was a nice bonus considering the usual price. Parking is $50 a night, but I had rented an SUV - $80 a night for oversized vehicles!! WOW!! There is a much cheaper parking garage just a block down the street - they can direct you to it. Anyhow, we were very pleased with our 2 rooms. Typical Marriott rooms. Good size and very comfortable. We decided to splurge on the breakfast buffet. It's expensive, but good. The bar/restaurant at the top has great views. The hotel is in a great location for shopping and restaurants. Highly recommended."
114,2107,"Jun 11 2007 	Don't bother.	Don't expect the quality of the usual JW Marriott brand. This hotel is starting to undergo renovations and until completed, is currently like any worn-out Marriott. Decor is dated, rooms are unattractive- old, worn funiture, minibars have been removed. Basically, it's a tired hotel with no luxuries. Staff are pleasant, but not particularly attentive for a 4 star property. Location is close to Union Square. You can do better for the price."
115,2107,"Jun 1 2007 	Nice Hotel	The Hotel was nice, but really not a WOW factor like many says. Valet Parking was expensive; I used a parking lot around the corner for far less. We didn't eat much at the hotel but for the two times we did we used room service, and ate a nice Asian restaurant located in the lobby at the rear of the hotel; food was good both times. Though a few streets away from major crime area, like anywhere where you find clubs, hotel is near Union Square and shopping. Visitors center located near the hotel go purchase Cable Car tickets."
116,2107,"May 6 2007 	Nice Hotel Nice Location	This is a nice hotel in a nice location. I would say though, that it is barely &quot;above&quot; average, only because there is nothing really special about it. The rooms are nice, and the bathrooms roomy. My husband doesn't care for the pedestal sink and feels there was a shortage of counter space - but I found the shelves useful instead. Like all hotels, not enough outlets in the bathroom. Nice mirror, nice seperate tub and shower, and a tv. Comfortable bed and linens. What I didn't like was the lounge area. Very cold, not fun to sit and have a cocktail and visit there. The location of this hotel is excellent. Probably for SF the price is reasonable, but given the choice I might stay at the Donatello next time (right next door) for the decor and price. Like staying at Marriotts in general to get my rewards points, but a little pricey for the ammenities provided. Overall a nice experience, not particularly romantic, would stay again but might stay somewhere else."
117,2107,"Apr 16 2007 	Honeymoon	Enjoyed staying here but not a wow factor hotellocation great,not a great hotel for a honeymoon - should have went elsewherewould recommend it for other travellers but not honeymooners"
118,2107,"Apr 7 2007 	Would definitely return!	By the time I had reached this hotel, I had been to four different cities and was grouchy and warn out. The staff, right from the door man to the room service staff were outstanding. This property used to be a Pan Pacific Hotel, one of my personal favorites, so I knew I couldn't go too wrong here. The rooms were a very good size and unusually positioned with a hallway in and the bathroom around the corner. The bathrooms were plush with all the amenities you expect in an upper scale hotel, such as a separate shower, high end products and two robes of different weight (and size). There was an LCD television. Upon arrival, on the 3rd floor, at check-in there was a beverage set-up with fresh fruit water. I tried the restaurant and room service and actually preferred the room service as there was more selection! The staff is probably the best part of this hotel. Eager to go out of their way to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I had shopped and knew I would never fit my purchases in my already overstuffed suicase, so the concierge FedEx'd my purchases to my home! outstanding. The hotel is conveniently located about a block or so away from the shopping mecca of Union Square. I cannot wait to return."
119,2107,Apr 2 2007 	About to be Renovated but still good	Spent 3 nights here and have no complaints. Sign outside says the hotel is about to start a major renovation so watch out for that. Rooms are tastefully decorated but some of the furniture is a bit battered. Comfortable beds. Bathrooms are maybe not to everybody's taste but they are a decent size and certainly don't lack for marble.Service was very good. Had one dinner at the restaurant - food was pretty good (if pricey) but they place was almost deserted and around8:15pm they started to clear tables and set up for breakfast. Location is great but there a a LOT of homeless in San Francisco including around this area. Would recommend this hotel.
120,2107,"Mar 29 2007 	Absolutely loved it!	We escaped here after originally planning to stay at the Rex, which we found to be way below par when we booked in. We loved the room, which was a little small but very comfortable, and really loved the huge bathroom, with separate shower cubicle and deep bath. The concierge was very helpful, the doormen charming and we just felt like this hotel had things spot on. Very comfy beds, too...we would definitely stay here again. I'm not sure what the breakfast is like in the hotel as we like to go out when we're on holiday so no comment there..."
121,2107,"Mar 5 2007	Comfort In The City By The Bay	It is easy to leave one's heart in San Francisco, especially if you book a room at the JWM at current rates.First, the location is ideal. One can easily take the Bay Area Rapid Transport (&quot;BART&quot;) from SFO for $5.15 and arrive at the Powell Street station, emerging from the subway right smack dab in the thick of the The City where Powell meets Market Street. Roll with the good times up hill a few blocks past Union Square to the JWM and check in with a friendly desk clerk at the third floor lobby, which is a bit dark but serene.One of four glass enclosed elevators will come quickly to fetch you from the lobby and take you up to one of 22 or so floors, down a hall that is light and airy, to a room that is clean, bright, comfortable and well appointed. The room features a king bed with soft sheets and a fantastic assortment of pillows, from soft to firm, short to long, down-filled to polyester; I counted at least six. I was impressed, particularly since hotels far too often overlook or skimp on this essential ingredient for a good night's rest.The room has a good working thermostat, wet bar, small fridge, Bose clock-radio (but alas no CD player), coffee maker, flat screen television (but alas a small one), and cotton robes (but alas no slippers). The carpet looks good and crown molding adds a nice touch, but some of the furniture is dated. The window treatments were effective and the windows actually open, but they are not double-paned or noise proof. The bathroom is well laid out with attractive fixtures, mirrors and marble. There is a separate glass shower, a full length tub, myriad toiletries, and plenty of towels.Maid service in the morning and turn-down in the evening were exceptional. On the topic of service, the JWM folks I met were friendly and response time for ice from room service (since there are no ice making machines) was stellar.There is an adequate gym for working out on the 5th Floor with televisions, complimentary towels, water bottles and apples. There is no sauna, jacuzzi or pool (got to go to the Ritz Carlton or the Nikko for those features).Following the major redo of this property which I am told is underway, I would expect room rates to rise as well. For now, at about $190 per room (for the 360 square foot version), a few nights here will, along with all the other great sights, sounds, and tastes of The City, go a long way towards stealing your heart...."
122,2107,"Mar 5 2007 	Pink marble everywhere!	My overwhelming memory of this hotel are the bathrooms which are really so naff they should be granted some sort of historical preservation order. Pink marble, gaudy fittings - incredible. The problem is you keep spotting the same pink marble elsewhere in the hotel and this leaves you deeply traumatised. The good news is the hotel is about to have a 36m dollar makeover - hopefully the bathrooms are top priority. Pink marble aside it's a nice place if a bit dated. The big, open lobby is intimate enough to enjoy pre dinner drinks. Breakfast service is friendly and efficient as is the valet parking. The central location, just by Union Sq. makeS this an ideal place to stay to enjoy Downtown and restaurants but just be careful not to wander into Tenderloin which is very nearby - we did and felt threatened and vulnerable ( we were jostled and called white trash)."
123,2107,"Mar 3 2007	Great location	We stayed at the JW for two nights last week and enjoyed the Union Square location. The hotel lobby is attractive with a nice restaurantfor breakfast with a good buffet. The rooms are abit dated, but comfortable. We had a kingsize with city view, the bathroom was spacious and modern. They didn't restock our mini bar or our toiletries without us calling, but you do have a personal butler available. Hertz rental is available within the hotel. We rented a car and drove an hour or so into Napa Valley, Sonoma and on to Carmel during our week in California."
124,2107,"Feb 5 2007	A Perfect Stay	My boyfried and I stayed here this past weekend for a long weekend away from the cold of NYC. We had a fabulous stay. The room was quite spacious given the price of the room and the service was excellent. The morning Concierge (Andrea) was wonderful and planned a trip that was amazing for us. I would stay away from the evening Concierge (Kyle? I think) b/c he really didn't listen to what we were looking for but Andrea rocked! The only thing I found unnerving was the fact that there are mirrors EVERYWHERE in the bathroom - you could watch yourself showering, taking a bath, brushing one's teeth and other unmentionable acts. Losing a few mirrors would be helpful. But that's a minor issue. I am extremely picky and was pleasantly surprised at this place - especially after reading a comment below that said it looks &quot;dated&quot; to &quot;worn.&quot; If you want something modern and new then go spend the money at the St. Regis or Hotel Palomar. You definitely get what you pay for here: a comfortable bed, great service, and a positive stay."
125,2107,"Jan 29 2007 	Loved It !	Am a local, but we wanted to spend the night in the city. This hotel has excellent service. Everyone was wonderful and very helpful. The rooms were awesome. Nicely decorated and very clean. The bathroom was huge and had everything you could possibly want. I highly recommend this hotel for everyone. The hotel is within walking distance of Union Square and the downtown shopping areas."
126,2107,"Jan 28 2007 	Nice hotel but bathroom although gorgeous could use improvement	The hotel service was excellent, and no complaints. My visit was for business, and my associate and I were booked into adjoining rooms on the 10th floor. There was no view, but we had a government rate, and a view was not why we were there. The rooms were large and comfortable, and the robes were plush. The bathroom, although gorgeous, were problematic. I am fairly short (5' 2&quot;) and most of the counter space was a backsplash-sized ledge behind a large Kohler sink. It was difficult for me to reach most of my things over the sink. More bathroom counter space would have been nice, and I would have gladly given up the tv for the space. Similarly, the shower was tiny, even for someone my size. I am under 120 pounds, but I found the shower small and confining. (I hoped I did not drop the soap because there wasn't much room to bend down and pick it up!) The water pressure was also not that good. I would have preferred using the tub (which had a hand-held shower), but there was no curtain. I would stay here again, but for the fact the bathrooms (a major concern when I stay) were not as functional as I want."
127,2107,"Jan 21 2007	Great Room!	Stayed at this hotel when it was the Pan Pacific. The room was luxurious for the price. Most comfortable bed I've slept in. The bathroom was all marble with a tv and bathtub. The hotel itself is on the quieter side, no nightlife in the lobby but good for a relaxing stay."
128,2107,"Jan 10 2007 	Great Place and Location	Having read the reviews for several major chain hotels on this website, we finally decided on JW Marriott. We were not disappointed. Location was great, just 1 block from Union Square and the cable car stop. Quiet location and handy to restaurants. We walked from the BART station at Powell St although uphill it was not that bad!. The hotel is due for refurbishment in Spring 2007. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The front desk was helpful and friendly. We would stay here again."
129,2107,"Jan 7 2007 	Great stay and location	I read all the reviews before hand and we have stayed at the Ritz Carlton twice before so our expectations were high! We weren't disappointed. It was my wife's birthday and I booked a Romance Package which included a nicely appointed room, champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries, and a buffet breakfast. All for just over $200 a night! Sure the valet $42.00 a day parking is stiff but its the big city. The location; a short block to Union Square shopping, a half block to Currant Theater and all the best resturants within easy walking distance. The buffet breakfast was simple and well done plus you can order eggs, pancakes or waffels your way, no extra charge. Service was impeccable and courteous. The Ritz is a super place to stay but its away from shopping and resturants and twice the price at best! Plus its a steep walk to Union Square and a mountain walking back for us fifty year young people. Marriott JW would be my vote if your going to the City by the Bay"
130,2107,"Jan 4 2007 	Great location 	My wife and I stayed at the Marriott from Dec 27 - January 2. The location cannot be beat. Only one block from Union Square. Being a smaller hotel (about 400 rooms) the front desk staff recognized us by name, and was an example of the difference between a smaller hotel versus the 1,000 + room San Francisco Marriott on 4th and Mission St.The hotel management took great efforts to keep the noise down on New Years eve, and even posted extra security in the lobby. We felt very comfortable and safe in this hotel.Service was excellent. Everyone welcomed us with a greeting and a smile."
131,2107,"Jan 2 2007 	No Problems	I stayed at this location many times when it was the Pan Pacific but this was my first visit since it has become JW Marriott. I was a little leery do to some of the other reviews, but had a great stay. No complaints, whatsoever. Cleanliness, service and rooms were all great. Looks as if they are planning a renovation for later this year, so things should only get better."
132,2107,"Dec 31 2006 	Good stay at the Marriott	My wife and I stayed at the Pan Pacific several years ago, before it became the JW Marriott, and we were very happy with our stay. For the most part, Marriott continues the tradition. The bed was large and comfortable, the view was good and the service was excellent. The only problem was that the walls seemed to be very thin and every morning we could hear our &quot;neighbors&quot; who had 2 children. The father would talk on his phone and the children would scream, yell and run around; all this would start at about 7AM. Marriott would be well advised to invest in some sound insulation of some sort or keep families with children near each other. The location is only one block from the center of union square, which should be a key point in choosing a hotel in San Francisco. We like the JW Marriott, but we love the Pan Pacific."
133,2107,"Dec 31 2006 	JW Marriott is nice but a bit dated.	The JW was very nice as described by other reviewers. Bathroom was marble, things were clean, room was large for SF, etc. Downside is that the room did feel a bit worn and dated. The furniture is nicked and a bit old; even the paint color (peach) seemed a bit dated. Nothing major and it doesn't detract from your stay, but we noticed it. Apparently, the hotel is going to be renovated in Spring 2007, which will help. Other things were as expected of a JW Marriott: staff was very nice and helpful; bellmen hailed cabs for us; room was very quiet; etc. Conceirge was pretty much absent due to the xmas holiday, but the front desk staff was provided directions, etc, so it wasn't a bit deal. Location is excellent in Union Square-- close to the cable car at Powell St, and bus and BART lines on Market St. Overall, however, I was more impressed by my stay at the Hotel Monaco in September 2004-- (we were upgraded to a suite, so the comparison is not entirely apt) it's newer and feels more special than did the JW Marriott."
134,2107,"Dec 30 2006	Wonderful 10th Anniversary	My husband and I visited the J.W. Marriott November 11th-15th to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We greatly enjoyed our stay. The service was outstanding from the front desk to the valet. The valet staff was particularly helpful. They ensured that we always knew where we were going when we left the hotel and always warmly welcomed us back upon each return.This hotel has a very good location. It is within walking distance to many of the city's attractions and restaurants. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was phenomenal. The other special touches provided by the hotel such as wine and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us upon our arrival, made our stay very special. We will definitely stay here upon our next return to San Francisco.This is not hotel related, but I would not recommend renting a vehicle unless you plan to venture further than the city of San Fran. We rented a vehicle and then ended up riding the BART to most locations. The BART was easy to use and very convenient. A welcome break from driving."
135,2107,"Dec 5 2006 	JW was superb	This was the first time that my girlfriend and I stayed in SF and we were unsure as to whether to stay at Fishermans Wharf or Union Sq. We decided on Union Sq. based on feedback on TripAdvisor and it was absolutely the correct decision. The area felt very safe both day and night which was important to us both.We were delighted with the JW, the location was perfect, walking distance to all the shopping and restaurants around the Square (a 2 minute walk), the Cable Car and to Chinatown. Market St is about a 5-10 minute walk and there is loads of good shopping there too. It costs $10 maximum to get to Fishermans Wharf and there were always cabs available outside the hotel even over Thanksgiving when I imagine it is busier than usual. The hotel is also very near to all the car rental companies which was also really useful to us.The hotel itself was perfect  we paid $179 a night and stayed on the 18th floor with a fantastic south-facing view. The room was great, a decent size, immaculate, quiet and had everything that you could need (you shouldnt spend too much time in your room in this City anyway)The staff couldnt have been more friendly and helpful. At the Concierge desk, Kyle Yergensen is worthy of a special mention for all the spot-on advice he gave us with regard to drinking and dining; a real credit to the hotel.We will absolutely stay here again when we return to San Francisco and I think the 100 a night rate is about right."
136,2107,Nov 8 2006 	Great Hotel in San Fran	We were impressed with the hotel's architecture. The room was standard but the bathroom was lovely. The hotel was close to shopping and restaurants. We would stay here again in San Francisco.
137,2107,"Oct 18 2006	Fabulous!!	I don't know why others have left bad reviews, our stay at the JW in October was perfect. Our room was gorgeous, the carpet looked new, the bathroom was also very new. The only thing I can say is that some of the furniture had dings in it, but it did not affect the quality of our holiday. The bed was very clean and comfortable, the room was sizeable and very nice and quiet. Great location for Union Square shoppers and very attentive service. No complaints!! A little expensive, but what's a holiday for?"
138,2107,"Oct 15 2006 	Not up to Marriott Standards (JW or not.)	I have to agree with the author below. This hotel is not even close to even regular Marriott standards. It is very dated particularly the rooms . The carpeting is something out of the 1970's and is worn and in need of replacement. The bathroom vent appeared burnt and had a disgusting look to it. The shower, which was freestanding glass enclosed badly needed regrouting. Water pressure was slow in the bathroom sink. You can see where this is going. Better bet for the money is The SF Marriott on 4th Street or the new Hilton on Kearny- both properties are very good having stayed at both numerous times. Hopefully someone at Marriott will see this and get going on getting this hotel up to snuff as it does have a lot of potential."
139,2107,"Oct 11 2006 	Just Average	The JW Marriott San Francisco was a bit of a disappointment given the strong reputation the property had under its previous owner, the Pan Pacific.There's nothing wrong with the hotel--its clean enough, in a good location, with a staff that tries well enough. But there's nothing special, either. In short, the place just seems kind of dated, worn. Its hard to point the finger at any one thing, but the lobby decor and the large atrium seem a bit out of place for this kind of hotel. The rooms itself are plainly decorated. My request for a high floor with a view was NOT accomodated despite elevated Marriott status. Instead, I was given a larger room, which was indeed roomy enough. The bathroom size was a major plus, though the mirrors all over is a bit disconcerting (you don't really need to be looking at yourself doing EVERYTHING!).The bed was NOT comfortable at all. This property does not have Marriott's Revive bedding, and the mattress was stiff and firm. My back ached after one night. The location just off Union Square is very good for touring the city. Instead of the hotel restaurant, which was very expensive, we ate at Lori's Diner across the street. Actually ran into some members of the Boston Red Sox, who were staying at the nearby Westin St. Francis. The staff itself were pleasant enough, but in rather short supply. The valet service, on the other hand, is a DISASTER. Upon checking out, we had to wait at least 25 minutes for our car, and they constantly seemed overwhelmed and disorganized. At nearly $50 a night for parking, that's simply unacceptable.Overall, the next time I'm in San Francisco, I will try a different hotel. The St. Francis is literally down the street, and there are a bunch of others nearby. Its not that the JW is a bad place, its just not a particularly special one. Marriott should invest money and freshen it up if they are going to brand it a JW."
140,2107,"Oct 9 2006 	Great hotel in the middle of everything!	We stayed at the JW Marriot for only one night, but it was the nicest hotel on our road trip. The front desk was very helpful and courteous and the room was very comfortable. The bed was great, as was the bathroom. I rarely take baths in hotel rooms, but I did here, because of the nice fixtures and TV. This hotel is walking distance to many sights and Union Square."
141,2107,"Oct 3 2006 	Excellent stay at the JW Union Square	We stayed at the JW Marriott in downtown San Francisco for 3 nights in Sept. The location of the hotel is perfect, just 4 blocks from the BART station, in the midst of Union Square with lots of chain shops but also some boutiques, great restaurants, theatres and at least one nightclub. A new Bloomingdales opened up a couple blocks away the week after our visit. The lobby and reception areas are very nice. The room was nice size (we had a double double), large bathroom with a tub and separate shower. The furniture and carpet in the room do need an update and this is my sole complaint with the hotel. But the beds were very comfortable, the windows open, and the a/c was incredibly quiet. Front desk, doormen, and housekeeping staff were all very friendly and courteous. Turn down service was a nice touch."
142,2107,"Oct 2 2006 	Great Weekend	Our stay was September 21-24th. We used the BART from the airport and walked about 4 blocks to the property from the Powell Street Station. We discovered this was a great central location and a good value for the price (after comparing to other properties in the area).Quick, friendly check-in (which was true of all of our experiences with the staff - they were friendly, gracious, helpful, respectful, knowledgeable and observant). Room service was quickly delivered our first night. The room was clean and daily maid service was excellent, though I agree with a previous post that the room itself is showing some minor signs of wear and tear (scuff marks, start of peeling wallpaper, etc); also, the mattress &quot;pillow&quot; seemed a bit worn and not nearly as comfortable as other Marriotts where we've stayed, but it was adequate and not important enough to report to the management. Otherwise, the room was spacious enough for two of us to prepare for the day each morning and comfortable enough to stretch out in the evening. Loved the bathroom setup (didn't watch too much TV in there though).We did get a nightcap &amp; dessert one evening for our only other exposure to the hotel's food &amp; drink offerings. Service was up to previously mentioned standards and a delicious bread pudding satisifed my wife's craving for sweets.To accomodate our late afternoon flight home we asked for and received an extra hour to check out (1pm). It was generally a nice experience."
143,2107,"Sep 18 2006 	Marriott's first Five Star hotel in San Francisco	Last April, Marriott took over the previous Pan Pacific Hotel, a luxury hotel on the corner of Marsh and Post streets just one block away from Union Square. The choicest of all locations in our opinion. We had stayed at the Pan Pacific and thought it fine, but already...in just 5 months, Marriott is showing a deft touch at improving the property. Your greeting at the front desk is full of smiles, your room immaculate with valet services and a turn down service. Breakfast was the best hotel breakfast we have ever had and the doorman and garage attendants couldn't have been more accomodating and friendly, An absolute hit with us and already a big improvement. Marriott has two hotel properties down by Fisherman's Wharf. This is their first luxury property in the City of San Fran. And they can be proud of it alreadyArroyo Grande, CA"
144,2107,"Sep 10 2006 	Very Nice Hotel	I stayed at the JW Marriott Sept. 4-8th with my mom. I booked this hotel through Priceline for $90 a night so this was an exceptional deal considering the rooms go for $200 plus a night. They were gracious enough to accomodate my room request of 2 doubles and non-smoking (although the hotel was scheduled to go non-smoking at the end of the week anyways). They also gave me a late check-out (2PM instead of noon).The room itself was very nice. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was very nice, although I would have forgone the large sunken tub for a roomier shower and a second sink. (With 2 women getting ready in the morning, a second vanity is always nice). The shower was pretty small and was hard to maneuver in. Water pressure was just okay. The tv in the bathroom was a nice touch. Our rooms were always cleaned when we returned at night and turndown service was available each night. I did call the front desk the first morning because I was having trouble with the hairdryer. Someone was at my door with a new one in just a few minutes. Although my requests were always pretty simple and mostly direction oriented, the concierge was extremely nice and always happy to help with a smile. This seemed more like a hotel suited for business travelers, but it works just fine for tourists as well. I would recommend this hotel. There are several starbucks within a few block radius - it's just 2 blocks from Union Square and the Powell Cable Car turnaround, and near lots of shopping."
145,2107,"Sep 7 2006 	Great Location at JW	We stayed at the JW in San Fran for 3 nights. We really enjoyed it. it is a chain hotel, but feels very luxurious and personal in a way. Check in was extremely gracious. I booked this through travelzoo, so my rate was very good (160/night) On the trevalezoo web site it said to mention upgrade posiibility at check in. We were upgrade to city view room. It is a nice room that has been updated with new carpeting and new decorating etc. I hate to have seen what a non-view room was as our view was just average....at least we could see some ocean and some hills in the distance. but there were also buildings right next to us. The be is huge and comfy. but it is the bathrooom that is to behold...marble marble and more marble. The seperate shower is a treat, bu the tub would need to be changed...looks out of place in such a beautifull bathroom. There is a small television as well. In the room there is a plasma gateway...which is very nice indeed.My only complaint is bout housekeeping. I think they are understaffed. we had to call for a few things ( stain on Pillow sham) and each time it took FOREVER for service to come. In my opinion, that is not acceptable for a hotel which claims to be 5star...right?the bar area is nice, with 3 oversized fireplaces...but plan on ordering unless you wan to be made to feel out of place if you just want to read by the fire.....strange service approach!all in all we loved Sanfrancisco and the JW was a great, central place from which to visit!"
146,2107,"Aug 25 2006 	Perfect stay!	Fantastic location! I couldn't have been happier with my JW Marriott experience. I stayed 3 nights with my girlfriend to celebrate our anniversary.We arrived early on a Thursday and not only were allowed an early check-in but also were upgraded. After check-in I asked the doorman for a breakfast recommendation and he had the hotel towncar drop us off at Dottie's True Blue Cafe. When we got back to our room, Vivian at the front desk had a bottle of Merlot and a handwritten card to congratulate us.The JW was the best choice for us!"
147,2107,"Aug 14 2006 	Okay but needs a Serious update	I booked this reservation expecting the &quot;JW Marriott&quot; brand to be the flagship of the Marriott chain, and an example of a high end hotel. This was not the case. In general, the hotel looks like it has not been touched since the 1980's. There are cheesy brass and mirrored fixtures everywhere. The marque of a great hotel is how well the small details are addressed. In this case, the carpets were worn and dirty, the baseboards and trim in my room were scuffed and dirty, and the walls had marks all over them. My $12.95 per day internet access was HORRIBLY slow, and the mini bar in my room was never refilled. Its time for a major renovation for this hotel. From a service standpoint, the staff was terriffic! All of the people we encountered did a great job of taking care of us, and really anticipated our needs. There were no service issues at all. All in all, this hotel is worth staying at, as long as you don't pay more than about $170 a night."
148,2107,"Aug 13 2006	Enjoyed our stay	We decided to choose the JW Marriott based on the reviews I read in TripAdvisor. I am glad I relied on those reviews. It was a wonderful experience. The hotel was in a great location, one block from Union Square. The service was wonderful. The concierge was probably the best we ever had at a hotel. Very knowledgeable and always able to provide assistance. The room was perfect. Very comfortable bed. No view but we were out in the city most of the day. We are happy we opted not to have a car in the city and relied on public transportation as the cost for parking was a bit high at $42 per day.I would definitely recommend the hotel. We had gotten a great price through Travelzoo special."
149,2107,"Aug 10 2006 	Great Hotel!!	We stayed at the Marriott for 4 nights while in San Francisco. The check in staff was friendly and we were impressed with our room. We did not have a view, but who spends much time in their room anyway. The beds were extremely comfortable, you almost felt as if you were home and it was great to have extra pillows in the room. The bathroom was amazing, the tub was so incredible that I had to relax in there every day. Having the television in the bathroom was an added bonus while soaking in the tub. I read many reviews and a lot of people were not happy with the flat screen televisions, but I thought that it was great - much better than most hotels. I got an amazing deal on this hotel. I waited until a week before we left and found them on Travelzoo for half the price of all other websites. The location was perfect. Was about a block from Union Square and so many different restaurants to walk to. We had a rental car, but gave it back early since we would not be using it while in the city. You can walk everywhere and take a taxi when needed. Some recommendations for breakfast are Cafe Mason, they have incredible croissant french toast and Sears around the corner for their pancakes. The staff was extremely friendly and were there to help you with anything that you needed.I will definitely recommend the hotel to anyone that is going to San Francisco and can't wait to go back!!My best suggestion for anyone traveling to San Francisco is to pick up some of the guide books that are next to the newspapers on the street corners, not only do they have great maps, but also some discounts for restaurants and attractions."
150,2107,"Aug 7 2006 	This may be one of the better hotels in the area....	...but based on my own travel experience, I cannot give this property more than 3 stars. Granted, this was our first trip to SF, and we had just returned from an AWESOME experience at the Renaissance Lodge in Sonoma. We had high expectations based on all of the postings on TripAdvisor, and I am sorry to say that not a single one of them were met.It is true that we did not encounter any real problems at the JW, however, we were discouraged by the following:- no one from the staff or management acknowledged the special occasion we were celebrating, which I had noted on the reservation. The other hotels we stayed at on the trip offered room upgrades, coupons for special services, or even just a simple &quot;congratulations.&quot;- room was small, strangely shaped, and had lots of wasted space, poor view and ventilation, and a non-functioning air conditioner.- yes, the bathroom was huge with many modern amenities, but what's with the flimy sliding door?- staff entering rooms offered a quick knock before entering instead of giving you an opportunity to actually respond.- there is no pastry cart, coffee shop, or gift shop in the hotel -- simply a high-end restaurant that didn't look like any place we needed to eat.-strange 1-cup coffee maker.-outrageous $47 parking fee.- boring and dated art-deco decor.- younger and inexperienced staff members. There was definitely a feeling of indifference from the employees.Like I said, this was my 1st time in SF and maybe this holds up to the city's standards for 4-star lodging, but it doesn't hold up to mine. We won't be back."
151,2107,"Aug 6 2006 	Very nice hotel	We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. We arrived on a Sunday night after a long flight from London UK. Our taxi driver did not know the hotel, but we had the full address. It seemed that the hotel had recently changed from Pan Pacific into JW Marriott. Maybe a tip for the pr people of Marriott to include taxi drivers in publicity campaigns! The room and the quality of the bed could not have been better. The location is great. One block from Union Square and very close to the theatres. We had a meal in the hotel and although the food was of a high standard we found that the restaurant has little atmosphere. The restaurant is located in the main lobby and is totally open. It did not seem to do much business as it was mostly empty when we ate there or when we past by. The hotel could do with a good coffeeshop."
152,2107,"Aug 1 2006 	Lovely Hotel.	Stayed in the JW Marriott on the last night of our holiday as a treat! We did the rest of the trip (which included Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco the previous weekend, Yosemite and Santa Cruz) on a budget and decided to blow the budget on the last night as we had to catch two flights home the following day which was to take about 20hours in total. This hotel is lovely. It was worth every one of the $249 we paid for it. We arrived at 1pm to check in which was 3 hours earlier than the normal check in time but this wasn't even mentioned to us as we checked in. The room we had booked was not available when checking in so we were given a better room which was fine with us. (I imagined the room would be slightly bigger with maybe a couch or something!) Well when we opened the door to the room we got a shock. We were given a suite which was huge! The bed could have slept 6 people it was so big (it was super comfortable)! Seperate dressing room, huge bath room and tons of space. This was the icing on the cake to a fabulous holiday. The staff in the hotel were lovely. Friendly but not in your face all the time. We used the valet parking at the hotel and found it fantastic. It was a bit of a novelty using the valet parking as its not common where we come from! the hotel was just one black from Union square which was great. We did not eat in the resturant but it looked nice. We had some drinks at the bar when was very plesant. Overall I would have no hesitation in reccommending the JW Marriott in San Francisco and would stay in it again."
153,2107,"Jul 28 2006	Delightful! Great location!	I booked the JW per the tripadvisor reviews. We travelled with our children (7 and 8) and my inlaws. The hotel is spotless - particularly the bathrooms! The decor is lovely and the staff is really wonderful! We ate breakfast at the hotel which was very nice (1/2 price for kids), but didn't eat any other meals there. The location couldn't be beat - better than staying right on Union Square, not as congested - but right around the corner! One caveat, it is an atrium design - the bar and lobby are on the 3rd floor - our rooms were on the 6th floor. Saturday night was very loud due to a roudy bar crew - I called the front desk and the noise quickly died down. If you sleep lightly - higher is better. Rental car tip - the hotel contracts with Hertz - there is a Budget very close to the hotel that was 1/2 the price of Hertz... GREAT HOTEL!!!! Great experience!!!!"
154,2107,"May 29 2006 	My Preferred Hotel in San Francisco	I've stayed at the JW Marriott, starting when it was the Pan Pacific many, many times over the last several years. for business. It's centrally located to downtown SF ( a few blocks off Union Square). It's large enough to have all the amenities you want as a business traveler (decent room service, reliable, in-room high-speed internet (at $9.95/day; though the hotel often waived this for me without my asking) and a very comfortable bed and bathroom. A good desk and chair to work at. A fitness room that is mcuh better than youraverage hotel fitness facility -- more equipment, well-miantained, cheerful (not in some dingy basement.) But a little more intimate than some of the bigger, glitzier hotels.I like the decor, which is modern, Asian-inlfuenced all done in a gentle, warm neutral palette. I understand from the staff, however, that it is being renovated beginning in July 2006 to be like other Marriott's. I hope they don't ruin it's charm. However, it was beginning to be in need of a renovation, so this may not be a bad thing.The staff is friendly and unpretentious; efficient without being over-present. If you want to be fawned over, then you might want to spend more and stay at the Four Seasons or the Ritz-Carleton or the Fairmont. But I have always liked that this was a little more low-key, while still being elegant.If you ike the upper end of the mid-range, and something a little more intimate without shorting you on amenities, this is a great choice.To be seen what Marriott does with. When I last stayed there in May, it was essentially the same."
155,2107,"May 26 2006	Nice Hotel	I am actually staying at the JW Marriott right now. My vacation is scheduled to end Sunday, but I wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind.The hotel is a nice hotel. However, I must agree with a previous poster and say it is a little dark and drab. I think because of the Asian theme. It is not as beautifully decorated as other JWs such as the one in Atlanta or the one in Cancun Mexico. Even though this is the case, it is still decorated nicely.This is what I liked about the hotelStaff: Upon arrival we were upgraded to an executive level corner room. Everyone from the housekeeping staff to the concierge is very helpful. The staff is always offering to help.Rooms: Again, I don't particularly care for the whole cream, brown, black decor, but the rooms are large with very comfortable beds. I will say it appears the furniture could use some changing out as the tables in our room had a multitude of scraches as did the chest outside of the bathroom.Room Service: The food was exactly as ordered and was good. Of course room service is expensive, ( Breakfast for 2 was over $40!) but it was really good.Location: Hotel is close to everything. We went to see a play at the Lorraine Hansbury Theatre and all we had to do was walk 1 block up from the hotel.....SWEET! Union Square is only 2 blocks away and Chinatown is only about 5 blocks away. You are also 1 block from the street car line that will take you down close to the Fisherman's Warf.The Bathroom: Great!!!! Towels are so nice and he products on hand are good too.Cleanliness: The entire hotel was spotless.WHAT I DISLIKED....Small LCD TVs - These TVs are too small to be in these large rooms. Although they are clear, it is still very hard to see. Doesn't matter to me if there is a TV in the bathroom or not, but the main TV should be large enough to see.Decor: Like I said earlier. I did not like the color scheme. Made the hotel too dark. Needs color. I know it's the Asian theme, but if this hotel wants to be known as the JW Marriott and not the Pan Pacific, the decor has to change.The robes: C'mon. I have never seen a JW with the waffle robes. The robes need to be the deep, plush, soft, long terry robes. These little robes barely covered me and I am not a big woman.Overall, the JW Marriott is a nice hotel and I would stay here again. Especially since I got a military rate of $130 per night which was great!."
156,2107,"May 20 2006 	Mediocre	Was eager to try the new San Francisco JW Marriott (formerly Pan Pacific) after great experiences at other JWs worldwide. Overall, my stay was mediocre and below expectations. WHAT I LIKED....* Very comfortable bed -- comparable to the quality and comfort of a Westin or Four Seasons bed. Blows away Marriott's standard fare, and even their new Revive bed * Excellent bathrooms -- with separate showers/baths, good lighting, and lots of amenities* Hotel car -- which was available almost every time I needed a taxi. Saved a boatload of money, though I didn't like being reminded to &quot;take care of the driver&quot; each time I used it* Great location -- with awesome shopping, attractions, and restaurants surrounding the hotel in every direction* Friendly staff -- all of the staff I encountered (housekeeping, front desk, bell desk, and room service) were very friendly WHAT I DISLIKED....* Construction noise - which started every morning between 6-8am. Avoid rooms facing Post or Mason Street if you enjoy sleeping. Stay instead in the back corner of the hotel, though even there you'll hear a bit of noise due to the JW's horrible windows. Annoying!* Small LCD TVs - standard rooms come a 23&quot; Gateway LCD TV, which is ridiculously small given the size of the room and table it sits on. Can't a so-called &quot;luxury&quot; hotel afford 26&quot; or 32&quot; units?* Mediocre service - was checked into a smoking room after requesting nonsmoking. The next day while I was at work, the hotel moved me to a nonsmoking room without warning and neglected to move half of my luggage. Was locked out of my old room and had to visit front desk to figure out what happened. Good intent, but horrible execution* Dull decor -- interior atrium is a bit dark and drab. Marriott really needs to freshen up the designOverall, the JW Marriott has a ways to go before it can compete with the top hotels of San Francisco. I've recently stayed at the Omni, Fairmont, Four Seasons, and Mandarin, and prefer all of them to the JW (though admittedly the latter two are in a different league)."
157,2107,"Apr 17 2006	Loved the Pan Pacific!	From April 8-April 12th, my fiance and I traveled to San Francisco. We stayed in the Pan Pacific hotel located near Union Square. It is absolutely perfect and we will never stay anywhere else when we visit San Francisco again. It is a bit pricey, but it is totally worth it. The concierge and valet are very friendly and will do anything for you. We lost our cell phone the first day there and they called all the airport shuttles and the airport to track the phone. Eventually our phone was returned from a cab driver and delivered to a valet at the hotel, who held on to it until we returned from dinner. Out of 21 floors, we stayed on the 20th floor. The room was large, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was amazing! In the beautiful bathroom were robes, a small television, big mirrors, a telephone, a large tub and a separate shower. We also had our own personal butler simply by pressing a button. Our butler brought us sugar and salt for our food, 10 extra hangers, extra towels, and even gave us bath beads/salts for our bath. The hotel staff members are experts on San Francisco. For every question we had, and we had a lot of them, the staff had a prompt reply. They supplied us with maps, directions, and recommendations. Even after they stopped a taxi for us, they wiped down the seats to make sure they were not wet since it had been raining a lot. Every time that we wanted to go eat the concierge recommended great places. The hotel's restaurant was great for breakfast also--even though it was a bit pricey, it was the BEST we had in San Francisco. One day we rented a car, which our hotel set up for us. The car was from Hertz, which is literally right across the street and was luxurious -a 2006 Toyota Avalon with everything. If I HAD to name two cons: flat screen tv could have had a better picture and we would have liked the hotel to have a pool (even though we had access to one with a fee).It was great, we didn't want to leave the hotel, and we loved our visit!THANKS to everyone at Pan Pacific for making our stay in San Francisco remarkable!"
158,2107,"Apr 7 2006 	Pampered at the Pan Pacific	I thoroughly enjoyed my two-night stay at the Pan Pacific. I got a low on-line rate of $179/night, which was really a bargain for this class of hotel in this city. The lobby was very attractive, with a large, interesting sculpture, a seating area next to a modern fireplace, and a bar that looked like a good place to have a quiet drink. The restaurant looked a bit sterile. I did not eat there, so I can't comment on the food. The rooms in this modern hotel are all arranged around a central empty space so you can look down from a balcony to the lobby and watch the glass, pod-like elevators go up and down. My room looked very much like the room pictured in another traveler's candid photos and the ones on the hotel's website. The bathroom was very luxurious and attractive, with separate tub and marble shower stall. The hairdryer was not the usual one that makes some people want to bring their own anyway. It was the turbo type. There was no jacuzzi or shower massage, as some luxury hotels may have. The complimentary toiletries were very nice and included a shampoo/conditioner, shower gel, and lotion. My room was not on the street, had a view of the rooms of another hotel (not close though), and was very quiet. The room was an off-white color with attractive art. The turn-down service included chocolates, an ice-filled ice bucket, the laying out of the robe(s)on the bed, and the turning on of soft jazz on the radio -- very nice to come home to. A complimentary &quot;USA Today&quot; was delivered in the morning. The mattress was an inner-spring type covered with a filled-type mattress topper. The sheets smelled really fresh, and there were lots of comfy, large pillows. The furniture was nice, but the pieces had sustained some nicking -- perhaps from luggage or vacuuming. The carpet was very handsome. The desk chair was an ergonomic type. The room was separated from the bathroom by the closet and a small hallway. I agree with the other traveler about the in-room coffee. In-room coffee is always bad, but I thought that maybe in such a nice hotel they would have figured out a way to make it drinkable. Also, there should be real cups, not paper. I would recommend this hotel for a romantic get-away -- especially if you can get a good, on-line deal. The location is fantastic."
159,2107,"Feb 11 2006 	A Welcome Suprise!	A usual guest of the Ritz Carlton and the Fairmont, I chose the Pan Pacific this time as I was spending the weekend and wanted to be near Union Square. The rate was excellent so I decided to try it..What a wonderful surprise! The location is superb, the room I had was huge and very well laid out. The service was excellent and unobtrusive. I was there mostly for business and unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problem with internet access and again ,the layout of the room was such that I felt very comfortable working. The ability to walk everywhere is a huge draw and the staff was always friendly and helpful. Some soft good room renovations may be in order but mostly, no problem. I agree mini-bar selections should be upgraded as well as brighter bathroom lighting -room service offerings could also be greater for those of us &quot;chained to the computer.&quot; I will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific again, and look forward to it!"
160,2107,"Feb 6 2006	Excellent -- quiet clean and friendly	Stayed at this hotel for just one night. Checkin was very quick and they gave us an upgraded room, which we were told meant &quot;a bigger bathroom&quot;. The hotel is not the newest but it is classy and once inside the room it feels very private because it is nice and quiet. The bed was extremely comfortable.Upon exiting the hotel to go out for dinner we told the bellboy we needed a taxi and he offered us the hotel towncar -- free of service, &quot;just tip the driver&quot;. A nice touch.All in all a positive 4* experience in a good location in San Francisco and would definitely stay again."
161,2107,"Feb 2 2006 	Great location	We spent a long weekend at the Pan Pacific for business. This is the 2nd time we stayed at this location (the first time primarily because of a deal I found on travelzoo). Out of all the hotels we've visited in SF, this is one of our favorites, because:1) location -- it's less than one block from Union Square, close enough to pop into Saks but far enough that you don't walk out right into all the tourist crowds. 2) service -- is amazing. From the men who valet park ($40/d for in and out privilege, which is competetive if not reasonable for the area), to the concierge, to the room service, everyone is there to please. I was always greeted by name when I called anywhere in the botel. The server in the restaurant remembered what we liked for breakfast. We had a problem with our room safe and the service tech was there in 5 minutes. 3) clean -- room and bathroom. Little touches like crown molding on the ceiling add a nice touch.4) price -- much more affordable than Four Seasons or even the Westin, and I don't feel like I'm missing anything. Even the minibar is affordable.The cons:1) There is no storage space in the rooms. One little bureau is all. 2) For business travelers, there's nowhere in the hotel to really eat well, but some of the best restaurants in SF are a block away. Also, the charge for internet and printer use is high."
162,2107,"Jan 26 2006	2nd Time Was A Charm	We stayed here last July (see my review) and had a horrible experience. After we got home, I went to the hotel's website and much to my surprise, it listed the managers for each department and included their contact information. I contacted the Director of Room Operations and explained our experience (via email). Our hats off to Jim Bolinger (the Director of Room Operations) for his quick follow-up and sincere concern about our experience. He replied to our email within a day, apologizing profusely for our experience and offered us a gift certificate for a free night's stay. This is the type of service that is lacking with so many other establishments. For most hotels, you are lucky if you get a general information phone number that sends you to a corporate call center, but with this hotel, contact information for each manager is listed right on the hotel's website.During our return visit, check-in was flawless and the reception person was quite friendly. Our room was spotless and extremely comfortable (though I'm still not sure what people need with such a large room when they are on vacation in a big city, but in any event). The horror of our previous stay was erased and we had a restful night's sleep.The Concierge offered us a spot on suggestion for a place to hear live Blues music. He sent us to Biscuits and Blues, about a block and a half away. The music was great and the food was delicious! The Concierge's recommendation for breakfast the following morning was just as good.I'm glad we went back to give Pan Pacific another try. We were delighted by our experience and plan to make this our hotel of choice for those quick &quot;big city&quot; getaways."
163,2107,"Jan 24 2006	Check it out!	My husband and I are from Boston and travel quite extensively. We went to San Francisco on Christmas to spend some time with our daughter. We ended up staying a month. I've always wanted to stay at the Pan Pacific, but didn't really want to spend that much money, especially for an extended stay. I just called up the reservations manager and asked for some cosideration based on the length of our stay and payment up front. She was very accomodating. We Loved it there! We have stayed in many hotels in San Francisco (from budget to boutique to fancy) and this was worth every cent and more. They went out of thier way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The Bellmen were super courteous and helpful, the concierge couldn't do enough,Michelle the Bar girl was great and most of all, Christine, THANK YOU. We now have a home away from home. The rooms are a good size, beds-super plush and comfy, bathrooms are large, marbled, and some have TV'S. Even at regular price, you get what you pay for and we got a lot more than expected. I would suggest the Pan Pacific anytime!"
164,2107,"Jan 19 2006 	Nice but not for business travelers	I stayed in this hotel for 10 days on business, and overall it was very nice. I had an AMAZING view of the city that was especially gorgeous at night. However, the construction on the roof of the building next door did tend to detract from it - not to mention that it woke me up bright and early despite my late work hours.The problem was that we were under the impression that it was a business-oriented hotel. Not so. My assistant had computer problems, and it was a whopping 49 cents a minute just to use the business center. Even with a decent budget, that was way beyond any reasonable range and it left us stuck until we could get him a new computer.Internet access is expensive, and wireless is not available in the rooms. You're chained to the desk. Also, even if you've paid your $10/day for in-room access, you still have to pay an additional $10 per day if you want to use the wireless in the lobby. Parking is a budget-breaker at $42 plus tax per day, but we expected that. What we didn't expect was how long it would take to get our car. Even when we called down, it was often 20-30 minutes. Once, they lost our car which made us late for an important meeting. Finally, the in-room coffee is terrible and you only get two packets. Luckily, there's a great little coffeehouse a few doors down. Don't count on having a late-night caffeine kick available as you're working on that presentation. The honor bar choices are awful too, nothing healthy in there and nowhere to get quick munchies.This would be a nice place to stay for fun, but if you expect any basic business amenities, don't let the comfy office chairs they advertise fool you. You'll work more efficiently at any basic Courtyard."
165,2107,Jan 10 2006	Very Very Good Value!	We are just back from the Pan Pacific in San Francisco and it is pretty hard not to like. Here is a quick review: Location: Excellent - not on Union Square - but only one block away and handy to everything downtown. Room: Furnishings are of an excellent quality - Excellent bedding (new and well laundered) - Upgraded Mattress - extra long tub - bathroom exceeded expectations - Room came with two robes rather than the more standard 1.Butler service - didnt use it.Car service - was excellent - used it 4 times for dinner transportation - everyone was polite and I didnt receive any resistance when asking to use it.Concierge: was excellent. Very good dinner recommendations within my price range / service expectations and cuisine preferences. They were also able to get me very short notice reservations at Garry Danko (a AAA 5 diamond restaurant).Front Desk - polite and efficientMaid service - unobtrusive and efficientValue - $200+ a night service levels at a $150 a night rate.Noise - San Francisco can be fairly loud - a la Manhattan. I had a 15th floor room and it was very very quite.Final thought - Pan Pacific is not the most attractive of hotels from an architectural standpoint. However the rooms are impeccably clean; excellently furnished and the staff are very competent. It is a quite and very reasonably priced.Food recommendations:Garry Danko - 5 star cuisine in the $200+ range for 2Rue Lepic - near Pan Pacific - French home style cooking - standard Bistro fare - $70 for 2Afternoon Tea - Neiman Marcus Rotunda Room - $50 for 2.Breakfast - Sears Fine Foods Union Square - excellent portions - really well prepared - good menu - two blocks from Pan Pacific.
166,2107,"Jan 4 2006	Fantastic Hotel	We recently chose the Pan Pacific as our destination for two nights of celebrating our anniversary. After extensive research of the area and the many hotel choices, we chose the Pan Pacific after receiving a great deal on the internet. We were pleasantly surprised and extremely happy with our choice. We were upgraded to a higher floor after explaining that it was our anniversary. We were welcomed to a large room with extensive views of the city, along with a complimentary plate of fruit, cheeses, and crackers. The room was spotless and the bathroom was beautifully decorated with marble, mirrors, and even a television to watch while soaking in the tub! Each time we returned to the hotel from a walk, we were greeted with &quot;Welcome back&quot; and each morning we were greeted with &quot;Good morning&quot; and smiling faces. The staff (especially at the guest registration desk and the doormen) were so great to us, the doorman even remembered our name. They also provide complimentary car service (during certain hours), and the driver was great recommending restaurants for us. For those that like to work off the excess calories they have ingested while on vacation, the hotel has a very nice gym with 3 televisions, water, and complimentary fruit to snack on. Overall, this was a great stay at the Pan Pacific and we will definitely make it our hotel of choice from now on when visiting the city."
167,2107,"Dec 29 2005	mixed feeling	My husband and I just got back from San Francisco. We stayed here for 2 nights. I had a high expectation of the hotel since my family and I had stayed many many times at Pan Pacific around the world and had always experienced a first class service. Goods:- We were assigned a room for disable, therefore, there was only a shower and no tub as promised. We asked to be reassigned and the nice man who checked us in previously was able to reassign us another room with a tub. He was very friendly and accomodating. - The room was nice.. very spacious. Liked the design. - The bed was comfortable. Lots of extra fluffy pillows. - A perfect location. One block from Union Square. Close enough to walk to the shopping area, but not smacked in the middle of the crowd. - Loved the big bathroom. A small TV in the bathroom was a nice touch. Loved taking a bath and watching my favorite sitcom at the same time. The bads:- The &quot;doormen&quot; were unfriendly. Not even once they ever said hello or smiled at us when we walked by. In fact, one time my husband said hello and was ignored even though he clearly was looking at us. - Another bad experience with the unfriendly &quot;doormen.&quot; We were told the hotel provided a car service. We asked a doorman if the car would take us to Japantown. He started laughing and condesendingly said, &quot;That's 15 blocks from here.&quot; A simple &quot;no&quot; would do. - During check in, the nice man I mentioned above mentioned I should take advantage of the butler drawing bath for guests. It sounded nice, so I thought, why not. So, when we got to the room, we requested the buttler to draw me a bath. First of all, the butler lady was so puzzled when we requested it (I checked, it was listed as one of the services they provided guests). When she came to our room, she asked me if I would do it myself. She gave me a bowl of bath salt and left. I didn't mind doing that myself, but you cannot advertise your service and not deliver. At the end, I could only rate this hotel 3 out of 5. Maybe what their employees need is a class on &quot;Customer Service.&quot;"
168,2107,"Dec 28 2005	One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had!	We had the pleasure of staying at the Pan Pacific in San Francisco for three nights, including Christmas Eve and Christmas day. Prior to arrival, I had already called two times to confirm what type of room we'd be having and that we would be arriving late at night. Upon check-in, we were upgraded to a Jr. Suite (King bed, pull out sofa, huge bathroom), as all the double rooms were full. The person at the front desk was extremely helpful and pleasant and gave us a call about 30 minutes late to make sure that everything in our room was okay. The room was quite large, was a corner and had large windows on both sides. We were on the 11th floor, so the views weren't spectacular, but you could see a bit of Union Square and the hustle and bustle of the San Francisco Streets.During our stay we sought the services of the concierge a couple of different times, and were always met with prompt and friendly service, including helping us to find places that were open around the city on Christmas day. He also helped us to check-in for our flight and print boarding passes. All employees of the hotel that we encountered were extremely helpful, friendly and polite. Room service food was quite good, prompt and abundant for a reasonable rate (for room service). The bed was extremely comfortable. We were able to check out as late at 2 p.m. on our departure day.Overall, a great hotel experience!"
169,2107,"Dec 22 2005 	Big rooms ambivalent service poor plasma TVs	Two-night stay in early December 2005. Service levels, unfortunately, depend greatly on the individual employee you encounter. I was checked into a standard room with a non-working TV and two double beds (I'm 6-4.) When I returned to the desk at 11:35 PM, with all my luggage in tow, I said, &quot;We'll have to try again - the tv won't turn on with either the remote or the button on the TV.&quot; Without looking up or giving me any eye contact, the clerk said &quot;We'll have engineering go up in a bit.&quot; This is at 11:35 PM. Not the answer I expected or was looking for; certainly no apology or empathy. So, I escalated with &quot;Well, given that I'm 6-4, I'd prefer a king bed anyway, so let's go ahead and try another room.&quot; The clerk's response: &quot;We don't have any king rooms left.&quot; Said in a flat tone of voice, still without eye contact. Lucky for me, the clerk who had originally checked me in (with good hospitality) came out at that moment and recovered nicely for the other clerk, immediately placing me in what PP calls a &quot;junior suite&quot; but what is actually a larger corner room with a king bed.If this Pan Pacific property reminds you of a Hyatt, with its vertical interior atrium room arrangement, it's because it's a Portman pre-Hyatt design. Lots of thick walls, thick marble, thick circles. The rooms themselves are large and reasonable, but dated. Bathrooms are generous but very &quot;Family Affair/Buffy/Jody&quot; in their decor - too much almond/beige, including all fixtures. The TVs in the rooms are far too small and, with only standard-definition signals coming in, the result is a too-soft, smeared picture.This is not a hotel to stay in for any views of the city.Additional snarky service was experienced at the hotel bar and by the concierge. My colleague asked the concierge if he had any tape to secure a box. Without looking up, the employee rummaged in a drawer, produced a roll of plastic tape, placed it on the counter, and went back to their paperwork. For this class of hotel, one expects at least &quot;Certainly sir, here you go;&quot; &quot;Would you like me to secure that? Do you need it sent anywhere?&quot; was evidently beyond the comprehension of the employee."
170,2107,"Dec 18 2005	Great find	We stayed at the Pan Pacific for 5 nights from Thanksgiving after researching on tripadvisor. We got a great deal for a superior room on Expedia.It's a great hotel and the room was lovely and big. The location was fabulous, a 2 minute walk to Union square and all the hustle and bustle of downtown. The concierge was fantastic and secured us a table at a wonderful restaurant for a celebration.I think that this hotel should be higher in the ratings, it is excellent value for money."
171,2107,"Dec 5 2005	Excellent	Another great choice based on TA reviews.The location--Union Square--is ideal. Walk to Chinatown, BART, cable car (if you must), shopping, SOMA, restaurants. The area just to the west is a bit seedy at nite, but in perspective downtown SF is the safest-seeming big city I've been to in the US. Hotel also has a complimentary town car--they took me to the CalTran station--have no idea how much further you can push it.From the outside nothing special but the upper lobby (base of the atrium) has some sort of impressive modernist sculpture and a nice (but pricey) bar. Plenty of Irish pubs in the area too. Notice one reviewer panned the restaurant. Served him right. Within a few blocks is a great Indonesian place, a Morton's, a wonderful taqueria, and the best Chinese outside China. Anyone who travels a bit can attest: ONLY LOSERS EAT IN THEIR HOTEL! The room was clean, bright, large enough, with a large immaculate marble bathroom with separate shower and bath. Service was efficient, though they were mysteriously stingy replenishing the soap. PP is really a first-rate business hotel that works great for vacations, though nothing particularly charming, romantic or historic about it. If you're in SF on business you can probably find something closer to the financial district/Embarcadero but at the cost of things to do at nite. Highly recommended."
172,2107,"Dec 2 2005	Absolutely loved this hotel	Stayed in Pan Pacific for 4 nights, had an amazing time. Arrived to the hotel around 2am after a long flight from New York with a small child, manager at the desk was very friendly, we got upgraded to a suite even though we only paid for a double room. Once we got to the room we noticed that there was one king size bed, we called the desk right away and they brought a roll-away bed for our son, only took them 5 minutes. We had a great stay, staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean, beds are very comfortable. We did think about having lunch at the hotel restaurant but the menu wasn't very good and a bit pricey. There are plenty of good restaurants around, check out The Cheesecake Factory nearby (in Macy's). I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again next time i'm in San Francisco."
173,2107,"Dec 2 2005	Peachy Pan Pacific	We had a wonderful two night stay at the Pan Pacific. My wife uses her wheelchair in our room, and the room we booked was not a traditional accessible-type, so when I called to make the reservation, the concierge had maintainence go up and measure the bathroom door opening to make sure it would work for her.This is the kind of service that made our stay so enjoyable. Our room on the 18th floor was spacious, clean, and night-time quiet despite only being a block from Union Square.Kudos to the Pan Pacific. We will be back. Jim Myers"
174,2107,Nov 30 2005	dined at restaurant	we had dinner at their restaurant and the food wassimply awful! (regular food-japanese style)Informed the head waiter that we were very disappointed with the food. all they could say wasthat they were sorry.when I got back home I sent a letter to The Pan Pacific Hotel in San Francisco. a letter to the Customer Relations one to the Hotel Management  and one to the Restaurant Manager  So far I have't heard from them.
175,2107,"Nov 28 2005	A great hotel in a great location	We stayed at the Pan Pacific for four nights the weekend prior to Thanksgiving. We stayed in a Superior room. The Superior room is very comfortable and spacious enough to keep you from feeling claustrophobic. There is a loveseat and side chair in addition to the desk area which is great, especially for just relaxing at the end of the day prior to going to bed.The bathrooms were very clean and modern. We booked the room through Expedia and had no problems at all during our entire stay. We booked a Deluxe room from one night for a visiting friend who lived outside the city, and though the room is noticeably smaller than the Superior room we had, (there is no couch and side chair in a Deluxe room), it was very nice, and again had a very clean and spacious bathroom.I would recommend the Pan Pacific to anyone traveling to the San Francisco area."
176,2107,"Nov 28 2005	Great stay a the Pan Pacific	My partner and I just returned from a 4-night stay just prior to Thanksgiving and overall, we really enjoyed our stay. Although we had standing reservations at the Prescott across the street (I stayed there years ago and loved it) we decided to give the Pan Pacific a try after seeing a special web promotion offering a superior king room for just $129/nt + tx. We were not disappointed!First, the Pan's location is excellent. It's a stone's throw from Union Square, but situated just far enough from all of the square's traffic noise and crowded sidewalks. It's also a short walk to Market St., Chinatown and North Beach making it a great base of operations for a SF vacation (and for people who love to see a town on foot!)Our 8th floor room had a decent view of the Mason &amp; Post intersection and it was comfortable and well appointed. Features included an exceptionally large bathroom, separate dressing area, and a tastefully decorated bedroom. We enjoyed the three phones and the Herman Miller desk chair, but best of all was the room's ultra-comfy pillow-top bed. I'd put it right up there with the &quot;heavenly beds&quot; featured at some of the Pan's competitors (e.g. Starwood properties like W or Westin). I slept really, really well on this trip (not often the case for me) and I have to give lots of credit to the bed! From the front desk, to the bell hops, to the personal butler service available on all floors, the service was consistently professional, warm and friendly. Speaking of the butler service, the butlers we encountered were prompt, friendly and gracious. While this service is a unique and welcome feature at this hotel, we were a little surprised to learn that it's also the ONLY way to obtain ice for your room. It would be nice to also offer guests the do-it-yourself option for ice, rather than summoning the help each time. Between ringing for the butler, waiting for a phone call back for clarification, followed by waiting for the doorbell or knock, and then the awkwardness of whether to tip each time...well... it just seemed like a few too many hoops to jump through (and a few too many minutes to wait) just for a simple bucket of ice. I have to clarify that this is not so much a complaint, as it is an observation/ suggestion. Please - don't let our little ice delivery issue keep you from checking out this fine hotel...In summary, the Pan Pacific's prime location, friendly staff, tasteful room design (well-represented on their web site) and some VERY comfy beds all added up to a great stay. We'd gladly return!"
177,2107,"Nov 21 2005	Pan Pacific San Francisco stay in early-November 2005	My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our recent visit to San Francisco. We had no idea what to expect but were tremendously pleased with our decision after. Here's our main reasons why:Location: excellent. Literally a couple of minutes walk from Union Square and all the wonderful shopping possibilities there (e.g. Macys, Neiman Marcus, Saks, etc). Also close to the public transport stops, for both trams and sub-way stops. We walked everywhere: Fisherman's Wharf, Market Street, Embarcadero, North Beach..etc. Food: Zagat-rated restaurant in-house. Expensive but delicious. We paid around USD 35, for a Caesar Salad and 2 hot chocolates.Service: Very friendly and non-intrusive. Room comfort: our superior-room was spacious and clean with a very comfortable king-sized bed. We got a deal through their Internet site for USD 153 per night incl. of taxes.Fitness room: range of fitness equipment available (cross-trainer, treadmill, bikes, weights, machines) 24-hours."
178,2107,"Nov 6 2005	Large Room	We booked this room through Expedia $194 per night. We stayed 2 nights. The parking was too expensive so we caught a ride into the city and caught the Bart out of the city. The Bart was very convenient so long as your luggage isn't too large and heavy. The room was very large it had 2 closets, robes, desk with an ergonomic chair which was great, LCD television screen, Bose radio, couch, coffee maker, king sized bed, our bathroom did not have a lot of counter space with a pedestal sink, Gilchrist and Soames toiletries, hair dryer, no tub, just a shower stall with some mold visible if you look good. We were in a corner room so it was very quiet. There was a butler button if you needed one, the staff seemed nice and helpful. There was also a safe which they state can fit your computer. we thought the location was great! The hotel was close to union square, market street, and shopping. I probably would stay here again but would want to pay less."
179,2107,Oct 24 2005	Disappointing	Really has gone downhill since our last visit a few years ago. Seems like the magic disappeared. Room was OK eventhough we tried pretty hard to get a good view- but that didn't happen. Hall carpets were wet as they were being washed on our floor- so much for the ambience. Parking is such a rip off. Concierge does not match the level of the others at similiar hotels. Will probably spend a little more and stay elsewhere next time around.
180,2107,"Oct 21 2005 	very good	no major complaints. the room was very large and clean, and well appointed. minor beef with the color scheme in the bathroom- some kind of ugly peachy/cream color. should have gone with basic white. nice stall shower as well as bathtub. very good water pressure, plush plenitful towels, and the nicest robe anywhere.decent city view. nice LCD tv, albeit a little small. (must have acquired them before the bottom fell out on flat panel prices).very nice workout area with all new equipment.the staff was decent enough, with and occasionally indifferent doorman. the butler concept i didnt quite get, nor did i see him, but whatever, im sure he worked for me.even though it was only a few blocks from union square, for some reason it still felt a bit removed from it all. perhaps because that particular neighborhood was a bit shabby.overall an excellent hotel, professionally run. a decent choice."
181,2107,"Oct 14 2005	Great location in San Francisco	We were very impressed with the Pan Pacific. Great location, close to transport, shopping and good restaurants. A huge hotel but didn't feel impersonal, service was swift and friendly at all times. We got a good deal through Expedia and felt is was great value for money - would definitely go back there when visiting San Francisco again.PS: though I've heard much mention of the 'construction' we did not see or hear it."
182,2107,"Oct 5 2005	Very nice	Very nice experience at this hotel. Booked on line thru a discounter so was not dissapointed with lack of a view.. with the price we paid it was worth it!Only one gripe was having to pay close to $8 to print out my plane boarding passes thru their business center. Felt it should be a free feature at a hotel of this class. But I highly recommend the hotel for its location, amenities and luxury (Bathroom was incredible)!!"
183,2107,"Sep 23 2005	You get your own butler regardless of room choice!!!	We were warmly welcomed, check in really fast and given a guided tour of our room. A huge room I must add and it was the cheapest one on the net $170. Big cosy bed, flatscreen TV, Bose radio, TV in the bathroom whilst you soak in the bath, HUGE vanity area, seperate shower with great water pressure, bathroom scales so you can see how many pounds you have gained on your trip!! and last but not least EVERY room has a button where you can call your personal butler for your every whim. I have to say I did not use it once as everything is already provided for you.Right on union square, a 5 min walk from BART/MUNI, right on a trolley car line, a courtesy house car to take you to wherever you wish in downtown....... An excellent hotel.Also 3 minutes walk at 643 Post St there is a GREAT Thai Restaurant called Ar Roi. Give Mortons Steakhouse in the other direction a miss though."
184,2107,"Sep 21 2005	Impressed	Is there really such a thing as a &quot;perfect&quot; stay? Perhaps this deserves a 5-circle rating. It probably would have gotten it if not for a couple of drawbacks. I stayed at the Pan Pacific on 9-16-05. One drawback was the fact that it was a little pricey @ $250 for a one-night stay in a Deluxe King through hotels--which was the cheapest rate available. I've seen other reviews that talked about the radio alarm going off unexpectedly. Yes, that happened to us also at 6:15 a.m. When I first arrived at check-in, there was only one person at the desk initially. The man--an early 30ish male, stocky build, with a receding hairline, dirty blondish hair and LONG bangs combed backwards--was helping another couple which was fine. But he clearly saw me, as well as another couple behind me, yet continued to carry on a very LONG and UNNECESSARY casual conversation with the couple. Needless to say I thought this was extremely inconsiderate. He could've at least taken a second just to ACKNOWLEDGE we were there. Eventually another woman came to the desk who was very accomodating. It took her forever to authorize my credit card but that was due to the glitches in her computer equipment. She was very fast, friendly, and thorough. Onto the room...Very spacious for a couple...Everything was spotless...The marble bathroom was immaculate...The shower was a little on the small side, especially if you plan on &quot;sharing&quot; it with another person (LoL), but was still nice. The flatscreen TV was great with a large array of channels should you actually take time to watch it. Room service was swift and the food was good. Valet service brought us a bucket of ice to our room quickly. There was no view, but I never requested one. All in all, it was an impressive hotel and I would definitely stay there again. Just remember to request a room with a view if it's important to you, and UNPLUG THE CLOCK RADIO AS SOON AS YOU STEP IN THE ROOM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AWAKENED!!! ;]"
185,2107,"Sep 20 2005	Excellent choice for the picky traveler	My partner and I stayed in this hotel and was impressed from the beginning. The staff are helpful and polite while the accommodations are attractive and tasteful. Our room did not feel too small and the all marble bathroom is impressive. A free in-room safe, coffee maker, mini-bar, advanced television system and a BOSE radio made the room a very nice place to stay. Add to that the location is ideal for nightlife, theatre, shopping or exploring Chinatown. We lucked out and the big gay dance club was only a few blocks away! We felt very safe walking at night around the hotel and taxis are plentiful. There was construction on our side of the hotel but they were nowhere in sight during the weekend and not all that loud on the weekday. The tubed elevators are very Shagadelic!All in all - a place I would return to again and recommend to friends."
186,2107,"Sep 16 2005 	Consistently great	Stay here around once a year and hotel always remembers preferences (NY Times, high floor etc) without being reminded. Great new beds, superb service, great value for San Francisco."
187,2107,"Sep 14 2005	Pan Pacific Hits the Spot	We spent three days at the Pan Pacific over the Labour Day weekend. The person on the front desk was friendly and professional and swiftly checked us in. Our room was beautiful (superior king). It was a large room with a fresh contemporary design. The bathroom was luxurious - a sunken bath, a shower with good pressure (a must!), large sink with a large well lit mirror; and the toilet was discretely tucked behind a dividing wall.Other reviewers have expressed concern about the noise so I felt I should comment on this. Our room looked onto a side street and although there was some noise, I only noticed this on the first night - for me it was just a case of adjusting to the city. Daytime concierge was very friendly and helpful - although we were given misinformation in terms of the nearest MUNI stop.A word on room service - in the morning the service was excellent - be aware that there is a wider room service menu than the room card would suggest - I made the mistake of thinking the breakfast choices were very limited and later discovered that there were more choices in the hotel welcome book! Regardless, the service was efficient and friendly. However, the same cannot be said for evening room service. We called down for room service at about 10:30pm and received no response; concierge picked up the phone and he said he would call us back, but no return call was made! This was a real disappointment as this did not reflect the usual efficient service. Breakfast was a bit pricey (normal 4* prices really) but delicious. I had brioche french toast with maple syrup and pear and my partner had a cooked breakfast. I don't go for cooked breakfasts because I find them too greasy/heavy, but his looked really good. Also their double lattes are the best! I chose the Pan Pacific based on reviews I had read on TripAdviser, it lived up to my expectations and more and I would definitely stay there again if I were to visit SF in the future."
188,2107,"Sep 14 2005	Great hotel great location great staff....	We really enjoyed our stay at the Pan Pacific. We moved here from another SF hotel (The Marriott Fisherman's Wharf), which really wasn't for us. The Pan Pacific hit the mark. We booked a rate of $170/night from the hotel wesbite, which we felt was excellent value. Our experience of the staff was superb. The front desk were really nice and happily accomodated our request for a room on a high floot - we ended up right at the top with a superb view of the city! We found the concierge helpful and effcient, and the doorman was also a real credit to them. The room was comfortable, with a fantastic bathroom, and we really liked the curved window. A couple of issues were that we also experienced an alarm going off at what seemed like the middle of the night!! Also we heard all sorts of banging around in the conference rooms above us quite late at night, which we thought ma have been them fixing something as it only lasted about 10 minutes. All in all though, we had a great stay at the Pan Pacific and would definately stay there again."
189,2107,"Sep 12 2005	Very Satisfied	Arriving after a very long day of flight and drive, we were pleased to find very attentive and pleasant staff to handle the vehicle and assist with luggage.Check in was without hastle and our front desk staff moved efficiently to complete checkin and send us on to our room.As you might read elsewhere, the rooms were very nicely appointed, the dual TV's a good touch (sleeping and bath area), robes and a safe are always appreciated as well.The bed itself was quite comfortable and the room, as well as the hotel facility,clean and very presentable. I would add a special kudo to the hosekeeping staff for doing a very fine job.Despite the early start for any city in the morning, we did not notice any unexpected or overly loud noise problems, especially being in the heart of the city.We would definitely return. The Pan is centrally located, close to shopping and eateries of all kinds and one feels secure within the property. Give it a try!"
190,2107,"Sep 9 2005	Good Location Decent hotel	We stayed at the Pan Pacific hotel in SF for three nights over the Labor Day weekend. First, the good: It is a clean hotel in a good location close to Union Square. The room was clean and the bathroom was particularly nice. I liked the gym- while not large, it had everything you need and the equipment looked new. Now, the not so good. We arrived and the gentleman at the front desk was not a gentleman. He seemed clueless when we informed him that we were expecting a bag from the airline who had lost our luggage. Then, he disputed our room rate. Basically, it was $170 for the first two nights and $150 for the third - booked through the hotel's web site. I asked for the manager who appeared - and was a bit nicer - but required that I pull up the reservation from my email and print out the confirmation. This, to me, is a bit much, particularly since I provided to them my confirmation number for the reservation. All in all, I find this extremely time consuming after a long trip. The manager did provide fruit and an apologetic note in our room for the next two nights. Further, the room was a bit loud from outside noise throughout the night. It did not bother me because I live in the city, but I could see it bothering others. My husband also complained that he could hear noice from other rooms. What's more, my husband said that the alarm clock in our room went off the first morning at 4:30 am (which we did not set.). Fortunately, I did not wake up!! Lastly, I saw virtually no hotel personnel throughout our stay, which seemed odd for a four star hotel. Perhaps, it may be because the lobby was on the third floor."
191,2107,"Sep 3 2005	A great value in a prime location	We were staying at the Pan Pacific for our anniversary and booked our trip through priceline. According to the Pan Pacific's rates, the cheapest room in the place is $340 per night, but we found a great all-inclusive deal that averaged out to about $100 per night. The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially at the concierge desk. After a long travel day, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, and it took a little prompting on my part to speed up the process - which I shouldn't have to do. Everything else was extremely positive after that, though. The concierge was very helpful in booking us a rental car. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. It's not a huge room, but we weren't in our room very often anyways. Another note about the room - the street noise is pretty loud at times; I woke to the sounds of bottles being dumped into a bin from the lounge across the street and the ambulance/police sirens a few times as the windows are single-paned and don't keep out sound very well. The workout room on the 5th floor was nice, and it seemed to be getting regular use from the hotel guests. It was maintained very well. We didn't eat at the restaurant, and it didn't look as though it received a lot of business. The menu looked great, but was pricey. Housecleaning was fantastic! They really did a nice job each day on our room. The Pan Pacific is convenient for getting on the bus line and trolley lines. Most lines were 1-3 blocks away. Finally, I liked the 3rd floor lobby. It was a good choice for placing the lobby, as we didn't have to walk through crowds to get to our room. We could just bypass all of that with the elevator. By the way - the glass elevators are a nice touch! We will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific again. We encountered many other tourists at different SF sights asking us where we were staying, and they said that we were lucky to be there because of the reputation of the place. Plus, many others weren't enamored with their accomodations. That felt good to know that on our first trip, we hit it on the mark with our hotel choice!"
192,2107,"Aug 29 2005	Pan Pacific was great!	As a family of 4, we all loved the Pan Pacific. The kids really thought it was great to have a TV in the bathroom. The beds were very comfortable and the room was nicely decorated. The hotel was very clean. Some others have complained about construction noise but we didn't hear any noise during our 2 night stay and never saw any construction around the hotel. Staff was very nice. We were allowed early check-in without any hassle. We would definitely stay again and recommend it to others."
193,2107,"Aug 25 2005	This is how you define service	We arrived from Hawaii before 6 am having booked 2 rooms near each other for our family (husband, me and 2 teenage boys). I had advised them when I booked that we were coming in early and they said they would see what they could. As it was so early I didn't expect anyone would have checked out and was dreading facing several sleep-deprived hours somewhere before we could get a room.The manager immediately started looking for available rooms as ours were not ready. He located two, but on different floors; we wanted them on the same floor at minimum. He found one available for us and another that would open up later in the day. Within 15 minutes of our arrival, we were in the room (our bags having been delivered without having to do anything), resting and so relieved to have a place to stay before exploring SF.What really impressed me was that I never heard &quot;well, it IS hours before normal checkout&quot; or &quot;Not sure we can find something&quot;. In fact, they didn't even treat it as a problem as has been my experience at other hotels. They were just delighted to help us and did so in a very pleasant and efficient manner.Beyond that it is a lovely hotel in great location for a reasonable rate for SF. The concierge found us a reservation at a nearby restaurant that evening on very short notice. I had not even heard of Pan Pacific hotels before I started looking for SF hotels and felt I was taking a bit of a chance. Now I would stay at a Pan Pacific with no hesitation if they are all like the one in San Francisco."
194,2107,"Aug 22 2005	very satisfied with the pan pacific	just had a really pleasant three-night stay at the &quot;pan pac&quot; utilizing the amex special. (50% off rack rate and third night free) thanks to the reviewers below who posted about it!pros-concierge printed a boarding pass for me, and reserved separate shuttles for my mom and me-free newspaper delivered to our door-pretty cool technology: flat screen tv, bose wave radio, tv in bathroom. looks like they're working to make all the rooms wi-fi. i didn't bring a laptop, so wasn't able to test it out-central location-it was a bit chilly outside, but the room always seemed to be the perfect temperaturecons-a bit noisy (slight construction noise, and a few sirens)-view from east side of building faces a dental building-only one robe in the room for two guests, but not really a problem. i called to request another robe, and it was delivered to our room in five minutes"
195,2107,"Aug 18 2005	Just wonderful	A great place to stay, well located and the staff was very helpful! We never got lost because of them. The rooms are wonderful, clean and have everything you need and if you are missing something just call the butler... windows are a little thin...so outside noise might be a factor"
196,2107,"Aug 16 2005	Very Good! Great Service and Location.	Very well run 4 star hotel. Good service, unbeatable Union Sq location. The rooms are nicely furnished with marble bathrooms, very comfortable bedding and butler service on request for all rooms. We had a good breakfast at the Pacific restaurant. It is not your only choice however as there are many restaurants within a block or 2. The door man found us a nice town car limo to the airport for only $44, same price as a cab. Highly recommended hotel."
197,2107,"Aug 15 2005	Enjoyed the room and especailly the location	We booked through Expedia at $180. I think it was a good value for the city location, one block from Union Square and cablecar stop, two blocks from Chinatown. Sears is the traditional, nostalgic place for breakfast (Swedish pancakes, 1.5 blocks away, line moves quickly). Bathroom was best feature of room with marble, TV, separate tub and shower. Beds were quite comfortable, coffeepot is single serve though. Views were not awesome (we saw a dentist at work in a nearby building), but we didn't spend time in room much (too much to do in the city). Macy's, Tiffany's, Neiman-Marcus, Saks are nearby for shoppers.High-speed internet is not free. Dining is expensive (as expected), but many restaurants nearby. We read other reviews enough to know to walk 1-2 blocks for $28 parking garage (instead of valet almost twice that). We didn't take advantage of an luxury elements of the hotel (young family). Service was good (able to change rooms when crying baby was nextdoor).All-in-all we selected a very good place with a hotel great chain. We would probably stay again."
198,2107,"Aug 11 2005	Loved our stay	We arrived in San Francisco late so we just booked a room at the airport for one night and head into the city the next morning. The Clarion Hotel at the airport was absolutely aweful! I would say if rated lower than a &quot;terrible&quot;. Hotel was dirty, room was small, smelled like smoke although we asked for a non-smoking room.,So it was a wonderful experience going to the Pan Pacific and being greeted by the valet. The concierge service was so helpful in getting a rental car and the room was fantastic. Breakfast was overpriced but what do you expect for a 4 star hotel.... Everything is always expensive. Enjoyed the down comforter in our room and the LCD. The location to Union square was great too. It was only 1 and 1/2 blocks away. We spent 2 days shopping and had a great time. Will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific next time we return to San Francisco."
