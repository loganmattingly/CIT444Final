292,244,"Jul 5 2007 	Excellent Hotel	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sofitel at the end of June and we are very pleased with the hotel. I would recommend getting the Priviledge Card, since they do upgrade your room. I had booked a standard King room on the lower levels of the hotel and they put us on the 21st floor with a great view. All staff members were very courteous and definitely wanted to make your stay as comfortable as possible. My only complaint is that they didn't tell us we paid for parking at the front desk and when we were leaving we paid the Valet guy and I was charged on my credit card for the parking as well. They reversed the charge on my credit card immediately though, without any hassle. All and all, excellent hotel to stay in!"
293,244,"Jul 5 2007 	Great hotel in an excellent location	We chose the Sofitel on the basis of previous experience in other cities and the reports on this site. We were not disappointed.The location is excellent, just a short walk from the main attractions, yet situated in a small square of restricted traffic. We were warmly welcomed, were pleased with our room and most impressed by the decor of the lobby and public areas.We chose to eat breakfast at the nearby Tempo cafe, enjoying delicious waffles (&quot;Morning Glory&quot;) and good service, so can't comment on the Sofitel dining experience.Our room was almost identical to that in the Sofitel New York and the bed as heavenly! We thought it was well equipped and mantained, but were disappointed that a broken window blind broke again immediately after a requested repair - no view for us (though we could have nagged for another repair, we didn't)On the last night of our stay, the hotel experienced a power outage. In our experience, such situations reveal a good deal about the ethos of the hotel and quality of staff. The way in which this unprecedented occurrence was handled was excellent, with all staff on hand to reassure, to offer assistance, candles and light sticks where possible. Since our room was on the 27th floor, we were pleased that the elevators remained in operation and the public areas were lit by emergency power. The air of calm, assured service and general good natured attitude said it all. This is a well run hotel who take their business seriously.We would return, indeed we would look forward to another visit.."
294,244,"Jun 19 2007 	Great hotel in a wonderful location	We have recently returned from a four night stay in Chicago and stayed in two different types of hotel, Flemish House for two nights and Sofitel for two nights, both were excellent in totally different ways. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Sofitel and booked it based on reviews on this website, we were not disappointed. I was a little nervous when I initially read a couple of adverse comments regarding security in the rooms, however this was never an issue. We were on the 26th floor and had a glimpse of the lake which was very pleasant, the room was very spacious, a wonderful large bed, very comfortable and a superb bathroom with a separate walk in shower. The location is excellent, within a five minute walk of Bloomindales, Macys, loads of restaurants and bars. The beach is also within easy walking distance. We used the fitness room in the hotel which was small but adequate. There is a small business centre on the 2nd floor which provides free internet access, great for keeping in touch and online check in. A good tip I read on Tripadvisor was to become a Sofitel Loyalty Customer, you get a free drink on the house which could be anything you fancy, my wife had a champagne cocktail for $14! There are also one or two other little extras like late check out. We did not eat in rthe restaurant as there is a wonderful little deli about 50 yards away called Guess, I think, next door to Cru, which was excellent. I would certainly recommend this hotel and we would stay there again if we went back to Chicago."
295,244,"Jun 17 2007 	Excellent Downtown Location and Beautiful Hotel	The Sofitel is minutes from the Hancock building, Michigan Ave, shopping, restaurants, and the bus, train or trolley. Within a short walk, you can go to the Water Tower visitor center to get all the info, brochures, &amp; maps you need for a trip. Buy a Go Chicago Card for discounts at museums and attractions.The high-rise hotel is beautiful, if not a tad expensive. Coffee in the only restaurant is five bucks. So go downstairs to the next door cafe or any of dozens of other cheaper places for meals. There is also a grocery store just to the south. They have no coffee maker in the room, but instead have a min-bar of soda, etc. There are no soda or snack machines, nor a stocked gift shop. These are the only negatives.The room and bath are large and the bed is great. It's clean and bright. We stayed a week and loved the location and never ate in the only restaurant because of the limited menu and cost. The same is true for the downstairs bar. But there were many pilots and stewardessess staying there so it's obviously the &quot;in&quot; place to be.We would stay there again and would recommend it for any age. Check out our picture of our room view, it was amazing!"
296,244,"Jun 10 2007 	Great 50th birthday!!	We went to Chicago for a surprise 50th celebration! We spent a fair amount of time researching where we wanted to stay. We booked 4 nights at the Sofitel and couldn't have been more pleased. The concierge helped us with several requests before we arrived (set up a limo, we even e-mailed the sign for the driver to hold!...and had a birthday basket made up!) The front desk personnel upgraded our room to one on the top floor with a beautiful view and even ran up to switch the basket, so that it would be ready for the surprise! The room was very comfortable and the bed...ah...heaven! We can't say enough nice things...the location was great...close enough to everything, yet quiet!We'd recommend this hotel to anyone and can't wait to go back!Restaurant Tips...For some great food, try Cafe 28, Keefers, Red Light . Fultons on the River, or Ditkas (right down the street!)."
297,244,"Jun 4 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	Wow. Fantastic hotel, excellent facilities. Stayed back in April en route to a wedding in Cleveland. Room was huge, we did book a suite which is actually about the size of 3 rooms. Very comfortable, bed to die for. HUGE bathroom and i mean huge. ate in the restaurant once and it was lovely. Breakfast has a lovely menu with lots to choose from.Fabulous hotel and definately worht all the good reviews"
298,244,"May 29 2007 	Relaxing weekend	With so much already said about this hotel, I don't think there's much I can add. But I can confirm all the great things said about the hotel. It's clean, modern, friendly, very service oriented, welcoming, well located, and a great value. The rooms were nice and the beds and bathrooms even better. One thing I could add is the extremely nice location of the hotel, which is central to everything. You have a five minute walk to Michigan Ave., and five minutes up and down Wabash get you to Rush St shopping/eating or Grand Ave. shopping/eating. We walked to Millenium Park and it took about 20 minutes, not too bad. You are surrounded by great restaurants and nice cafes.Like their other properties, this is a GREAT hotel!"
299,244,"May 22 2007 	LOVED the Sofitel- My FAV hotel	What a great hotel! This is now my favorite hotel in the city! From the friendly staff to the great service, the Sofitel is the place to be. I was able to dine in their restaurant, CdA and again the service here was impeccable. Not to mention the quality of the food as well as the presentation, the Chef here is amazing. I recommend dining at this hotel! The bar was a fun atmosphere and great for conversation too. Guestrooms were very spacious, awesome city views, comfortable beds and spacious bathroom. The hotel offers a luxury experience with a very warm and welcoming feeling. I can't say enough about this hotel and can't wait to stay here again!"
300,244,"May 16 2007	Security issue - I don't recommend this hotel	I stayed in this hotel during a business trip, and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar, a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet. Security was informed, but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them. After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident, despite the fact that I was a hotel guest. Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait.Long story short, I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone, anyone would have talked to me about it. I've since been on the phone with a manager, who promised to call me back once she researched the incident, and have yet to hear back, despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago. I expected more from this hotel."
301,244,"May 16 2007 	One of the nicer hotels we have stayed at in Chicago	We stay in Chicago for business or pleasure at least 3 or 4 times per year, and have stayed at a number of the hotels in the city that are more or less in this category of hotel. I think the Sofitel has a fantastic location and is one of the overall most comfortable of the hotels we have stayed at.There are other fancier, more decadent hotels. Others with more Chicago flair. Others with more amenities and more modern. But for just an all around great place to sleep and relax in between other things, the room was comfortable, relatively quiet, has good food - even the room service (which I find is often NOT the case even in some of the most expensive chain hotels), etc.The room was clean, great views of the city, and like I mentioned - location was exactly where I would think your average tourist would want to be and walkable to many things. The bathrooms were very nice, excellent water pressure, a tub and a shower, nice robes, good lighting. The beds super comfortable with a feathertop mattress. Room service (we had it for breakfast one day, and a late night snack another) was quite good.The rooms are an average size for a big city hotel and the electronics and tv were nothing fancy. But for comfort and location (two of the most important things on an average trip) I think this was a fabulous choice."
302,244,"May 15 2007 	Robbed In Our Sleep In Our Hotel Room	A nice hotel, nice room. We stayed at the hotel for one night for a wedding, only to experience every traveler's worst nightmare. Our room was broken into and robbed while we were sleeping. Cash, jewelry... to make matters worse, the hotel has refused to accept this incident occurred, in so many words accusing us of lying. Can you imagine anything worse? You wake up in the morning to find a purse by the door, cash emptied from your wallets, an expensive bracelet missing (a bracelet worn to the event that night -- so it clearly happened in the middle of the night). The lock interrogation report shows an entry into the room at 2am after we were sleeping. Yet the hotel has been unwilling to rectify this matter. We are lucky we weren't hurt. For the safety of those considering staying at this hotel, I highly recommend against it."
303,244,"May 12 2007 	typical Sofitel	Stayed here on very short notice. Plane delayed because of severe weather and all hotels around airport were sold out. Called the Sofitel, got the room. Sofitel made the best of a lousy situation. Staff friendly and accommodating. Rooms spotless and tastefully decorated. Lounge and restaurant very good. Would definitely stay there again."
304,244,May 7 2007 	Superb choice	This hotel could not be a better base from which to see Chicago. Perfectly positioned for shopping and some great restaurants. Hotel is classy and modern. Staff were great throughout. We checked in as soon as we arrived (11.00am.) Rooms were lovely - bathrooms great (all marble and walk in showers). Bar area is also lovely - nice touches like a fake but inviting log fire. I would not chose to stay anywhere else. Loved it.
305,244,"May 7 2007	Fabulous Service and Decor!	Since I moved to Chicago, I was always curious about the Sofitel since the architecture is so unique. The architecture is stunning since the top portion of the hotel protrudes out over the street. I had a bunch of friends in town, so I mentioned that they should look into staying at the Sofitel. I wound up staying there too. Our room was very comfortable, especially the bed since it had a down duvet. I loved the 24-hour room service, especially after a night on the town! This hotel doesn't come cheap, but I think it's worth the price. The modern, contemporary decor of the lobby is phenomenal, especially at night with the multi-colored lights and the lively yet comfortable atmosphere in Le Bar. I will be back to the bar and Cafe des Architectes, especially for dinner. The fillet and braised beef was delicious."
306,244,"May 5 2007	Great Hotel but several problems during stay	I stayed @ the Sofitel Water Tower from December 7 - 10, 2006. Very nice hotel, friendly staff, nice rooms, but several things happened during my stay that a hotel of this class should not have allowed to happen.The first night I was there, I was awakened @ ~12:15AM by housekeeping trying to get into the room. Seriously. They woman knocked on the door several times, then tried to open the door (which she couldn't, b/c I put the safety bar across). After several loud proclamations of &quot;Housekeeping,&quot; she finally left.At ~12:30AM, the room phone rang. It was the night manager who told me housekeeping was trying to get into the room to clean it, and that he thought I had moved to another room. I told him I had not, and that in fact I was still in the exact same room that I had checked into 5 hours ago. He proceeded to press the issue &amp; swore that I had gone to the front desk after checking in, requested another room, and then moved. Seriously. I told him once again that I had not and that I was, still, in fact, in the same room. Then he asked if my wife had switched rooms (which, of course, would mean that my wife was staying in another room, she didn't tell me, and I didn't notice when I went to bed). But there was one problem w/this hypothesis (besides the obvious problems already stated): I had flown into town early for business reasons; my wife would not be arriving until the following morning. So unless she switched rooms from 500 miles away, it was unlikely that occurred, either (she made the reservations, however, which is apparently why my buddy, the manager, decided to try that angle).But none of this was enough for the manager to believe that I did not switch rooms. He then proceeded to ask me to verify the last 4 numbers of the CC I used when I checked in. At this point I had enough, and told him, &quot;No.&quot; I told him it was bad enough that housekeeping tried to barge in after midnight. It was bad enough that, @ 12:30AM the manager was arguing with me over whether or not I switched rooms. It was bad enough that he decided to call a guest that late, but this was too much. I was not getting out of bed to further prove that I was still actually in the room for which I paid. I then asked him if I would be contacted about this again that night, and he finally apologized and said, &quot;No.&quot;The rest of the stay went fine until check out, at which point we realized that we had been double billed for one of the nights, and had also been charged for a dinner at the hotel restaurant (CAFE DES ARCHITECTES) when, in fact, we never ate @ the hotel restaurant (this dinner also apparently took place the night before my wife arrived). So the night manager that was convinced I was staying in two rooms was also the one in charge when the mystery dinner took place and when I was double billed. But I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say these were all honest mistakes.So why do I still recommend the hotel? Because it is nice, the rooms are clean, the exercise facilities are adequate, and the location is fine (not on the mile, but close enough). Also, everything was taken care of the following week by the hotel GM, who also comped the first night b/c of all the trouble I had. So in the end, everything worked out fine.I give 4 stars b/c a hotel of this caliber should be detail oriented enough that the problems that occurred during my stay simply should not have occurred. The night manager should have been able to realize that a clerical error must have been made, and made a note to ask me about the supposed room switch the next morning. He should not have tried to figure things out by calling me in the middle of the night. As for the bogus charges . . . well, these things happen. And they were taken care of. But a quality hotel should make sure these problems simply don't occur instead of fixing them via damage control later on.Bottom line: don't hesitate to stay @ Sofitel. But before you go to sleep, you might want to unplug your phone."
307,244,"May 5 2007	Great hotel in Chicago	Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007. Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile. Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist. Dinner at the restaurant was also good. Prices are reasonable. Room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago.Concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet."
308,244,"May 4 2007 	Fab rooms great service - you get what you pay for.	I've stayed at the hotel twice, once with business and the other during a short break with my wife. Superb service, excellent clean rooms and if you like the menu in the restaurant, tasty well presented food. This hotel is in an excellent location for the shops and as most of the good spots in Chicago are within walking distance it is such a good central point for any kind of trip.If there was a downside (and I struggle to come up with a genuine one) they could investigate trying to get greater water pressure in the showers (I was on 15th floor) however the water was hot so not a real issue.Excellent place and we will return again."
309,244,"May 2 2007 	Loved the Sofitel	My wife and I stayed at the Sofitel April 26-27, based on reviews we had read on the internet. Neither of us had ever stayed in a Sofitel and our difficult decision between it and the Omni came down to the Sofitel. The service and stay were both fantastic. Comfortable bed, beautiful bathroom and excellent location for Michigan Ave./Oak Street shopping.During out stay, we also enjoyed great coffee and desserts in the Cafe as well as the famous Sofitel Continental assortment of pastries and bread. Highly recommended!"
310,244,"Apr 25 2007	Great Stay!	Stayed at this Sofitel for one night for our anniversary. We have stayed at two other Sofitel's before (New York, Washington) and are always impressed with the service - this one was no exception. The room was clean and beautiful, the bed comfortable and service exceptional. Alerted to our anniversary, we found water and chocolate covered strawberries in our room. Thank you Sofitel for always being our failsafe place to stay."
311,244,"Apr 22 2007 	Incredible trip from the time the cab stopped til we checked out.	We had such a wonderful time here on our Anniversary trip. We arrived extremely early - and while we couldnt check in right away, they called me on my cell before noon to allow us to check in. The service was so wonderful - it was always like &quot;Welcome Back&quot;. The rooms were great, spacious with amazing shower heads. It was very clean for us. The concierge made us reservations at a great steak house - after being sent away by Ditka's (that's a different review) . All of the staff was courteous and prompt. Our iron did not work originally, so we called for a new one which they brought up quickly. They made our trip to Chicago amazing - and one we won't soon forget."
312,244,"Apr 15 2007 	Excellent standard as we would expect from Sofitel	Stayed at the Sofitel for 6 nights over Easter. Hotel was lovely, we had a non-smoking room on the 28th floor and it was spotlessly clean. Staff at the reception and concierge desks were always very helpful. Enjoyed several cocktails in the bar which was very nice. Only had breakfast in the hotel once as we did not particularly care for the choice of food. The position of the hotel is excellent only one block from Michigan Avenue and the shops! The John Hancock building is also very close and instead of going up to the Observatory we went to the Signature Lounge on the 96th floor for cocktails which was very nice. From here you get the same view across Chicago. There is a business area on the second floor with 3 computers and 2 printers and we were able to check-in online for our journey home and print off our boarding passes which was very handy. If returning to Chicago I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again."
313,244,"Apr 11 2007 	A great hotel	We stayed only for one night. A comfortable room with big bed and good decor. Very helpful staff (which we always struggle to find elsewhere). Good location, although a short cab ride from the blue subway line from O'Hare."
314,244,"Apr 10 2007	Nice location bad advice	We recently stayed at this hotel and have mixed feelings about it. The facility is nice but not as nice as some other Sofitels e.g. Philadelphia. It is better in terms of condition than Madrid, Geneve and some others. What bugged me was the way they kept saying, &quot;Our desk staff know everything about Chicago&quot; when they clearly did not. We had bad advice about outdoor markets, locations of attractions, and average time on the trains to the airport. It is nice but I think you can do better."
315,244,"Apr 9 2007 	Excellent hotel	Stayed at the Sofitel for two nights over Easter weekend. Very pleased with the room -- not huge, but big picture window and good city view, everything new and in excellent shape, trendy lights, and very impressive marble bathroom with separate stall shower and tub. A new flat screen television would be an improvement, but the TV was acceptable.The people at the reception desk were friendly, and the lobby is modern and interesting. The whole hotel has little touches of interesting decor and architecture that set it apart from the run of the mill hotel. My wife thought the fitness center was good -- the machines were top of the line.We only ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant, but the service was excellent and the food was quite good. The hotel is located a short distance from &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; shopping and Rush Street restaurants.I would almost certainly stay there again if we visit Chicago -- my wife and I thought it was a top flight hotel and worth the money."
316,244,"Apr 9 2007 	Great Hotel	The service is perfect, the concierge marvellous, our room clean but not very clean, smelt dirty, decoration of our room HORRIBLE, a lot of mirrows on the wall, very small room, nice bath, excellent bed theonly thing they dont use sheets only cover duvet and I dont like that, I prefer traditional cover sheet bed. Excellent location, for sure I will come back. Federico"
317,244,"Apr 3 2007 	great quick trip	great hotel with a wonderful staff . my 7 year old and i went to chicago to go to American Girl , which is right around the corner . great room on the 30 th floor . it was very clean and room service was good . they even had a good kids menu . the concierge was wonderful . nothing was a problem . the ohare airport was a nightmare . next time a will take my husbands advice and leave first thing in the morning ."
318,244,"Mar 18 2007 	Quality choice	Managed to change booking (paying a supplement) from Sofitel O'Hare to Water Tower thanks to very helpful Night Mgr at O'Hare.The Water Tower remains an excellent hotel - room given was smoking but not too bad. Funky, quality furniture with plenty of space and good fittings throughout. Comfortable and clean bed too. Truly a premium 4* hotel (the better rooms are definitely 5*). Restaurant (dinner - really enjoyed the franco-american style and the Starck-ish furniture) and breakfast both excellent and staff was polite and helpful. Location, of course, is also a plus point as you can walk to most shops and (in my case, sadly) central business meetings. I will be back."
319,244,"Mar 6 2007 	I love the Sofitel!	I have stayed at the Sofitel a handful of times in the last few months for business and I love it - so much so that we have a group of friends going for a weekend in Chicago and we're all staying there!It is always nice and clean, the rooms are modern, the front desk staff is very kind and proactive (asking if I need help to the room, do I need a cab, is there anything that would make my stay nicer, they noticed I've stayed before and tried to give me rooms with a different view each time, do I need help finding anything in the hotel or in the city, etc.).One of the things I love about the room is the bathroom - the separate shower and tub. It's nice when I'm there alone on business to relax in a bath if I want to. You can even walk just down the street to the water tower for shopping, or just to get some bath salts and come back to the room.I think the hotel is great and I have no complaints from any of my stays so far. The location is perfect for being around shopping, restaurants, etc. I have to take a cab to my office, but the doormen take care of that for me so it's easy enough that I just continue to stay there instead of somewhere closer to my office. All in all, I would highly recommend for either business or pleasure!"
320,244,"Feb 26 2007 	Great Francophone Hotel	Stayed at the Sofitel for 1 night on a quick business trip Everything was nice but the staff was particularly exemplary. More than a few individuals went out of their way to ensure everything was to my satisfaction. Loved the French accents, the &quot;Bonjour&quot; wake-up call, and the surprisingly strong bread program in the restaurant. The food in CdA was also quite good for a quick lunch--the $21 four-plate special is worth ordering.Bathrooms are nicer than the rooms themselves with, as others have noted, stand-alone bath and shower. Room was fine, a bit small, but very comfortable bed. Just short of truly luxurious. $10/day for internet was a bit unfair, but no real complaints. Very chic hotel."
321,244,"Feb 18 2007	Great place in a great location	As cold as it was in Chicago, we still managed to have a great time, underwritten as that usually is by the quality of our lodgings.The euro-chic approach of the sofitel is familiar to urbane British travellers, but it was still a delight to check in to a stylish lobby and then discover the spacious room we had been given.You could'nt quite see the Hancock tower from the room, but the view wasn't terrible.In keeping with what you would expect of a French hotel, the room was well appointed, the staff polite and discreet and the clientele seemed quite colourful, much as we kept ourselves to ourselves as we explored the city and spent too much on taking advantage of the strength of Sterling.A 2 minute walk to Michigan Avenue, a proper local cafe and supermarket on the same block - the location was perfect.I think the reason this gets 5 stars has to be the fact they have the most comfortable beds, a complicated construction of layers, but do they ever do the job in ensuring a restful nights sleep."
322,244,"Feb 17 2007 	Terrific service	First visit to Chicago. Just a quick February weekend of shopping, restaurants and music. The Sofitel location is superb with the amazing restaurants of Rush St. and the stores on Michigan Avenue within walking distance. The biting winds and brutal cold kept walking to a minimum unfortunately.The hotel staff are amazing. The &quot;Architecture&quot; restaurant served a first class breakfast. Everything's baked on premises. Beds are great and the robes and towels are Turkish cotton.Only downsides: had to change rooms because of a plumbing problem and the $10 per day wi-fi fee is silly given the hotel's price point and the fact that it's free at the Holiday Inn. I would definitely return."
323,244,"Feb 16 2007	The Little Things.....	Stayed at the Sofitel for one week and I would definitely go back.  The staff are superb, friendly and very helpful. I had one problem in my room, I was moved right away and given a complimentary breakfast. The beds have a fluffy feather pillow top and great pillows. The comforter cover is changed every day and the toiletries are luxurious. I took the hand cream home, it is from France and smells yummy. The bathroom was my favourite, large tub, stand alone shower. The nightly turn-down service includes fresh towels and bottled water. The little added touches really gave this place a Spa feel. The breakfast daily was 5 star, best Eggs Bennedict I've had. Get the pastry basket, they bake up some of the best croissants and baguettes - very addicting. I don't think you will find a better breakfast nook in the city (we tried!). We went out for dinner so I can't comment on the restaurant, but I did have room service one evening. My only complaint here was the price, pizza and salad for one was $ 40.00 with tip. Mind you, the portion could easily have fed a small army, they should have smaller options for those having &quot;dinner for one&quot;. The Hotel lounge/bar was very cozy, they serve complimentary cheesy crackers and olives.  Location is great; one block from Michigan Ave and about 3 blocks from Rush St. Walgreens and Starbucks are minutes away. For dinner, you have to venture out to Rush street, this is the trendy restaurant area - you will have an abundance of places to choose from. The Lux, Gibsons, Carmines, The Big Bowl- my favourite...too many to mention, but it is a fun area. Great City, Great Food and Great Service - Enjoy!"
324,244,"Feb 11 2007 	My Home Away From Home	I live in Chicago, but my home was under construction so I needed a place to stay for a week until the contractor completed the task at hand. The Sofitel appealed to me on several levels: it's contemporary, it's in a great location surrounded by excellent restaurants, it's pet friendly (so I was able to bring Fido), and the hotel restaurant is excellent. In fact, I typically have breakfast there every Sunday. However, before booking the room, I considered my options and previewed rooms at several other pet friendly hotels (within the same price range) in the neighborhood. I decided on the Sofitel because the room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The marble clad bathroom featured a separate tub and shower, the bed was very comfy and the staff is attentive and extremely friendly. For tourists, in my opinion, the location is great. You are in close proximity to shopping, entertainment, parks, transportation, museums, houses of worship, etc. Also, the hotel has an intimate bar that attracts both guests and locals. It's a laid back atmosphere that doesn't necessarily feel like a hotel, yet the service and amenities are great. One more thing, if you didn't bring a laptop, there's a complimentary business center for net surfing. Enjoy!"
325,244,"Feb 8 2007 	Wonderful Welcoming Touches	This is a lovely modern hotel with a French accent. We used the pay-in-advance option on thier website and spent $165/night on a Saturday. I am glad that I took the time to join the Privilege club online -- it was worth it. They upgraded our room, which was fantastic and had a big marble bathroom and sitting area. They also sent up chocolate-covered strawberries and special water (both fizzy and still) shortly after we checked in. Along with a welcome note, they gave us a coupon for a free drink, which we had in the lobby to avoid the smokey bar. We ordered room service for breakfast and it was very yummy -- especially the savory crepes. It is a great place to stay for a romantic night away! We were impressed with the generous welcome and the service. We would definitely go back, especially at that price."
326,244,"Feb 1 2007 	Soffitel is marvelous	We have stayed in the Sofitel in New York on our way out of the country for a couple of nights, which was just a splendid hotel. To my suprise, the hotel in Chicago was just as good as New York. I have never found that in a chain hotel.The beds are something you would find in a 5 star hotel, the rooms with the orchids are just lovely. I would go back in a minute."
327,244,"Jan 30 2007 	Excellent Stay	My wife and I stayed at the Sofitel January 25th and thought the property was perfect. Asthetically, the hotel was great. Our room (king superior on the 22nd floor) was amply sized and modernly appointed. We were so amazed at the efficient use of space in the wonderful bathroom (which included both a tub and a separate walk-in shower) that we plan on remodelling our bathroom at home in a similar layout. The location put us right where we wanted to be for shopping as well as within a short cab ride to the many great restaurants. The staff was extremely gracious which added to the quality of our stay. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was to be welcomed back to the hotel upon returning from shopping, dinner, etc. The only downside I see is that there is a high-rise condo building being constructed on the northeast corner of the intersection where the hotel sits which when finished will likely obscure much of hotel's lake view. One last observation--as we were not sure if we were going to be able to make the trip, I had initially booked a refundable rate of $195 per night directly with the hotel. The night before we were to arrive I found a non-cancellable rate of $165 per night on Orbitz. I called the hotel to inquire whether they would match the rate and although they acknolwedged that that rate should not have been available on Orbitz as it was the day before the arrival date and non-cancellable rates typcially become unavailable 2-3 days prior to arrival, they matched the rate which meant I didn't have to go through the trouble of cancelling my reservation with the hotel and then re-booking through Orbitz. A nice gesture. Bottom line--excellent stay at a great price."
328,244,Jan 28 2007 	Lived Up to Reviews	I probably spent hours looking at reviews before making a reservation at Sofitel. It was my birthday and my husband and I decided to splurge for an evening (also our first night away from the baby!). So I really wanted to pick the best hotel. We booked a king superior room for $165. We told them it was my birthday and when we checked in they had upgraded us to an executive king.THE FEEL OF THE HOTEL: Very upscale and modern. Noone was rude. But as I young couple w/o much cash - we really didn't fit in. A lot of suits and I found the architecture lacking in personality and character. THE ROOM: Executive king. Beautiful!! So inviting and warm. Large enough for a huge desk and a pull-out loveseat. The bathroom was HUGE and gorgeous. Bath tub was a bit small. Big fluffy robes. Marble everything. Best bathroom in a hotel I've seen. The bed was UNBELIEVABLE.ROOM SERVICE: Fantastic! Delicious!I could've stayed in that room for a week w/o leaving.
329,244,"Jan 22 2007 	The BEST hotel in Chicago!!!	We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel. We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. We've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt, The Peninsula, and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all. It's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. It's a beautiful hotel all the way around. Staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. They were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. The common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. My wife loved the huge tub. We had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. The robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated.The property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. Want a Bentley or latte? They're all close by.This was our second stay since it opened and I'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago."
330,244,"Jan 19 2007 	Wonder for Business 	Stayed in Chicago on business in early December and my husband joined me to make a weekend out of the trip. The Sofitel is a contemporary, architectural beauty. The rooms are nicely decorated and the bathrooms are of nice size. I fell in love with the lotion that they provided and it was such a treat to soak in a large bathtub. Bottles of Evian water at turn down and a room cleaning twice a day spoiled me completely. Internet service, provided by T-mobile, was a snap.The staff was wonderful!! My husband's luggage was delayed so the Concierge made him a small amenities bag that included shaving balm and all.Le Bar was quite trendy and had the best martinis. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant is a bit pricey so I'd suggest walking up the street to Starbuck's.The hotel is in a great location (There's a McCormick &amp; Schmick's right across the street if you are really hungry). Water Tower mall, John Hancock building, Cheesecake Factory and the Magnificent Mile are a block away. I was in heaven (did I mention that I'm headed there again on Sunday - work?!)There is no pool as everyone states but are you really going to Chicago to swim? I think not."
331,244,"Jan 18 2007 	Absolutely Fabulous Hotel - Loved it	I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. The rooms are spacious, great beds, pillows and linen. The bathroom has a great shower and bath. WiFi works really well and the desk is large. The staff are wonderful. The location is great for shopping, spa's, Starbucks and hairdressers. I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it."
332,244,"Jan 17 2007 	Top notch	We've just had 4 wonderful days at the Sofitel. Used the Fairmont before which was nice, but the combination of good rates and luxury are hard to beat. We were upgraded to aDeluxe room on 30th floor. Lovely large room , super bathroom, and the service was impeccable throughout. Breakfats great too and for us ( from the UK ) it was cheap at $35 for two. Very, very good. We'll be going back"
333,244,"Jan 11 2007 	Still want to be there!	My husband and I just got back from a two-night stay at the Sofitel and loved every minute of it. Everyone there, from the bellboy to the desk clerks, was helpful, knowledgeable and as nice as could be. Our room was beautiful, loved the bathroom and the fabulous view. The only tiny negatives were that I found a used (but washed) tissue in one of our blankets that housekeeping didn't catch, and that the hotel doesn't include any kind of breakfast in the morning. The restaurant in the hotel serves breakfast, which we had this morning (delicious), but it's quite expensive. Back on a positive note, the hotel's location is incredible; we walked everywhere the whole three days and didn't even need to get back into our car. There are great restaurants all around the neighborhood, and the bar in the hotel is very romantic and fun. I highly recommend this hotel!"
334,244,"Jan 5 2007	Near perfection	I stayed here in the fall of 2006, and having stayed at other hotels in Chicago afterwards, I now appreciate the Sofitel immensely. Quite simply, it's one of the best hotel in the city.Check in was fast and efficient, yet executed with grace. My room was large, attractive, immaculate, and soundproof. Service went beyond the call of duty. For example, when I got a pair of pants wet, housekeeping agreed to put them in their dryer for me.There were a few flaws, such as the way one of my closet doors opened onto a hole in the wall or my inability to get a cell connection in my room, but these things were minor.Just one tip: the demographic at this hotel was very evenly middle aged, so as a late twenties couple, my girlfriend and I felt a little out of place. So the hotel was great for everyone, but you may get the most enjoyment if you are in your fourth or later decade."
335,244,"Dec 27 2006	Great Hotel All Round	We stayed at this hotel in December with our 2 young kids for a weekend away. It was a terrific choice. The room was huge, clean, and comfortable, and the kids loved it. They had a separate pull out sofa which became a very comfortable bed. The breakfast was a taste of France and the girls loved it. The wait staff was very kind and the i girls could not wait to go back for the 2nd morning there. The gym was clean and very well equipped and the hotel was perfectly located. All in all, it was a beautiful hotel and we would not hesitate to go back again. We certainly would like to stay in other Sofitel locations (we stayed at the NY hotel in 2005 and also thought it was great) as this hotel definitely set a standard for us."
336,244,"Dec 24 2006 	Always Excellent	My husband and I stay at the Sofitel whenever we are looking for a romantic evening away - fantastic every time - great location, great rooms, great service, great breakfast"
337,244,"Dec 16 2006 	Sumptuous Sofitel	Great location, great service, and comfortable rooms make this a superb Sofitel for business or pleasure. I had a nice suite on an upper floor with excellent views. The bedroom area of the suite (with a separate temperature control) was comfortable and easily closed off from the living and work area as well as from the entry. The well-equipped bathroom was a pleasure, and within 2 minutes of my request, a small tube of toothpaste was brought to the room. The 24/7 fitness center is small but functional and features state-of-the art cardiovascular equipment. Towels, apples and water are provided and the room is nicely finished. I didn't find it crowded, using it three times over 2 days. The bar area can be a bit smoky, even with the new ordinance in effect because it is small. But, there is another bar in the restaurant which is quite nice. It's a short walk to the best shopping between the coasts, and plenty of restaurants to choose from. Hotel staff are extremely friendly and responsive to any request. Check in was efficient and it's nice to be greated with a &quot;bon jour&quot; (or &quot;bon soir&quot;) no matter where you are in the world."
338,244,"Nov 26 2006 	Wonderful stay in Chicago	We have just come back from a wonderful five night stay at the Sofitel Water Tower over the Thanksgiving period. The door and reception staff were fantastic and we got a fantastic room on the 19th floor overlooking the gold coast area apartments. The building itself is a very unusual design which looks like a glass shard and is quite distinctive.The room was huge with a spacious bathroom and a wonderful floor to ceiling window, a desk area and a nice modern chaise long. The bathroom has a seperate tub and shower and wonderful Roger and Gallet bath products.Each night there is a turn-down service with a nice bottle of Evian provided for you. Housekeeping are very friendly and efficient and if you tip them well you get plenty of extra bath products. Gowns and slippers are provided for you.The bar area is nice with an open fire and comfortable sofas. The lobby area is nice also but it would have been nice to have a larger lounge area so you could sit without requiring a drink to be bought.Overall it was a fantastic stay and the staff cannot do enough for you.I would recommend renting bikes from Millenium Park as we did and had a wonderful day and a great persepective of the city from the fantastic Lake cycling path.Looking forward to going to another Sofitel soon."
339,244,"Nov 7 2006 	Loved the Sofitel!	I stayed at the Sofitel from August 27 - September 1, 2006. I am originally from Chicago, and relocated to Las Vegas. So knowing the competition of Vegas hotels compared to other hotels, I think that the Sofitel is very comparable to the beautiful and invitiing hotels in Vegas.  We were on the top floor, and had a view of the lake. It was beautiful! The room was the cleanest room that I have ever stayed in. I cannot say enough about the bed, the closet, and the bathroom. First of all, the bed, duvet covers, and pillows were so soft and fluffy, and clean. I'm very picky about bed spreads and blankets in hotels. I usually don't use them, because everyone that has stayed in that room uses the same blankets and bed spreads. The Sofitel changes the linens daily, so you know that they are clean. It was so comfortable, I didn't want get up.The bathroom was so large, and had a separate glass shower and bathtub. The shower and the sink area were quite large, and had generous space to put your toiletries. The floors were beautiful marble.The closet was spacious, and had shelves and hangers, and when the closet door opened, it lit up. Also, the nightly bed turn down was nice, with bottles of water, weather forecasts, etc.The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. They helped me with car rental, tours and transportation. I would recommend the breakfast in the cafe. The bakery items are made there, and the waffles were to die for.I guess you can see that I loved the Sofitel, and would recommend it highly. It is worth every penny!"
340,244,"Nov 7 2006 	Fantastic Hotel but there is not a swimming pool	We stay at this hotel all of the time when visiting Chicago (3 times per year)...I'll stay at no other....I've even moved from the Peninsula back to the Sofitel. We have 3 small children and always stay in the 1 bedroom suite....it is like a luxry Chicago apartment with stunning views of the city and the John Hancock Bldg. The staff is outstanding and the location cannot be beat! Area restaurants and in house food are excellent. I went to highschool right around the corner from this place and truly believe this is one of Chicago's best kept secrets.However, to clarify there is NO swimming pool (not that I care)....but there is a recent review claiming there is one. I even called the place to inquire and they confirmed &quot;No&quot;....It is a 31 story building not 44....I don't know where the other reviewer stayed but it wasn't the Sofitel Water Tower."
341,244,"Oct 29 2006 	Great Hotel - Wonderful Staff	After spending four nights at the Sofitel I cannot think of one aspect of my stay that was not excellent. From the friendliness of the staff to the food at the restaurant to the comfort of the room -- everything exceeded expectations. The location of the hotel is an added bonus - on quieter streets that most of the other top hotels in the area, and close to the red el line as well as Michigan Ave and Oak St. Very easy to get around the city from this location. The staff was exceedingly gracious and cooperative, the room very comfortable and the bed particularly terrific. Would highly recommend this hotel."
342,244,Oct 27 2006	Swimming Pool	I tiik my dad away on a 10 day whrllwind trip of the states oncluding 2 nights in Chicago.Got a great deal on hotwire paying about $170 dollers a night.Hotel was excellent but just wanted to say that there is a fantastic swimming pool on the 42nd floor of the hotel which is next to the gym.It does not seem to be mentioned anywhere else and one review mentions the abscence of a pool.I can asure you there is one there i used it every day after a tough day on foot sightseeing and the view from the pool is stunning!
343,244,"Oct 25 2006 	Lived up to its Tripadvisor status!	Beautifully appointed, professionally staffed, comfortable, well-located, and elegant, with wireless internet access (plus free access in an alcove on the second floor), fitness center (a little small but fine if you use it at the right time), good energy clientele, easy access to Michigan Avenue, next door to 24-hour restaurant, 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks, elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything. Will definitely return!"
344,244,"Oct 5 2006	Sofitel is not great	My daughter and I spent a week at the Sofitel in May. I had watched Tripadvisor for quite a while and it was for those months rated number one so I thought it would be worth the splurge. The room was no nicer than any Holiday Inn. The location is pretty convenient and the lobby is cool in a sort of retro way. After we checked in we asked for a better view and were told none was available.I have stayed previously in the Chicago Omni and the Wyndham, both of which are more centrally located and both were a better experience. I've also stayed at the Omni Ambassador, which was kind of creepy except for the Pump Room."
345,244,"Sep 10 2006 	Wonderful Experience	We arrived at the Sofitel ready to check-in, and possiblly receive an upgrade. We were greeted and later informed that they did not have a double room ready for us (this was at about 5:00pm). We were offered two complimentary drinks and some snacks while we were waiting for our room or to accpet a king room with no wait. No problem for us, we had the drinks (which would have been $12 each for a martini) and then made our way upto the room. I loved the decor of the hotel, very modern and relaxing. I'm not sure what the room rate was, as we were not paying and traveling on business. We were placed in room #602, which was on the lower floors and really didn't have a view. I asked to be assigned another room and we were told they were full. Complimentary comuters are located on the 2nd and 3rd floors, therefore don't purchase an in-room Wifi or ehternet connection unless you would like the added privacy. The bathroom was very spacious and had a walk-in shower, seperate soaking tub and large vanity with high quality towels and bath products. The Beds were super comfortable (I'll tell you now that I am a very picky prerson for when it comes to beds in hotels and this hotel exceeded my expectations. The fitness center could have been nicer, I found it very dark and stuffy, however it contained a large collection of stregth and weight equipment along with cardio machines equiped with personal viewing monitors, wery nice. Check-out was efficent and quick. I highly reccomend that Sofitel Chicago."
346,244,"Sep 8 2006 	What a great base for exploring Chicago	I Stayed here for three nights at the beginning of September. I was on vacation on my own.I had heard some shaky reviews after I'd booked my stay but before I went, so I left the UK with a little trepidation. I could not have been more pleased with the hotel. Checking in was a pleasant experience with the offer of bottles of water with my privilege card. My room on the 22nd floor was ready immediately and was fairly spacious. The bathroom made it for me with a seperate shower unit as well as a bath.I went down to the bar and was met by some of the friendliest people I've ever met ( I'm talking about the staff rather than the clientele). They enquired about my stay and as soon as I stated I was on my own and had never been to Chicago before they were more than eager to advise me as to not only the major attractions but also some good local tips in respect of restaurants, bars and shopping. I was even taken outside to be shown the various directions and streets to take in respect of these tips, and to allow me to get my bearing on things. This continued throughout my stay with constant feedback from me about the places they'd directed me too and further tips from them.The concierge was also more than helpful, organising golf for me and also coming to my rescue with a taxi when i became stranded at the golf culb, quite some miles out of town.The gym is small, but more than adequate for an inner city hotel. There are plenty of machines and it wasn't too busy. I only ate breakfast in the hotel which was adequate, but nothing to write home about. All other meals were taken outside the hotel at venues given to me by the bar staff.The hotel is in a prime location. You're a block away from all the shops on michigan avenue with rush street and its bars and clubs only a few blocks in the other direction. There's a cta station around the corner making it ideal for exploring the city. The hotel staff advised me it was more than safe to walk around on my own in this area and they were right; as not once did I feel threated or intimidated even though I was walking around on my own at night. I really enjoyed this hotel and the staff in particular were more than helpful, enabling me to experience the real chicago and not just the usual tourist attractions. I'd definately go back!"
1,251,Room and service was horrible	When we arrived at the hotel we were properly greeted and taken up to our rooms. When we got into our room the furniture inside was stained and really beat up. The worst part of the room was the bathroom door. The bathroom was fitted with a sliding door that did not go into the wall but alongside it. The door had no lock and left about a 2-3 inch gap where if you walked by it you could see someone on the toilet. The concierge was not helpful on suggestions of restraunts or nightlife. The concierge told us that we were better off staying in our rooms since there was &quot;nothing to do in chicago after 10 pm&quot;. Our last night we ordered a movie and the quality of the movie was horrid (movie was pixelating and blurry) so we called down and I had to argue with the person at the front desk to have them credit us the money back for the movie after we had stopped it less than 5 minutes in. This is not a full service hotel we had to pay about 10 bucks for anything and everything. We had to pay about 12 dollars to have them bring us up extra glasses since the old ones were dirty and the maid did not switch them out. The only redeeming thing about my trip was the fun I had with my friends not the hotel.
2,251,Nov 14 2009 	Great Place to stay	I have stayed at this hotel twice in the past two months. It is south of the mile across from the park which makes it a much quieter place. It is only a few minute cab ride or walk up to the action on the mile or over on State. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are nice. One of the nice things is that it is a smaller hotel (compared to the Hilton next door and the other convention size places) and that makes for a really nice stay without the convention crowds in the lobby.
3,251,"Nov 13 2009 	Lovely hotel convenience of location depends on the traveler...	I stayed at the Blackstone A Renaissance Hotel for two nights for a short getaway. The plan was to do a little sightseeing, shop, and visit Harpo Studios as an audience member =). The hotel is lovely. The building is just breathtaking (though the interior is a bit too modern and does clash). The rooms were a very nice size with a huge marbled bathroom. The bed was comfortable, there is a large flat panel TV, wireless (which is not free and just overpriced), and a Starbucks located right in the hotel (though that staff just did not know what theyre doing so it really was not that much of a bonus) . It really is just a beautiful hotel. Servicewell, to be very honest the check in staff was a bit uppity. I found the female employees to be rather rude upon check in, so I really didnt feel like asking them anything. The doormen were incredibly, wonderfully helpful and kind as was the cleaning staff. Im sure service is fine at the Blackstone, but we were really put off by the tone when we arrived. However, this does not make or break a persons stay. I think I can put up w/ just about anything as long as Im in a clean room w/ a good location. And location is something you need to seriously consider before booking your stay at the Blackstone. I think to get to Harpo Studios the location is fine. Its a $12 (tip included) cab ride to the show. If youre visiting the Chicago Art Museum or Millennium or Grant Park its a ten minute walk. To Chicago OHare airport its a good 30 minutes by taxi at $40 (tip included), or 1 hour 20 minutes by metro (only recommend using during the day, have to change lines after first stop) for $2.00. However, if you want to be in the middle of things (and I think we all do!) you should not stay at this hotel. I think that if travelers should stay at the hotels located on the Magnificent Mile, where all the restaurants and shops are. Hotels over there are also a ten minute walk from the parks and museums. The Blackstone, while lovely and comfortable, is just not as conveniently located as other hotels with the same rate or lower. At night, being two women alone in the city, we felt a little more weary in this location. Also, normally on my trips I prefer taking a citys metro/subway  its just a great way to save money! On this trip we didnt do that despite the close location of the metro (5 minute walk). Even walking from the metro to our hotel in the day we felt a little unsafe, so we sure werent going to take it at night! But, to reiterate, this is a lovely hotel just wasnt a convenient enough location and not enough shops or restaurants around."
4,251,"Nov 10 2009 	Like a hotel you would see in the movies	I was blown away by this hotel. It was absolutely gorgeous! My taxi driver commented (and I'm not sure if this is true or not) that the hotel was completely remodeled a few years ago, which initially made me feel a bit skeptical. But once I walked into the lobby, I knew I liked the place. I really liked the style of the rooms (very modern with a fun color scheme). The beds were comfortable and had quality linens. The bathroom had cool lighting and a great shower. If I were back in Chicago, I would definitely stay here again."
5,251,"Nov 4 2009 	Enjoyable stay.	I stayed at the Blackstone for 5 nights during October.Overall, I was pleased with the hotel. The staff are friendly and the facilities still look fairly new. The dcor did not bowl me over (not to my taste) but it was clean and that's the main thingThe room faced the park and lake, so it was nice to wake up to a view each morning. I did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants but did have room service. Service was prompt but what gets to me is the automatic 20% service charge. I realise it's a standard at all the Marriott's I have stayed in but I don't have to like it. The room was a good size but some things left me puzzled. I assumed it was a room kitted out for people with a disability/mobility issues (given the size of the bathroom and low hanging hooks and rails) but some things (like having a bathtub) did not make sense. I did not like the low hanging rail in my room as I could not hang anything long up. I also thought the light switches were a pain. Instead of one switch, each light had 2 dials to fiddle with and it wasn't obvious (at least to me) how to control them. I just kept pressing until something happened. The room was also furnished with a low chair/high desk combo. It might look good but I did not find it practical for either eating or working.The only thing not acceptable was the cleanliness of the towels. Everyday I was given new towels and without fail, there was always at least one in the pile that was stained. The hotel is within walking distance from a number of attractions and transport options. In honesty, I would probable stay at a more centrally located hotel on a future visit."
6,251,"Nov 4 2009 	Great hotel in South Loop - convenient to Soldier's Field	My husband and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary in Chicago. I got him tickets to the Bears-Browns game on Nov. 1st. I booked the Blackstone because it was convenient to Soldier's Field. On a previous trip to Chicago, I stayed up at River North and I really liked it there. The locaion on S. Michigan ave is great for South Loop attractions like Grant Park, The Museums, and Could Gate, and of course, is within walking distance to Soldier's field. It is a bit of a walk if you want to go up North to Magnificent Mile, but it's pretty convenient to most of the subway lines, including the Loop. The back side of the hotel is a bit lonely at night, especially on weekends. We walked to Lou Malnatti's pizzeria for a late dinnerwhich is only about 3 blocks away, but the street was a little eerie late at night. During the day, it is fine though. It's a convenient short train ride to Lou Mitchell's as well, which is a wonderful place for breakfast. The hotel itself has a dimly-lit refurbished lobby. The hallways however, were nice and bright. We told the staff upon checking in that we were celebrating an anniversary and they said they upgraded our room. We were on the 20th floor overlooking some of the South Loop. Was hoping for a park view, but oh well! Not a big deal. Our room had a king bed, which was super comfy. The room is about average size. I am from NYC so I am used to very small spaces. The bathroom was wonderful and modern, equipped with an in-mirror TV, which for some reason didn't get the exact same channels as the TV in the room. There is a standing shower only, with a rain shower head which was lovely. There are Aveda toiletries as well. Room is decorated in a modern, minimalist theme, but overall, very comfortable. Service was fine. We didn't really hang around the hotel too much but check in and check out was very smooth.Another great breakfast place which is just a few blocks south on S. Michigan Ave, is Yolk. It gets really crowded too, especially before a Bears game! But it is delish. Overall, very happy with the Blackstone, but I found that the rates for the hotel were slightly higher than some of the equal-star rated hotels up on River North. Not sure if it was because of the Bears game (there were a lot of people attending the game who stayed at the hotel), but overall a pleasant stay. I would stay here again if I had to be in the South Loop. BTW, we used the gym and it had very modern equipment, and larger than I expected, which was great!"
7,251,"Oct 29 2009 	Outstanding service and accommodations	We stayed in late October while in Chicago for a wedding. The staff here is excellent, very service oriented and very friendly. We had a city view room on the 19th floor. The rooms are very clean and have cool contemporary look, glass walled showers, etc. The bedding is luxurious. Nice flat screen TV, etc. What really made them standout was on Sunday when we were set to go home, our flight was cancelled. We needed to stay another night. We had booked the rooms at a &quot;cheap&quot; rate over the internet. I thought they would really stick it to me to stay another night without the internet rate. They didn't do that. Instead the gave me a LOWER rate and UPGRADED my room to a suite looking over Grant Park. Unreal. It turned a bad thing (getting our flight cancelled) into an enjoyable extra night in Chicago."
8,251,"Oct 21 2009 	I will be back!	Just spent three days and two nights at this lovely hotel and practically had to pry the two children (6 and 10) out with a crowbar. The staff was welcoming and gracious, the room was large and beautiful and the fireworks from Navy Pier both nights pretty much ensured we would always pick a lakeside room. I have paid the same amount per night for a tiny room with no view in NYC so this was a real treat. We ate breakfast cheaply at both the Corner Bakery and the Chicago Carry-Out next to the Travelodge and enjoyed fabulous tacos at Flacos Tacos so sadly did not try the restaurant at the Blackstone, which would have been unappreciated by children anyway!"
9,251,"Oct 19 2009 	Solid Service	This is an older hotel that has been refurbished. Staff works hard to provide outstanding service. Rooms were nice but small compared to more modern hotels. Very close to Field Museum, Shed Aquarium, etc. Good for couples! Glad my kids stayed at home."
10,251,"Oct 18 2009 	Awesome hotel great service	Great hotel and the service was out of this world. Great workout facilities, excellent location near parks, clean, rooms with character. Here was the clincher for me....my wife and I went out running in the morning. Walking in the door, the front desk person - Jordan, asked us to hold for a minute. He then ran and got us ice cold bottled water and cold towels. Later we used his intimate knowledge of Chicago to find places to eat and entertainment. Fantastic property."
11,251,"Oct 18 2009 	Classic Renaissance	Typical or classic Renaissance hotel. Refurbed older property. Lobby a little dark common for older property. But room was great, clean and modern. Bathroom was also large. Inroom iPod radio a plus. This is what I expect from this chain. Friendly front desk. Unique bar in basement was very cool. Good value for business but for tourists it is a long walk to Miracle Mile. Close to stadium. Overall great choice for overnight business trip"
12,251,"Oct 15 2009 	The Blackstone Hotel	Awesome hotel. Excellent service, beautiful view and the Tapas restaurant is amazing."
13,251,Oct 9 2009 	Amazing	We are in Chicago for just one night but wanted to get a location central to the Shedd and Field Museum. We couldn't have done better! Beautiful room and friendly staff! We weren't expecting a lake view room and got up graded. It is amazing to look out into the harbor and see the boats. Truely beautiful!
14,251,"Oct 6 2009 	Incredible Fantastic Beautiful Wonderful	We arrived on Saturday and requested an upper floor, lake view room. We stayed in room 1918, which is a corner room looking out on Lake Michigan. It was beautiful. Clean, bright and very roomy. It exceeded all expectations. Being directly on Michigan Avenue we expected some road noise. There was very little. There was also no noise from the other guests. Zero. This hotel is beautifully appointed. The staff was incredibly helpful and welcoming. The bed was very comfortable. The only negative was feather pillows and no extra blanket in the room. I know every upscale hotel has feather pillows, and it is very hard to get foam. I still slept very good because the bed was so comfortable. Room service was so so. The prices are very high and you must be very specific on what you want. We ordered coffee with cream and got milk. Not too tragic, however, when you pay $15.00 for coffee with cream, and it takes 1/2 hour, at least give me cream. The hotel restaurant wasn't too good for dinner, but has a wonderful breakfast. The 2 eggs any style are a fantastic deal. Worth it. We went to see the Chicago Bears game and ended up walking to Soldier Field. We ended up walking to our destinations and cabbing back after dinner etc. It is in a great location for seeing the city."
15,251,"Oct 5 2009 	Unexpected luxury	The Hotel: I was there for a 4-night stay which qualified me for an upgraded corner room overlooking Michigan Avenue and Grant Park on the 17th floor, plus a $50 voucher for room service or the onsite restaurant. Those were very nice perks. As for service, they loaned my friend and I umbrellas for walking around downtown and were. The size and cleanliness of my room was excellent. it had carrerra marble baths and a unique room layout, making it feel spacious. The hotel itself is classic and well built with ornate details throughout. The gym has many newer machines and treadmills and lots of them. I've never seen so many guests working out at 6AM as I did at the Blackstone.Negatives: Wireless internet was $13 plus a dollar tax in room, but free in the lobby. That was barely convenient for checking email.The location: Very good for walking to Millennium park, the Art Institute to the north, and even the Field Museum and Soldier Field to the south. Taxi rides make things much easier, and getting to the Cubs game was no problem via walking to the nearest red line station. For a leisurely breakfast, try &quot;Yolk&quot; just south a few blocks. The variety of breakfast food was impressive."
16,251,Sep 29 2009 	Great room and location with friendly staff	Was in Chicago for a long weekend and loved this hotel. Would definitely return. The rooms were spotless and nicely renovated it was contemporary with the charm of an older hotel. The staff was awesome they upgraded us to lakeview free of charge since rooms were available. We got a good deal on the room and would definitely recommend this hotel.
17,251,"Sep 29 2009 	Excellent Staff Beautiful Rooms - Gorgeous Hotel with history	Along with a hoard of other kind folks, I stayed here for the U2 shows at Soldier Field. I can't think of anything to complain about! Everything was amazingly well done by a professional &amp; courteous staff. The restoration is beautiful, and the employees are proud of their property (deservedly so!).ah, I thought of something to complain about:The queen beds in my room were fantastic! The plush, top-notch bedding &amp; linens I've come to expect from the Marriott family were even nicer than usual.However, the king bed in a friend's room wasn't so great - not nearly as comfortable and not up to the Renaissance/Marriott standard. So if you have a choice, go with the queen room.The bathroom was great - Aveda products &amp; good lighting. The TV in the bathroom mirror was amusing, but mostly a gimmick. I like the local art on the walls, the connections to Chicago history, and the selection of books on local lore - the overall attention to detail here is what made my trip so enjoyable. The hotel was completely full, but once in my room, I didn't hear any other guests.Unlike another reviewer, I found the Doormen, Concierge, and desk staff to all be very friendly &amp; helpful. Theo &amp; Jordan couldn't have been nicer or more helpful (thanks Theo, for the directions to Malnati's - you were right, it was that good!). The ever-changing video feed from the roof is fun to watch.Also, late at night the lobby is a very relaxing place to chill with good music and free wifi. This is a fun hotel to explore, and staff doesn't seem to mind you looking around.My only other complaint about my trip is with the City of Chicago - the sales tax is a little steep at 10%, but at $40+/night, the hotel taxes are an insult to visitors. Traffic management was the worst I've seen for a city of any size - but that's nothing to do with the Blackstone. If anything, the Blackstone is a charming, comfortable oasis in the midst of the city, an oasis with good coffee in the lobby and within walking distance to Lou Malnati's pizza &amp; Garrett's Popcorn - what else do you need?"
18,251,"Sep 24 2009 	Just the small things keep this from being a 5-star hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Renaissance Blackstone Fri-Sun of Labor Day weekend for Jazz Fest. We had stayed at the hotel the year before for the same reason, and we will come again. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the location is perfect. Their staff needs to work on a few things to be more attentive to their guests. Our room faced southeast and had a lovely view of the Planetarium, the Oceanarium and the Field Museum. Room was exceptionally quiet despite being on the corner of Michigan and Balbo. Our king bed was clean and the mattress was very comfortable. The suede chaise in the room is just perfect to stretch out on and read or watch television. Mini-bar prices were reasonable, room came with 2 spa robes. There is a Starbucks on the lower level with an outdoor seating area where we went on Sat. It was very pleasant to sit there and people watch and enjoy some coffee. We had breakfast on Sun in Mercat. My only quibble is that they need to increase their staffing for weekend morning breakfast service. There were a number of tables occupied and not enough servers. The hostess was doubling as the bartender. The servers were obviously stretched and were not too prompt with additional things like hot sauce, etc. Prices are on the high side, too. We noticed a number of people being seated, checking out the menu, and then getting up and leaving without eating. If you're on a budget, you might want to just go to the Starbucks for their oatmeal/pastries. Fitness center is clean and has about 10 treadmills, 10 Ellypticals and a free weights room. Towels, fruit, water provided and the door requires a room key card to prevent outsiders from accessing the facilities/security. Doormen should be more prompt to welcome/acknowledge guests. When I arrived alone (my husband was arriving later) I got out of a taxi with my luggage and started up the stairs on Balbo before anyone acknowledged me/welcomed me/offered me assistance. Sat evening, we came out of the hotel to go to dinner and stood and waited while the bellmen/valet/doormen stood around and chatted and never approached us. We finally went to the curb and hailed a cab ourselves and the doorman acted surprised that we had done so on our own. Front desk staff is good; I noticed that the concierge seemed overwhelmed on Sun as people were asking for assistance with site-seeing, wanting to check bags, etc. More attention to staffing on weekends is needed. Overall, they are close to being a 5 star hotel, and much more cozy, accessible and updated than the tired Chicago Hilton &amp; Towers next door, which is enormous, impersonal and much more for conventioneers than for leisure or business travelers."
19,251,Sep 21 2009 	Awesome	We were in town from waukegan for the U2 concert the rooms and service were definitely superior to hotels ive visited in Peoria and the Washington DC areas it was just awesome!!!!!
20,251,"Sep 15 2009 	Totally Disappointed	The reception was terrible, the valet - that's why service is not a part of their title, the bees, not the best addition in a room with an infant. We stayed there almost a week when my wife was at a training at the Hilton. I am a Marriot Rewards member, but surely that did not do much in their eyes. From the start we were treated as though we did not belong there. There was no formal welcome except from the Valet service. We wanted to park ourselves, big mistake. We traveled with an infant and had many things, but the Valet told the bellboy to take our luggage off his cart. The Valet would't even budge to open the door in the absence of a greeter. You have to climb stairs to get to the lobby from the outside. Even with all the luggage that comes with traveling with an infant, the Valet didn't even think to tell us that there was an elevator. We had to discover this on our own. We were in line, but the front desk served someone else better dressed than us first. Then we got the &quot;room with the view&quot; that also came with wasps. We complained to the front desk, but we had to again ask, this time with the housekeeping staff. They caulked up the hole with no guarantees. We asked to be moved and no help was offered in moving the crib and everything else we had to lug ourselves. We talked to the manager and got a plate of stinking cheese. We complained after getting back and got an email for more information. We responded. It is now a month and a half later and yet not a response. We should have stayed at the Hilton across the street. We will use up all points and cut the rewards card. Thanks Blackstone for ruining a good relationship.The best thing about the stay were the nice housekeeping folks. Management could learn alot from them. For those that are wheelchair bound, go somewhere else because you have to open the doors yourself and the elevator is too small."
21,251,"Sep 7 2009 	Blown away by the service and accomodations!	We stayed at the Blackstone in early August to go to the Lollapalooza Music Festival and to visit area colleges. We were really blown away by all aspects of the hotel (except for reservations but I will get to that later). The service in the hotel was really topnotch and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Room service went out of their way to accommodate us, when we arrived after 10 p.m. and required vegan choices for my daughter. The food was excellent in both the Mercat Restaurant and room service (which I often try to avoid). The staff did an incredible job as the hotel was completely booked and it was very hectic for the first three days we were here. Even our housekeeping service was friendly and accommodating. It did appear that everyone that worked here really enjoyed their job and was interested in making sure you were happy. The rooms were very comfortable. Plenty of space and well laid out. The beds were extremely comfortable. The bathrooms were spacious and we loved the walk in shower (no bathtub). We were also surprised that the rooms were pretty quiet. No noise from the street but we could definitely hear the music festival although this didn't bother us as it ended at 10 p.m. every night. The weather was brutally hot - high 90's but our room and the rest of the hotel was always nice and cool.The location is good if you are interested in going to the museums and aquarium as well as spending time in the parks. The restaurants within walking distance were somewhat limited. The one area that we had a problem was with reservations. I requested a double room (two beds) connected to a king room. I was later sent an email letting me know that my request was not available, although I did not realize this at first as I thought it was just a confirmation. Once I realized this, I called the hotel back and was told that I should call two weeks before arrival and was led to believe that this would be possible. I called two weeks out and was told to call back a few days before arrival. When I did this, I was told to call back two days before arrival and when I did this I was told to call the day before and then the day of. During this time, not once was I told that there are very few rooms in the hotel that have doubles (I think it is one per floor) and that the likelihood was not good that one would be available. In addition to that, these are also the only rooms that connect. We ended up with two rooms each with a king that did not connect. This definitely effected our trip as my husband and I each had to share a room and a bed with one of our children. In the end, the accommodations and service made us glad that we stayed here."
22,251,"Sep 7 2009 	In A Word...Spectacular!	My wife and I were celebrating our 22nd Wedding Anniversary and decided on The Blackstone Hotel on Michigan Ave. in Chicago. Before our stay we were contacted via email with a personal note regarding our arrival. This was a very nice touch. I informed them of our anniversary and when we arrived at our room we had been upgraded to a lake view room (the view was spectacular on a beautiful September Chicago day) and we had a bottle of wine and appetizer awaiting us. It was truely a surprise. Molly in the sales department should be commended for taking such good care of us on our special day.The room was very ecclectic and comfortable. I was blown away by how nice the hotel had been redone. It was decorated in dark rich colors and there was attention paid to every detail. The room was spacious, with a king bed, and comfortable. Even though our room lacked a tub, the shower was very nice and the &quot;rainshower&quot; head was out of this world relaxing. Our room overlooked the lake and the city and was the best part of the room. If given the choice in the future I would definately pay extra to upgrade to this type of room again...it was that special. About the only bad thing I can say about the room (1618) was that the noise was a little noticable from the city 16 floors below which was a surprise. We only noticied it in the morning and only when there was an ambulance or morning train whistle. Otherwise we never noticed anything during the night. We requested early chcek in and late check out and it was not a problem and the staff could not have been more accomodating to us. We had drinks at the Mercat Bar and they were fantastic. I really have never felt so &quot;taken care of&quot; while staying at a hotel. Only one person knew it was our anniversary but it seemed as though everyone knew and applied the special touch. Again, The Blacksone Hotel in Chicago is now my favorite &quot;Home away from home&quot; when I visit the city."
23,251,"Aug 27 2009 	The perfect mix of eclectic modern appointment and history	This historic building is absolutely beautiful. Don't let the age put you off -- the rooms have been updated and provide a perfect guest stay. Ours faced Lake Michigan so we could look out over the weekend fireworks at Navy Pier.If you need to be at the Chicago Hilton for an event, skip the Hilton and stay across the street at the Blackstone."
24,251,"Aug 27 2009 	Finishing Touches Show True Quality	My teenage sister and I stayed at The Blackstone during American Idol auditions. It was an incredibly convenient location with in &amp; out parking privileges which allowed us to go back and forth between the auditions with no problem. It was just across the street (a short 2 minute walk) from Lake Michigan. On the interior of the hotel the decor was incredible!!! In the lobby they maintained the historical details of the building. On the interior of the rooms they were amazing. The place has obviously had a complete overhaul from top to bottom and the finishing touches show that whoever did the renovation paid very close attention to detail and used all high-end finishes. Everything in the hotel room was better than we could have asked for from the amazingly fluffy beds and pillows to the fully stocked mini fridge, to the flat screen TV, huge desk and the bathroom. The bathroom was impeccable with marble floors and counter tops. We never heard anything through the walls either. The place is built completely solid. The staff was also incredibly helpful. We had a great experience and would stay here again any day of the week."
25,251,"Aug 21 2009 	Wonderful!	We stayed at the Blackstone for 3 nights in August. Overall, we were pleased with the accomodations. The room was quite spacious, the beds were very comfortable and the staff members were helpful. We picked this hotel because it had been recently renovated and they did a wonderful job with it. It's not too big a hotel either which i think is great when you have kids with you. We had breakfast at the Mercat each morning and it was enjoyable and fairly priced.There is 1 thing I did not like. The day we were leaving (August 7th) was the beginning of La La Palooza. Prior to making my reservation, i phoned the hotel to ask whether or not they could accomodate a late check-out on the 7th. I was told it shouldn't be a problem. The day i checked in (August 4th), i was told the same thing although they told me i should let them know the morning of the 7th. So i did. And the response I got was, &quot;i'm sorry but because of the La La Palooza&quot; taking place this weekend, we are unable to accomodate your reuqest.&quot; Well, it's not like the festival came as a surprise. I would have appreciated it if I had been told of this prior to confirming my reservation. If this is an annual event that sells out their rooms, they could have been honest about it from the get-go and told me so. The location of the Blackstone places it right at the center of the festival - i could have picked a hotel more north of Grant Park to have avoided this. So that actually annoyed me that day. Otherwise, it you are looking for a comfortable, clean and upscale place to stay, the Blackstone would be it."
26,251,"Aug 20 2009 	Best in Chicago	I travel for work (and sometimes leisure) often. I try to stay in a new place each time until I find my favorite hotel in each city. I have to say that the I've stayed in a number of Chicago hotels &amp; I can definitely say that the Blackstone is hands down, my favorite. Here's what I like about the place:*conveniently located*staff is friendly*starbucks connected with hotel*rooms are well designed and very very comfortable (beds)*also conveniently set up for business, internet*and most importantly the hotel just has a pleasant and uplifting energy about it (if you believe in that sort of thing). I just feel happy when I stay here. A good, comfortable atmosphere that's stylish.Cons:*paying for wifiI would definitely recommend."
27,251,"Aug 14 2009 	Fantastic	Great hotel, great staff, great location.Great fitness center. Buy a 3 day transit pass. Well worth it. You can get everywhere by subway or bus from this hotel."
28,251,"Aug 14 2009 	We Loved It	I have to say this is one of the better hotels we have stayed in in awile. I am started to think custoner service and proper cleaning was a thing of the past but the Blackstone met all of my expectations. We reserved a King size room so we had no problem like the previous posters with bed size. The room was very nice. Nice decoration, white duvet cover-not a comforter which skeeves me. The bathroom was very roomy-although it does not have a tub so if you like a tub this is not the place for you. The lighting was also very nice in the room, almost all lights had dimmers. There were also several mirrors so if someone was in the bathroom you could have an alternate place to get ready. I also liked that there were roman shades which blocked out the light at night. Nice soaps etc.We did not know Lollapalooza was going to be going on so when we saw the lobby filled with teenagers and their parents we were a bit worried we would hear noise all night long but we didn't. The workout room was great. It was very large-3 rooms with just about every weight machine any mid-size gym would have, plus free weights. There were also several nice new treadmills, ellipticles, and a couple of bikes. All had TV's attatched to them which was nice.My one recommendation would be that if you do want a pop or water dont get it from the little gift shop in the hotel it costs $3. Go the the CVS around the corner.We would stay here again."
29,251,"Aug 10 2009 	Avoid the Blackstone 1 King/2 Queens ""Bait 	My wife and kids and I had a very disappointing experience at the Blackstone this past weekend. I had booked two rooms for two nights at the Blackstone 6 months ago for Lollapalooza this year, and it turned out to be a very poor choice. When I had tried to book the rooms on the Blackstone's website, it would only let me book rooms described as &quot;1 King or 2 Queen.&quot; Because my wife and I were traveling with four teenagers, I called the Blackstone's reservation number to make the reservation instead of doing it on-line so that I could confirm that I would be able to get 2 rooms with 2 beds in each room. Given that I was booking the rooms so early, I was assured by the person taking the reservation that this wouldn't be a problem. However, when we got to the hotel, we were told that there were no &quot;double queen&quot; bed rooms available. Obviously, we wouldn't have booked the Blackstone hotel if I had known this would be the case, and we weren't alone in this experience. The couple checking in next to us was told the same thing and had the same problem. The Blackstone clearly knows how many King bedrooms and double Queen bedrooms that it has when it takes reservations. This &quot;1 King or 2 Queen beds&quot; option was simply a &quot;bait and switch&quot; scam by the Blackstone. Don't be fooled by this like we were. To make matters worse, from the time we checked in, it took 3 calls and 6 hours for the hotel to bring up 2 roll-away beds. And then to cap off our less-than-stellar Blackstone experience, there was urine still in the toilet in one of the rooms that we checked into on Friday. While this didn't ruin our experience, it certainly wasn't pleasant.The Blackstone is a very nicely decorated hotel, and the rooms are very comfortable. From the stand point of the rooms, they were fine. However, at this point, I can't imagine recommending the Blackstone to anyone staying in Chicago. If you want to experience downtown Chicago, stay at the Affinia. My wife and I have stayed there several times, and it is excellent. And if you're coming down to Lollapalooza next year, I'd suggest staying at the Hilton or perhaps even the Travelodge. They are both just as close to Grant Park, and if you make a reservation, you will know what you're getting."
30,251,"Aug 5 2009 	It's all in the details	We stayed at the Blackstone over Memorial Day weekend and it was a really perfect stay. Beautiful property in a great location. The bathroom was gorgeous and the bed super comfy. The room was compact but had just about everything you'd need, though no mini-fridge. The biggest con is the exhorbitant parking rate, but I s'pose that's to be expected in what can be an expensive city to visit. However, I would suggest checking out one of the numerous lots/garages in the vicinity. The hotel charges $47 per night for valet. That rate is also very similar to the garage rate just across the street at the Hilton, which I believe is where The Blackstone valets park guest vehicles. Not sure if there are in-and-out privileges included, but we found a nice, new-ish, secure garage at the corner of 8th and State. Just a block away from the hotel. It's in the same building as the Lou Malnatti's restaurant and the entry is on 8th Street, between Wabash and State. The overnight rate was from $17-20. Can't recall the name of the garage, but there is a digital sign affixed to the outside of the building above the entry that says 24 hour parking. There were two or three open-air street-level parking lots, but the garage worked really well for our stay. Hope this little parking tutorial helps."
31,251,"Jul 19 2009 	Superb in every way!	The Blackstone has to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at, period, end of story. From the extremely comfortable feather beds, to excellent customer service, to turn down service with chocolates, no detail is overlooked at the Blackstone. The staff is very friendly and helpful; the hotel is as clean as any hotel I have ever stayed in. The fitness center is also excellent; it has tall windows with panoramic views as far as Lake Michigan and fresh fruit available for the end of your workout. The compliments could just go on and on, but simply put, stay at the Blackstone and you will not be disappointed!"
32,251,"Jul 5 2009 	Exceptional service. Excellent Property. Fabulous views of the lake and park	Hotel staff went out of thier way to take care of our room no matter what the request.Maids were excellent. Houskeeping very well organized. Check in was fast. Sodasavailable in lobby for purchase. Valet Parking is expensive, but there are much cheaperlots all around the hotel.I usually see lots of things that need to be fixed or improved. I did not see one thing that needed fixing or improving.I would recommend hotel to everyone.Note: There is not a pool, but there is an excercise room."
33,251,"Jul 2 2009 	Loved it!	I stayed at the Blackstone for two nights while attending a conference at the mammoth Hilton next door. The Blackstone is a lovely hotel - a much nicer place to stay than the impersonal, rather tired Hilton. The welcoming, helpful staff really set the Blackstone apart. From the bell staff who rush to help you with your bags or hail you a taxi, to the housekeeping staff who keep the rooms spic and span, they all did a first-rate job. It's definitely worth reserving a lakeview room; mine was on the 18th room, and the views were spectacular - Lake Michigan with all its sailboats, Grant Park, and a view of the city from Navy Pier to the north all the way down to the Museum Campus and Soldier Field in the south. The room decor was funky modern; the bed was supremely comfortable; and everything worked well, including the flat-screen HDTV with lots of channels. The bathroom was spic and span; lots of fluffy towels were provided, as well as bathrobes. No bathtub, but an excellent, spacious shower. As other reviewers have pointed out, the frosted-glass sliding bathroom door is a problem for those who are sharing a room and want some privacy. As I was staying by myself, it wasn't an issue.The only slight drawback was that the hotel's excellent tapas restaurant, Mercat a la Planxa, was closed for renovations during my stay - would have loved to try it. But it was fun to be right across the street from the Taste of Chicago event.I felt so comfortable and pampered that it was hard to leave my room to attend my conference. Would love to stay here again on my next visit!"
34,251,"Jul 2 2009 	This is a great hotel!	I was in Chicago for business for three days and really enjoyed staying at the Blackstone. Everything was customer service related: check-in smooth and efficient, all questions answered very promptly, gave a late check-out to 1 p.m. It was a busy time in the city (Taste of Chiacgo right across the street), but the hotel was calm and quiet. I nenver heard noise of other guests, which is something that really bugs me in many hotels. The restaurant is closed for 10 days while re-tiling, but the great food is available from room service. We had a drink there the night before closing and the ambience was very nice although a bit noisy. The room had a little view of the lake from a comfortablle chair. Great lighting for reading in bed, and a very comfortable bed. Aveda shampoo etc, my favorite brand. Really can't say enough about this great stay, and it was very reasonable for the summer."
35,251,"Jul 1 2009 	Excellent Choice!	My stay was excellent. Upon entering, someone immediately asked to assist with my luggage and another graciously parked the car. Hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful. The room was a bit on the small side, but very elegant. The only downfall is the bathroom door. Even when closed, you can still see inside. If you are with a group or having visitors and do not want to use the bathroom inside the room because of the door, I know that there is a womans bathroom located on the 6th floor (not sure about one for men). It is also across the street from Grant Park and one black away from where the trolley tours make a stop (at Hilton)."
36,251,"Jun 29 2009 	Absolutely the Best Hotel in Chicago with the Nicest Staff	We were in Chicago for my teenager to check out Columbia College. The Blackstone looked like the closest hotel and I noticed that it had recently been renovated. It was beautiful! The room was large, the beds were so comfy and the staff were happy to help with anything we asked of them. Room service cuts off at 10 though...so order early or take a walk to a nearby restaurant. The location is superb. It's right across from Grant Park and about a 10 minute (slow walker) walk to Millenium Park."
37,251,"Jun 17 2009 	Great area of town nice historic hotel	We pulled up and they were on us like flys at a picnic, one was helping with the luggage, the other was parking the truck. We stayed two nights, paid $125 on priceline, which I thought was a good price. Asked several times during our stay for local information and the staff was very friendly and knew exactly where we needed to go based on our description of what we were looking for. This is within walking distance of several great Chicago landmarks. Upon check in, I asked for a city view, which they graciously granted! This is a great property. Room was recently updated, not the biggest room, but plenty of room for my wife and I. We didn't eat in the hotel, but the restaurant was packed most of the time we were there. Very classy place."
38,251,"Jun 16 2009	Beautiful hotel ok location personable but unknowledgable staff.	My daughter and I went for a 3 day weekend for a wedding. We arrived on Friday afternoon. We felt welcome from the moment we arrived. We were greeted by friendly doormen who opened the cab door for us and took our luggage inside. We checked in, went to our room which was on the 7th floor. Snacks and drinks were provided for an extra charge, which we did not use. I noticed coffee and tea but found it strange that sweetner and creamer were not provided. We loved the actual room. Nice big bed, great desk and chair, but I can honestly say the bathroom design/layout was lousy. It reminded me of the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Must be the same architect. You absolutely have no privacy with these bathrooms. Everything is all in one room. The bathroom door just slides over the opening, doesn't shut. Therefore, anybody sitting in the bedroom area can hear everything that is going on in the bathroom. You might as well leave the door open. There was no purpose in it at all. Very odd. The shower was nice and big, but again, no door which is ok except water gets everywhere on the floor. I think the toilet should always be separate from the rest of the bathroom. Never can 2 people get ready at the same time. Would be embarassing if you had a guest visiting with you in your room and then someone used the bathroom. You would hear it all. Poor design, Blackstone. My daughter and I would joke about it and whoever needed to use the bathroom, then the other would wait on the bed and had to turn the TV on to make some distraction noise!!! We were happily surprised by the Blues Fest we came across at Grant Park which was across the street. Location was fine, but noisy for sure. The staff was friendly but not well informed as they should be about directions and restaurants. We asked where we should go for famous Chicago pizza and we were given directions and never found the place. This happened 3 different times. I asked about Italian Beef sandwiches and nobody had a clue as to where to get those (Chicago is famous for them) and on my last day walking around, there was a restaurant within one block of the hotel that had them. I would think they would know this. They told us how to take the bus which was $2.25/each person but did not inform us that for only $5.75 you could purchase a day pass and ride all you wanted to. We learned this the last day as well and wasted money because we were not informed of this. It's a college area and safe and fun. But next time, I would stay some place else closer to the shops and I would make sure the bathrooms were a bit more private. Just my thing, I guess!"
39,251,Jun 15 2009 	Nice hotel	The hotel was really nice. My room was decorated really nicely. The bed was comfortable. Nice toiletries. The location was great. Easy walk to restaurants and the museum area. The staff was very friendly. The room service was over priced but otherwise I really liked this hotel.
40,251,"Jun 15 2009 	Very nice but a little lacking	This is a charming property with an interesting juxtaposition of modern decorating on a historic foundation. We were delighted to hear a little of the hotel history while on our Gray Line bus tour of the city. I booked this hotel for $115 on Priceline--surely a good deal--but was disappointed to get short shrift on service. It is not the first time that I felt I have gotten second-citizen treatment when dealing with a Priceline reservation. I called four times in the course of two weeks, six weeks in advance of the trip, to request a room with two beds; only on the fourth call did someone actually put my request in the system. Upon early check-in, however, I was given only a king room with the promise of a rollaway. Come our return to the room at 11:30 pm, no rollaway had been added to the room. Upon visiting the front desk, I was told that a rollaway would not fit in the room because of fire codes, that there were no rollaways left, and that there were no other rooms available. Finally, I was given the use of a &quot;parlor room&quot;--essentially a meeting room on another floor that had a fold-out couch. I was happy for some accomodation after the broken promise but overall disappointed that we could not have gotten a two-bed room to begin with. The hotel was clean and the rooms were comfortable. The maid service was only fair, despite good tipping; the half-empty toiletries were not replenished after the first night. At checkout my room was given someone else's mini-bar charges, an error that was corrected with a phone call. Overall, this is a hotel with great character that could use a little improvement on the personnel front."
41,251,"Jun 15 2009 	Are you kidding me?	When we arrived at the hotel at 11:30pm, the front desk staff informed us that our room was no longer available (we had confirmed our reservation earlier in the day and made &amp; paid for the reservation 3 months ago). The customer service was much below the standards of a hotel that is affiliated with Marriott which follows the values of &quot;Do Whatever it Takes to Take Care of the Customer&quot; We were told that the Blackstone would accommodate us at another hotel, however this hotel would be near OHare airport. We live about 45 miles south of Chicago so this would have made no sense. Our night was ruined on the account of Blackstone Hotel. We were planning on spending the weekend in Chicago and this could no longer happen. The manager said we would be reimbursed for our room and we were given money for a cab ride home. The staff did not seem a bit apologetic for their mistakes. I was so angry, and I couldnt believe when a security guard came to me and said he would escort me out if I didnt calm down!! Didnt I have every right to be angry!? UNBELIEVABLE!"
42,251,"Jun 7 2009 	Re-born but not yet mature!	The good bits first - friendly check-in staff, modern rooms with a boutique hotel feel, superbly comfortable bed, shower (no bath), small rooms (even though we apparently had a slightly larger one). To be honest ,taken at face value this hotel is fine - the problems occur when you scratch the surface. It's apparently a 4 star hotel (sadly the girl on reception didn't know this). We requested and paid for a lake-view room and sure enough our room faced the lake but - when the room was re-designed the TV was put bang slap in the middle of the window - completely obscuring the wonderful view - even the staff were bemused by this and no, neither the desk nor TV could be moved - both firmly screwed down. Apparently some rooms have TV's on the wall - well I never! There were none of the things you would expect to find in a 4 star hotel - no one offered to help with our bags (saved on the tip I guess), no writing paper or sewing kit, cheap toiletries (thankfully we had our own). I believe this is a Marriott - it certainly feels like a fairly typical US Marriott albeit wearing a nice frock. There is a very small rather dingy bar which smelled rather damp and a Tapas bar with an award winning chef but sadly it just didn't seem appetising (fortunately Chicago is awash with great eateries).So with no view to admire we decided to indulge in a cup of coffee in the bar - oh no we couldn't: not in the bar, not even in the lobby even though it was only 5pm on a Saturday. The on-sight Starbucks - allegedly open till 8pm closes at 5pm (staff know this but haven't changed room info). We were told we could only have coffee via room service or The Hilton opposite - and you know what - if you're planning on a trip to Chicago we suggest that's where you go - we could have got a better rate for Hilton - we will go back to Chicago it's a truly amazing city, but not to Blackstone there are simply too many better hotels for the same or less dosh."
43,251,"May 27 2009 	Great hotel but...	We stayed at the Blackstone over Memorial Day weekend. Paid $99 a night through a Travelzoo promotion. Without a doubt, one of the great bargains in Chicago. While the hotel itself was 5 star, the maid service was 1 star. In spite of generous tips each morning, the only sign a maid had been in the room was a made bed and clean towels. Everything else was basically the same. We even called for a re-clean one night while we were out for dinner and the only thing we noticed was the radio on playing soothing music and chocolates on our bed. The floor still had not been vacuumed. Had we been paying nearly $180 a night, like our friends, I would have been very disappointed in the experience, but at $99 even with marginal cleaning, the Blackstone is a great deal."
44,251,"May 26 2009 	Pleasant Annversary	I booked this room for $99 through expedia.com. I think by far the best deal I have ever gotten on a hotel. This is a very nice and elegant hotel with a great decor. We stayed night in the city for our anniversary and had a pleasant evening. We were not there very long, and did not require any service from the hotel, so that is something I can not comment to much on. The hotel has a very good location next to Grant Park, we took a nice evening stroll and heard part of a jazz concert. It has an excellent tapas restaurant. 2 things people may want to know in advance are that on each floor the of the 10 or so rooms 4 rooms face the lake/park. The other thing is the bathroom is basically open to the rest of the room. There is a frosted glass door that slides shut to partially obscures the view. This is fine if you are with your spouse or alone, but may not be what you want to share with your children. There is no shower door in the bathroom, so turn up the heat while taking a shower.I would greatly recommend this hotel, but would just advise you know what you are getting."
45,251,"May 18 2009 	Beautiful Classic Historic Perfect!	My wife and I stayed for a nice weekend the first part of May. We had booked at Marriott.com and saved nearly $50 by paying in advance. The hotel was in an excellent location, just four blocks away from the Orange and Red line station. Our room looked over Michigan Avenue and had a terrific view of Buckingham Fountain and Lake Michigan. Buddy Guy's Legends is a quick 5 minute walk and it is very easy to walk to such sights as the Sears Tower, musuem, Soldier Field and other sights.There were only three 'negative' that I can think of. The bathroom door is just a slider and doesn't provide the ideal amount of privacy....not a big deal but I can see how some people would be bothered by that. Parking was the other issue. As in most of downtown Chicago, parking is expensive and it was $47/day for parking with in and out privileges. We got lucky however and found parking in an open lot one block west of the hotel. $13/day but it was an unsecured lot. We had a rental car so were not too concerned but in inclement weather or having a higher end vehicle, you may want to consider the parking on site. The hotel did have a free 'business center' which is great but it only has two computers and during our stay, the printers were not working."
46,251,"May 17 2009 	Absolutely first rate	This hotel is classy, luxurious and modern chic all in one. I loved it. The rooms are fairly spacious and the bathrooms are quite large (although not really &quot;private&quot;). Showers are totally open and the bathroom door was more of mini-blind. The amenities are nice, but not over the top. Its a bit farther from the action of the River North or Magnificent Mile than I would prefer, but it was close to the conventions at McCormick Place. In terms of hotels in Chicago, this one has been the best.I was hosting a morning breakfast at the hotel early in the morning and had a bit of crisis the night before. The staff stayed late (until almost 11:30pm) to accomodate my last minute changes to the meeting plan.More on my time in Chicago:http://justanothertravelblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/chicago-illinois.html"
47,251,"May 14 2009 	Great Physical Plant Staff Needs Help	We love Renaissance hotels, but had some serious service issues at the Blackstone. Here is a part of the letter we sent them describing the problems we encountered.Although our flight was delayed in San Francisco, I phoned the Blackstone from the tarmac @ SFO and advised the front desk that we would be arriving on the date reserved, but without the early check-in as previously arranged months ago.They said that would be fine. When our plane touched down @ O'Hare, I called the Blackstone and was put on hold. My call was not picked up, so I called again from the taxi en route to the Blackstone to be told our room had been sold and there was no room of any kind available in the hotel. I requested assisted in seeking a room at a comparable hotel and was told by the front desk manager that this was not possible.Our reservation had been made (as I mentioned) months earlier and comfirmed prior to our departure from San Francisco, We were instructed by the front desk manager to proceed to the downtown Marriott (not the same hotel class as the Renaissance), where a room would be waiting for us...when we arrived at the Marriott, they had never heard of us and weren't very friendly about it. Finally, after much ado, they gave us a room. We were told by the Blackstone that a room would be ready for us at the Blackstone the next morning....it wasn't. After the Marriott staff came to our door and told us we had exceeded check-out time, we took a taxi to the Blackstone (never reimbursed by the Blackstone). They held our lugggage, and we went out to kill time,...... when we returned, a room was finally available. We were told we were given an upgrade. (I don't think it was an upgrade, as the room had no bath tub and looked like the picture of the one we had reserved months ago). When I called after seeing there was no bath tub, we were told no room with a lake view and two beds (and a bathtub), existed in the entire hotel.....it's a 300+ room hotel.There were problems with getting the room cleaned in a timely manner, at one point, I found myself carrying out room service trays (you will find room service to be slow) and trying to straighten out the room before my husband got back from his business meeting in the late afternoon....something I have never had to do previously, regardless of hotel class.We are not demanding people, but in my opinion, we were rather badly and patronizingly handled by hotel staff. I was a little fearful that issues like this might occur when I saw on tripadvisor that someone else had to find their own parking at the Hilton without much help from Blackstone staff shortly after grand opening following the renovation.We have stayed at the Renaissance Chancery Court in London and have always had a flawless stay there, which is why we selected the Blackston when we were on business in Chicago."
48,251,May 8 2009 	Very Posh - just a little noisy.	Not your average hotel. This is probably the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Would definitely recommend for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Chicago. The fitness center had the newest and best equipment: tv screens with ipod ports on every treadmill/elliptical.
49,251,"May 6 2009 	Very nice downtown Chicago hotel	We stayed for one night (a Sunday night) at the Blackstone during a May, 2009 trip to Chicago. Upon arrival, we learned that the valet parking service at the Blackstone is slightly more expensive than the self-parking at the Hilton parking garage across the street - which was still pricey but not as bad.We found the staff at the Blackstone to be friendly and helpful. Our room (a basic king bed room) was very nice, clean, and comfortable. One of the lights over the bed did not work, but we didn't report it. The bathroom is really nice (marble and such) but we weren't too impressed with the modern shower head - just not enough water pressure for our liking, I guess. The towels and bed linens were all top notch.For wireless internet users, it's going to cost you $14.95 per day to use it in your room, however in the lobby area it is free. We just took our laptop down to the Starbucks that is attached to the lobby and used it there with no problem.Checkout went smoothly and there was no problem with storing our bags for the day while we shopped downtown before heading home.We got an amazing rate on our room so I was MORE than happy to be staying at the Blackstone, however, when I looked up what the normal rates are, I have to say that I don't think I would pay THAT much to stay there. But it was very nice and no major problems to report."
50,251,"May 5 2009 	Great hotel in an ideal location	After reading all of the great reviews, my wife and I decided to stay at the Blackstone. As one would expect from a Renaissance property, the hotel is well-appointed and has a very friendly and service-oriented staff. The location is one of the best features of the hotel. Located right next to beautiful Grant Park and Lake Michigan, it is an ideal place to go for a stroll. Located as it is a little south of the prime shopping district, the hotel is away from a lot of the hustle and bustle while still located in a fantastic area convenient to many attractions and sights.As for the hotel itself, the lobby is beautifully decorated. Also, the fitness center is simply the best I've ever seen at a hotel and includes many state-of-the-art cardiovasular machines. The rooms are likewise very nice. Though the historic nature of the property is evident -- some worn areas on the wallpaper and molding, etc. -- every effort has been made to create tasteful and luxurious rooms. There was a high-definition flat screen TV, a very comfortable bed, and some nice touches including some books about Chicago. The only issue we had was with the bathrooms. Maybe it's picky, but the door to the bathroom is a sliding door and doesn't slide all the way closed. Also, the shower didn't have a door that closed all the way -- causing water to spill onto the bathroom floor.Overall, though, this is a great hotel that is convenient to a lot of attractions in Chicago. Hint: request a lakeview room."
51,251,"Apr 23 2009 	Beautiful but small	I booked a special &quot;anniversary rate&quot; on the club level of the restored Blackstone Renaissance Hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday. The information given me by reservations was incorrect, especially about the club level details (complimentary cocktails - NOT) and I specifically requested to know the size of the room, and was quoted 390 sqft. Upon checking in, we were given a corner lake view room as requested on the club level. We we arrived at the room, about 1/3 of the square footage was a long hallway. The decor resembles a W rather than a Renaissance, but it was new, beautiful and clean. There was a very comfortable king sized bed, and a desk under the flat screen TV. There was a chair stuck in next to the desk, but there was no place to read or watch the TV other than the bed. We were there to enjoy our stay at the hotel, and since it was raining and we live in Chicago, we were there more for the hotel than the sights. It was very disappointing. Another non view room had been prepared for us with our Marriott preferences, and when the desk clerk changed the room to the requested lake view, he set someone up with the additional pillows. Someone from housekeeping arrived with a refrigerator (no room for that - we sent it away!) and one king sized pillow in a dirty standard pillowcase. I called the front desk to ask for the rest of our down pillows, and the housekeeping manager showed up and said that the king sized pillow wasn't even from their hotel - Very Strange!!  When speaking to the front desk about a room change, we were informed that the historic landmarking prevented changes on the inside of the hotel, and they were not even allowed to put in a pool. So, although it is a beautiful restoration, we felt there was more room in the rain showered bath than the room itself. Needless to say, we checked out a day early."
52,251,"Apr 18 2009 	Lakeview rooms are fantastic!	I surprised my (stressed) hubby with a trip to Chicago and we stayed at the Blackstone. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised when we walked into the hotel... and then our room. Fantastic hotel, very clean, great location (convenient to many attractions), great price! We will definitely be staying there on future visits."
53,251,"Apr 14 2009 	Great hotel but bathroom is not private!	No complaints, except for the bathroom door in our hotel room. It is a sliding door, and when the door is &quot;closed&quot;, you can still see in through the sides of the door - really bizarre; great for voyeurs. I don't know who designed this door, but they weren't thinking of the guests' privacy."
54,251,"Apr 13 2009 	Great hotel great service	My 17 year old daughter and I stayed at the hotel for two nights as we searched for colleges for her. The Blackstone is great. The location on Michigan Ave. is close to Grant Park, it is only a couple of blocks from the El, and if you are a walker, you can walk to many locations. The staff was always friendly and helpful, especially the bellmen. The rooms are modern and unique--they don't look like typical hotel rooms. The beds are comfy, the TV is great. Having a Starbucks in the building makes for a quick breakfast if needed. All in all, a great stay."
55,251,"Apr 12 2009 	If I could live at The Blackstone I would!!!	WOW!!! What a GREAT find! I just returned from a wonderful trip to Chicago and staying at The Blackstone was definitely a highlight! From the moment we arrived we received nothing but top of the line service.....every person on the staff was over the top friendly, courteous and helpful. The rooms were SPACIOUS and GORGEOUS. Obviously recently updated, our room had a marble entry and bathroom, the beds had down comforters, a plasma TV on the wall, and plenty of room to spread out! It was quiet and very clean. There is a nice business center with two computers with free internet access and printers (this was great to research directions or restaurants). It is directly across the street from Grant Park and there are a few eateries within a few blocks. One night we came back to the hotel late (around 11pm or so) and wanted to order pizza.....the woman at the front desk provided us with three different brochures of nearby places that deliver! Our midnight snack was delicious! As far as getting around, the subway is about 2 blocks away, however we found that the buses were super convenient and easy to use.....or, we walked! We were two single gals traveling together and we never felt unsafe anywhere around the hotel (or, anywhere in Chicago). We paid $99/night in mid-April for two queen beds.....what a steal! I even booked on the Marriott website so I didn't have to pre-pay and could cancel up until 4pm on our arrival date if needs be. Luckily that wasn't the case! We were told by a local that this hotel used to fall into the &quot;seedy&quot; category, however it was recently purchased by Marriott and they are trying to turn around it's previous reputation. So far, I believe they are doing a FABULOUS job!!! I would HIGHLY recommend this property to anyone staying in Chicago.....a great hotel and great location!"
56,251,"Mar 29 2009 	A hotel to make you smile	My husband and I traveled to the Blackstone during the week while he attended a show at the conference center. What an amazing experience it was at the Blackstone. From the moment we arrived, the valet and bellboy staff were so friendly....to the check-in desk (who certainly had their hands full with so many people checking in at one time). They were extremely efficient to get us in quickly! The lobby had such a unique vibe to it that carried throughout the hotel....upscale, classy, yet in a truly funky way! Our room was really nice....not a terrific view, but that wasn't a concern. The room we had was pretty narrow, but long. The room was furnished in highly contemporary and modern furnishings. The bed was amazingly comfortable! I loved the books that they had on the bookshelves to read while I was there. The bathroom was pretty unique with a shower stall which was just a clear glass wall. The best part of the hotel was the elevators....one thing I'll never forget. You couldn't help but smile in the morning when you went in them with not your typical elevator music....rather, upbeat dance music! We'll definitely stay here again! Great location, too, within walking distance of an incredible breakfast place (Yolk) and a corner cafe/deli."
57,251,"Mar 26 2009 	Great stay	Was staying in town for business and attending a convention at McCormick. This hotel was a 7 minute bus ride (bus provided by the convention which stopped at the Hilton located next door). The staff was very helpful, rooms were spacious and clean with a contempory feel. Had a wonderful view of the lake."
58,251,"Mar 26 2009	Interesting historic hotel with a funky modern update	This is a great hotel if you don't want to be right in the middle of shopping and would rather be closer to museums, universities, etc. Do ask for a room with a view and you will wake up to Grant Park and Lake Michigan. Everything about this hotel is unique (including the metallic gold tufted couches in the lobby). The rooms are very modern and have tremendous bathrooms. There's a Starbuck's in the lobby and a great tapas restaurant. Parking was expensive, but it's expensive everywhere in downtown Chicago. My daughter and I walked to shopping and restaurants and saw the Chicago River turn green. It was a great place."
59,251,"Mar 21 2009 	Every staff member made you feel welcome	I went to the AORN Congress this last week and stayed at the Blackstone. I purchased my room through Priceline so I feel the value was exceptional. The room was beautiful with a nice bathroom and rainfall shower. The service is what puts this hotel above many others. The staff was fantastic. I was made to feel welcome and valued as a customer. The location is great with most attractions within a $7 cab ride or within walking distance. Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum, the planetarium, Navy Pier, and the Magnificent Mile. The food at the Blackstone was good if not a little expensive. I paid $16 for a sandwich via room service but what I got was so big it was lunch and dinner. I highly recommend the Blackstone when staying in Chicago, I know I will go back."
60,251,"Mar 19 2009 	Awesome historical hotel with a modern twist...	This hotel was amazing. The location is right on Michigan Ave (on one end) so you can walk all along it for great restaurants, shopping and sightseeing. In terms of the hotel itself, the decor is very trendy, while still maintaining its historical facade. Everything seemed very new and well maintained. The room (king size) was nicely composed, flat screen HD, comfy chairs and shower but no bath.The best part for me was the free internet in the business center, I also liked the witty 'do not disturb' signs that read instead &quot;Please Go Away - I am debating with JFK&quot;Overall a very pleasant stay, great location, great hotel and at a decent price!"
61,251,"Mar 19 2009 	Very nice place and a great value.	A nicely refurbished classic old hotel with elegant public areas and modern, comfortable, spacious, well-supplied, and well-operating rooms. Friendly staff in the lobby. Just three blocks to the Art Institute and a few more blocks to State Street shopping and some of the business centers. All in all a very pleasant place and a great value (though the tapas restaurant inside was overcrowded and overpriced). Highly recommended."
62,251,"Mar 18 2009 	Some of the staff was nicer than the others	I've noticed that I'm big on service. So when I check-in, I want good service. Someone to welcome you after a long journey, and give you a decent room upon arrival. I was quite unimpressed with this gentleman's service. We arrived around 3pm (check-in time, per their terms) to find that there were no double queen rooms remaining. Now, I know that when you book via their site, you merely make certain requests and they do their best to accommodate you. But when you check-in on time (neither early or late), and they give you a room on the lowest floor (7th, right above the gym) when you requested high floors and a king bed when you requested two queens.. would you be impressed? All the while emphasizing that we got a $99 rate (as if they could get more in this economy), which is why we could not guarantee the double queens. I just feel that you should charge what you think you deserve for your hotel. For example, if you think you are better than $99, and do not need the boost in traffic from people you consider less than your ideal clientele, then feel free to do so. That way you weed out those you find less than worthy, and you can charge the $400/night you believe your hotel is worth. I just ask you this -- how do you fit 3 people onto one king bed? The 3 people we stated upon reservation, I might add. Anyhow, he did not make a very good effort to make us happy... The next morning, the lady was also unpleasant when I asked to change rooms (since the guy at check-in had said it would not be a problem).. but again, I had difficulty communicating with her (Diana?). I'm not sure what their problem is. But luckily, we were not in the room too much and I finally got over the room situation. Other than that, the staff was really nice. I particularly liked the doormen and the rest of the concierge/front desk was pleasant. They were helpful with restaurant recommendations and transportation options. The room itself was pretty nice. You can tell that it has been recently renovated, with comfortable bed and LG flat screen. The bathroom was fairly spacious, but I will say that you should probably share a room with close family &amp; friends, because the way the sliding door closes leaves little to the imagination. The shower did not really have a door, and was all glass..so again, little to the imagination. This is just in our room - I am certain that there are better rooms. The business center was great.. two computers hooked up with all the internet you will need, and printers as well. This is one of the best features of the hotel, given that they do not provide free wireless.Other fine qualities include the proximity to Grant Park (though if you try to walk to certain attractions such as the Sears Tower or John Hancock, it will be quite a trek). Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago are within walking distance. One downside is the lack of restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel (starbucks closes at 8) so you should probably eat before you go back to the hotel, although room service was not too bad. The selection was decent, and the people were nice :) Other than that, you have to walk to State Street (under the El, and the street not particularly well lit) to feed yourself, particularly later at night.All in all, it was a great value for our money, despite the less than helpful guy at check-in (though we did not encounter him again). I would probably not go back because it's a bit further south than I would have liked, but definitely a beautiful hotel with nice rooms on the museum campus. Would recommend at the rate we got, but I am not sure how much I more I would pay (though you probably get better service with a higher rate)."
63,251,"Mar 15 2009 	A real gem!	My family of four stayed here for a long weekend in Chicago. We all absolutely loved the Blackstone. The room was very contemporary, while the public areas of the hotel maintained the building's historic charm. The bathroom was large, the shower more than adequate, and the entire room very clean (and I am a very picky traveler when it comes to cleanliness). The location, while a little away from the excitement of most attractions, was right on the bus line and directly across from Grant Park. It was very easy to zip across the street each morning and catch the bus. The staff was accomodating, and I don't think I've ever encountered bell hops who were more pleasant and helpful. This hotel is a definite keeper, and one that you don't want to miss if you're visiting Chicago."
64,251,"Mar 11 2009 	First time in Chicago. Terrific hotel.	I stayed two nights at the Blackstone and really enjoyed it. Check-in with Brett was very welcoming. So glad I booked a lake/park view room - $119/nt. Loved the decor/furnishings. Found it spacious. Did not dine at the hotel, but got coffee at the Starbucks which closes earlier than usual. (7/8pm, I think.) Convenient location. The Michigan Ave public bus stops are one block north and one block south. Quirks:-- The mattress (pillow-top) was a little too soft for my liking.-- The noise of my neighbors' doors clicking/slamming shut was startling."
65,251,"Mar 11 2009 	Terrific hotel location staff--wonderful choice	Although we only stayed at the Blackstone for one night, we enjoyed our stay enough to say that we will definitely be back. Our room was very roomy, the beds were so comfortable, and the bathroom was very upscale with the latest features and terrific bath products. The hotel is located on south Michigan Avenue, right next door to the Chicago Hilton and Towers. This is an excellent location for anyone visiting the museum campus (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium). It's near Grant Park and Millennium Park, so it's a good location for anyone visiting any of the large festivals, such as Taste of Chicago, Jazz Fest, Gospel Fest, etc. It's just down the street from the Art Institute of Chicago. Another five star feature of this hotel is their staff--very warm and friendly and courteous. My boyfriend and I decided to walk around the hotel and look at some of its features, like the Art Hall and the ballroom. We found the door to the ballroom locked, but an employee of the hotel was getting off the elevator and saw us trying the door to the ballroom. He asked us if we would like to go in, so he unlocked the door for us, and gave us some time to look at the beautiful room, and told us a little bit about the renovation of the hotel. When we walked back to the lobby, an employee named Arturo asked if we were enjoying our stay. We told him that we had just been walking around, looking at different places in the hotel. He asked us if we had seen the historic Smoke Filled Suite. We said, &quot;no&quot;, so he offered to take us up there to show it to us. The Smoke Filled Suite is a beautiful suite that has been redecorated to look pretty much like it did in the 1920's. Back in 1920, when members of the Republic party were trying to decide on their presidential candidate, they met in this suite. When they made their decision then opened the door to the waiting press outside, the press was enveloped in a cloud of smoke that came out of the suite. Thus, the phrase &quot;smoked filled room&quot; was adopted. This is a beautiful, comfortable hotel with many interesting historical features, and it comes highly recommended from this reviewer."
66,251,"Mar 10 2009 	First Rate Hotel in a Great Location	Our four night stay at The Blackstone was first rate in every respect. Our room was ready for early check in on arrival. This heritage building has been beautifully restored. Our lakeview room was spacious and comfortable with modern decor. Great beds and bathroom (shower only). Spotlessly clean, as were the hallways and entrance lobby. Friendly, helpful staff. Excellent location close to the Art Institute and Symphony. An easy walk to the Chicago Architectural Foundation store where bus tours of the city's architectural heritage are available. Glad we elected to spend the little extra for a lakeview room. The view from the 12th floor over Grant Park to the lake was lovely at sunrise and through the evening. We tried the restaurant for lunch and enjoyed our meal."
67,251,"Mar 9 2009 	Enjoyed our stay!	My husband and I stayed at The Blackstone from Feb 21-Feb 23. We were celebrating his 30th birthday. We got a great deal through Sam's Club Travel for about $100/night.We chose this hotel for the value and it's proximity to they typical tourists spots. It was close to the Harrison St subway stop. It is directly across the street from Grant Park. We were able to walk to Millennium Park, Art Institute and the Magnificent Mile. We could see Shedd Aquarium and Soldier Field from our window.The pictures shown on the website are exactly what you will see when at the hotel. Our room was very clean and comfortable...especially the bed. There were down pillows and comforters which made it very cozy after a day of sightseeing in the windy city. There was also an ipod dock with several adapters so we could play our own music in the room. The bathroom had funky black and white wallpaper and was accented with pops of red. There was everything you needed....boot buffer, small sewing kit, mouthwash, cotton balls/swabs, etc. There were snacks and beverages available for purchase. I would suggest getting these elsewhere. The prices were outrageous. A small can of nuts for $12!!!Can't really comment on the staff. We didn't really need much of their help except when checking in/out. They did hold our luggage after we checked out at no charge.We enjoyed our stay here and hope to visit in the spring or summer."
68,251,"Mar 9 2009 	Too expensive for the services	PRO: nice room, nice view (pay extra or get brick wall view),nice beds.CONS: have to pay for things that low end hotels/motels like the SUPER 8 give away free - such as $12.99 for wi-fi,$2.50 for local calls,$47.00 per nite for parking, expensive breakfast. I'll stay at a lower end hotel/motel next time."
69,251,"Mar 6 2009 	Fabulous!!! Great attentive front desk.	From the moment we walked in we knew this was a hotel which is attentive to detail. The woman who checked us in was friendly and had a very inviting presence. She showed us where the museums were, gave us a map and explained how easy the walk would be to the area we wanted to go. The lobby is a super mix of the classic, historical era and new and modern. The room was even better. Comfy bed, pillows, great bathroom with nice products Super view of the Lake!!!We loved our stay and would return."
70,251,"Mar 4 2009 	fantastic remodeled choice!	This hotel was perfect for us. We were attending a convention at McCormick Place. While the Hilton next door was a convention hotel, we booked a fantastic room for a fraction of the price. Travelzoo was running a promotion for $99 and we still got the amenities of the free shuttle, with restaurants and a bar were all just next door.Our room was fantastic, very well furnished, lit, it was laid out wonderfully, and the bed was unbelievably comfortable.We will definitely stay again for that price!Would have given a 5 rating if just for a few important things.The woman at the front seemed overworked, the hotel was obviously understaffed.We called down and explained the honor bar would not open, we were simply told &quot;yes it does open&quot;, well two of us are not wrong, and isn't the guest supposed to be right? Someone should have come up to check it. If we could not open it there is a problem. Whatever, we went next door to Kitty O'Shea's instead.Also we got a wake up call early in the morning, we were up, but when we informed the woman at the front that WE had NOT asked for a wake up call, instead of an apology I was told that , Yes we did. Huh??? Even my colleague was flabbergasted, what if we were sleeping in!Sorry, we were very polite, and to be told WE were the problem not once but twice really needs to be addressed by management."
71,251,"Feb 18 2009 	Fabulous Place and Fantastic People !	I stayed at the Blackstone recently for business. The management has done a fabulous job of renovatiing this &quot;Grand Dame&quot; of Chicago. The lobby is a combination of trendiness and old world elegance. The rooms are simply superb, crisp linen, comfortable relaxing chair, flat screen tv, and the bathrooms are some of the nicest, with the club level room (Hubbard Place Room) having a tv bulit into the bathroom mirror. The location is quite convenient, and the staff extremely courteous and helpful. Special thanks to Mark and Tom at the front desk for accommodating my special room requests. I would like to stay nowhere else when in Chicago."
72,251,"Feb 15 2009 	Great View	Ever since this hotel was remodeled, I have wanted to spend the night. The rates have always been a little steep for me, so it wasn't until the economy hit hard was I able to swing the rate. I was on cloud &quot;9&quot; for my opportunity to stay here during Valentines Day weekend. Everything met or exceeded my expectations. The room was ready early as we checked in around noon. The room was well designed and the view was just the best I have ever had in Chicago. I could see all the way from Navy Pier to Soldier's field. I love the size of the hotel, big enough to offer services; Starbuck's, Spanish restaurant, nice bar etc, yet small enough to feel like any request would be met with good results. I can't really comment on the service, as we never really needed anything. It was all right there. It was a great stay. It is my new favorite hotel in Chicago!!!"
73,251,"Feb 8 2009 	Better than expected!	We stayed at the Blackstone instead of the Hilton for the Cubs Convention and could not have been happier. For the view we got (the lake, Navy Pier, Grant Park, the museum campus), the price was outta this world! $160/night (book direct on Marriott's web-site for best rates I found). The staff was more than accomodating - showing us all the historical points of the hotel. Neil was the best! We felt like we were staying at a real expensive hotel for the service we received. The restaurant was not really for kids (at least our kids said &quot;blah&quot;) but a taxi can take you to lots of good places to eat. If we go back downtown and need to stay in that area, we will DEFINITELY stay at the Blackstone again."
74,251,"Jan 25 2009 	Convenience and comfort	The hotel is the nicest I've stayed in the downtown area, ultra modern mixed with historical charm. The entire staff was very helpful and friendly. The beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are big. I'll definitely stay here again."
75,251,Jan 15 2009 	Chic Stay	Nicely appointed property! Huge bathrooms and comfy beds. The service was excellent!
76,251,"Jan 5 2009 	Amazing	Wow. We were very impressed with this hotel. This was our first trip to Chicago. We stayed the first two nights at The Tremont on Chestnut Street. No complaints at that hotel either, but this was a pleasant change. Renaissance are always amazing, but this was the best yet. All service was spectacular too. Let me continue by saying what an amazing deal this was. We booked a special of $119 a night, which included breakfast for 2 @ the Mercat (our bill was $40+ each day)!! What a deal. Due to our Marriott status, we were upgraded to the club level, Room 2018, lake view king room! The room was perfect. Very large, lots of windows, perfect view, terrific bathroom (with a tv in the mirror!). I couldnt have been happier. The hotel was very nice otherwise. We ate at the Mercat one evening for dinner. We found it to be quite expensive for the amount of food you get, tapas, is the name of a wide variety of appetizers in Spanish cuisines, but it was the perfect amount to have before going out and it was all delicious. We were even awarded a free dessert from the super nice server! There is a lot of history with this hotel, which made it extra interesting. As I said before, we were spoiled with the location of The Tremont, but this location was fantastic for certain things too. Museum campus was less than 20 minute walk away, you could see the Planetarium, Aquarium and Field Museum from our room actually. The L runs about two blocks behind the hotel as well, so that is walking distance too. We inadvertently walked from our hotel to the Sears Tower too, but that was quite a haul in the freezing temperatures, but possible. There were not too many entertainment options super close at night. We were able to walk to Bar Louie, a couple blocks away, but there is a Bar Louie in Newport, KY, near Cincinnati so that wasnt new for us. There were a couple other bars nearby, but we were just playing it safe considering it was so late. Otherwise, terrific experience. I cant say we would pay the typical $200+ for this hotel, although it is worth it, I would rather pay half that and be in a more walkable area. We spend so little time in our hotel room when traveling."
77,251,"Jan 1 2009 	The Blackstone is AMAZING!!	The Blackstone was amazing. The room was large and beautifully designed. The bathroom was oversized and luxurious. All of the finishes were top notch.The service was great too. From the front desk to the bell boys and doormen. Everyone was terrifically helpful.They even arranged their hotel car - Lexus 600LS - to take us to our New Year's event. An unexpected little luxury.And, which is highly unusual for a full service hotel - they offered free internet.The restaurant - Mercat - was awesome too. Spanish tapas. The food and service were excellent."
78,251,Dec 31 2008 	Great stay	This renovated hotel does not disappoint. Fireplace in the lobby was very appealing on a cold Chicago day. Have never enjoyed a better room or been treated better . Rate was excellent value for what we got. Recommend without reservation!
79,251,"Nov 4 2008 	Absolutely loved the Blackstone!	I cannot say enough good things about my stay at the Blackstone...was here on business in mid-October...absolutely EVERYONE working there treated us so wonderfully...I had stayed at the Palmer House back in March and the service didn't even begin to compare...if you have a choice, choose the Blackstone...you'll be very impressed!"
80,251,"Nov 2 2008 	Perfect Location	This hotel has recently reopened from remodeling. It is walking distance to Soldier Field and a short drive to the United Center. We checked in around 6 PM on a Saturday and had no problem. The room was very nice, no complaints. The bathroom has only a shower, no tub, and the Marriott beds were very comfortable as usual. The room did have a snack bar, but it was very expensive. It also had a flat-screen HDTV, with all four main ESPN channels (the most important ones). There is also a Starbucks in the hotel and a candy-counter. The hotel doesnt have a buffet and room service was way too expensive so we just went over to the Hilton (which is just across the street) and ate a very good buffet breakfast at The Pavilion for half the price ($22 per person). Check-out wasnt a problem either, and theyll valet your car for you. They even let us keep our car there after we checked out so we could go to the Bears game without driving around forever trying to find a parking place. It is a lengthy walk to Soldier Field, but it is worth it just to keep your car there."
81,251,"Oct 28 2008	Amazing Hotel; great location!!!	This is one of the nicest Marriott or Hilton hotels I've ever stayed at. This is a nice compliment seeing as I usually do about 280 nights/ year!! :) I heard they finished the renovation in 8 yrs and the Beatles Yogi bought this place and paid $125 million for the renovation. it sat vacant for 9 years. As you'll see in the pictures I've attached, the property looks more like a super trendy/hip boutique hotel. The staff is super nice and the executive lounge is very spacious and super classy. The attached tapas restaurant was also phenomenal and highly regarded in the area.I will definitely stay here again if I get the chance!!"
82,251,"Oct 20 2008 	Excellent Stay	I stayed at the Blackstone for work and pleasure. Got an excellent room with a view of the Lake. The room was very quiet, the bed very comfortable, the shower terrific, and the bathroom very modern. The location is also excellent, tho a bit of a walk from from Water Tower. I would stay there again and highly recommend."
83,251,Oct 14 2008 	Unbelievable!!	I have never been treated so well. I can't believe how friendly everyone was. We got an unbelievable room. Very big and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was awesome! There was even a tv in the mirror! We will definately go back.
84,251,"Sep 29 2008 	Great Hotel! I highly recommend	I must say that I was just HAPPY to get a room on priceline at a price that my company could afford in downtown Chicago, much less this one! I had never heard of the Blackstone, my ignorance, but now I can't let it go! I even extended my trip I enjoyed it so much! The lobby and Art Hall are just beautiful! The hotel was carefully restored and is just stunning. The rooms are bright and airy, with nice finishings and great Lather products in the marble-filled bathroom. The ipod docking station was perfect for my iPhone. The hotel is quiet, a calm oasis in the middle of the city. I loved the leather Eames chair in the room as well. I would have liked to been a little further north on Michigan, but hey, we can't have it all, right? The service, to me, was what really made me go and write a review. Friendly, professional, and just eager to please. There is also a great Tapas place and a 'real' Starbucks (not just a kiosk with a thermos) in the hotel, on the main level, if you are interested. I would 100% recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again!"
85,251,"Sep 22 2008 	Pleasant Surprise	My wife and I had originally booked a room at the Hyatt, but due to issues outside of the Hyatt's control they reserved a room for us at the Blackstone. We were very pleasanty surprised. The rooms have all been nicely updated and are very modern. The location lends itself well to anyone wanting to visit the Grant or Millenium Park, the Museum Campus, or Navy Pier. If you were up for a little exercise you could walk to shopping on the Miracle Mile or take a short cab ride.We had our two small children along, but the hotel is probably best suited for couples. We'd love to come back for a weekend without the kids."
86,251,Sep 3 2008 	Really Enjoyed the Location and the Staff	My husband and I stayed here for 4 days and 3 nights during the Labor Day weekend. We typically visit Chicago at least once a year and this is the first time we've stayed at the Blackstone. The location was great - we had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan and Grant Park. We were able to walk to the Shedd Aquarium and some of the museums in though there was a free trolley available just steps away from the hotel on Michigan Ave. The staff was friendly and seemed genuinely concerned about whether we were enjoying our stay. The only disappointments were not getting the fridge we requested with our reservation until the second day of our stay and some issues with the room thermostat. The room never quite cooled off to the temperature we set and it was a little warmer than Labor Day usually is in Chicago. Those were not huge issues and the staff was very apologetic about them -- we would definitely stay here again.
87,251,"Sep 2 2008 	What a Great Place!	After receiving a couple of suggestions of hotels near the Auditorium Theater in Chicago, I settled on The Blackstone. It was a birthday surprise weekend for my wife. All I can say is she loved it!The Blackstone has been closed for about 8 years. It was due to become condos but the deal fell through and the Marriott Corp. picked up the property. We were somewhat nervous when the hotel wasn't listed in any of the guide books we had. The reason for not being listed is the hotel has only been reopened for about 5 months. There was no reason to be nervous.We checked in early on a Friday morning without any difficulty whatsoever. We were there at about 10:00am, but our room was ready so they allowed us to check right in. We were told by the front desk that we had been upgraded to a lake view room. Our room was on the 14th floor overlooking both Michigan Ave and Balbo. It was a corner room that had it's own entry hallway! On the lake side we had 2 huge windows and a third smaller window. The Balbo side had one huge window. The decor is very modern although the hotel dates back to the early 1900's. The bathrooms are all marble with huge walk-in showers and rainfall shower heads. Again the bathroom fixtures are all very modern styled. The king bed was super comfortable with lots and lots of pillows.Our weekend package included breakfast, so we ate both mornings at the Mercat restaurant. It was very nice but a bit pricey.One floor of the hotel is called the Art Hall. While we were checking out the Art Hall, one of the hotel folks asked if we had seen the ballroom. Of course we hadn't and he opened the doors of Art Hall which put us in the balcony of the ballroom. It was awesome. A brilliant flower patterned rug was the focal point of the room which had just been finished and was going to host their first wedding this coming weekend.The hotel lobby is again a mix of old world hotel with a modern touch. All very cool. The staff was there whenever you needed them and everyone was very eager to please. Our package included Citypasses for the 2 of us. They had run out, so the concierge just told us to go see whatever museums we wanted and save the receipts and they would reimburse us. That worked out very well as we did want to make the most of every minute we had in Chicago, and waiting around for passes wasn't on our itinerary.I would highly recommend this hotel. It is very beautifully restored and the staff is very eager to please."
88,251,"Sep 2 2008 	What a Great Surprise for her Birthday!	I decided on a surprise for my wife in the city. Unfortunately, like many others, family life and children don't always allow us the opportunity for romantic getaways. I searched for the right place and I sure am glad that I found The Blackstone Hotel. Located sweetly on Michigan Ave, across the street from Grant Park. This was ultra convienent because it was also the weekend of the Chicago Jazz Festival. First thing we noticed when we went in was the nostalgic lobby (except of course the Starbucks downstairs). The employees were friendly and courteous and gave us our room on the 18th floor. The Deluxe suite was loaded with modern decor an amenities that were hard not to love (HD flatscreen TV, iHome alarm clock, etc.) The bathroom was spacious with quite a unique (in a good way) shower. The only thing lacking was great water pressure. But probably the most important aspect, the bed, was right on point. Spacious and comfortable king with down comforter and down pillows. What's not to enjoy?I plan for us to go back again. It definitely left a mark on us, and we loved our getaway. I imagine you will too."
89,251,"Sep 1 2008 	Didn't want to leave!	My husband and I had friends who had their wedding and reception at the Blackstone on Aug. 30th. According to the staff, it was the first wedding at the hotel since the renovations. We were both in the wedding party and were privy to many of the things behind the scenes that the guests were not. I speak for both my husband and I when I say that we were blown away at the level of service and the quality of the stay over the course of the weekend. Our friends had hired a wedding planner, but the staff at the hotel , especially Flavia, were the ones who really made the wedding day as special as it was. All of the staff were very accomodating and attentive to the bride as well as the groom, going above and beyond making sure that needs were met and that everything was taken care of. The rooms were wonderful, modern touches but very comfortable. The bride had booked the &quot;Smoking&quot; suite (one of the rooms with quite a bit of political history) for her over the weekend. We have NEVER seen a room as spectacular as this -the view overlooked Buckingham Fountain, Navy Pier and Lake Michigan, there were 2 bathrooms and the master bathroom has a TV in the mirror and there was a bedroom a sitting room and a combined dining and living room. The crystal ballroom was where the reception was held. The room was amazing and the hotel staff, including a manager, was present during the entire night to make sure that things ran smoothly. We live in Chicago and could have easily gone home, but wanted our time at the Blackstone to be extended as long as possible so we were more than happy to have stayed overnight. This was the best hotel we have ever stayed in, this includes the Ritz Carlton in St. Thomas we stayed at for our honeymoon, and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to have a wedding."
90,251,"Aug 18 2008 	A Step Back into History	Traveled back to Chicago to celebrate our wedding anniversary. After looking at numerous hotels on North Michigan Ave. we tried something different, stayed on the garden side of South Michigan, and are we glad we did!! Everyone, from the front desk clerk to the maids were very nice. The room was Outstanding. Compared to the cost for the hotels on Michigan Ave. The Blackstone is a diamond in the ruff. After a 128 million dollar remodel, this will be my hotel to stay for years to come. I can't find anything negative about the property and made a reservation as soon as we got home to stay again next month. The view from our room wasn't the best, but walk out the doors and one block away is Grant Park, a few more blocks is the Lakefront. You can't go wrong with the Blackstone!!"
91,251,"Aug 11 2008 	Wonderful Hotel Great Staff	There were 8 of us that stayed at the Blackstone on 8/9/08 for a Cubs baseball game. I booked 3 rooms through priceline and got a really good deal going that way. I was excited to see the hotel we got, and was looking forward to my trip back to Chicago. At check in we were informed there were no double beds available, which kind of put us in a bind since we had 2 couples sharing one room, plus there were no cots available, so we had 4 people in a king bed. I do have to say they were very apologetic and did bring us extra pillows and blankets, plus upgraded us to the 20th floor. Unfortunately when you book with priceline you can not request certain types of rooms. The rooms are very well decorated and very clean. Being on the 20th floor we had a decent view of the skyline. We did not eat at the restaurant, but did stop in for bloody marys before leaving for the game, and that was one of the best bloody marys I have ever had. The red line is only a few blocks from the hotel, and not hard to find. There are a few bars within walking distance, including Legends (Buddy Guy's bar), unfortunately when we went up there on Saturday night they wanted a $15 cover. Since none of us are big blues fans we decided to skip that and walk up to the small bar on the corner that had very good prices on drinks and very friendly service. If you want to go to the Navy Pier it is about a $9 - $10 cab ride. We did go to Dick's Last Resort for supper. One of my favorite places in downtown Chicago. The rest of the trip was the Cubs-Cards game, so spent a lot of time around Wrigley and hitting the Cubby Bear. Checkout on Sunday was very fast and efficient. They made a point to make sure our stay was without any trouble. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. They definitely have done a great job of upgrading this hotel, and the staff makes it #1."
92,251,"Aug 7 2008	Neat stylish retro hotel	Just stayed a night at this hotel. Booked an oversized room, and it lived up to the billing - 2 Queens, good sized desk, lounge chair, very large bathroom, and lots of room between everything. Kind of felt like an apartment it was so big. Decorated in a chic, retro decor that works a lot better than some of the minimalist retro properties I've stayed at elsewhere, it really works here and gives the property a luxorious feel. Property overall had a neat feel too, with good service at front desk and tapas restaurant in front lobby (tasty food too). Property undergoing some renovations, something you might want to ask about, but I was in an upper floor and it was a non-issue for me. I really liked this hotel, wouldn't change a thing and would definitely stay there again."
93,251,"Aug 7 2008 	Cost me extra to stay here	I stayed here as the media guest of a large company, and though I'm happy to report that the rooms are very nicely updated, they are also quite small and you're going to pay extra ($15) for DSL internet access. The beds are great and the door staff are very friendly. The only problem is that the desk staff are kids and barely know what they're doing. I had given them my credit card for incidentals and reminded them when I checked out, &quot;Now, you're going to charge the room to THAT card (my sponsor's) and not THIS card, right?&quot; Confused, 21 year old called over the 25 year old manager, who pointed out the card the room was supposed to be charged to, and I was assured there would be no problem. Sure 'nuff, I get home and find they've charged $600 to the wrong card and my checking account is now overdrawn. $100 in overdraft fees and hours of attempts to fix it, I'm still waiting for my money to be refunded a week later, and they've already charged the other card. Does that sound like a 5-Star hotel? Not to me.I won't be back."
94,251,"Jul 25 2008 	Unique and Hip while maintaining the historic charm	I work for another hotel company but our hotels were full so I booked here as I had heard a lot about this recently renovated hotel. I was not dissapointed! They have kept the historic charm but at the same time it looks very trendy and cool. The hallways and public areas are unlike most cookie-cutter hotels. My room had a wonderful view of the lake and Fountain, and while it may have been a little small, it made up for it with a large stone entry cooridor and expansive bathroom with the largest showerhead I have ever seen. Healthclub was great as well, very large with windows and VERY hi-tech treadmills. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only issue was that room service was quoted as 45 min and took well over an hour - hotel was pretty busy."
95,251,"Jul 17 2008 	You will definitely like the Blackstone	I just finished a four night stay at the Blackstone and just thought it was great. The remodel came out great, the room was very large and the staff couldn't have been friendlier.I searched a number of places before deciding on the Blackstone and it is close to a 5 star hotel but at a much better price.The new lounge and restaurant on site are also excellent. The restaurant seems to be a hot spot for locals, probably because it's new and has received good reviews, and that just makes the whole experience that much better.I stayed with my brother and father (Cubs weekend) and we ended up with a room with two queen beds - which, as it turns out, means the room is even larger (huge, even) and the roll-away didn't make any difference. The room was great and my dad thought it was a suite it was so big.Can't say enough good things. I'm sure people can have bad experiences (just like any hotel) but the Blackstone itself is definitely a good call."
96,251,"Jul 13 2008 	Furnishings and location were nice service was not	They screwed up our reservation. Instead of a &quot;deluxe lakeview room&quot; we got a view of a brick wall on the street. The front desk clerk blamed it on Expedia. I've never had any hotel complain about Expedia before. WHen I called Expedia they tried to take control of the situation, but the hotel was uncooperative, even though the hotel had faxed Expedia a signed confirmation of the room type, according to Expedia. Manager Kate was a cold fish. She said that the Blackstone did not guarantee the room type. I pointed out that I had paid $50 more to get the view. She didn't offer any solution. I said Id take the lesser room for the usual price. She emitted heavy sighs and said shed call Expedia. I called Expedia 30 minutes later but Kate had not called them. I decided not to ruin the day and gave up. Upon checkout, the manager (nice black guy, didn't catch his name) called Expedia and confirmed that the charges had been reduced. Other problems: a clerk took our wakeup call request, but someone called at 6:30 instead of 9:30 (on Sunday!). I never got back to sleep because of all the sirens and street noise. The shower door was clear and the bathroom door was semi opaque glass, so you might not want to share this room with someone unless you are good friends. Beds were comfy for one but not for 2 people. Decor was pretty posh but more contemporary corporate than homey. Parking was $46. The valet guys were very nice. The location was perfect for Taste of Chicago."
97,251,"Jul 6 2008 	Expensive but wonderful	I stayed at the Blackstone for a work related event. It was really beautiful. Very nicely restored. If you can, try for the Lake View rooms. I had one and had an incredible view of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier. There are fire works at Navy Pier on Wed and Sat and I got a great view of them from my window. The staff was 100% helpful to me. Definitely recommend it, especially if it's a business expense!"
98,251,"Jul 2 2008	Wonderful Stay!	Just returned from a four night stay at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago and had a wonderful stay.I called the hotel a few days before arriving and asked if I was able to take the &quot;El&quot; (subway/train) to the hotel. The concierge told me that I can take the Blue Line from O'Hare airport to the Jackson station and grab a cab and it would only be a few minutes from there. If you don't have too much luggage, you can easily switch to the Red Line at Jackson and take one stop to Harrison and the hotel is only a couple of blocks away. Train tickets only cost $2 a person so it can be a very cheap way to get to the hotel. The train ride will take close to an hour. Once you get out of the Harrison stop, just look up at the skyline. It is very easy to landmark the hotel with its red exterior and distinctive green top. The hotel is located on the corner of S Michigan Avenue and Balbo.As many have noted, staff are very friendly and greet you as you enter and exit the hotel. Check in was quick and we were given a room on the 17th floor with views of Soldier Field, the Field Museum, Shredd Aquarium and Adler Planetarium. The hotel throughout is beautifully and tastefully decorated. I particularly liked that the room had a little collection of books on Chicago. I thought it was a nice touch. The alarm clocks also had an ipod dock so you could listen to your ipod in the room. There is a coffee maker in the room and a Starbucks downstairs so there was no problems getting your morning caffeine. We were in town just in time for Taste of Chicago and it took place in Grant park so we were literally across the street from all the action. It was an easy walk to many of the cities attractions. We walked all the way down through Grant Park, Millenium Park, to Navy Pier, through the Magnificent Mile and to the Hancock Building.Everything exceeded expections except for Housekeeping. They provided lush and comfy bathrobes and I wanted some slippers so I called for some only to be told they were out. Daily housekeeping I found was inconsistent and didn't go as good as a job as I would have liked. But that is a minor complaint.Overall this was a wonderful hotel and I would highly recommend."
99,251,"Jun 19 2008 	Beautiful and friendly	The hotel is beautifully elegant, traditional yet contemporary. Staff greets you at the door upon entry and exit, very helpful and accomodating. My room was immaculately kept, room service responsive even thought it was a very busy week for downtown hotels. My only regret is that my wife was not there to share it with me. I had a great view of the lake and parks across the street and enjoyed one night of fireworks from the 21st floor. I did not eat in the restaraunt, I opted for the Hilton across the street but wish I had tried it. The only thing lacking was shuttle transportation to McCormick Place but the HIlton provided that. You will not be disappointed with your stay, I highly recommend it.David Gulotta, New Iberia Louisiana"
100,251,"Jun 14 2008 	Very pleased--location non-smoking new refurb etc . . .	Thrilled with location--only about 2 blocks from the Red line. Being on the back of the hotel (17th floor) the noise from the El was noticeable. Had the noise been constant it would have drifted into the background and been more white noise than anything. In fact it almost sounded like the ocean. But since the noise came and went with each train it seemed to stand out a little. I usually travel with a portable fan but didn't this time. Had I had it on, I wouldn't have been bothered by the El noise. This wouldn't prevent me from staying here again--I'd just be sure to bring my fan.Room was confortable, if a tiny bit small. The large bathroom and tiled foyer in the room made up for it. Decor in the room was excellent.The walk-in shower had a glass wall separating it from the rest of the bathroom. The wall wasn't long enough as a little water pooled on the floor.Getting back to our room one day at about 5:00pm discovered that the room hadn't been straightened up yet. After a quick call to the front desk, they apologized and sent someone up while we were out at dinner. Really was a non-issue for us but wanted to mention it as example of how quickly the hotel staff responded.Didn't eat on property as prices seemed excessive. Prefer to eat in the local/family run places anyway. Would recommend this hotel to friends."
101,251,"Jun 10 2008	Blackstone excellence	Superb service and staff, excellent room, comfortable beds, excellent internet..what more is there to day?"
102,251,"Jun 9 2008 	PERFECT!!!	If you're looking for an eclectic, modern spin on a historic hotel, then this is the place for you! Known as one of Al Capone's favorites, and completed in 1910, this one is one from the movies! On Michigan Avenue, within walking distance of nearly EVERYTHING in Chicago. Valet was exceptional, check-in was a breeze. The on-site Tapa's restaurant was wonderful. Our room was decorated to the &quot;T&quot; for a restored hotel. Tiled floors, down comforters, bright colors and EXTREMELY clean. Our view in the day was nothing to write home about, but the night view of the Sears Tower and Hancock was SPECTACULAR! The other side of the hotel would face Michigan Ave and the Lake, so it would be even more beautiful. We loved every minute that we spent in our room (almost as much as our Chicago experience itself!) Would recommend again and again and again! We'll be back!"
103,251,"Jun 3 2008 	Trying to be a Kimpton hotel	I was there for a conference from May 22-28. I would give it a 3.5 because of some issues, but some issues were probably specific to our situation. The Good:1. newly refurbished, modern furniture etc.2. very clean room3. very nice staff4. cute bar, although a little small5. nonsmoking 6 Starbucks in front7. good lunch restaurant8. great locationThe Bad:1. Even though this was a conference and there were 4 of us in the room, we had a difficult time getting them to guaranteee 2 beds 2. Beds were soft and there were too many pillows. 3. Too much cuteness without practicalities - e.g., the shower stall door went from floor to ceiling, but opening it produced a lot of noise in the bedroom; lots of metal bathroom fixtures (soap dish, garbage can), which also made noise if touched; only one towel rack in bathroom, so we couldn't conserve our towels3. Housekeeping continually left us only decaf coffee. They quickly brought us more when we called, but this happened reapeatedly.4. We were overcharged for internet use and for parking (we didn't have a car). It took a long time for them to sort this out when we departed.5. Bar closed early on Memorial Day - we were told it was last call, but then people (apparently bartender's friends) came in and were served.Special IssueWe asked for a fridge and microwave because of a medical condition requiring preparing own food. They provided a fridge, but the only outlet in which it coudl be plugged was controlled by a hall-switch by the door. Even though we put a sign over the switch, housekeeping kept turning it off. Hotel couldn't provide a microwave and told us that the Executive Floor was still under construction (which it wasn't). My husband had to call them to come get his food and take it downstairs to be microwaved. Bit of a pain, but in the future we know to find a hotel with a kitchette."
104,251,"May 17 2008 	Beautiful hotel but not without a couple of gripes	Stayed here in the 30th April 2008. Was extremely luck as the night we checked in we were informed it was the official opening and were treated to explore the hotel and sip champagne. In the ballroom we ended mingling with Chicago's high and mighty. After a good start it got even better. The room was beautiful, fantastic bed, flat screen tv and tastefully designed BUT as much as I don't want to fault The Blackstone I unfortunatley have to. I brought to attention 3 times the fact that our bedside lamps were not working and nothing was done, it was not a big deal seeing as we were only staying 2 night but still after 3 complaints even an acknowlegment would have done for me . I think they should also reconsider their windows. We woke really early from the sounds of the morning rushhour and L train. I understand it's downtown Chicago but I never had to wear earplugs in a hotel before. Again under the understanding of location and prices etc.... I still thought that the breakfast in room was ridiculously over priced. It cost nearly $70 for two unspectacular omelettes and a pot of coffee, $18 for the coffee alone and not as good as the Starbucks at the front of the hotel. There was not much choice on the menu either. Ironically I really enjoyed staying in the blackstone. All the staff were very friendy. The location is perfect for anyone visiting Chicago as you are right in the middle of all the action. Shopping is 5 mins left as you walk out the front door, tourist trails and spots are right on your doorstep. The gym has all state of the art equipment with beautiful views from the 6th floor. A hotel that is steeped in history and class, somewhere I would definitely stay again"
105,251,May 3 2008 	Awsome Hotel	Before my stay I heard some bad reviews about this hotel and staff. Upon my arrival there was nothing but top notch care and pampering from every employee at this hotel. The hotel is breathtaking and in a perfect location to transit for anywhere in the city. The rooms are all done in modern time while the hotel is like going back in time with the ballroom to the lobby. while there I could just go back in time to think of all the festivities that happened there long ago. I highly recommend this hotel.
106,251,Apr 16 2008 	Outstanding Hotel - lots of hostory wrapped in a brand new look	Don't normally like to stay in older hotels but the Blackstone is a brand new old hotel. Lots of history wrapped in a brand new look. Rooms are completely redone and modern. Hotel staff was very friendly and attentive. The hotel gym was larger than most I have been in and had brand new equipment. The restuarant on the first floor is also very good if you can get in and don't want to go to far from the hotel.
107,251,"Apr 15 2008 	Great new hotel with central location	Just got back from 2 nights at the Blackstone. Room was excellent and spacious - marble floors in entry and bathroom, flat screen tv, high end furniture. Really the service is what makes the hotel stand out. You could not walk by any employee without them saying hi to you, holding the door open, etc.I would highly recommend the hotel if you are planning to go to the museums. It is about a 10-15 minute walk through Grant Park to the Field Museum, Aquarium, and Planetarium, but you cannot get much closer in terms of a hotel. The Art Museum is about a 10 minute walk also the other direction.If you are taking the train into the city, get off at the Van Buren Station and its an easy walk to the hotel (you can use this same stop to get to the Science Museum). Otherwise parking is $46/night at the hotel or around the corner on Wabash you can overnight for a little under $15 - we didn't go this route but we walked past this cheaper garage on our way back to the hotel one day."
108,251,"Apr 9 2008 	Wonderful gem with few rough edges	Our stay at the brand new/greatly historic Blackstone was a terrific experience. The renovations have been very well done, adding contemporary furnishings and gadgets to the classic structure. Our only issues were with some service aspects which appear to be not well worked out yet, such as housekeeping not servicing our room until 6 pm and a clump of valet parkers who ignored us (we ended up in the Hilton lot across the street, marginally less exhorbitant). The hotel has a great future, building on a spectacular architectural treasure in a perfect location."
109,251,"Apr 8 2008	The Blackstone - New Chicago Landmark	The Blackstone (So. Mich. Ave. @ Balbo next to the Hilton Chicago) has been beautifully rehabbed and updated by Marriott as a Renaissance property. Having stayed there in '99 when it was independently managed, the improvement is impressive indeed. Friends and I booked 3 separate rooms and all of us were more than satisfied - especially given we had senior rates. My large, marble bathroom had a walk-in shower with a rainfall shower head and top-of-the-line amenities. The staff to a person is eager-to-please. The location is hard to beat being within walking distance of Millennium Park, the Art Institute, Orchestra Hall, and the El. There's an on-site Starbucks and a Spanish-themed bar and restaurant which, while pricey, features well-prepared, and imaginative food. Being as new as it is, the staff really goes out of its way to make one's stay as pleasurable as possible."
110,251,"Apr 1 2008 	Live up to my expectations	When I booked this hotel I had very high expectations, I have already seen the pics on their web page and it simply looked fabulous. I have to say that The Blackstone didn't let me down. The rooms are cozy, you feel at home. They really have made a good job of the renovation. During our stay, not everything went smoothly, we had to move to another room because of some piping works. However we never felt something wrong with our room. Despite this little hitch, my evaluation is 10 out of 10.I highly recommend this hotel if you can afford it."
111,251,"Mar 24 2008 	Beautiful Renovation Amazing Hotel	Went to the Blackstone following their major renovation and must say it has to be one of the nicest hotels in Chicago now. Classic finish with some modern touches. The lobby is beautiful and the meeting rooms (including the famous ballroom) are exquisite. The hotel rooms themselves are quite nice - flat screens, cool wallpapering done in the bathrooms. I prefer this to the Drake anyday. I received a tour of the famous room where they held the Republica National Convention (The Smoking Room I believe they called it) which is going to be converted into a suite and is still under renovation. Also got to see the meeting room downstairs that used to be a barbershop where Al Capone got his hair cut. The staff here are very friendly and they also just opened up an amazing tapas restaurant in the building as well. HIGHLY suggested for Chicago."
112,251,Nov 19 2009 	Trs confortable trs beau propre et bien situ... mais bruyant
1,252,Just OK	You can tell they are cutting back. I know times are hard but when you charge $300 you expect fast service. Room service took way too long and I was late for my meeting.
2,252,"Nov 25 2009 	Couldn't have asked for a better hotel experience!	My friends and I stayed at the Drake from 11/18-11/22. We came to see the Oprah show, and we also spent the weekend shopping. We had such a great experience. The hotel staff was super friendly, especially Tom Marshall at checkin. We were upgraded for free from a room with a king size bed to a room with 2 bathrooms and 2 oversized queen beds. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a great visit. The hotel was clean and very nice, and quiet considering the Light's festival was that weekend. The location of the hotel was perfect...ideal for shopping and enjoying the Mag. Mile. I highly recommend the Drake."
3,252,"Nov 10 2009 	Great overnight stay !	Great overnight stay at The Drake on 11/7. I reserved the room at a great price via Priceline. I sent the manager an email requested a renovated room and he made it happen! I was pleased with the follow through, especially since we were paying a lower rate. Yes, the rooms are a bit dated but that is by design. If you are looking for sleek and modern, stay at W. Parking was a bit steep at $49 but that includes in &amp; out, which we utilized to pack up at the end of the stay utnil we were done shopping. Overall, great stay and I would recommend to anyone looking for a night away."
4,252,"Nov 4 2009 	Perfect Getaway	My wife &amp; I stayed at The Drake Hotel this past weekend for the first time and we were extremely satisfied with our experience. We were celebrating her birthday, and I had notified the hotel of this a month before our arrival. Upon check in we were graciously upgraded to a Junior Lake View suite, and the desk staff member wished my wife happy birthday. Which came as such a surprise to my wife because she had no idea I even contacted the hotel!The room was dignified &amp; charming, with the best view of Lake Michigan we had ever seen. The bed was meticulously made, and extremely soft and comfortable. They also positioned the bed perfect in the room so you could gaze out all the wrap around windows in the suite!! We spent the day relaxing and enjoying the room since it was rainy outside. To top off everything we got a knock from room service and the hotel management had sent us up a dessert plate, sparkling water, &amp; birthday cake! My wife was elated and it truly made us feel special.We will definitely stay at The Drake Hotel again and I would recommend this hotel highly based on our experience. Also, I am a Chicago native and you can't beat the location if looking to shop, eat, or hit nightlife. Everything is in close proximity!"
5,252,"Oct 23 2009 	excellent	we spent 4 nights at the Drake and enjoyed a superb experience. The room was large andincluded a mini fridge. the bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in, simply luxurious.Check-in and check-out was quick, and the hotel staff were most courteous.I will definetly stay there again when I visit Chicago."
6,252,Oct 21 2009 	Old and Tired	I've always wanted to stay at this hotel due to the reputation and location. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and I booked the room online. We had reservations at a fancy Italian restaurant right across the street and I thought everything would be perfect. When we checked in I realized I should have splurged on a suite and asked if I could upgrade. The agent (as if reading from a script) said since I booked online she could not do that. I explained that it was our 20th anniversary and my wife was looking forward to a special weekend. She barely looked up and handed me a key to a room that had not been touched for at least 25 years! The bathroom had chipped tile and dull marble. I was shocked at the state of the place. We spent as little time as possible in the room and tried to make the best of it. For $300.00 I've stayed at nicer and more plush Hiltons or Marriotts. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone! The doorman was very nice however.
7,252,"Oct 20 2009 	Top Ratings Across the Board for this Very Top Hotel - THE BEST!	My friends and I were elated when we got tickets to the Oprah show, but our stay at The Drake was the icing on the cake. The location couldn't be better -- steps from Chicago's historic Water Tower, the John Hancock building, and all the fabulous shops and restaurants of the Magnificent Mile. The convenience factor was a saving grace for us as we were able to walk everywhere, minimizing cab fares, and could easily stop at the hotel to drop off shopping bags or relax between sites. Our two bathroom, double queen room was perfect for the four of us. We especially appreciated the extra bathroom when we had to get up early and all prep at once for Oprah. I would imagine that the same room configuration would be perfect for a family -- the room was so spacious that it even had a living room area and separate office nook!Every corner of the hotel exudes elegance, from the spectacular floral arrangement in the lobby to the recently renovated hallways and comfortable, upscale rooms. The staff was welcoming, helpful, and polite. The saltwater taffys on our pillows were a nice touch.If you want to make the most of your trip to Chicago, stay at The Drake. It truly offers the best of everything."
8,252,Oct 19 2009 	Good if you like twin beds	The hotel is beautiful. We were impressed until we got to the room and found out that the two beds we had requested were TWIN beds. I did not know any hotels had twin beds anymore. We should of been told that on the phone . We had three people in our party so we went down to desk and talked to &quot;Lorenzo&quot; but he would not help us at all.
9,252,Oct 18 2009 	Check out the room carefully	My wife and I stayed in The Drake earlier this month. For the first couple of nights we had a room which could interconnect with two neighbours. Sound proofing is minimal and a group of tennagers arrived in the room next door. They may as well have been in our room. Sleep was impossible and the hotel completely failed to shut them up. Having relocated to a second room the following day the stay improved.Gym and leisure services are basic.
10,252,"Oct 16 2009 	Marvelous Stay at The Drake	My girlfriends and I recently stayed at The Drake Hotel during a visit to run in the Chicago Marathon. I had booked the room using Priceline, and was thrilled when The Drake Hotel popped up as our hotel. However, after reading some of the reviews on tripadvisor, I became a bit worried that we might end up in a small room needing renovation. I emailed the manager, Tom Thomas, to request the best possible room during our stay. Within a few hours, I received an email back from the Executive Assistant welcoming us in advance and assuring me that we would enjoy our stay. I kept my fingers crossed.We arrived a bit early for our stay (11:30a) and inquired about check-in, but the current guest had not checked out yet. We left our bags and went out for a bit. I called back at 1:30p, and the clerk (who politely remembered me) said our room was now ready.Upon entering the hotel, you can truly feel the emphasis they put on luxury. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, from the front desk clerks, to the concierge to the bell man. Everyone had a smile on their face and friendly things to say. The enormous flower display in the lobby fills the room with a lovely fragrance.When we checked in to our room, I could not have been more pleased! It was an enormous room, with two large beds and best of all two bathrooms. Perfect for three women! The beds were incredibly comfortable, with plenty of soft pillows and soft sheets. There was a large sitting area, nice TV, and even two large windows with a view. Everything was exceptionally clean and to a very high standard.If you are considering The Drake Hotel, I would suggest you book the hotel with confidence, and simply email the manager to ensure your room meets your expectations. We were thrilled with our stay and will definitely consider The Drake Hotel for future visits to downtown Chicago."
11,252,"Oct 13 2009 	Great Time	I stayed here for several nights. Granted we didn't spend too much time in the hotel, it was a great experience. I reccomend upgrading to the Executive Floors if you can."
12,252,"Oct 11 2009 	exceeded expectations	we live in Chicago, but wanted a weekend to just &quot;getaway&quot;, and ive always wanted to stay at The Drake, so he called and booked a weekend there a week before we went. We checked in around 6pm that friday (after work, of course!) to find that we were upgraded from our junior suite to an executive suite! The hotel is a historic hotel, a classic with old-skool furnishings. It truly is a beautiful site to see! (for those looking to stay at a *modern* hotel, this is NOT the place for you, unless you can appreciate what some have called &quot;grandma furnishings&quot; in other reviews...). The elevators have little couches in them (which gave me a good laugh) and i forced us to sit down on them every time we were in the elevator alone (no man in his right mind would do this publicly :) ). Each design in the hallway all the way down to the room was so detail oriented, you can tell the craftsmanship was of great quality. The hallways were nice and wide, no need to struggle getting down as you pass others on the way to the room. The room was FANTASTIC! It was a corner room with a lakeview. The parlor was huge with a couch, armoire (tv inside), large desk, and a table with 4 chairs. Then in the next room was the bedroom which had a king size bed that was SOFT and lovely, full with at least 6 pillows. Next room was the bathroom which had marble stairs leading up to a jacuzzi tub that could probably fit 4 people in it, a seperate standing shower and a double vanity. It was def a spacious, romantic room and we were pleased. Lots of towels available for use too, big towels, not the small ones that barely get around your body! The only thing I noticed was that the TVs were very outdated (had to at least be from early 90s), as well as the telephones... however, I can maybe see why as it keeps the &quot;old character&quot; of the hotel intact. I can appreciate that kind of stuff, esp when its creating the old-Chicago feel!Location wise, the Drake really is centrally located within the Mag Mile. Its one block north of the Hancock Tower and Water Tower Place, with ample shopping, a stone's throw from the beach, and a good walk to Navy Pier if you'd really like.We ate at the Drake Brothers Restaurant in the Drake every morning, as it was part of our package. Without the package, a breakfast buffet for 2 would cost $52, just to serve as an fyi. Some may say over priced, but why would you expect anything less from a 4-5 star hotel??? The food was delicious with a wide variety to choose from.Concierge service in the lobby was nice, very informative (to the people in front of us, at least) and was able to provide me with a bandaid when I asked for it - thanks Andrea!I loved this hotel and would suggest it to anyone coming in for a visit that wouldnt mind splurging on a nice hotel. :)"
13,252,"Oct 10 2009 	good time at the drake	We just got back from our trip to chicago/stay at the drake. this was our first trip to chicago. we agree with most of the previous hotel reviews. a beautiful hotel with an incredible history. the lobby and upper restaurant/bar are amazing and elegant. the food and service was great. we had one of our best meals at the Coq d'or bar downstairs. we stopped for there for a drink almost everynight and they had live music every evening. that was wonderful. everyone that worked at the hotel was helpful and friendly. it is also a good location. right across the street from bloomingdales. macy's is 2 blocks down the street and the john hancock building is next door. we only encountered two problems our entire stay.1. we prepaid for our hotel room ($247 usd for an executive suite room-10th floor) and it wasn't ready when we arrived at 8 pm. they said it wasn't cleaned yet, and then a few minutes later they said they was a maintenance problem. so they put us on another floor in a smaller room (with a lake view). which I felt was a down grade from what we had initially paid for. the next morning we went to complain and they did immediately, without hesitation put us in the room we had previously requested/paid for. the executive room was very large with a couch/sitting area, king bed, desk and chair and 2 closets. we were very happy with the room. the private lounge was also very nice. it had a lake view...with a cold breakfast buffet included with the price.I guess the main point I want to make is that PREPAID / PRESELECTED ROOMS DOESN'T GUARANTEE you anything. I was under the impression that the room we had prepaid for would be held and ready for us upon check-in...not the next day.2. my other problem is that my hotel room card was deactived the morning we were leaving. I left our room around 9 am and I couldn't get back into our room at 10 am. check-out isn't until noon. luckly my husband was there to let me in. what if I was alone and stepped out for a second in my PJ's...how embarrassing that could of been!overall, we enjoyed our stay. the rooms were very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. if you appreciate history and elegance this is a great hotel. a must see.p.s. we give it a 4* instead of 5* due to the room issues we had."
14,252,"Oct 9 2009 	Loved our stay at the Drake Hotel	My husband and I traveled to Chicago for our 15th anniversary and stayed at the Drake Hotel after doing some searching for a great hotel at a reasonable rate. We received exactly the deal we were hoping for and more! We took the train from Milwaukee and arrived way before check in time but they person at the desk said they gave us a free upgrade and were happy to keep our bags until the room was ready and even took our cell phone number so they could call. That worked out perfect as we were going to walk around the area anyway and were happy to have our bags taken care of. The location was within walking distance of restaurants, shopping and Oak Street Beach.....beautiful! And anything else was just a short cab ride away. We went to the beautiful Palm Court for drinks after dinner and there was a great dance band playing that night. We had breakfast at the Drake Brothers with amazing views of Michigan Avenue and the lake. Our room was huge and had 2 walls with windows. I'm sure it was one of the older rooms that hadn't been refurbished yet, but it was beautiful, none the less! This is a beautiful, historical hotel that should be on everyones &quot;got to stay&quot; list. I hope they continue to offer specials for rooms at reasonable rates or we may have ended up at some run of the mill hotel chain and missed this wonderful experience!"
15,252,"Oct 9 2009 	Lots of incredible history but overrated!	This hotel has incredible history and beautiful architecture but once you've seen all the magnificant common rooms (lobby, ballroom, Palm Court, old style elevators) it isn't any different than any other overpriced, 4 star historical hotel. Our friends were getting married in the ballroom so we thought that we would take this opportunity to stay at The Drake since I'm pregnant and it would be an easy escape for me to my room in the wee hours. Check in was at 3:00 and we were there on time as the wedding trolley was leaving at 5:30 and we needed time to get ready. At check in we were offered a deluxe upgrade on our king room but the hitch was that it wouldn't be ready for over an hour. Talk about dangling the carrot and yanking it away! We couldn't wait an hour and considering check in wasn't until 3:00 I can't imagine why the room wasn't ready. We settled for our existing king reservation (at $250) and found the room to be fine but of course our view was of the air conditioning units and we were next door to the Fitness area. So much for wedding party group booking bonus! I can't imagine how much money our friends spent for their wedding at The Drake but I'm sure they would have been mortified to hear about the rooms that their guests were given especially since they were &quot;promised&quot; that everyone under the group booking would be nicely taken care of. Pro's - decor was decent, slightly dated but clean. room was decent size, noise between rooms/floors was negligible. Bathroom was ok in size but only suitable for one person at a time. Con's - heating system was horribly loud, had to turn it off at night to sleep, no exhaust fan in bathroom, wireless access was not free, bottled water was $7.00 for a small bottle, split of wine was over $25, breakfast was over $25 per person with another 20% markup for room service. There was coffee in the room but I wasn't sure if it was free and the room service menu said it was $15 so we popped over to Starbucks instead. Parking was ok at $39 a night if you use the public parking lot two doors down - you can even charge it to your room tab. We ended arriving a day early and didn't have a room booked. On Hotwire we found a 3 star hotel for $63 a night in the magnificant mile area. We weren't getting in until 11:00 p.m. so we weren't that picky. The hotel ended up being the Holiday Inn Express. Of course for $63 our room overlooked the air conditioning units here as well but we had a very comfortable king bed, huge plasma tv, wonderfully decorated room, free breakfast, free wireless and a great location. The room was super small - basically just enough room for the king bed and a really small bathroom but for the money it was so much more worth it than The Drake. The building was beautiful, location was great, personnel were very friendly, self parking was around the corner. Ok, there's no ballroom, no Palm Court and Queen Elizabeth didn't stay here but does that really matter??? Save your money, skip The Drake, walk through it if you want to check it out, but there are plenty of beautiful hotels in the magnificant mile area for alot less money!"
16,252,"Oct 9 2009 	Horrible NO HEAT NO HOT WATER	The Drake greatly disappointed me: Valet lost my car and made me late to work The rooms don't have heat until the temperature is below 50 in your room The hot water is intermittent; no hot water often during a shower Management not interested in their problems Trash in the hall ways No wireless, only ethernet TV system is very dated, doesn't work well"
17,252,"Oct 9 2009 	Had a fabulous price - that made it a fantastic vacation	We had the most incredible price and the front desk seemed a bit put out by the low price that we were paying. However they were the only ones who didn't seem overly friendly. The wait staff in the restaurant, the staff at the lounge and the bellmen were wonderful. Our room didn't have a view of the lake, but it was a very nice room and it almost seemed like suite with the entry, sitting area and bedroom lay-out. We had family in the area who came to have dinner with us and when we took their teen daughters up to see the room, the 16 year-old said it was like walking through Titanic. And that does seem like an accurate description of the old-money feel in the decor. We were going to go on-line at the business center but the price seemed ridiculous and we're Hilton gold. I thought we have had free use as this is part of the Hilton chain."
18,252,Oct 9 2009 	Don't miss the scary butler!	My kids got a complte hoot out of the scary butler who's outside the flower shop/gift store on the ground floor. (He's motion activated and will speak when you come in.)Be sure not to miss it!
19,252,"Oct 8 2009 	Great location in a historical gem.	The Drake hotel in Chicago, IL is a historical gem. We went in August and got a great deal! You can't beat the location, right on the shore of Lake Michigan! The hotel is steeped in tradition and is an old fashioned, elegant hotel. If you like tradition, then this is probably the hotel for you.If you get a room with 2 beds, they are kind of small. However, the room was clean and the view was great. It was a peaceful hotel and the staff was pretty friendly. The hotel is surrounded by great shops and we loved the cafe downstairs. They also have tea time, which is really nice."
20,252,"Oct 6 2009 	The Drake is like home	My wife &amp; I have visited the Drake twice in 2 years for a mini-vacation. Since we rarely travel, I was reluctant to go to another hotel because we know the Drake (familiar territory). I have described it as a &quot;middle&quot; hotel, not too expensive, but not the cheapest either. i am amused by the complaints for different hotels and the mini-bar prices, etc. This is Chicago, everything is expensive. The liquor is in fact cheaper or about the same in the min-bar as in a regular bar (not the Drake bar). The rooms could stand upgrading, especially the carpets and the furniture. I feel a good portion of their income is from conventioneers, lots of those going on. The hotel is beautiful in the lobby, and the tea room service is great. They have a nice Espresso shop now, and a neat art gallery, and other shops. There is access to the beach right across the street, if you are so inclined. The concierge has never steered us wrong yet, and we used them a lot. We went out on my bday and he said just stroll over to Rush street and there are several places, which we did. Great time too, and very simple, one block away. I have read reviews about the maids rattling in the linen closet, but we stayed next to one (a closet) and it wasn't a problem. I also have read about problems with water pressure but ours was fine both trips.Our view wasn't anything special, but we didn't come for the view, and I feel we could have specified one, but the rate might have been more, not sure. We didn't eat in the restuarants but did have a burger in the bar. The guys out front always remember us when we need a cab, and are helpful. The bellhop took the time to point out features in the room for us (which we knew already) but it was nice. Finally, did everyone notice the Manager commenting on negative reviews on this site? I feel that is good follow-up. We will probably go back again next year, you can have a bad experience in any hotel. Our stays went very well."
21,252,"Sep 29 2009 	Beautiful Hotel	We had a good experience at the Drake. We got a good deal on Priceline but still got a newly updated room with 2 beds as we wanted. The place is still old (doors, carpet) but all have character. The lobby is gorgeous.We did not eat/drink there but there was a beautiful bar. Our only really bad experience was the concierge service, they were not at all helpful or even pay attention to what you are asking. Expensive internet also.Tips: Take the river architecture tour, wonderful."
22,252,"Sep 27 2009 	Where there's smoke...	For another $25, we splurged for the larger room when we checked in. We dropped our things and went to eat/shop. After a long walk and fighting the crowds on Michigan Ave., we returned to the room just wanting to nap. No kids for the weekend, so just pure quiet and personal freedom. Unfortunately, when we returned to the room, it stank of cigarette smoke. I pushed the call button for the front desk, no answer. I called again, impatient because of the exhaustion, no answer. The third time was answered after a number of rings. I explained to the individual that the room smelled like smoke and that it was pretty nauseating. She told me to hold while she transferred me to the front desk--I must have rolled to another department. After explaining the predicament again, the front desk asked what they could do. Not wanting to be a burden, I asked for air freshener. They said they would send someone up. About 15 minutes later, the smoke and the waiting was too much, so I called again and asked for another room. They didn't have anything available until possibly 4, so they suggested we wait 2 hours until a room opened up. We couldn't bear the room, so we sat in the lobby on &quot;grandma's couch&quot; for about 30 minutes before realizing we wouldn't find any comfort there. We walked out of the hotel and saw a Bentley out front. It occurred to me perhaps why we were seemingly being ignored by the hotel. We gave the desk a cell # before we left and actually believed they would call it. But after miserably propping our heads up on a bar until 4, we still hadn't heard from them. There didn't seem to be much interest in making things right. When we returned to the front desk, they apparently had a room available but had not called us (no surprise). It was smaller than the previous room (though must have still been worth the extra $25 since it was never refunded). We could hear people in the next room, but they weren't very loud, so it wasn't an issue. Primarily where the hotel erred was on the most basic elements--the things you take for granted. The things you would expect even from a Motel 6. The Homewood Suites we stayed at a few months before wasn't as fancy, but it was much more reliable."
23,252,"Sep 25 2009 	A great hotel in a great city	We could not have had a better time at the Drake. It is obvious that we were in one of the recently refurbished rooms because it was perfect in every way. The room looked out onto Lake Shore Drive and the lake. An unexpected bonus was being able to watch the professional volleyball tournament being played on the beach. We have stayed at the Drake several times in the past and have always gotten great service. This stay was no different. From the bellman to the concierge to the doorman to the front desk staff to the waiters in the restaurants, the service could not have been better. The Coq d'Or is one of my favorite bars in the world. The decor is very romantic and the bartenders are very old school and lots of fun to talk to. We also had excellent breakfasts in the Drake Brothers Restaurant and a memorable dinner in the Cape Cod Room. The bed was extremely comfortable and the shower was perfect. The bathroom was not large, but it was very well maintained. We also loved the fitness center. It was complete with cardio, weights, etc. The common areas (lobby and tea salon) are very European and some of the most beautiful in Chicago. We have previously stayed here during the Christmas season and they had a huge Christmas tree and trains running through the lobby - incredible. We are already planning a return trip next August."
24,252,"Sep 16 2009 	Huge Disappointment	I was so excited about staying at The Drake, you hear all of these wonderful things about it. The hotel itself is elegant and nice, but our overall experience there was such a disappointment and definitely not worth $300/night. Before even checking into our room, they had already charged our credit card once for the entire bill (without us even knowing). They charged us again when we checked in, and AGAIN a week later after our stay. When we first walked into our room, there was a roll out cot-that we did not request-standing in the middle of the entrance, we could barely walk around it! The room itself was tiny, old, and had a view of what looked like a dumpster. The toilet in the bathroom randomly made loud noises throughout the night. We could hear everything in the room next door to us. The hotel was &quot;booked&quot; so we couldn't change rooms even if we wanted to. I also believe that because they were full, they stuck a young couple like us in one of their shabbier rooms. There are PLENTY of other hotels in Chicago that are ten times nicer for the same price. Stay in one of them."
25,252,"Sep 14 2009 	A grand opulent hotel from the 1920s that still struts its stuff well!	My wife and I recently stayed here for two nights as the base for our first real vacation in some time. I booked our room on Priceline.com ($129), and we were given a nicely renovated room on the 7th floor (703), albeit with a fire escape/city view down to N. Michigan Ave. below. The room itself, however, was quite large and luxurious, with a wonderful bed and bedding, luxury toiletries in the bath, and very nice decor. However, the real attraction here is the hotel's public spaces, from the well-attended curbside reception area to the opulent lobby and Palm Court mixed use up a half-flight from the lobby. There are many interesting nooks and crannies in this hotel, and a very nice shopping promenade within. High Tea is served each afternoon in the Palm Court, which was delightful, and there is live music and dancing here in the evenings. A bonus, they were serving 2000 Dom Perignon by the glass in the Palm Court. Where have you ever seen this before? This is our wedding year, and we were surprised when we were presented with a complimentary chocolate torte dessert and half refill of the Dom when the staff heard this! We were made to feel quite special by all the staff, which is not at all the case in many mid-tier chain hotels. Finally, we had an excellent breakfast in the Drake's own restaurant, opulent and fairly priced. We did not have any of the ancillary charges that seem the basis for many of the preceding less-than-stellar reviews. Overall, we were simply delighted and hope to return soon to this ideally-located grand old hotel!"
26,252,"Sep 12 2009 	Fab Lake View	This place does not dissapoint, upgraded to a room with a view of the lake - amazing...Seems like there has been some refurbishment since the last time I was here...All and all - great!"
27,252,Sep 9 2009 	HMM...if I had all the money in the world	The Drake is a elegant hotel that you better bring your money too. The room we had was nice and elegant. We avoided the snacks and the mini bar since who can afford any of that. We never did eat at the Hotel since it was too price and not worth the value with so many restaurants near by. The Drake was nice to visit ONCE to say you have been but I find it hard to imagine a family staying there unless you are not concern about cost. In this economy who isn't. The location of the hotel is awesome. It is close to a lot of shopping and nightlife. Would I spend the money to go there again...NO. I will find a more modern hotel where I can lounge and enjoy a good breakfast and not just sleep there.
28,252,"Sep 8 2009 	Okay....	The hotel was nice and very elegant. We booked a room on priceline and when we got there they had no standard rooms with two beds (even though we requested) so we had to upgrade. Not a great start but okay. The room was nice and spacious, two closets and two bathrooms and two beds (couch, table, etc). The location was pretty good being at the end of the Magnificent mile. We were two short blocks from Rush street (great dining) and close to State for Shopping. We also could walk down to the river in approximately 15 minutes. The bar/lounge was extremely over priced and the atmospher was that of a cheesy cruise ship lounge. We did not spend any time there. (a tang. tonic was 18.50)!!I probably would not stay here again because you could just as easly stay in a holiday inn express with a better location and a good breakfast included. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere. Not a disappointment (exept that they didn't have a pool) but not a great review either. I would recommend staying somewhere in the loop, it's still really nice but a little bit more centralized."
29,252,"Sep 7 2009 	Never again....completely let down!!!!!!	This was my second stay at the Drake. My husband and I had such a geat experience last year that we booked it again this year (for a girls weekend). We booked a family suite through travelocity. We checked in at 8am, but were told our room was not ready, but they would call if it became available early (they never called). We stored our luggage and went about our day. We officially got our room at 3pm. We stayed in room 256. Avoid this room at all costs!!!! First, the room was musty and damp...very apparent when we entered the room. The carpet was constanty damp. There was mold on the shower curtains and the bathroom walls. The wallpaper and bed linens were stained and ripped. One of the lamps was broken. My friend got shocked when she attempted to turn it on, not reallizing it was broken. The showers never worked right. The water came out hot from the faucet and cold from the showerhead...at the same time. Housekeeping NEVER came to our room. We had to call for towels. We called for a third time (1030pm) for towels and toilet paper the night before we left...this is when they decided to clean our room. We declined b/c we were getting ready for bed d/t an early flight.The lady at the reception desk was very unfriendly ad refused to give me a receipt for the room b/c we had a zero balance and had booked through travelocity. I did call management to express my dissatisfaction with the hotel and the service. I was told that they were &quot;sorry&quot; and we got and old room. We had previously loved the Drake, but were left with such a sour taste for it. I will book somewhere else next time."
30,252,"Aug 28 2009 	Wonderful Experience	My wife and I had the pleasure of spending a Sunday night at the Drake in 08/2009. The elegance of this property is the first thing that impresses you. The Palm serves tea every afternoon which is a great bonus. Upon our arrival we were professionally greeted and offered a room upgrade to a recently remodeled suite. The room (736) was clean, spacious, and tastefully remodeled. The best attribute of this room is that if overlooked North beach and had an amazing view of lake Michigan. We will request this room on future visits to The Drake. For dinner we were able to walk to Rush street and have a nice time at the Tavern of Rush. The walk was only three blocks so it was a perfect stroll there and back. In the morning we ordered the american breakfast from room service and it was excellent! For lunch we walk on block south on Michigan avenue and had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory, which has a very nice outdoor seating area at the foot of the Hancock building. We shopped a bunch on Michigan ave and complete our stay in Chicago. We would recommend this trip to anyone for a refreshing, romantic getaway."
31,252,"Aug 25 2009 	Old School Elegance and Great Location	Visited our friends who moved to Chicago and stayed down the street from them at the Drake for the weekend. The location of the hotel is fantastic - near great shopping, the lake, and wonderful restaurants. We were able to book a great rate ($139). When we arrived early after our flight, we were allowed to check in early, but for a price (additional $25). It was worth it to unpack and regroup. We had a handicapped room, which was very spacious. The shower/tub combo was not ideal for us, and had only a hand held shower head. While the room was very elegantly appointed, it was showing signs of age - old floors and carpet, window casings, drapes, etc. The bedding and towels were nice and pretty new. The furniture was nice, and the tv was rather large and flat screened. The bar area of the Palm Court is just beautiful - had tea there on Friday afternoon, and drinks later that evening. We had only one complaint - one afternoon after a long day walking around town, we returned to our room and discovered both of our key cards would not work. We had to return to the front desk to get replacements, and it was right as most folks were checking in. All we wanted to do was get inside and relax!There are so many aspects of the Drake which reminded me of the Ritz in Paris, including the shopping areas on the ground floor. If you are wanting a new and hip hotel, this is not it. If you are traveling with children, this isn't your place either. No pool, no activities - really not a great place for kids. If you want to have a great weekend of shopping, dining and exploring Chicago with another adult, this would be a good choice."
32,252,"Aug 24 2009 	Grand and Charming you will not be disappointed. Great location and view of Lake Michigan.	We stayed at The Drake for our 5 year wedding anniversary in August 2009. The hotel is located just north of The John Hancock building on Michigan Avenue. The hotel is very grand and charming. They recently went through an extensive remodeling project and everything looks great. They even upgraded our room because of our anniversary. Our room was perfect and overlooked Lake Michigan. You can walk out the front door of The Drake and youre at Lake Michigan. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We were greeted curbside by Ben with a smile. He helped us unload our luggage and was very friendly. We used the parking garage a few doors down on Walton. It was less expensive than the hotel parking; $35 a day verses $49. The location is perfect and youre walking distance to the entire down town attractions. You can also grab the red line which is close by on Chicago Ave. The buses work out well too. We took the Michigan Ave Museum Campus Bus to Shedd Aquarium. The historic hotel is packed with stories. The book inside your room tells a lot about the hotel, especially the history. The Cape Cod Lounge is really neat because its basically the same as it was in the 1920s. The bartender was very knowledgably about the history of the Cape Cod Lounge. Ask him to look at the MM that Joe DiMaggio carved into the bar for his wife Marilyn Monroe. The Gold Coast Room and the Palms Room are very elegant. You will not be disappointed with The Drake."
33,252,"Aug 23 2009 	Typical grande dame hotel	Gracious, lovely semi-restored grand hotel in a spectacular location near where Michigan Ave becomes Lake Shore Dr. Lobby is elegant, Elevators are fast but small, and there is no indicating light to indicate which of the 6 has arrived at one's floor, until the door opens. My guest room door did not properly close and I had to pull or shove it closed. Room was spacious, and the window even opened a few inches...marvelous! The bed was wonderful, but there was a small refrigerator plopped in the room...useful , and appreciated, but rather unsightly. I*n a hotel of this caliber, it should appear to be &quot;built in&quot; rather than freestanding. Staff was pleasant and helpful for my 2 day visit."
34,252,"Aug 19 2009 	Pleasantly surprised	Just returned from a 2 1/2 day convention at The Drake &amp; was pleasantly surprised by its classic elegance. Our 6th floor room was spacious &amp; comfortable. The bathroom location provided lots of privacy. The banquet food served to several hundred of us Friday night through Sunday brunch was some of the tastiest I've enjoyed in some time. Our servers did an excellent job! The place was very quiet considering the Air &amp; Water Show was just outside. The elevators were somewhat small, but prompt. Their narrow doors weren't very forgiving if you got in their way. Built in 1930, there are lots of stairs in some areas. Expression by Lavazza on the ground level serves great Italian coffee, sandwiches &amp; ice cream Oak Street beach is a short walk away. I hope to be able to stay at the Drake again."
35,252,Aug 16 2009 	All you can expect...is there !!!	Just one word: spectacular !! The Staff: classy and serviceable. All tops !!
36,252,"Aug 13 2009 	Okay but not great.	I stayed at the Drake for 3 nights. The service was friendly, and it's not a bad locatiion, but way too salty for what you get. Actually Chicago is the &quot;second city&quot; for a reason, it just can't hold a candle to New York. One bright spot was the Rosebud Steakhouse just down the street, excellent restaurant."
37,252,"Aug 13 2009 	It's Nice and Famous and has a Fantastic location but otherwise just ok	I was excited to stay at the Drake because I'd heard so much about it. And true, it has an amazing location, and it is very nice. It's just not qutie as nice as I expected. The reservation process was annoying. First, the hotel made an error on my reservation and then the hotel did absolutely nothing to correct the mistake. Then I requested early check-in and wasn't told that I'd have to pay a $25 fee to check in at noon, and so I booked a flight to arrive at the hotel at noon, and then was told about the fee. I would have liked to have known that when I requested early check-in - just good info to be aware of, and in general, I felt that the hotel was very unresponsive to problems.My room was a bit old. It was a good sized room, although I did hear there were some tiny rooms. The bathroom had been updated, but I'm thinking it may have happened in the late 80s or early 90s. So it had granite, and was a dececnt size, but the bathtub was no nicer than any economy hotel and the flush on the toilet was on the wall and looked like a public restroom flush. The bed was qutie nice - nothing blew me away, but it was nice.No robes, no slippers. Nothing else to signify &quot;luxury hotel.&quot;Room service seemed even pricier than one could expect and mediocre. Ditto for the bar where I went to lunch one day.There is a business center, but it cost me $12 to spend 6 minutes on the computer to print 4 pages. Just ridiculous to charge that kind of money considering how much guests spend to stay and dine at the Drake. I know many hotels that aren't specifically for business travelers charge fees at the business center, but it just comes across as petty. My view of the lake and the city was phenomenal, though, and the location really is spectacular.I wouldn't recommend the Drake to a friend because I think there are better/nicer/cheaper hotels in Chicago, but if my friend was intent on staying at the Drake I certainly wouldn't discourage him/her."
38,252,"Aug 11 2009 	Faded - but great location and great value	The Drake should be a world class hotel as it has so much going for it. Location is the best in Chicago - opposite Bloomingdales, near Rush Street, overlooking the beach. It has history and a definate sense of granduer. That said, it is now looking a bit tired. The public areas are OK, but the rooms have a little wear and tear (but are still certainly very acceptable). Service is also a bit surly at times. That said the price seems to reflect this. We paid about $350 per night for a junior suite. To me this is excellent value. We tend to stay in more expensive places than the Drake - but the location and style of the Drake make it our regular stop in Chicago."
39,252,"Aug 10 2009 	Updated Elegance	The Drake is a lovely historical hotel in Chicago. Recently renovated, the hotel looks fabulous. My room was very comfortable with a great bed, a big bathroom and windows that opened allowing for some fresh air on the first nice day of spring. The staff is very professional and gracious. In the lobby, a harpist plays music in the afternoon during tea. A very nice touch for those who enjoy this type of service. There is a great coffee shop in the ground floor that I recommend for breakfast or lunch. The location is excellent as well."
40,252,"Aug 8 2009 	No service no manners no style - relying on it's history/former reputation	We arrived at midnight on Thursday (still here but only because prepaid). Bed had not been changed from previous occupant - pubic hairs etc in the bed, no top sheet. Informed front desk. Informed them again after 30 minutes and no sign of anyone. Maintenance man came to see what the problem is. Came back 10 minutes later with sheets which were in fact duvet covers. Told the duty manager the next morning. No apology, no statement of embarrassment - nothing. I would highly recommend NOT staying here."
41,252,"Aug 7 2009 	Beautiful hotel resting on its laurels	As a Hilton Gold VIP HHonors member for the past few years, I generally have been very happy with the serivice I have received from the various Hilton hotels in Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C, and San Diego. I was looking forward to staying at the Drake; we had visited the hotel in the past for dinner and drinks. Unfortunately, after my recent stay, I doubt I will go back again. We travel there at least 4 - 5 times a year, so we've stayed at several comparable hotels and know that Chicago has many other options.The Pros1. Wonderful location! You are a close walk to Mag Mile, Gold coast, and River North shopping and dining. Lincoln Park is a short (~10-15 minute $8.00 cab ride) drive away. The Oak Street Beach is within walking distance for running.2. Terrific conference/catering services: The food and service was wonderful during our meeting. The staff in catering was professional and very accomodating; this further highlighted the discrepancies in service in all other areas (please see below). I definitely would return to the Drake/recommend it to others for their meeting/catering facilities.3. Beautiful lobby, bar, and dining areas: bar/restaurant staff professional and prompt.4. Heavenly Beds and linens were extremely comfortable--some of the best hotel beds I have slept in recent memory! LaSource bath amenities also are very nice. Room was very clean, althought the carpet/upholstery was a bit worn.The Cons:1. As a Gold VIP HHonors member, I requested an upgrade. I have never had issues with this request (which is a part of being a member) at other hotels (i.e. Hilton Gaslamp San Diego, Chicago Conrad, Millenium Hilton NYC -- terrific service in this regard!). I was told that I could not be upgraded to an Executive level room because &quot;they were not available&quot; (yet other folks in our conference party who were not HHonors members did get rooms on the Executive floors). In addition, since I didn't require a complimentary breakfast, I asked (twice) if there was any way I could receive complimentary internet instead. I was told this was not possible unless I &quot;downgraded&quot; my room (which seemed unreasonable, since the room I was in was on a lower floor -- 4th floor -- with only a partial lake view but a great view of the heating vents). I was told I could speak with Hilton HHonors customer service. The customer service representative contacted the manager (Tom Thomas), but I never received the courtesy of a response. I really would have liked to opportunity to make what I thought was a small request (free internet versus an executive floor upgrade).2. Cleaning staff: On two consecutive mornings, the cleaning staff entered my room ~ 9 AM without checking to see if I was still there. Luckily, I am an early riser. 3. Front desk staff seemed professional enough but clearly not particularly warm/ amenable to moving beyond the cursory motions of helping (see above). They also made an error of charging me for a mini-bar item when I had not taken anything from it. They reluctantly removed the charge. Overall, the Drake has many great qualities. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location with wonderful facilities and a terrific catering staff. in addition, the rooms are clean and the beds are terrific. Unfortunately, the front desk staff, lack of response from the General Manager despite my attempts to contact him, and the lack of basic courtesies (as a Hilton HHonors member) left me a bit perturbed. I do hope that the Drake can rectifiy these issues. Until they do, I would look elsewhere first at other hotels in the area (i.e. Hotel Burnham or Monaco, Hotel Intercontinental Historic tower, Swissotel, Conrad)."
42,252,"Aug 5 2009 	Couldn't be Better	The Drake really has it all - you're across the street from Oak Street beach, can walk to many great rstaurants, John Hancock is 2 blocks away.Service was impeccable, room was very nice - paid extra for a Lakeview, the lobby &amp; restaurants were all so grand.Thought also quite economical - considering all you received.Look forward to staying again.It was a 10."
43,252,"Aug 4 2009 	Great Historic Hotel	A group of us stayed at the Drake Hotel over a weekend in April. It is a great historic hotel. If you stay here, you should be because you like historic hotels, not because you want ultra modern. The rooms are nicely appointed, but you can tell it is a historic hotel. The lobby is beautiful and has some interesting nooks and crannies. The breakfast brunch buffet is also very good and a decent value. The location is also great, making it an easy walk to get anywhere in the city. I would stay here again the next time I am in Chicago."
44,252,Aug 1 2009 	great historic hotel in a great location	This was a wonderful hotel! The rooms were well appointed and very comfortable! The location at the beginning of the magnificent mile was perfect. We were able to walk everywhere. This hotel was everything we hoped it to be! We ate at Gibsons and it was the best steak we ever had!!!
45,252,"Jul 21 2009 	The more you pay the less you get.	This is the &quot;fanciest&quot; hotel that I have ever stayed in and I was expecting much more. I was told that all the bathrooms had seperate tubs and showers, but when I got there, that was not the case. I paid for a king room with a small sitting area and they were not kidding when they said small. It was actually one chair and a small table in front of the window. Nothing special. The bed was the best thing about the room, but there weren't any sheets to sleep under. Just the comforter. No phonebook in the room, no pool, no free breakfast, and the prices for the mini bar were outrageous. I mean really, $3.50 for a snickers? My sister in law paid $6.00 for an individual kid size box of cereal and some milk. The self-parking was full so we had to park down the street in another parking garage which ended up being cheaper. Basically we paid for the bed and the name. When my parents went to Chicago they stayed at the Holday Inn and had better reviews. Unless you are just looking for a good nights sleep, I would not recommend this hotel for the money. Also, they did not offer us any transportation suggestions except when we asked about the red line. They told us that it was seven blocks away and gave us a map of how to get there. The Holiday Inn offered to shuttle my parents to the Navy Pier when they asked about it. One more thing, we got stuck in a room that was $188 a night with the ice maker right outside in the hallway and the rooms have metal ice buckets. Let's just say, they tend to make more noise when the ice is dropping compared to a plastic bucket."
46,252,"Jul 21 2009 	My Chicago Favorite	Grande old dame of Chicago -- my favorite hotel, lovely staff, impeccable, brilliant foodstuffs, all in all one of the best in the nation."
47,252,"Jul 20 2009 	A true classic	If you can - stay at the Drake. This place can be expensive but I got a good price and I am glad that I did. The hotel is just amazing inside. You will feel like you have walked into a different era when you enter. The rooms are smallish but normal for Chicago. The service is spectacular - this is the standard against which other hotels should be judged. Bottom line - if you can get a good price stay here. If you can't get a good price but everything in Chicago is expensive then stay here and at least enjoy the cost. If you can't stay here, then stop by and walk through the lobby so that next time you visit you will know where to stay."
48,252,"Jul 17 2009 	Classy Historic Hotel	great hotel in the North Michigan Mile area. you can walk to Navy Pier and Chicago Riverwalk (about a mile hike) and then a little further than that is Millenium Park. Bed is very comfy. Toilet is nice with super flush! Shower has good water pressure. CFL bulbs in lighting fixtures to help save energy. Concierge is very knowledgable. Very close to a local beach, about 2 blocks away."
49,252,"Jul 11 2009 	Beautiful Historic Hotel	Stayed at The Drake for 3 days in December. We got a last minute deal on the internet, an extremely decent rate considering it was Christmas time. The hotel is beautiful, particularly during the holidays. Large Christmas trees decorate the lobby and there are carrolers walking around singing. The rooms are pleasant. High ceilings, an entertainment armoir. The bathrooms are spacious and clean. The location is at the north end of Michigan Avenue - very convenient to tourists visiting for the holidays. For visitors in the summertime, the Oak Street beach is across the street."
50,252,"Jun 26 2009 	Avoid The Chicago Drake	Don't spend money at the Drake. The place is classic - but nothing remarkable. Just a rickety old building held together by the thick layers of paint. But that is not the warning - it is the staff. They will charge you (a lot) for anything they can and will not budge on anything in return. Read the other reviews here. In our case, out of ~50 persons there for a meeting (along with rented ballroom) two had reservations accidentally made for 3 days instead of two. Immediately the desk staff pointed to the fine print on the form stating it was a &quot;contract&quot; and they had to charge full day rate as an early departure fee. One person was able to get this retracted by the second day. The other was lied to by Assistant Director Tom Marshall and told nobody was given a break. Tom refused to talk to the comp'd person and threatened to call security. I'll make sure my corporation is aware of this place."
51,252,"Jun 15 2009 	Good Value - Nice Staff - Enjoyed our stay	We got a Super deal from hotwire, at first I was concerned because of the other reviews on tripadvisor, but it was a great stay. The location of the Drake is awesome if you are coming for shopping and to see the North Shore. It is a little ways from downtown, a few blocks from the red line.The first room we received had a nice view of the wall so we asked for an upgrade and got a beautiful room with a lake view for the rest of our stay. The first room had some peeling wallpaper in the bathroom and the toilet was in a strange location, plus the air conditioner popped and banged. Overall the first room was a nice size, not small.The second room with the lake view was nice and quiet and LARGE. The bed was large and soft. The pillows were really nice as well. It came with a coffee maker, full sized ironing board and iron along with a hair dryer and a safe. I have to say that they must put 90% of their attention and money into the lobby, because it is beautiful, but the rooms really arent as regal as youd think they might be. Dont get me wrong, they were nice, but if they were as nice as the lobby, I would give this hotel 7 stars. It appeared that the guest rooms were sort of an afterthought.The desk staff was nice and accommodating.If we hadnt received a screaming deal from hotwire, Im not sure it would be worth the standard rate."
52,252,"Jun 8 2009 	Rooms need updating big time	Definitely a Chicago classic with arguably one of the best locations in the city. We came in for a wedding, rates were still about $250 a night with group discount. I hadn't been here since my H.S. Prom in 1990. The lobby and common areas are still elegant, and classic. Staff is efficient and professional.Room was really dirty, dumpy, and needed updating big time. Carpet was seriously 40 years old and needed to be replaced. Bed was OK, TV was an old POS. I really expected more, but I was willing to sacrifice for the rest of the place.The wedding was great, can't remember which room, but it was awesome. Food was good and the service was stellar. If you're thinking about having a wedding here your guests will not be disappointed!"
53,252,"May 23 2009 	A truly classic hotel with very helpful and friendly staff	Given The Drake's reputation and having read some reviews on this site, we were unsure whether we should be excited or not. We were bowled over with the quality of the hotel, the helpful staff and the tastefully decorated room. We have stayed in many places in many countries and would rate The Drake as one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had."
54,252,"May 17 2009 	Disappointing	I was so excited when i knew that our bid landed on The Drake. My expectations went through the roof given its reputation. When we first arrived, I was impressed with the nice lobby and grande ambiance in the lounge. But once we stepped inside the rooms, our feelings turned into disappointment. The room was very small. The twin beds were comfortable but also very small. The bathroom was outdated. Cleanliness level was subpar. The minibar was dirty. No wireless connection in rooms!! Given its pricey rooms, one would expect more of this hotel. I had to extend my trip in Chicago but looked for another hotel to stay in."
55,252,"May 5 2009 	worst hotel service	My husband and I dined in their cocktail room, Coq d'Or. Beware of the bar tender, he will slip in more drinks in the check without you noticed and the manager just think you are an idiot and lied to your face."
56,252,May 1 2009 	What a treasure	We so enjoyed our trip to Chicago and the Drake - everything is just beautiful - it's lavish lobby and cozy rooms - the bar and tea time are wonderful as well. The Drake is truly a gem to the Chicago area and I recommed it to all guests who can afford to stay there. It's not cheap - but it is memorable!
57,252,"Apr 18 2009 	Great Deals right now	I am a suburban Chicago resident and had a last minute invite to a conference at the Drake. Since we were meeting for early breakfast, we decided to come down the afternoon before and live it up a bit.The hotel did not dissappoint, but i was upgraded upon arrival to the 6th floor. Our room was very nice in all respects, but I did hear other attendees complaining of room size. I didn't have the heart to tell them my internet rate was better than the attendee rate, but that is the nature of last minute booking- sometimes you win and sometimes you sleep in the car!I enjoyed the decor, the staff and the check in/out. Some hotels are operating on such skinny staffs that it is noticeable. This property had good staffing for the guests and even better for the conference services.My only heartburn came from something the Drake has no control over- our mayors &quot;revenue eyes&quot; with regards to fleecing the tourists. I would happily make 1-2 more overnight trips to Chicago every year, and actually buy something on the Mag mile if the tax add ons didn't make me so foul mooded and ornery. Mayors office, are you listening???? Olympic organizing committee, are you???"
58,252,"Apr 10 2009 	favorite hotel in chicago	This hotel is fantastic! Close to everything, beautiful. Attentive staff. Rooms well appointed, and prices very reasonable."
59,252,"Apr 8 2009 	Fulfilled a dream but at what a price!	My first trip to the Drake was 32 years ago when a college friend and her boyfriend picked me up in his Rolls and took me to the Drake for Sunday brunch. I was wowed then and I told myself that some day I would stay at the Drake. I have made many trips to Chicago over the past 32 years, but somehow, never stayed at the Drake. One of my professional societies had its annual meeting in Chicago this past week so I decided that this would be the time to do it. The location is in my favorite part of Chicago. Excellent shopping is at your doorstep. On the downside, it is pretty far away from McCormick Place. Even with the express bus lanes, you had to count on a minimum of half an hour travel time to the conference. I had requested a king sized bed and got it. The bed was really very comfortable. There were extra pillows in the closet along with a blanket that was useful. The room was extremely warm when we arrived. When we activated the ventilation system, it turned the air conditioning on and it stayed on the entire time we were there. We were comfortable, but it made us question what was going on to make the place so hot? Our room was on the 4th floor on the Michigan Avenue side and we did not experience any problems with noise. The blackout shades did an excellent job of darkening the room as well as keeping it quiet. The staff are absolutely outstanding. They really bent over backwards to help us. We did do the high tea on a Sunday afternoon, meeting some British friends of ours who had been relocated to Chicago. They brought their infant twin girls along since we had not seen them. The staff were incredibly accommodating about finding us a place where we could park the monster stroller and providing high chairs, and then taking pictures. Their willingness to help really helped me when I paid the bill for tea, scones, little sandwiches, and some sweets--$150 including tip. So I check &quot;having high tea at the Drake&quot; off my list of things to do before I die. The thing that really irritated me the most was the incredibly poor internet service. No wireless internet service was available in the rooms. The land line service was incredibly expensive and incredibly poor! It had intermittent failures every hour for five to ten minutes where it could not connect. And then suddenly, it would reconnect. I could never get a satisfactory answer for why this occurred. It was maddening because I spent more in my four days at the Drake than what I spend in a month at home on my high speed internet connection. They are not oriented to business travelers who want to work from their room.The Drake is an institution. As our British friends mentioned, this was the place that the Royal family stayed when they visited Chicago. I put it in the same category as the Plaza in New York as it once was. It is an experience to have had but not necessarily a habit to acquire. I look fondly on the experience, but the next time I am in Chicago, I will find one of the better value hotels."
60,252,"Mar 28 2009 	The Drake: Fading Beauty	I have stayed at the Drake 5 times in the past 3 years. Typically using Hilton Points, I'm a platinum member. The rooms have varied tremendously, from tiny boxes to beautiful suites overlooking Lake Michigan. This last stay they put me on 2nd Floor &quot;overlooking Michigan Ave&quot;. In reality I could hear the traffic from Michigan Ave all night. If you are a light sleeper forget it.ROOMIn serious need of upgrading. Old carpeting, small bathrooms, and tiny TV. Desk work area was very small.LOCATIONThe location at end of Michigan Ave is nice. Easy walk for good shopping and access to run path along the lake.EXTRASThe executive lounge has gone done in terms of food offerings as well as quality of food. On a Saturday morning only two newspapers for room of about 20 guests. No newspaper delivered to room. The fruit bowls they had by elevators on each floor are a thing of the past. Overall, it's a nice hotel, but definitely has seen better days. If money s not an object, then Park Hyatt or Peninsula are much better choices.Using Hilton points consider the Conrad Hotel"
61,252,"Mar 19 2009 	Grande Dame of Chicago Hotels	My daughter and I spend 2 days at the Drake in Chicago. What a fantastic hotel. I was surprised when it came up on the bidding site particularly at the rate I bid. Check the bidding for travel sites for more info. Arrived and parked across just across Michigan Ave, for $27 for 24 hours, and checked in, hotel valet is very expensive as is standard at this level hotel in Chicago. The self park is $35. Go across the street Front desk staff moved us into a two twin bed room on a refurbished floor and were generally friendly and helpful. The lobby is phenomenal, a piece of another age. The room was more pedestrian, It faced Walton Pl and was on the small side, not tiny, just small. We had a huge flat panel tv and an internet connection ($12.95/day) but there is wireless from somewhere else for $9.95 a day if you are a cheapskate. Beds were comfy, and the bathroom small but the shower was divine! Just the ticket after a long cold walk on Michigan ave. We did not eat at the hotel, as there are many options close up on Rush and State streets. Great place for breakfast is the Original Pancake House. Bell staff kept our bags efficiently after we checked out. Overall a great stay at a great hotel."
62,252,"Mar 19 2009 	Could've been okay but turned out terribly.	I'll start with the good things: The bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean. The bathtub was outdated, but large. The lobby was beautiful, and the bar was good.And now the bad: The room was a shoebox, and based on the floorplan stuck to the bathroom wall (fire routes), it was easy to see we had the smallest room on the floor. We asked for 1 King bed, and got 1 Queen bed. The bed had only a fitted sheet and a duvet - no top sheet, no blanket. Fortunately, we managed to find a bag in the closet containing the missing sheet and blanket. Unfortunately, we really didn't need it, as the thermostat seemed to be broken and the room was sweltering all night. After supposedly having it fixed for our second night, I once again woke up in the middle of the night and had to go sit in the hallway to cool down. We also requested early check-in if available, and while I didn't mind the $25 fee for this, it would have been nice to know in advanced when I requested it instead of being notified upon check-in."
63,252,"Mar 4 2009 	Grand and elegant old hotel	I am in Chicago frequently and generally stay at the Drake even though my meetings are in other hotels scattered around the downtown. I have been staying at the Drake for longer than I care to remember. I will keep coming back as long as they continue to maintain this elegant grande lady. The staff is tops, the place is clean, and it has some elegant history. Sure the Fairmont is nicer, but sterile with little history. Just take a few minutes to wander around late at night and you can just feel the stories oooz out of the walls. I just like to sit in the lobby for a few minutes before heading to the airport...it is so quiet and elegant. I hope the managers keep their careful eyes on this hotel as I would hate to have to give it up. Just one minor issue...the internet is expensive and slow for business purposes..and not wireless."
64,252,"Feb 24 2009 	Definitely a mixed bag.	My wife and I stayed at the Drake over a weekend in February. There were some very good aspects, and some very disappointing ones.First, the good ones:-We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking Lake Michigan. It was a beautiful view!-The room was large and nicely furnished. -The Drake Brothers restaurant was excellent for breakfast - great food and great service. And we got a $30 per person voucher for being Diamond members. (Yes, you do need the whole $30 each!)-The location of the hotel is great. In addition to the view, you can easily walk to many shops and restaurants. You don't need a car to experience this part of Chicago. We took a cab from the airport ($25). After our two days at the Drake, we simply walked across the street to the Hertz location at the Westin and rented a car for the rest of our trip. That allowed us to avoid the $50 per day parking fee.-There are several great shops in the hotel. The Mangel Florist shop provided a small bouqet of beautiful red roses for only $25. There was an art gallery with beautiful paintings and a very freindly owner. Don't miss the Lavazza Coffee Shop in the shopping area of the hotel - great coffee, super friendly service (translated: not snooty - see below), awesome sandwiches, and a relaxing atmosphere.And now the disappointments:-The executive lounge is closed until &quot;late March&quot; due to &quot;lack of business&quot;. So definitely don't pay extra for a room on the executive floor hoping to use the lounge. As noted above, the substitute breakfast vouchers work well for breakfast. But check your bill - we were charged for breakfast the first day.-The lobby area is undergoing renovations and much of it is covered with scaffolding and giant sheets of plastic. I notice that's disclosed on their website now, but wasn't when I made my reservation.-The Palm Court Lounge was a disappointment on Saturday afternoon. We did not feel welcome at all and the staff was quite snooty. We got up and left and had a wonderful time in the Lavazza Coffee Shop. I'd recommend the same choice for others.-Check your bill closely. We were charged for breakfast one day when it should have been free, and were also charged for some mini-bar items. And that was before I even realized there was a mini bar.-The bathroom was small and in need of updating. I guess at the end of the day, an old hotel is still an old hotel.While I'm glad we had the experience of staying in this landmark hotel, we probably won't be back."
65,252,"Feb 9 2009 	Loved it! I need to come back!	Stayed at The Drake at the end of a business trip. It was fantastic! Located in downtown Chicago just 1 block away from the John Hancock Building next to Lake Michigan. You could see the beauty of the hotel even though a large part of it was being restored to it's 1920s glory. The staff were extremely friendly, knowledgeable &amp; nice. The rooms were fantastic &amp; beautiful! A regular room is like a mini suite! The bed was comfortable too. I need to come back here once the hotel is completely restored. I would recommend it to anyone."
66,252,"Jan 28 2009 	The Drake Luxury/Service	Stayed at the Drake just for the weekend for a quick getaway in Chicago knowing that the weather would be horrible (snow &amp; cold).Check in went great. Due to low occupancy, front desk gave us a free ugprade to the executive level. Normally this gives you access to the executive lounge for cocktails and breakfast, however due to the low occupancy rate, the lounge was closed. I did ask if there was anything else we could get instead and the front desk gladly gave us two free breakfasts at Drake Brothers. Pretty good deal so far!Room was great. Very large with four closets! We couldn't remember where we put everything we brought. All the restaurants at the Drake are very nice. Cape Cod Room is our favorite for seafood. Drake Brothers is a steakhouse, however, they do have a very nice breakfast buffet. Coq D'Or is their small lounge/restaurant where we had lunch. It was very good also. The Palm Court is their other &quot;bar&quot; however is also the tea room. They have afternoon tea while a harp plays. It is always very crowded. We went in the evening where they have jazz and it had loads of dancers and was quite crowded also. That evening we decided to try the new Trader Vics which has just opened up after being closed for two years, prior at the Palmer House Hotel. It is just a three block walk from the Drake by Rush St. It was pretty good, however, service was spotty and the food was just so-so. That being said they have a great lounge serving fabulous Mai-Tai's so it is good for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres for sure!We have stayed at the Drake previously and always love their ambiance and great service along with excellent gold coast location. I would recommend it to all looking for an upscale lodging offering good restaurants and service."
67,252,"Jan 25 2009 	Still a classy place to stay!	Booked our stay at the Drake on Hotwire, so I didn't know we were staying here until after I'd paid (got an excellent deal, though - over 60% off the going discount rate). I was a bit skeptical about it after reading through the reviews, but thanks to you all, knew the potential pitfalls.When we checked in, I asked for a room on a renovated floor. The clerk asked me if I wanted one bed or two, and I asked for one. As she's figuring out which room to put us in, she says, &quot;Oh, well, you're not only getting a renovated room, you'll be the first people to stay in it.&quot; We also got upgraded to a lake view room. No complaints there! The front desk staff was very polite on the several occasions we visited them.As stated in a lot of the other reviews, the concierge staff was extremely helpful as well. They booked our dinner reservation as well as helping us get two spa appointments at the same time on a Saturday morning with only a couple hour's notice! My only complaint is about the parking - it's valet-only, and it's expensive. Just be aware of that if you're driving in. We stayed for one night, and the parking charge was $48! Your best bet would be to find a self-park garage in the area - realistically, you shouldn't pay more than $30 per day to park, so at the very least, you're saving almost $20, if not more. Still, it's a great location, right on Michigan Avenue, near all the shopping, you're within walking distance of the Rush St. nightlife, and when the weather's nice, you're right across the street from the beach and the lakeshore. Definitely glad we stayed here. Would stay here again!"
68,252,"Jan 22 2009	A Great Experience	We stayed here over the New Year period 2008/9 and experienced their New Year Ball, a lovely black tie event. The hotel service was excellent and the elegance and age was just what we hoped for. Its location is also superb for a stay in the city. We walked everywhere and no walk was too long.Our room faced the front (South) which was fine if uninspiring though the rooms facing North offer spectacular views of the 'coast'. I found the hotels bar ordinary and expensive, there are better ones just around the corner! Try the 'Grill on The Alley' for a great meal and a wonderful bar.I believe there is a major refurb planned for Feb 2009."
69,252,"Jan 8 2009	Grand Old Hotel	The Drake is realy one of those timeless hotels. Even though it is dated in age, and now one of those chanes that tend to strip all personality from a hotel, The Drake Stands out. Its location is superb, right at the tip of lake michigan, and Michigan Ave. The food is great, somewhat pricy but the Cape cod room is worth it. The atmousphere is splendid. It was the first time I took my now fiance home from Ireland, and it was perfect. I can not compliment them more on the quality. I am in the hotel industry and I tend to be picky. I don't think this quite makes one of 'The worlds top' type hotels, but as far as a not about to spend a grand a night hotel, it is top of the league."
70,252,"Jan 8 2009 	Fabulous Drake!	Lavish, but not overdone, this hotel makes the average person feel like a member of royalty, if only for the night. Wide hallways and rich, elegant dcor add to the charm and old world luxuriousness of this grand old hotel. Great dining and even good shopping choices make this one of Chicagos most elegant palaces. Ive stayed at the Palmer House and the Ritz Carlton. Both are great but The Drake tops them hands down."
71,252,"Dec 28 2008 	It pains me to write this review	We don't usually stay in the Gold Coast area when we are in Chicago and it has been many years since I have been to the Drake to stay. I had such fond memories and I guess I should have kept it that way. The hotel still has bits of its former glory that you can see through the slow decay. All the beautiful crown molding is still there and the lobby is as impressive as ever, the rooms are where the age becomes evident. Hilton has done work to the hotel and continues to do so but they are not going to win the battle with out a major overhaul. Our room was a Gold coast suite with 2 rooms, the average nightly cost for this room is $1,100. Amenities in that room include quite a few things we never had, some simple some pretty major; no bolster pillow, no complimentary beverage, no large arm chair with Ottoman, no turndown service at night, and no newspaper. There is a work area in the suites as well, however there are no light bulbs anywhere in the rooms over 60 watts so its hard to read anything. The hotel was also noisy, the doors are heavy and close hard so every time someone came or left we heard doors slamming. The staff used to be very accommodating but now they are all rather aloof with the exceptions of the maids that stand and chat in the hallways, they always said hello. Our suite had a bathroom with decor out of the 80s and shower mold that appears to have started in the 90s it was so thick. There was also a pop spill all down the wall by our mini fridge that was there when we checked in and was not cleaned up during our whole week stay. The bedroom of the suite and the bathroom also had the distinct smell of vomit which made me have to go buy a strong candle to keep in the room. I was so very disappointed, we will not be back to stay in the hotel again. I would recommend the restaurants however, they are wonderful."
72,252,Dec 10 2008 	Better than expected given reviews	I was looking to stay here on pleasure but thought I'd wait till experiencing on business given the relatively lower rating given the reputation of the hotel. I must say at Christmas time the hotel is beautifully decorated and majestic. The rooms are a bit outdated but it's a historic hotel. Carpet a bit dungy is my only complaint. Bedding and comfort are top notch. Service I find very good. I'd search for internet discount rate as this hotel is only worth 175 a night tops compared to what you'd find at Sofitel or Affinia for comparison of updated room and arguably better or same service.
73,252,"Dec 8 2008 	Refurbished perfection	My latest visit to this grande dame hotel allowed me to see first hand how the renovations are coming along. I had a junior suite on one of the revovated floors, and the results are fabulous. Everything brand new, but the old flavor of the hotel still remains. Our room had two very large flat screen tv's, great bath, completely restored woodwork detailing, and a tremendous view of Lake Michigan. All of the old details of the hotel were perfectly restored, allowing none of the old character to be lost. I do not know why anybody would stay any place else other than this place. The Palm Court was absolutely hopping on the weekend with great jazz music and dancing, and the timeless feel and elegance are just so palpable.They are redoing one floor at a time, so make sure you ask for a room on one of the renovated ones."
74,252,"Dec 4 2008 	Never again	First, the hotel gladly booked my room at a discounted rate and billed my credit card for 100% of the stay prior to our arrival. Btw, our discounted rate was $325 per night! I now know why they do this. When you arrive and chose to leave due to problems you lose all of your money. Their rate of early departures has to be very high given all the problems we experienced. What problems, you may ask? Our bathroom had black mold on the ceiling. The ceiling in the main room was cracked from the ceiling light fixture all the back to the frame of the wall/ceiling. Every time we open or shut the door to our room, plaster fell on our bed. The carpet was GROSS to the point that we asked for another room due to the mold smell. We were refused another room. There were no coffee mugs. I called at 8AM for a mug and it did not arrive til afternoon (the handle was broken). At 8PM I asked for a CLEAN robe to no avail. I called the front desk at midnight to advise that I had yet to receive a clean robe. Boy they were quick! They brought a roll away bed. HUH!? We were in the gym and asked for extra head sets since there were none on the rack. Again, to no avail. They later explained that they no longer provide head sets due to sanitary concerns. Gee, if they applied the same concern toward their hotel rooms they would not have a black mold problem. If you want to eat breakfast via room service be prepared to wait all morning. We placed our breakfast order for early delivery (7AM). When it finally arrived at 8:30 AM nothing on our plates resembled anything we had ordered. Two bagels on a plate and a bowl of fruit...? Huh!? We spoke with the weekend general manager who stated that there was nothing he could do to adjust our bill because we had pre-paid. He gave us four complimentary meal vouchers good for use in their fine dining facility. This was on our last day! What were we going to do with complementary meal vouchers on our last day. They are invalid the day you depart. If you valet your car they tell you to call 15-20 minutes prior to pick up in the event they are busy. They were! We waited 45 minutes and barely caught our flight out of Chicago. For all those folks who rated this hotel a &quot;5&quot; , I can only assume you are accustomed to staying at 2 star hotels. The hotel is filthy and is in need of a MAJOR face lift. Also, I am fluent in spanish while teaching foreign languages for 30 years, and I still had a difficult time communicating with their spanish speaking staff."
75,252,"Nov 28 2008 	Finally got there!	Stayed at the Drake during the first week in November, in fact arrived Chicago just a day too late to celebrate Obama's victory. I once worked in Chicago and have been back a few times, but somehow never got to stay in this wonderful, timeless landmark - until the opportunity presented itself to whisk my partner away for 5 days. It did not disappoint. The junior lakeview suite was spacious, classy, comfortable and well equipped - the bed was to die for (the &quot;HH Collection&quot; topper, douvet and Egyptian cotton sheets now rival Sofitel's in my opinion). Heating was a little on the low/uncontrollable side and the bath and bathroom incredibly small for a suite. And forget watching TV from the bed - you will need the eyes of an eagle until the Drake goes widescreen!Although the dcor looked just a little tired, this hotel has class, real class. Chicago's [great] answer to the London Savoy or the Ritz or indeed the Chicago Ritz. Our only complaint was that front desk and bar staff were OK, just OK. This is where the Drake lost one star for us. Concierge and bell team were however humorous, helpful and very prompt. .The Drake is still steeped in nostalgia and stories (where else can you rest your cocktail where Joe DiMaggio carved Marilyn Monroe's initials on the bar). So I reckon this hotel is still the only place to end up after lugging your Saks and Bloomie's shopping bags down the Magnificent Mile!"
76,252,"Nov 23 2008 	Nostalgic Hotel	The Drake is a nostalgic hotel located just a block from the Water Tower. The lobby is beautiful and continues to hold the grace of which has made it famous. There are breathtaking views of Lake Michigan and a myriad of upscale boutiques. The hotel Christmas tree was erected in the middle of the lobby during my stay and was absolutely gorgeous, surrounded by animated Santa's and angels flying overhead. During lunch in the Palm Court restaurant, a harpist played adding a bit of magic to the overall ambiance. Overall, the rooms were nice and clean. One bit of information for Hilton Honors guests that difers from other HIlton properties is that you must be booked in an executive suite in order to be allowed onto the concierge level- no matter if you are Diamond VP or not. Although it did not impact my stay, I found it interesting. Overall a great stay."
77,252,"Nov 4 2008 	Family time at the Drake	We checked in at around noon on a Sunday and our room was not available( it was 1 queen and two Murphy twin beds) I asked the women at check in if she could find us another room since we were only in Chicago for 24 hours and we had touring plans and wanted to get into a room. They put us into an upgraded room/suite with two queen beds and a sleeper sofa and two bathrooms for the same price. It was wonderful! Decore is a bit dated but very clean and old-world elegant. The Concierge was wonderful. She recommeneded a wonderful Architectural boat cruise( very worthwhile) and an amazing Itialian restaurant (Volare') a few blocks off of Michigan Ave. Overall our stay was memorable. However, we found it rediculous and even hard to believe that we could not get wirleless access for our laptop at the Drake w/out paying a fee even in the public areas. Two and three star hotels offer it for free. The Drake is a slpurge( if not on a business account) and extra fees are insulting.The other thing that was not favoraable was that the heat in our room could not be regulated and we roasted all night....very uncomfortable and a total waste of energy and money by the hotel."
78,252,"Oct 28 2008 	The Drake: ""Classy Chicago""	I have just returned from The Drake. I stayed there for a wedding this past weekend. I loved this hotel. Very elegant. Just walking through the lobby is amazing. Hotel has a wonderful charm. Service was excellent. Staff very helpful. It is in great location.Plenty of restaurants..A harpist plays during the tea hour near the lobby.Just an amazing hotel. Best wishes....MaryRichmond, VAAt Drake hotel 10-24-10-26 2008"
79,252,"Oct 20 2008 	Classic Chicago	The Drake is a classic Chicago hotel. Best location on Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Ave, this hotel has it all. The hotel has never been ruined with some sort of modern update. Has a classic and logical feel with great rooms and character.The lobby is wonderful and drinks by the fountain are a must for an elegant experience at this classic hotel."
80,252,"Oct 20 2008 	Classic but needs an update	I stayed at the Drake recently because it was very close to a customer account. I have heard great things about the Drake in the past, and the fact that it was priced within my company's frugal allowance sealed the deal. I arrived late at night, but the lobby was very elegant and well appointed. Check-in was a breeze, and I board the old elevator to my 3rd floor room. Upon walking in, two things crossed my mind: it was a generously sized room and I have not seen a 19 inch TV outside of a yard sale in some time.The details are rough around the edges. Wallpaper was peeling, paint was chipped, tile grout was loose, sink stopper floating around. The bed was new, and the shower was a big walk-in type. The Drake Bros restaurant serves breakfast, and my Hilton Gold membership comped the normally $24.95 buffet. It was good, but not $25 good! I find that these things are overpriced to begin with, and downtown Chicago is obviously no exception. Overall, it's a decent hotel for what my company paid. There are better hotels in the area for only slightly more money, however."
81,252,"Oct 12 2008 	Time for a renovation	While the Drake is an classic old hotel, it is long past it's prime. The lobby is still very elegant, but the rooms are long in need of renovation, routine maintenance has been deferred too long. Old carpets with stains, peeling wall paper, dirty windows. Great location. I have stayed here twice for business meetings, our group is not coming back. They seem to have problems getting people the rooms they had booked."
82,252,"Oct 9 2008 	Save your money	We found The Drake Hotel a huge disappointment. We reserved the executive floor. We were given another. After going back down to the desk...they gave us our reserved room. It was very noisy, inside and out. Our second night we had to call down and ask for shampoo and soap. The next morning we had to call down and ask for coffee cups which were there for us the first night. We waited 45 minutes for the cups. Actually, the housekeepers wanted to clean our room and we told them that we were not ready and were still waiting for our cups. They brought them within a couple of minutes. Twenty minutes later as we were leaving, the coffee cups became available from another unit of the hotel. The bed was nice but there was no sheet between the comforter. We found this odd as others have shown. The staff at the downstairs bar seemed extremely rude. We will not be going back to The Drake. There are too many other Grand Hotels in Chicago."
83,252,"Oct 8 2008 	A Wonderful Experience	I have had the good fortune to stay at the Drake each of the last three years, and I've had excellent experiences each time. The common areas of the hotel are wonderful. The furnishings and decor make you feel as though you could be sitting in the lobby a century ago. It's great to have tea or appetizers in the bar and just watch people come and go. There are several dining options, and though I've heard that Drake Brothers is great for dinner, I've only ever eaten breakfast there. The breakfast is wonderful, though - you can have the buffet or ala carte. I've been to a few banquets and business meetings at the hotel as well, and the food is always better than you would expect for that kind of thing, so I think you can safely give the catering service high marks. Over the years, I've stayed in three different room types - a city view suite, a city view double and a lakeview king. The suite and king were both great. I will say that the city view double was showing its age, but I figure that is to be expected at a grand old hotel. If you want trendy, new furnishings and plasma televisions, go stay at a new hotel. If you want history, grandeur and tradition, stay here. You'll also get REMARKABLE service (which I think is the best reason to stay here). I've always had great service at check-in and check-out with both the bellhop and front desk staff, the housekeeping service is great (the room is always spotless) and the concierge can't be beat. She was able to get tickets to some very hot shows the day of and got great seats. Some folks have complained about the location - saying that it's not central enough. Admittedly, it is at the end of the magnificent mile rather than in the middle, but I think the lake view and the proximity to some of the higher-end boutiques on Oak Street are the perfect complement to the hotel. Also, some of the best restaurants (Spiaggia, etc) are within a block or two. For the overall package of location, room decor and GREAT service, I really don't think the Drake can be beat."
84,252,"Sep 29 2008 	Very Nice	My husband and I stayed at The Drake Hotel for 3 nights in September. It was the best time to see Chicago because the crowds were minimal. As for the hotel ...... it is super fancy and the decor is AMAZING! They had fresh flowers in the lobby and the design was fantastic. The staff were extremely professional and approachable (not like in Ontario). The only things that we were not impressed about were the extra charges. If you want to use the fitness center (and it is tiny), there is a fee for it. The internet must be 'bought' even if you bring your own laptop. With the amount of money that we paid (or would have paid if we didnt use hotwire.com), you would think they would include the above items at no extra charge. But....overall it was a very nice stay. I would not pay the $390 that the room was advertised for, but if I could get another deal, I would stay there again."
85,252,"Sep 22 2008 	another disappointing stay at the Drake	I wanted to like the hotel, but the condition of the room doesn't match the cost of staying here. Sofa had holes, lampshade had burn marks, torn wallpaper, worn carpet. unfriendly and uncooperative and unprofessional appearance from the staff. would not even consider a late check out. the bathroom was not clean when we checked in. and during our visit the bathroom was not clean."
86,252,"Sep 21 2008 	Uninspriring view from window but what a bed! :D	I was in Chicago on business so had to book a hotel that was on the approved list. I was advised to book The Drake by a colleague - the tripadvisor reviews were largely good so I wasn't too bothered.My room was a good size but there was no upgrade to a suite (oh well).My only negative comments would be that the room is fairly dark even with all curtains open during the day or all lights on at night, the wardrobe is quite small and I did notice noise from the room next door (talking on telephone, alarm clock in the moring, etc).On the plus side the bed has got to be the best I have ever slept in and was so comfortable. The coffee machine in the room makes very acceptable coffee and the shower worked fine.Old fashioned decor was not to my taste but was in good order.Good location and I even had oblique views of the lake from my room!"
87,252,"Sep 19 2008	Interesting hotel lack of attention to detail	This hotel was booked by Hilton Honors. I am a Diamond Member. The lakeview room with twin beds and sitting area was delivered as promised. It was a nice room with excellent view. Good location adjacent to the Magnificent Mile and not too far from Navy Pier.The hotel clerk booking us in appeared not to understand the reservation which, for some reason, was made for two nights on separate certificates. This was subsequently confirmed when I received a whopping bill after my first night's stay. This was reviewed by the hotel desk and I was assured that charges had been reversed and balance was &quot;0&quot;. On checkout the following day I again asked and was assured there were no charges. I today discovered the charges on my credit card. The Drake promised to remove them but it would take a week. They could not print out a receipt on checkout as I had &quot;0&quot; charges. Newspaper was not delivered to room in morning. The Executive lounge requires agility to climb approximately 25 stairs. When I asked about disabled guests I was informed by a staff member that he had asked the same thing when he arrived at the hotel. No real answerThis hotel is expensive and has magnificent lobby, elevators and good rooms. However, it lacks enthusiasm towards guests and does not seem to care if you are pleased or rankled. I liked the location but not the attitude. I would not stay here if I had to pay $375 a night."
88,252,"Sep 4 2008 	Gorgeous hotel - great rates available if you look in the right place	We booked this on Hotwire and what a pleasant surprise. In the middle of summer we got a room for $99 and then when we arrived at about 2pm on the day of check-in we were given a free upgrade and ended up in a suite with two queen beds and two bathrooms, a sofa and armchairs and two tvs - it was HUGE!We really got to enjoy being in the city centre and at the head of the Magnificent Mile. The people at the hotel booked us onto an architecture/sightseeing cruise the next day and we really had a wonderful stay in the city thanks to the Drake.This hotel is highly recommended and the location is perfect. The staff were all courteous and there is loads of history to read about connected to the Drake.If you get a good deal on this place it is a real treat!"
89,252,"Aug 28 2008 	Beautiful Hotel convenient location	The Drake Hotel is an excellent choice for anyone interested in staying along the 'Magnificent Mile'. We arrived at the hotel about 8am and were very pleased when we were upgraded to a jr. suite and immediately given our room keys. Our room was very large and very beautifully decorated. The hotel is convenient to all of the best shopping as well as the Oak Street Beach area, which was fun to visit as well. My only 'complaint' was that there was no where particularly close to walk to and grab a cup of coffee, but this was a small price to pay for such a beautiful hotel and location.I would definitely recommend this hotel."
90,252,"Aug 26 2008 	Disappointing	Last month 2 high school friends and I met in Chicago for a brief mini reunion. We arrived before the 3:00 check-in time and were told our room wasn't ready yet but would be soon. We waited and waited, and still our room wasn't ready. After an hour, I requested that the hotel treat us to tea while we waited. We were told we could have cups of tea (no extras). Finally at 4:30 we were given keys to our room and told that our bags had been sent up. We went up to the room only to discover that our keys did not work. When we returned to the desk, the woman said one of our cell phones had probably demagnetized the keys. The keys had never been near our cell phones. We went back up to our room and discovered our bags had not been sent up, and we had to call to have them sent up. That night I called to check that I could get my car at 6:00 the following morning. I was told to call 10-15 minutes before I needed the car. The next morning I called and no one answered, and I had to leave a voice mail. I called a little bit later and still no one answered. When I went down to get my car, it was not there, and clearly the man in charge of the cars had not received my message. I ended up leaving The Drake about 25 minutes after my intended departure. After our stay I filled out a customer survey and described the events of our stay. I've waited a month and have not heard anything back from The Drake. Admittedly no one problem was awful, but when you add them all up, it makes for less than a perfect stay. Errors happen, but a truly fine hotel apologizes and takes responsibility for their mistakes. The Drake may once have been a 4 diamond hotel, but today only their rates make you think 4 diamonds."
91,252,"Aug 25 2008 	Great Location Grand Hotel	Great location on Marvelous mile!The Drake has retained its charm and character with a recent room renovation.My room was large, recently renovated, clean, and quiet. Hallways were well lit.I didnt have any of the problems noted in some other recent reviews. I was on a non-smoking floor; the furniture and linens were obviously new."
92,252,"Aug 5 2008 	Perfect for a family weekend!	My husband and I brought my mom to the Drake in March of '08 to celebrate her 60th birthday. The great thing about The Drake during the winter, is you're able to get fantastic rooms for unbelievably reasonable prices. I believe our two club-level rooms overlooking Lake Michigan were less than $200 a night.The rooms were de rigeur for the Drake - well appointed and ample in size. We love staying at the Drake for the &quot;old Chicago&quot; feel we always get, but are always shocked back into Hilton reality when it comes to service. Most of the Drake employees always seem rather put out, and the biggest example was when the three of us (rather than venture out into the freezing snow) opted to have dinner and drinks in the Palm Court. Our waitress literally had a scowl on her face every time we asked her for something. I'm not a travel snob, but I'm never a fan of servers just being downright rude to people who actually, are quite nice and friendly. The tip we left reflected our dissatisfaction.But, we don't go to the Drake for the service, we go for the history and the fun and the location on Michigan Avenue."
93,252,"Jul 8 2008 	Totally deceiving	There are so many problems with this hotel it's not even funny. First, the rooms are horrendous. They're lime green with wallpaper from the 70's. Not at all what you see on the website. It's like checking into the Four Seasons and then staying in a room at the Motel 6. The room that they show on their website is one of their suites, not one of their standard rooms. Second, guest service is rude and pointless. I'm not just talking about the people behind the desk. I'm talking all across the board. The parking attendants. The restaurant servers. The managers. My wife and I couldn't believe it. For example, when we checked in, they put us in room #125. That's on the first floor on the corner of Michigan Ave. &amp; Lake Shore Drive. It is so loud! It's a room that shouldn't even be offered to guests. So we asked if we could switch rooms and instead of giving us another room, they asked if we would rather check out! I asked if the hotel was sold out that evening. They said no. Huh? So, the hotel is not sold out, you have a comparable room available, but you won't let us switch? It was only after asking for the manager, that they put us in a smoking room. And besides the horrible smell, it was just as ugly and old-looking as the first room. Very nice, people.My advice to anybody traveling to Chicago who wants to stay in a nice hotel on Michigan Ave, stay at the Park Hyatt, Marriott or Four Seasons. I've stayed at them all and The Drake doesn't even come close to comparison. Oh, and don't even get me started on the restaurant. Let's just say it's a step above McD's but will make you take out a bank loan."
94,252,"Jul 7 2008 	Perfect Weekend Getaway	We chose this hotel because there was an online special from hotels.com. What a surprise to find such a fabulous hotel with character and elegance for such a small price. Our room was on the 7th floor which we were told had been recently renovated. It was very nicely furnished and had a large flat screen television. There was a walk-in closet with a safe and thick bathrobes inside. The bathroom was spotless with marble floors and a large bath/shower. All the staff we encountered could not have been more helpful or friendly. The only thing we could possibly find fault with was the bed. It was really hard. Of course, if you like a firm mattress, that would be a plus!"
95,252,"Jul 5 2008 	Lovely hotel lots of character	Stayed here 5 nights while in town for a convention. This is a lovely old-school hotel with large guest rooms and plenty of history (see the press kit on the hotel website for a list of past guests). The decor is quite old-fashioned, as you'd expect from a place like this, but that gives it character - if you want shiny, minimalist and modern then book at one of the many chain hotels in town instead. Room was very clean and quiet, had a nice bathroom (love the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn toiletries!) and the bed was extremely comfortable, my only complaint would be the lighting (but dim lighting is fairly standard for hotels). Internet access is quite expensive but there's a cheaper weekly rate if you're staying more than a few days. Yes, the minibar is expensive, but that's to be expected in a high-end hotel - there's a 24-hour Walgreens a couple of blocks south on Michigan Ave where you can pick up snacks and drinks quite cheaply, so i didn't find this a problem. The location is excellent - near the lake, just off Michigan Ave (a block north of the Hancock building) so great for shopping, dining and sightseeing. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was really good, with an excellent selection of healthy and not-so-healthy items. I found all the staff I talked to to be friendly and very helpful. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Chicago."
96,252,"Jul 2 2008 	Amazing	I was visiting Chicago for the first time and had heard so much about the Drake hotel. I told my boyfriend that I had wanted to stay there so he surprised me and booked us a room there. I must say the service was excellent. The check in went very quickly and smoothly. The staff was very helpful and considerate. The room was large, well lit, the linens were beautiful. We ordered some room service and it was a bit pricey but very tasty. I do recommend people to stay at the Drake and enjoy the wonderful hospitality they have to offer. I would definitely go back!"
97,252,"Jun 29 2008	If you want to splurge...	What a gorgeous hotel! We love places with a story &amp; try to stay at member hotels of the Historic Hotels of America. The Drake lives up to its reputation. From the building itself, the linens, the service, to the couch in the elevator, everything was beautiful. The hotel thankfully was up to our cleanliness standards. We've found sometimes the older hotels need to be updated, but the Drake is not one of them. The only negative was the price. Our room was almost $500 per night, including taxes. If we hadn't had a free night with our Hilton reward, we would not have stayed there. Hopefully, we'll be able to stay there again."
98,252,"Jun 21 2008 	Wondreful grand dame hotel	Recently stayed at the Drake in Chicago while attending a conference. the staff from top to bottom was polite, cheerful and attentive to our needs. The room was well appointed and maintained, quiet and comfortable. The in house restaurants are pricey but comparable to others in the area. The combination of a delightful staff with this grand dame hotel made for a great stay!"
99,252,"Jun 20 2008	excellent all round loved this place	This is a lovely hotel,I was here on business, and will go again some time in the future. I was a single female alone, and nothing was too much trouble, staff were attentive and rooms were lovely and clean, well located"
100,252,"May 29 2008 	Classic Drake Experience	We had a wonderful stay at the Drake Hotel. The facility is in impeccable condition, and the service is top notch. We both agreed that the bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in! As a suggestion, park in the Drake Tower Garage to the East of the main entrance for $30/night."
101,252,"May 25 2008 	Excellent hotel	The Drake Hotel did not disappoint! We felt like home from check-in through check-out. The staff is extremely pleasant, friendly and helpful. We got a Junior Suite with a Lake view. The room was huge, well appointed and well maintained. The bathroom was really nice as well. The room was cleaned twice a day but we were never disturbed. The breakfast choices were great. And I do recommend having lunch at Coq d'Or - tasty tasty tasty food. Location is great as well. We really loved it at the Drake!"
102,252,"May 18 2008 	A Grande Dame that needs to get with the times	I stayed at the Drake last week for a conference. I went there with certain expectations, as I had stayed at a modern near-by property a few weeks earlier. Although I had confirmed by Hilton preferences in advance, the first room they tried to stick me in was on a low floor. The second room was a smoking room that was the size of a closet. The last room I finally got, was perfectly adequate, but needed some updating. The bed was not very comfortable (especially compared to the hotel down the street). The bathroom was small. The TV was old and only had a small selection of stations. I am a federal government employee and I checked in with a tax exempt form. Not only did they not know what to do with it, when they finally figured it out, I was still billed incorrectly and had to get it straightened out. (Hey, I wanted to save the taxpayers some money, but what a pain!)As for the conference facilities themselves, the rooms were tiny and hot, even though outside it was in the 60s while we were there. After the sessions ended, the wait for the elevators was ridiculous. The other ridiculous wait was for the ladies room when the sessions broke. With all the choices of hotels in Chicago, I would definitely look at other options when I return. There was nothing compelling-- the room, the staff, or the location -- that would make me want to stay there again."
103,252,"May 16 2008 	Exceptional location wonderful service!	My mother and I booked a 2 night stay at The Drake. What can I say? First off, the hotel is right off of Lake Shore Drive, conveniently off of I-55, Michigan Ave. is just blocks away, close to a wide variety of shopping and restaurants, (We ate at Mike Ditka's place only 7-8 blocks away. Wonderful food!) The check-in process was speedy and efficient, all of our requests were accomidated. The consierge desk is open until 11pm which is helpful. The only thing is self-parking is $30 per day and the valet parking is $45 per day. TAKE MY ADVICE AND JUST SHELL OUT THE EXTRA $15!! The parking garage was full before we checked in and we wasted an hour driving around downtown looking for parking. We finally just went back to the hotel and all of our luggage was brought to our room, and quite quickly might I add. The few requests that we did have (additional towels, wine glasses) were also addressed promptly. But the best part is the bathroom. SOOO spacious! Two women with their belongings strug out everywhere and still lots of space to move around. Bottom line: clean rooms, attentive staff, close to Michigan Ave., Shedd Aquarium, Contemporary Art Museum of Chicago and much, much more. LOVED THE DRAKE!!"
104,252,"May 15 2008 	Historical Chicago at its best	This is one historical hotel and a great place to stay if you want to be in the Miracle Mile. The Drake is a Chicago landmark. Our room was a handicap access room and nicely appointed (our room was on floor 1 and had two bathrooms with a large living area). This is an older property, so keep that in mind. If you want modern, this is not the place. Everything was grand, and the rooms have updated furnishings. But $20 for a nice glass of wine was hard to swallow. Not asking for a list was my mistake. But it's disappointing, and the bartender made me feel less than just another person in line for services. And $12.95 for Internet is another Hilton gouge. Don't forget to price these items in when you consider the Drake. Otherwise it was a comfortable stay at a nice, albeit &quot;historical&quot; (read &quot;old&quot;), four-star hotel. I would gladly stay there again for the historical significance, but avoid the bar and rally for fair Internet prices."
105,252,"May 9 2008 	STAY AWAY FROM SMOKING FLOORS!!	I attended a conference at The Drake and reserved my room several months prior. The hotel is beautiful but I requested a non smoking room and guaranteed my late arrival. When I got there at midnight (! travel delays) I was told there were only smoking rooms available--nothing else. I was assured I would be moved first thing in the morning. I stayed in that stinky room because it was so late and I had nowhere I could go. I woke up several times to the smell of stale smoke. All my clothes smelled and my hair smelled and I had to attend a conference! I wasn't relocated until about my 4th visit to the front desk at 3:30 the next day. The second room was beautiful and I have absolutely no complaints. However, I was not compensated for my having to stay in the smokey room and I had to pay for it when I left, even though I stated my disappointment. We'll see if I even hear from them. I will NEVER stay in a smoking room again! And for the price of the Drake, I shouldn't have to!!!"
106,252,"May 7 2008	Hot room and non-caring staff	My wife and I arrived for a getaway two-night adventure and all was OK. The bathrooms are NOT what they should be for what they are charging, but the room was clean, tidy and had some savoir faire. The room was &quot;hot&quot; tho, (about 76 degrees) and would not cool down in the approximate 45 minutes we were changing for our first night out. I called management and they said they would take care of it. When I returned at 1:30 AM after a night on the town, having had a few drinks, the room temperature was unchanged -- hot!I called and management was totally unresponsive, basically giving me the blow-off.After cleanliness, this (temperature) is the most important part of a good hotel room and cannot be compromised. For the money, stay somewhere else....like the Sofitel!"
107,252,Apr 30 2008 	Nice hotel	I stayed here for business and the hotel was just nice. I rooms were a bit old but very comfortable beds!The food is excellent and the staff is very friendly. But their interenet connects stinks.
108,252,"Apr 20 2008 	Could use a little work	I recently stayed at the Drake Hotel for a business meeting. The public areas of the hotel are absolutely beautiful. The architecture is just stunning and the floral displays are perfect. The sleeping rooms could use a litlle work though - there was paint peeling off the ceiling, the carpet was filthy. And the housekeeping wasn't the best - cobwebs in the room and hair - that wasn't mine - in the tub when I checked in. These are things I would overlook in a cheaper hotel - but with the prices you pay at The Drake, you expect it to be better."
109,252,"Apr 15 2008 	Good 20 Century experience	The location is great for a tourist/business trip. Michigan Avenue is right there. The nearest subway station is about 6/7 blocks away, but the bus runs right next to the hotel. The service is great, thou the hotel is quite old; which has it pluses and negatives. The rooms are spacious and we had a great lake view, however the decor itself is just what I would call &quot;granny like&quot;. You can tell the hotel was the &quot;it&quot; place 50 years ago, I just think it needs some bringing it to the 21 century.Room service was fairly quick.I was there because of a conference my partner was attending, but for the same money I probably would stay somewhere less &quot;old flashy&quot; and more substance, such as a place with a good gym or wireless internet in the rooms. Again nothing wrong with the hotel, just personal preference."
110,252,Apr 10 2008 	Beautiful hotel full of history.	The Drake is a gorgeous hotel located less than a block away from the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; so if you are looking for a historic beauty and great shopping you've found the perfect place! The staff members were very knowledgeable about local dining and when the power in our room went off they restored it in less than 10 minutes!
111,252,"Apr 7 2008	""Was disappointed"" but loved the city.	Just returned from a weekend stay. Place is beautiful but they don't give much care about housekeeping in the rooms. I was so surprised when I first went into the bathroom it looked like someone just put clean towels but left everything else. There was a USED bar of soap, I picked up the rubber mat to take a shower and there was someone else's hair. yuk......There housekeeping is really bad. I have traveled and stayed in many places, management should inspect the room before giving it to someone. I think a clean room is basic. A lot of small things also........ we spoke to head of reservations to RESERVE a lake view, reservation was done awhile before our visit. We get to the Hotel at 12 noon and they did not have 2 rooms as we requested and booked. They did not even give a reason it was like we never reserved a room, so it doesn't even pay to talk to reservation manager to insure your booking is what you need..... Something that bothered me was after the first morning we used the coffee pot and that day they supposedly cleaned room but did not refill coffee bags,sugar, creamers etc. for following day. It must be a management problem, next time I will spend a little more money and go to another hotel. Great things was location and buffet in morning. Loved the food."
112,252,"Apr 4 2008 	Fantastic stay at the Drake	Went to Chicago for a 10 night holiday and the Drake was quite simply the best hotel i've ever had the pleasure to stay in.Check in staff were friendly and helpful. our room was a very reasonable rate, and the room was enormous, with a large walk in wardrobe, flat screen tv and extremely comfortable double bed.we had a free box of chocolates and bottle of mineral water delivered to us when we arrived, and the housekeeping service was excellent - the room was always spotless and the free chocolates each night and weather report for the following day were nice touches.we were on the 7th floor, which was very quiet and comfortable.all the staff at the hotel were friendly and ready to help out.the coq d'or bar on the ground floor was great - friendly bar staff and the drinks weren't as pricey as we thought they would be.the hotel is located at the top of the magnificent mile, across the road from bloomingdales and close to the john hancock centre, macy's, h&amp;m, borders and victoria's secret. it's also right by the beaches on lake michigan. there are lots of bars nearby.i don't have a bad thing at all to say about this hotel, it was wonderful and we didn't want to leave! the only problem now is that any hotel i stay in in the future will be compared to the drake and i don't think anywhere will beat it for price, luxury and service. i can't wait to go back to chicago and stay again."
113,252,"Apr 3 2008 	Pricey - But Very Nice!!	I'm a regular at The Drake. Been staying there every couple months for the last two years.LOVE this hotel!! The lakeview rooms are to die for! Nice, airy, and roomy. Most comfortable beds in the city. Staff is ultra pleasant and helpful at all hours. Check in and check out are efficient and friendly.Restaurants serve delicious food at all hours.Location is perfect. Right off N. Michigan Ave. Walking distance to all shopping and restaurants.A bit pricey, but well worth the money. The Drake gives you a nice pampered feeling while away from home."
114,252,"Apr 1 2008 	Too Big for Their Britches	I stayed at the Drake for a business event. The event went smoothly and the staff was accommodating. However, the room was less than I expected for the price. The reduced rate was $160/night, (+ junk fees &amp; taxes) which was acceptable for downtown Chicago in the off season. There where several things that seemed out of character for a hotel of such notoriety.1) Charging for Internet Service - I travel extensively on business and I expect free internet as much as I expect clean sheets. To charge an additional $12.95/day is insulting.2) No Fox News Network - I did not stay at the hotel to watch TV, but I expect the most popular channels to be available when I do have the time to catch up on the news. FNC is the leading cable News Network and to not provide it is crazy.3) The tub did not properly drain, so by the time you are done with your shower, the water is up to your calves. 4) They charged me for something from the mini bar that I did not use. (They removed it from my bill without any problems, but it never should have been there to begin with.)5) Charging for a local call seems silly in this day &amp; age as well, but I admit, I never even thought about the cost when I made the call. The $1.25 to cancel dinner reservations was my fault. I should have known better. Generally speaking the hotel service is well above average. The hotel itself is a beautiful old hotel that, while a little worn around the edges, it basically well maintained. The one bright side was the concierge service. They made great recommendations and got us dinners reservations when we wanted."
115,252,"Mar 21 2008 	Nice but somehow disappointing	Stayed at the Drake... can't quite put my finger on it but I was disappointed. Perhaps its because we didn't stay in a $500/night room, but I was expecting &quot;more&quot; from my $250/night room. It was clean and comfortable but small. Nothing I can complain about, after all, it did have a view of Oak Street Beach and the lake. And it snowed while we were there so it was quite picturesque."
116,252,"Mar 15 2008 	A mix of history 	The Drake has been around for many decades, yet the hotel still exudes elegance &amp; sophistication. We had a beautiful room on the 5th floor overlooking the northern view of Lake Michigan. The room was very clean and quiet. The hotel staff was very accomodating and knowledgeable. The location of The Drake is very nice, however I prefer the location of the Marriott on the Magnificent Mile. Overall, my stay at The Drake was above average and I would recommend it to any of my friends or family."
117,252,"Mar 6 2008 	Disappointed	We booked a junior suite with lake view, and expected what was shown on the web site -- a big, open large suite. What we got was a small bedroom and a small sitting room. We were on the 3rd floor, and our lake view was marred by a view of the roof of the portico and the HVAC pipes.There was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom, and the hair dryer died during the first use. We had a man from maintenance in the room for about an hour. Who wants that? They took out the dead hair dryer, leaving us with a dinky little piece of junk hair dryer. There is very little counter space in the bathroom.There was a leak from the toilet pipe through the wall in the bathroom onto the floor, obviously of long standing. All of this was reported to management on the form they requested us to fill out. Yet not a word from them apologizing for the problems.The guys at the front door were first rate. People you talked to in housekeeping were just as nice as can be. But the room itself was a disappointment, and I've already steered two people away from the hotel for a visit nest month."
118,252,"Feb 29 2008 	beautiful lovely and very kind staff	My husband, myself, my son and my grandson stayed for three nights the weekend of January 18-21, 2008. We booked two family rooms.The rooms were large and spotless, the hotel itsself is so clean, i could not see one speck of dust on any of the 50 plus chandeliers. My grandson became a friend of Carlos the doorman who remembered him every time we came back to the hotel from some great museum.My grandson is special needs and the kindness they showed him will always stay with me. Thank you Drake hotel and Staff.p &amp; j brochsteinDetroit"
119,252,Feb 27 2008 	Drake a great hotel!	Just stayed at the Drake on business and had a great experience. The location is fabulous and the lobby is breath-taking. My room was very large with 2 bathrooms however don't expect to see much if you have a city view. That was fine with me as I was mostly there to sleep. I would definitely stay there again.
120,252,"Feb 21 2008 	Terrific Hotel	The Drake is an absolutely wonderful hotel. It combines old world elegance with all the modern day amenities. Add a terrific location and room views, and this hotel is clearly one of the best in Chicago. The restaurant overlooking Lake Michigan was great, the lobby bar upscale, and the rooms unbelievable. The room was the largest I have stayed in on any business trip. This also includes the size of the marble bathroom. The bathroom itself had both an oversized tub and marble shower. My coworker and I were completely impressed and excited about making a return visit sometime soon."
121,252,"Feb 19 2008 	Grand Dame Still Has It	My husband and I stayed at the Drake for one night during a weekend visit to Chicago. We've stayed here before, in a variety of rooms, and have always been pleased. The Drake has always had a certain mystique to me, who grew up in the area and aspired to stay here, so there's always the element of having &quot;arrived.&quot;Of course, &quot;arrival&quot; means one of the grandest hotel lobbies around, with lush furnishings, huge flower arrangements, ornate fittings, and all the other accouterments that a Grand Dame hotel requires. They are all in spectacular form.We didn't upgrade to an executive room, or lake view, as we sometimes do, because we were doing little more than sleeping here this time. The room was nevertheless attractive and comfortable, with all the expected amenities, though the bathroom could use a touch of updating. The bed was quite comfortable, and the room temperature was right on -- important when the outdoor temperature was in single digits and windy.The Drake is not the most modern of hotels, but for a comfortable stay with all required amenities, plus a touch of history and old-world charm, it's a winner."
122,252,"Feb 11 2008 	loved the Drake	We stayed at the Drake twice recently - January and February 08, after not staying there for several years. I love the Ritz Carlton and usually stay there - but it is pricey. We got an excellent bargain at the Drake - $135 last weekend - and a good price in January - both for a &quot;room selected at check in&quot;. This seems to be an out of the way room with a terrible view. I did ask to move, but was politely told that other rooms in the category I reserved in would be very similar. The rooms however, were lovely, the beds supremely comfortable, the bathrooms small but very nice, and we were in a great hotel in a great location. Loved tea at the Palm Court. Breakfast at Drake Brothers was fantastic - my January bargain included free breakfast - this is the best buffet! We had dinner at Drake Brothers because the weather was so cold we didn't want to go out - and it was great. I read the reviews from people who reserve through Priceline and were unhappy with their rooms - I think when you get a good bargain, you can't expect to get their best room. That was a trade off that I was happy to make to stay at this lovely hotel for a remarkable price."
123,252,"Jan 29 2008 	Best stay in Chicago....	We stayed at the Drake for our Anniversary last weekend. We were pleasantly surprised with an upgrade to the Vista Suite. The view was spectacular. Seperate living room and bedroom. Wet bar as well.We were then surprised with a bottle of wine, appetizers, and small cake from room service. The Executive Lounge was closed. We were given vouchers for appetizers in the Palm Court as well as the full breakfast buffet for the next moring in the Drake Bros. restaurant. We dined at Drake Bros. with excellent service and the food was wonderful. One other table was seated, although it was late for dinner. We then danced in the Palm Court to some great Jazz....All in all a fantastic weekend. We have to thank the entire staff for making this wonderful."
124,252,"Jan 28 2008 	It's just right	What a great place! Spacious, comfortable room &amp; bed, considerate service, outstanding restaurants, trouble-free high speed internet access. Nice location with many good restaurants within walking distance. A classic glamorous hotel."
125,252,"Jan 17 2008	Best in Chicago	I only stay at the best hotels and when I am in Chicago its the Drake, daughter and I stayed two nights. The treated me like I deserved to be treated. I would have only fired one staff if I owned it. Best suite in the house and didn't charge me what can I say. Good service and luxury are a standard of this world class hotel as its stood the test of time will return"
126,252,"Jan 17 2008 	Experience The Drake Hotel Chicago.	We did a 4 week tour of the USA over December/January 2007, with 3 older children (girl, 22, boy, 19 and boy, 18), going to San Francisco [Omni Hotel], Miami (South Beach) [Beacon Hotel], Orlando (Disneyworld, Pop Century Resort), Chicago [Drake Hotel], New York (for Christmas) [Beacon Hotel], Boston [Omni Hotel], New York (again) [Roosevelt Hotel] (including New Years Eve at the Renaissance Hotel overlooking Times Square), and a day trip to Niagara Falls. It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids.Anyway, here are my accommodation reviews. Ill mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. I chose The Drake purely on its reputation, history, celeb status, etc. I did not expect this to be a cheap or budget stay (and was not disappointed!), but I did try some cost-saving measures which The Drake was happy to accommodate (see below). Put simply, I wanted to stay at the famous Drake Hotel in Chicago, regardless of cost.I couldn't seem to get a travel agent who could organise it, so I ended up contacting the hotel itself. I tried email from their website several times early in 2007 (for a December stay), but received no response. As I really wanted to try this hotel, I ended up phoning it from Brisbane, and made the booking that way. The girl I spoke to was very helpful with room options, but despite a promise that I would receive email confirmation, none came. It may have been my &quot;Strein&quot; accent. However, when I sought confirmation in November by email, I did get a favourable response promptly by email, and when we arrived at the hotel for our 3 nights, all was in order.One thing to note - we couldn't pre-arrange transfers from Chicago O'Hare airport to the city (the only place in many countries and cities that I haven't been able to), but it was simple enough to arrange a return transfer door-to-door from the transport desk near luggage collection at the airport, and phone in a booking for the return journey.The Drake is an old and impressive building, with views of Lake Michigan. Great foyer. It was all I'd hoped for in that regard. It is very well located - close to shops (including Macy's) and restaurants (some great and reasonably priced Irish pubs - we ate twice at the close-by Dublin Pub it was so good - and it is also close to a great pancake place - The Original Pancake House - where we had breakfast every morning). Some of our best meals were in Chicago. The Drake is also virtually next door to the enormous John Hancock Centre (you can view The Drake from the top). Very convenient location.We had a Junior Suite with two bathrooms, which would have been superb for less people. It had 2 comfortable queen sized beds, couch and chair, desk and chair, TV unit with drawers, closet, room safe, minibar, ethernet, and two enormous bathrooms (I'd say the best bathrooms on the trip). As there were 5 of us, we also took 2 trundle beds (my cost-cutting measure) at no cost (that I'm aware of). The staff were helpful in that regard. That meant everyone had a separate bed, but it was cosy, and the two extra beds (which stood upright during the day) took up a lot of floor space at night. We had windows but were too low down for a good view. The room was quite austere - very Hilton - but nothing to complain about.Reception/check-in was fine, as was check out, and the staff helpful with maps, etc.We did a city tour with an ex-Chicago cop as a bus driver/tour guide, which was very entertaining. We later changed buses to go to the John Hancock Centre (which was the last stop on our tour). Both drivers were happy to stop the bus and open the doors to let me take photos. Afterwards, when we were supposed to be returned to our hotel (remember - just around the corner from the John Hancock Centre), that bus driver was kind enough to take us all the way to the Sears Tower, even though he was under no obligation to do so. Just us 5 in the big coach - he earned his tip for that! At the Sears Tower, the bus driver (at his own suggestion) got out of the bus, lay on his back on the sidewalk and took photos of us 5 with the Sears Tower towering above us. Very friendly folk in Chicago. One girl passing in the street offered us help to find the Dublin Pub without being asked, simply because she'd heard us mention it .Lake Michigan was an awesome sight in winter.I recommend the free zoo at Lincoln Park.Chicago was great, and though expensive, I'm pleased that I stayed at The Drake."
127,252,"Dec 17 2007 	Adored the Drake Hotel	I have stayed in hotels around the globe and I can honestly say by far The Drake Hotel in Chicago is my favorite. It is vary clean and well kept. There are several restaurants and bars. The food is the finest. The staff from Ben the black doorman who is preacher to the General manager who is beautiful pampered me with everything I needed for a comfortable stay from cosmetics by Gilchrest and Solmes of London to Fresh news papers. Dont loiter in The lobby because you may be offerd a coffie and a copy of the Chicago Tribune. They dont miss a beat. They have a mall or arcade in the basement with many great stores even an art Gallary. I adored their Restaurants and I dont remenber all the names but the restaurant which is a straight walk from the lobby through palm court has the finest views of the lake in all of chicago. I have stayed at most of the hotels in chicago and no hotel has better views. The Drakes Chose the location in 1918 as the place to build way before any of the others. They did pick the best spot in all of chicago! Back then Wicker park was a farm where the Scandinavians retreated to. And as a matter of fact The Drake Hotel is in the Movie Wicker Park. Its purely a grand classic from the wooden elivators with the cushy couchs and fresh fruit at every stop to shoe shines in the lavatorys. The Hotels grand lobby is decorated with fine Italian furnature and everything is always spotless and in perfect shape. The only I can compare it to is Buckingham palace. Its a classic! I promise you will love it! When in Chicago if you happen to be visit this grand hotel over a drink or dinner and you will learn that it is the best. I have stayed in it many times and I loved every minute of it,"
128,252,"Dec 15 2007 	Beautiful hotel...low class accomadations	My wife and I stayed at the Drake in June. The hotel is old and beautiful and well cared for. Our only complaint was that the gift shop sells hardcore pornography magazines....right at eye level, with no cover. We thought it very tacky of a &quot;classy&quot; hotel that is supposed to be family friendly. So, if you travel with your kids, I wouldn't recommend staying there or if you do, don't take them in the gift shop unless you want to do some serious explaining."
129,252,"Dec 14 2007	Glamour	Location, Location, Loction. At the lake end of &quot;the magnificent mile&quot; you couldn't get a better spot for a shopping trip. Large rooms, clean large bathrooms, excellant staff on reception and in the bars and restaurants and a stunning entry way into the hotel as it was decorated beautifully for Christmas!This is not a cheap hotel, but worth the money.I'll be back"
130,252,"Dec 8 2007 	The Drake is Lucky	For an expensive hotel, the Drake is pretty cheap, and cuts lots of corners. It is, properly, only a four star hotel in spite of its tradition. Its policy of charging for an unused final night of your reservation is understandable, since there will be many things that make you want to leave early.But on my first stay, a large ensemble of child violin students at a convention serenaded the lobby, and the memory of that brought me back.This time, as my wife and I were approaching dark and cold Chicago, expecting a storm, on the hours-late California Zephyr, I got a Drake concierge named Andrea on my cell phone. She arranged for a car to meet us. What she did extra was to inspire confidence in her and the arrangements she would make, and to convey friendly reassurance to us in the snowy Colorado desert. &quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; she signed off.The Drake has been lucky. I'm not sure I would play the odds again."
131,252,"Dec 7 2007 	Wonderful Hotel	My husband &amp; I stayed at the Drake hotel for an anniversary get away this past weekend. We booked and paid for a king room two weeks before our arrival. We received a free upgrade to an executive suite upon checkin. Our room (number 625, the Churchill Suite) was enormous with great views of both the lake and the city. The room was clean &amp; the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with an ok bathtub &amp; a nice seperate shower. We had no complaints with the room &amp; would highly recommend spending the extra $$ to get a suite at this hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful. The hotel staff was courteous &amp; helpful from check in to check out. Valet was very prompt upon check in but a little unorganized when we checked out. Things to definitly do at this hotel: Sunday brunch at the Drake Bros. restaurant. Pricey but well worth the $$. Entertainment in the Palm Court on Saturday evening. They had a jazz group there the night we stayed &amp; they were very good. Check out the shops on the lower level of the hotel before heading out to Michigan Ave. Things to skip:If you don't like tight crowded spaces...skip dining in the Cape Cod restaurant.The Saturday night lines can be long waiting for the hotel staff to get a cab for you. Take the 1 minute walk to the end of the block &amp; you will be in a cab much quicker than waiting in front of the hotel. If you do have access to the Executive Lounge don't bother. This was the only thing we were dissapointed with. It had the exact same view that we had in our suite. There was a very small bar with a bartender that was not as friendly as the bartenders in other parts of the hotel. They have a free breakfast in the lounge but we opted for room service after our experience in there the evening before."
132,252,"Dec 6 2007 	Never again	We stayed at the Drake hotel over Thanksgiving and we did not like it at all. Not only did we have a smelly room (the smell - from a room deodorant??? made us sick) but the room rate ($ 430) for a standard room on the first floor with no view at all was outrageous compared to other hotels in the same category where we stayed before. And for breakfast we had to pay extra!!!Thank you, never again."
133,252,Nov 30 2007	think twice	Got a great rate on Hotwire $139.00 The hotel is an old city landmark at the far end of the mag mile. The lobby is ornate with fabulous holiday decorations. The bar is old school with live music and dancing. We requested a room with 2 beds because we were traveling with children. The room was small - the beds were larger than a twin but smaller than a full. When we asked for a larger room we were told that all the 2 bed rooms were the same. There were no roll away beds available. The room was very hot with windows that did not open. We shut the heat off but it continued to cycle on and off all night long. The shower head in the tub was fixed at an angle toward the wall making it impossible for a tall person to shower. I would definitely never stay here again if I needed a room with more than one bed and a comfortable temperature. Complaints to the management were initally met with arogance Eventually we found someone willing to compensate us for a horrible nights sleep with a gift certificate to one of the hotel's restaurants.
134,252,"Nov 19 2007 	It is what it is	We booked on Priceline for $122 per night, an absolute bargain for Michigan Avenue on the weekend of the Magnificent Mile Lights Festival. While The Drake is old and I prefer newer hotels the price couldn't be beat. The room was acceptable, the hotel location is fabulous and the staff was great. We were even able to extend our checkout time by one hour without any issues. All in all I would highly recommend The Drake if you're on a budget and want to stay on Michigan Ave. If you prefer newer hotels you should consider something else. For $122 a night booked on priceline I would definitely stay here again! This place has charm and character you won't find in other cookie-cutter hotels."
135,252,"Nov 19 2007 	Old style Chicago	Great hotel, paid $270/night which is at the top end of the spectrum. The room was large, clean and well decorated, and perhaps most importantly it is in a very good location. I stayed for 5 nights and found the checkin staff very helpful - checked me in at 1pm with no wait - straight to my room. The lobby is fantastic and this is reflected throughout the rest of the hotel. The one area the I would say they could imprve on is the style of the rooms which are good but look dated in the schemes that have been chosen."
136,252,"Nov 18 2007 	The urban myth is true!	The Drake is everything the urban myth says it is - I absolutely loved it! The hotel is old-school luxury - sumptuous velvet, amazing service and a small ornate bench in the elevator in case you get tired during the ride! Other reviews that I read had a few negative comments - personally, I could not fault the Drake in any way. My room was spotless and very comfortable with easy chairs and ample room. The location, the breakfast, the Palm Court Lounge - all just fabulous and I was sorry to hand over my room card. Special mention must go to John Dowd, the head concierge, who was my guide to Chicago. His service extended across the Atlantic Ocean and was super-efficient in making sure that I had the best time in Chicago.I am now a loyal fan of the Drake and recommend it to everyone. Staying at the Drake is the perfect treat in the perfect city."
137,252,"Nov 7 2007 	Best Hotel Room EVER	My room at the Drake Hotel in downtown Chicago was absolutely the best hotel room I've ever stayed in. It was huge .. it had lots of windows, and was very regal. The staff was great, the hotel was beautiful. And for the price, (given downtown Chicago prices) it was actually a great value. Highly recommended to anyone .. it's also a Hilton network hotel which is why I chose it."
138,252,"Nov 6 2007 	Pay Full Price or Don't Stay At All	Booked thru Priceline for $122/night (yes, I know, cheap). Upon check in, my only option (for me and my buddy) was a King smoking room. I went round and round with the front desk clerk. He went to talk with his supervisor and came back and said that was my only option for the first night, then they would move us the next day. He said, and I quote, &quot;That's what you get for booking though Priceline.&quot; I was just so tired and had gotten so much attitude from the guy that I gave in. Went up to the room and it smelled TERRIBLE. Quite possibly the WORST room I have ever stayed in. Of course it smelled like an ash tray, but they also used this spray to diminish the smke smell and that was even worse -- think about what a port-o-let smells like. Plus the cooling system didn't work so it was way too warm despite the fact the window was open all night. The room they moved us to the next day was only slightly better, even though the inside of the lamp shades had brown stains (how does THAT happen?). Overall, the hotel is worn with frayed carpets and wallpaper that's coming off the walls. Both my rooms had stained celings in the bathrooms.Upon check out, my bill was wrong because they incorrectly charged me for mini bar items I did not consume (c'mon, who really pays $10 for a bottle of Evian?). And parking is $45/night, but I'm ok with that because that's anywhere.By the way, half of our group also used Priceline to book their room at the Intercontinental (also on Michigan Ave) for $100/night and got a fantastic room without the hassle and attitude.All in all, it seems as if the Drake is wonderful if you pay full price. For the rest of us who are travelling for pleasure and who find it difficult to pay more than $200/night, don't have high expectations for this hotel. To me it seems as if once they learn you booked through Priceline, you're a 2nd class &quot;guest.&quot;"
139,252,"Nov 4 2007 	Nice Old Hotel	Just back from a stay at the Drake. While it is an old hotel, I was completely satisfied with the room, the service, and ammenities. Bed was excellent as were the linens and internet service was good, which is important to me. Downtown location is great.I always book through Hilton.com and had a very nice room. I don't know what happens if you use other websites, but I can understand why they would not get a high priority with the hotel. There is a great benefit to hotel loyalty. I highly recommend the Drake, but if you are looking for &quot;bargains&quot;, it's probably not the place for you."
140,252,"Nov 1 2007 	Wonderful Repeat Trip	This is our go-to hotel whenever we are in Chicago. Try to get a corner suite overlooking Michigan Avenue. Great views and service: turn down every night, with cookies and milk for the kids; super-soft robes and wonderful location.I could go on and on about this great hotel...I would leave every morning before six a.m. for a jog along the lake. The doormen/valet were so supportive (singing the Rocky theme, and even timing me!)We stayed with six people: two adults, and four kids. Great time all-around."
141,252,"Oct 31 2007	Very nice but wouldn't pay the advertised price!	My husband and I spent two nights at the Drake at the end of our Chicago stay. We were fortunate to receive an employee rate, which brought the room under 200$ which is excellent for any Chicago area property, let alone a landmark. The hotel is attractive. Our check-in was easy and we were treated well, despite paying less for our room. Yes, the hotel is old, but it is by no means falling apart. Our room was well-appointed and well decorated. Our bathroom door did not shut perfectly due to age, but who cares. We were greeted with a variety of fresh berries and a berry tart presented attractively in our room. The hotel has a good location, close to the lake and close to shopping. It is not close to a Metro station. We made the mistake of schlepping our luggage down MI avenue to the hotel and it was a long walk!The beds were comfortable and I thought the bathrooms were beautiful. We did not eat at the hotel. Our carpet showed some signs of wear. All in all, I was very happy to have stayed at such a famous hotel and there were no problems at all with our stay. To be honest, we spent very little time in the room. We took the Architecural Society's boat tour which was wonderful. I wouldn't recommend wasting to much time with Navy Pier- very touristy and crowded, with no place to eat. The Shakespeare company was good though. We enjoyed Millenium Park. I had been there for the grand opening and it was just as good, and less crowded than I had remembered. We stayed outside of the city for a week as my husband had business, and I was able to visit the botannical gardens, which are not to be missed. This is a huge garden and it is magnificent. There is an excellent outdoor train portion as well."
142,252,"Oct 29 2007 	Old World Charm	Stayed there for my birthday weekend and was taken back in time to Old Chicago! Great High Tea service and unbeatable lake views from rooms on that side of the hotel. Although it's showing its age a bit, there's still so much history &amp; charm around every corner. A wonderful departure from the normal tourist hotels. While you're there, head up to the 96th floor of the Hancock Tower for a cocktail and one of the best views you'll ever see."
143,252,"Oct 29 2007 	Pay full price and you will be treated well	The Drake is a nice location in Chicago, though needs some work inside. We booked through Priceline and thank the Lord we did. I can't imagine paying anymore than $120 a night for that dump. However, when you book through a discount hotelier be prepared to be treated like crap! The valet guys were great...but then again they didn't know we didn't pay to full $300+ full price a night. We asked to get 2 double beds and not a King (because we had 2 small children) and they refused to do that even though most hotels will do that simple change with Priceline patrons. They claimed none of the rooms in our group would accomodate more than 2 people (even with an airbed) but my sister got a large corner unit that would have(also booked on Priceline for $120). They lied... We booked 3 rooms there for the weekend because we had a wedding in town. I ended up &quot;selling&quot; my unit to a relative and got an even better room via Priceline at the Westin River North(see that review). Don't waste your time or your money at The Drake!"
144,252,"Oct 15 2007 	Exactly as it says on the tin	Stayed at The Drake for five nights in October. It was recommended to us as an &quot;old classic Chicago hotel&quot; and that's exactly what it was. We booked a king lake view room and got an excellent large corner room with a lovely view. The hotel is full of it's old character, nice bar, good food and staff and overall we had a very enjoyable stay. It's in a great downtown location right next to the John Hancock on Michigan Ave. Don't book here if you're looking for something modern or trendy. It's an old world hotel and it met all our expectations."
145,252,"Sep 26 2007	Old and Unsatisfactory	We checked in very late at night, we had called ahead to tell them, and when we got up to our room, it was a very smelly smoking room with dirty carpet and paint peeling on the walls. The front desk did not let us know when we arrived it was smoking and then told us it was the only room available when we called down to change it. They did move us in the morning, we had to request again ourselves, but the room they moved us to also had dirty carpeting and paint peeling off the walls. You can tell what this hotel was once, but it is really worn out now- badly needs a face lift. On the positive, the bed was nice and fluffy."
146,252,"Sep 25 2007 	Historical ""Yes"" Needs Update	Yes the Drake is a very historical hotel in Chicago and that is why I wanted to stay there. However, historical you have to remember also means &quot;old&quot; and that is exactly what the Executive Suite on the 10th floor that I stayed in for a week was. The carpet was so old that what used to be an embossed design was evenly smoothe to the floor and discolored. The bathroom although it had a granite countertop still looked really worn by the wood trim and cracking around frames. The so called DSL you had to pay 16.00 a day did not work and I had to keep going down to the lobby in order to use the wireless connection. If you are going to put 2 beds in a room at least make sure that they are full size and not just an oversized twin...the towels felt like sandpaper...The staff was very accomadating and friendly."
147,252,"Sep 16 2007 	Love theDrake	I took vacation during July 4 for a few days in Chicago. I decided to stay at the Drake for its view of the Lake. Also, I don't want to look out the window and find myself staring into the rooms in other buildings. I stayed in one of the lake view rooms at the executive floor and it was exactly what I wanted. It had a fantastic full view of the lake and the Lake Shore Drive (see photos). The room was large, clean, meticulously decorated, and you can tell the hotel paid attention to every detail in the room. My luggage arrived promptly. Then a hotel staff brought water and a box of chocolate (free, in case you wonder!). Ill definitely return next time I return to Chicago. The only drawback was that the parking at the hotel costed $42/day but you can park elsewhere and take the CTA train or walk."
148,252,"Sep 15 2007 	Lovely Hotel - great location	My husband and I spent last weekend at the Drake (Friday &amp; Saturday night). We were in Chicago for the weekend with friends. Very pretty hotel, fantastic location. Close to great shopping! Nice views of the lake from our room. We had high tea on Friday and it was really wonderful. Conceirge was fantastic. The only complaint I would have is that the it's impossible to close the door to your room without making a loud bang. So if you like to sleep late, just be aware that other people leaving their rooms earlier in the day will probably wake you up when they close their doors. I would stay at this hotel again... it has a great old time elegance"
149,252,"Sep 14 2007 	Nice just not my style.	We visited Chicago courtesy of our in-laws, who surprised us by springing for a suite. The room was HUGE. Like, too huge. It would have been nice were there not so much wasted space. Our suite was on a corner, which may have made some of the difference, and it was quite oddly shapen. There was a large sitting area and large closet and wet bar. Additionally, there were two pulldown beds that sprung from the wall. It was a bit odd and it wasted a lot of space, as we did not need the extra beds. The bathroom, though well appointed, was quite small and that extra space would have helped there. The bed and furnishings were nice and well taken care of. Super comfy bedding with a nice duvet. Unfortunately, the armoire that contained the tv was in a location such that you could not see the tv from the bed, which is rather inconvenient. Our room had a view directly into the Louis Vuitton store, and you cannot beat the location. Immediately adjacent to the hotel is a large mall containing a Bloomingdales and several other high end boutique shops. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional. The hotel is older, but it is maintained well. The Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries are nice.One thing I did find rather annoying- you have to pay $10 to use the gym facilities. That is absolutely ridiculous. The gym is nice and new, but that should be included in the price of stay. We had brunch at the Sofitel Water Tower, which was wonderful. That hotel is a bit more modern and I think if we return to Chicago we will be staying there, but there is nothing wrong with the Drake. Just not my taste."
150,252,"Sep 9 2007 	Chicago great....Drake old and in need of a facelift	With so many awesome hotels in Chicago, I can't think of any reason to stay at the Drake. Our room was old, the furniture was beat up, the shower didn't work properly &amp; the carpet had seen better days. On our way home, the cabbie told us that most people he picks up at the Drake say the same thing. We had a great time in Chicago. Next time we will do more research and make sure we book a nicer/newer/cleaner place."
151,252,"Sep 5 2007 	Hilton Honors members treated llike 2nd class citizens	We just returned from a 3 night stay at the Drake. 2 nights were using Hilton Honors rewards points, and we added 1 night at our own expense. If you think the Drake loves their Hilton Honors member, you will be sadly disappointed. Judging by the reviews and photos posted on this site, we know that the Drake treats their Priceline customers better! Read on: Upon check in, we learned we would have to move after the first 2 nights, because we had booked our extra night in a different category of room than the room booked using our Hilton Honors points (we politely asked if we might be assigned to one room for our entire stay but were told no). Our 1st room was on the 5th floor, off a very small corridor, next to a fire escape. In fact, the fire escape platform was literally attached to our window. We also had a view of the mechanical system, but nothing else. The room itself was very tiny, and the carpet in the room was badly stained and soiled. There was mold growing around the shower bar and soap dish, and the tile grout looked like it needed some scrubbing. There was some fresh fruit and chocolate in the room to welcome us, and since we knew the hotel was fully booked for the evening, we settled in. The first evening, I hardly slept at all due to the air conditioner. It was a warm evening and every time the air conditioner fan turned off there was a loud Bang! It literally made me jump out of bed a couple of times during the night. I finally turned off the fan altogether and slept awhile. At 8am I called the front desk and asked for a new room or to have the maintenance people fix the AC. No offer for a new room, but maintenance did arrive within minutes and fixed the banging AC. We also asked for a morning paper (there's a note in the room saying one can be requested), but never received one once while we stayed in the 1st room. Fresh towels arrived one evening long after we had requested them, and long after I had wandered the halls to find them myself. Believe me, we felt pretty invisible and ignored! Kind of Harry Potter-ish. On the 3rd day, we were required to pack up all our belongings so that we could be moved to the room we had booked for our final evening. When we returned to the hotel that evening our bags had been moved to a large and lovely lakeview room. The carpet was clean, the bathroom was clean. There was no comparison between the rooms, in fact, at the moment we walked in to the 2nd room we realized how truly awful the first room was. And to think that we used a bundle of Honors points on a room that should not have been given to anyone! On the third day we were also told about the amenities available to Hiltons Honors members, although that information had not been shared previously. It was like all of a sudden they realized we were Diamond members. Too little, too late. On a better note, we had breakfast in the hotel, and it was wonderful. The maintenance people were prompt and efficient in fixing the AC problem when they were notified. The maids were friendly and polite. The concierge was helpful and gave good directions and suggestions. But if you want to feel pampered and safe and valued as a customer, find another hotel."
152,252,"Aug 22 2007 	She's still a grand old dame	We got the Drake for $107 for 8/13/07 to 8/17/07 from Priceline.At such a low rate, we thought they'd put us in a closet. They did not. No mention of Priceline at check-in. We did have to wait a bit for a NS King to be available so we went down to the Coq D'Or for some cocktails.Our room was L shaped with the bed in an alcove, and a couch, two chairs, desk and chair, small table and a mini-bar in the other part of the L. The TV was positioned on a bureau such that you could turn it to view from either the bed or the sitting area. We had a great view of the beach and lake. The concierge desk is quite useful. We had a lovely site seeing day thanks to the advice of John, who has a lovely British accent.The entire staff was top notch. We were very well treated."
153,252,"Aug 11 2007 	Love the Drake	Stayed at The Drake with 2 other couple for 3 nights and all of us could not have had a more enjoyable experience. The beauty and charm of the hotel is evident as soon as you walk into the lobby. Unlike many older hotels in the city, all the rooms we were given were very large even though we booked through Priceline. The service we received from everyone on the hotel staff was efficient and first-class in every way. Of course the location could not be better with it being within a short walk to Water Tower Place, Oak St. beach, Rush Street and all the stores and eateries along the Magnificent Mile. The Drake certainly deserves its 4 star rating and all of us would love to stay there again."
154,252,"Aug 6 2007 	Fabulous and chic hotel!	Had to go to Chicago and stayed at the Drake. The hotel itself was really beautiful and what you would imagine a grand hotel would be like. Our room faced the water which was very nice. Good size and clean. Obviously the location cannot be beat-you're close to everything! Concierge friendly and made us dinner reservations. It's not super deluxe but there is a distinct charm that cannot be replicated in some of the newer, more modern or fancier hotels in Chicago. Loved that Chanel was located in the hotel!"
155,252,"Aug 2 2007 	Outstanding	My wife and I and another couple traveled from California to Chicago to tour the city and visit with some local friends. We booked the Drake and each couple had an executive suite with a decent view of the Lake.If you want a super modern hotel, this isn't it. If you like old world charm with dark wood, class and lots of history, this is the place.We enjoyed the lobby bar area as it functioned as a living room when we met our local friends. Nice to have a drink in a nice setting with a harpist. Very relaxing and you could have a conversation.We ate dinner at Drake Brothers Steak House. It wasn't very busy but the food was excellent. We are from wine country and were amazed that you could get a very nice Pinot Noir for $40 a bottle.Lunch and cocktails at Coq de Or were also fantastic.The staff was excellent with a few exceptions as there always are. Clara in the Executive Lounge on the top floor was wonderful. We felt like were in her home...lots of stories of past guests like Prince Charles, Sophia Loren etc. She is a 30+ year employee....that should tell you something.The doorman Carlos was the best. To say he is very attentive is an understatement. When I inquired about the impending taxi strike on the day we were to leave, he said if it wasn't resolved he would take us to the airport as it was his day off. He actually called our room the night prior to departure to schedule to pick us up. The cab strike was on and we were able to get a shuttle. But how many employees would offer to pick you up. Carlos has been at the Drake over 20 years.Pretty close to everything we wanted to see and do but we like to walk as well. Magnificent Mile, John Hancock Tower, bike rentals on the lake, Rush Street clubs...all within a few blocks.We met several other travelers and many make an annual trip to the Drake. We will probably join the list."
156,252,"Jul 21 2007 	Old School Charm nice hotel	Nice hotel. I got a deal through priceline so for the cost of my hotel stay it was definitely worth it. Very 1950s-1960s feel to the hotel. The 6 elevators in the hotel was a nice feature. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to either go up or down. The room was very spacious. It had multiple closets and a separate closet for the minibar. The bathroom, though, could've been a little bigger. The small CRT tv definitely needs to be updated. The bed was nice and firm. No problems sleeping at all. The AC in the room worked well. Overall, no real problems with the room. The conceirges at the hotel were definitely the most friendly people I've ever had to deal with in a hotel. Knowledgeable and funny. They knew their stuff and offered many tips that helped us out. The hotel is close to the Mag Mile and the Navy Pier which is great for anyone coming to visit Chicago. I would recommend this hotel."
157,252,"Jul 18 2007	Everything a hotel should be.	From start to finish, this hotel exceeded all my expectations. Having stayed here previously, I knew that I was getting a good deal.The Drake is elegant and has one of the most professional staffs out there. From the GM down to the doorman, this hotel will take care of you.Upon arriving, I was upgraded to the executive floor. The room had a great view of the lake shore and was extremely well appointed and comfortable. From the fine carpeting to the digital bathroom scale, the room was well thought out.After going for a stroll, I came back to the room to find a small surprise. The ice bucket had been filled by the staff and a refreshment had been chilled for me while I was out. They had even set out some fresh fruit and berries for me to munch on. The GMs card was left as well with a note to give him a call for any issue that might arise. This hotel was greatness."
158,252,"Jul 17 2007 	Good but unfortunately not great	We got the room on Priceline as part of a romantic getaway weekend, and was happy we got the Drake, but were weary that the hotel may have been past its prime. It may be. We were given a room facing the HVAC system, and which featured a size &quot;full&quot; bed, or something smaller than our bedroom at home. We think the room could have fita king size. The room was clean and the bathroom was well appointed, though the shower head hit we at the shoulders (I am 6'3&quot;), and was difficult to manipulate. The room did seem stuffy, and the thermostat never seemed to get to the temperature we were set at.The service we encountered was all good, and the common areas are beautiful. Room service, though pricey, was quick, and when they brought the wrong thing, corrected their mistake even quicker."
159,252,"Jul 14 2007 	Exceeded my expectations.	I stayed at the Drake July 11th for 2 nights. I booked on Priceline and was very surprised to have gotten the Drake. I read quite a few negative reviews on this site and was very worried I would get a dumpy room because of booking through Priceline. I called the hotel a couple weeks before arrival and asked for 2 beds. I was told hotel was sold out for the nights I was staying, but they'd do the best they could etc. I wrote an email to reservations indicating my Silver Hilton HHonors status and again requested double beds with upgrade request. Response came promptly indicating sold out nights again, but to inquire at check in for upgrade.Upon arrival, valet took car with a smile. Check-in was smooth. I asked for upgrade. Again told hotel was sold out and rooms had been assigned by superviser according to requests. I asked how big the rooms were, 150 sq ft? 200, 300? Clerk did not know but said room was comfortable. Was given room 219. Walked down long wide hallways with great anticipation. Opened the door and was very pleased. Room was nice size. View was very good. Faced Michigan Avenue. Extremely clean. Luxurious bed linens. My standard room came with 2 bathrobes. Large tv channel selection. Crabtree &amp; Evelyn toiletries. Awesome deal considering I got this for a steal on Priceline. Turn down service was prompt. Received excellent service throughout whole stay. Only qualm was valet was $43/per day but it is downtown Chicago and because I was traveling with a toddler, for sake of convenience, I didn't look into nearby parking garage options. $43 rate includes in/out priviliges. Took car out several times. Valet guys were quick in getting the car.I would definitely stay here again and would pay out of pocket direct to hotel if I got a good rate. Location is awesome!"
160,252,"Jul 6 2007 	Nice...	We stayed in a single room with king size bed, on the back side of the building facing another building. However, if you looked out the window to the left you can see Lake Michigan!The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was very nice. However, I was a little disappointed that for $400 a night - I had shell out $7 for bottle water if I wanted it (I have been to other hotels that give complementary water when at this price range). As elegant as the room was, it was stuffy and little warm. We had our own thermostat and had it set to 68, but it did not feel as it was set on 68.Location of this hotel is great! Near the shopping and the beach, with plenty of activities to do in the area. Would I return to the hotel? Yes.Recommend it to friends? Yes."
161,252,Jun 27 2007	Heart of Chicago	Elegant! A nd so close to many graet restaurants!.
162,252,"Jun 25 2007	Very nice...but needs some work on service	I'm just back from 3 nights at the Drake. The hotel is beautiful and pretty well maintained. It is very large and I wondered if all the elevators were working since you had to wait a very long time for them to arrive. My friend and I had a twin double and the room was a good size (although the bathroom was very small), as part of a bounceback weekend package. The package also included breakfast. The area is great. Lots of activity and shops, restaurants, etc. Areas for improvement were all around service. Check in took very long since there were only 2 people at the front desk (at 5 pm) and one ofthem attracted a lot of attention with her demands. We didn't receivethe right number of breakfast coupons (and the restaurant was not flexible about this) and so had to go back and wait in line again! The breakfast buffet was very nice (especially since it was included)but don't think I'd eat there if I had to pay the full $25 fee. Once you sat down and they collected your coupon, you never saw your waiter again (so had to really work to get a coffee refill...)."
163,252,"Jun 24 2007 	One of the best!	This hotel is great! I went to Chicago for spring break in March in 2007 and stayed at the Drake hotel. The hotel is nice and big so if you want to explore then you better get your walking shoes. The room was nice and the lobby was too! My room was facing Lake Michigan and had cable TV. There was a fridge,and king sized bed,a closet,and a bathroom which include batrobes to wear. There was even a bed that you could put into the wall if you need more space. Next time I go to Chicago I'm staying at the Drake!(Oh yeah and you can buy the bathrobes for $80.00)"
164,252,"Jun 24 2007 	A Pampering Oasis in a Frantic City	I was visiting Chicago for the Neocon exhibition and my wife and I came a few days early to enjoy the weekend and some (very cheap for Brits) shopping. We had some concerns about mixed reviews but this was my 4th visit to Chicago and I thought it was about time I experienced the famous Drake! We were allocated a 2nd floor room right on the corner over Michigan Avenue. This would have been ideal except we are English &quot;country people&quot; who like to sleep with the windows open! Chicago drivers (and cab drivers in particular) use their horns extensively at any time of the day and night. In addition, the fire service use their sirens constantly and those jarring bull-horns at every junction. There were 5 fires that night! With the windows closed, this wouldn't have been an issue.Next morning, we requested a room change to the back of the hotel and, without fuss, all our luggage was moved whilst we were out shopping and we were upgraded to an excellent room with two bathrooms, two queen beds, two TVs and a partial view across the lake. Thereafter, we slept with all 3 windows open and had no further problems. Both the rooms we used were in excellent decorative order.We had afternoon tea a couple of times in the Palm Court, a full evening meal in Drake Bros (with a table overlooking the lake) and a quick meal one evening in the Coq d'Or. In all cases, the food was excellent with prompt and courteous service. The portion sizes in Drake Bros. were a little overwhelming but this is something we have encountered many times in the U.S. over the years - we just always feel bad about so much good food going to waste.The Drake is an ideal location for &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot; shopping."
165,252,"Jun 20 2007 	Very pleasant stay despite endless hiccups	I recently attended a conference in Chicago and stayed at The Drake Hotel for 6 nights. The hotel lost my booking, found it and then lost it again on my arrival. I had pre-paid the full amount and confirmed this before arrival but unfortunately the hotel managed to lose the documentation, then found it and then managed to transfer the full amount on to someone else's credit card. I was also given the wrong level of room from the one I had booked. Despite all this I really enjoyed my stay. I hired a bike and cycled every day to the conference centre along dedicated paths beside the sea, through parks. Wonderful. Staff happily stored my bike every day. Breakfast was a treat though the staff may have been more helpful if they had stopped me after my 4th course. Very pleasant staff, lovely bar area which had a great camp feel, 2 restaurants (both I thought were rather poor). So despite the hotel appearing to try their best to ruin my stay I really enjoyed it!!"
166,252,"Jun 15 2007 	Just Great!	What a wonderful hotel! I spent 4 days at the Drake in May '07 and have rarely experienced a better hotel. My room and its amenities were great, staff were welcoming and helpful and I found all aspects of my stay to have been a delight. The Drake will certainly be my hotel of choice when I'm next in Chicago."
167,252,"Jun 2 2007 	Historic Hotel in need of a renovation	I stayed here during a yearly business trip in March. This was my first stay at The Drake. While the lobby and the hallways are very clean and shiny, my room was not. The carpeting was a dingy green that was matted and stained from years of use. I would not walk on the carpet without at least wearing shoes. The lighting in the room was dim and not helped by the fire escape located right outside my window on the fifth floor. That did not really matter though because the windows do not open anyway, and they had the kind of glass that is frosted with chicken wire embedded in it on the bottom half. It was best just to keep the curtains closed. Oddly my room door was approached by turning into a very narrow hallway off of the main hallway. The hallway was about 15ft long and only wide enough for one person to fit at a time to enter the room. I did not have neighbors, so I cannot comment on the noise. Rather my room felt very isolated, and I did not feel completely safe in it being down the little hallway and with the fire escape door right next to it. I would not choose to stay here again. I gave it two stars because the hotel outside of my room was quite lovely and they clearly spent time and money on it. It's just a shame I could not say the same about my room."
168,252,"May 21 2007 	Disappointing experience due to The Drake's infrastructure problems	This review is based on a stay from 4/8/07 to 4/14/07. The hotel has some nice features, but my spouse and I reluctantly give the Drake two thumbs down. The Drake has two major infrastructure problems, so avoid this hotel.1. The party walls between rooms are crackerbox thin. There is no sound insulation. At the Drake, we heard our neighbors cough, sneeze, belch, pass gas, and rustle plastic bags. We heard their conversations and their TV sounds, even when the neighbors were reasonably quiet and considerate. This problem goes both ways: This is not a romantic hotel, since your neighbors will hear all of your lovemaking sounds! 2. If you are in Chicago when room heating is required, including early April, bring a portable space heater, or stay elsewhere. The Drake's ancient ductwork blows cool air directly onto the bed. Maybe the ventilation feels OK in the summer.In summary: The Drake has good employees and a handsome cosmetic veneer. But the positive aspects are overwhelmed by the flawed infrastructure. A plea to the owner, Hilton Hotels: Please devote the neccessary tens of millions of dollars to a major infrastructure makeover."
169,252,"May 15 2007 	Don't Pass This One Up if you like the Ambiance of Years Gone By	We spent 4 nights at the Drake in room 329 (partial lake view)via Priceline. If I could be sure that every Priceline Bid wouldbe at a place like the Drake, I wouldn't hesitate to do it everytime. Since this was my first Priceline experience, I'llstill be cautious. Anyway, The Drake was superb. Our roomwas spacious, check-in was expeditious, room service wasprompt (with good food), but expensive as you might expect.The room was made up promptly each day. We did not optfor the evening turn down (which you must request). Gettingback to the room, even comparing to more modern hotels, itwas quite large and in great shape. The bed was extremelycomfortable, The bathrooom was large and we had a foyerwith a very large closet.. My wife opted to have High Tea inthe Palm room. I opted to have a very good martini. It was anexperience that every couple should share.. An excellent Harpplayer, all the opulence of days gone by , very good serviceand the finger sandwiches were not all bad (particularyly with a good martinii). Since we rented a car on our last day inChicago, we had the pleasure of using Valet Parking at thetune of $41.00 per day, but I must say, they were prompt inpicking up and retrieving our car. All in all, The Drake is anexperience to enjoy in an excellent location on Michigan AVe.at the beginning of the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;. We travel to Chicagoevery couple years and we'd do The Drake again withouthesitation."
170,252,"Apr 24 2007 	Fantastic tourist or business location	Great for a weekend getaway. Management upgraded us to a junior suite overlooking Michigan Ave. for $70 a night. We had a low corporate rate to begin with, so the value was excellent. Front desk and bell service made us feel welcome. The suite was really one very large room with two pull down murphy beds, which would have been good for small children. There was an enormous wedding whose masses detracted from the ambiance and overall experience of the common areas. Our room was surrounded by wedding guests, and late night smoking infiltrated our non smoking floor bathroom. I bet the conference/wedding scale is not an unusual experience. We checked out much more expensive Penninsula, and their service and client base were more sophisticated. Overall, the Drake is a great old school hotel."
171,252,"Apr 22 2007 	Maginificent Mile Rave	A surprise 60th birthday gift of an overnight stay at the Drake was the beginning of a lovely, lovely weekend. I have lived in Chicago all of my life and have never stayed at this wonderful hotel. Location of the Drake is outstanding, the lobby is elegant, the Coq d'Or Lounge had lovely musical entertainment, my room had a wonderfully comfortable bed and linens, the hallways and room were quiet. The occasional honking of an outside car was part of the urban ambience for me. Others might not appreciate that. In that case, request a room with a Lake Michigan view.It is a pricey hotel, but special pricing is sometimes offered.I would stay there again in a heartbeat!"
172,252,"Apr 13 2007 	Attentive and caring!	The Drake Hotel is in a class of its own. Last month I had a reunion with four dear friends at the Drake. One of them misplaced her coat somewhere in the hotel. We asked for help in tracking it down. The concierge and housekeeping staff went above and beyond. While we were at dinner a few blocks away, Cynthia from the housekeeping department delivered the coat to the restaurant. This was truly a considerate thing to do and something you don't expect, unless you're staying at the Drake! By the way the rooms are beautuful, and everyone on staff is helpful."
173,252,"Apr 7 2007 	A Grand Hotel	I stayed at the Drake with my husband for a get-away in December. This was our second visit the Drake and we were not disappointed. When we checked-in they said welcome back. Let me say up front we a Hilton Gold members and each time we were upgarded to a large room (might be a junior suite) on the executive floor, which might color my review. The room was lovely and elegant -- crown molding, rich fabrics, a sofa and chairs, bathrobe and slippers and about every amenity you can think of in the bathroom. The heating was a tad bit noisy. The bed, oh the bed. I usually look forward to my own bed after a hotel stay, but the Drake beds are truly heavenly, at least for me. I slept so well! Overall, the room and lighting were just sooo comfortable just visiting for a second time felt like home. The staff were all gracious and in the morning at the executive lounge the hotel manager came by to see how we enjoyed our stay. When we were checking out, as our parking was being validated, he came by again to make sure we weren't delayed. Great Service. The executive lounge has an absoutely wonderful view of Oak St. beach and Lake Michigan. It's a great place to unwind for appetizers and drinks. After dinner we we there again for a nightcap. Lovely furniture and muted lighting. The food was of high quality (salmon, good cheeses, fruit &amp; veggies) and the service was great. The only drawback, if you need a pool, there is none. We will be back for another get-away."
174,252,"Mar 27 2007 	Nice Hotel	We booked 3 rooms for 5 nights March 20-25.Each room was a very comfotable size with decent size bathrooms. The hotel is old and not modernized as the big name and boutique hotels you usually find in big cities.With that in mind,If you go to the hotel with realistic expectations you will be pleasantly surprised.The views each room had were outstanding.That is when we could see,very foggy week. On the down side of the rooms were the fact that you could not control the temperature.I could never get comfortable.The temperature was set on 60 the entire time and It was more like 85.We had the window open (3 inches) as far as it would open and never cooled the room.One of our friends finally ordered a fan for each room and that helped with sleep a little.The rooms were clean and housekeeping did a nice job and the rooms were cleaned early.I had one complaint( to my friends) that my glass globes in the bathrooms had one inch thick dust on each of them.When they looked at the ones in their rooms it was the same.Easy to clean,as they could have been lifted right off and wiped down.That hadnt been done in years. Oh well.The concierge is useless.Go to another hotel for the use of their concierge,it would be quicker and more helpful.He was on the phone the entire time and never looked up.We finally left the line to go find our destination on our own. Terrible attitude on another stop by another time in the lobby.I also would mention the horrible service in the Coq dor Restaurant.We ordered drinks and 45 minutes of trying to stop the waiter for our orders,we finally paid and left.Pretty bad that we left the property to go to another property to spend money because we couldnt get someone to wait on us.Regardless,we had a good time,we probably would stay here again If only for the weekend."
175,252,"Mar 8 2007 	A Very Special Place	This hotel is wonderful. Yes, some of the other reviews talk about the size of the rooms, but this hotel offers many things you can't find anymore. The lobby is amazing, the staff is wonderful, the service is great, but more than anything else, this hotel oozes elegance.There are many four and five star hotels to choose from in Chicago, but this is the only one that makes you feel like you've stepped into another time and place. It is a real treat. The front desk has umbrellas, the bar and lounge area is wonderful, it's recommendations for dinner were outstanding.Don't miss this one."
176,252,"Jan 18 2007 	Not much tops this ol' Grand Dame hotel...	Let me say that I am very high maintenance about hotel rooms - I pick them apart from top to bottom so trust me I scour TripAdvisor reviews when choosing a hotel. My boyfriend thinks I am nuts but that is another story...haha.In all my experiences at the Drake this doesn't happen - I have to search for flaws and if found they are minute.The Drake is a wonderful hotel that is comfortable, very clean, has the old-world elegant feel to it. I tend to stay in mainly at 4* hotels (Westins, Sheratons, etc.) and I will pay a premium for location, comfort, &amp; amenities/luxury.I stayed here once on business for 2 weeks in 2003 and thoroughly enjoyed the service, level of comfort &amp; location. I love these old Grand Dame hotels - hotels like the Plaza in NYC &amp; the Royal York in Toronto, and such. Ones that were built in the early 1900s and that are chock full of beautiful architectural details and have hosted Kings and Queens. The Drake is no exception.I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago this weekend and despite the fact I knew I'd get a much newer room with a glitzier lobby &amp; perhaps more trend at the Ritz or Four Seasons or Park Hyatt but I opted for the relaxed, old school hotel with good service with a smile from the staff at the Drake. There is nothing to compare it to in Chicago. Take a look at my pictures!A few highlights: -we got a great deal on a Deluxe King room - $175 per night versus $300+ for the 5* hotels in town.-great location on the &quot;Miracle (shopping) Mile&quot; on Michigan, overlooking Lake Shore Drive and the lake. Our room had a view onto the lake, one block away from the John Hancock Tower.-super comfortable Hilton beds (this is a Hilton hotel after all)-elegant yet comfortable room furnishings-the bathroom was OK but large and slightly uninspired, BUT the towels were I think the softest I have used in any hotel in the past few years-the bath towels &amp; bathrobes were sooo soft &amp; comfortable which was a nice surprise-the concierge couldn't be nicer &amp; went out of her way to help us with finding a local hair salon for my partner &amp; getting me an umbrella so I could make a after dinner run to the Cheesecake Factory (a guilty pleasure of mine) for some dessert.-free breakfast with the Hilton Honors program was included in our reservation - though the buffet was 6.5 out of 10 (though the French Toast was delicious!) it did include all the basics, including a chef preparing fresh omelettes.If you're going to stay at the 5* in Chicago, the Four Seasons or Ritz, go ahead because the Drake won't surpass them in terms of luxury or swankiness. Can some of the in-room furnishings be updated, yes, can the bathroom have heated towel racks, yes. But if you want a beautiful historical 4* hotel with beautiful public spaces, excellent restaurants, solid service (with a smile), very very affordable luxury, very comfortable and elegant rooms, and an unbeatable location, stay at the Drake."
177,252,"Jan 5 2007 	Very good but not up to par with other 4-star hotels in the area	Comparing this hotel to other 4-star hotels in Chicago, as well as the 3-star Palmer House, I found the Drake to be very good overall but lacking in a few areas.On the positive side, the lobby is beautifully and tastfully decorated, and the hotel is in good repair despite its age. The front desk was well staffed, and the hospitality level was fairly high. And the rooms were well-sized and nicely furnished.On the negative side, the air conditioning or thermostat did not work (which was not that big of a deal in the winter, but the room get too hot for my preference). Also, there were some ugly stains on the curtains and wall paper. But most disappointingly, when I was checking out and needed some shipping tape to seal a box, the first concierge and desk clerks that I spoke to told me they didn't have anyway. Later, I spoke to a second concierge and she found me some, but I was a little unhappy that several staff members turned me away so easily. Other four-star hotels would have made more of an effort in little matters like this.So overall, the Drake is a fine hotel. If you want an immaculate room and top-notch service, you'd do better at some other places, such as the Sofitel, but you can't go that wrong at the Drake."
178,252,"Jan 1 2007	Staying at the Drake is a Treat	The Drake is a beautiful hotel with old-world style and charm, at the same time encompassing modern ammenities. It is especially beautiful to stay here during the Christmas season - the lobby looks exquisite with the ornamental Christmas tree, and the sound of the beautiful harp music coming from the Palm Court, where they serve excellent and delicious afternoon teas. Checkin is usually at 3PM, but we were graciously checked into a room at 10AM, having arrived from a long flight. Stayed in a Deluxe King room facing Michigan Avenue - very spacious, comfortable and charming.One of the best advantages of staying at the Drake is its fantastic location - walking distance from luxury boutiques and department stores, restaurants and city attractions. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel."
179,252,"Dec 26 2006 	Wonderful hotel	My husband and I stayed at the Drake Hotel in Chicago Dec. 15th and 16th. We had a wonderful stay. The hotel lobby was decorated for Christmas which made it even more beautiful . We booked a Bounceback Package which included an excellent breakfast buffet. There was an extensive array of choices which included fresh fruits, omlets, sausages, hot and cold cereal etc. Everything was great. I would highly recommend this package. Our room was large. We had a king bed and a wonderful lake view. We even had time to walk along the beach. The location is excellent. We could walk to all the stores, Rush Street and even to the Navy Pier(which is a little far). Cabs are plentiful . We used the mass transit system ,too.The doormen and concierge were extremely helpful and friendly.The people at the front desk were a bit too formal and stiff.I would highly recommend staying at the DRAKE. The hotel is older- which I liked because it gave you a nostalgic feeling. Everything was CLEAN and polished. I will return again and again. The Drake is our hotel of choice when we visit Chicago."
180,252,"Dec 9 2006 	Not what I expected for the name	Came for some Magnificent Mile time, was a beautiful lobby, of course location was decent, my corporate discount was amazing, and the views were gorgeous. Room was horribly small, AC unit was too loud to sleep, and staff was slow.I think they cared too much about their name and not enough about today. I would have been really upset if I paid close to the regular rate."
181,252,"Dec 8 2006	Everything was wonderful!	I stayed at the Drake for 3 nights from Dec 3 through Dec 6 while attending a conference at the hotel directly accross the street, the Millenium Knickerbocker. I had read the negative reviews about the Knickerbocker, and decided to stay at the Drake. What a delightful experience! The Drake is truly a classy place, in the tradition of grand old hotels. The lobby was beautiful, and the rooms were exceptionally comfortable and very large. Although the carpet was just a bit worn, everything was clean as can be and in excellent repair. After venturing outside in frigid temperatures, it was great to slip into the plush robes that were provided, then later crawl into the extra comfortable, warm bed! I ate at the Cape Cod room in the hotel while there, which was perfect. (Also ate away from the Hotel at The Chicago Chop House (wonderful), Carmines (delicious) and Gino's East (perfect pizza!)). The staff at the hotel were very helpful and pleasant. I would definately stay here again."
182,252,"Dec 1 2006	Is the Drake resting on its laurels?	i recently stayed at the drake for four nights.i have to agree that the property - once you get past the grand lobby area - is in need of a good steamcleaning.the bathroom, while large, felt outdated and dingy.the beds and furnishings have seen better days.my overall feeling was that the property needs one giant upgrade.however, the workout rooms were very nice, airy and well-appointed."
183,252,"Nov 19 2006	Couldn't have been better...	After visiting the hotel for tea on a short trip to visit friends in Chicago as a college student, I decided one day I'd come back to stay at the hotel. I booked a room for a romantic weekend with my husband and really looked forward to it until I read several reviews on this website that left me feeling pretty nervous that our room would have threadbare carpets, tired furniture, etc. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Our room was absolutely lovely - a deluxe room which was quite roomy and had new carpet, linens, and drapes. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The lobby was gorgeous. The best part for me was the hotel's historic feel. It felt like something more than &quot;Joe-fancy hotel.&quot; I highly recommend enjoying afternoon tea in The Palm Court. The food is delicious, the setting elegant, and the harp music will soothe even the most stressed-out traveler. We'll be returning to The Drake the next time we're in Chicago."
184,252,"Nov 14 2006 	Terrible service	Nice lobby, and the lobby restaurant. But rooms are old, sound isolation is bad (rooms are seperated each other by doors, and you can hear the next door easily). But above all, service is very very very very bad!! Was there on business trip, but I would not spend my own one penny there!!"
185,252,"Nov 14 2006 	Awesome stay at the Drake!!!	I was at the Drake from November 5-9, 2006, and I have to say that it was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I was in Chicago for an engineering conference at another hotel. I got a great deal on airfare and hotel through hotwire. The rooms were good-sized and exceptionally clean. The beds were great, and the lobby was like something out of a movie. The best part about our stay was the complimentary limo service (within a certain number of blocks from the hotel). Our driver, PJ, was awesome! I can't say enough good things about the Drake."
186,252,"Nov 7 2006 	VERY faded glory!	Old rooms, bad service, elevators that were so slow and antiquated that you practically aged standing waiting for them, dirty bathroom and especially the toilet - asked 4 times to have it cleaned but to no avail. Noisy air-con system, dirty floors.....generally just really bad and not a pleasure at all to be staying there - You need a face-lift Drake!"
187,252,"Nov 2 2006 	Charming Visit	The Drake is always wonderful. Physically it is not the most modern hotel in Chicago, but the charm and level of service is excellent. We stayed in a deluxe king overlooking the lake and the beach. What a view!! The bed and linens were excellent. The bathroom though &quot;vintage&quot; was sparkling clean. Actually it's look and fixtures are back in style again. The doorman truely remembered us and would start-up our conversation where we left off previously. The concierge also was very helpful with restaurant reservations and finding the appropriate plug adapter for my cell phone charger. We go to Chicago three or four times a year and stay at different hotels based upon our activities but my daughters and I always have tea at the Drake. It is very relaxing after a long day. In my opinion the front desk at all Hilton Hotels could be better staffed and more efficient. This is also true for the Drake. However, this is the only negative about our whole experience and is easy to overlook by all the other good points. An overall excellent place to stay."
188,252,"Oct 30 2006 	The Drake is wonderful!	Just returned from a 5-night stay. With just one exception, everything about the Drake was absolutely wonderful. Reading the TA reviews, I have a very difficult time accepting some reviewers' negative comments as referring to the same hotel as the one in which I stayed. The only exception to an absolutely wonderful experience was the drainage in the bathtub/shower; I did experience very slow drainage, which meant that there were 4-5 inches of standing water in the tub by the time I completed my shower. But, other than this (which is somewhat understandable in an 86-year-old hotel), I found the Drake charming, spotlessly clean, and in a wonderful location. My room was beautiful, spacious, and had a lovely view of Oak Street Beach. The bed was the most comfortable that I have ever experienced. Staff were universally friendly and helpful. I will look forward to the opportunity to stay here again."
189,252,"Oct 23 2006 	Wonderful	Great location, Wonderful rooms and Outstanding service."
190,252,"Oct 4 2006 	Wonderful Stay........	We stayed at the Drake the weekend of Sept 22-24 while in town for my cousins wedding.. First off what a great location.. We stepped into the hotel and were greeted my wonderful staff. We were up on the executive level and was well worth the $&gt;.. Unlimited cocktails in the afternoon along w/ appetizers. Our room was enourmous, almost the size of 2 rooms, we had a large sitting area, couch, coffee table, seperate dressing room and a large walk in closet. This was just the King Deluxe room not a suite...We had room service the first nite, the food was good and it was fun eating off a table set in nice linens they wheeled in the room.. All in all what a great stay and look forward to staying there again."
191,252,"Sep 29 2006 	Disappointment	Saw reviews and was very excited to go to the Drake.Positives: Good Location, Quick check in, easy check out.Negative: * Very Expensive (paid $700 for 2 nights), *Thin walls - You can hear other people's showers, people in their bathrooms, *Our room was next to the storage room - so we constantly heard a door open and shut, *our room was very small- I have had a bigger room at a Best Western or a Marriott*Misleading information on their website- Their website says they have the internet but when you log on you find out that they charge $11 to your room (who charges for the internet).*Can only use the gym for a fee- again who charges for a gym*None of the hotel staff spoke to us"
192,252,"Sep 26 2006	Definately do the Drake	My daughter and I recently stayed at The Drake Hotel for a week. We not only fell in love with this grand hotel, but it was just one reason to go back to Chicago again and again. The Drake is situated right on beautiful lake Michigan and is walking distance to many stores as well as the &quot;el&quot; station. We enjoyed above average service at the Drake, including complimentary champagne and ice cream at The Coq D'Or, beautiful plushy robes, and a staff with a real sense of humor after my daughter overflowed the stately, but small tub. We had more fun enjoying details such as benches in the elevator and fragrant bouguets in the lobby than we ever would have with another sterile pool or cookie cutter room. We will definately go again."
193,252,"Sep 15 2006 	Great Location @ a Historic Hotel	I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Drake and was pleased that the hotel has retained some of it's grandeur. My husband &amp; I were married there 25 years ago. The lobby is still beautiful (exceptional flower arrangements) as well as the Palm Court which serves afternoon tea and has a harpist playing there most afternoons. We were also there on Saturday night when they had a small band &amp; singer for those that cared to dance. Breakfast was quite expensive in the Drake Brothers but on Tuesday nights they have buy 1 steak get one for .01. A group of us went Tuesday night and had great steaks. The service at the hotel was excellent from the front desk to the doorman to the great concierges (my husband used them extensively to book several dinners for large parties, at the last minute). The hotel also offered complimentary limo service (book in advance) to area places as well as to the airports. The only downside that we saw was that the rooms could use a little freshening up. Our carpet was a little threadbare as was the furniture. The bed was wonderful and the bathrooms were clean (altho there was a little problem getting a consistent temperature in the shower, you could get scalded). While in Chicago we had some great meals, including Coq d'Or (piano music at night) and the Drake Brothers at the Drake. We also ate at Shaw's Crab House, the Saloon, Hugo's Frog, Fulton's on the River, Ballo ( a part of the Rosebud organization), Carnivale (wonderful latin food), Marigold (the best Indian food I have ever had), Tuscany (in little Italy), Heaven on 7 for cajun and the best meal we had was at Catch 35(my husband actually had dinner there 2 nights), great fish and on Sunday nights 1/2 priced wine on select bottles. I have heard that the Drake property has been sold to an investment group but that Hilton will still manage the hotel. I hope that they are able to retain it's elegance and update the rooms in the process. I would stay here again. The location is wonderful and the staff is great!!!"
194,252,"Sep 6 2006	What a treat!	What more could you want when waking up in Chicago than to look out your window at Oak Street Beach and Lake Michigan? Our room, a junior suite, was wonderfully large and furnished nicely. The bed was heavenly to sleep on and I wanted to take the pillows home with me. The only complaint was a very slow draining bathtub/shower. The Crabtree &amp; Evelyn toiletries were a nice amenity. Staying at The Drake is like stepping back in time to a grander more genteel way of life. While we were there, we read where the hotel had been sold but would still be managed by Hilton properties. The junior suite entitled us to the Concierge floor where we enjoyed a nice continental breakfast each morning overlooking Lake Michigan. The service was excellent on all levels. They just don't make wonderful hotels like this one anymore."
195,252,Aug 29 2006 	Wonderful hotel	I was attending a conference at the Drake. The hotel was very elegant. The staff were so very helpful and knowledgeable. I was traveling alone so I was a little apprehensive about seeing the sights by myself. The staff gave me wonderful advice on where to go and what to do. The room was beautiful with an old hotel feel. The meals that were provided for our conference were delicous as well. I also took advantage of room service which was quickly delivered to my room and was piping hot and very tasty. I had an awesome 3 days and nights at the Drake. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the &quot;Old Hotel&quot; charm that for the most part seems to be long gone and forgotten.
196,252,"Aug 29 2006 	Excellent Hotel	My wife and I redeemed some Hilton points for 1 night at the Drake and were not disappointed. I've stayed any many Hiltons and must say that this is the most historic hotel I've ever been at. While the room was enough for me and my wife it wasn't the largest we've been in as we usually get upgraded for being a Hilton Diamond member. However, we had a lakeside view which was very impressive. The living room was spacious and the twin beds were very comfortable, plus the closet was very big. Also, the consierge at the Drake was extremely helpful and knowledgable about the Chicago area. This hotel is very convienent if you are going to look around the north area of Chicago. It is a stone's throw away from the John Hancock building and across the street from the Chicago Harbor and Lake Shore Drive. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago."
197,252,"Aug 25 2006	Grand Old Hotel	My sister and I met for a weekend in Chicago and used Hotwire for a 4-star hotel near the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;. We were pleased to get the Drake and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. It has an old-fashioned elegance. Our room was very satisfactory. We had 2 beds and felt like they were bigger than twin size but smaller than full. Not sure this is possible, so maybe they were just extra-long twin? Very comfortable with nice bedding. We were on the east side of the hotel, could see a little of Lake Michigan from one of our 2 windows. I think if you were on the North side you would have a better view. Crabtree and Evelyn bath products. Staff at the bell desk and concierge were very pleasant and accomodating. Excellent location for shopping and many nice restaurants nearby -- expensive ones, but also more neighborhood-type places. The carpet looked like it was from the 60s or 70s, but actually still in good shape. No complaints. We peeked into the room across the hall from us when the maid was cleaning, and it looked much smaller than ours, so like many older hotels I would guess there is a lot of variation in rooms so you don't know what you might get. We paid $127 on Hotwire, more like $150 with taxes and felt like that was a great price."
198,252,"Aug 15 2006 	Great Hotel!	I stayed 2 nights and booked 2 rooms for a family girls (7 of us)weekend. The rooms were very spacious, beds were extremely comfortable from the king bed, full beds to the queen murphy bed and the pullout sofa. We had the &quot;Family Rooms&quot;, one with 2 bathrooms which 4 girls (aged 22 to 13) shared and they loved every minute! Afternoon tea was outstanding - I felt like I was in London again. The entire staff was smiling, pleasant, courteous and extremely helpful. We had to wait 45 mins for one of our rooms to be ready, but they gave each of us a complimentary card ($20 each) to use in the bar. The food is outstanding, especially breakfast. The entire hotel is beautiful and elegant, with the largest floral displays I've seen. The location is perfect and the view of the lake was outstanding. We've decided to make this an annual trip and will certainly stay at the Drake next year."
199,252,"Aug 1 2006 	Great place to stay	Reading all of these reviews made me very nervous. I lived in Chicago for many years, so the idea of staying at the Drake for our recent visit was exciting- it is a famous and historical hotel. In my opinion, the reviews on Trip Advisor are very harsh. We stayed for 3 nights. Had a room on the 6th floor facing north (view of Oak Street Beach). The bathroom had obviously been recently redone- marble tile and very clean. The only thing I can nit-pick about is the carpet- it was a little warn. The bed was so comfortable and clean- white linens/duvet cover. Everything was clean and fresh. We usually stay at hotels such as the Sofitel or W, and the Drake was comparable. We paid a very competitive rate of $219, and for this hotel, I imagine I would pay up to $299 a night. Very nice stay overall- no complaints!"
200,252,"Jul 16 2006	So Romantic	My husband and I celebrated our 17th Wedding Anniversarry at The Drake Hotel, Chicago. At first after reading reviews here, I came close to cancelling my reservation and just rebook at a different hotel. Since The Drake is a well known romantic hotel, we gave it a try anyway. For a 80 year old hotel, the Drake has preserved its elegance.The hotel was lovely..My husband and I love how the lobby was set up and decorated. Our room was nicely decorated, clean and had a wonderful view of Lake Michigan. And staff - very very nice and welcoming. The Doorman Jay was so helpful, after giving us our luggage claim tickets, he directed us to the Front Desk. Bell attendant Octavio right away asked if I needed assistance with my carry on luggage and welcomed us to the hotel. Check in was fast and smooth thank you to the wonderful receptionist Valarie who welcomed us right away with a smile and a faboulous room. Housekeeper was friendly. Room Service staff and Restaurant Staff were nice and friendly. Everything was great. Concierge was indeed knowledgeable and helpful. Express checkout was a great convenience for us as well.The room was lovely, more than we expected. The bed was so comfortable and the room was well cleaned. The Restaurants especially the Cape Cod Restaurant is my favorite. Breakfast Buffet at the Drake Brothers was reasonable @ 22/pax because the food was just great.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Drake Hotel. We will return to Chicago and certainly stay here again."
201,252,"Jul 9 2006	Great location wonderful stay!	My fiance and I just got back last night from five nights at The Drake - our first time in Chicago. As for the location, we thought at first that The Drake was far away from the heart of the city, but we're from Boston and we're not used to such a far-reaching city. We based that assumption on the distance (half a mile? maybe more) between The Drake and the touristy hotspot Navy Pier. We soon learned, however, that there's so much to do right around the hotel - the beach, the upscale restaurants on North Rush, the less upscale bars at Rush and Division. So while The Drake is a good walk from Navy Pier and the river area, it's still in a great spot. The hotel itself is elegant and classic. There are many new trendy boutique hotels in the city, but it was cool to stay in such a Chicago landmark. Our room was on the small side, but it was still lovely, and we think it was abnormally small compared to most rooms (our friends were in a very standard room that was good sized). In the past we've stayed in very nice hotels - The Ritz, The Fairmont, the St. Francis in San Francisco - and the Drake measured right up. We had a great stay and look forward to going back!"
202,252,"Jun 25 2006 	Highs 	In from Toronto &amp; spent a week combined business/pleasure w/ my wife. High points; breakfast buffet was fresh. Service at F desk/concierge/bellhop/cleaning staff/door staff all acceptably good.Great location,good florist &amp; quality bath extras.Impressive banquet, foyer &amp; Palm Court areas.Bed &amp; bedding comfy.Cape Cod Room staff &amp; dining excellent. Historical feel comes through, certainly. Low points; tired room carpeting &amp; furniture,poor bath drainage,&amp; we felt The Drake is asking top-dollar for what is given (you will not come away thinking &quot;wow,what great value!&quot;). NOTE The Palmolive Bldg is in the process of becoming condos. Because Walnut is a very narrow street, those condos will have a great view into rooms on the Drakes' SOUTH side, so at some point I think it would be advisable, privacy-wise, to try your best to get rooms on the north or west side. P.S. This was my second trip to Chicago, which is my fave US city (as it is now for my wife,too) &amp; many thanks to the Chicago people who have made both trips all the better."
203,252,"Jun 19 2006 	This should be a 'Two Star' Hotel	The Drake &quot;used&quot; to be one of Chicago's finest hotels. Well, it's not today. Hotel rooms are dirty and very tired. The first room I checked into had long hair in the bath tub and the carpet had stains on it. I checked into another room to find it clean, yet very in need of touch up. Details like caulking in the bathroom needing a bleach pen. The tub didn't drain and I ended up showering with four inches of water. Carpets needed to be replaced. If it wasn't during the Neocon convention I would have changed hotels.The entire place needs a face lift. Housekeeping staff woke me up every morning talking so loud it was almost shouting. The worst part was the lady was discussing getting her tubes tied to her friend that was down the hall....at 8am. In addition, the walls are paper thin and I could here the couple having sex and talking next door.It's a shame that such an amazing landmark has gone downhill. I wouldn't recommend staying at The Drake. The only benefit of staying here, is it's close to everything. However, there are tons of hotels in the area."
204,252,"Jun 15 2006	Drake Hotel	Stayed for 2 nights at the Drake, supposed to say 5 but checked out early, and move to The Penisula. The only thing nice I can say about the Drake is the that view is spectacular, otherwise the place is an overpriced dump."
205,252,"Jun 15 2006 	Amazing!!!	The largest rooms of any hotel ever! Amazing service, perfect location - worth every penny!"
206,252,"Jun 2 2006	The Drake Hotel did not impress me	For the price we paid, the Drake Hotel did not impress me. This hotel has a lot of history. There is a little display on the ground floor next to the elevator about how Queen Elizabeth, Prince Phillip and Lady Diana have all stayed at the hotel. Each room has a history book in it, too, so that you can read about the history of the place. From that aspect, it was interesting to stay at The Drake. But I have paid a lot less and gotten better service and nicer surroundings elsewhere than we had at The Drake. We had reserved a king bed and upon check in we were offered two over-sized twin beds. When we were unhappy, we were offered a queen bed. When we were STILL unhappy, they &quot;found&quot; a king room for us. The rooms were spacious. The shower was incredibly difficult to figure out. The handle that we thought turned it on would not move. After pounding it and nearly breaking it off the wall, we got it to turn on. We never ate at the hotel because it was overpriced. $21 for breakfast buffet? I would not bother staying there again. There are too many other hotels in the same area."
207,252,"May 29 2006	Unbelivable location location location	The Drake hotel-what can I say. Unbelivable. We travel often/tons- for pleasure-and this was one of the best. Definately as nice as the Ritz, 4 Seasons, etc. but with years of history. We like top of the line hotels and this was it. The beds were so comfy. Goose down duvet. Nice large baths w/granite tops and floors. Gorgeous lobby, great door people, great staff. Most beautiful and huge flower arrangements that I have ever seen in the lobbies. I will never again go to Chicago without staying at the Drake. One block from the beach. 1 mile or less from Navy Pier. Also on Michigan Ave which is the best street. Take your walking shoes. We probably walked at least 40 miles in 7 days. Rooms are nicely updated. Large closets. No balconies or jacuzzi tubs but that's the new stuff. If you're looking for the best location in town and a hotel with a &quot;past&quot; definately the DRAKE is the place to stay. It's good enough for the Queen of England and Al Capone it's good enough for me."
208,252,"May 18 2006	Happy New Year	Love it Love it Love it!! Go for the unique and historical..The Drake is just..classy! It takes you outside the modern world..although it is modern. Classic is timeless..and so it doesn't need to change. And I hope it never does! We stayed over New Years for 3 nights and had a lovely room..very spacious and elegant. The bed is by far the most comfortable I have evef slept in. We wanted to take it with us. We bought the robes..those were very fine. If you can, stay on the Executive level. It added so much to our experience. You can access it all the time..but breakfast is available and also pre-dinner apps and cockatails..all included. The room has internet access for free, and supplies the perfect atmosphere for intimate conversation and meeting people. The drinks include all cocktails, soft drinks and various wines, and the apps were great...veggies and dips, fruits, cheese and crackers, salmon, nuts, a variety, There is something about this hotel that makes you feel &quot;Somewhere In Time&quot;..just happy walking in and out. The restaurants are all awesome and have actually been there for many years. Many of the employees have also been there many years which I think adds so much to the charm and timelessness of the hotel. The seafood is great..the views of Lake Michigan..the staff very nice. When you have afternoon tea (which is pricey..but worth the experience)..it is so cute to see little girls with their moms and their American Girl dolls...such manners! Most everything on Michigan Ave is in walking distance..very convenient and I also jogged each morning..safe and nice to jog around..even in winter! I highly recommend this hotel if you appreciate by-gone eras..America in her infancy and heyday..and classics...and just luxury! This would be a great place for a wedding."
209,252,"May 15 2006	Wonderful	You could feel the history in this wonderful grand old hotel. The service was top-notch and classy. Include the breakfast with your room. The location was great. Shopped on the Miracle Mile. Walked to Old Town to Second City Review via the brownstones. Took the el-train around the city etc. Yes, it is pricey, but it is an experience out of time."
210,252,"May 4 2006	Pleasent stay in this landmark hotel	I visited Chicago a dozen times since 1987, and always admired The Drake's location and architecture. During my latest visit to the town, I finally stayed at The Drake. You cannot really beat the location. I stayed in an Executive Room with Lake View... actually, I would not have stayed there if no rooms with Lake View were available.The hotel was clean and comfortable... I particularly liked the bed... and the size of the Executive Room is generous. As in previous reviews, the hotel could definitely do with renovation... it reminds me of the house of a widowed aunt who used to be rich, but not any more and living on old glory. I did not really mind that.The consierge proved to be very helpful, my only problem was with the front desk staff upon checking in, they claimed I had cancelled my reservation. This was not the case, since I booked online 30 days before my arrival... and obviously had no reason to cancel. I insisted THEY had a problem with their systems and wanted to talk to the manager.... surprisingly the matter was settled a few seconds later... I wonder why the issue in the first place."
211,252,"May 3 2006 	Overpriced and in need of a major facelift	I recently stayed at the Drake for 4 nights on a business trip. My experience was bad from the very start. The staff at check in was very inexperienced and unprofessional. The doormen and concierge were helpful, however. The rooms really need updating- the bathroom was filthy (paint chipping off, scuffs on the doors, dirty bathtub). It's never a good sign when I don't want to take off my shoes or sit down when I enter a hotel room! The walls are very thin- we could hear snoring from the room to our right, and tv/talking/phones ringing from the room to our left)- to the point that we had to go buy earplugs-- and I live in a city. They don't enforce &quot;no smoking&quot; floors- we constantly smelled strong smoke. The restaurant was mediocre, I only ate there for breakfast, and the servers were (again) unprofessional and not the least bit helpful. The drinks in the bar are very overpriced and one person in our party ordered a glass of white wine and it had gone bad. She asked how long they keep there bottles open and he said up to a week, which is ridiculous when you are paying $15 a glass for a very average wine. I got the impression that this hotel makes all their money from private parties. Every time I walked through the lobby there was a wedding or function of some kind, and on more than one occasion there were obnoxious drunk people in the lobby. One night there was a girl (a bridesmaid presumably) passed out at the bell desk, and no one seemed to mind. At the end of our stay, when I paid the bill ($1,400 for 4 nights)- I realized I would have been furious had I been paying this out of my own pocket- and no one asked me how my stay was. This hotel is in a good location, but there are many, many better options in Chicago."
212,252,"Apr 25 2006	Why I prefer the Drake	I left Chicago 5 years ago to move to London, and return regularly. I always stay at The Drake, not only because it holds a part of the Chicago I left behind, but because it has provided us with the location which was only down the street from our former residence. We are still members of The Club International, the private dining club within the hotel, and have always received wonderful personal service throughout the many years that we have used the hotel while living in Chicago and living abroad.From the minute we arrive from the airport, we are greeted enthusiastically by the front door staff, and the bellman. We don't always get the same people at the reception desk, they seem to be always changing or training new people, but still as Club members, and Diamond Hillton Honors card holders, we have experienced a wide range of rooms that the hotel offers generally and to those with Hilton Honors cards. The best rooms face the lake, and the executive rooms offer the best bedding. Yes, the hotel is tired, and yes the bathrooms need to be updated. But the personal service has made up for this over and over. All the staff is friendly. The food in the Executive Club Lounge is excellent, and you would be hard pressed to find a better view--anywhere enjoying a light breakfast or early evening cocktails. The breakfast in the restaurant is always consistently good, and the friendly restaurant staff has always greeted us personally. Where the hotel falls down is the constantly changing reception staff, and many of the rooms need to be updated. But the location is fantastic, the rates are excellent compared to some trendy hotels, especially in the winter off season months, and little Coq D'or bar and restaurant offers a great informal menu. It was always a great neighborhood bar for those who lived in the Streeterville area, and it continues to be that and more to those staying in the hotel. it offers great burgers, light music, and good cocktails. Although there is no health club within the hotel, one only has to cross the street and use the gym in the lower level of mall that houses Bloomingdales. I hope the hotel continues to keep up with the times. I will always hold it in high regard."
213,252,"Apr 17 2006	Not worth the money!	I've stayed at the Drake about 10 times over the past 5 years. Here are my positives and negatives...Positives: Great location, $10/day for the Equinox gym, Lake Michigan View, Breakfast Buffet was delicious but pricey $20/ppNegatives: Bathrooms are in terrible need of a makeover! Service in the tea room is not what I expected-very slow. No gym available inside the hotel, it's across the street.It's not worth the money anymore. The Palmer House has better rooms!"
214,252,"Apr 16 2006	Disappointing Drake	My husband and I stayed here over Easter weekend (also our anniversary) using our Hilton Honors points... chose the hotel for the ambiance, history and charm. Unfortunately, our experience was not what we hoped or expected. When asked for suggestions for brunch, the concierge produced a clipping from the Tribune (I prefer personal recommendations; anyone can read the Tribune!), the bathtub caulk was moldy, our air conditioner broke twice, and no turndown service was provided even though requested. Also, the walls were so paper thin, we heard our neighbors VERY clearly (especially on Easter morning when the neighbor kids got up at 6:30 a.m. to search for Easter Eggs in their room!) While not a horrible experience, it certainly wasn't what I expected from a stay at the famed &quot;Drake.&quot;"
215,252,"Mar 24 2006	Loved the Drake	From the moment we arrived at this lovely hotel until we left,the staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. Check-in was easy and as diamond HH, we were upgraded to an executive room with a beautiful lakeside view. the room was spacious, very clean and the bed was so comfortable. The free water each day was appreciated.Breakfast in the executive lounge was good and the free drinks in the evening were a nice surprise.The hotel has a lot of old world charm and the entrance and lobby are spectacular. The position is good,especially for the shops and there is a lovely lakeside walk.We had absolutely no complaints about the Drake and look forward to another stay."
216,252,"Feb 28 2006	Drake the snake	Having worked in Chicago years ago, I was really looking forward to returning. However, my experience at the Drake was less than satisfactory. We arrived on 14th (Valentines day) to be greeted by a very unfriendly check in staff member. 1. When I booked, the website mentioned that there was a pool..... there wasn't any pool in the hotel at all...instead one accross the road.2. We booked bounceback rate which included a buffet breakfast... guess what.. there wasnt any buffet breakfast during the week at all...only at weekends.3. Overall, the staff were aloof and unsympathetic to our concerns.Will not be returning to the Drake."
217,252,"Feb 21 2006	drilling hammering and cold water for 180 bucks a night	Saved up my dollars and was really looking forward to some old world elegance and charm at The Drake. I'm sorry to say I was sorely disappointed. Yes the lobby, the bar and the elevator areas are absolutely stunning in terms of decor but that's about as old world charm-y as it gets. I had booked in November for a 3 night stay in Feb, $180 per night is not to be sniffed at and having reserved a &quot;king room deluxe&quot; I was expecting something relatively posh - I got a bog standard hotel room with some fancy lighting. The mattress was hard, the water in the shower all mornings was luke warm at best, cold at worst. Clearly the hotel gets v busy at the weekends, so on my second night I had guests in rooms either side of me and in one case I could hear what these people were saying and what TV channel they were watching. Not so much fun at 4am when they arrive back from their night out. On my last morning before departure I needn't have bothered organizing an alarm call - drilling and hammering started directly beneath my room at 8:30am sharp. I have to say the staff at the Drake were extremely friendly and courteous but the service levels are very poor. Its really annoying when you get all excited about a hotel stay which falls far short of your expectations. Also the room service was extortionate - how on EARTH is a seafood salad, a side of fries and a bottle of average red wine $100??"
218,252,"Jan 31 2006	Traveller alert: Beware new reservation policy at Drake Hotel	This is a heads up for all those planning travel to Chicago. Busy professionals often need to change their travel plans. Those who, like me, occasionally find themselves in this situation should be aware that the Drake Hotel now charges the full rate to one's credit card months in advance of the planned visit, and then refuses to refund any of the amount if a cancellation is necessary. This policy is mentioned in the fine print at the bottom of the reservation confirmation, and is not announced on the phone at the time the reservation is made. Busy travellers should band together and refuse to patronize any hotel that follows such an inflexible, and frankly, confiscatory, reservation policy."
219,252,"Jan 22 2006	Exceeded expectations	We stayed at the Drake for one night on January 20, 2006. Having recently moved from Chicago to Arizona and back visiting family, we had one &quot;kid-free&quot; night to enjoy downtown. After checking rates, we found the Drake for $139+tax on a Friday night - a great deal, given the location and the fact that other hotels in the area - Four Seasons, Ritz, Park Hyatt, Peninsula - are in the $300-$500/nt range. After reading the reviews and knowing a bit of the Drake's past, we expected a grande dame, but showing a bit of her age.Well, she does, but don't let it discourage you. First, the hotel exudes old world charm of a bygone era - from the beautiful lobby with it's enormous floral display (being replaced when we arrived with an abundance of lillies, reminding us of our wedding day) to the classic fountain in the Palm Court, to the classic furnishing in the rooms. As for the room, we showed our Hilton Honors card (sign up online before you stay), and were rewarded with an automatic upgrade to a deluxe room with a sitting area. We asked, and we were told that the room would face the Drake Tower. In other words, a view of a brick wall. We instead used the &quot;upgrade&quot; for a standard room with a lake view, and were given a beautifully appointed, traditional room looking out over Lake Shore Drive and Oak Street Beach. The night we stayed there, it snowed a magnificent 4-5 inches of heavy, wet snow, clinging to the tree branches and light posts, and the view was truly wonderful. The bed was comfortable, with lots of down pillows and a comfortable duvet. The only downside - no flat sheet. As a traveler wary of hotel bedspreads/comforters (having seen too many Datelines on the subject), it was a little unneverving, but the linens were crisp, blindingly white, and appeared to be new, so no hesitatation. The bathroom is also a bit of the older type, but good water pressure, standard Gilchrest &amp; Soames products, and perfectly cleaned (not a streak on the mirrors or polished granite floor tile).Another bonus of signing up for the Hilton Honors program was the free breakfast vouchers for the Drake Bros. restaurant. Skip the buffet - we ordered off the menu and it was delicious (scrambled eggs with smoked salmon on an english muffin and lox and bagels with fresh tomato slices, ripe red onion, and abundance of fresh, deliciously salty capers). We expected to be charged for the fresh squeezed OJ and coffee we ordered in addition to our meals and were pleasantly surpised when our waiter smiled and said &quot;no sir, we appreciate you staying here, it is all taken care of.&quot;It was a wonderful, albeit too brief stay at a wonderful old school hotel that still has it all together. Yes, the walls may be bit thin (the neighbors were quiet, although we got back into the room late - remember, we only had one kid-free night to enjoy ourselves) and the chair rails and furniture may be dinged here and there, but the location, the oozing charm, and the value can't be beat. We'll be back!"
220,252,"Jan 18 2006	Classic and elegant - stay at The Drake	My wife and I stayed 3 nights at The Drake in January 2006. As Hilton Diamond members, we were upgraded to an Executive Room with a lake view. It was our anniversary weekend and we were greeted with a bottle of champagne and a small cake in our room. Very nice touch from the General Manager.The hotel is truly beautiful - much like the Waldorf-Astoria in NYC. Location is unbeatable, right on Michigan Avenue and incredible lake views. It is an older hotel, but I didn't see any signs of wear. For the price we paid ($129 a night), it was really hard to beat.We had access to the Executive Lounge for free breakfast each morning and free cocktails in the evening. Everyone was friendly and the rooms were good sized and clean. Bed was really comfortable.All in all, a great stay - no real complaints other than the key not working the first time we arrived as the front desk had told us the wrong room number! Definitely worth a visit to this classic gem."
221,252,Jan 15 2006	Classic elegance	We loved the Drake - rich in history and still beautifully elegant. View of the lake from our 4th floor room was breathtaking and we loved the bar in the Palm Court. Have stayed at other older hotels in Chicago (we're from here and do a hotel stay at least once a year) and was pleased with the room size for an older establishment.
222,252,Jan 10 2006	Beautiful Historic 	My fiancee' and I stayed @ the Drake Hotel back in March of 2005. It was beautiful and comfortable. We may have even conceived our son there:) We stayed in the executive suite so we had a rather large room. I believe we paid $300/day and it was worth every penny. We will definitely return!
223,252,"Dec 1 2005	I like the Drake!!	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights in November (16-18). I was a bit worried after reading the reviews here and nearly changed my reservation but I am glad I didnt! The hotel is beautiful. The room was ok, but the bed was the most comfortable bed I'd ever slept in!!!The weather was incredibly cold, and snowy during our stay in Chicago but the room was just the right temperature!The location is ideal, right on the Magnificent mile. We didnt eat in the hotel, preferring to wander the street to see what took our fancy. (THe ole pancake house is worth a try!)Staff were friendly and helpful.I would stay here again"
224,252,"Nov 25 2005	Dowdy Comfort	Stayed one night seeing friends nearby and to experience &quot;high tea&quot; in the Palm Court Room.The room was average sized on the seventh floor, with a lovely view of Lake Shore Blvd. swinging around to the north and the beach beyond. The HVAC system is quite adequate, and you have to turn on the fan to get the solenoid valves on the radiators to open.The bed has very soft comforters on it and a simple silk sheet as a spread. The interior is very subdued and I felt that my grandmother (Drake no less) would feel very much at home here.Oh, and follow the warnings on the window latches and DO NOT open the windows. They are a &quot;break away&quot; types for quick evacuation in the event of a fire."
225,252,"Nov 21 2005	Bring earplugs!	What a disappointment for the price! Our room was on the &quot;executive&quot; level, had a great view, but was very small. Like others have mentioned, the bed has only a thick comforter -- no sheets or other blankets -- so you're either sweating under the comforter or freezing without it. The worst was the noise -- every time someone came in or out of a room on our hall, we could hear the door slam. Every time someone got ice (the ice machine is stupidly located right in the hall, not in an enclosed room to block the noise) we could hear it. At about 10:30 p.m., the people next to us started having a party. They were smoking, even though it was a non-smoking floor -- we could smell the smoke in our room. We called the front desk to complain and were assured Security would come up to confront the partiers, but no one ever came. (We complained about the noise from the doors and ice machine at the same time and were told, basically, &quot;Hey, be glad you're not closer to the street, because that's even noisier.&quot;) The partiers left around 11:30 (we were up till midnight waiting for the assistant manager to call us back as he claimed he would; he never did), but they returned around 5:00 a.m. and started their party again. We called to complain again and got nothing from the front desk except 50% off our room and an upgrade for the next time we stay (next time -- yeah, right).It seems like there are easy fixes they could make to reduce noise, but they have not chosen to do that. The staff we complained to said all the right things, but didn't follow through on doing what they said they would. It's ridiculous that they allow people to flaunt the &quot;no smoking&quot; rule.Aside from that, we had access to the executive club on the upper level, with free hors d'oeuvres and open bar in the evenings and free buffet breakfast in the mornings. It got very crowded and very loud, so it was not pleasant to sit there -- we ended up taking food back to our room. They were not very good about replenishing food on the buffet, either. We paid extra to have access to this amenity, so it was disappointing to not be able to use it fully.We ate at the Cape Cod Room in the hotel -- the food was quite good, but the decor is very tacky and not consistent with the high prices. It's also very loud, and the tables are rather close together. It's a seafood restaurant, but you can order from the menu from the hotel's steakhouse as well. They were very nice about letting us take our desserts up to our rooms, giving us real utensils and dishes.All in all, this was an extremely disappointing experience. For the price you have to pay, you should at least be able to get a comfortable night's sleep and be assured that a no-smoking floor is truly non-smoking."
226,252,"Nov 13 2005	On par with the best of the best....	After reading the reviews here, we were a bit skeptical... but the Drake's historical elegance, cleanliness, friendly service, and opulent furnishings were on par with the many 5 star hotels my husband and I have stayed in. The High Tea in the Palm court is a must for romantic couples or a ladies' gathering. The marble floors, 6 foot flower arrangements, fountain, harpist, 12 foot oil paintings, and classy furniture all work to create an atmosphere of tasteful wealth that you can't experience for the same price at the other expensive hotels in Chicago. It's right on the Lake, near all the restaurants and shopping, and the concierge was very helpful to help guests get on the right bus/train to go to the museums. We felt very safe, pampered, and not ripped off by their rates! We look forward to staying there again."
227,252,"Nov 4 2005 	Very good!	Great, clean room. Disappointing breakfast in hotel restaraunt. Get a room up high, or noise can be a bother."
228,252,"Oct 10 2005	Beautiful Hotel So-So Stay	The Drake is a beautiful historic hotel, no question. It reminds me a lot of NYC's Waldorf-Astoria, which is also now a Hilton property. The lobby, ambience, restaurants and stores are impressive, but the rooms--at least the standard one we stayed in-- are not. The room's decor was attractive, but it was quiet small. Our bed had a thick duvet and no other choices for blankets, so we were very hot! The bathroom was attractive, but it was really small, too. And the towels &amp; toiletries were disappointing. Basically, you would think the Drake would give you luxury, but it just doesn't deliver. We had a far more luxurious experience at the Fairmont in Chicago, which we had stayed at a few months earlier. So, if you want history &amp; ambience, go to the Drake. But if you want luxury &amp; extras, look elsewhere."
229,252,"Sep 17 2005	Sad disappointment	The Drake has such a venerable history that my husband and I didn't consider staying anywhere else for our first visit to Chicago. We paid $300 (with taxes) for a small room that looked at a wall. Whatever, we weren't planning on spending all our time in the room. However, the doorknob came off when we closed the door. The light in closet wouldn't shut off, shining into the room all night long. And there were no washclothes in the bathroom. When we asked for some, we were given one, as if they were being rationed. Oh, and the TV had poor reception. The doorknob and closet light were eventually fixed.The real problem occured when we came home near midnight to find our room flooded with water. The woman next door had fallen asleep while running a bath, and that water seeped into our room, soaking the carpet and many of our belongings. This isn't the hotel's fault -- I get that. However, their response afterwards was pathetic. They told us they'd move us to a new room, and send up a bellman right away to help. After a half hour, no one had arrived, and we were told he was too busy to help us. We went to the front desk to obtain the key to our new room, dragged all of our bags there, and then found the key didn't work. Back down to the front desk, where we were told it would take at least a half hour to resolve the problem. It wasn't until I pointed out to the clerk that it was 1:00 am, we were paying $300 a night and had nowhere to sleep and this was upsetting that she magically found another room for us. It's sad that a beautiful old hotel with the Drake's reputation could sink to such low standards."
230,252,"Sep 1 2005	Wedding itself wonderful hotel just O.K.	I was Maid of Honor at a wedding at the Drake in July, 2005. The handling of the wedding and reception by the Drake was very well done--food was excellent and staff (other than valet) were exemplary.The hotel/rooms functions were not so good. I was given an extremely unfavorable room, low floor overlooking a tar-covered roof with absolutely no view. I am from Chicago and used to seeing the spectacular skyline so the lack of view was not a big deal, but I did realize that I had one of the worst rooms in the entire hotel, which was dissapointing considering the rest of the wedding party were given upgrades and many of us checked in at the same time. Additionally, the bathtub in my room stopped up and overflowed twice in two days. My bathroom sink drained extremely slowly. My air conditioning only worked if I set the thermostat at 60 degrees (the average outside temperature was 95).The hotel despite being allegedly renovated recently, seemed very tired and dated. I agree with some other reviews noting a long check-in time. There were lines for check-in throughout the weekend. Guests at the wedding were subject to lengthy delays at valet parking also.The negatives at this hotel were mostly cancelled out by the amazing room rates obtained for this wedding compared to nearby hotels (Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Westin), however, it is sad that such a storied hotel seems to be struggling to keep up with the newer, nicer and much better managed hotels around it."
231,252,"Aug 23 2005	Outstanding Service Plus a Wonderful Hotel = A++	My husband, cousin and I stayed at the Drake in Chicago for a week. From the moment we arrived, the staff was over the top! The bell hop assisted us immediately. We checked in early, so our room was not available, but the staff graciously offered to hold our luggage if we wanted to get out to our shopping.We arrived back and found our room to be something out of the 1920's with moden day accessories. We were skeptical of the carpet since we had read all the reviews about the horrible carpet, but it wasn't so bad. It could be replaced sometime, but you really don't notice it. The room was decorated nicely, but because it is an old hotel and was very humid during our trip, the doors sort of stuck because of the wood expanding. The beds were very comfortable, even the roll away for my cousin. The service was outstanding! We had turn down service every night and even got a chocolate chip cookie for my cousin who is 15. The room was always cleaned as promised. We only had to ask once for extra towels, after that; housekeeping made sure we had enough towels each day.We did have to call maintenance once to get our refrigerator door shut. They were very prompt and attended to the problem ASAP. They were dressed in their uniforms and were very clean cut. We were impressed.I cannot rave enough about the concierge service. You tell them your going somewhere and immediately they hand you a coupon book of deals and free-bees! They were very organized and helped us handle a few side trips while we were visiting. Last but not least, my husband ordered me flowers from the floral shop in the hotel. They came just as we got to our room and were a beautiful assortment. I loved the colors and the size of the roses, about 3-4&quot; each rose! I expected them to only live a few days, but instead they lasted all week. What a wonderful surprise and a great deal since they didn't die the next day!Overall, I would say our experience was top notch. We love staying downtown in Chicago and I think we've found our new home!"
232,252,"Aug 21 2005	Nice hotel but dirty carpet	My room was large and grand, but the carpet was dirty in the room. The service was great, and bed was comfortable. But bathroom and carpet could use some work. Won't stay here again."
233,252,"Aug 2 2005 	A True Classic	If you like old-world charm and style, the Drake in Chicago is for you. The Drake is beautifully decorated and appointed. The classic architecture of the 1920s harkens back to a less-hectic time. The flowers in the lobby and elsewhere throughout the hotel were magnificent. The Cape Cod Room offers tremendous seafood dishes and the Drake Brothers has a fine selection beef. Enjoy tea time in the Palm Court while a harpist lulls you to relax. In the evening a pianist plays a wide variety of tunes in the Palm Court. The Coq d'Or is a fun place to go and meet friends for a drink.Even though The Drake is over 80 years old, you can enjoy the convenience of wireless connectivity in the hotel. If you don't have wireless capabilities, the hotel also provides high-speed internet access in the rooms.The staff throughout the hotel, restaurants and lounges are all pleasant and attentive which made my stay all the more enjoyable."
234,252,"Jul 28 2005	Gorgeous views are worth an upgrade. Romantic!	If you love hotels that represent the character of a city, the Drake is Chicago's equivalent of the Plaza in New York. Ask for a view of Lake Michigan and Wacker Drive. You'll end up in a larger room on a higher floor, and I promise you won't regret the extra cost. At twilight, when the city lights up as a cloud of fog rolls in from the lake, you couldn't ask for a more romantic sight. Our room was elegant, spacious and spotless. Service was formal but not stuffy, and the concierge was a wizard. Even the elevators are romantic. With loveseats, no less.The hotel's Coq d'Or bar was the first to open at the end of Prohibition and is still a great place to meet for early-evening drinks. The bar at the Palm Court feels surprisingly intimate despite being only a few steps up from the iconic lobby - which was decorated to the nines for Christmas, with carved Venetian angels near the ceiling and a magnificent tree. There are times when I enjoy sleek, modern spaces like the W or the Peninsula, but for an experience that couldn't happen in any other city, you can't go wrong with a lakeview room at this grand hotel."
235,252,"Jul 21 2005 	Low grade service at an High Class Hotel	I was at the Drake for a conference and the service was TERRIBLE. As far as the sleeping rooms go... The standard rooms were much smaller than I expected for the room rate we were paying. I did not receive my wake up call two mornings in a row. I was compensated with a bottle of wine in my room. BUT... I had to switch rooms because my toilet was stuffed up with a hairbrush from a previous guest. I left the water running a bit too long before getting in the shower and my tub nearly overflowed.The conference service was even worse. The hotel doesn't keep all the boxes delivered in the same place so it took almost two hours to locate anything. Unfortunately, the location can't be beat. It is right in the middle of the best area in town... decide what is important to you before reserving a hotel room.There were a few exceptions, of course. Jesse at the front desk was incredibly helpful! and the engineers fixing my toilet were very friendly!"
236,252,"Jul 17 2005	Disappointing.	We arrived five minutes after check-in time, but the room wasn't ready for at least another half-hour. There was an interminable line at the check-in counter, which really wasn't prepared to handle the quantity of guests that they had.Housekeeping was very disorganized. They were still making their rounds cleaning the rooms at 5 o'clock. When I got back from dinner at about 9, the door had been left open at the supplies station on my floor, with various cleaning products left lying out in the hall. There was also a bed (yes, a whole bed), sitting out half-blocking the hallway. It was there for at least a few hours, but gone by the next morning.The room had a somewhat pleasing &quot;classic luxury hotel&quot; decor, but it was clearly in need of renovation. The ugly green carpeting was really filthy, and in need of replacement. There was ample closet space, but only about four small drawers, which were in the big piece of furniture that also held the TV. The TV was mounted on a sliding platform that didn't slide out far enough, so that you couldn't rotate it to see the screen from the bed, or the couch, or anywhere else you might want to watch TV from. The cheesy simulated wood laminate that had been applied to this piece of furniture was stained in a few places, and cracked and peeling off in another. There was a safe in the room, but it was locked shut when I arrived, so I couldn't use it.The wallpaper was sort of old and faded, and, in one place, some crusty, reddish-brown fluid had been splattered onto it -- blood, perhaps? The bathroom had some marble in it, which was nice. The sink was partially clogged, and drained very slowly. The towels were thin and poorly absorbent, and had such a rough, uncomfortable surface that I felt like I might get abrasions trying to dry myself off.The worst thing of all: the noise! Besides a slightly annoying level of noise from Michigan Avenue, there was a locked door connecting my room to the one next door, and I could hear even normal-level conversation as though the people next door were three feet from my head. I got very little sleep at the Drake. Soundproof walls are my most important consideration in choosing a hotel, and this one was awful in that respect.On the plus side: The bed was very comfortable, with a wonderful down or down-like comforter. The air conditioning was plenty strong. Several concierges were excellent. And the lobby bar is a nice place for having a drink."
237,252,"Jul 5 2005	Beware	Impressive entrance. Good in-house restaurants w/thoughtful employees.Rooms - old style bathrooms w/really rough towels (prob don't get swiped that way); no sound proofing - don't rent a movie (since most movies have sudden loud sounds, neighbors will be pounding on the walls).When checked out, left items in the room. When back within twenty minutes. items had been taken &amp; turned into &quot;housekeeping&quot;. At front desk, they said that they would be brought to the front desk. After 30 minutes, asked again; told that they were on the way. After 20 minutes more, told the same again. After 30 minutes more, asked the exec whose desk is next to the front desk for help. He went to housekeeping and returned in 15 minutes with the items.If you ever need to pick up items left behind, DO NOT accept from the front desk that &quot;they are coming&quot;. Go immediately to someone with authority for help."
238,252,"Jun 29 2005 	Consistently Great!	I often stay at the Drake on business, and I've always had a wonderful stay. The rooms are always clean, comfortable and spacious. The staff is friendly and hospitable. The Palm Court and Coq D'Or bartenders are always friendly and accomodating. You can't beat the location, because it's on Miracle Mile and walking distance from the restaurants on Rush street."
239,252,"Jun 27 2005	old fashined elegance	we visited from scotland over memorial weekend and stayed in the hotel for 7 nights. we had an executive room overlooking the lake on the 8th floor. room was a good size, hubby loved the lay-out of the mini-bar, more like a little cocktail bar! disappointed the windows did not open as was advertised.window screens made the windows appear to be dirty. carpet in room was well past its best and appreciated the bathroom slippers as i did not like the idea of walking barefoot on it! lovely old hotel much better than a &quot;chain&quot; hotel. enjoyed the coq d'or bar were lovely food is served. staff all very pleasant. access to executive lounge on the 11th floor well worth the extra cost! they mixed a mean cocktail. staff there got to know you and were pleased to have you pop in for a pre-dinner apperitif. amazing views over the lake give this hotel a big plus factor.would certainly recommend this hotel for its old fashioned image and interesting history."
240,252,"Jun 14 2005 	Classic lines with a few wrinkles	RECOMMENDED. I'm only giving this AVG not because anything was wrong, simply that for the money it's an avg stay. As others have commented, this is an older hotel that has been renovated several times. Paint is thick on the wood from many years of service. Ceilings high from years were A/C wasn't invented. Furnishings of good quality but a bit worn. Check-in was prompt. Room was nicely sized, quiet, bathroom was moderately lighted with marble flooring. Basically the hotel is like a well worn shoe. It's certainly in an excellent location so if you get a good deal on the rate, it's worth a stay."
241,252,"Jun 13 2005 	Not a place I'd choose to stay	Stayed just 1 night for a business trip on June 8. They were out of King beds so I had the choice of a Queen or 2 Twins. I was told the 2 Twin room had a better view so I took that. I should have asked for the Queen since the &quot;view&quot; of Michigan Ave was really pretty boring, anyway, AND I could only look thru an incredibly dirty window which had a little note on the lock that said it was permanently closed. The bed itself was uncomfortable and lumpy so I hardly slept. The room itself is pretty small and a little dark with outdated carpet and bedspreads. Bathroom is also small and the shower curtain smelled mildewy. Towels very rough. Smelled smoke in my &quot;non-smoking&quot; room. Room is not real soundproof. Could hear lots of doors closing in the hallway at night. Didn't like how everything in the room, including the bottled water and the coffee, was an extra charge. Sure, it's a great location for shopping, but the Westin is 1 door down and they've got heavenly beds!"
242,252,"Jun 1 2005	Classic Hotel	We stayed at the Drake over Memorial Day weekend and thought it was a nice hotel. The location was excellent. The Oak Street Beach was just across the street and of course it was great being at the start of the Magnificent Mile shopping strip. The view was nice from our room - we had a lake view room on the 5th floor. The staff was friendly enough - especially the bell hops and valets. The concierge was very friendly and helpful also.We felt the room size was much larger than most chain hotels, but like other visitors, we did notice chipped furniture, wornout carpet and a worn bedspread. We also had a slight problem with room cleaniness - when we checked in we realized that someone had used the toilet and didn't even flush! That was unpleasant, but being so late, we just didn't really have the strength to complain and change rooms - though we probably should have. The only other problem we had was strange noises in the hallway, which we realized was due to a service elevator being across from our room. The noises did not happen during the night, so it's not like it kept us awake. Other than that, the shower could use some updating - we started running out of hot water after only 2 showers. We didn't try any of the restaurants located at the Drake, so can not comment on those. Obviously there is plenty of other restaurants in the area within walking distance.I don't mean for this to sound like a terrible review - we really did have a pleasant stay. I think one has to realize that this is an older hotel and appreciate it's historical value and classic beauty."
243,252,"May 27 2005	The Drake has still got it	I stayed at the Drake with my fiance the first weekend of May and we loved it. We were very pleased with the service, the hotel's old charm, the quality of the rooms and especially the location.We found the hotel was updated but the authentic feeling was not lost. The room, bathroom &amp; linens were comfortable and inviting.The only problem was the hotel was too close to some of the best stores, Chanel is right in the same building, Gucci and Vuitton are stone thows away, Hermes is just down the street ... very hard on the credit cards.We loved the Drake and Chicago ... would recommend it to anyone who asks."
244,252,"May 20 2005	Classic Chicago Hotel	We stayed at the Drake from May 15-17 and liked the hotel very much. The hotel has great history and tradition and displays it very well. Our room was comfortable although the plumbing was a bit old and the a/c a bit noisy. But those were the only minor quibbles we had. The staff is very accomodating and friendly. The room was spacious and the hotel was very quiet. Our king bed was very comfortable and we slept great. The location, at the start of Michigan Ave. is convenient to shopping and great restaurants. The restaurants in the hotel are superb, possibly the best collection in any hotel we've stayed at. We ate at all 3 of them, and liked the Cape Cod Room the best. The bar at Coq D'or is also excellent. We will stay at the Drake again next time we are in Chicago."
245,252,"May 16 2005	Don't let these negative people scare you away!	Stayed at the Drake for four nights and had a great experience. If you travel to Chicago, especially in the warm weather months, I can't imagine spending much time in the hotel anyway!! Staff was helpful and polite - although I didn't have many special requests except for a cot which was delivered promptly. The valet staff and doormen were excellent with directions, advice, luggage, etc. Just be sure to call down in advance (15-20 minutes) and your car will be ready to go. Rate was $129 a night prepaid - can't beat that.Great location on North Michigan Avenue! Shopping, Restaurants, Etc.Check-in was fast and painless.Bags were delivered to the room quickly.Valet was $30 / night Room was nice, clean, quiet, and roomy enough for two men.Nice bathroom with lots of room, good water pressure, and hot water.Lots of towels and nice bathrobes.View was nothing special from our room.Construction across the street causes some traffic congestion in front of the hotel.Bottom line: Beautiful hotel with great character and an attentive staff. It is not the Ritz or the Four Seasons, but for the price you can't beat it! There may or may not be a health club, and I can't comment on the food as I never ate there. The Drake is a perfect base camp for a trip to Chicago - hundreds of restaurants, bars, stores, and sites to be had within walking distance."
246,252,Apr 27 2005	Excellent	We spent this past weekend at the Drake and LOVED it! Excellent service all the way around from the front desk to the bellman. We had a deluxe room and was just the right size. We have stayed at other hotels on Michigan Ave and the rooms were alot smaller at the other hotels. The location of the Drake is perfect. We will stay at the Drake the next time in Chicago. We would not think about staying anywhere else.
247,252,"Apr 10 2005	Major disappointment	We checked into the Drake the last weekend of March. It was one negative experience after another. Check in person was cold to say the least. Seemed very bored and unwelcoming.When we got to our room we found that it had not been fully cleaned. The bed was made and surfaces were clean however when we went to the mini bar it was dirty and had to been restocked. There were black hand prints on all the doors and stains everywhere. The room was also freezing cold but the thermostat was not working so we called down to reception and asked for the room to be cleaned and the temperature to be adjusted. An hour later, plus three phonecalls someone finally came up. Room was cleaned but apparently nothing could be done about the heating. It had just been switched on and we were told it would take approximately an hour for our room to heat up.The final straw was when the people in the room next of us arrived. They may as well have been sitting in our room we could hear absolutely everything, word for word.Overall a very disappointing experience and definitely not worth the money. What you are paying for here is the prestige of the Drake and unfortunately they do not deem it necessary to invest in anything else!"
248,252,"Apr 7 2005	a once grand hotel is aging	the drake is still a chicago landmark and in the upper tier of chicago hotels, however the years have taken a toll on this once classic landmark. the lobby, though nice, is dated with carpet that needs to be repaired as well as main floor elevators that are also outdated. subtle things such as the paint in the hallways and the look and feel of room doors and design also need work. Paint is chipping off of the doors, the carpets in many hallways look worn and, in our case, the AC in our room did not work.Perhaps the biggest indictment of the drake is that it simply cannot hold a candle to the four seasons and pennisula hotels in chicago. A stay in either one of those hotels puts the drake to shame. This is important to note because the drake does consider itself to be a hotel of that caliber. While the name still signifies a classic, the Drake hotel has dropped in stature behind a number of other chicago luxury venues."
249,252,"Mar 27 2005	Grand Old Hotel	I read prior reviews on this hotel and almost cancelled my res.How glad I am that I did not. This is truly a beautiful hotel,the lobby has all the splendor of a Ritz hotel in Europe...The room and bath were lovely. We were on the 9th floorof the hotel with a fabulous view of the Lake.We loved the Club service and bar on the 11th floor. It hadeverything, including a great view.I will stay there again first chance I get. It is near alot ofbeautiful shops and restaurants...."
250,252,"Mar 25 2005 	What a trip	I just came back from a week stay at the Drake for a business meeting. I came back to my room the second day to find my room flooded. The pipes had burst and everything in the closet was soaked in brownish type water! This included my hanging clothes, coat, my suitcase, shoes actually everything but the clothes I had on. I was told they would send my clothes to an express cleaners but I did not get them back until after 9:00 am the next morning with my suitcase and shoes still missing. I had to be at a meeting at 8:30 and had nothing to wear but what I had on the day before. I was moved to another room which was noisy because the room next to it had flooded! Finally I was moved into a decent room. I had to go to the front desk numerous times and they insisted my suitcase was in my room and had to bring them up to the room to prove it was not! I feel they were only somewhat sympathetic to what had happened and that I was really just a bother. They did compensate me with a dinner, a breakfast and a movie. And that was only after I insisted because I was stuck in their hotel and could not leave to do anything. I had not coat and it was to cold to go out without out one. It was a very memorable visit."
251,252,Mar 18 2005 	This is a beautifull place!	This hotel is beautifull. The last renovations brought back glamour and magnificience to the grande dame! The staff is exceptional and trully cares unlike other higher end hotels. They will always go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying your stay! A very unique place to stay!
252,252,Mar 15 2005	A 'tired' beauty	I live in Chicagoland and have always heard that the Drake was the best of the best!! We were disappointed - My husband and I stayed for a weekend last month and the room was tired and rundown. The service was great but the room was dark and dingy....... Not worth the per night rate!!! Definitely needs a facelift.
253,252,"Mar 14 2005	A Chicago Monument	The Drake is a place you have to stay in if you want to stay in history. The hotel is an icon of downtown Chicago. When you walk through the revolving doors and up the stairs, you do sense a step back in time. Typical is the 19th century style chandeliers and interior decoration. I love places like that.Going to the rooms, you have the old fashioned elevators with built in couch and the huge wide corridors. This perhaps explains the rather small rooms, as the space used for the corridors didn't leave much over. The bathroom is another antique.This hotel is perfectly located, as you walk a short distance to places like the Hancock Tower, the Chicago river and Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile. This is a great place to walk around and if you want to take in a basketball game, United Center is a 10 minute cab ride away (until you meet the crowds then add another 10).All in all, the Drake is definitely worthwhile if you want to stay in a Chicago landmark."
254,252,"Feb 24 2005 	Drake: So-So	I was born and raised in Chicago and though out my life I was told The Drake was the best. I had the opportunity to stay there a few weeks ago. I was some what disappointed. The hotel services were great, but the rundown nature of the rooms (Soiled carpets, chipped furniture, and a general dismal appearance) left me wondering why anyone would stay there. I took into consideration the age of the building. It really needs a remodeling, not to change the character, but just to clean it up. Its a shame this grand hotel isn't so grand anymore."
255,252,"Jan 19 2005	A well-preserved treasure...	Stayed at The Drake with a friend during a bitterly cold MLK weekend. The beautiful lobby was a welcome warm respite from our walking and shopping adventures. The service is quality - the employees seem happy and proud to work there. We received kind greetings from all - the doorman to the restaurant staff and especially the housekeeping staff outside our room. Yes, our room was cozy - we shared a two double bed guest room. It was well-presented and clean. The bathrooms are functional - not spacious, but functional. I venture that some of the less-flattering reviews on here are from some that expect early 20th century charm to be upgraded to 21st century glitz. I'll leave the glitz to Disney. If you stay at this hotel you can be assured that you're visiting a piece of American history. Cherish it."
256,252,"Jan 7 2005	Exceeded our expectations!!	After reading some of the previous postings we were very unsure about The Drake, we had planned on staying only one night but extended our stay because of the great service and beautiful room. The front desk extended our stay in the same room at the same rate, booked on expedia with no problems at all. Unlike some of the other reviews, we had no problems with heating or water pressure. The location was fabulous for shopping on Michigan Ave. we were less than 5 minutes away from all of the great shops. Overall I would highly recommend the Drake for both short and long stays in Chicago!"
257,252,"Jan 2 2005	Hey let's not be so hard on the old dame...	I've noticed that online reviewers tend to be tough on the Drake. I think a lot depends on what your expectations are as you go in. We stayed there for two nights between Christmas and New Year's 2004/05. We chose it mainly on the basis of (1) location (we like to be on the Magnificent Mile) and (2) price (a rate of just $129 per night, found on a SideStep search). This gave us close access to the nice shops and restaurants we wanted to try -- and let us afford them! Yes, the Drake is very, very retro -- almost gloomily so in places. But it's also well-kept, and, at a third of the Peninsula's price (at least when we were there), a good deal. At the reception desk, we held out for a better room, and for a $50 nightly increase, we got a junior suite (very spacious, with a decent view, but the bathroom, though nice, was still small) plus Executive Lounge privileges, which we exploited to the fullest. We're in our late '40s, but given some of what we've been reading in these online reviews, we figured we'd probably seem like young'uns among the Drake's fogy crowd. Not so. We saw lots of young familiies, even 20-somethings. Actually, we felt like we were just about average in age here. Overall, a nice experience."
258,252,"Nov 26 2004	Disappointment	The lobby is gorgeous; the location is great, but our room left much to be desired. We had a junior suite overlooking Michigan Ave. The room wasn't big, but it was adequate. The bathroom on the other hand was so small there wasn't room to put a makeup bag on the sink. The dryer was wimpy, but the water pressure in the shower was great. The heater worked once durning our three day visit. The rest of the time our room was uncomfortably cool. The carpet was shabby which gave the room an overall rundown feel. Old world splendor leaves much to be desired."
259,252,"Nov 15 2004	Very Average	We were extremely disappointed with our stay this past weekend. Upon check-in, we were greeted by a shoe-box sized room. I understand that with the older downtown hotels, room size varies considerably, however at a rate of $300 / night I at least expect a queen sized bed. The thermostat did not work and the heat never shut-off. In fact, I would estimate our average room temp at 85 for the stay. The shower / tub did not drain properly. The actual tub was knee high with water by the time I finished a 5 minute shower. The building is historic and the location is great, however based on our experience, this is lucky to be a 3 star hotel."
260,252,"Oct 21 2004	Major disapppointment	We were hugely disappointed with The Drake. We stayed 3 nights in a junior suite at The Peninsula, but wanted to try the &quot;venerable&quot; Drake Hotel, with its Sinatra/Princess Diana/Heads of State history, and were looking forward to old-fashioned grace and luxury in place of the modern luxury of The Peninsula. Instead we just found the place old and tired. Our &quot;suite&quot; was clean, of course, but a bit of a bowling alley, long and sparsely furnished. Drapes on all six windows constantly fouled and wouldn't open properly, light in mini-bar closet was out and the carpet (and mini-bar itself) was installed so poorly it was embarrassing. Worst of all, however, was the hot water. It took literally 15-20 minutes of running the shower on full hot before the water was slightly warm, same with the bath. Someone appeared both times we complained but their answer was just that &quot;it's an old hotel, sir. Best to just let the water run and let the hotel pay for it till it gets warm.&quot; Practical advice, certainly, but not helpful, and a disgrace in a room for which they charge $515 per night (plus $38 valet parking, plus taxes, etc.) We commented more than once how our one-night stay at a Hampton Suites on the road passing through Ann Arbor MI was superior to The Drake in every way, for less than 20% of the cost.Our &quot;lake view&quot; suite was on the second floor - not much of a lake view from there, through the trees. Save your money and take a city view room, especially with the unco-operative drapes.The service was as good as you would expect, no better, no worse. Reservation staff was friendly and helpful, two concierges were excellent, one was just showing up. As this is written ( a week later), I have received no reply from the hotel to my comments which they invited. The Cape Cod Room restaurant was OK as well, but only as a late-night last-minute choice in a city full of fine restaurants. The &quot;Executive Lounge&quot; on the top floor was OK as well, but not even as big as our room.Unfortunately, The Drake's best days are long behind it (kind of pathetic, the fancy bound history of the hotel they leave in each room, highlighting its past glory that it can only dream of now.) Don't be fooled by the website photos of Princess Diana, etc. - now it's just an old run-down relic. The Drake could take lessons from The Royal York Hotel in Toronto on how to keep a grand old hotel grand. You want to stay in a first-class Chicago hotel, forget The Drake, stay at The Peninsula."
261,252,Oct 11 2004	Not so great...	The hotel is clean and quaint in that it has a lot of history BUT the service is terrible.We called down for items several times and nothing was ever delivered. We were promised a lake front view and got a view of the building across the street. We were promised two queen beds and got ONE queen bed and a cot. Luckily the serviceman got us a second cot. They didn't even bless us with blankets for the cots!Did I mention the service is terrible?I'm sure you could find a less expensive AND friendler place with the same kind of proximity to everything. I wouldn't stay again.
262,252,"Sep 30 2004	Only ok.	I took my mom to Chicago for a Christmas concert and shopping and had high hopes that the Drake would be the perfect hotel.Instead, they were changing the carpet in the lobby, so it was in disarray, the service in the cocktail lounge off the lobby was cold at best, the closet in our room had a scary hole (2 ft. x 2 ft) into some air vent exposed. The next morning, our breakfast service was spotty, the food was cold and there were crumbs all over my seat when we arrived. Yick. Other than a great location, I have few other reasons to return."
263,252,"Sep 11 2004	ok hotel	Hi all, I stayed at the Drake for 5 days and didnt like it. This is an old hotel with good history as Princess Diana stayed here and other royalties. It was built around 1930s so its old. Apart from that I didnt like the bed...always had a back ache after a night sleep. Room is adequate but the lighting is yellow lights so its kinda eeerie. If you're after an old hotel with european ambiance then its worth a try but if you are looking for more of a modern hotel there are others...I transfered to Wyndham and am happy (no more back aches) about it."
264,252,"Sep 9 2004 	POORLY MANAGED!	I hosted a group at the Drake in August. The funny part was that it was 10 people. The hotel staff were very rude with the exception of the valet staff, however I was double billed every day for parking. My group did not receive the correct food that we contracted each day. Nobody was around on the weekend to correct the problem so you were left hanging. I was charged for audio visual items that I never ordered. I complained to management only to receive a letter defending items that were never mentioned in my original letter. Also have left SEVERAL messages for the sales department, almost 30 days later no call back. I would steer very clear of this hotel for any group functions. They are VERY unorganized. The Westin across the street is ten times better."
265,252,"Aug 10 2004	Wonderful Place- 8/3/04	My husband and I recently stayed at the Drake for our 2 year anniversary. I could not have asked for a better place to stay. All the staff were extremely helpful and kind. We had a traditional kg. room, and it was very nice and spaceous. We were treated very well and would definately go back again."
266,252,"Jul 30 2004	Great Honeymoon at Drake	I reserved a room at the Drake about 2 months in advance and got a great rate through the Drake webpage reservation, other online services did not even come close. Had a lake view. The Hotel is very impressive. The flower arrangement in the foyer is overwhelming. The harpist at the new Drake Brother's Restaurant had us walking around stunned. Easy access to Wrigley via the EL, talk to the consierge, he is very helpful. Free City tram is great, use it, walked to Navy Pier and Hancock.Ate a meal next to the piano bar, requested a song, ordered room service, sent laundry out, free newspaper, let housekeeping turn down-leave you mints, bought the Drake complimentary robes,very nice, expensive but nice. Good lifetime memories. Parked car at hotel for 3 days for $33. Use public transportation, parking is impossible otherwise.Tipping works wonders, gets you extra little niceties from housekeeping and respect. Dress as you please, saw families on vacations and people on business. Going back for our anniversary for sure. Will spend more time on beach, ran out of time."
267,252,"Jul 20 2004	Grand as usual	Once again the Drake has spoiled me. This was our third stay at the Drake in as many years and every stay is just as delightful as the one before. This time I got a great deal for a room at $118. I figured for that it would be itty bitty and looking at a roof, but not so. It was very spacious and we did look at another building, but could see the lake to the left of our window. All of the small things are what I appreciate. The marble sink tops, the light fixtures, the huge towels and the textured sheets that are sandwiched around the blanket on the large, comfortable bed. The flowers in the main lobby are always fresh and beautiful. The front desk gal told us if we did'nt like our room, just let her know and they'll arrange for another. They managed to check us in early since we arrived earlier than anticipated. We were in our room by 10 a.m. We sat in the tea room for awhile before check in and that was very relaxing. The bathroom in that tearoom is like no other I've been in. Each stall is like an individual bathroom. The toilet paper and kleenex are always folded to a point no matter where you go. There is some magical fairy that has this job of making them pointed when your not looking. I never want to stay anywhere else when we are in Chicago. The Drake has truly spoiled me!"
268,252,"Jul 14 2004	Frank Sinatra's favorite!	Magnificent old Hotel. Sinatra's favorite.Staff is great, 4 restaraunts are great, water pressure is outstanding.Offered a $30.00 upgrade to room with sitting area per night. Declined but will take them up on that tomorrow night.Rooms are small, as to be expected in a historic hotel, but I'm sitting here surrounded by thousands of dollars of furnishings, wall work, heavy wooden panelled door, etc.This is a subtle but important note as I sit back and notice things. If I look around my room and ask &quot;could this be a guest room in a Southern Plantation, or Rhode Island Mansion?&quot; my answer is Yes. When I ask that at the Hilton/Hyatt/Marriott, my answer is No.Then I ask myself, &quot;how many days do I have on this planet? how many days do I want to be in a generic box?&quot;Internet is $11.40/day.View: Lake Michigan or City, ask at desk. I took the Lake, and have nothing between me and the lake but one road. No buildings, this hotel is on the lake.Large window says &quot;Caution Do Not Open&quot;, to appease the lawyers living amongst us. I slid the window up 4 feet last night. When was the last time you slid a hotel window up? Especially a new dark stained aluminum double paned window? No screws or restrictors. Gotta like a place that still says &quot;don't do that&quot; but lets you be an American with the choice to do so if you want.Phone system is nice. Set wake up call for 6:30am. Heard it, ignored it, rolled over. Went off a second time, ignored it, rolled over. Security knocked on my door 15 minutes later, &quot;Security, just wanted to make sure you received your wake up call&quot;. I was extremely impressed that they knew part of their job is to make sure I make it to my early meeting!The bar says they served the 2nd drink in Chicago after Prohibition ended.4 internal high end restaraunts.Right on the shopping wonderland known as the Magnificent Mile, across from Bloomindales.If you're tired of generic Hyatt/Hilton/Marriott experiences and want a change, try the Drake.Thanks to BiddingForTravel for allowing me to find out about this hotel!"
269,252,Jul 11 2004	our Anniversary	My wife and I stayed here for our 10 th wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to a sweet upon our arrival. The staff was wonderful.On our first night there wich was our anniversary we came back to our room to find a chocolate mousse cake that read happy anniversary!!! This was the most amazing hotel we have ever stayed at. We will definatley be back many years to come!!!!!!
270,252,"Jul 7 2004	Heart in the hotel	I like to express my gratitude to the staff of Drake Hotel, which I believe should be credited more than the &quot; famous lobby itself&quot;..The hotel has negative reviews about being an old one , but hey.. it is traditional hotel its not the usual hotel nowadays that is technology wise, the warmth of the hotel collided with the ambiance that I felt to be a royalty just like the service that Marc in the bell desk offered me, though its late at night he still went to wallgreens to buy a contacts cleanser because I forgot one. The clerk in the front desk ws very helpful in giving some alternatives to my room offering such upgrade and the concierge Adi should be taken in account for --reserving us a nice dinner to a very exquisite italian resto..Very good!!!!"
271,252,"Jun 26 2004	So-so	Attracted by an excellent discounted room rate, we stayed at the Drake and had Thanksgiving dinner there last year. People who pay in full won't get what they pay for.It was fun to be in the lobby of an &quot;older&quot; city hotel as opposed to the bland environment of so many chain establishments. Some Chicago businesses had advertising displays in cabinetlike niches. Uniformed bellhops bustled about. A towering, decorated tree heralded the holiday season along with an electric-train layout. The entire area was nicely paneled, carpeted, and appointed. Too bad we went upstairs.. The &quot;family room&quot; proved to have a good-sized double bed and nothing more for sleeping. (The couch didn't fold out.) Without our having to wait all that long, a surly employee brought up a cot which turned out to have a somewhat lumpy mattress. Fortunately we were only there one night.Space in the room was adequate. The mirror and glass shelves above the minibar provided a nice touch. The bathroom was roomy and clean. Furnishings were OK aside from the lumpy cot and cheesy radio. There was a decent view of Michigan Avenue to be had from the large windows.Dinner was served in a pleasing atmosphere with efficient, swift, and congenial servers. The food, particularly the desserts, was less than spectacular given the cost of the meal."
272,252,"Jun 15 2004	The Hilton sisters better focus on their hotel legacy instead of reality TV	Shock and disappointment is all I have to say about our stay at the Drake. We made a reservation two months in advance for a suite and a king room, we gave our credit card number at the time of our reservation (so that they could immediately charge us for the rooms-which they explained was a necessity so that we could receive their &quot;special&quot; rate -- how many other luxury hotels do you know that resort to charging you up front for a discount?) In good faith, we proceeded and were given a confirmation number. Trusting that the Drake was a reputable hotel with competent staff, we felt assured that our reservation was complete. The evening of our arrival, 9:30 in the evening, we were informed by the desk staff that our reservation had been cancelled. By whom? We had no idea, nor did they. We gave them our confirmation number and it was not accepted. The management was consulted, but refused to speak to us. The help was left to settle the situation. With few options at hand, we were forced to ask for any rooms available. We were given 10'x10' &quot;closets&quot; with views of the roof tops and pigeon poop. Not only were the rooms small, they had bath drains that did not work, complete with extra hair from the last guest to prove it, less than adequate air conditioning, that kept you up at night and sounded like the worst motel unit you have ever experienced, and finally, the towels were like rubbing yourself with dried parsley. We were never contacted by the management during our stay and at check out we were handed a bill that would have equalled ANY stay in the BEST room at a REAL hotel in Chicago. The end of my story is do yourself a favor and stay at the Ritz, the Four Seasons, or ANY other hotel that knows how to treat and respect their client."
273,252,"Jun 15 2004	Not so ""drake"" as Id dreamed...	We were a party of 6, in 3 twin bed rooms from May 29th to June 3rd. 2 rooms were quite OK but the 3rd was so small and facing a wall that we complained and after much begging were given a half lakeview one (3rd floor). It was unusually cold (20 less than normal) but the heating was off and the best they did was giving us very old and not so efficient small heaters. The inroom TV hotel services account gave each day a different and wrong total so we spent every morning half an hour waiting anc complaining to a most untypical Assistant Manager... no french, no spanish speaking. The public rooms are nice but not gorgeous. Best assets: housekkeping maids and buffet breakfast."
274,252,"May 22 2004	Upgrade your room....it's worth it!!!	It's very exciting to stay at the Drake!!! The lobby is very grand and you can feel the history as you walk in. The front desk staff is extremely helpful. We stayed for two nights and were disappointed with our room the first night. It was cramped and all we saw out our window was the wall of the neighboring business building. We called the front desk and she had nothing else available at the time but told us to call back the next morning for an upgrade. When we called early the next day, they said they had a Lake view room for $20 more. We decided to go for it and did not regret it one bit. It was on the third floor and had a view of the Lake and the road along the lake. It was very relaxing. It was also a much bigger room. Ordered room service the next morning to sit by our window and enjoy the view. The food was expensive by tasty. It was hard to say good bye to this room."
275,252,"May 11 2004	Easter 	It was everything I expected and more. The room was well organized, the food was wonderful, there were serveral staff members to assist with all of my needs, the dessert room was impressive and the desserts were definately home made. I had a wonderful time in a beauftiful room and would highly recommend The Drake"
276,252,"May 6 2004	Nice but a Bit Disappointing	I stayed here recently for 3 nights and liked the historical charm of the place. Rooms were a bit small and perhaps over furnished, but the high ceilings prevented it from feeling too cramped. I had no problem with the climate control in the room. The hotel is old but it seems to be refurbished and not at all run down. My nits: not obvious that there's an elevator from the street to the lobby check in (steps are daunting if you have luggage), and I couldn't understand why they had such cheap / poor quality radios in the room - really diminishes the place."
277,252,"Apr 11 2004	Great Location	Great Location and Great Hotel.... The staff was perfect and the location could not have been better.. The rooms were a little warm, the temp controls did not work that well... ( Opened the window and we were fine) Otherwise, perfect......."
278,252,"Apr 5 2004	Enjoyed Our Stay	My wife and I stayed at the Drake in Jan. and enjoyed our stay.The bad: The rooms are on the small side and the temperature controls in our rooms weren't working.The good: Great service, friendly staff, wonderful bar. Clean rooms."
279,252,"Mar 30 2004	Beautiful hotel!!	My husband and I stayed at the Drake for our 10yr anniversary. We stayed for 3 days, and the hotel is simply gorgeous. The staff works HARD to exceed your expectations. The hotel is lovely, and has beautiful showcases all through out the area called the &quot;Arcade&quot;. They have these GORGEOUS children's black and white photographs, and some paintings as well. We even used the photographer they have showcased there, and she is just as classy as the Drake. The Drake picked a wonderful choice there.This is a class A hotel. Our room was more than we could ask for. The hotel is pricey, but what can you expect in the Gold Coast?"
280,252,"Mar 28 2004	Great Hotel great location	Just returned from a 5 day break at The Drake. (13th - 18th March 04) We had a wonderful time. The accommodation was lovely - we had a superior view of Lake Michigan and the Gold Coast which was really beautiful. The general hotel appearance was like something from the 1920's. Sumptuous, with lots of attention to details (like a huge fresh flower display in the magnificent lobby, harpist in the cafe etc). Also, the staff at check-in and in the restaurants and bars (not to forget the room-cleaners) were friendly and efficient. It's location (right on the Magnificent Mile) couldn't be faulted - no wonder so many film-stars and royalty stay there! We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a stylish hotel with a glamorous past. Also, I'd like to thank British Airways for a super flight out and back and also thanks for the upgrade!!! Super flight, super hotel, super holiday."
281,252,"Mar 13 2004	meet my standards!!!	This might be very opinionated type as i discussed..but the employees not the hotel itself met my standrads and should I say&quot; offered me more than I expected...and I have to paved and recognized them-by doing so,It will give me a comfort of acknowledging the certain individuals that made me and my fiance vacation spree spectacular!!!when the doormanNEIL HANDED MEa ticket he was very generous to direct me in the lobby I was mesmerized that it was so busy and he still have time to show me where it is, I remember the receptionist Lorenzo who was extremely kind to give as a lovely room overlooking the lake (take note without additional cost ) and wish us for a lovely stay,then right after the bell hop guy Marco who informed us evry detail in room , He explained things prompt, we adore the coq d or-loved the concierge tom, who recommends a good dining place..OVERALL I LOVED THE EMPLOYEES!!!WHO OFFER SUCH A ABOVE EXPECTATION"
282,252,"Mar 8 2004	full of old world charm	Me and my partner stayed at The Drake for 2 nights in September 2003 on a stopover to LA, we had read the mixed reviews and decided to try it out for ourselves. This hotel is fabulous, from the moment we checked in we fell in love with her,ok the bathroom door didn't close but it all added to it's quirky charm. The bedrooms were fine and fresh fruit on every floor was a nice touch. We had a wonderful time and there is nothing quite like having breakfast overlooking Lake Michigan in the Oak Terrace. I would highly recommend The Drake if you want a hotel with a bit of character. We will return to Chicago and certainly stay here again."
283,252,"Mar 1 2004	NO that great	The Drake was an okay hotel..very old..I expected mote from this hotel , they need to renovate their rooms...service was great at the hotel..employees are very helpful though I would not stay here again..very disapponted with the rooms..we were given 2 full beds!!!!!!"
284,252,Feb 22 2004	Loved the Coq d'Or	I spent a few day at The Drake nad it was wonderful. My room overlooked the lake nad I had access to a special lounge on the top floor that served free drinks all night! I also ate and drank in the Coq d'Or and this bar was the highlight of my trip. Although 70 years old te ambiance and service is second to none. I would highly recommend the Coq d'Or for giant Martinis and great service. The Drake hotel is wonderful...
285,252,"Jan 8 2004	What a great hotel	Just stayed 3 nights at the Drake, 25/26/27 December and the whole place was beautifully decorated for Christmas. I had already paid for the room online which was just as well because I arrived at O'hare minus my credit cards!! I contacted the hotel and they agreed to pay for the shuttle from the airport until I could get my cards replaced. The assistant manager (Mario) and his staff were excellent thoughout our stay. Although I cannot comment on the restaurants, the Coq d'or bar had a great atmosphere and the food was good value.....again bar and waiting staff were terrific. One dissapointment was the lack of coffee maker in the room but then again the walk though the hotel to the complimentary drinks every morning was a delight. The hotel is in a great location just minutes from the Hancock building and Michigan Avenue and I would have no hesitation recommending to others.....especially when you can get rooms for as little as $99.00 a night."
286,252,"Jan 7 2004	RUINED OUR THANKGIVING HOLIDAY	The Drake is horrible. They ruined our Thanksgiving with stale food, horrible service. (&quot;Hey if you going to tack on a 17% gratuity, you'd better earn it) What's worse is the management has not been responsive to my complaints. That is a 5 star hotel? PLEASE....Make note, I am not the only one that has written a review like this for the &quot;DRAKE&quot; If you have a special occassion, don't depend on them to meet the need. DONT SPEND ANY OF YOUR MONEY AT THE DRAKE HOTEL. The dinner was HORRIBLE!We are also going to seek relief if they don't refund the money we paid for the &quot;meal&quot;"
287,252,"Dec 21 2003	Great Christmas Spot	I always wanted to stay at the Drake, because I've heard great things. It was everything I had hoped! Very classy. Great place during the Christmas season, because of all the beautiful decorations. Plus, it was great for us, because it's right on the north side of Michicgan Ave, so we can shop all day, then be right back at our hotel. The service was great, and they even gave us a free upgrade!"
288,252,"Nov 30 2003	Excellant value!!	Just had two nights at the Drake, had read many of the reviews from previous visiters and now see what some people complained about. Yes the bathrooms are missing a shelf, some views are not very good etc etc but if that is all you have to complain about then you need to take a good look at yourself! I just wish we had stayed a few days later as we stayed 19th and 20th Nov. The place is looking amazing with the decorations which were just being finished. The giant tree in the loby, the Chocolate Sears Tower and the Icing winter scene of chicago with all sweets....absolutely stunning. No complaints with the service, the room, the package we booked which included breakfast and tickets to the Art Institute. Enjoyed cocktails in the piano bar.. I cant think of anything negative to say about the place. Did not eat in the restaurants, for no other reason than we preferred to go elsewhere. I proposed to my girlfriend at the nearby Signature room restaurant on the 95th floor of the John Hancock building which the concierge arranged the reservation and confirmed with me discreetly. Enjoyed the whole experiance and am glad I did it there so we have somewhere nice to go back and remember. Would thoroughly recommend it to any friends or family, especially to go during Thanksgiving / Christmas."
289,252,"Nov 4 2003	Complete Joke	This is my fathers favorite Chicago area hotel, so I thought I would try it out while in the Chicago area. However, after thinking about the ol' italianate feel of the place and its location relative to what i was interested in, etc. I cancelled my reservation, favoring the Hotel 71, which is a pretty darmn nice hotel, and thus my problems with the Drake began. In a nutshell, they have nicked me for $200+ because they never gave me a cancellation number, and I didn't think to get one, I just figured that they would take care of it and didn't give it a second thought, until of course, my credit card bill came. So, I have been arguing with them for weeks over aq cencellation number they never gave me and I am at my wits end. In short, any place that gives such poor customer service doesn't deserve your business."
290,252,"Oct 23 2003	Not what I expected !!	My husband and I stayed two nights at the Drake. on october the 4th and 5th. We were expecting luxury (like at any Ritz Carltons for example) and comfort. We were astonished with the size of the room, the quality of the bed, no feather bed no feather comforter. The towels were small and old, the shower curtain looked all weary. For us the experience was a disaster we booked on the internet a king deluxe and we got a small room with a nice view. I left a long complaint and I am still waiting for their response. I called the front desk to complaint and they never payed attention to my claim. I booked and early check in and they left us waiting for three hours.I do not know why Princess Di liked it so much !!I certainly wont recommend it and stick to Ritz Carlton with my eyes closed."
291,252,"Jun 20 2003	The Best I've stayed at !	In April 2003 my friend's dad suprprised us with a trip to Chicago for her birthday. Upon our arrival, we got off the plane at O'Hare airport and boarded a taxi. While we were riding, my friend's dad called the Drake to see if there were any openings. There were. As we pulled up to the Drake my friend and I's jaws dropped. We were very &quot;Wowed&quot;. The bellman took our bags, gave a ticket stub and took our bags up. We walked into the hotel, again being &quot;Wowed&quot;. We went up the stairs to be greeted by a huge vase full of flowers! ( I stood next to it and it was taller than me, and I'm 5 feet! ) We turned and walked to the check-in/out counter. Check-in was quick. We were told we would be staying one the 1st floor ( one story up from Lobby (L) level ) and that our room number would be room 115. We walked to the elevators where another bellman took us up. The hallways were so quiet. We walked to our room, slid the key in and the door wouldn't take the card. After about 10 times we went and got someone. The housekeeping came with the master card. The door opened. They said they were very sorry and then left. We went to see our view: A view of Michigan Ave.! Our beds were great, and we had two beautiful marble bathrooms with beautiful soaps and shampoos. A mending kit and a shower cap. Even more. The bathrooms had a hairdryer ( I would pack a hair dryer, I have short thin hair and it took me about 45 minutes for me to dry my hair and when we had to go eat it still wasn't dry! )and an extending magnifiying mirror. We had a safe, an excellent closet, walk-in. When we opened the door to the minibar, our jaws dropped again. A stocked fridge, a trow-away camara, gummies, snacks, crackers, candy, etc..... The mini-bar came with a price list , whooow. $16.50 for a trow-away camara. We had to buy it because there wasn't a store that sold camaras until 15 minutes away! We only bought the camara. The tv was huge. We had wireless internet on the tv like the new Msn-Tv. You could access your e-mail for a fee. There is a neat book in the room about the Drake's history. Queen Elizabeth II stayed there! We had free postcards and stationary in our room. We went shopping. Our bags were taken up to our rooms by the bellman, we returned to a broken door lock again. Housekeeping came and fixed it again.Around 5:00 we went to dinner at the Rosebud Steakhouse, just a short miniute walk down the street. The food was great. Our waiter was Teddy. At the end of the meal I said my compliments to the Chef. As we were about to leave, Teddy brought out the chef, so I cound meet him and tell him personally. (I want to be a cook when I grow up. ) Later on we left to see the Lion King on Broadway around 7:00 We came back around 11:00. Our door was finally fixed. We ordered a sunday and a coke from room-service. The sunday was $3.00 and the $2.00! $! Five dollars total for a snack. Room-service promptly delivered it. We set the tray outside our room to find we we woke up and left the hotel to go home the tray was still there. We did have a free complimentary newspaper outside our door, through. I would love to come back to the Drake again, and you will love it, too."

1,255,Oct 8 2009 	Fabulous hotel and service	Wanted to stay downtown and the Peninsula was perfect. The room and view were fantastic. The service was impeccable. Every employee you passed genuinely greeted you. The management here clearly does a wonderful job. The only thing I would point out was that I emailed the concierge prior to my arrival for restaurant recommendations and noone ever responded back. Other than that the stay was absolutely amazing.
2,255,Oct 2 2009 	Great Room amazing bathroom	LOVED the Peninsula. Excellent Location. Loved the bar downstairs. The rooms are large and have every amenity you can think of. I loved the bench outside the closet for throwing suitcases. My son loved the fact that he could watch cartoons while taking a bath. They even gave him a little Peninsula bear to take home dressed as a bell hop. Will return.
3,255,"Sep 20 2009 	5 star Excellence in Chicago	If you can afford to stay at the Pennisular in Chicago, please do you won't be disappointed.Amer Express had a deal where you had a discounted room rate , free upgrade, free breakfast, one afternoon tea. I went with the Royal Tea which included champagne and caviar. We also had Sunday Bruch which was very nice. The Hotel is 5 star in everyway. The house keeping is &quot;ghostly&quot; where you don't see them but always see their handiwork. No carts in the hallway. The Spa was a pleasent experience where we had a couples massage. The service is so good by the time you hang up the phone for service someone is knocking at your door with your request. The rooms along with the view are wonderful however stay on upper floors due to the noise and cars on Michigan Ave.The service is so good while checking out our valet took our bags and even picked up a Chicago style pizza we had earlier ordered and met us at our car as we left for home dodging Oprah's 2009 season opening show on Michigan Ave."
4,255,"Sep 9 2009 	good chicago hotel at the right price	We normally stay at another competitor in Chicago. There was an unusually good special so we decided to try the Peninsula. We had a 1 BD suite. Views in this hotel are not as good as the FS where we we usually stay but we did have a nice view of Water Tower, and a little bit of the lake. Main bathroom is a little small, suite had low ceilings and the TV was outdated. Our mini-bar was not refilled during our stay once....no diet sodas after the first day. The restaurants were empty or having special events during our stay, so even though we were offered a discount we could not use it and try them. Hotel was nice enough to credit toward the stay. Concierges were very good at getting basic info, though they push the restaurant of a former chef that we thought was a poor suggestion. The bar is old school but really smells of smoke even though it is non-smoking. The pool/ spa is nice. The location is central Michigan Ave near the major dept. stores. I would return only if I found a great deal again."
5,255,"Sep 2 2009 	Superb in every category	I stayed for four nights in an Executive Suite at The Peninsula while visiting friends from my college days. This was my second stay at The Peninsula and it won't be my last. In addition to the stunning service and facilities, I was able to get a very decent rate under one of their summer specials.My room was extremely spacious (see photos)--separate living room, entrance hallway, connecting hallway, etc. One of my favorite things about the Peninsula is the amount of room devoted to dressing--plenty of closet space, drawers, and mirrors. The sound-proofing was superb--windows open you could hear sirens and all the other sounds of the city, but once they were closed there was no sound from outside.One of the most attractive things about this room was the bathtub with a window overlooking Michigan Avenue--I took baths just to be able to look through the window! The technology is, if anything, over the top--I counted six telephones or equivalents (like the voice-operated one in the bathtub) in the suite, two televisions, a stereo system, and the Peninsula-standard electronic control systems (see photo)--on one morning when I slept in light and housekeeping knocked on the door (a long way from the bedroom) I just had to roll over and hit the &quot;Privacy&quot; button on the phone--a light turned on outside the room and that was it.No complaints at all about this trip, but I do have two suggestions, both from The Berkeley in London--1) The deck chairs on the sun roof outside often appeared occupied even though no-one was there--it would be worthwhile to clean these more frequently or to put up a sign asking people to clear away their belongings when they were done so that more people could enjoy the sun deck.2) Shoes left overnight for polishing should be returned with temporary shoe trees."
6,255,"Sep 1 2009 	Absolute Perfection....Didn't want to leave!!	Hands down the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel is in a great location, the room was gorgeous and the public areas of the hotel are beautiful. The service is stellar. The hotel staff knows what you need before you even know yourself, but they do it in a way that is not &quot;in your face&quot; and too much. We went to the Bears game and the whole time I just wanted to get back to the hotel to enjoy the roof-top bar overlooking Michigan Ave. We finally made it back and the bar was awesome (not to be missed), and the staff treated us to complimentary champagne for my birthday. The next day I had lunch w/ a friend at the restaurant in the lobby and I mentioned to her that we were there celebrating my birthday (I don't even recall the waitress being w/in ear shot) but the next thing you know there is a birthday dessert served at the table. The waitress overheard me say we were there for my birthday. I cannot say enough about the wonderful hotel. I stayed at the Trump a couple of months later and let me tell you that it PALES in comparison to the Peninsula. Not even in the same league. If you can afford it, stay at this hotel when in Chicago. The Peninsula has won a regular client. Will be staying at the Peninsula in NYC soon, hope I am not dissappointed!"
7,255,Aug 18 2009 	A reason in itself to visit Chicago	Always perfect. Period. One of my favorite hotels in the world.
8,255,"Aug 11 2009 	The BEST hotel in America	This is my third, maybe fourth stay at The Peninsula Chicago. I would like to live there on a permanent basis. This was an important visit for me as it was a 4 day/3 night stay with my son before he departs for his first year of college, and I wanted it to be a special. The Peninsula made it an exceptional visit.We stayed in a &quot;deluxe&quot; category room, 1736, which was spacious and had 2 very comfortable beds. The room had a good city view to the west which is not THE Chicago city view, but it was still good. The room is over the top in every way. A large flat screen HDTV that pivots for viewing in the living area or the beds to go with a smaller set at the foot of the bathtub. The room had a double desk along with a full sized couch and a chair and ottoman. It also had 2 minibars so one did not have to walk far for refreshments.The bathroom is incredibly opulent and wonderful. Separate shower, tub, potty, 2 full vanities.The soundproofing is great. We never heard any noise from anything but ourselves and/or the tv or the ipod (the room has a loading dock) and a dvd player.A true luxury hotel, it does not nickel and dime you. Each night, turn down service includes a bottle of spring water for each occupant. There is excellent and free wi-fi. In the morning I received a complimentary copy of the Chicago Tribune, The NY Times and the Wall Street Journal.The fitness club which sits atop the hotel is simply stunning. It is extremely well equipped with a variety of new cardio machines/towels/headsets/water/etc. The swimming pool is gorgeous and it has an outside deck which affords some nice views.The Shanghai Terrace is a delightful restaurant and was a great place to sit outside facing MIchigan Ave for appetizers/cocktails and/or a full meal.We also availed ourselves of the bistro at the ground level which was also excellent.This hotel has no flaws. What makes it all the more exceptional is the staff. A guest relations manager, LeeAnn Brown, saw to it that we were set up comfortably,and took it upon herself to dig around the city for some childhood treats I requested (for me) consisting of the candy &quot;Chuckles&quot; which are hard to find these days, fannie may pixies, and Jay's potato chips, all of which are unique to Chicago. She went beyond the extra mile and had 2 white sox hats in the room for my son and me knowing we were going to a game. Upon checkout, she came out and introduced herself to me and could not have been kinder or more competent throughout. It is people like Ms. Brown that make The Peninsula not just a very good hotel, but rather, a great hotel.I look forward to returning to Chicago for its many pleasures but moreover, to treat myself to another visit at The Peninsula."
9,255,"Aug 2 2009 	Nice hotel excellent service but overpriced and overhyped	I stayed three nights at the Peninsula Chicago Hotel for a business conference. This was my first stay at a Peninsula Hotel. I stayed as part of the American Express Fine Hotels and Resorts program. I had an executive suite (no upgrade) and spent a great deal of time in the room working. Perhaps it was all the hype I heard about this chain of hotels in advance that truly raised my expectations, but I was a bit underwhelmed. Dont get me wrong, this is a very nice hotel, but there are areas that could use improvement. Here are my observations about this hotel:GOOD:* The service is, predictably, excellent. The very best. You are greeted by everyone with a smile. Responses to your requests are immediate. The housekeeping is the best Ive ever experienced. They are like service ninjas who somehow detect those rare moments when you may not be in your room and they make it immaculately clean within 10 minutes. Laundry as well was very quick. When I arrived at the hotel, my suit and a couple of shirts I packed were a bit wrinkled. They took care of them all within an hour. * Free wireless internet throughout the hotel.* The food was pretty good for the most part. The kobe burger was good, as was the creamless tomato soup. The afternoon tea service is great. * The fitness center was nice (not as large as hotels like the Four Seasons, which have a Sports Club LA in them) but sufficient, and very well kept. There were only a couple of other people in there when I went to work out, so I got to use all the equipment I wanted without a problem. * The desk in the room was good. I like a big desk when I travel for work. It gives me room to use my laptop, open up binders, and multitask. I was easily able to do that. I wish, though, that they would position it in a way that would allow you to take advantage of the views while you work. (See my comment below about how the bottom drawer should be used for a printer, not a fax).* The bathroom was very nice. Good standup shower and nice bathtub that overlooks the city. Having a small TV screen next to the bath was great as well. Only complaint in that part of the room was that the stopper in one of the two sinks didnt work and the water took a while to heat up. * The bed was very comfortable, as were the pillows. A+ in this department. BAD:* When I arrived there were two gnats in my room. Not a big deal, but I was surprised. One of them was killed when it took a nose dive into my soup at lunch (which I had fortunately pretty much finished).* The technology in the room is a bit outdated. True, there is the high tech control panel that you can use to change the lighting, TV channels, and air conditioning. On the other hand, there were no flat screen TVs in my living room or bedroom, no high definition or HDMI, no iPod radio, and the telephones (not portable) are old -- one of mine had to be replaced because it didnt work properly. Theres a fax machine in the desk drawer, but quite frankly I dont know of many people who use those very much  most communication is done by e-mail these days. The space would be better used by a printer. Theres a stereo in the living room, but it looks like something my father owned in 1980. * Prices were RIDICULOUS! I expected to pay a decent amount of money because this is a top notch hotel, but some things were laughable -- $13 for a cappuccino to be delivered to my room. Two course meal for one person - $100 (no alcohol). Spa was outrageously overpriced. * The room was not well insulated from the noise. I constantly heard sirens, car horns, and beeping noises from the street 11 floors below. I also heard when people above me were turning on their water. * There was a horrible air freshener smell on my floor. Its not throughout the whole hotel and I only traveled to my floor so I dont know whether it was an issue with my floor or all floors but it was clearly a scent that was there on purpose. CONCLUSION:The Peninsula hype I received before I arrived was a little too much. This is a nice hotel but Ill probably try a different one next time Im in Chicago. The service is excellent but the rooms are a bit dated, which results in some minor annoyances. More than anything else it is very overpriced. I realize that you pay a lot for a top flight hotel, and I'm willing to do that, but I think I probably could have paid less and received more at the Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton."
10,255,"Jul 13 2009 	Off the charts good.	This is a spectacular hotel. There isn't one thing I could complain about. The service, ammenities, location and room were all great. It is very expensive but you get what you pay for. Flat screen in the room, iPod dock, free wi-fi, the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on and one of the best showers I've ever had in a room. Everything is first class.I'm not sure I'd take kids here although there were some around. The pool is nice but mostly set up for lap swimming and there is a hot tub as well. Both are indoor."
11,255,"Jul 8 2009 	An enjoyable experience	I booked this trip at the last minute so naturally the rate was pretty high. I've read so many favorable comments about the Peninsula that I just had to check it out for myself. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The service I received from the moment I stepped in front of the hotel (greeted warmly by valet) until the day I departed was memorable. I am hooked. While there I visited the pool area and felt so relaxed I fell asleep in no time. The iced lemon water and iced strawberry water was a nice touch. Breakfast in the lobby restaurant was nice as well. I also visited the bar and received great service. The servers were friendly and offered great suggestions on where to view the fireworks. Fridays &amp; Saturdays the hotel provides live jazz in the lobby area where you can enjoy cocktails and meals. The lighting was perfect for the setting. I must say the thing that I like the most was the control box that is placed on the nightstand. You can control the TV, the lights and the alarm clock. No more looking for the remote. I must get one for my bedroom. One other thing that I found favorable was the fact that the hotel places your newspaper in a small handled bag which is hung on the door knob. No more bending down to retrieve the newspaper. The money was well spent. I can hardly wait to return."
12,255,"Jul 5 2009 	Best Luxury in Chicago	These comments are a year delayed; we stayed in Aug, 2008. Peninsula Chicago is by far the best luxury in Chicago -- perfect location, boutique-like stellar personal service, gorgeous spa, beautiful marble bathrooms in the rooms, traditional rooms with modern amenities and superb linens. Absolutely the best in five-star luxury in Chicago. NB: We viewed our friends' room at the Four Seasons Chicago and, while perfectly adequate for a hotel in general, for five-star, it seemed a bit stale and outdated; the common areas of the Four Seasons were unimpressive for &quot;five star&quot; -- if you're spending this kind of money, absolutely opt for the Peninsula vs. Four Seasons =&gt; no contest."
13,255,Jun 15 2009 	Well Located	Probably the best hotel in Chicago considering the location and quality of the property.
14,255,"Jun 8 2009 	Five star hotel of Palatial Proportions in a great location	This is with out a doubt the finest hotel in Chicago. Everything about it 5 star plus. My room was large, the windows opened so you can let in fresh air and hear the city sounds. The location is right on Michigan Avenue in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. There is a great reception area, a large lobby restaurant and bar, a caf with outdoor seating and everything else you could want. The indoor lap pool is huge, has a view from the 19th floor and has an adjacent outdoor seating/sunning area also with a spectacular view. The hotel lacked nothing. Everything it has is spectacular. And it was all priced accordingly, e.g. my room service breakfast of blueberry pancakes and coffee for one was $55. On the bright side the in room wifi is free and worked great. I cannot think of anything that was less than perfect. Needless to say I would highly recommend this hotel to others who want and can afford this luxury. One more note on the area-right across the street is the Rosebud Cafe with some of the best Italian food ever with large portions, reasonable prices and great outdoor seating. A must go to in Chicago."
15,255,"Jun 8 2009 	Best Weekend aside from our Honeymoon	I booked a Fri and Sat Night stay at the Peninsula for my wife and my 1st wedding Anniversary. To simply put it, the Peninsula exceeded our expectations of luxury, service, and relaxation. Check-in was fine, it is a nice touch for the front desk attendant to peronally escort you to your room, give you a brief tour, and inquire of any other needs. The Deluxe king we booked was very clean, spacious, and comfortable. The kingsize bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows and soft comforter.The bathroom was very large, marble everything, the highlight is the tv/radio controls for use while in the bathtub. The deep soaking tub and seperate shower have excellent water pressure and space for two.On Saturday night we went to the lobby for the Jazz at the Pen. The jazz quartet was very good, able to read and play off of the crowd.The spa and finess center were top notch. The pool is very nice and sun filled, there is an outdoor sundeck, but it can get quite windy 20 floors up.Room service, housekeeping, and the front desk staff are very efficient and accomodating.Our weekend at the Peninsula Hotel was arguably the best we have ever had, aside from our honeymoon."
16,255,"May 22 2009 	What a town what a hotel what a meal...	Great 5 nights at The Peninsular where the service was supreme, the room great, the location perfect and the food delightful.Ate the mad 15 course tasting menu at Avenues - little bit too much food for our delicate UK stomachs though the locals seemed to fare better!Great room service food and excellent staff. Concierges were superb and really did know where to go and what was what in terms of tours, restaurants and places to visit...Spa worked a treat - great views and great massage - nothing too much trouble."
17,255,"May 12 2009 	Excellent Business Hotel	You come into the hotel and come up one floor to the main lobby to register. The rooms are large and very well decorated with mood lights even in the bath room. The shower was one of the best I've had and the hot water comes on right away, with excellent pressure.The health club is well situated in the top floor with and indoor pool. The bed was outstanding, with very comfortable down comforters. Meals are a little on the high side, but very well presented, but with small portions. Meals are served in a beautiful lobby and a delightful place to hold a business lunch. Service in the whole hotel was excellent and lived up to the reputation of the Peninsular. It is well located opposite Saks 5th Ave, and half a block from the main shopping street."
18,255,"May 2 2009 	Fabulous Hotel - Absolutely Worldclass	My wife and I spent 3 wonderful days at the Pen Chicago. It was our anniversary so we received a double upgrade (one for Amex FH&amp;R and one for the anniversary). We booked a junior suite so we ended up in a deluxe suite.The room was very fresh and new looking. The furniture was in excellent condition, electronics were of the highest standard (Ipod ports at TV's, memory card ports at TV's, the usual Peninsula bedside console, DVD players and a TV in the bathroom). Kudos for the free wireless! The bed was comfortable with soft sheets, the bathroom was large with a big shower plus a separate soaking tub and the sitting area was spacious. The soundproofing in our room was excellent and the blackout curtains made for a great sleeping environment.Service was top-notch. The bellmen were fast and friendly. The front desk staff accompanied us to our room and were exceedingly gracious. Housekeeping was thorough yet almost invisible. The concierge made good recommendations about dining and places to see. The hotel arranged airport transportation which was flawless.Dining: Shanghai Terrace is exceptional for high end Chinese, I cannot adequately praise this place. Be warned it is pricey but worth it. Room service is both prompt and quite good albeit very costly. Pierrot the French cafe is ok and a quick place to grab lunch or breakfast.The Bar is always crowded and if I had one complaint we had a sour waitress the one night we went down who shorted me on my scotch as I received the &quot;last shot&quot; in the bottle. That was not an excuse for a short drink.On our anniversary the hotel sent chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of French Champagne which was unexpected and very nice. This hotel delivered a product and service at an exceptional level for the United States. As a very frequent traveler this hotel is among the best I have seen in a US city. Yes, it is very pricey but they deliver a top notch experience with great rooms and great service. The location cannot be beat either."
19,255,"May 1 2009 	Loved the Peninsula	Stayed here for two nights while visiting friends who live down the street. I had grown up having tea at the Peninsula in Hong Kong and wanted to check out a Peninsula in the States. It was really just awesome. Our room was in a lovely yellow and cream decor on the 16th floor. We had a standard room so it just overlooked the Park Hyatt but you could also people watch on the Mag Mile. Speaking of which, it is just outside your door. The rooms are quiet, with the exception of the Chicago PD and FD who seem to really like their sirens at night.Thank goodness we got a special deal on our stay because let's face it, this place is expensive, but just oh so wonderful. We ordered room service breakfast which came to $100 for two. Very yummy however, and even better with the Sunday New York Times delivered to your door.We also had afternoon tea included in our stay and it was just lovely. Service, food, atmosphere, musicians. Almost like being in Kowloon itself.Everyone working there was so gracious, at ease at serving and interacting with guests. No snobbishness, just pleasant, polite, attentive.Lastly, the pool was just really neat. Up on the 21st floor with a great view, lovely poolside seating and a whirlpool. Plus, we had the place to ourselves."
20,255,"Mar 29 2009 	Quiet wonderful luxury	Everything about this hotel is lovely without being obnoxiously so (well, ok, sending up a bellhop in an all white sailor suit with white gloves to deliver a grimy fedex package was farily silly but I'll overlook that). Had the most relaxing two day hotel stay and I'll def stay here aging if only for the assurance that a pair of fresh padded slippers, a plush robe, and the best bath towels I've ever encountered will be waiting for me. (Also really like that they have a push button system that declares your room off limits to housekeeping until you push another button that asks for them to make up the room.)"
21,255,"Mar 15 2009 	Beautiful but exorbitantly expensive	I stayed at The Peninsula for three nights in August. The room was on the 15th floor, somewhat near the elevator, but wonderfully quiet and luxurious. The staff were exceedingly polite, but forgot to retrieve the room service cart, sometimes for hours. Having to take two elevators to get to my room was a bit of a hassle as well. The room service food, and the food in the Lobby, was not worth the money- don't eat in the hotel, go elsewhere. Extremely expensive- but if it's no object and you want a gorgeous, quiet and comfortable room, then go for it."
22,255,"Mar 10 2009 	Completely Over-rated	This hotel is completely over-rated. The staff was mediocre, the rooms had an odd odor. I've stayed at much nicer, actual 5 star hotels. This was not one of them. Maybe it works for Chicago, but I'd rather stay at the Four Seasons, Ritz, or the Park Hyatt. Really, don't believe the hype."
23,255,"Mar 8 2009 	Wonderful Family Trip	Amid comments of, why are you going to Chicago in March?, I planned a short trip and booked a room at the Peninsula. My wife and I were accompanied by our two children . Our son is aged 5 and and our daughter is aged 18 months. We had never been to the Peninsula before, but its reputation convinced me to stay there. I arranged through the hotel to have a car to meet us at the airport upon our arrival. Inside the terminal a man was waiting for us holding a Peninsula Hotel sign. He greeted us and led us outside to the waiting car. Our car was a black Lincoln stretch limousine. My son loved the car and the driver whisked us away from the airport for a relaxing ride to the hotel. We pulled up to the hotel which is guarded by two very large oriental lion statues. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman named Timothy. He took my name and said our bags would be delivered to our room shortly. We proceeded inside the hotel and took the elevator to the lobby to check in. We were greeted warmly as we completed our check in. The Lobby Restaurant room was near the elevators and it is just as stunning in person as in all pictures I had seen of it. The friendly woman who checked us in led us to the elevator and took us to our room on the twelfth floor. We had booked a junior suite #1217 because we needed the space. The room was done in shades of yellow and gold. The truly great hotels always do the little things that set them apart and the Peninsula accomplished this brilliantly. On the cocktail table in front of the sofa in the living room was a paper model of a 1956 light blue Ford Thunderbird convertible. Inside the seating compartment was a linen napkin wrapped around two chocolate chip cookies. Next to the car was a martini glass filled with gummy bears. Next to the martini glass was a small teacup and saucer and a small silver spoon. Inside the teacup was orange gelatin. There was also a beautiful purple box of Vosges Haut-Chocolat exotic truffles on the desk. The room looked out onto N. Michigan Avenue and the large window made the view exceptional. The room was spacious and inviting. The next wonderful detail that the hotel accomplished still puts a smile on my face. In the closet were robes for us to wear while we relaxed. There were two adult robes and two robes for the children. The robes for the children had hoods and were sized so as to fit them each perfectly. We got some great photographs of the kids in those robes. The room was equipped with consoles by the bed that controlled all the environmental adjustments for the room. The bathroom was gorgeous and well-equipped. There was a television that could be viewed while bathing in the bathtub. The kids loved watching TV while taking their evening baths. Turn down service was completed every evening much to our satisfaction. We had lunch at the french bistro connected to the hotel. The food and service were both excellent. After our visit to the observation deck of the Sears Tower, we returned to the hotel and had dinner at the Lobby Restaurant. This restaurant is a gorgeous palatial space. The food was wonderful as was our server Don. I enjoyed a Peninsula Martini and my wife enjoyed her Blood Orange Martini. After dinner we retired to our room and I slept deeply on the very comfortable bed. The next morning, I watched the kids while my wife indulged in a swedish massage at the Spa. She said Donald did a great job. After that we all had breakfast in the the french bistro and headed out to see some of the culture of the city. We took the kids to the Science and Industry Museum, Millenium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago. The weather was cooperative with the temperature in the mid to upper 40's and mostly sunny. The Cloud Gate was fun to see in person. Upon our return to the hotel, my son and I enjoyed the pool and the hot tub before we went to dinner. What a scenic setting to swim laps. I loved it. I wanted to try Chicago style pizza on our last night so I phoned the Concierge and she recommended either Gino's East or Giordano's. Since we had the kids, we chose Giordano's because it was right across the street on North Rush Street. We ordered the stuffed pizza and it was incredibly good. I was raised on the thin crust pizza of New Haven, Connecticut but I got to tell you, the stuffed pizza here, while different ,was every bit as enjoyable as any pizza I have ever had. After dinner we retired to our room, bathed the kids and fell asleep. The next morning we had an early breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant. Again, the food and service were excellent. We returned to our room and collected our luggage and proceeded to check out. I used the express checkout method and we took the elevator to the ground level. Timothy the doorman saw us off and our limousine returned us to O'Hare for our trip home. What a fabulous stay at the Chicago Peninsula."
24,255,"Mar 7 2009 	One Word: Perfection	I had purchased a ticket to the closing night performance of my favourite opera at the Chicago Lyric Opera. I chose the Peninsula as I only had a one night's stay and I wanted to assure I was well taken care of. I debated back and forth with myself between the Ritz Carlton and the Peninsula and finally decided to give the Peninsula a try. Previous stays at other Ritz locations have left me feeling dizzy with the over-the-top attempt at opulence. With the Peninsula, the mantra appeared to be &quot;less is more&quot; and I was not disappointed.The hotel arranged a driver who met me at the airport with sincere smiles and an immaculate sedan featuring the Peninsula's signature magazine, bottles of signature mineral water and various snacks. Upon arrival in Chicago, I was treated regally from everyone from the driver to the concierge. I was shown to my room by the warm and gracious young lady who checked me in at reception.Because I was only staying one night, I opted for a regular king room rather than a full suite. The room was well-appointed with the understated elegance for which I had hoped. Rather than showy opulance, everything about the room (and indeed, the entire hotel) boasted understated sumptuousness - everything whispered plush without screaming pretention by shoving wealth in one's face. My fifteenth-floor room had a beautiful view of the Magnificent Mile. In addition to the standard amenities, the room offered incredibly plush bathrobes to be enjoyed in the state-of-the-art bathroom. The ice bucket had been filled and two bottles of the hotel's signature mineral water were waiting for me upon arrival. Everything from the bedroom's plasma television to the bathroom's whirlpool tub with built-in entertainment center was of the highest quality.Upon return from the opera, the hotel staff had performed a discreet turn-down service, in addition to cleaning the bathroom and refreshing the toiletries. Embroidered slippers and a clean bathrobe had been laid out for my ease. The ice bucket had again been filled and two more bottles of water were left.I had chosen the full Chinese breakfast as room service and it was delivered on time and warm. The food was absolutely delicious - If you try nothing else during your stay, choose the Chinese breakfast - You will not be disappointed.Due to weather conditions, my flight was delayed and I needed to stay an additional five hours until the car would deliver me back to the airport. The same young lady who checked me in greeted me warmly by name as I walked to the reception desk to discuss an extension for a late check-out. She re-arranged the driver and obtained a selection of spa services while I waited for my rescheduled flight.Overall, I was extremely impressed with the warmth and classic luxury of the Peninsula. Everything and everyone was the epitome of what true class is. The Ritz has just lost a customer."
25,255,"Jan 10 2009 	impeccable	everything was great, food, room, service, concierge. i would definately recommend it."
26,255,"Jan 8 2009 	Not my cup of tea.	My family and I visited the Chicago for a few days after Christmas, and for the most part we enjoyed our stay at the Peninsula.Upon entering the hotel, you take an elevator to get to the lobby and then another elevator to get to your room. The elevators were quick, but give yourself a few extra minutes to get downstairs if ever in a hurry while staying there.Our room was on the 11th floor and had excellent views. My family of four shared two bedrooms which were separated by a parlor that had a desk, couches, TV, and a half bathroom. The bedrooms were average in size and dcor and generally underwhelming. The bathrooms however, were fabulous. There was a television above the bathtub, and ample space to get ready. The hotel supplied Molton Brown products as well as toothbrushes, razors, sewing and nail kits, etc.Beds were comfy, and free bottles of water piled up after turndown.My major qualm with our room was the technology. I was under the impression that everything would be very high tech and sleek and it just wasnt. The bulky control centers were confusing and outdated. And the plasma TV and DVD players I thought I was getting were clunky and old. I think its time for an upgrade.The service was mediocre at best. While everybody was polite, I felt as if the Peninsulas employees were only greeting me because it was their job to do so, not because they cared about me. Several times I had to be the person who initiated the hello or good morning. I dont expect to be waited on hand and foot, but the occasional feeling that the concierge or front desk or dining room servers were happy to see me would have been nice.In terms of hotel food, the room service was average. My family ordered some snacks one day and nothing was exceptional. Breakfast at Avenues was delicious, but nothing I couldnt get at any other fine hotel. I do not recommend tea. The tea was ok, but the food was horrible. I dont think I enjoyed a single thing, and there was plenty to choose from.The thing that I liked best about the hotel was its location. All of Chicagos highlights, including the shops on Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier, are just a walk away. Theres plenty to do, see, buy and eat, and no need for a taxi or rental car to get there.I absolutely love Chicago, and its hard to fault the Peninsula for making my time less fun filled, because it most certainly was. However, next time, Ill opt to stay at the Drake or the W Lakeshore, where I can get a little more bang for my buckand a little personality."
27,255,Nov 10 2008 	i would stay here again	the hotel was great. the room was great. the food was great. the pool was great. the service was great. i would stay here again.
28,255,"Oct 16 2008 	loved the Peninsula	Wonderful stay, pure luxury, excellent service, we will go back"
29,255,"Oct 13 2008 	Excellent hotel with great food	I stayed at the Peninsula Chicago for two nights in October 2008 while on business. Had a room on the 15th Floor with views of the Water Works. Everything about this property was wonderful. The lobby and conference areas were beautiful and put together really well to host a large event with multiple meetings. The quality and selection of food made attending meetings a real treat, and room service, salads and burgers at least, were great. Now for the room: it was huge! The bathroom had its own couch! Excellent desk and business set-up with extremely comfortable bed. I don't even think I used every piece of furniture in the room it was so big! Can't beat the location either - you're literally steps away from Michigan Avenue shopping and world famous pizza."
