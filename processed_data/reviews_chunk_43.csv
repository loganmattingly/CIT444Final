34,993,"Jun 21 2007 	Bad experience	My husband and I reserved a room for 7 nights at the Hotel New England in London after reading very favorable on-line reviews of this hotel. We liked the location, near Victoria Station, and the fact that the hotel was non smoking. We anticipated a small, attractive and clean hotel, with buffet breakfast. We found the hotel quite attractive on the outside but cramped and dirty on the inside. The carpets were in terrible shape, dirty and worn and stained, the beds were mediocre, the bedspreads were stained, and there was not a buffet breakfast, only toast and a choice of a fried egg with bacon or cornflakes, served in a small basement breakfast room. The cost was 89 pounds on a weekend night and 95 pounds during the week. The unpleasantness of the hotel negatively affected our impression of London, so after two days we decided to change hotels. We advised the hotel that we would be checking out the next day. The hotel penalized us for insufficient notice and charged us for one night that we did not stay in the hotel. I would not recommend this hotel."
35,993,"Jun 16 2007 	Nice London Hotel Good Price!	After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I felt like I had a pretty good handle on what to expect at the New England Hotel, and it was all very accurate. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially Angie. She helped us decide what to do our first night there, recommending Picadilly Circus/Leicester Square to us, and it was good advice! We had a great time.The room was a little on the small size, but expected with a London hotel, especially in this price range. Four of us (two couples) stayed for 4 nights in a family room with 2 double beds for ?140 per night. It was a little bit of a squeeze, but very manageable. The hotel is very clean and the staff is very willing to give you fresh towels and things when you ask for them. Our window opened and we had a fan we could use, although the weather was a little on the cooler side and we didn't need it. The breakfast was just what we needed to get going in the morning- nothing heavy, but simple and delicious. We had our choice of cornflakes and toast or bacon, eggs and toast with juice and tea or coffee. As everyone has said, the location is fantasic. There are quite a few restaurants, shops and grocery stores nearby, and the Victoria train/tube station is only a 5-10 minute walk. We used the tube quite a bit with our Travelcards (highly recommended, by the way- the Travelcard- if you are spending any time in London at all) from Victoria, and it was the perfect location to be in. Overall, we were all very satisfied with our stay here. We felt safe at all times and enjoyed this hotel as our London base."
36,993,"Jun 15 2007 	Excellent stay	I needed to book a family room for my sister, my elderly dad and my young daughter. Booking a reservation through email was very easy andthe replies to all my queries were very efficiently dealt with. The hotel is security wise, not a problem. The entrance door is controlled from the reception counter and the hotel is monitored using CCTV. The room door used an electronic lock and the door is very secure. The room though simply furnished was in good order. The housekeeping was no problem at all. The staff, Jay and his sister Anjie are excellent. I found them very helpful and warm. They have been in the business for a long time and their advice always useful.The location of the hotel is very convenient; near the Victoria Underground and the Victoria Coach Station. Due to the location, travelling around Central London was not a problem for a first timer like me. I had no difficulties catching a cab near the hotel or directing them to the hotel. Coming from a very safe Singapore, I did not at any time feel unsafe in the surroundings of the hotel. There were many eateries nearby. I also did not have any difficulty obtaining groceries and other miscellaneous items from the nearby shops.Given that the hotel was suitable for an elderly man and a young girl of 5, I am sure families will not have a problem if they chose a room at New England."
37,993,"Apr 26 2007 	A fine establishment!	Everything was very nice at the New England Hotel. We heartily recommend the hotel to anyone who asks. Nice, clean, well kept, secure rooms at a reasonable London price. The elevator is a great plus, for those of us getting on in years multiple flights of stairs can be painful! Jay and Anjie are friendly helpful hosts.We really liked the location as well, and we so enjoyed the dinners we had just a couple of blocks down the street. The New Jomuna Indian restaurant and the Cyprus Turkish restaurant were very good and so convenient. Great memories."
38,993,"Apr 12 2007	Smiley faces make you feel like home:)	You want to stay in the center of London, but you want the hotel to be located in the safe and calm place? You want to get a delicious breakfast in the morning? You want a supermarket to be located nearby the hotel? You are not ready to walk more than 10 min to get the bus, coach or train? And the most important, every time you come back from the long walk you want to see the sincere smiley face making you feel so welcomed and long-expected? It means New England Hotel is really your place to stay in London:)"
39,993,"Dec 1 2006	Pleasant welcome clean warm and pretty breakfast room.	I recommend this little hotel, just 5mins walking distance to Victoria Coach and Train stn. Perfect for business trips - the hotel is clean (sounds obvious but...), warm, safe and practical. Family run B&amp;B hotel, where owners are polite and welcoming. Oh! And reasonably priced!H,Nov.06."
40,993,"Nov 23 2006 	Repeat customer.	As an mature female traveller who sometime needs &quot;affordable&quot; accomodation in central London between ventures I find this hotel meets all my needs. The location is good and safe even very early in the morning and late at night. The &quot;complimentary&quot; light breakfast offers a good start to the day. Dead easy walk to Victoria trains, tube and coach station. Many quaint little cafes and shops and even market stalls in surrounding streets. And of course not forgetting a large Sainsbury&quot;s just around the corner. There is also another smaller Sainsburys within Victoria Station complex. Remember we are talking central London, so even if the rooms are small the price is good for what you are getting and where else would you get a free breakfast thrown in for goodness sake."
41,993,"Nov 7 2006	A clean place to sleep	The hotel is a ten minutes walk from the underground and buses at Victoria Station. We had two rooms (one twin and one tripple) that were small but clean. The beds were comfortable but the pillows a little too hard and the blankets didn't look too clean.The breakfast was insufficient but quite okay. We would have liked a buffet, even though it's nice to be served.Since our stay was in November we had no problems with hot summer nights and our room had two mirrors (including the one in the bathroom).Overall we think that the New England Hotel is a good budget (?) alternative if you're looking for a clean place to sleep in the expensive city of London."
42,993,"Sep 30 2006	Great little hotel	Great little hotel for trying to find something affordable in London for the budget traveller. They had a hot breakfast which was okay, and its a good safe location near Victoria station. Rooms were small but nicely decorated and clean. Angie and Jay at the desk were really nice."
43,993,"Sep 29 2006 	Perfect location--Great stay	We just returned from this hotel and had a wonderful stay. It is a ten minute walk to Victoria station, Gatwick express, and Original Tour Bus through a quaint little neighborhood with local pubs and restaurants. The room was typically small and clean. Our day started off with a plentiful breakfast, and the staff, especially Angie was very helpful to us. We will be back again!"
44,993,"Sep 28 2006	Totally overpriced and its not even that expensive!!	We knew this was not going to be the most luxorious of hotels judging from the price and the photos we had seen. But this hotel really is not worth the price!There are other hotels in London that are the same price and are leagues better! If the New England were charging 65 a night I could not complain but I have got to know other hotels in London, in a similar location that are so much better. The plus side were the fluffy white towels, although these are not changed every day...we did ask for more and were provided with them straight away. There are no tea making facilities but again, we asked and the staff were polite, providing us with a kettle and 2 mugs. Carpets felt grubby and our room was tiny, hardly enough room to get around the beds.Breakfasts are really poor, just cornflakes or a cooked breaky which was average, no fruit or anything else. we didnt even bother on the second morning.You will be disappointed, its cheap (ish) but trust me, you'll find better!"
45,993,"Sep 20 2006	Good location; helpful owners/staff	We recently stayed at the New England Hotel for three days. It was our first trip to London. We were given a very pleasant greeting upon arrival and lots of local information and advice. Angela and Jay were always helpful as we departed and came back to our room each day. The room was very small, but I understand that this is common in London. It was clean, the TV worked well, and we had everything we needed. The simple breakfast also provided a good start to the day. The hotel has an excellent electronic key system and a lift to serve the higher floors. We found the location to be great for arrival and departure at Victoria Station, and for exploring London."
46,993,"Sep 5 2006 	Not Good	Great Location, only 10 mins from Victoria. We stayed here in August, and there was no Air Con- Very warm but we had fans supplied. The Bathroom was tiny, with a towel covering some kind of pipes near the floor- disgusting!Place needed a good hoover- very dusty.There was no mirrors at all in the bedroom, so after a shower you had to wait for the mirrors to de-mistfy- not grt when 3 girls are sharing!!Arriving back after a hard days shopping it wasn't great to find a black bag of rubbish ( from all the other bedrooms) in the middle of our room. We also noticed we had got 2 clean towels between the three of us. One of which we had to ask to be changed because it was dirty. When we asked at reception for sufficient towels, we got the reply; &quot; Oh, you want clean towels every morning?'- considering it was August, and we were taking at least 2 showers a day.....!?!?!?!Check out is at 10am- which sucks. Our phone rang at 10.05am- telling us to check out. When we left at 10.20am , the whole family- (Granny, Granddad, etc!!!) was standing outside our room- staring at us, big time.Would not recommend this place, nor would I ever stay here again!!R.S.D. - Ireland"
47,993,"Aug 30 2006 	Jay and Anjie Extraordinaire	Jay and Anjie were so helpful while we were in London staying in this family owned B&amp;B. We stayed here a week and they were always polite and helpful with travel advice, money exchange, and directions. The rooms were comfortable and clean. Location was great and close to grocery, Victoria Station and Coach station. Only wish breakfast was earlier as we started our day before it was served at 8:00-9:00. Would recommend to anyone staying in London and will return next visit."
48,993,Aug 2 2006	Convenient London Location	The New England Hotel is family owned and opperated. Located near Victoria Station it is convenient to shops and pubs. Our room was en suite and while it was very small it was clean. The breakfast was good and the staff were most accommodating. Jay and his family have owned the New England for 25 years and their pride showes in their care and service. The only points of concern are the noise and there is no air conditioning. (We visited in July and it was hot.) Bring ear plugs and hope for mild temps.
49,993,"Jul 24 2006	Central to Everything	Within walking distance of most of the major attractions. Victoria Station with its central line and District line offer direct access to those you cant walk to.The staff is friendly and helpful. The beds and bath are very clean.The only drawback (its a tradeoff for the great location) is the traffic noise from the street  its a very busy area. If you are used to street noise a first floor room will be fine, if you prefer a bit more quiet ask for a room higher up or on the Warwick Way side."
50,993,"Jun 20 2006	A Pleasant Stay	On our way home from Madeira, we stayed three nights in February at the New England Hotel. We chose it because the prices were reasonable and it was close to Victoria Station and the Gatwick Express. We were glad we did. We especially enjoyed the good service and friendly staff. We will make it a point to stay there again when we are in London."
51,993,Jun 16 2006	one night visit	I stayed at the New England Hotel with my teenage daughter for a theatre trip visit.We were very pleased with the room. It was very pleasantly decorated and clean and the beds were comfortable. The reception staff were most helpful.
52,993,Jun 12 2006	My London Home	The New England is a first class hotel with friendly and helful staff. The rooms are superbly clean and the food excelent. After three visits I never stay anywhere else when in London. Keep up the good work all at my London Home.
53,993,"Jun 9 2006 	Very nice hotel in superb location	For the last two months I have been staying in New England 3 times and enjoyed it very much. The location is superb, full of shopping centres, nice pubs, restauramts and cafes. Tube/coach/railway stations are in 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The staff is very helpful, flexible, friendly and open to the guests' feedback to make their staying more enjoyable. The hotel is cosy, clean and has sort of domestic environment. Very first time I stayed in New England I made a comment that it would be great to provide iron to the guests. Next time I arrived, Jay, Hotel Manger, took care of this and I was very pleased to find a new iron in my room. Third time the iron was provided in a 'it-goes-without-saying' way. In my opinion, this hotel is perfect for singles, tourists and travelling couples. Not sure if it would be that good if you are travelling with little kids. To the management team I would recommend to provide a bigger selection of food for breakfast, for example, to add vegetables to traditional English Breakfast or more pastry/yougurts for Continental Breakfast. Overall, I am personally planning to stay in this hotel in future and highly recommend this to other people travelling in London.PS Please bring your own shower supplies."
54,993,"Jun 8 2006	Looking for a great place to stay in London?!	June 8, 2006My wife and I have just returned from a 16 day stay at the New England Hotel, located at 20 Saint George's Drive, Victoria, London SW1V 4BN. The Location of this hotel is within easy walking distance of Victoria Station, espcially for travellers using Gatwick airport as our point of entry.Added to this, the room was priced well within our budget which included breakfast, and ensuite facilities, and very comfortable. The owners, Jay and Family were warm, welcoming and helpful. The establishment was clean, safe and secure. This is a facility that I will stay at again, whenever my travel plans include London as a point of destination. I have recommended this Hotel to several of my fellow employee at my office since my return. One of them is planning to visit London with his family this summer 2006. Date of my arrival: Wednesday May 17, 2006Date of my Departure: Friday June 2, 2006 This might not be &quot;The Ritz&quot;, but you get value for your money!"
55,993,"Jun 8 2006	great place to stay	We couldn't ask for a more friendly place. the front desk was great,and the behind the scenes staff made it feelmore like a home than a hotel.Loved it and would come back without a second thought"
56,993,"Jun 7 2006	Our Whole Family Loved It!	Our family, including my mother, brother, husband, and teenage daughters, all agree that we will be staying at the New England Hotel the next time we get to London. The staff is great. They made us feel like family while we were there. The rooms are clean and the location is very convenient. We even enjoyed making the reservations!"
57,993,"Jun 7 2006	Friendly Staff / Good Accommodation 	Overall, our stay has been very enjoyable. The staff was always gracious and helpful. Besides the dated furnishings, the hotel is very clean and efficient."
58,993,"Jun 6 2006	Ideal for our needs clean and friendly staff	We were in London to do and see as much as possible in a few days.The New England Hotel, being within walking distance of Victoria Station, was an excellent base.The hotel offered basic breakfast and accommodation, and it was very clean and tidy and the staff very friendly and helpful."
59,993,Jun 6 2006	Treated us like family	My family and I stayed here for the better part of a week and had a wonderful experience. We were warmly greeted and made to feel at home every time the staff saw us. The location is perfect for seeing the sights of London. We look forward to another visit.
60,993,"Jun 6 2006	Nice Hotel and staff	My wife and I stayed at the New England on a weekend. We thought the room was comfortable and the staff was very nice. They were certainly trying hard to please. The hotel is fairly close to Victoria station and buses which made it convenient. The morning breakfast was good, as well. It is only from 8 to 9 though so there isn't much room for fooling around. Thanks to Divina and Jay."
61,993,"Jun 6 2006	excellent hotel	we came from scotland to stay in london to celabrate my husbands brithday and take in a show. the hotel and its staff only added to our enjoyment and made it an enjoyable weekendi found the hotel to be very acessable, you could acess all areas of london from this locationthe staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help you it was easter weekend when we stayed and even though the hotel was busy you felt that due to the service you recieved you were the only guest there.Breakfast was excellent and well presented  i would certainly stay there again without hestiation when ever i am back in london"

65,993,Jun 4 2006	Pleasant Place New England Hotel	Our stay at the New England Hotel was a very pleasant experience. Both the location and price point for London were good. The hotel staff was very helpful with any questions and requests we asked of them. The rooms were neat and clean and it was nice to have the elevator at the end of a long day of walking to see all the sights. We would recommend a stay with this hotel.
66,993,"Jun 3 2006	Very friendly and welcoming	I stayed in the New England Hotel for the second time. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean, but sometimes a bit small. Anyway, good value for money."
67,993,"Jun 3 2006	Location Locatin Location	This is an excellent choice for a budget category hotel especially if flying into Gatwick. No tube travel is necessary to arrive at the hotel, which is a big deal if you have to juggle luggage and crowded tube conditions. The hotel room and bath are very very clean, and the beds were really comfortable.You can set up tours from the front desk upon arrival, the process was very easy, and the tour was excellent. As a first time visitor to London, I felt very comfortable in the surrounding area. You are very near underground, train , and bus connections. Many major sites are within 2 tube stops or a brief walk."
68,993,"Jun 2 2006	A fabulous and welcoming hotel	I stayed at the Hotel for four days and the experience was wonderful. The aspects that impressed me most were how quiet the rooms were (and we had a room facing the busy street yet slept soundly due to the lack of noise), how convenient the elevator is for those of us who have heavy bags, how modern the shower was (hot water always available and the water pressure was strong as well), and best of all, the comfortable beds (the mattresses were as comfortable as ours at home). Not to mention the friendly and helpful staff who run this hotel as a warm, inviting, family business. I highly recommend this hotel to those who are planning a stay in London. The location is so convenient (one morning I was able to walk to Buckingham Palace down to Big Ben and Parliament and back; not to mention that Victoria coach station and the underground are just a few blocks away) and the facilities are quite up-to-date. While the rooms are not vastly spacious, ours was more than enough for two of us with four large pieces of luggage. As well, the room was very clean, the towels very large, and the atmosphere was very nice. I will not hesitate to stay at the New England again."
69,993,"Jun 2 2006	a grat hotel	this is a good hotel,it's very clean and confortable. if i return in london i woul like to stay in thi hotel again. the staff is friendly"
70,993,"Jun 1 2006	A Very Good Find	Besides the cleanliness, location and value, the staff makes or breaks a hotel. The New England was just right for us. Jay &amp; his staff made us feel welcome from the start.The rooms are neat and clean, small but typical of London size rooms.The elevator is great, especially after a busy day of touring. Excellent location, near lots of sights and Victoria Station. Breakfast is simple but adequate. Many places to shop and eat nearby. We booked on-line from the US, very easy to do business with the New England, would repeat if coming back."
71,993,"Jun 1 2006	Looking for a good value?	We found the New England to be a good value for a modestly priced hotel in London. Within walking distance of Victoria Station, it issituated in a nice, quiet neighborhood; cabs were also extremely accessible. Just down the street, we found a nice little family restauraunt where we ate several times and also a corner store for junk food.The staff was friendly and most accomodating. The rooms are not spacious but the beds were comfortable. If you want a clean, affordable place to stay and can accept function over fancy, the New England is a great value."
72,993,"Jun 1 2006	Very nice hotel very hospitable service	Very quiet, easy to access and attentive service. Nice hotel, very basic, clean and well tended. I would come to this hotel again - Good for a long stay!Personal service beyond my expectation, very convenient to all of London's sites and city events."
73,993,"Jun 1 2006	Terrific Location 	Excellent Location  close to tubes, good surrounding areas, can easily walk to many tourist attractions. There are very good restaurants + pubs closeby. Owners and staff are friendly + helpful. Rooms are clean, bright and well tended, but small. The breakfast is okay but not much variety if you stay for a week. Could have a few more selections. Overall for location, price quality and service I would recommend it, and would come back again. And I have personally recommended it to my friends as well."
74,993,"Jun 1 2006	A great location to start visiting London	I chose this hotel for the location (Victoria, London) and for the good rewies read on this site. I stayed with my parents 4 nights in room 38: a nice and clean room with 3 single bed and a bathroom.First of all I have to say that the elevator is big enough for 3 person with a suitcase though what I read in other rewies.The roads around the hotel are quiet so you can sleep without problems.The breakfast (tea or coffe, juice -orange or apple-, toasts butter marmalade, beacon or cornflakes) was enough for us.The best of this hotel is the attention to the guests. It's a family run hotel and the hospitality is great.From the hotel you can easly reach by feet coach, underground and rail Station, then following the Buckingham Palace Road you arrive in front of Buckingham Palace without paying for transports.Hi from Italy"
75,993,"Jun 1 2006	Highly recommended	This was my first trip to London, and the accommodations and staff at the New England Hotel made it the best. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The staff treated me and my son like family. They were eager to help with any problem, and make suggestions to help us get the most from our vacation. The breakfasts were very good and the service was fast and efficient. I hope to return soon and look forward to a repeat stay."
76,993,Jun 1 2006	wonderful location great amentiesand helpful staff!!!!!	We were so glad to find this wonderful hotel...within walking distance to Victoria station and Buckingham Palace. Very helpful staff and the good english breakfast every morning woudl start our day. We will return to this hotel on our next London &quot;holiday.&quot;
77,993,"Jun 1 2006 	Fantastic Atmosphere	For someone who detests London Hotels, The New England was a welcome change from the normal corporate blandness experienced at some of the big chain hotels. It's excellent central location and friendly owners keep me coming back."
78,993,"Apr 29 2006	Great location attentive service	We stayed in the New England Hotel in London for 3 nights in April. The hotel is very close to the Victoria station which is very convenient for train/coach services. The rooms are clean, well maintained and adequate. The breakfast is simple but nice. We like the breakfast room. Jay and Anjie are very good hosts. They took care of all our needs during our stay (eg. getting us an iron, find out information on the internet for us etc.) and they are very warm individuals. We would recommend this hotel."
79,993,"Mar 29 2006	Cozy B+B Centrally Located	Moderately-priced cozy rooms are close to Victoria train and coach stations. Anjie was very accomodating - she booked our Windsor/Bath/Stonehenge tour, got us our Big Bus tickets etc. Jay arranged an iron and ironing board. Anjie made a pot of tea when I really needed one. She was also kind enough to store some sandwiches we had made in the refridgerator so we could take them on our bus tour the next day. Overall, staff and accomodations are very good. One more thing, Anjie went outside of their hotel's normal operating procedure in booking us for one night (Saturday March 25th) - the hotel usually does not allow one night bookings during a weekend, but since we had stayed March 12th - 16th they made an allowance. We thought this was very accomodating of them."
80,993,"Mar 22 2006	Charming Place in London	The New England Hotel is a charming little hotel in Westminster. It is very convenient to transportation, just a few blocks away at Victoria station. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is most helpful and cheerful. Everything is clean. Your day begins with an English breakfast in the dining room as the Time Tunnel radio station gives you a taste of UK radio. The room is tidy with a comfortable bed and furnishings. Everyday it is prepared for you after a day of sightseeing.The front desk can provide tickets and information to all the tours and attractions.It is easy to imagine being in Victorian London and having your horse drawn carriage deliver you to the door of your New England Hotel. You climb the steps and open the sturdy wooden door and walk into the charm and service from an earlier time. You will enjoy your stay here."
81,993,"Mar 16 2006	Just fine	We stayed at the New England Hotel in Feb. and March 2006. The Hotel is in a great location near Victoria Station. It is close to Buckingham Place, the Thames and if you don't mind walking a bit, many other attractions. The room we had was nice, a bit small but that was to be expected. The bathroom was very clean, lots of hot water and the staff friendly and helpful."
82,993,Mar 16 2006	My Home in London	This was my second stay at the New England Hotel and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. Anjie and Jay are so accommodating and friendly. The breakfast is very tasty (even after 12 days) and a nice way to start the day. The hotel is very clean and within walking distance to the Underground. There are very nice restaurants and a grocery store in the neighborhood. The rooms are quiet and comfortable. Wonderful hot showers (bring your own shower supplies). I will definitely stay at the New England Hotel again.

1,997,"Beware of this Hotel!	I was utterly disappointed with this hotel property. Though the hotel facade tells of a different story, the room that was set aside for our 2-day stay left a lot to be desired. The corridor and the room had such a musty smell that at certain times were too over-powering. The room itself had no appeal with bed and beddings reminiscent of the 1960's. The bathroom was the size of a closet with the shower stall no bigger than a bread box - it was so small that the soap holders were outside the shower stall! I've had better accommodations in third world countries! Beware of this property!"
2,997,Total Dump - Avoid Avoid Avoid	Booked the hotel on travel supermarket and was listed as a four star hotel. It wasn't all that cheap but I wouldn't give this hotel 1 star. The carpets and furniture in the room were filthy. There were damp patches on the walls. The bathroom was like a fridge and there was barely enough room to squeeze through to the loo. Was amazed when the shower had hot water. Burnt my hand on the lamp in the bedroom which was unsafe. Travelled with my partner and was amazed to be put in a twin room. I think all rooms are twin rooms. For one night was good comedy value but all in all remembered for the wrong reasons. Having said all that location was good shame about the hotel!!!
3,997,"Oct 24 2009 	Perfectly decent for the area	In other parts of the country, you'd probably expect more from a three star hotel and about 80 for the night. Around the Paddington hotel district, with easy access to Paddington station, bus and tube to take one around town, I've paid more for less. Compared to other hotels on Norfolk Square, this one is on the right side of the square - the side where the back of the hotel doesn't get all the noise from the tube and where you're not woken up in the morning as the trains on the Circle line start running. There's delivery traffic in the square, but not too heavy; the situation is as quite as it gets here. My room was in the back of the hotel, towards an alley, and I couldn't hear any traffic at all even with the window open, let alone people. The room (twin for single occupancy, on the ground floor) was surprisingly spacious (again, given the area; other hotel rooms I've seen around the square have all been smaller), it had a proper writing desk and a small easy chair, and a good-size wardrobe. The decor, bed spreads and carpets had seen some use but were clean and tidy. (Having seen some of the reviews here before checking in, I must admit to checking for bed bugs!) The bathroom (with a tub and blissfully hot water round the clock) was small but had been vigorously cleaned. My one issue with the room was that I had been placed in a smoker's room; not a problem for me as I smoke myself, but one that could have been highly problematic for an allergic or asthmatic traveller - do ask for a non-smoking room if you need it! My expectations were as limited as my budget, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one."
4,997,"Oct 20 2009 	What a FleaPit	I was terrified to walk around in the room with my shoes off. My husband, teenage son and myself stayed in a triple room. I get the miniscule size of the room but the cleanliness issue was scary. The bathroom in particular was very unclean and the basin plug was not in working order. The noise from the open window in the bathroom was atrocious and went on most of the time. The people upstairs creaked up and down the entire night until the early hours of the morning. All three of us experienced mysterious bites. Side reading lights didn't work. The bed coverlets had badly repaired tears and smelled used. We come from a third world country, where this hotel would not even compare to a 1 star in our country. The breakfast was also mediochre to say the least, even with a 3 pound upgrade to have a full english. Apalling."
5,997,"Sep 30 2009 	Very bad 'Hotel'	I was given room 211. The view is a brick wall. The bed cover was old, with a large frayed hole. The bathroom was dirty, mildew fungi covered all the silicone covered gaps. The matress was old rickety and made 'bong' sounds sitting on the edge of the bed. My room was changed to 111, this room had a broken washing machine for a view. The bathroom had the same mildew problem. Water leaked into the bathroom through the concrete celing. The room TV, must be the smalest on the market. The 'free' internet did not work. The passages smell badly of old cigarette smoke, are very narrow with fire doors banging, disturbing your sleep. Please stay away, avoid this very bad 'hotel', it is a disgusting smelly old dump. The Norfolk Plaza is not suitable for business or tourist visits. Stay away!"
6,997,Sep 8 2009 	Ok for one night	Good hotel for short stay Location good and right next to Paddington for connections to City Centre Room was a bit small and bathroom needed cleaned or an upgrade Breakfast was great and all staff were nice and helpful
7,997,"Aug 4 2009 	Very nice hotel - try it!	I visited Norfolk Plaza Hotel July 30. - August 2. in 2009. I had read many of the reviews at TripAdvisor, and had low expectations. But I was surprised. I got rom 508. I was quite a large room, clean and nice. It had all the facilities that I needed. You had to learn how to flush the toilet, but then it worked OK. The shower had hot water all the time. The bed was a bit uncomfortable, though, but that was not a big problem. The staff was polite and helpful."
8,997,"Jul 17 2009 	bugs galore	Stayed at this hotel with my young children and my elderly parents. Booked in for one night because the train was late home for my children . Had 2 rooms of three which were sub standard but it was only for one night so we put up with it. Come the morning my daughter had a lot of blood spots on her face, after inspection we found that two of the beds were infested with bed bugs. Not only masses of eggs underneath the 4 layers of fitted sheets but also large walking ones. This hotel is disgusting and should have been closed down years ago!!"
9,997,"Feb 13 2009 	well....not impressed	I booked this hotel back in late november after seeing it listed as a central location for a good price. The internet price was close to 300 but when I mailed the hotel they offered me a suite room for me, my partner and two children at 95 per night which i thought was good. After checking trip advisor I saw some really bad reviews and the same problem was in a lot f them, rooms cold and bad showering facilities so i rag the hotel to cancel and the reservation girl called Melanie was very rude, she was abrupt and kept saying hold and if I said anything she said &quot; I said HOLD madam&quot; Then she said the cancellation reference number really fast so I said can she repest it and she hung up the phone. Really bad, in a time of recession you would imagine people would go that extra mile to guarantee business but clearly not. I then went on to book the travel lodge at london bridge, basic but really well priced at 77 per night for a quad room... :)"
10,997,Feb 2 2009 	No hot water no heating	Stayed at this hotel for one night - we were in a large triple roomon the top floor which was basic but clean. Our problem was that when we arrived at 6pm our room was freezing cold when werang reception they told us the heating was due to come on....it came on after 8 and went off 2 hours later and our room nevergot warm. We went to the bar for a couple of drinks and as wewe starting our second drink at 10.30pm they just closed the barand turned the tv off without a word!! The staff were not rude butthey all had a cant be bothered attitude and were matter of fact with us. When we got up next morning at 8.45am we had no hotwater so we left straight away without staying for breakfast. The hotel was cheap we stayed in a triple room for 65.00 and it was a couple of streets from Paddington which was great and itwas clean but we all felt that no matter what the price we shouldhave got basic comforts ie heat and hot water. We would not return.
11,997,"Jan 28 2009 	Not the best	Very, very basic hotel rooms are clean but very dated, beds not the most comfortable either. You can hear the person in the room next to you and people on the corridors at night time plus if anybody is outside your window you can hear them! It is in a terrific location only a 5 minute walk from Paddington Station. If you don't plan on spending much time in the room and are looking for something cheap and central this hotel is ok."
12,997,"Jan 25 2009 	Freezing	The hotel was very close to Paddington station and St. Mary's hospital, not more than 5 minutes walk.I stayed in freezing conditions in January. Walking into my room I felt that I hadn't even gone inside , there was no heating. I turned the radiator on to find it did not come on. I was told they have the heating on for two hours, then off for two hours so it would come on from 8 to 10. It did, but it wasn't nearly enough to warm the room (considering that my radiator had been turned off all day). They had no blow heater or anything to give me. The response at reception was sort of shrug the shoulders. However, the conceirge was quite apologetic.Generally hotels dont advertise heating as a perk, because I think its kind of assumed. I could not believe the AA sign outside - giving this hotel 4 stars. I no longer have faith in the AA ratings - I guess they must have stayed in the summer. Clearly all the money they saved on heating goes to decorating the reception area which looks very nice (great!)I dont really have any other complaints (I did only stay one night). The room was basic, but clean. I'm giving one star because I think being warm enough to take your coat off and relax is a fundemental in my opinion for a 4 star hotel( or guest house). If I'd walked in and they didn't have a bed in the room, or there was no roof I'd give it one star then as well."
13,997,"Oct 25 2008 	Try elsewhere first...	My wife and I stayed at this hotel on 21 and 22 October 2008, booking the hotel online because of its great location and reasonable price.When we arrived we were pleased to see that it really was only about a 2 minute walk around the corner from Paddington Underground Station.Upon our arrival the hotel seemed nice, and had a frontage nicer than the other hotels and hostels in the Norfolk Park. Reception is nicely decorated and seems newly renovated as does the bar with the nice big plasma near the reception; that is about as much praise as I can sing for this place.The lady on reception seemed very indifferent to our being at the hotel, we given Room 104 on the first floor.The only way up/down in the hotel, is a very old lift.Our room request was for a double/twin, we received a triple.The room was old, and didn't look like it had received any TLC in at least the last 20 years. The beds were terrible, they were old spring mattresses, the pillows were more like quarter filled sandbags, and the television was a generous 20 centimeter screen.Now I have stayed at many budget hotels, however at a rate of $230 a night I expected a little more.The bathroom was basic - toilet, shower, and basin, however....Our first morning we could not get hot water for 90 minutes because the boiler was on the brink. The second morning we didn't even need to use the cold water tap because the hot water was luke warm at best.The toilet was very average, I actually got excited when I could flush everything in one attempt. We were also lucky enough to have a nicely cracked toilet seat which had been there for some time. The tiles on the bath/shower were coming off, and the shower head was very, very old.The room was also quite noisy, just beware if you have early risers above you as you can hear them walking around.We did not eat at the hotel as it was a little pricey, there are loads of little cafe's within walking distance that offer a great breakfast for between 2 and 5 pounds nearby.The concierge desk was very helpful when we checked out and happily stowed our bags for the afternoon, the man working there at least had a personality...As far as this hotel goes, it had all the basic required amenities, however it was not very nice, I would seriously consider the 30 pound hostel 100 metres from this hotel which I am sure would offer no less of a room for a fraction of the price, whilst still in the same great location.This hotel would be perfect of the owners spent a little bit of money just updating the essentials in the room, until then I would recommend elsewhere."
14,997,"Oct 24 2008 	Good location but....	I stayed here for 1 night in october 2008.The room I stayed in was the cheapest but still it cost 100 (from internett) incl. breakfast. It was not worth it. I would pay 20 (incl. breakfast), not more.The room was terrible, old furniture and bad built. It HAS to be upgraded. The elevator was old, the hallway to the rooms was narrow. Some of the tiles on the bathroom were loose. The room in all was in bad shape. The floor in the room was not in good shape. The lobby and breakfastroom was OK. From the outside the hotel looks very nice... From the site I booked this room it was a 3 star hotel! NO way!But some good things about this hotel:good breakfastthe bed was good, I slept wellgood location not far from Paddington station (train, subway)friendly staffBut I will not be back!"
15,997,"Oct 10 2008 	Stay away	As some other reviewers have stated, it looks great from the outside, but wait until you get to the rooms...my friend and I went to stay a night so we could see a few shows. The location is all that's great about this hotel. Both our rooms were like walking into a dorm...I thought it might be staff accommodation, but I feel sorry for the staff is that's true. Poorly furnished and the twin beds were VERY uncomfortable - made it difficult to sleep. I don't understand how they get such a high AA rating. And the rooms were in the 'basement', sub-ground floor. The windows were not secure (not much light either)...I could find no way of closing them completely. There were latches attached, but the screws had come out and they just hung against the window preventing one of them from closing properly. The pillows were horrible, but on opening the closet, I found some new ones that were adequate.I didn't want the Ritz but for the money, I've certainly had much better. I will say the Concierge was delightful about our bags."
16,997,"Oct 10 2008 	Never again	We arrived at the hotel late after having flown from our stay in Holland. The staff were not overly helpful and the keycard to open our room didn't work which meant another trip to reception. The floors creaked, the room was old and shabby well in need of a coat of paint. The view was of other hotels rears and not at all attractive. The bathroom was not very nice and it was very difficult getting the toilet to flush at all. The beds were awful and i'm sure quite old and in need of an upgrade. The only fairly good comment i can make is that of the breakfast which was okay."
17,997,"Oct 6 2008 	Poor hotel	I have stayed at this hotel in the past in 2003, it seems to do well due to being cheap and having a good location but it really is an awful hotel. This time we had a room in the basement, twin share. My bed had a very old spring mattress and I couldn't sleep. When we used the stairs and walked upstairs the 1st floor smelt of urine (I'm a Nurse so trust me I know the smell well). And they provide smoking rooms so the floors smell like smoke as well. We stayed in the Athena Hotel one street away the week before and it was the same price and a beautiful stay.The hotel porter was helpful but the Reception staff weren't very nice and were poorly presented.I don't recommend this hotel and won't stay there again."
18,997,"Aug 5 2008 	Don't be put off!!! It's fine basic but clean and nice.	Like most I read the reviews and thought &quot;What have I let myself in for??&quot;. I am not fussy and would sleep on a park bench, but my wife and child couldn't be more different... they like their luxuries! In short if you want a cheap, clean hotel in a great area you cant go wrong. You get a decent bathroom, TV, Tea/coffee making facilities and a clean bedroom etc. its not the Hilton, but its on par with a Travel Lodge type hotelThe hotel is in the best possible location (200m from Paddington Station, lots of restaurants, plus KFC, McDs, Burger King etc.), the reception area is very nice, the room was clean and tidy but could have done with a bit of modernizing (i.e. new bed bases or furniture), BUT the bathroom was a LOT better than i expected, very large and clean. If you are at the back of the hotel the views are of the back of other hotels, but there is no noise from traffic etc. If you are at the front youll have great views of a pretty park. There were no funny smells during our stay. The breakfast bar is nice and the food very good, and for just 3.50 you can upgrade to a full English from the continental breakfast that comes with your booking. The bar area is small but nice and all the staff are friendly, and the drinks are reasonably priced (2.80 for a pint of Carling) for London. We booked the hotel as it seemed to be the only room left in London under 200 a night which had triple rooms left. We booked the hotel direct and got a very large discount (95 inc Breakfast) from the advertised rate. We stayed in room 106, so I would urge you to try and book that room if you have a child as it is big and you will not be disappointed. Just remember  it is basic, but cheap and clean!!"
19,997,"Jul 26 2008 	Lovely room	I had stayed at Norfolk Plaza 25 years ago, I knew it was in an excellent location and fairly (by London standards) cheap.After reading some of the reviews on your site I almost cancelled my reservation, I'm So glad I didn't, we were upgraded to a suite, which has the bedroom upstairs and a lounge room down stairs, the continental breakfast was very filling (included in price of room) I noticed some of the guests were having cooked breakfasts so I presume you can buy a cooked breakfast if you wish.Norfolk Plaza Hotel is around the corner from, Paddington station with the Heathrow express and Paddington Tube station.( they also have 2 small supermarkets in the station complex).Hyde Park is within walking distance.The staff were very friendly and I will be staying with them again."
20,997,"Jul 10 2008	Great Location Great Service	I was apprehensive from other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised! The room was small, but had a mini-bar, hair dryer, and tea pot. The room was clean and well cared for with a very firm bed. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. Breakfast in the breakfast room was reasonable by London standards. The location was excellent, just a short walk from Paddington Station, a transportation hub. There is a beautiful little park across the street from the hotel, and shopping and restaurants are abundant.The Norfolk Plaza is not a Holiday Inn Express, but Americans should not expect that in London for the rate I received, which was half of the regular room rate advertised by the hotel. I was quite happy with the Norfolk Plaza and its helpful, pleasant staff.I stay there again in a New York minute, at the price I paid!"
21,997,"Jul 1 2008 	Great Location Dirty Rooms	Stayed at the hotel in June 2008. As others have noted, the location is great; about 500 meters to Paddington tube stop (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines) and a little further of a walk underground to get to the main train station where the Heathrow Express comes in. It's a busy area with lots of shops and restaurants but the hotel is on a side block with a nice park in the middle. In my opinion the hotel is 2 star not 3 star. I booked a single and was given a twin so had a bit more room than I expected. The room (502) was on the 5th (top floor) and faced the back of the building so relatively quiet at night even with the window open (I found the room to be very hot). But if you plan to sleep past 8 AM bring ear plugs because the maids literally start slamming the doors to wake people up (I found this every morning, including the weekends). The room was dirty and badly in need of updating. There were some nasty stains on the blanket and bedspread. The sheets were clean though. The bathrooms was old but cleaned well on a daily basis. The door to the room was not secure at all and would be very easy to open with a hard shoulder to the door. I was very concerned with leaving anything of value in the room but luckily I didn't have any problems. There is no safe in the room. There was also no chain or deadbolt on the inside of the door to be able to secure the door when you are in the room. I booked the room using Hotwire and paid about $100 per night. I think for that price in central London, I got what I paid for. If I had paid much more than that, it would not have been worth it."
22,997,"May 26 2008 	Great Location	I've stayed at this spot every month for the last 3 years during business trips to the UK..The location is perfect ..... right next to Paddinton station and loads of Bus routes. It's also only 20mins away from Heathrow on the express.It's a 3 star hotel, so you can't expect the Hilton, but i've always found it to be fairly clean and the staff accomodating.I'd say it is perfect for short business trips or family weekends to explore London"
23,997,"Apr 10 2008	Never again	I stayed at the Norfolk Plaza Hotel in March 2008. I was going as part of a student study group and had no choice in the booking of the hotel. Before I left, I looked the hotel up on their own website, which made it look pretty nice. I then looked it up on Trip Advisor and saw all the terrible reviews. I kept thinking it couldn't possibly be that bad. But it was! Everything people said was true.Being part of a student group, they automatically put us in the basement. The room was freezing! They turn the heat off completely overnight. Beds are super old twin beds that are hard, sagging, thin, with springs pushing through. The bathroom was the worst thing I've ever encountered. (See pictures) So small. I am not exaggerating that the shower (there was no tub) is a 2ft. square stall with one soap dish. There is no way to shave your legs, as there is no room to lift your leg. There was a huge push-out window in the bathroom that wouldn't close completely so it was freezing in there all the time. If you didn't shower by 7:30 a.m. the water would be cold.Some of the students and faculty stayed in rooms on upper floors that had different bathrooms that didn't seem quite as bad. So, if for some reason you must stay here, ask for an upper floor room. Although they did have same issues with cold showers and no heat.Breakfast buffet was okay. Croissants, rolls, fruit and salad.The location in Paddington was okay. There is a small park across the street. But it wasn't close to any of the museums or markets.I had never traveled to London before, so I have nothing to compare it to. I expected small rooms but not the rest of the problems. I suggest avoiding this hotel if possible."
24,997,"Feb 25 2008 	Hotel was terrible	so very unhappy with this hotel. Would have preferred to stay in a brothel in bangladesh.we arrived at half 12 the first night absolutely exhausted and dying for a nice restful sleep in a comfy room! - *CRACKED WALLS covered in POLYFILLA!! *AWFUL decor that looked nothing like the picture I saw on their webpage(one side old 70s wallpaper, next side painted etc. horrible old carpet!)*SMELLY bathroom!unpacked our clothes - *HOLE in the wall in our wardrobe, where you could see the all the plumbing!!After that disappointment all we wanted was a good night sleep - * STAINS on our bedlinen!! (they were obviously washed but the STAIN had not come out - they still should not have been used again!)WE were so exhausted we went to sleep(with a towel covering the lovely stain!). Got up for a shower next morning - *COLD SHOWER!!!!!We were upgraded to a suite. Which was still a kip, but atleast the shower was hot and the sheets were cleanWould not recommend this hotel to anyone."
25,997,"Feb 2 2008 	Disgusting filthy Hotel	Received a Christmas present of a London show with 4 star hotel accomodation in London (Bought from boots). Booked the show and was given accomodation at this hotel with the package. I booked an extra night at 73.50. When you arrive at the hotel you think it looks very nice from outside, and when you enter the building it looks great. BEWARE - you havent got to the bedrooms yet.Walked into the bedroom, and the first thing I noticed was the holes in the unwashed net curtains. I went to the bathroom - oh my god - filthy to say the least, the bottom of the toilet bowl was black. the grouting in the tiles was black. There was growth of some form of fungus on the window, and the bath was filthy. When i got into the bed (and i wish i hadn't) the pillowcash had holes in it, and was badly stained, the remainder of the bed linen was also disgusting. The room looked like it was last decorated just before the war - the first world war. AA have awarded this hotel 4 stars - The person who did this must have been blind and had no sence of smell. (OH DID I TELL YOU THIS PLACE SMELLS AS WELL). There is a kettle in the room, put clean water in and get dirty water out....DO NOT expect anything better than a 1 star slum if you are going to this hotel. You will get better accomodation at the YMCA.When I made my complaint at reception, the receptionist then began not to understand the English Language and all she could say is sorry. SORRY???, they have the room rates up at 135 for a twin room per night. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY SHOULD PAY YOU TO STAY THERE......By the way, did I tell you that I hated my stay there?I hove arrived back home safe, however lots of bites all over my body. Well SOMETHING enjoyed me staying there......"
26,997,"Nov 13 2007 	perhaps lucky this time	I have stayed here before and had a very small room, this time I had a nice large twin room, quiet location and good cost 71. The only complaint I could have was that the kettle didn't work and the room information was very out of date. But for a quiet convenient, reasonable priced place to stay, I would recommend it."
27,997,"Nov 2 2007 	Basic but comfortable	Basic hotel - no frills. Room scruffy but clean.Problems were - shower switch didn't work properly; lighting was very poor (dingy room); pillows terrible - take your own. Buffet breakfast extremely limited choice - no fresh fruit.Good things were - staff very helpful; lift (essential) ; place looked clean.Bags stored safely for you after check-out, not just left in a corner.Excellent location - easy walk with cases from Paddington station, easy access underground and buses, central location, away from busy road so no traffic noise.Expensive hotel for the state of the rooms and the breakfast, but had several advantages worth paying the extra for."
28,997,"Oct 13 2007 	Hotwire did good!	The Norfolk Plaza isn't posh, and I lucked out with an upgrade to a double. But at $100 per night plus tax from Hotwire, I could have done a lot worse. The location is superb--spitting distance from Paddington Station, arguably the most serviceable of all the major London rail hubs."
29,997,"Sep 6 2007 	Motel 6 is BETTER!!!	Don't believe what you see on their website!!! It's all a lie! Sure, the lobby looks impressive and it has a posh name &quot;Plaza Hotel&quot;. But believe me, it doesn't even come close! First of all, my reservation was booked for 1 but there were 2 of us checking in. They increased the rate because of the additional bed. Fine, I paid. Once I got up to my floor, the hallway was extremely narrow, all the doors were made of cheap partical board and the floors creaked as if ready to collapse. Then we opened the door. It was the most disgusting place I have ever seen! The room was old and musty and the drapes and bedspreads were faded and stained. There were 3 twin beds (yes 3 beds regardless if I was checking in as 1, 2 or 3...my original room didn't changed when they realized there were 2 of us), they had caved in mattresses, and to top it off, there was a 12 inch TV mounted on the wall. Not to mention, there was no sort of high speed internet connection.I literally feared for my life. There is no way I could have slept in this room. No, i'm not a hotel snob, but there are limits. I would have laid in bed wide awake the enitre night thinking there were bugs crawling all over me. The room was so filthy! Can you believe they even advertise a suite? Also, the hotel had a safe (not even free unlike all the other London hotels i've stayed in) for our valuables but i'm sure it was not large enough to hold all our belongings and luggage as well as ourselves.Fortunately, I found another much better hotel for only an additional 15 GBP (after I loss half of my room rate for the night...but worth it) and ran out of the Plaza as fast as I could!"
30,997,"Aug 30 2007	What a difference!	We recently visited London. Our first hotel was a mistake, but fortunately, this hotel was not. It was quiet, clean and extremely comfortable. Everything about this hotel, from the staff to the amenities offered were first rate. I will recommend this hotel to anyone visiting London and needing a quiet, clean, reasonable hotel."
31,997,"Jul 25 2007	What's with everyone else?	I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about! I stayed at the Norfolk Plaza for over a week and was completely satisfied with the cleanliness of the room and the kindness of the staff (they even opened the bar for us). To top this all off, excellent location, a block from the major tube stop of Paddington. Given how expensive EVERYTHING in London is, save some money by staying here and splurging to see a show. How often should one be in a hotel room during a vacation anyway?"
32,997,"Jul 11 2007 	Simply a hot humid dump!	I traveled with a group of students to this hotel and was incredibly underwhelmed by most aspects of the property. To be fair, let me start with a few redeeming qualities that warrant kudos:-Location is fine, near Hyde Park and across the street from a quaint city park that's very tiny.-Included breakfast was the highlight of the hotel. Very pleasant selection of items and seemed relatively clean.-Tiny, but serviceable bar in the lobby that featured a friendly bartender pouring some local brews.Among the MANY negatives of this hotel:-Rooms looked out onto dirty walls of adjoining buildings. Windows barely cracked open to let air in, and NO AIR CONDITIONING IN SUMMER!!!!!-Only ventilation was a tiny fan in the room, and rooms smelled very musty and old.-Bedding wasn't clean. Spots on all blankets and sheets, floor coverings not kept clean.-Noise in hallways leaks through paper thin walls.-One very tiny elevator services entire hotel.-Bathrooms are truly so small that you can barely turn around in them. With some effort I think it'd be possible to use the toilet, shower and sink all at the SAME TIME!! You can't sit in tubs if you're over 5'7&quot;.-Front desk staff barely knew what a wake-up call was when I asked for one. No clock in room!-TV was very tiny and got I believe 3 channels.While I still very much enjoyed my trip and wouldn't trade the memories, I'd gladly trade the sleepless and sweaty nights I spent at the Norfolk Plaza. Off the topic, a nearby restaurant recommendation is a pasta place called &quot;Ask&quot;. Good food and atmosphere, and not terribly priced. Got to this restaurant, then get a cab to a different hotel!"
33,997,"Jul 11 2007 	Bad staff	I got stranded in London, did a late booking over the internet, and arrived about midnight. Was then kept waiting, told that there might be a problem with my booking, ie no rooms, then was kept waiting more as the guy started dealing with someone else who had arrived after me - not a quick simple query, but something turning into a lengthy conversation. When I got irritated and asked him to finish dealing with me first, he told me he was doing me a favour trying to get me a room (which had been properly booked, credit card etc) and went on to say that he could instead just rip up my registration card.At which point I left.I probably didn't behave perfectly, but certainly wasn't aggressive."
34,997,"Feb 5 2007	Don't even bother.	There is nothing good to say about this place. The entrance may look fairly ok, but beyond that it just keeps getting worse. The room we had was appalling - grubby looking, stained and torn bedding, the mattresses were so old that the lumpyness of the springs and the huge dent in the middle were plain to see without pulling the covers back. Carpets are worn and dirty. The shower is pathetic, and the bathroom floor was just cracked tiles which felt horrible to stand on, like somebody had chipped the grouting out. The room and bathroom (toilet, sink, bath) were just generally grubby too, and the shower curtain could well have done with being replaced. The place just felt dirty and smelt weird. After asking to change rooms, we were afforded one without ripped bed covers and a completely wrecked matress, plus the fact that there was light coming into the window and not some noisy generator outside it gave a slightly brighter feel. All the other faults remained however. The floors in this place creak like anything and there seemed to be endless door-slamming and noise coming from elsewhere. Also, after a short shower one night there was very little hot water left in our room. Unless you're desperate, there is no justification for recommending this hotel."
35,997,"Jan 31 2007 	They froze us!	We stayed for two nights at the Norfolk Plaza Hotel and I can honestly say I have never had such a poor experience in any hotel around the world.The first impression on entering the hotel is that it reeks of cigarette smoke. The bar is adjacent to the lobby and, as smoking is freely permitted in the bar, it permeates the entire area. Unfortunately, our room was on the ground floor, so the lingering smell made its way to our room also.When we checked in around 2pm, there was no heat in the room. We were told that it was on a timer and wouldn't be on for another couple of hours. There was a howling draft coming through a gap between the window frame and the ledge (also a safety issue in a ground floor room) and we finally complained loudly enough that they turned the heat on. On returning from dinner around 9:30pm, the heat was again off. That night it snowed. When we woke up in the morning - you guessed it - no heat. When my Mother went to take a shower - no hot water. The heat never did come on before we left around 9:30am for the day. We complained to the receptionist who told us she would get someone in to look at the window! When we returned that afternoon, the room had not been made up and again, no heat. I showered that afternoon in hot water, but the next morning there was again no heat and no hot water. Oh and, of course, no complimentary amenities in the bathroom.We complained at check out, but no apologies were given whatsoever. We received a good rate for a hotel in London, but if their way of compensating for offering discounts is to keep the guest in a freezing cold room, I hardly call that Hospitality - or value for money.I strongly advise anyone considering staying in this hotel - think again."
36,997,"Jan 20 2007 	Wouldn't go back	The good: - only a couple blocks from Paddington Station, which is the endpoint for the Heathrow Express. That means you can be at this hotel 45 minutes after landing (if BA doesn't lose your bags, as they did mine). Good neighborhood, easy to get anywhere else.- my room was very large: a 2 floor suite, in fact, for the price of the double.- plenty of hot water in the shower- if I sat in one corner of the room I could log onto free-hotspot.com which operates free wifi in the neighborhoodThe bad:- staff lazy and barely competent- walls and ceiling paper thin: I heard guest clomping around above me all night, and the man in the room next door snoring.- furniture the cheapest possible kind, and pretty beat up. Spilled drink stains on the chairs.- hotel suggests you pay them for wireless access, available only in the lobby, when the lobby gets GREAT reception for free-hotspot.com (which, obviously, is free)."
37,997,"Nov 10 2006 	Horrible and dirty	AVOID! This place is horrible, dirty, no hot water for shower. We stayed in room B-2 in the basement, and the bedclothes were dirty and stained, mattresses are barely usable, have no padding and can feel all metal parts. The shower had BLACK grout lines from mold. My travel companion had a cold shower and I was afraid to attempt it, so we left totally disgusted and I was dirty! I was so surprised and shocked because the front steps/sign look very nice!!!!!! I agree with previous reviewer that this place is a scam!!!!!!"
38,997,"Jul 19 2006	Dirty noisy dump with fancy facade	I have serious complaints about the hotel room we rented. Me, my wife and our one-year-old son came there the 15th of July and we had to change hotel the day after. If we weren't so tired we would have changed directly, when we saw and smelled the dirty room with the terrible view. But after one night laying awake, listening to TV-noise, people walking back and forth over our heads all night, run, slam doors and scream in the corridor or doing what they had to do in their toilettes, we had enogh. Also couldn't stand the uncomfortable place without aircondition. A four-star hotel should have at least a simple one. The polish woman at the desk got angry when I two times friendly asked to borrow an electric fan. The air stood totally still, no ventilation at all; we couldn't sleep whole night. Lost appetite totally for breakfast so we changed early next morning.Their business is a fraud. Trying to keep up appearances outside with a fancy entre and lounge you are very, very dishonest, the rooms are totally awful. The room we lived in is also a death trap for small children. No.215 has a window with only one hook you can not lock, a half meter from the floor. Hidden behind a curtain. If I hadn't checked the window at first, my son could quickly had climbed up, curiously opened the window and fallen to death ten meters down to the dirty backyard. When I complained, two guys came up and tried to fix it with a stick! Instead of putting a lock to the window. The electric connections in the closet are at least 40 years old and have rusty connections. The furniture is from the early seventies, dirty and worn out. The 20-years old &quot;satellite TV&quot; I had to fix myself when I came so it worked. Anyway, of five channels two of them were German and Arabic. The toilet didn't flush properly, the bathtub worn out, the washbowl was cracked. When I closed the door to the bathroom, three plates fell down from the outside of the tub and crashed on the floor. The bathroom smelled mould. The carpet had big stains, and smelled dirty, the baby couldn't crawl on them. The truth is a crappy, worn out, broken dump with dirty textiles of nylon."
39,997,"Apr 19 2006	old fashioned hotel	We wanted a reasonably priced ,comfortable hotel in the centre of London I found this on the internet and although dubious about the price we went ahead and booked. We were not disappointed. The cost for 1 night for the 2 of us was 70 including breakfast, aabsolute bargain in that part of London. The hotel is in a quiet square 3min from Paddington station.We were given a suite overlooking a square, the room was comfortable, clean, staff helpful. THe continental breakfast was adequate and there was a good choice. The only drawback were the creaky floorboards which could have woken the dead! If you just want a place for a couple of nights while you see a show this hotel makes a good base."
40,997,"Feb 3 2006	Better than expected	Having seen the poor recent reviews - I could not disagree more. The staff are a little aloof, but I expected that. We paid 135 for three nights Wednesday to Saturday. Daily rate is 120, booked via ebookers. Fantastic value for money. It was clean with reasonable food. It is one minutes walk from Paddington is a quiet square, with no traffic noise. Nice bar.Thumbs up from here."
41,997,"Jan 30 2006 	Bad rooms and staff	The staff is not friendly at all, I dont recommend an hour for a visit and looking at it.The dirts are everywhere, room is untidy, the view is on a shared garbage of the neighbors. As a result, the smell of the room is bad.I couldnt stay in the room for an hour, so I changed my hotel and paid a night charge :)I couldnt move my bage from the elevator to my room, becouse the ward was tinny."
42,997,"Oct 26 2005 	Massively overcharged	I stayed one night at the Norfolk Plaza during a Heathrow layover and have no complaints about the hotel itself. The rooms are small but tidy enough, it's a two-minute walk from the Heathrow Express at Paddington, and the rate was totally reasonable.My complaint is with the brazen dishonesty of the information booklet in the room, which seemed to indicate that a long-distance phone call to Canada would cost about 60p to a pound per minute. As I was only making one short call and it was a Sunday evening, I went ahead, figuring it was worth even 15 pounds to not have to go looking for a calling card in my jetlagged state. I made an 18-minute call. When I checked out the next morning, I was presented with a bill for 32.50 - a total not too much less than the cost of the room itself.I later spoke with the hotel manager, who declined to reduce the charge and argued that the sample tolls listed in the booklet were only &quot;approximate.&quot; Given that I was calling at one of the least expensive times of the week, I can only assume that the manger took the term to mean &quot;approximately half the lowest toll you can possibly expect.&quot;In short, not a bad hotel, if you don't mind the manager's apparent comfort with leaving deliberately misleading information in the rooms. And by no means make a phone call from your room under any circumstances. If the building's on fire, fashion a megaphone from your dishonest in-room info booklet and call for help out the window."
43,997,"Oct 14 2005	Horrible!!	I booked this hotel for one night, at the last minute...the lobby was nice.. but the room was another story..I agree with the previous post SCARY!! The lady at the reception was not friendly at all.. the toliet didn't flush...the tv remote didn't work...I slept in my jeans as I wasn't sure how clean the bed was..The location was convenient and there was a fish and chip shop 2 minutes away...but I would not stay there again...horrible!!!!! Pay a little more and get something decent!!!"
44,997,"Aug 26 2005	Avoid This Hotel	I stayed in this hotel last year and I was surfing the net and wanted to see if this hotel was still around), what a negative experience. The staff were rude, the toilet wouldn't flush, the window was broken and refused to close, I had personal belongings stolen by hotel staff, and the view was awful, a construction site. Went for the breakfast once and that was it, it was to McD's for breakfast for the rest of our vacation. The lobby is bright and attractive, however, the rooms are another story, scary is an appropriate word to use."
45,997,"Aug 14 2005	Pleasantly Surprised	I stayed here for 2 nights, and I must say, that I found it to be not only convenient to transportation buses and underground and heathrow express, but I also found it more spacious then I expected. It was clean,and bed was comfortable, the TV had good reception and adequate channels. I found the reception desk very helpful and the only complaint I have was had to pay for breakfast and it wasn't that great. But I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it. Especially if you need the heathrow express."
46,997,"Jul 10 2005	nice hotelneed more staff!	We stayed here as we were attending Live 8 in hyde park. Location is great, 2 minutes walk from the heathrow express and the same to Hyde Park. Room was very clean and a fair size.We were pleasantly surprised !Only drawback I would say was the fact that they had no dedicated bar person. The guy who checked us in was also in charge of the bar which left us waiting for drinks whilst people checked in. He also decided not to open the bar on the Saturday night which was a bit of a disappointment as we were looking forward to a wee nightcap after the concert. He told us he was too busy and didn't have the staff to enable him to open the bar. If there were more staff here then I would definitely stay here again."
47,997,"May 8 2005	Lovely hotel	We stayed for two nights in a triple room which was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We found the staff to be very helpful and courteous.The hotel was situated in a delightful tree lined square very convenient for Paddington Station and also a fifteen minute walk up Edgware Road to Marble Arch/Oxford Street. The breakfast room was very pleasant and the staff attentive. There was a good choice in the continental breakfast selection and the full english breakfast was very good.We would definitely stay in this hotel next time we come to London for a short break."
48,997,"Apr 28 2005	Excellent Hotel	We spent 4 nights at this hotel between our trip to South Africa and our return to Toronto. Our room was basic but very clean. We had a bright twin room on the first floor which was non smoking, overlooking a little park. The TV had numerous channels, there was also a Tea and coffee maker. The toilet although small had a very good shower and bath. The Continental breakfast was most satisfying with a choice of cereal, yogurt, cheese, meat, rolls and a pot of tea or coffee. This could be upgraded to a full English breakfast for a couple of pounds.The hotel was within easy reach of Paddington Station. We actually walked all the way to Trafalgar Square , Oxford Circus and along the Mall to Buckingham Palace. The staff were very helpful and gave us a map where they marked all the places that we wanted to visit. There were many good restaurants and shops within a few minutes of the hotel. We loved the Fish and Chip shop at the end of the road.Beware of Discount Theatre Ticket sellers. Make sure that you know the actual price of the ticket and their commission . We paid 90 pounds for 2 tickets which were only worth 20 pounds each."
49,997,"Mar 19 2005	Great for the money!!	I just returned from a 4 night stay at the Norfolk Plaza and was very pleased with what I got for my money. I was booked into a single room, but put into a twin room (had prepaid with expedia). The room and bathroom (tub with shower) were larger than I expected. It was not fancy, but clean and comfortable.I didn't think the breakfast was worth the price, but I was only getting the buffet and don't eat meat. The only internet access was dial-up and it was very slow dial-up. That said, for the price it was a great place to stay and I would definitely stay there again. It's a great location for both places to eat and Paddington Station."
50,997,"Mar 5 2005	Pleasantly Surprised	We chose the Norfulk Plaza because it had the best reviews of the hotels offered by the tour company we were using.. We chose it with fear and trembling because it had mixed reviews and we had no experience with Eurpoean hotels but had not heard great things. We were pleasantly surprised. We were please with our accommodation, a front room on 2nd floor. The room was clean, we had plenty of towels and hot water. The room would get a little warm occasionally but the windows opened so there was no problem. We had closet space, a small desk and chest and 2 chairs. The bath was small but not uncomfortably so and had a tub/shower combination. The location was very handy to Paddington Station. We had the &quot;Continental Breakfast&quot; which was rolls with butter and jelly, ceral, juice and coffee or tea. We did find it interesting that our only problem was communication. We are English speaking only and I don't believe that English was the first language for anyone working in the hotel. Every employee was always polite and courteous; we just had trouble understanding and being understood when we had questions.I rated the hotel 3 because it was average in comparison to similar accommodations in America. I would stay there again and I would recommend it."
51,997,"Mar 1 2005	Terrible!	This hotel is just terrible if you get a room in the basement. This is our worst stay in a hotel ever. The room was cold with a wet and unpleasant air. I must say that I have experienced more comfort in a tent in - 10 degrees Celsius then this room. In addition, we only got a useless and a dirty blanket.When we turned on the radiator the temp was ok but the bathroom was still very cold. However, the next morning the room was extremely cold again. When I informed the staff that the radiator didnt work anymore they told me that the heating system had a timer. I explained that it was too cold in the room without the heating on and ask them not to turn it off. The next night they kept the heating system on for a bit longer time but turned it off again during the night. Although the lobby was great and the hotel looked ok besides of the rooms in the basement. The breakfast was also ok.The location is great!"
52,997,"Feb 25 2005	Good Location	I stayed here one night for a Business Trip on 23 Feb 05.It has a great location for the Heathrow express at Paddington and thats why i chose it.It is a bog standard 3 star hotel, it aint the Hilton and it aint a Hostel. The reception and downstiars bar are misleading as they are modern, bright and pleasent. The rest of the Hotel is tired, a little rickety and not as pleasent. My room was clean and comfortable, mini bar and TV, trouser press all excellent, small bathroom a down side.Overall this Hotel will be acceptable or not depending on the price. I think any more than 75 per night is too much for what you get. Staff, breakfast and location spot on, if you want trendy decor and bright modern living then dont book a room, sleep in the reception or bar area!"
53,997,"Feb 24 2005	Avoid if you can; enjoy if you can't	We stayed in this hotel for five nights 1/19-1/24/2005 in two different rooms. The first room, , a double, booked through Expedia, was on the top floor and very small -- but clean. It had no view and was rather claustrophobic.Due to a change in our travel plans, we needed to stay for another three nights in London. We looked to alternative hotels in the area and elsewhere -- but decided to stay in the same hotel. Booking directly with the hotel, we were offered a better room on a slightly higher rate which included breakfast. The room and breakfast was acceptable.Hence the first recommendation: If you decide to stay in this hotel, book directly and ask for a better room.More generally, having stayed and inspected different hotels in London over the last quarter century, I should say that it is very difficult to get a good-sized hotel room in London at a reasonable price.Upon my return, I noted that it is possible to get rooms in better hotels for the same price through priceline.In conclusion, due to its location near Paddington, friendly staff and clean rooms, this is an acceptable choice for budget travellers to London."
54,997,"Jan 21 2005	Dissapointing room	Stayed for one night due to its good reviews and budget price (60 quid for the night). Arrived at 13:30 (which is only 30 mins before correct check in time) and was told to wait for 30 mins before the room was ready. The hall entrance looks very nice but the room we got was far from it, very small, not great furniture and very basic. Not bad location, but the entrance hall is certainly more impressive than the rest of the place!!"
55,997,"Nov 16 2004	Great price/location combo!!!	My wife and I just returned from a 2-week trip to Europe where we spent time visiting London, Paris and Rome. While in London we stayed at the Norfolk Plaza, and I have to say that we were very pleased with the accomodations. We paid approx. $120 a night (before taxes) for the stay, so obviously we weren't expecting a 5 star hotel. The front desk attendants and staff were all very pleasant to work with and the room was very decent and clean. It was close to Paddington Station, and there are lots of restaurants and shops in the general area to visit. What do you get @ the Norfolk Plaza - great location, somewhat small but very decent room, 13&quot; television, nice and clean bathroom, and there are non-smoking rooms available.What don't you get @ the Norfolk Plaza - 5 star accomodations, a great view from your room (we had no view)."
56,997,"Sep 28 2004	Norfolk Plaza - great location	This hotel met our needs very well. My husband, nine-year old daughter, and myself were booked in a clean, non-smoking triple room. The hotel is 2 blocks from Paddington Station, which made going anywhere in London simple. Hyde Park was a few blocks walk and there were modest restaurants, bakeries and grocers within a block.Our room had no view, but those facing the street get a beautiful view of the square. We never used the dining room, so I cannot vouch for breakfast, but the place was clean, with working plumbing and electric, and fresh linens daily. I would recommend this hotel, and would stay here again.One cautionary note...the fire alarm went off a couple of times the first night/day. We later realized that this was because someone down the hall was smoking on the floor - despite it being posted as Non-Smoking. A complaint to the front desk got rid of the problem."
57,997,"Sep 17 2004	Great Find!	After cycling in Holland for week and living on barge, the Norfolk Plaza Hotel was a welcomed surprise. Located just a few blocks from Paddington, it was convenient and very quiet. It's on a small tree lined street and there are some excellent restaurants in the area. The small bar was a nice place to relax at the end of the day. The staff was pleasant and the room was clean and comfortable. I got a rate on the Internet for $80 per night and considering some of the dives I have stayed at for over $100, I couldn't believe my luck. I would highly recommend this property."
58,997,"Aug 16 2004	Get what you pay for	Stayed here for weekend in August 2004, booked last minute. The rate on their Website and on many of the &quot;book your hotels&quot; website was 70 per night excl breakfast. As their site had no secure boooking form I rang them and persuaded them to give me a double room with breakfast for 55 ! It's right beside Paddington but far enough away from the noise, room was OK, clean but the mini bar didn't work, all drinks very warm. Bathroom was clean with plenty of towels. It was damn hot and there was a large fan in my room when I arrived, which did help me sleep. Window wouldn't open though. All round, for 55 and location it was quite good. (Didn't have breakfast as it was only a buffet, went out instead !). Yes I'd stay here again if I got the same rate or may be upto 20 more."

Very close to the tube which made London easy to get around. When we needed a taxi one call on our behave and top notch it was. Driver was friend and easy to talk to. I would stay again."
2,998,"Oct 31 2009	Nice little hotel	A small hotel near the Notting Hill area with only about 25 (?) rooms. We (three adults) stayed there for 5 days. We got the room on the 5th floor and there was no elevator so the trek upstairs with our three luggages was not fun. Location was very convenient - about a 3-5 min walk from Notting Hil Gate Station or the Queensway tube station. Just steps from the hotel is a bus stop, so you are only a bus ride away from places like Oxford Street and Picadilly Circus (take bus 94) and the British Museum (bus 390). It's also within walking distance to Kensington Garden and Portabello Road. Breakfast was provided in the morning but don't expect anything fancy. It was hard boiled eggs, toast with jam/butter, milk, fruit juices, coffee and tea. Breakfast room is really small, and depending on when everybody else gets up, may get a little crowded, so you may have to line up to get into the room. And even if you get sick of their breakfast there are decent places around the Notting Hill Gates tube station (ie. Pret-a-manger, EAT) just down the street.The room was a little small, but at least everything was clean. We were mostly out and about and was mainly looking for a place to crash after a long sightseeing. Staff was friendly and helpful. The street was a dead-end street so there isn't as much traffic as a main street, so it was pretty quiet at night. Our only complaint was there was no remote control in our room on our arrival and it took a while to figure out which remote control worked in our room. Overall we are satisfied with this place and would recommend this to others."
3,998,"Sep 23 2009 	never will stay at this hotel again!	Booked a single room. When I arrived, it turned out there is no toilet in this room! The administrator kept telling me, but it has a shower, like it is enough. The single room itself bears no critic. I canceled my reservation and found another hotel nearby."
4,998,"Sep 17 2009 	Nice and clean and very good location	Stayed here with 3 family members friday the 11th Sept for 3 nights. Had room 15. Hotel is nice, bedrooms were very clean. You literally are 5mins walk away from Regents and Hyde Park where Kensington Palace is located. Ony a few negatives on the hotel that is that they do not have a safety deposit box in the bedrooms or behind reception for holding your money and passport. The breakfast room is absolutely tiny and its in reception. There is about 5 tables, breakfast runs from 7.30-9.30am.....best advice is to go down around 8.30 as you wont be able to get a seat after this. Didn't spend too much time in the hotel as was out all day. But I would recommend it as its cheap, its not the Ritz but it is good all the same. Also it has no restaurant, so its not really a hotel in that sense. Oh yeah and it has no elavator so its abit of a trek up them stairs.lol"
5,998,"Aug 13 2009 	Very very nice place	Went there for a 4 days trip with my boy-friend.Really nice, quite hotel, unluckily at the last floor without lift, but it was worth it.Clean, quite, we were lucky: we got a 4 persons room for 2, so the room was big enough... but the guy at the reception said we were lucky as the rooms for 2 are small...The bathroom was completly new, there was a flat TV in the room, a kettle and so.Nothing to say, really nice, some restaurants around, a Tesco at 5 min walk, as far as a metro station.I highly recommend it !!"

9,998,"Jun 22 2009 	Excellent value for money	Excellent 4 nights, paid 45 punds per night including brekfest, location is very good, rooms very clean and service good. Breakfest included bread, eggs and cerials, but that was just extra for the price we paid. Recommend to everyone!"
10,998,"Jun 7 2009 	Nice hotel	This hotel is not too expensive and it is a nice place to stay. Location is perfect. With Notting Hill tube station only 2 min. from the hotel most attractions in London can be reached in 15-20 minutes.The room we got (Room 21 on the top floor) was very small and could just about fit the bed. But as we only needed to sleep there it didn't matter much. The only problem with the room was that there was no lock on the window. It could be opend form the outside and there was access from the roof. We pointet this out a number of times at the reception but they didn't fix it. The hotel can't be recomended for people who has problems with walking on stairs, as most of the rooms requires a lot of stair climbing.Breakfast &quot;buffet&quot; is very basic - bread, butter, jam, muesli and tea or coffe - but there are lots of nice places to eat breakfast nearby."
11,998,"Jun 1 2009	Ideal location for London Tourists. Nice cute neighbourhood near Kensington Park	We paid about 45 Pounds per night (late May2009) which included a continental breakfast. The hotel is located at the heart of Notting Hill. Only four minutes to Subway Station Notting Hill Gate, 5 minutes to Kensington Park. There are plenty of restaurants near by. Don't expect too much. It is a cute little hotel in a street like in the movie Notting Hill. It was clean but we had a room downstairs. You can see that the personell is trying to keep this place clean. For people that do a London trip and just need a place to sleep this hotels is perfect."
12,998,"May 24 2009 	Decent and affordable accomodation	This hotel had its ups and downs but overall, our stay there was uneventful and I think we had a pretty decent rate and location.I had originally booked a single room for a 5-night stay, but a friend decided to join me in London at the last minute. Upon arrival at the hotel, the receptionist wasn't too pleased about this and wondered how on earth we'd stay in a single room for the first night. He was then very helpful and managed to accomodate us in a double room for the remainder of our stay. The rate he gave us was lower than the double room rate, he said.Upon arriving at the single room (room number 13!), we understood why he was wondering: the room had the size of a walk-in closet, with barely any room to open or store a suitcase, but at least it had a shower (shared bathroom downstairs). And it was quite clean and quiet and with free Wi-Fi Internet. Let's just say it was an interesting first night. The double room (room number 2) had a large bed and private bathroom and was also clean, but a bit noisier, as it was at the front of the hotel. The doors of the rooms would have the tendency to slam and our neighbours often didn't pay attention to this.The front desk clerk wasn't too enthusiastic about the free breakfast when we described it, but once there, it turned out to be tasty and reasonable, although not too filling: toast, cereal, milk, orange juice, coffee or tea and, if you were lucky, hard-boiled eggs.The location of the hotel is good: near the Notting Hill Gate tube station, where it's easy to get around London via the Central, Circle, and District lines. There are a few restaurants in the area, but my friend and I often found ourselves buying bread, cheese, fruit and pasta salads at the nearby Tesco supermarket. We haven't had a chance to see the Portobello Market, but I guess that would be a nice alternative too.The staff were overall polite and helpful. One morning, we were still in the bedroom at around 11 AM when the maid knocked on our door and politely asked if we needed anything, such as a change of towels (instead of rushing us to leave). My friend needed to print his e-ticket for our flight home and the front desk clerk did this for him free of charge.The only really annoying things about this place were: their policy to pay up front for the entire stay, the surcharge of 4% (?) had we decided to pay with a credit card (we ended up paying cash) as well as the dodgy-looking receipt that I got at the end of the stay, and ONLY because I asked for once.Otherwise, it's a pretty decent and affordable accomodation in a city known for its expensive hotels!"
13,998,May 20 2009 	Great location basic hotel	Stayed here 11th til 14th of May.Great location 2mins from tube. very basic room. we were in roon 1 and the path outside the hotel was jus above our heads when in bed so was bit noisy but bearable.great price for such a well located hotel.glad we comprimised standard for location.we didnt spend much time in room as were out sightseeing whole time. wouldnt reccommend if planing on bein in room a lot.staff werent that friendly.they werent rude but just werent the friendliest.breakfast was included but didnt have it any of the mornings as got up too late but because price so cheap didnt care.
14,998,Apr 16 2009 	excellent value for money	stayed here with my husband in march found beds and rooms spotless staff very friendly and breakfast was value for the price we paid for our room.close to tube station and pleasant area i felt very safe walking here at nite only down side breakfast room is quite small for the number of guests but all in all excellent value for money
15,998,"Mar 7 2009 	Dont have room 6	I just got back from a 3 night stay here,only have a couple of negative points, the positives - the staff were friendly and the room was cheap as chips, clean and in a good location.problems - we had room 6 which is right next to the entrance and also the breakfast room.So basically you get woken up anytime someone comes in and also whenever everyone else is up and having breakfast your up.Also the fact that there was never any space for us in the Breakfast room because it was always full up so we never once had any breakfas at this hotel"
16,998,"Mar 5 2009 	Easy affordable and comfortable	Myself ( a student) and three friends found this place for cheap and preferred it to the youth hostel.so glad we did. the room was smaller than we imagined and a bit hot but cosy and very comfortable for our 2 nights.We didnt spend much time in the room, returning to sleep and taking full advantage of the complementary breakfast which was adequate. For our uses it was perfect, great transport links, close to restaurants and bars and a great price.Next time we come to london we will definately returning, a great find and a suprising bargain..."
17,998,"Dec 9 2008 	For the price we paid we loved it!	It was a last minute grab of any hotel since I was running out of time. Thankfully I made the right choice!The rooms were cozy with a touch of class. The place must have been newly refurbished since everything was just clean and in place. I think for the price we paid, we had a good deal. Did not expect anything close to this since the previous hotel we stayed in Paddington wasnt up to mark.Just less than 10 mins walk from Notting Hill tube, u can grab Starbucks on the way and dont even realize you've reach the hotel. The guys manning the front desk were helpful too and accomodated our requests.I'd recommend this hotel anytime to my friends!"
18,998,"Nov 21 2008 	They shouldn't use this as a bedroom!	The rest of the hotel may be nicer but I can only write from my experience and being put in the front room with light curtains (room permanently looks like its 7am, very confusing when you wake in the night), but worst of all its right next to the heavy click clack door that can only be opened by ringing the bell to attract the receptionists attention. Also when staff arrive early in the morning they stand around and have a nice little inconsiderate chat with each other just outside the room.I think they should find some other use for this particular room. If you get room 6...just leave."
19,998,"Oct 27 2008 	ok but don't stay here for too long!	on the plus side, the notting hill gate is reasonably priced, and it's on a residential street where there isn't a lot of noise at night. we chose it because you can quickly travel to paddington for the heathrow express, and quickly get to central london. and you can walk to portobello road, hyde park and a few other places. we arrived well before the check-in time, left our bags, and the staff were happy to get our room ready so we could be let in early.we stayed for 3 nights and it was fine. but there were quite a few things that would have become tiresome on a longer stay. we were on the third floor, and there are no lifts. the hot water ran out a couple of times. but the hardest thing was the room being so tiny - there was nowhere to sit apart from on the bed, and hardly any space to put the bags. even making a cup of tea was tricky because of being so cramped. and the bathroom was impossibly small. you'd have to be really short and skinny to feel comfortable here for more than a couple of days.next time i need a london hotel i will probably hope to find something a little better. but i wouldn't mind coming back here for one or two nights, if i get a good price."

1,999,"Nov 20 2009 	Disgrace!	Not worth going into detail, just don't stay here.As I left I said to the receptionist 'this place is horrible' she replied 'I know'"
2,999,"Jul 16 2009 	Don't even go there	The hotel is in good location, but that's about it. The room we have been in was absolutely terrible, cartons hanging off, dirty and i wasn't even brave enough to open to wardrobes. The Bathroom was even worse. I would rather pay extra and stay in clean room."
3,999,"Jun 1 2009 	Don't stay here...really!!	I don't know where to start...the room is small but this is OK for London, the bathroom was disgusting, the amount of mold in the tile and the shower doors was horrible...the location is excellent but is not worth a penny!! the staff was nice and the breakfast was only toast, coffee, juice, salami and cheese...Yes it was cheap to stay here but really if this is a business and they want people to come back they should clean a little better, there is no need for mold in the bathrooms, chlorine will clean this..."
4,999,"May 3 2009 	It ruined my marathon experience	WE booked this a long time ago and at a very cheap rate. We booked 3 doubles for our family, and the night before (11pm at night) the hotel phoned to say that they had problems with plumbing and could they put us up in another hotel or a family room. I was running the London Marathon the next morning, and so sleeping with my mum, dad and sister was not high on my list of relaxing things to do prior to the marathon. When we arrived at the hotel they said there was no other room in London (which Im sure they were right about being London Marathon weekend) and they made us take the family room for 4 of us. We requested a discount for this and they refused stating that we had a very cheap rate anyway. (They did give us a family room the next night to compensate us) . The staff were very friendly, but there was also no option of me getting breakfast before 7am - again another nightmare before a marathon! Talking about the breakfast, that was appalling, hardly any choice and not enough seats. The Sunday morning I spent 15 minutes sat on the stairs waiting for a table. The receptionist desk is also squashed in this tiny breakfast room, It strikes me that the owners of this hotel are very greedy. The rooms were tiny.To be honest this hotel was really cheap - but I think if it was marketed more as a hostel rather than a hotel we would have been less offended."
5,999,"Apr 8 2008 	not good	We paid an exceptionaly cheap 120 for 2 nights bed and breakfast. A friend of mine booked it last minute but did not check the reviews. Have got to say that the only reason we stayed was not to offend my friend. This is the most tired place I have ever stayed. The receptionist bareley uttered a word then we were given our keys. As the lift only held one person at a time we made our way up the stairs. This was like climbing a mountain. Once we entered the room we were overcome by a damp smell. The bathroom looked like it had not been updated since the 1940s and was in need of replacing. The whole hotel is grey, grey, grey. In the morning we went down for breakfast. Continental?? 10 slices of plastic cheese, toast, tea and coffee.The saving grace was our location. Notting hill is a great location with plenty of nice bars and restaurants. Part of our group stayed in the Comfort inn which is about 10 doors up the road and for an extra 15 per night seemed by far the better option. ."
6,999,"Mar 13 2007 	Nice staff shame about the room	I agree with cornish_pastie's review about the room features... Impossible to close the window as the handle didn't work. In any case as the room was overheated and there was a plumbing problem making the room smell damp, it didn't really matter. On the other hand, the staff are friendly and the breakfast is basic but OK. Check your credit card bill afterwards as they had already charged for the room before arrival!"
7,999,Sep 13 2006 	More Nottinghill Hostel than Hotel	My friend &amp; I stayed here over the Bank Holiday weekend in August as we were attending the Notting Hill Carnival.They put the prices up by 10 due to the fact of it being the Carnival- so we ended up paying 65:00 per room per night.We were quite disappointed with the layout of the hotel - very old fashioned with lots of strairs which were steep- the staff offered us the use of the lift there but it was so tiny and old we decided to use the stairs- as we were afraid that it might break down.The room was poor quality and very small. The beds were soft so I had an uncomfortable nights sleep there. The towels which they provided were old and messy. The bathroom was okay in size but the shower was too small - we both ended up with bruises and I hit my head on the tap a number of times. Room needs to be painted despartely and new furniture needs to be provided. It reminded me of an homeless hostel or bed and breakfast- I have been in a few in my line of work and I can say that this accommodation was on par with what is offered there.If you do go there please expect poor standard of accommodation!The only saving grace of the place was that the staff were very helpful and accommodating.
8,999,Aug 25 2006 	Can only laugh!	Remember the price! I kept saying to myself.....It is surely one of the cheapest stays in central London you'll find.I stayed with my wife and MiL for a couple of nights.The room was oh so tired - not dirty - just tired!The shower room was 'amusing' - it had a false floor in there but the toilet was clearly fixed to the original floor so you had a bit of a 'drop' to sit down and ended up with your knees a lot higher than you might be accustomed too!The bed side lamps were all hard wired so unless it was a bulb gone they couldn't easily sort out a reading light.The wiring generally looked a bit suspect with ceiling roses missing.But it was so bad it was good and we couldn't stop laughing each time some other quick came to light.But to put up 3 people within 5 min walk of the tube at what are basically hostel prices.With more notice you can get modern fresh rooms at something like the Travelodge but without the 'character'.Didn't even see the dining room!
9,999,"May 30 2006	Very Disappointing.	We stayed there May 2006.I know this is a fairly inexpensive hotel but even so; the wash hand basin was broken &amp; patched up, the toilet cistern was hanging off the wall, the curtains were hanging by approx. 4 rings, the bedlinen was grubby, the furniture looked like it was from a 2nd hand shop &amp; the breakfast was a joke!The positives;the staff were helpful and the location was good.We would never stay there again."
10,999,Apr 24 2006	Decent for the money	After a lot of research we believe this hotel was about all we could expect for the money in London. The staff made every attempt to accomodate us and the room was small (aren't they all in London?) but clean and properly made up each day. The location is great - a short walk from the Notting Hill Gate tube station. The only difficulty we encountered during our 6 day stay was from a bunch of noisy people next door who arrived at 2 am. The staff people called them immediatly and the problem was taken care of in reasonable time.
11,999,"Feb 7 2006	quiet nice	stayed there for 3 nights. the service was nice, the room was clear and the hotel was quiet too. the tube station is not far away. the people working there were helpful to give some hints for singhtseein. for 150 pound it was very good ! breakfast was good too !"
12,999,Jan 14 2006	Not that bad	I really don't understand all the people complaining about this hotel. I arrived with my party (of 5 people) in the middle of the night. We were welcomed by a very friendly person in the reception asking if we were hungry offering to order food for us. Our sleeping arrangements were a bit special and the hotel really had taken care that our requests would be met. I've stayed in hotels in London a couple of times before and paid more for rooms with less standard than in this hotel.
13,999,"Jan 2 2006	Nice	Its a nice hotel, friendly staff, clean...For a 2star hotel, and the price that i've paid I was really satisfied with the room and the service"
14,999,"Sep 1 2005	Nightmare hotel	I have stayed in hotels in many parts of the world (first through to third world) and have genuinely never stayed in a hotel so lacking in respect for its patrons. Three years ago, I went to NH carnival and booked in here; it sounded ideal. Whilst I gave my credt card details in good faith (their surety in case I didn't show), it was accepted that I would pay by cheque for my three nights stay - 180-ish pounds? Upon arrival, I was required to pay for my accommodation in advance which I did by cheque - only to find out subsequently that 500 had already been deducted from my credit card on the night I booked. It took my credit card company (Barclaycard) one day short of the three months time limit to recover the money. The hotel itself was awful, a tiny double room where the door banged against the bed so only one person could get into the room at a time, the skirting boards were missing, the toilet seat was on the floor, there were cracked and dirty tiles in the bathroom ... the list could go on. Breakfast for the hardy, was a jar of instant coffee, electric kettle, mugs, electric toaster, set out on a table in the cavern-like basement (ugh!). Ok if you had signed up for a hostel but the Notting Hill Hotel sold itself as better than that.The one point in its favour was the location."
15,999,"Jul 19 2005	Notting Hill - not a good choice...	We decided to save some money when booking this hotel. The pictures on the website looked really nice, but the hotel we found upon arrival was nothing like those pictures.I agree when people say you can't compare 4 and 5 star hotels to a hotel like this hotel, but there are some basic standards (clean, friendly service, a decent breakfast) any hotel should meet up too, especially when you're charged 55 Pounds per night!Rooms were old-fashioned, we looked out of the window straight into a wall, the bathroom was very small, sheets were dirty. The room was small; too small to really be there and feel comfortable.A first also was instant-coffee at breakfast...We were asked to pay for our whole stay upon arrival, which we can understand; if we had had a chance, we would have cancelled our stay within 10 minutes from the moment of arrival...."
16,999,"Jan 26 2005	awful	This hotel is simply terrible. I stayed with 4 friends in two rooms. They were damp, had mould growing, smelt awful. Do not go there even on a tight budget!!!!!"
17,999,"Jun 20 2004	Seven night at Nottin Hill Hotel	I had stayed at Notting Hill Hotel, at first time I was realy worry about coments in this website, but when I arrived I realized Notting Hill Hotel is very friendly, not luxurius, but clean, warm and very nice and safe area, rooms are clean, brights.I would recomend this small hotel if you want to spend holidays traveling around London in a quiet enviroment and reasonable rates at this familiar hotel.Also Iwould like to say I'd travelled a lot I've stay in differents hotels , but I can not understand some people who sayd&quot; we were at Ritz Hotel &quot;how they can even compare a small and friendly hotel with the cold Ritz and then decide stay and on the top insult and ofend on this way. Pedro Martin,Madrid,Spain"
18,999,"Jan 27 2004	Bad bad bad...	This is by far the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. We couldn't get up early enough in the morning so we could get out of the place and stayed out as long as we could in the night. It was damp, dirty, smelly and cold. It was not possible to flush the toilet and it was growing mould in the shower and over the bed!"
19,999,"Jan 10 2004	Disgusting - stay if you're a pyschopath or drug user	I stayed at the Notting Hill Hotel for 4 nights and I have to say it is THE most disgusting, depressing, smoke filled, dirty, unsanitary hotel that I've ever stayed in my entire life. You're talking to a world traveller here that has stayed in many a friend of a friends house, hostel, campgrounds, and the Ritz. The Notting Hill hotel is in a GREAT location, absolute wonderful area of the city - BUT I caught a terrible skin rash from my bed and I still have it to this day to remind me of that gross hotel. The resturant is deep in the basement, it looks like a place that pyschopaths would go to perform killings - it's just one of those &quot;trust me&quot; situations - PLEASE STAY AWAY from this gross hotel. Pay a few dollars (yen, quid, euro, whatever) and have some pride in yourself and stay someplace else."
20,999,Dec 17 2003	Damp and dreary	We stayed at this hotel for 2 days and won't be going back. But what should I expect for 49 quid a night in London. Even though the staff were very friendly it could not save the experience we had there. As soon as I walked into the roon there was a stench that was absolutely awful and could only be escaped by constantly lighting up cigarettes to drown out the smell. There was mould in the shower and we could hear the conversation of our neighbours at all times. I would not recommend this hotel even though the location was ideal!!!!

1,1000,Nov 19 2009 	Nice hotel in a very good location - great for business or pleasure	I stayed here just for one night in November. Got a rate of 175 room only via Late Rooms which I thought was expensive - but this is central London.Hotel is well equipped. Rooms are really nice with a good bathroom/shower and separate toliet. They've done a good job in designing the rooms to maximise space without sacrificing the square footage so the rooms feel spacious.Good in room entertainment and otherr amenities as you'd expect but the clincher really is the location.Good bar (fairly expensive) and restaurant with very impressive communal areas/reception.You are a few minutes from some of the nicest parts of London. Fantastic for tourists and very accessible for business - a five minute walk from Tower Bridge.
2,1000,"Nov 14 2009 	Great location and excellent value	We will be going back, which is surely the best recommendation. The main feature is the location; very near the Tate Modern, Globe, Millenium Bridge, St. Pauls - not far to walk to the Tower of London in the other direction. Round the corner from Clink St, Southwark Cathedral and Borough market - lots of atmosphere in this area.With the Novotel you know what you are going to get; which is a major advantage when trying to source a reasonably proiced hotel in London - there are a lot of dodgy hotels at the lower end of the budget scale. Rooms are well equipped; breakfasts are plentiful and good quality; prices are excellent especially when travelling with kids. OK, the rooms are not excatly spacious when the sofabed is down for the kids - but who wants to come to London with kids and stay in the hotel room?"
3,1000,"Nov 9 2009	Avoid this strange place	I have just returned from this hotel after a leisure weekend in London booked with Edwards Coach tours. What a fiasco! The room booking plainly stated &quot;twin&quot;. When we arrived we found one double bed, so went to reception to ask to change. To say I was met with a response more appropriate from Hitler himelf would be an understatement. The receptionist was abrupt, rude, unhelpful and tried to make me feel grateful that i had accommodation at all never mind the wrong type of room. She spoke to me as if I were a naughty child, and was adamant there was nothing she could do (more like nothing she would do!!) Eventually we got them to make up the sofa bed that was in the room, but again when i raised a question about the rather dubious comfort of this her answer to everything was No! NO! NO! NO! I rather think it was a new word she had used that day and was practising!Taking her out of the equasion the room itself was not really satisfactory. There are no doors on the wardrobe. the toilet is separate from the bathroom, so you have to walk the entire length of the room to wash your hands after using the toilet, and, with no disrespect intended a person of large build would have great difficulty in such a small toilet cubicle. Most unsatisfactory. The rooms do have a safe and iron with ironing board which i suppose is one redeeming feature.Breakfast was tasty and plentiful and the service was good. However, both the tea and the coffee were disgusting. The hotel is close to London Bridge tube but as a frequent traveller to London I have stayed in many hotels in the city. This is postively the worst and i will not be returning. Avoid this at all costs"
4,1000,"Nov 3 2009 	Perfect for viewing fireworks New Years Eve	stopped in this hotel new years eve 2006 and 2007 with 3 kids as its very close to Southwalk Bridge (5mins walk) an ideal viewing spot for the firework display at London Eye. Many families do exactly the same but also the usual crowds celebrating a gather complete with champagne, party poppers etc. Paid part cash part tesco vouchers. The breakfast is self service hot and cold buffet with cerials toast etc Has a pleasant bar who were happy to warm bottles etc for baby. Had complimentary drinks as our room wasnt available until after 2pm and we were disappointed we couldnt get checked in and start sight seeing. Lovely location for Tate Modern, Millenium Bridge etc Had a taxi to British Museum for under a tenner. Parking reasonable considering location, but sometimes barrier is left up and you can come and go for free !!"
5,1000,"Nov 1 2009 	EXCELLENT VALUE 	Stayed here Friday night in October. Booked in advance on a non-refundable tariff and got room for 2 adults and 1 child incl breakfast for 109 which was fantastic value. When we checked in (slightly early, but not a problem) they were only expecting 2 adults. Fortunately our confirmation quoted 2+1 and they put us in a family room, but as the hotel was very busy it was lucky we arrived early. Room had everything you could want or need for both business and pleasure and was very clean, including the carpet (some hotels only seem to vacuum once in a blue moon). Bathroom great, including complimentary toiletries (only need your toothbrush/paste) and a decent sized bathtowel which made a pleasant change. Restaurant was pleasant enough, good service. Excellent value childrens menu although the portions were just ridiculously large for a child - I would have struggled to eat the pasta main course myself. Breakfast was plentiful and lot's of choice, although it paid to get there a bit early as the queue by 9am was long. 20 mins free internet access should you want it, plus some sort of xbox/wii in reception for kids. Only a 5 minute walk from London Bridge tube, and the city was 5 mins away across Southwark Bridge. As London Bridge is on the Jubilee line it was very useful for the 02 (although I'm not sure it's running at weekends at the moment)."
6,1000,Oct 20 2009 	Family friendly but not romantic	We stayed here with our four children for three days in October. There are lots of good points about this hotel and a few negative. The hotel is family friendly (children eat free for breakfast) with a kids menu. The hotel was close to London Bridge tube station(about 10 mins walk). They allowed us to store our luggage in the luggage room on our last day so we could do some more sightseeing. The rooms were cheap considering we had to book two rooms...good value really. However the rooms are SMALL. It is certainly not a hotel to go to if you want a romantic weekend. Our two rooms were not connected and this disappointed us. The reception lady seemed happy that the two rooms were on the same floor!! The other complaint we had was that they came in very early to make the rooms up each day..sometimes at 8am! Overall though it is a good value hotel for families with cheap rooms at a 4 star level.
7,1000,"Oct 19 2009 	Great hotel would definately recommend	After travelling 24 hrs plus I was very excited to check in early. The place is very nice and close to a number of things including London Bridge station, red bus pick etc. The restuarant is great, I can't say a bad thing, we ate there every night as the food and prices were fantastic, kids menu is a plus!! Staff were very friendly and helpful."
8,1000,"Oct 12 2009 	perfect utility accommodation	We needed somewhere convenient to stay the night &amp; have breakfast following an evening wedding reception. Novotel fitted the bill perfectly. The check in, the bar and, the next morning, breakfast, as we experienced them, where quick &amp; efficient &amp; friendly. (We can understand how it could be otherwise as it does seem to be a training hotel for the company - enthusiatic but not necessarily very exprienced staff.) The room itself was quiet and had all we needed. Once served breakfast was so relaxing we nearly missed our checking out time. The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the South Bank, in easy walking distance of the Tate Modern and St Paul's. There were families with small children staying but they did not disturb us beyond causing the occasional trip hazard. It is a perfect base for walking the city's sights if your accommodation requirements are purely utility."
9,1000,"Oct 8 2009 	Great design but not well-designed...	I travel to London often on business, but this time was accompanied by my wife and 10-year-old daughter. Most London hotel rooms are small, so was looking for something that could fit 3 reasonably well.Novotel room was tight fit - with double bed and fold-out sofa, barely room for our luggage, so we upgrade to a suite for additional 40 per night (negotiated from 50). the suite was very roomy and came with free internet (regularly 15 per night) and breakfast (30), so it was basically a free upgrade.The pros:- great size suite- convenient location to almost all of London- very modern looking hotelThe cons:- TVs not working - had to call for service twice (eventually fixed)- Internet woes one night (again called for service and fixed)- Not enough outlets - desk had 3 outlets, all in use by TV, cable &amp; router - so couldn't plug in laptop without disconnecting TV- No wireless - had ethernet access to Internet (15 per night) but I like to use Skype on my iPhone for calls, which require wireless. In 2009 no excuse for a hotel not to offer wireless Internet.- The design of the rooms was modern and &quot;looked cool&quot; but not at all practical. Modern sink barely left enough room to place shaving kit. In our initial room (before suite upgrade), the toilet was separate from rest of bathroom, so had to walk to other side of room to wash hands. Just not well laid-out.- Restaurant/room service was mediocre. Plus, one morning asked to buy coffee to take away and they wouldn't do it - could only serve it to eat in.Overall, this was an OK hotel. Once we upgraded to the suite, we were fine and it was reasonably priced for what you get. I'd consider staying here again if they added wireless."
10,1000,"Oct 7 2009 	Nice Hotel Great Location	We stayed at the Novotel in July for a long weekend break to explore the south bank. Hotel was very clean. Staff very helpful and friendly and it was in a great location to get to the places we wanted to visit such as the Tate Modern, Borough Market and the Dali Exhibition. Would definitely stay there again.."
11,1000,"Oct 3 2009 	Lovely hotel with great location	I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel - if you can get a good deal booking on the internet (and I did) it's so worth staying here. Very comfortable, it made my jetlag a breeze when I first arrived in London. The room was huge by London standards, staff were super friendly and helpful, fantastic water pressure in the shower (if you've stayed in London before you may know how rare this can be!), great breakfast with fresh fruit - I'd definitely stay here again!"
12,1000,"Oct 2 2009	City sights in walking distance	Me and my 10 year old son arrived with the Eurostar at London St.Pancras in the afternoon. Tube is possible with two stations nearby, but we had an appointment with the London Eye, so time to check a, no question, black only cab.No time to wait at check-in, a surprise, german girl, nice and friendly secured a room on the 6th floor, immediatelly after weve asked for an upstairs room.Lobby is not that large with a bar and coffee shop and a restaurant on the other side.The room greeted us with a suspicious smell, not really bad, but something like wet and not enough time to go dry again. It was possible to open the windows, we had them open during our city visit and it was ok when were back in the evening.The room itself fitted with well designed modern furniture, carpet floor, what I dont prefer,but spacious enough for the two of us. Also a small working desk with a flat screen TV .Bathroom was fitted with the warm welcomed bathtub, also from the smallish side, but clean and ok so far. The hotel is located near the Riverbank, close to Tate modern and also the London Eye in walking distance. No problems also, when we walked back in the evening. The hotel was fully booked, therefore the breakfast room was to small to cater all the pax, but the buffet style breakfast was ok. There is also a free internet station in the lobby, where we secured seats for the outbound flight on BA.No time to wait at check out, another friendly german girl there, the next tube station reachable within five minutes also with bags."
13,1000,Oct 1 2009 	Great Location - Great Staff	Not a great fan of staying in London but think I have now found a pad that ticks all the right boxes - Great Location 2 minutes from London Bridge an friendly staff. Check in a breeze and a talkative chap from Hungry in the bar. Room good size with Separate Toilet and Bathroom (as in all Novotel's I believe) Breakfast was good with personal TV if you wanted it. I'll be back.
14,1000,"Sep 30 2009 	Nice hotel - but don't expect a good sleep.	At first sight this is a good mid-market London hotel. The rooms are small - made smaller because of the French owners insistence on separating bathroom and toilet - but nicely decorated and furnished. But it fails to deliver one key requirement - a good nights sleep. The pillows are a joke, little more than cushions. They should test those in the nearby Premier Inn. The air conditioning is noisy but switching it off simply leaves you with an overheated room. And for a hotel with a 250 per night rack rate its highly cheapskate - why only 3 milk cartons in a room for two, 4 per night for wi-fi access, only one person on the front desk at peak check in? That said breakfast was good and plentiful. All in all, not up to the standard it should be setting."
15,1000,"Sep 27 2009 	Room Fine - Breakfast a Fiasco	Stayed overnight. Reception staff were excellent. The room was fine. Very clean and everything we wanted. The location was superb. Only a short walk to Borough Market, London Bridge Underground, the Globe etc.But breakfast - my, oh my! The food was fine, if you could get it. No glasses for fruit juice - had to ask and wait until some came.thenNo bowls for cerial - had to ask and wait until some came.thenNo cutlery on the table - had to ask and wait until some came.thenNo plates for hot buffet breakfast - had to ask and wait until some came.thenNo plates for toast - had to ask and wait until some came.Get the picture?We were never asked if we wanted tea or coffee, and when we eventually asked a waiter, he had to collect coffee pots from vacated tables, take them to the kitchen, wash them up, refill them, and then brought us one. By then our meal was nearly over.There is no leadership, and the staff run round like headless chickens, achieving nothing. Such a shame, as the hotel would be good if the breakfast service was only average."
16,1000,"Sep 11 2009 	Super Location great hotel	Stopped for 1 night in hotel for City break. Good location, easy access from underground and good for sightseeing (took us only 20 walk to London Eye in the morning). Rooms bit small , but facilities modern, clean and Breakfast superb, very tempting! Staff polite. Rates bit too expensive even for London, but it is worth it, especially for travellers with children as hotel do not charge extra for kids or their brekfast. We all enjoyed it, will stop again any time."
17,1000,"Aug 18 2009 	Lovely hotel in a fab position!	We stayed here for one night as we wanted to do some sightseeing in London on the way to visit relatives. We have stayed in Novotels before and have always had an enjoyable stay - this was no exception,Lovely, spacious reception area, separate bar and restaurant, plus internet access provided. Check in was trouble-free, and we were provided with a map of London (with money-off vouchers for restaurants and attractions) plus a Tube map when we asked.The room was great - very clean and modern with a compact but attractively-designed bathroom. Plenty of toiletries as well.Breakfast buffet the next morning was good - usual cooked breakfast, plus waffles with maple syrup(yum) plus cereals, toast, croissants etc. We were glad we had come down to breakfast at 8am, however, as the queue for the dining room was reaching around reception by the time we checked out at 9am.Location was excellent - short walk to Tate Modern, plus good range of restaurants. A bit of a walk to the Tube, but not too bad.A very pleasant stay."
18,1000,"Aug 14 2009 	Visit to O2	We stayed in this hotel as part of a package to the O2 so unsure what the true price was. Perfectly located if you are planning a visit to the O2 especially at the moment with the closure of the Jubilee Line at weekend as you can catch the Thames Clipper just a short stroll at London Bridge, which takes you on a pleasant trip directly to the O2.Modern hotel ideally located also for Bankside and the numerous bars and restaurants - this is a very trendy area now - who needs to go across the water?!Nice reception - the room was not huge although the bed settee had been put up for our little one so I would imagine the room size would be good with the bed closed. Unusual layout for bathroom with a separate toilet - very welcome with my husband! Nice shower and separate full size bath. Small mini bar usually priced for London.Breakfast was buffet which we had no complaints about either food or service.Free internet and PC use in the reception - very useful to catch up while awayOverall a good experience which we would certainly use again when visiting London."
19,1000,"Aug 9 2009 	Quality Hotel - Don't think so!	This is a hotel that charges 270 A NIGHT for a double room at off the street prices. Fortunately I was there as part of a package so didn't.. First the good news. The reception area was very nice and the hotel is conveniently placed for Borough market, and London Bridge station.Now to the room.I don't think,so called, quality hotels should have long hairs on the room toilet on arrival, when we both have short hair. I don't think they should have holes in the curtains. I don't think they should have a sink that doesn't drain. I don't think they should have sliding doors on the bathroom that don't. Slide that is. I don't think it should have a queue that meanders around the dining room between the tables at the buffet breakfast, and a toaster at the end of the breakfast 'bar' so that anyone who wants some has to stand about and hold up the whole queue. And I don't think the said breakfast should be virtually cold and so greasy you'd be better off at the cafe near the market. 270 a night. Dreadful!"
20,1000,"Aug 8 2009 	""Does what it says on the tin""	A pleasant and enjoyable stay at the Novotel. We found the hotel convenient and the staff were always friendly and helpful. Room was clean and everything worked well. The bath and separate shower made it easy for the 4 of us. Considering the location, within walking distance of St Pauls, Millenium abridge and a little more distant the London Eye it was exceptional value for money. we breakfasted at cafes around the nearby Borough Market. We slept soundly and the hotel was peaceful and surprisingly quiet. Only downside was problems on Jubilee Line but Northern Line aslo runs through London Bridge station which is closest to hotel.We will certainly use Novotel City South when in London again."
21,1000,"Aug 5 2009 	WONDERFUL HOTEL.... ALL YOU COULD ASK FOR 	We stayed for 2 nights and had the best time in London.Very much thanks to the superb staff and location of this Hotel.The staff are a credit to the Novotel chain and made us feel valued.The buffet breakfast was very good .A great way to start your day before all the sight seeing,Car park at the rear of the Hotel and not too expensive !!!!! Our room was large,modern,clean, well equiped and yet cosy.Thank you Novotel for a great time in London..Robert, Helen.Abigail &amp; Ruth ------Northern Ireland"
22,1000,"Aug 5 2009 	Clean modern and comfortable.	I stayed at this hotel recently with my wife and two young children for two nights.The hotel is clean, modern, comfortable and all of the staff made us feel welcome. It is only a very short walk to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, the Tate modern and across the Millenium Bridge to St Pauls Cathederal.Although it is a bit further to walk it is very pleasant strolling along the south bank to the London Eye and Westminster."
23,1000,"Jul 17 2009 	nice hotel - good service	The Novotel London City South is a really great place to stay. We stayed there for one night. The rooms are quite big, modern and clean. The breakfast is served as buffet. The staff is really nice and helpful. On the day of our departure we were able to leave our backpacks in the hotel after checking out until our final departure. The tube station is about 5 - 7 minutes walk from the hotel."
24,1000,"Jun 28 2009 	a good night's sleep at the city south...	My second stay at this hotel, I have always found that the rooms are spacious and comfortable, I quite like the podlike bath or shower combination. Lack of a trouser press is slightly annoying for business people. The decor is modern, and there is an effective A/C unit. The window blinds work well to keep the light out at night. The beds are fairly comfortable and I enjoyed a good nights sleep which is essential with work early each morning. Staff members were quite friendly and helpful on both occasions. I didn't try the breakfast this stay (June 09) as I found that it was a pretty standard fare. There are lots of little cafes etc round nearby if you prefer different. Agree with the previous reviewers remark about the tube being far from the hotel, its about 10 min away from the nearest tube station- London Bridge Station. However the walk does take in some great places such as Borough market, and then a nice walking distance to the city, or London Bridge area."
25,1000,"Jun 20 2009 	Comfortable and spacious- a gem!	The rooms are spacious and comfortable. I loved the bed which was absolutely plush and comfy. My friend and I had the best sleep in our month long trip throughout Europe.Staff members were also friendly and eager to help. Security was good as access to the lifts required a room card to be swiped through the reader before you could operate the lift.A negative point for some travellers who prefer to travel around London by the tube was that the hotel is a good 10-15 min away from the nearest tube station- London Bridge Station. This might not be ideal for pple with heavy luggage. Southwark station is simply too far away, would take at least 20-25 min to reach."
26,1000,"Jun 9 2009 	Great location for tourist attractions	Five minutes walk away from The Globe , Tate Modern, Borough Market, OXO Tower and the delights South Bank has to offer - great place to stay.Clean and spacious, with parking (c.20 per 24 hours), you cant really go wrong for the price  we had a special weekend rate of under 100.Not a hotel you would want to spend your weeks holiday in  but perfect for a weekend break to see the sights. Friendly and helpful staff  we arrived at midday and despite check-in two hours away we were found a room within minutes.We didnt try the hotel restaurant as far too many options for eating on the doorstep  bar and restaurant seemed rather soulless. Borough Market is literally on the doorstep and is a must visit if youre into food. Try the tapas place on the corner  always packed you cant miss it!We walked for most of our trip - if it's good weather would reccomend walking along the river bank - you see so much more! c.40 minute walk to Millbank and Tate Britain, c.30 minute walk to London Eye and Westminster. 10 mins Tower of London or St Paul's in the other direction!"
27,1000,"Jun 2 2009 	Good location for the South Bank	We decided to stay in this hotel as we had booked a tasting session at Vinopolis which is very near.The hotel is good and the rooms are larger than most you would find in london. I would not stay here for longer than a couple of days though as the wardrobe and storage space is limited. Also I found the mattress too thin to be comfortable. The rooms are clean and have windows you can open, which again in unusual in london.The staff were a bit hit and miss. The night staff gave me the impression they did not want to be there. We did have to change rooms at midnight when we came home as the battery for the door lock had died and they did not handle this as well as they could have but I doubt this happens that often.The bar staff are slow but do produce brilliant cocktails (Not that expensive for london). I had the best Pimms and Lemonade ever (Loads of fruit)Breakfast is excellent with a good choice of both cooked and continential.This is also a good location for the South Bank.I would stay here again if I was visiting the area"
28,1000,May 31 2009 	Nice Hotel not far from South Bank	The Novotel happens to be very convenient for our London offices so is the obvious choice to stay in for that purpose. It is a clean and well appointed hotel with good facilities the only letdown on my visit was the food which I would describe as only average.The hotel is not particularly close to a tube station with London Bridge being the closest and a 5 minute walk away. I have also used the bar for business meetings and the hotel is both welcoming and accommodating.
29,1000,May 28 2009 	Excellent Stay	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on a business trip and would stay at this hotel again. The rooms were clean and well serviced. The staff were polite and helpful and the location is excellent for taxis and public transport. Would highly recommend this hotel for business or leisure.
30,1000,"May 28 2009 	Good place to stay - but not a 4-star hotel	We've stayed at the City South Novotel a few times now, and it basically does what it says on the box. You get a room, you sleep, you have breakfast, you leave. The package is adequate, and for the lack of hassle, I would recommend it to others.The location is good, close to the Thames and riverside walk, with easy access to the sights on the northern side, too. The room is fine, but furnishings and fittings are getting rather worn. Our bed was of the sofa bed variety - which is ok, since the room had two of them and we could use the other one to sit in. The problem is that it was not a particularly comfortable sleep, and it actually is not a particularly comfortable sit, either. We paid in advance for breakfast, and found it to be good value. There is nowhere quite near enough to just step out of the hotel for breakfast otherwise, although you are close to the restaurants by the river and of course about 10 minutes from the Borough Market where everything is available.If you do not fancy venturing out in the evening, the restaurant (and room service by extension) offers a decent selection and it is tasty.Parking is in the courtyard but run by the hotel next door. It is quite cheap by big city standards (20 pounds for 24 hours), so makes bringing your car a decent prospect, and especially if you are arriving from the southern side of the city."
31,1000,"May 22 2009 	Good hotel but didnt give 4* feeling	We stayed here two nights in a family room (2+2) and paid 220 pounds in total plus 35 for parking on the site. For the price we have paid I can only say it was worth the money. This Novotel is 4* and provides all you need.Plusses are the location, just south of Millenium Bridge, so after breakfast you literally walk over to the other side to find yourself at St Pauls Cath.If you would need to pay the full price (quoted 260 pounds per night for a family room) I would think twice!The room is ok but not that spacious, particularly the bathroom. Its entrance is a few inches from your bed. They solved it nice with sliding doors because a regular door wouldn't fit (but this tells you something about the space it provides).Staff at breakfast much have eaten his tongue the night before, because you couldn't understand a word of what they said. They were really a bunch of unhappy people. Now I know I wouldn't like to get up early to serve people breakfast (maybe for a modest pay), so I can understand where it is coming from. STill it ruins your mood if staff cannot be a little more 'alive'. We are not asking for much, only to return a little smile, show us a table, some coffee/tea and then we'll help ourselves from the buffet you know.Having said that, I must add we had a very friendly bartender who tried to entertain you with his own cocktail recipe and he made you feel welcome.If you are travelling with a family and don't mind to take a train into Central London you may wish to consider to stay at Hilton Dartford near the crossing. A double double room is very spacious, breakfast is of a higher standard and we have stayed there for the same money as we paid for Novotel now. The parking fee at Novotel was 35 in total, so this can pay your train tickets from Dartford or Orpington, which only takes you about 25-30 mins. to Central LondonWould I recommend this NOvotel? Well, depends on the price you'd have to pay and the things you would find important at a hotel. It could be both a yes or a no."
32,1000,"Apr 27 2009 	Dont pay higher prices for ""LONDON BRIDGE"" hotels - this is as good as!	We stayed here for 3 nights over the New Years Eve celebrations. I had looked at the London Bridge Novotel to see if we could stay there as it is closer to London Bridge - but it was sold out.As it turned out this hotel was cheaper and less then a five minute walk from the other Novotel at London Bridge. The underground station is also around five minutes away from the hotel on foot. I have been back in London since and stayed in a Hilton in the docklands, and after this Novotel I was seriously disappointed with the overpriced Hilton.Dont be fooled by other hotels charging 50-60 more then this a night. It is in a great location, has nice rooms and good food. It is actually almost on Southwark Bridge which is the bridge adjacent to London Bridge.Stay here - for good value and excellent quality.We found the hotel staff a bit frustrating - you had to ask them everything twice, even in the bar - or indeed 3 times. And on check in and check out they couldnt find my reservation or my Novotel customer card number which was a little frustrating as they kept insisting I must be mistaken even though I had everything documented and with me. I wouldnt let this put me off though."
33,1000,"Apr 16 2009	A very good place to stay in London	Novotel hotel in Southwark Bridge Road, London is a very good place to stay in London at very reasonable tariff. It is also very close to some of the places to go around in London, e.g. The Thames River, The Tower Bridge, St Paul's Chathedral etc. which makes this hotel a very good place to stay if you are a tourist."
34,1000,"Apr 8 2009 	A good clean reliable hotel	This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. It is very handy as it is the right side of the city centre for us as we fly into London City Airport. The other thing I like about the location is that it is close enough to the city for all the attractions to be accessible but far enough from the hustle and bustle to ensure a good nights sleep. We found that a taxi to most of the sights was less than 10 for the 4 of us.Both times we've stayed we have taken a suite as in both cases we were given an exceptional deal. This gave us a master bedroom for the parents and a pull out bed for our 2 daughters. The rooms are very spacious and nicely styled with separate bathroom and toilets. The one thing we did miss on this visit was the children's play area in the lobby which has now been replaced by 2 Apple Macs for internet access- The plus side of this is they are connected to a printer so you can preboard your flights home and print out your tickets.Good, friendly staff and varied breakfast choices top off a really decent hotel."
35,1000,Feb 15 2009 	Well placed for both South bank and the City	I most recently stayed here in January 09 but have stayed here quite frequently for the past four years. The main reason I stay here is that it is in an excellent location. The hotel is located right next to Southwark Bridge which makes it very convenient to get to London Bridge train and tube station and our offices at More London. From London Bridge its only a couple of stops to Canary Warf or a short walk into the city so I can get to either place with a minimum of fuss.The location also makes it very easy to find somewhere nice to go out at night as there are lots of places to get food or a drink round the borough market area or you can easily get on the tube to somewhere in the West end.The hotel itself has always been excellent. It still feels new even though it must have been there for four or five years now. Ive always rooms are functional but well equipped and comfortable with lots of space to do work if needed and a good bathroom and shower. Every time Ive visited the staff have always been really helpful and friendly too providing better service than Ive received at hotels twice the price.When I go down to London for work this is usually my first choice hotel as its always been great value.
36,1000,"Jan 27 2009 	Novotel is Top Notch	Recently spent a week at the Novotel London City South. We had a great time. The hotel is wonderful. The staff were very helpful and informative. Hotel was very clean and we had no problems. Hotel is very convenient to Public transportation. There is a bus stop right outside the door. Also, you can catch other buses directly around the corner, not to mention that the London Bridge Tube Station is about a 5 minute walk. The food in the hotel was very good. The only downside was that the rooms are a bit small. We had 3 people in our party and at times the room was crowded. However, we were on holiday and the last thing we wanted to do was spend time in the hotel room. Room would be perfect for two people. All of London's attractions are fairly close and if you like walking you can get there easily as well. I suggest you take the bus or tube. The biggest bargain in London is the daily pass for all transportation.For 5.60 pounds a day you can ride unlimited on the buses and Tube. When I return to London, I will surly not hesitate to stay at the Novotel London City South again."
37,1000,"Jan 2 2009 	Great value good location and modern	Stayed at the Novotel for almost a week for business. Newer hotel with basic amenities. Very clean rooms and common areas. Not sure if all rooms were built this way, but toilet is located around the corner from the shower and faucet. Not a problem, just a little different.Hotel staff cheery and helpful. In-house gym was very basic but useable. Pub downstairs had a relaxing atmosphere.Close to the tube (about a 5 minute walk) and to the market (5 minute walk). Also very close to the Thames, so great for decompressing after a long day at the office."
38,1000,"Dec 18 2008	Welcoming family break	I stayed here for 3 nights with my wife and daughter, and had an excellent stay. The purpose of the visit was sightseeing. We had a room with double bed and sofa bed. The room was spotless, with a king-sized bed and a full double sofa bed. With the sofabed made up there was not a huge amount of space, but both beds were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was compact but very well designed, with aseperate loo.The reception staff could not have been more welcoming, especially for our daughter. They made the stay memorable for her. They were also well informed and informative regarding theatre bookings and travel arrangements. We did dine in the restaurant and were pleasantly surprised at the quality - however with the various restaurants and bisto's around the corner in Borough Market there were too many other alternatives to try on other evenings, and also for breakfast.The hotel also benefits from on site parking, which is a great convenience - although we arrived, parked up, and didn't use the car again until we left as there is plenty of public transport on the doorstep (Tube and bus).All in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel."
39,1000,"Nov 15 2008 	Average mid-range branded hotel	Novotel does some super hotels, but this one is merely average. I thought the room was rather bland, although it did have everything I needed inc room safe, coffee/tea, toiletries and tissues (but no facecloth), minibar, good tv, etc. There was a decent breakfast with comprehensive choice, although there was a very long queue which really isn't acceptable.The location is good for the South Bank (Tate Modern, Borough Market, etc), but the tube station is quite a walk away. The hotel does have a surface car park."
40,1000,"Oct 29 2008 	Well placed hotel - good value.	We recently stayed at the Novotel for two nights having booked a Theatre Break with Superbreak. We arrived at lunchtime and the room was ready so we could put our luggage straight in before venturing out. The receptionist was very pleasant and helpful.The room was fairly compact for 2 adults and 2 teenage daughters and had one king- size bed and one sofa-bed. We didn't spend a lot of time in it and there was enough room to move around when the sofa-bed was not pulled out, but it was a bit tight when it was made up. The bathroom was again compact with a decent sized shower, small bath and a rather unusual moulded sink. There were plenty of toiletries etc. The toilet was in a separate small room which also housed the ironing board! We had only been in the room a few minutes when the maid appeared with some extra towels and toiletries and asked if everything was okay. We requested some extra pillows and these were brought straight away.There wasn't a lot of storage/hanging space but enough for us as we were only staing 2 nights. Tea. coffee and biscuits were provided and the milk was in the mini-bar.The hotel is a five minute walk from the nearest subway entrance and 10 minutes from London Bridge Station.We walked, or took taxis rather than used the underground and it was only a 10 minute walk to Blackfriars Bridge or twenty minutes along the South Bank to Waterloo Bridge and then another 10 minutes up to Covent Garden and the theatres. The walk was pleasant and I would reccomend a pizza restaurant called &quot;Gourmet&quot; on the South Bank near to the Oxo Tower. We considered the hotel to be well placed for getting to many sights/attractions. Also, there was a M&amp;S express store just round corner for wine/snacks etc.We only had breakfast in the hotel and whilst we didn't have to wait for a table, a queue had formed when we came out, particulary on Sunday morning and although the staff seemed to be working quite hard the clearing of tables etc was quite slow. The breakfast choice was fairly standard - eggs, bacon sausage etc plus cereals, toast, rolls,croissants, juices - the usual stuff. One complaint - the tea/coffe was not very hot - I noticed that pots of both were brought out and put on the side, and then put on tables as guests sat down - not freshly brewed.This was the only complaint with regard to the breakfast.We didn't use the bar or the restaurant at night.The room was very quiet at night and the king- size bed was fairly comfortable.We would stay in this hotel again for a short break but would find the room too cramped to stay for longer than this. I don't think this would be a problem if there were only 2 people in the room."
41,1000,"Sep 9 2008 	Painful Experience....	I stayed at this hotel for a few weeks on a business trip to London. The facility was new at the time, perhaps less than a year old. The hotel was clean and new, with tasteful decor. The staff were all very young, and nearly all were foreign, typically French or Polish. For several, their command of English was poor. When they did not understand what you asked, they often simply nodded, or pretended they understood and then responded incorrectly to your request.The breakfast options were quite large, and you could have as much as you liked. Dinner choices were good, although not always available as they sometimes ran out of certain items, forcing you to re-order. The location was moderately convenient to the London financial district and is located close to London bridge and train station, on the south bank of the Thames. Parking is ample, but costly and the area is not the best, so do not leave any luggage or valuables in your vehicle. Although new, there were a number of mechanical problems with the room: The shower stall leaked water no matter how careful you were, due to a faulty seal on the door. When I called up about it, the response was &quot;All the doors are like that&quot; and the solution was to deliver more towels to my room, presumably for me to mop up the floor with. I was there in summer and the weather was routinely quite hot, but the air conditioning in my room was not working. Over the course of 2 weeks, no one was ever dispatched to repair it, despite numerous complaints. As I was staying there for a while, I needed to send some laundry out. It returned, missing about 50% of the items (socks, underwear, etc.). Upon speaking to the front desk manager, I was told there was no way to locate it and they would have to credit my bill for the loss. The fees charged for laundry are ridiculous, and the credit only forced me to have to go and buy replacements which were much more expensive than the originals. So much for service and convenience. Lastly, and perhaps most odd, was the lack of a top-sheet on the bed. All you get was a sheet on the mattress, and a down duvet, which was much too warm given the A/C problem. How very European! When I asked for a top-sheet to be put on the bed, an apparently confused and non-English speaking maid placed a sheet over top of the duvet. Upon discovering this one night, I had to re-make the bed myself, after which it became a daily battle of wills to see how it would be made when I returned each evening. I doubt the duvets are washed after each guest, hence my wish for something else between me and it. I thought the hotel was pricey for what it was, and the service and responsiveness were completely inadequate. You may wonder why I stayed past the first night? My firm has an arrangement with the chain and we are required to stay at this location. Otherwise I would have moved immediately."
42,1000,"Sep 9 2008 	great hotel for the price!	We were initially worried about this hotel because we didn't have much information in advance. But the hotel was a great value for pricey London! The rooms were not huge, but big enough for 4, 2 adults and 2 kids, with a queen bed and a pull out double couch. They were very clean and the staff was helpful with directions to local places. We also had a tube stop (London Bridge) about 2 blocks away so getting everywhere was easy even though we weren't near some of the attractions. I would definitely recommend this hotel to people traveling with kids or in a group larger than 2 people."
43,1000,"Aug 31 2008 	Dissapointing stay in London with accor .	We originally booked the Novotel Tower Bridge for a weekend , as we have stayed there before and enjoyed it , but due to incompetent original novotel booking staff , no room was available when we got there after a long journey at 21.15pm . So we were shunted to the City South sister hotel , which was quite a long way from most attractions and tube , OK location if you enjoy the South Bank experience of art etc , but not really for families with children. Car parking was 20.00 so we parked on a nearby street for free over a weekend , Staff were helpful on arrival , but room was quite poor ,constantly flooded bathroom due to blocked drains from bath and shower , lack of pillows on the bed , and broken tv channels .Wifi / ADSL use ,was extra 5.99 per hour ! (well overpriced in these modern times ) We paid for 3 adults and one child and only received 2 cups etc , for 4 persons in the room .Sofa bed was quite basic for child and extra adult .The room was well planned out though as you can sit in the bath and watch the tv or listen to your mp 3 player with the help of a speaker in the ceiling of bathroom Breakfast buffet was good value , with a good choice of quality food , hot and cold ,which will set you up for the day ahead Cost was 275 for 2 nights , there is better value / location if you shop around over a weekend for leisure use .Doubt i would stay there again and have lost a lot of confidence in the accor group which we have usually had good experiences with in the past ."
44,1000,"Aug 18 2008 	This was a very good find	We have just returned from a 2 night stay at this Novotel and have to say we were very impressed. Got a really good deal through the hotel website. Everyone was very helpful and friendly, the room was very clean and spacious (even with our son), beds comfortable and a hearty breakfast as well! Even the walls were thick enough not to hear anything from neighbouring rooms. We will definitely be staying again. At a price, in general, not much more than a Travelodge, this place blows its main competitors out of the water - far superior in every way! 4 mins from London Bridge or 6 mins across the river to Mansion House which is a pleasant walk and v. quiet station and easy to get into the main city attractions."
45,1000,"Aug 4 2008 	Great choice for the South Bank	I have stayed at this hotel a number of times when I needed a &quot;budget&quot; location in London. It seems to be a fairly new hotel and it is certainly still very fresh and smart. The rooms are large enough and well enough equipped for an overnight stop and the parking out the back is excellent value at 12.50 for 24 hours. The hotel is within very easy walking distance of the Globe Theatre, the Tate Modern and the excellent Borough Market. This summer they are offering rooms for 89 inc. breakfast and tax - excellent value for this part of London and a very good location for business travellers or those interested in South Bank attractions. It is not particularly close to tube stations but London Bridge (the nearest) is about 10 minutes walk away. Not a luxury establishment by any means, but clean, well equipped and good value."
46,1000,"Jul 24 2008 	Decent mid-range hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights when in London for business. For that purpose it has a perfect location, close to the City. There are also a few sights in the area such as Tate Modern, London Bridge and a few others. London Bridge tube station is not that far away from the hotel (a couple of minutes I would say).The hotel is a typical Novotel-hotel. The room I had was quite large with a comfortable bed. As in most of the Novotel's hotels there is also an extra fold-out bed in the sofa. I did not sleep on it but I have heard from colleagues who have that it is rather uncomfortable.There was a bathroom with a bathtub as well as a separate shower (both in the same room). That is huge plus for me. I like to sometimes soak in the bath at night but I usually want to just have a quick shower and I prefer to shower in separate shower. The tub was also strategically positioned making it possible to watch TV from it. As other reviewers already remarked the toilet is in a separate room from the shower and bath which is fine by me. I did however not like the fact that there was no sink by the toilet.There was wifi Internet in the room and it worked rather well. The room had all the other facilities that could be expected such as TV, mini-bar, ironing board, tea and coffee. The hotel also had a small gym which I actually used. Not very big but sufficient for my needs.The restaurant at the hotel was not very good. I (unfortunately) had to have dinner there the first night. I wouldn't say that the food was bad but it was not very good either. There are tons of better choices in London and the atmosphere in the restaurant just isn't very nice. The breakfast was ok but not as good as at the other hotels I stay at in London. I would have thought that it was ok if I stayed at a 3-star hotel but for a 4-star hotel it wasn't good enough."
47,1000,"Jun 8 2008 	Location good and value for money	We booked the hotel as they offered a very good price for 3 adults in one room on their website. The hotel is behind the Financial Times building, public transport is great, the London Bridge station is 3 min walk or the Mansion house station is also 3 min walk (other side of the Thames crossing theSouthwark bridge ). We could watch even Saturday evening the Euro2008 game on the tv in the bar.The room was small (ok for us) ,clean, a double-bed and a sofabed, flatscreen TV, bathtube and shower in the bathroom and a separate WC. Iron, ironboard, hairdryer was available.I would recommend it. At the reception staff were very friendly."
48,1000,"May 27 2008 	we recommend it !	We (2 adults, one child) stayed there for a weekend in May. The child got a really big sofa bed, we got one double. Check-in was friendly, rom was clean. Breakfast was included (some English breakfast, sausages, cheese, marmelade, toast,...) Sometimes the breakfast room was to full and the waitresses couldn't do the dishes as fast as it should be.If you go by tube take London Bridge Station. You have to go 5 minutes to the hotel.In 3 minutes you will be at river Thames, in 15-20 minutes at the London eye.In total: we paid 330 GBP for 3 nights, 3 persons, incl. breakfast and recommend the hotel."
49,1000,"May 20 2008	Reasonable Accomodations	I was a little concerned about the remoteness of the hotel's location until we checked-in and discovered that it is only a 2 minute walk to the nearest Tube. Although not too many attractions are in this district, I did enjoy the feeling of being away from all the hustle &amp; bustle of tourists, etc. The area surrounding the hotel is a little gritty, but I felt safe walking around at night. There are some pubs and a tapas bar that seem to be thriving.PROS-Very close to Tube-Despite not having great food, breakfast is includedCONS-The room was incredibly small. We had a suite, and it was barely large enough to hold us and our luggage-The toilet is in a closet rather than in the bathroom-Room lacked any view, looked directly at a brick wall and window from building 20 feet away"
50,1000,Apr 22 2008 	Nice hotel in a good location	This is a nice Novotel in a good location in Southwark rd. This is close to many transport links and there is lots in the area. Rooms are nice size in traditional Novotel fitout. Rooms are suprisingly big considering the location and spotlessly clean. The staff were extremely helpful and nice. One problem is that the hotel is extremely busy during the week with business &amp; function so you may have problems getting a late booking. The area surrounding the hotel gets pretty quiet in the evening but its generally safe enough. I will return again should i need a good reliaible central hotel.
51,1000,"Mar 17 2008	Handy for the Chocolate Factory	This hotel is one of the newer Novotels. Located in Southwark, it's right across the road from the Menier Chocolate Factory (excellent fringe theatre) and very close to Tate Modern and The Globe. This is not the best-connected part of town to stay if you prefer the tube, although nearby London Bridge tube station is only a short walk away, with Northern line &amp; Jubilee line connections (so handy for events at The 02). The room was average size, with separate toilet and bathroom, desk and sofa. Tea, coffee, ironing board and basic minibar all provided. In reception there's a bar that seems to be open 24hrs.There was parking in a private car park behind the hotel (16/24hrs), accessed from Thrale St. Breakfast buffet was OK - nothing special. Next time I'd rather visit nearby Borough Market and fill up on some amazing fresh food from one of the many stalls."
52,1000,"Mar 2 2008 	Nice hotel	Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, we had a lovely quiet room at the end of a corridor, the bed was a lovely size, &amp; nice plasma screen tv. The one thing we found bizarre was that the bathroom doors opened up by the side of the bed, good sized shower and bath. However the toilet was by the entry door. It had no basin so you had to go back into the bathroom to wash your hands - not very hygenic.The breakfast was good, although the staff did not appear to be able to cope with the guests and clearing tables at the same time. There was a queue to be seated the mornings we were there. We had an evening meal and the food was excellent.This hotel was centrally located for the London Bridge Experience and the London Dungeons, it was also convenient for the river and tube station."
53,1000,"Jan 25 2008 	nice hotel  good location	Our family spent a week in this hotel.The staff is friendly and helpful, the room was big ( we had an apartment for us and our two sons ) and clean . It was our base in exploring this wonderful city  London.Nice surroundings : we liked the old bark market and other places less known for tourists ."
54,1000,"Jan 18 2008 	Definitely be back	We stayed at Novotel London City South for 3 nights and I really recommend it: great staff, excellent rooms (we booked a superior room without sofa, but they gave us one with sofa!), wide veriety of food in buffet breakfast (Continental/English). We got a promotion so the relation quality/price was very very high. Modern and clean rooms, good bed and pillow, they have a safety box, for free, and they offer you tea and biscuits.The hotel is located only 5-7 min from London Bridge Undergroung Station in a good zone, not too busy bur not too isolated, with pubs and only a few minutes of Borough Market (must visit!). The hotel is near Tate Modern, Shakespear's Globe Theatre and Southwark Cathedral.By underground and taking the Jubilee Line is only 3 stops from Westminster. If you want to go to Heathrow using the Underground take the Jubilee Line to Green Park and then the Piccadilly Line to Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3(to terminal 4, pay attention at Green Park Station, it is a different train, in the same line), the journey is about 1hour. But if you want comfort and don't mind to pay ,the hotel has a service that picks you there and let you in Heathrow (about 22 pp).And if you want to keep fit you can only go on foot through Thames Path(1 hour to Westminster) and enjoy the view, specially at night - there are many people in the street so don't be afraid, except if it is too late. We made our journey from Piccadilly Circus and we spent almost 2 hours walking, at 6 p.m.We were very satisfied with the hotel and services and definitely come back ."
55,1000,"Jan 5 2008 	Brilliant reception staff shame about the catering service	We stayed at this hotel for a short family break in London. We booked through Superbreak and got it at a good price.First impressions were good, the Reception staff were excellent, very welcoming and professional. The room was of a reasonable size for four of us, but the quality of some of the furnishings was disappointing for a four-star hotel - bobbly cushions and a nasty nylon blanket on the sofa bed for the children.The room was very hot, the fans did not make any appreciable difference other than to make a noise and in the end I resorted to opening the window - it was nice to hear the chimes from Saint Pauls but not necessarily what I wanted at 3 in the morning!Breakfast was a bit of a free for all, plates were in short supply as was patience from the staff who seemed overstretched in trying to keep up with the demand despite a long breakfast period.As we were short of time on the second day we ordered a room service meal - this was a bit of a disaster, one of the offerings barely edible.The receptionists came into their own again on our final morning as one of our children was quite ill, and they provided water and much needed polythene bags (!) for our long journey home."
56,1000,Dec 3 2007 	Very Good for the tube	Very good hotel. Lovely &amp; clean Staff great was on hand to help when needed. Had breakfast in bed which i suggest everyone does It was delivered at the time we requested. Had a meal in the hotel on the Friday night &amp; was over whelmed by the good price &amp; the amount that was on plate. Was expecting the amount that a mouse would eat but was very good value for money.5 mins walk for the tube where you can travel all over London.Would definately use this Hotel again or any other Novotels in the UK.
57,1000,Nov 28 2007 	Good location. Nice staff	I have stayed at this hotel on a number of ocassions. The rooms are nice and big and clean. The staff are helpful and friendly.Car parking is easily available for 13 (bargain in London).Its in a decent location and is walking distcance to just about everything.
58,1000,"Nov 27 2007 	The best London hotel Ive stayed at so far and the cheapest!	Hi everyone,We have visited London a few times and I have reviewed two of the hotels we have previously stayed in. As a rule our stays have been in tiny rooms but the Novotel rooms are generous. I have to agree the wash basin situated in another room to the toilet is strange but as far as there been any thing at fault with the hotel that is it. The rooms have an iron &amp; board, hair dryer, T.V, private shower &amp; bath, good heating &amp; mini bar. The mini bar has got one soft, beer, wine &amp; water in plus a few others. We did not eat in the hotel but we heard good things. The bar did close at 12pm but food was avaliable to order in your room. One thing that was a bonus about this hotel is at around 80 per night (which is cheap for London) we were quite central, its a few minutes to the tube, London/millenium bridge and there are a number of good pubs to have a night cap after a long day looking round the sites. The staff were brilliant, each and everyone of them were polite and a few of the reception staff went well out of their way to make sure we had a good stay. In all I can recommend this hotel to you and we will be back for sure.Thanks."
59,1000,"Nov 20 2007 	Incredible Value in London	I was travelling alone on the way back from meetings in Europe. I spent two days at this hotel, choosing it based on brand (Sofitel/Novotel is excellent across Europe), and location close to tourist sites and the train station. I took a cab from Waterloo Station and then had to laugh at myself since it was literally a couple of blocks away. Subsequently I walked back and forth to the tube a couple of times a day in about two minutes! Don't waste money on a cab!Conveniently located on the south shore of the Thames right by the Millenium Bridge, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, and an easy walk to the Tower and Tower Bridge. A couple of minutes to the tube station and you can anywhere in just a few short minutes. The front desk staff were very friendly and efficient, handling my check-in quickly and treating me as if I was an old friend returning to town. My room was large for London, with very modern furnishings. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens. TV worked great. Nice view from the window. Didn't eat at the hotel as there were too many great places nearby. If you stay here you absolutely must enjoy a drink or some fish and chips at &quot;The Anchor&quot; pub just a few blocks away. It's been around since the 1600's. Very cool. Also, there is a really good chicken restaurant (a little pricey) across the street from the Anchor, under an arch of the old bridge. I paid about $75 USD on Priceline. The room generally sells for a lot more, but even at rack rate this is an excellent value for London. I will absolutely stay here again when I am back in London next year!"
60,1000,"Oct 13 2007	strictly business	The staff service is very good and the rooms are kept quite clean, so the basics are well covered, but the split bathroom is a truly horrid feature (leaving one to run around the furniture to wash hands after using the toilet) and the hotel often takes a very old-fashioned attitude toward its clients - It's one of the very few hotels I've stayed in the past couple years without an extension line to hang clothes in the bathroom, which is kinda necessary given it charges 3 to wash a pair of underwear. And that's just the beginning of the gouging: 2.50 a minute to call a local mobile number (!), maybe 10 if you want to watch anything beyond the basic handful of 'free' TV channels (ie, no HBO or anything of the sort). At least there's an iron and board in the room."
61,1000,"Sep 23 2007 	Excellent all round	The Novotel London City (South) is quite a find. We needed two rooms for a night before taking the early Eurostar train and a suite at the Novotel was an absolute bargain, especially given this was London.Friendly staff, clean room, reasonable selection of food at good prices available in the bar - far better than the tourist traps along the river by the Globe Theatre.5 minutes by taxi the next morning to Waterloo, so in essence we couldn't have asked for anything more."
62,1000,Aug 3 2007 	Great Location - will stay there again	Good Location very close to london Bridge Station.The room was quite small but adequate and well presented. However a bit strange that the toilet and bathroom were seperate and you had to walk through the room to wash your hands.The bed was very comfortable.Only 5 minutes away by taxi to waterloo.
63,1000,"Jul 5 2007 	Would not Visit Again	Stayed here for 2 Nights (Friday and Saturday).A good location for the Southbank attractions ie London Eye,Tate Modern and Royal Festival Hall.The rooms were like a Sauna with an inefficient air cooling system and you needed to enjoy scrambled egg as this was the only choise of eggs at breakfast.The queue for breakfast was an unacceptable ,20 minutes on both mornings.Liked the security for the lift and Leisure room.The Bar was expensive 3.95 for a pint of CarlingTaxi to the London Palladium 17 each way,car parking for 2 nights 16Staff helpful."
64,1000,Jul 2 2007	Great Hotel	Stayed at this hotel in June for 2 nights one weekend. I couldnt fault the hotel - it was very close to 2 tube stations. The hopper bus also pulled up outside the hotel from Covent Garden every 10 minutes.Breakfasts were great - we had them in our room for both days which didnt cost any more.All in all I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone - especially if you want to go to Leicester Sq/Covent Garden.
65,1000,"Jun 24 2007	Food 	Rooms are clean, practical and average size for London.Food is very tasty and good value for money.Gym is limited and guests are asked not to use some of the machines after 9.00pm.Good location and short walk to London Bridge.I like staying here - its laid back and chilled out but I would warn folk looking for entertainment near by is very limited!"
66,1000,"May 31 2007	Budget style hotel with 4 star ammenaties	I stayed here for two nights at the end of may 2007. I believe all rooms are nearly identical. The one I had was adequate for my stay and a good size for a london hotel, I have no real complaints. However,t he bed was big but not especially comfy. The pillows fairly soft and the duvet very average. It wasn't the soft style duvet/pillow being rolled out in some other hotel chains that give you a much more confortible stay. What surprised me is that although this hotel is four star all the fixtures and fittings are budget,pre-fabricated style. Personally I think Travel Lodge and the like do a better job of this than this hotel. My biggest issue with the room was the double doors to the bathroom area being about one foot away from the side of the bed. It felt like the bed was almost pushed right up to them but there is no way to move anything around. The swing out desk though was very clever and usefull and the LCD TV good quality and positioned so you can watch if from the bath. A nice touch was the bathroom speaker so you could hear it too....To sum this up I would say if you want an adequate, clean hotel with a good sauna in a good location for central london ( although not ideal tourist location) and don't mind budget finishes then this place is great. I would say the only reason it's four star though is because of the foyer, with bar, concierge and the like."
67,1000,"May 17 2007 	This is a good hotel	Stayed for one night (a Sunday) on business. The hotel is clean, modern and the rooms are well appointed in the usual Novotel manner.The staff were very polite, efficient and welcoming although it was quiet so this may have had an impact. There is also a very acceptable bar area and the breakfast buffet was substantially above average.I've just taken on an on-going role that involves staying &quot;south of the river&quot; for occasional nights over the next year or so, and will actively seek to ensure that the company's travel team book me in here again."
68,1000,"May 11 2007 	Good stay in London	Had a one-night business trip to London with two collegues. The rooms were modern, clean and enjoyable to stay-in. The breakfast was very good. Bar area is very open plan and service was fine. I'd happily stay again.I also liked the fact that you have to swipe your room key on the lift to gain access to bedroom areas.For london this was a fairly quiet hotel."
69,1000,May 2 2007 	Good accomodation and efficient staff	A good Novotel accomodation. I've been in London with my family for a few days and I've been happy to stay here. The room was new (or newly renovated) in the essential style of all the Novotels.The staff was willing to help and very efficient.I will probably book this hotel for a future stay in London.
70,1000,"Apr 17 2007 	The Definition of a Reasonable Place	We stayed one night in this hotel , as we had a long!!!! layover in London. We wanted a reasonably priced hotel relatively near some sites we might enjoy. We got exactly that.Friendly staff greet you, although some of their advice contradicted each other. For example one told us we needed to call a taxi as not many go by , but when we went to do that another desk person said just go out and hail one, they are there all the time. He was right , at least when we need a taxi.Also, the morning desk staff was unaware that the Globe Theater was literally 2 minutes away and could not give directions. He was very friendly trying to do that though. And no matter, I found it just by walking the River , which was the best feature of this hotel. It is very close to a very pleasant Riverbank walk, very near the Tate Modern and a bridge away from St Paul's. I enjoyed my morning stroll!!The room was Ikea Modern. Pleasant to look at, pretty comfortable. I requested nonsmoking, and the room itself certainly was. I am not sure the whole floor was non smoking though, or someone was breaking the rules! I smelled smoke in hallways. However, I am very sensitive to smoke, and the lobby and bar on the first floor were smoking and I may have been reacting to going through them. The toilet was seperate from the shower and sink. I like a sink in a little closer proximity to the toilet, but ...the shower was great!It was hot in the room and the air conditioning did not seem to do anything, so I slept with windows open, which was a little noisy, but much nicer than a hot room.Internet access in lobby was coin driven, and seemed reasonable to me. We ate in a couple cafes on the above mentioned Riverbank walk.I enjoyed this hotel and its location and value."
71,1000,"Mar 17 2007 	Plush hotel shame about the air con	I booked this hotel through my company travel agent as I was working just across the road from where the hotel is located. Initial impressions were good. The staff are very friendly and do whatever they can to help. The main reception was welcoming.I was given a room on the 5th floor which was superb in every respect bar one...even in March when temperatures are not that high, the room was too warm and the air con wasn't much use - in the summer this would be unbearable, as opening the window proved noisy. I think that if they did something with the air conditioning, this hotel would rate as one of the best in London, for the money paid anyway. The room itself is well decorated and ultra modern with nice tv and some useful technology. It's a pity some hotel chains don't follow the lead of Radisson and offer free wi-fi in all rooms. The again you can't have everything.Overall, an excellent hotel which is very well maintained. Just a shame about the rooms being greenhouse like in heat terms."
72,1000,"Mar 11 2007 	Convenient location and very functional	I was very lucky to be able to book this hotel at last minute. It was conveniently located and great connection from Gatwick ariport. There are several great restaurants within a few minutes walk, and convenient to the subway station. The room was very functional and clean. Although it was located in the city, the room was very quiet and I was able to get good night sleep. I will certainly use this hotel again."
73,1000,"Feb 20 2007	Excellent hotel	Just stayed in the hotel for one night. Stayed due to it's closeness to the Oxo Tower restaurant and it was a lovely riverside walk to the restaurantTotally recommend the hotel for any length of stay. The rooms are exactly as picture. Stylish bathroom with shower cubicle and bath tub with hidden taps so you can both bathe!! Seperate toilet which is a lovely touch. Nice flat screen telly and all the mod cons, internet access, plug for MP3 player so you listen through telly. Bed lovely and huge, duvet instead of blankets which again is lovely touchOnly complaint was it was too hot and air con didn't do much good, otherwise fantastic"
74,1000,"Feb 6 2007	Great Staff - good size rooms	We stayed 4nights in Dec.The staff at this hotel are amazing especially reception who went out of their way to answer &amp; assist us with every question we had for them. From helping us with tours, to writing directions, to organising cabs the list goes on. Good size room with a beautiful shower. We had one or two complaints one was the fridge as it was warm we did complain about it but were advised this is normal in London (but other hotels in the UK that we visited proved this is not so as all other fridges were lovely &amp; cold) &amp; two no clock which appears to be the norm for UK/Europe. Only a 5min walk to London Bridge tube a couple of small comvenience stores same distance &amp; a couple of pubs .Fair step to most of the attractions especially in the cold of winter. Take the tube. On our way back into London after visiting Scotland we stayed in the Kensington/Earls Court &amp; would have to say that this is a far better area than Southwark in terms of eateries, shops etc. Although the Market near the hotel I think Borough is the name was excellent &amp; you could find all the food you wished there but it did close early. Breakfast was included in our rate &amp; was an excellent way to start the day. The bar/bistro was also a great place to relax after a days outing &amp; the meals were of a good standard. The one thing we had a chuckle over was there among the rates for the rooms was a rate for your dog again this appears to be normal for London as saw one on a bus &amp; not a seeing eye dog either."
75,1000,"Jan 18 2007	Clean comfortable and neat location	I choose this hotel because this was my first trip to London and I wasn't sure how easy it would be to get around London. I wanted a location that was in walking distance of some of London's attractions. This hotel did not disappoint. St. Paul's Cathedral is about 10 minutes walk, the Tower Bridge is about 15 minutes walk, and the Tower of London is right next to the Tower Bridge...so about 20 minutes. Additionally, the nearest tube station (London Bridge Station) is about 5 minutes walk.The hotel itself was very clean. The rooms were comfortable and had a very modern style to them. I wouldn't call the rooms small....just not as big as what I would expect in the US.Overall a good hotel and I'd have no problems reccommending it."
76,1000,"Jan 11 2007 	nice clean room	We just had one night in London, and we stayed here because we needed somewhere to park the car. Parking was right out the back. It was our first time to London and we found that it was quite far from all the touristy sites.. but it was a nice walk over the Southwark Bridge (pronouced sa-vark) being Aussie its was strange but made as laugh everytime we walked over it..The room (standard room) was a little small but pleasant, we were next to the gym unfortunately and when we first arrived all we could hear was buzzing and thumping through the wall of the gym.The bed was huge, u could fit at least 5 people side by side in it. Bathroom is new and clean and the shower pressure is perfect.We liked the hotel, staff are friendly but next time we might try something over the Thames.."
77,1000,"Dec 30 2006	Location	Stayed in this hotel for a weekend in London and was pleasantly surprised by the quality for what we had paid. The room was admittantly small (as is normal in London) but it was clean with bright decorations. The bathroom had both a bath and walk in shower - the only odd thing is the toilet being in a seperate room as everybody else mentions. But definitely didn't ruin our stay, can surely put up with that for a few days! The reception was big and bright and hotel staff appeared friendly enough although we didn't ask for much help. The hotel is in a convenient location you can walk into picadillys, oxford street etc but at night got a taxi as too cold which only cost a few quid, cant really grumble. Overall, would definitely stay here again, this hotel is a nice place to stay for exploring all that London has to offer- what a great city!!!"
78,1000,"Dec 20 2006 	Nice Hotel!	Stayed here with my husband on a weekend break to London. We got a good rate (i think we paid 130 p/n) which we thought was very good value for London and were very pleased with the Hotel.The Rooms were modern, clean and spacious. We had a double queen sized bed and sofa in the main living area and the bathroom was very modern and clean with separate shower and bath.The hotel is located near to Waterloo tube station and was also a 3-5 minute walk to the Thames which is lined with Bars and Restaurants. At night it was a lovely stroll back to the Hotel along the river as the city was lit up. The Hotel is also in walking distance of St Pauls Cathedral and the Tate Gallery. London is such a vast city that nowhere is really central and you can guarantee that at some stage of your trip you will need to use the tube/other transport to see the whole city. We found this hotel to be a good base and were impressed with it. We go to London regulaly for short breaks and would return to this hotel again."
79,1000,"Oct 17 2006 	Second stay and again very good experience	This was my second stay in the Novotel Southwark, again everything was fine, rooms were clean and spacious, staff is dedicated to their customers, the City is in walking distance and the infrastructure is fine, I find this hotel good for pleasure and business and it is not spoiled like many tourist hotel in London."
80,1000,"Oct 15 2006 	Great Hotel !!! Recommended	My boyfriend and I only stayed at this hotel for 1 night, and we didn't even arrive until 9.30 pm !!! Staff were very friendly, room was perfect, only a 'standard' room but one of the best 'standard rooms' I've ever seen! Then after a quick shower and quick bite to eat in bar (coupled with a couple of bears!) - they were still serving food at 10.30 !!! - we then went out and came back at 3.30am and all was fine, the guy on reception was friendly. One of the other best things about this hotel is the late check out time, we were obviously knackered after staying out late, so woke up late, had late breakfast and left hotel at mid-day ! Would definately recommend it. !"
81,1000,"Oct 6 2006 	Great service from the duty manager	Great hotel, well situated near the South Bank and convenient for the Globe Theatre, Tate Modern, Clink Prison Museum, London Dungeon, Boat Trips, the South Bank Centre etc. Very clean and well maintained. Good breakfast (great sausages!)."
82,1000,"Aug 15 2006 	Novotel South Bank is great	Excellent hotel/location. Our family with 2 teens stayed in one spotless room 4 nights in August and were quite happy. First, it's around the corner from the 250-year-old open Borough market that's perhaps Europe's finest organic market. (Fri-Sat). Great. To boot, Monmouth Coffee there serves espressos for 80p - unheard of! Second, it's a short walk to The Globe Theatre, the Tate Modern, and other cool river-side haunts. This made it a quick walk home at 3am after a midnight performance! Third, a short walk to London Bridge station (very good connections), and only 1/2 hour walk to many other spots (e.g., covent gardens, british museum, etc.). South bank is london's up and coming cultural area, so it's a great play unless you want to walk through a park early in the a.m. or stay near Queen Elizabeth's tomb. The hotel itself is spotless and has 'just so' features - everything works/fits - after all, it's Swiss, though you wouldn't know it is (or that you're in britain) from the friendly front desk folks. Net access is pricy in room, but cheap per minute in lobby. breakfast is outrageously expensive there, but lots of street options near london bridge."
83,1000,"Jun 16 2006	Great Hotel - Great Location	We recently spent three days at this great hotel. We were a party of four adults and two young children (aged one and three).Consisting of grandparents from England and family with young children from the USA. Everything we had asked for was provided including adjoining rooms, baby cot, high chair etc. We had a three night week-end break and considered this good value ( breakfast was included in the price of 99.00 per room per night and the children ate free - there was plenty of choice catering for all tastes. It is in a great location - just minutes from the River Thames - a short boat trip from the Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Also near an excellent market with interesting produce, museums and other riverside attractions. Hotel was very clean and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. The small children's play area with lego etc. is great to keep the children amused whilst the adults finish their breakfast. We were able to pre-book our tickets for the Tower of London at the Hotel - a bonus as it saved time when we arrived at The Tower.The area is safe and the security in the hotel is excellent. To sum up I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and would certainly stay here again on a future visit to London."
84,1000,"Apr 23 2006	Good rooms skip the restaurant	One night stay in a triple room (queen bed plus sleeper sofa) for 109 GBP including breakfast. Room was quiet and clean and beds were comfortable. By London standards, not a bad price. City of London and south bank attractions are within easy walking distance. Nearest Underground station (Southwark) is 5-7 minute walk, and Waterloo Station was a 5 GBP cab ride distant. Were exhausted after an afternoon of exploring and tried dinner at the hotel restaurant. We should have heeded the warning sign of only a few people eating there. Food was overcooked, the steak was tasteless and everything was way overpriced (about $110 for a shoe leather steak, an overcooked seafood platter, a kids cheesburger plate and a bottle of wine). Service was okay, but for less money, you could have done better at any number of restaurants just around the south corner of the hotel. Hotel breakfast was okay, so consider staying there, but don't bother with lunch or dinner."
85,1000,"Apr 18 2006 	Good quality business hotel	I stayed in the Novotel City South 2 times in December whilst working weekends in London.It is basically a very nice, well run hotel, which caters for business travellers very well. I found that the hotel was well run, everything was really efficient and the food was pretty good for a hotel chain. Definitely worth a stay especially if you are a business traveller. If you want lots of character try elsewhere."
86,1000,Mar 21 2006	Standard Chain Hotel	Nice hotel although nothing spectacular. Much the same as any other large chain hotel.
87,1000,"Mar 6 2006	great hotel	Have just come back from a weekend break at this hotel. More expensive than our usual accomodation, but well worth it. Staff very helpful and friendly, rooms excellent( perhaps a little stingy with the towels), breakfast really did set you up for the day. Within easy walking distance of major attractions (London Eye, Tower Bridge, Tate Modern). Would definitely stay there again."
88,1000,"Feb 27 2006	A good location in central London and great value for money	This was the second time that we'd stayed in the area, last time we stayed at the equally good Southwark Rose hotel next door, however the Novotel B&amp;B weekend package of 89 a night was better value.Good location, very close to London Bridge or Southwark tube station.We were welcomed to the hotel by friendly reception staff and check-in was very quick. Our room was on the 6th floor which was nice and quiet and was a good size with a comfy bed. The bathroom was of better quality than some that I've seen in significantly more expensive hotels, with a fantastic walk-in power-shower, a good deep bath with an additional hand-held shower, a large sink and a full-length mirror. All very nice. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the toilet is separate from the main bathroom and does not include a sink which is a little strange but nothing major.The breakfast was good, not the best I've had in a hotel, but definitely not the worst and was great value as included in the rate. Hot buffet: Sausages, bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes, and baked beans. Cold buffet: toast, rolls, mini pastries (about 4 varieties), yoghurt, cereals, fruit, cheese, and 3 kinds of fruit juices. There was always plenty of each item left, despite breakfast being served until 11.30am. The hotel bar is really nice, though quiet most of the time and there is an internet cafe and games console in the foyer although I'm not sure how much these cost.Check-out is a leisurely 12pm and on Sundays you can check-out at 5pm for no additional cost. All in all, a very pleasant stay. Would definitely stay here again, especially at the current internet rates."
89,1000,"Feb 22 2006	Really great hotel	What you see on pictures is what you get. A bright room with a very comfortable bed. The breakfast is amazing : fresh fruits, fresh fruit juices, pastries, eggs, beans, sausages,...The staff is very friendly: they gave me a room before the official checking and an adaptator plug (I forgot mine).The area is very calm. The hotel is close to the tate modern, to restaurants (wagamama, nando, the anchor..) along the thames, to the borough market.Five minutes walking to the london brigde station (choose the high borough street/southwark exit)"
90,1000,"Feb 10 2006	ok novetel	Stayed here in jan , rooms were ok but a bit on the small size .we asked for a family room as our daughter was staying with us,and their was just enought room to pull out the sofa.good location though.The hotel is a four star and gave a exellent rate.Would stay here again but not with family in the same room.Have stayed in better in london and a hell of a lot worse!"
91,1000,"Feb 9 2006	Great Hotel	Just had a two night break at this hotel. Very comfortable room that was bright and very clean. Very well designed bathroom and great shower. As mentioned in other reviews the bed was really comfortable. Always a bonus! Tea/coffee biscuits, iron and ironing board all very well incorporated in the well designed room.Our deal included a cooked breakfast. All the usual things. A big choice of cereals, fruit pastries etc. Kept us going all day!Very friendly staff. A real gem of a place tucked beside Southwark Bridge.If you arrive via London Bridge Station you would be best (if walking) to exit via the underground entrance."
92,1000,"Jan 24 2006	Excellent Hotel	Despite glowing reviews on here, we were still pleasantly surprised. I can't praise the hotel highly enough. The rooms were of a reasonable size, bright, airy, functional and very clean. The staff couldn't have been more attentive and friendly and would not have been out of place in any 5 star hotel. Breakfast was a pleasant relaxed affair with Continental or Full English on offer. The beds were superb and the hotel was situated in a very quiet area, so a great night's sleep was guaranteed. My compliments to Novotel, we will definitely be back."
93,1000,"Sep 20 2005 	A really nice hotel	I've just had 2 weeks at the Novotel London City South, and I can recommend it whole-heartedly.I found the staff to be very friendly and polite, the rooms were modern, clean, well designed and spacious. The bathroom was particularly nice, with some quite expensive looking touches, and the shower was nice and powerful. The bed was very large and very comfortable. The room temperature was fine, and was very quiet. Facilities in the room were everything I would expect, and the iron/ironing board was particularly handy. In my first week's stay I even had a view of the city from the 5th floor, which was nice.I ordered a continental breakfast in my room each day, by leaving a note on my door the night before. This arrived on time each morning, and was of a good standard. The only (very) minor gripe I have, is that the newspaper which I had ordered didnt arrive the first two mornings of my second week - but as they gave me a (different) paper with my breakfast, that didnt really matter.The best thing of all about this hotel was the location. Surely the South Bank is the most pleasant part of London, with the picturesque riverside walk being a real joy. St Pauls Cathedral, the London Eye, the wobbly bridge are all within easy walking distance, but best of all, only 2 minutes away is Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Anyone who has the time to spare MUST see a play there, paying 5 to stand in the yard - it's fantastic!"
94,1000,"Aug 15 2005	Very Nice Family Friendly Hotel	Used this website to pick a hotel for the end of a recent family vacation in the United Kingdom. It was a great finish to our vacation. Booked the hotel over the phone with the hotel directly ... got a very good rate for the weekend which included tax and breakfast. A bit more expensive for the 1 weekday of our stay (we were there for 4 nights).Breakfast was very good ... full english plus many other options. Kids are free.Room was small, but did not feel too small. Split of toilet and the shower/bath was a good idea, especially for a family. Provided 1 queen bed and 1 pull-out sofa bed, which was fine for our family (2 adults, 2 children under 5). Room had A/C, but was not really needed when we were in London. Overall a good room layout.Staff was very friendly and helpful. No problems. Minor problem with the information provided on a taxi to Gatwick when we left ... rate was not fixed as I was led to believe, but negogiated a fixed rate with the driver no problem before we left.Location was ok ... safe and close to London Bridge subway station. Also a few minutes from the Thames riverside walk. Also close to the George Pub, which is a nice National Trust property."

1,1008,Jan 2 2009 	very enjoyable stay	after reading the last review on TA of this hotel
2,1008,Jul 5 2007 	Please avoid it at all cost!	We took our two young boys and our grown niece to London during mid June 2007 and stayed at the 13 Half Moon Street Apartments in London Mayfair for 10 nights. This is a three bedroom serviced apartment that is affiliated with the Flemings Mayfair Hotel right next door. We were in the Sanford suite
3,1008,Jun 10 2004	A Wonderful Hotel	Ah
1,1010,Nov 21 2009 	Excellent hotel; modern and clean. Very friendly staff.	I planned a last minute city break to London with my sister. I booked this hotel less than 2 weeks prior to our trip. It cost 120 per night for the room which was excellent value given the standard of the hotel and the location. It was much better in reality and the photographs I had looked at previously didn't really do it justice. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready so we left our bags. Emeric was on the door and he was most friendly. He was on the door for the duration of our stay and on every occasion went out of his way to welcome us back or to provide us with directions when we were leaving. Our room was lovely. It was very modern and clean. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel deciding to do a bit of shopping first before stopping for breakfast so I cannot comment on the restaurant facilities. Location was perfect. It was about a 3 minute walk from Baker Street Tube Station and within walking distance of Oxford Street. However the street were the actual hotel was located was quiet and very pleasant.I would definitely recommend this hotel and would have no hestiation in going back there again.
2,1010,"Nov 20 2009 	Lovely Hotel - Highly Recommended!	Found Ten Manchester Street via a good deal on lastminute and stayed one night on business. As it's a newly opened hotel they probably don't have full bookings yet hence the good deals still available. I imagine that when the occupancy increases so will the charges...and quite significantly!Ten Manchester Street is best described as a small, exclusive boutique hotel and it's been finished to a very high standard. Excellent and friendly staff who really can't do enough for you...it's like being in your own private Gentlemens club! 5 minute walk to Oxford Street so also an ideal location for a shopping weekend. Nearest Tube station is Baker Street, again about 5 minutes away. Hotel is set in a quiet residential area away from all the hustle and bustle.We didn't eat in the hotel but the dining area and menu looked excellent! Lovely outdoor cigar terrace for a nice relax at the end of the day! Only compliants were the lift, it takes forever and the free wi-fi not being password protected. They probably have half of West London all using their connection which caused it to be so SLOW!Highly recommend Ten Manchester Street and will look to stay again next time I'm in London!"
3,1010,"Nov 19 2009 	A Fantastic Classic London Experience	The staff really made this fabulous hotel. The manager Suzie was a model of grace and charm. They are lucky to have her. No ten is brand new and they are still ironing out a few creases. The bed was the most cozy and comfortable I have ever slept in. They are using these amazing mattress toppers. The location was fantastic, great shops, restaurants, London at your feet. Try Hardy's traditional English resturant near by, it has the best traditional English food I have ever tasted. The Lebanese restaurant close by has won lots of awards and the food is delicious also. Our suite at no 10 was large and luxurious. I can highly recommend it."
4,1010,Nov 10 2009 	Just opened few teething problems but suspect it will be great	Stayed here the first week it was open. The room was lovely if a little compact but hot unusual for London. As everything was brand new it was spotlessly clean. Nice bathroom with good ameneties. Price was very good for room quality. Few teething problems with TV not being tuned / aeriel connected and a pillow case missing. But once this is sorted I think it will be great.Best bit is outdoor heated area for drinks.
5,1010,Nov 6 2009 	Lovely hotel great location very welcoming!	Stayed for a birthday weekend treat and were kindly upgraded to a suite! Brilliant room - all newly furnished. Quiet location and excellent service. Manager (Suzi) very welcoming. Like other commentators we agree that it does feel like a private club. Didn't try breakfast but will do so on our next visit - which is in fact in a couple of weekends time. Intend to use this as our regular place as we were so impressed! We have stayed in a lot of London hotels so that says a lot!
6,1010,"Nov 4 2009 	We want to come back	What a beautiful hotel. From the moment you walk up the inviting stairway to the glorious foyer and smiling staff; you feel welcome.The room was sexy, yet warm and very chic! Great design.Food was great, I want the recipe for both dishes we enjoyed.Stroll to central London shopping, heaven! Definitely looking forward to returning soon. Thank you!!!"
7,1010,"Nov 3 2009 	stay away its all mine!!!	We decided to make a shopping trip to London and were looking for somewhere very close to Oxford Street and stumbled on this absolute gem.5 mins from Selfridges but a million miles away from all the hustle and bustle.Recently refurbished, this beautiful hotel has all advantages of a modern hotel but made us feel like a member of the family. Large Plasma TV's, (we had an upgrade and the room had 2!) large shower heads, beds to die for. The staff were happy, smiling and always on hand to help.I didn't want to leave, but the nespresso machine in the room meant I had to go for a walk. We will be back!"
8,1010,"Oct 30 2009 	Great new hotel	I stayed at Ten as my usual local favourite was fully booked. This was a real find in a peaceful location, and had only just opened a few weeks ago. Rooms were extremely well furnished with aircon and bathrooms were fabulous with huge walk in showers. It really felt more like staying in a private club than a hotel, particularly with the cigar terrace to the rear and very intimate bar / restaurant. Food was good although service could have been a little slicker - am sure this will come with practice!! All staff were extremely friendly and willing to please. I will certainly be back. Many thanks."
9,1010,"Oct 24 2009 	Excellent Hidden Gem in London - recently re-opened	I decided to try this hotel after learning of its recent reopening after refurbishment. Not only is it perfectly located in Marylebone it has been done to an exceptional standard and fantastic value for money. The rooms were exceptionally well presented and one of the most comfortable nights sleep I have had in a while. I didn't need have dinner as I was dining locally, however I bought my guests back for a night cap on the cigar terrace they have created, which is a very comfortable warm space, where we enjoyed 5 star service and one of my party tried a Cohiba Robustos cigar from their well stocked humidor.I am delighted to have found a new home in London and would recommend to anyone visiting on business or pleasure."
1,1018,"Nov 20 2009 	Disgusting!	Filthy place, apparently now being used by London Council to house asylum seekers. I turned up with work colleague with the rooms pre paid by our company. Receptionist (in cupboard) insistant that rooms had not been paid for insisted on credit card for further payment! Left very swiftly and found alternative accomodation at Holiday Inn Regents park for a cheaper rate and a room where you felt safe to close your eyes. Definately a place to avoid."
2,1018,"Oct 5 2009 	TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!	I don't normally complain, but please don't go near this hotel. The customer service from this place is the worse I have ever encountered. I booked a room and then hours before my stay they cancelled on me on a very busy weekend, so finding another hotel at such short notice was difficult. But the worst was to come. Days later after looking at my bank statement I noticed that they had still charged me! An honest mistake I thought... But when I phoned them the rude staff (especially the manager) told me I was charged because I did not show, even thought they had cancelled on me! They refused to give me my money back. They told me I would have to speak to the booking agency or the go between Hotel Solutions. They refused to discuss the matter even when I explained that it was their mistake. In all my years (39) I have never experienced such poor customer service. Fortunately, after 2 months of haggling and endless phone calls and a word with Trading Standards Hotel Solutions kindly gave me my money back even though it wasn't there place to do so. The Opulence Hotel refused to acknowledge their mistake or refund me. It's not what the Opulence Hotel did to me but it's the way they did it that is so disgraceful! They were rude and arrogant. I've never heard anything positive about this place. It's a complete fiasco. If you've booked and still have time to change do so now, or you WILL REGRET IT!"
3,1018,"Sep 10 2009 	dreadful dreary disorganised and dangerous	The booking for 7 rooms was made by our secretary through Laterooms. Having looked at the Opulence Hotel website, she told us to expect a four star hotel at a bargain price. How wrong!We arrived at a pokey, tatty little hotel on a busy main road.Reception was at a cubby hole on the first landing. There was no formal check in. The receptionist gave us keys but did not take our names or personal details. Although it was 4pm my room was not ready. I asked if there was somewhere to wait. The receptionist walked to a locked door which she opened. In the room I heard her argue with a colleague. He was very angry and shouted that she had made a mess of things and to sort it out herself. By this time I felt distinctly uncomfortable. She ushered me into the room to sit with her colleague while my room was cleaned.Eventually I went to my bedroom which was in the basement. It was dark, very hot and had no facilities for hot or cold drinks.The main problem occurred when the remaining 3 people in our group arrived to check in at 6pm. Despite one of them having dropped off his bags earlier in the day, he was told his room had been given to someone else and the hotel was now full. The last 2 people of the group were told their booking had been cancelled!All three of them had to leave and find alternative accommodation.The next morning, to add insult to injury, we were told on check out that two of the rooms we had booked had not been used and we would have to pay 200 for the &quot;no shows&quot;!The hotel is very badly run. There was no apology and were told in no uncertain terms that it was all our fault!Don't stay here!!!!!!!!!"
4,1018,Jul 21 2009 	Excellent Hotel Great Service and Splendid Rooms	I booked two rooms for a one week stay and of us really enjoyed it. Rooms are spacoius with rich decoartion .Nice bathrooms with bathrobes . Breakfeast Buffet was fine with the Chef inviting us for fresh omlettes.We were able to order room service at very reasonable prices. My children were accessing broadband internet all day long we had ample choices of TV channels . This has been one of my best hotel experiences in London.
5,1018,"Jul 12 2009 	never ever be tempted to stay here	The hotel was booked last minute and the picture looked ok - oh how deceptive that picture was! The reception is a shack, in effect stuffed into a corner, it was a shambles. The carpets are filthy and stained and were not fitted - as a consequence the edges were all tattered. The trip to the room (god help you if you are at the top as we were) was via a staircase which was poorly maintained (wall-paper peeling off, water stains down the wall). The room was terrible. The carpet was again stained and poorly fitted. the bedding was a disgrace and I threw the top cover into the wardrobe, where it stayed. The net curtain was grey with filth. The shower leaked all over the floor and was crammed into a space that my husband could not turn round in. You could not get to the sink properly because it was so crammed. The television did have 25 channels, however 24 of them did not have a reception. If there is a fire and you are the top, make sure that you have made a will because you will never get out unless you use the net curtains to paracute out! The receptionist was there from dawn to dusk but we did our best not to wake him when we came back at 10am to find him snoring laying on top of his reception shack. I would not rely on him for security or any form of fire warning system. The best way to navigate the room is to back into the shower and then jump onto the bed to dry off - thereby avoiding the carpet! To top it off two pillows with no pillow cases. We were flabergastered at the place, however my heart went out to the two Americans behind me who had paid 231 to stay there !"
6,1018,"Jul 6 2009 	I would never advise to stay here	How I wish I'd seen these reviews before booking my stay. My weekend was ruined because of this hotel. I tried to call about 10 times to get directions, but nobody answered the phone. We eventually found it at around 16:00, and when we got there, there was nobody to let us into the room as he &quot;had gone to the post office&quot;. We were shown into a grotty little downstairs kitched to wait, and then when he showed up, we were told he needed to get the room ready.....when it should have been ready for us to get into at 12:00. We waited a while longer and then were let into our room which looked run-down....and the noise from the road outside was awful. Having had enough, I advised that we weren't staying, whihc resulted in an argument about payment for the room. This was supposed to be a special weekend to celebrate my girlfrieds birthday, and they completely ruined it."
7,1018,"Jun 13 2009 	Friendly start but poor stay	Stayed here with colleagues and had to cut my stay short after one night. Whilst check in was very friendly with the concierge taking our bags to our rooms, the room I was given was at the top of 3 very steep flights of stairs and very small with a tiny bathroom. I wanted to open the window to let some air in but the very thick net in front of it looked dirty. The TV had poor reception and when I woke up during the night my room was filled with the smell of cigarette smoke - no idea where this was coming from as the hotel was non smoking. When I told the receptionist in the morning of the issues I had experienced he was not particularly helpful and made no apology."
8,1018,"Jun 8 2009 	The worst hotel experience ever	At first i want to point out the only thing i liked, the staff was ok. Now to my negative experiences.At first we arrived at the hotel att 2 a.m and we had to clime a lot of narrow stairs with our luggage. When we arrived at the room the minibar was not functioning. So we had to run down the stairs to ask the guy in the reception if they had anything to drink in the hotel. They hadnt. He was about to lock up the hotel so we couldnt go outside. Although it said in our reservation that the hotel reception was supposed to be open 24h. But we were to thirsty to go to bed after a long travel so we had to knock on the room that he slept in and he just said that we could put something under the door so it didnt lock itself. We also had a problem with the reception when we were going to check out and we found the reception unattendent. We almost missed our flight becuase we had to rung around the hotel looking for any staff, But we never found anybody so i had to write a note. Now to the rooms. It was absolutely disgusting! The first thing we saw was the the bed had a lot of stains on it. The curtain had a sticky big white stain allover the bottom. I found broken glass in the drawers. The floor had dark stains. But now to the worst i found a pair of mens underwear with faeces all over it beside the wardrobe. It was aboslutely horrible! I would also like to point out that it said in our booking that there was supposed to be a lot of channels on the TV but i was like 6 channels and only 3 of them were in english. No movies channels. It was also supposed to have movies you could watch but surprise, they didnt work. You can guess what my overall experience was."
9,1018,"Jun 2 2009 	fantastic helpful staff	We were moved here the day before our stay as the original hotel was overbooked. We found the staff very helpful, they had been informed that we had booked a twin room and although they had none available at the time they set a room up for us and when they realised we prefered a double they moved us on the second night. The staff organised the move including all the luggage, including the stuff my partner had put in the fridge.The breakfast was superb, we would visit again but unfortunately are unable to ge the same deal so we have had to look elsewhere"
10,1018,"May 30 2009 	Nice place to stay	Ok, where to startthe hotel is located in very good area, 5 mis from Oxford Street, very good for tourist. A small hotel, nice and clean. I have booked a Double room for 140 a night, and when I have arrived, the gentleman at the reception was very nice and gentle. He helped me with bags and offered me Suite with no charge, because the room booked for was on third floor, so didn't want me to wake up with my heavy luggage. I had room, very nice decorated and clean. I have really enjoyed my stay, and i would recommed to my best friend to stay in Opulence hotel."
11,1018,"Apr 27 2009 	Telephone beforehand	I booked a night at this hotel through Hotel club. I received my confirmation e mail.Planning to attend a university reunion in London this was ideally situated. I arrived at the hotel where the gentleman at the front desk said he knew nothing about my booking and sorry he was full. Another guest was getting the same story. He looked in his computer and said there was somewhere round the corner for 400 for the night but that was the limit of his customer service. I had to try and find a late room at 5pm on a Saturday night in London, not an easy or cheap thing to do! I then e mailed Hotelclub the following day who said they had tried to contact me (No evidence of e mail or phone call ) and they had also left a message at the hotel to go to another hotel (Again no message according to the only gentleman on the front desk).All in all very bad customer service and leaves a very bad taste . so my only advice ring beforehand to confirm otherwise you might have a very expensive shock."
12,1018,"Aug 6 2008 	Crazy manager filthy rooms horrible breakfast	The hotel is horrible, do not believe the pictures dispalyed on their web-site. So, where do I start. First of all, I was woken up in the middle of the night becase the ceiling was leaking right above my bed. And not just some drops, no but like a proper rain. I went to complain to reception and there was nobody there. It turns out that they have no staff at night, and mind you, this is a hotel advertised as 4 star, and I was paying a lot of money for the room I had, some 350 prpn. In the morning I went to the manager about the problem, and you won't believe it, but he said that he had a headache, and he cannot do anything about it, and plus he had had enough of this country, (he is a foregner, apparently egyptian), where everybody is crazy and out of their minds. I couldn't believe this, I wanted to leave the hotel but I couldn't find anything else at the time, everything was full, so had to stay there.Second, the restaurant is filthy. Again, It took me a while to find somebody to serve me my breakfast, so had to pop into their kitchen to see if there was any staff. My God, the kitchen is the worst I have ever seen, the filthiest, the dirtiest, with garbage on the floor, dirty utensils, and th floor looked like it has never been swept or mopped since the opening. Needless to say that i was off my breakfast, but i decided to stay for a cup of coffee. There is a buffet, but I would never eat anything from it even if I was dying from famine, cheese and salami looked mouldy and well past the use-by date, so was the bread. If the sight of the kitchen, restaurant and food hadn't put me off my breakfast already, then it would definitely be the blonde girl who was serving the breakfast who would finish off the whole disgusting image. She was rude, loud, and had dirt under her nails, and in general didn't look very hygienic. She was talking loudly on her mobile, and you could hear her from evey corner of the hotel. She approached me with over-familiarity, bordering on obsenity as if I was her drinking buddy. I decided against having coffee there as well. The only exception was a receptionist, Venera, a ray of light in the whole hotel, who made everyhting possible to make our stay bearable, always with a smile on her face, and full of knowledge on London, she went out of her way to help us with everything. But sadly, the next day when I came to check out I was told she resigned. And I'm not surprised she did. I will never come back to this hotel, i would not recommend anybody to do that."
13,1018,"Mar 13 2008 	Noisy expensive and run down	Very poor. Our room was over the main road outside and very noisy.Upstairs showers leaked into our air conditioning system.We though expensive for a tiny room and no gym and no free Wifi.Yes it is opulent, but its fading and past it's sell by date.Don't bother"
14,1018,"Mar 12 2008 	Fabulous Hotel!	We've stayed at this lovely hotel in February this year. The hotel is new, it opened only last year, I was told by staff. We had a very nice stay, the staff was very freindly and nice, and made us feel at home. The furnishings and decorations are luxurious and rich, when you walk into the hotel you feel like you are in some art gallery, and not a hotel. It's a quite a small hotel, but very pleasant. The beds were wonderful, and so were the bedding, the pillows so comfortable that you fall asleep as soon as your head hits it. Another great thing about the hotel is it's location. It's very close to Oxford street, if you like shopping, and quite close to the West End too. I would recommend to have dinner at the hotel. We had our dinner there every night, and very pleasantly surprised, as the food was far tastier than some restaurants. I will definitely come back and stay at Opulence when I'm in London again."
15,1018,"Oct 20 2007 	Nice room but very noisy	The rooms were very nicely done with lots of fabrics and artwork. Sadly, my son had to walk downstairs to the owners unit at 2 a.m. because the television was so loud we could not sleep. The hotel also lacks a lift.... or a bellman. Carrying my own suitcases up 5 flights of stairs in a $500.00 a night hotel seemed a bit much!"
1,1022,Mar 18 2008	Stinky - Oxford House	Filthy net curtains - filfthy carpets.Gross - Smelly toilets.Got sent to another building - climbed up flights of stairs - got to room only to find telly wouldnt work without remote. There was a note on the wall saying if I wanted to use telly I had to get a remote from reception. Why couldnt they give me one when I booked in????The only good thing about the place was the location!
2,1022,"Oct 28 2007 	Good value	Stayed here over two years ago. I believe I paid 35 pounds a night for my double bed. Other than the manky headboard (seen in the photos), I found this place very clean and comfortable. Great value if you're just looking for a place to sleep and clean up while you spend your days out and about the city. Had to use the loo and shower either up or down half a stairway, but that's OK with me. Good breakfast too."
3,1022,"May 8 2005	Oxford House Hotel - good value	My husband I spent 11 nights at the Oxford House Hotel, 92 Cambridge St, Westminster/Victoria (London) in April/May, 2005. We found the hotel entirely adequate for our needs and within our budget at 45/night for our double that included a substantial breakfast. Shower and toilets are either up or down a half-flight of stairs and are shared by 3 or 4 other rooms; we rarely waited for a shower, especially if we were up early. The hotel is well located in a very nice neighborhood full of similar hotels, within easy walking distance of Victoria Station, an excellent supermarket and bus line #24 which serves the central part of London. The hotel was acceptably clean though paint is needed on window sashes; places such as corners of the showers, under and behind faucets and the like could use some attention (Im a corner cleaner!). Towels (no face cloths provided) were exchanged every third day. I found the heavy, flowery room odorizer a bit much but the smell didnt pervade our room much, especially since we were able to leave the window open. Our room, on the street side, was very quiet; airplanes from Heathrow early in the morning were only a slight annoyance. We felt the hotel was good value for the money. Payment by credit card incurs a 5% cash surcharge. Phone: ----------- Fax: ---/---------"
4,1022,"Apr 25 2005 	clean hotel	I stayed in this hotel for three nights together with a friend, when I was in London for a conference. The room with two single beds was ok, clean. There is a sink in the room and if you don't mind a shared bathroom this is a good place to stay. Nothing for a romantic stay, but if you want to explore London it's good. Close to Victoria Station. Our room was on the frontside, but there is hardly any traffic in the street so it was quiet. I liked the english breakfast which was included, and I think it's pretty cheap for London. It's not possible to book the rooms via internet, you have to phone or fax them. I would stay here again if I was London"
5,1022,"Apr 9 2004	Small but comfy	My husband, 2 daughters and I stayed here 4 nights at the end of March. We had a double bed in one room and they had 2 wins in another. There is a sink in each room and bathrooms are shared on each landing. The bathroom on out landing was clean and appeared newly remodeled. Blow dryer in bathroom. There was also a half bath on the landing. Never had to wait. The rooms were very small but comforable and warm. Had a closet to put things in. Bed was not to hard (I know some people prefer hard mattresses, I don't.) Pay phone in the hall. They were a little tight with the towels. Each person given one bathtowel. No handtowel or washcloth. Teenage girls need more towels. I had brought an entra old towel along. The breakfast is included in the price and is hot and filling. Hotel is short walk from Victoria Station (about 7 min) on a quiet well-lit street. If you are only using a room to sleep while you are sightseeing it is a great buy at 45 pounds a night."
1,1026,Sep 16 2009 	You con only call it dosshouse	The TV and radio doesnt work. The coffee cups were dirty and there was noisiness all the night.
2,1026,"Sep 3 2009 	cheap London Hotel at good price you get what you pay for!	We only booked this Hotel because it was the cheapest &amp; nearest to Golders Green Tube where we needed to catch a shuttle bus to a concert.The Hotel is STILL being renovated &amp; the public lounge &amp; lobby look quite smart; however, we were in the end of the Hotel that is yet to be renovated (I hope!), the bathroom was literally in a cupboard with double, unlockable doors; the sink hit you as you stepped in &amp; the mildewy shower was to your left &amp; the toilet to your right! I have never seen anything like it in all my travels! The huge TV didn't work &amp; we only had 1 cup for 2 of us! Not all the lightng worked &amp; the double glazing wasn't the best at keeping out the noise of the busy road below us! Furnishings like the the lampshades were shabby &amp; the curtains were partially off the rail!But, the beds &amp; pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable &amp; bedding fresh &amp; clean, it was probably one of the best night's sleep in any hotel of any standard anywhere! Breakfast was nice if you like cereal &amp; toast, tea was rank &amp; coffee not much better! Cooked offering consisted of fried egg in 1/2 slice fried bread with tiny rasher of bacon &amp; similar sausage &amp; some baked beans.All in all the Hotel was cheap (49 per room per night B&amp;B) &amp; served a purpose, but it would be difficult to recommend it! It would be interesting to see it once the regeneration work is finally completed!"
3,1026,"Sep 2 2009 	Great time had by all roll on the next time	Took a family of four to the Palm Hotel in London and inspite of thinking we had arrived at the wrong place because of the modernization work we will definetly be using this hotel again.The rooms were spacious and the staff welcoming and very helpfull.The position of the hotel was perfect for using the public transport system for London,and free parking was provided by the hotel that is positioned just outside Londons congestion charge."
4,1026,"Sep 2 2009 	A value stay	We were unlucky to stay at a time when road works were being carried out on the road directly outside the room and building works were being carried out inside the hotel! The building works did not cause any problems and seemed very well organised but being a hot weekend and needing the window open, we didn't get much sleep during the night due to the road works - not anything the hotel could foresee. The only niggle about the hotel would be not having latches on the windows and with being on the ground floor we were reluctant to leave the windows open whilst not in the rooms. Having said that the staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was fine with plenty of choice and the room we stayed in was clean and tidy if a little cosy. A short walk was required to get to the tube station but the buses run regularly from close by.The all important comment is I would stay here again."
5,1026,Sep 2 2009 	Good value hotel within easy reach of central London	Staff friendly and helpful. Good reception areas. Bus stop 50 yards from hotel. Bedrooms well furnished only letdown was the bathroom which was in dire need of updating.
6,1026,"Aug 31 2009 	Absolutely apalling. Not like photo images at all!	To start with there was a mix up (not our fault) with the booking. The downstairs is impressive looking but upstairs the carpets were filthy, the tiling in the bathroom was dirty and the grouting missing in places. The lamps were dusty, dirty and did not work. The tube station is a two mile walk and then its a thirty minute journey on the tube to Oxford circus. There was a wedding on our 2nd night and the noise that the wedding guests of shouting along the corridors and banging room doors was terrible and was allowed to continue until the early hours of the morning. On the morning of leaving we noticed two rooms that had there doors opened for cleaning were the pictures of the ones we had saw on the website which i thought was quite deceiving. Will not be in this hotel again and would not recommend for anyone else to stay!"
7,1026,"Apr 30 2009 	Comfortable convenient good service noisy	This is a functional but comfortable hotel on a busy dual carriageway in the Brent Cross area of north London. I was given a double room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel (the front was covered in scaffolding and polythene sheet). The room was large, comfortable and well-equipped, as well as being away from the traffic noise; scuffed here and there and some cheapish fittings, but everything worked properly and the bathroom included a 3/4 bath as well as a shower. My only real complaint was the lack of sound insulation from other rooms: TVs on until midnight, then the first people leaving at 5.30. The restaurant wasn't serving dinner, but the receptionist organised a take-away and provided plates, cutlery etc - in fact the service overall was excellent.I didn't use the parking but it seemed quite limited and I noticed a guest arguing with the receptionist because she had been blocked in by someone else."
8,1026,"Mar 25 2009 	Not as good as it should/could be.	We knew this hotel was being upgraded. It's covered in scaffolding and smells of paint. Most alarmingly - ALL FIRE DOORS WEDGED OPEN AND SMOKE DETECTORS IN RESTAURANT COVERED WITH FOIL. Pointed this out to reception who didnt seem concerned. Booked a refurbished room, for which you pay a bit extra. Beautiful high quality fittings and lovely ideas, but must have got cowboys to do it. Very tatty work. Blind too short for window, quilt too small for bed. No drawers in room, awkward place to plug in kettle under the desk, only 1 mirror and 1 bin - in bathroom. No biscuits, no body lotion, tissues etc. Breakfast was average. SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, VERY FRIENDLY AND EFFICIENT. About 20 mins walk to tube at Golders Green, bit of a dodgy area at night?? Hotel is also on a very busy/noisy road, would benefit from triple glazing to the front. Hope it will all be finished off properly as could be really lovely, and was good value for what we wanted it for. Would stay again if the Fire Officer has been!"
9,1026,"Jan 14 2009	Quirky Hotel	Booked via Hotel as attending a weeding event at the Hotel, I must have stayed in one of the older rooms but for the price I paid I cannot complain, nice bed, good shower and superb full english breakfast. Downside was that my wrong was a bit on the noisey side, but it will not put me of if I am in North London again"
10,1026,Nov 18 2008 	Hovel	I stayed at this hotel whilst at a works conference and was gobsmacked. The pictures on the hotels website looked great and I thought it would of been a comfortable stay. How wrong was I.The Radiator had fallen off the wall therefore all you could see was the wallpaper hanging off. The lamp shade's had fallen off therefore lights were not working.The shower was disgusting there must of been 2inches of mould/limescale on the shower head.Please Please Please do not ever stay at this hotel.It isn't suitable for a dog to stay in. I only wish i had enough pics to show!!!!
11,1026,"May 3 2008 	Quiet Good Worth a stay	Booked this hotel as central london hotels were busy.Plus's are - Free car parking (Outside congestion charge zone)Free internet &amp; Bus outside takes you into Oxford street in 20 mins.Rooms abit old, but mine had a huge 26inch (I think) lcd TV in it is clear they are going through changes at present.Con's Hotel going through renovation works, but at the price I paid it will not put me off from going back"
1,1028,Aug 15 2006	What A Nightmare	This place is truly awful. My boyfriend and I spent our first 2 hours here cleaning out the bathroom and fridge - it was filthy. The rooms are drab and dirty. It 's really noisy if you are overlooking the park with buses going along all night
2,1028,Jul 15 2005	Very positive impression - cannot wait to come back	I travel to London quite frequently as a tourist. Over the years I tried other hotels but never got such good vaue for my money as in the Parkside Hotel
3,1028,Mar 17 2005	Comfortable and clean	We just needed somewhere to stay for one night
4,1028,Jan 26 2005	Pleasant stay at the Parkside	After reading the other reviews about the hotel
5,1028,Dec 29 2004	don't even have to look	We booked into this hotel because it is near the tube that goes to Heathrow BUT do not even waste your time with Parkside. We planned to stay for 2 nights but moved out immediately the next day. The beds in our room move on their own. I am not kidding you. We asked the front desk and they gave me a cold reply
6,1028,Jul 14 2004	Do not stay here	We stayed at the Parkside for 5 nights at the beginning of June. All the rooms we were offered reaked of smoke smells or a dissinfectant smell. We opted for a suite (joke) at least we could let fresh air in but at a cost of very loud traffic noise all night. There is no lift so you have to climb very steep stairs with all your luggage! There is a pub next door which is noisy until midnight
7,1028,Jan 21 2004 	Decent enough	While it's no competitor to Claridge's
1,1038,"FAB-U-LOUS	Excellent value hotel in great location. Called myself and negotiated great rate for bed and breakfast. Good size room (studio) with large bathroom. Clean and comfortable. Very good food especially the room service curry!! All the staff we came into contact with were helpful, efficient and friendly. It only took 15 minutes to walk to the Eye along the river passed the Houses of Parliament so great location. Was very pleased with this hotel and would stay again."
2,1038,"Nov 19 2009 	Great location	I attended a conference here and the event organisers also book us in the hotel. The layout of the hotel was a little different than you would expect with the reception being tucked away from the main entrance. My room was spacious, the bed comfy and bathroom was great.The only downside was the dirty looking carpets and the absence of an iron and ironing board in the my room."
3,1038,"Nov 13 2009 	Let down by detail	I only spent a night here on business and so am unable to give any real detailed observations but here are some of my thoughts on the Park Plaza Riverbank.First impressions and the hotel itself looks great, from the lit-up exterior to the ultra modern reception and bar area. It is, like most Park Plazas I've been to, prone to extreme darkness inside and the windowless atmosphere could get to some but I don't really find this to be a problem.Check in was fine and the staff that I met were very friendly and more than happy to help - I'd left my scarf in the bar area on the previous evening and the chap at reception actually left his post to go and didg it out for me, so top marks there!Dig a bit deeper though and there are problems. The room, whilst being very nice, had simply not been cleaned properly. I had a massive stain on the carpet by my window and this is pretty much unacceptable for a four star so-called &quot;luxury&quot; hotel. I could not get either the lights or the tv to work poperly (lights wouldn't go off and tv wouldn't come on) - I would normally put this down to my own inability to work the simplest of technology until I learnt that a number of my colleagues (some who had stayed there on the same evening as me and others who had stayed there earlier) had exactly the same problem. I was also unlucky enough to have a window facing a main line railway and was woken a number of times early the next morning by the first trains running by, be aware of this when checking in and try and get a room away from the line.All in all, not a bad hotel but disappointing in that it really could be much better if it were to eliminate such minor details."
4,1038,"Nov 4 2009 	Dirty rooms conflicting service	When we first checked in, I was excited....looked like a great hotel and check in was friendly. Then, I saw my room (and apparently I wasn't the only ones with the same concerns). The room was tidy, but not all together clean....specifically the carpet. I don't know when they last vacuumed or steam cleaned those carpets. Wearing my socks, within one minute, they were black. Noted that over the three nights I was there, carpet cleaning was not a priority (there were pieces of paper and hair left over from the vaccuum. Day staff were fine and actually quite good. Night staff was horrible. Rude, no smiles and one had the gall to ask for a tip after being rude. The night concierge had attitude and didn't send up a bell hop when we requested his assistance. Won't be going back.....a shame."
5,1038,Nov 2 2009 	Lovely hotel	Just returned from a weekend break at this hotel. The accommodation was excellent even although we did not have a river view ........ how long do you stay in your room on a break in London anyway. The bathroom with walk in shower wa particularly nice. My only complaint concerned the service in the hotel bar. Having been out on the Saturday evening we returned to have a night cap and waere confronted by an agressive demand to know if we were residents. When I said we were the barman demanded to see our room key - again agressively. Apart from this incident the rhe service was exemplary. I would return again
6,1038,"Nov 2 2009 	Looks can be deceiving	From the website, the Park Plaza gives off the aura of a comfy, contemporary hotel with fab view over the Thames. Be afraid, be very afraid. I checked in, looking for a relaxing weekend full of sleep and shopping, but the minute I got to my room I knew it was not to be. The room was little more than 10ft from the tube lines and you could wave to the passing passengers - NICEI turned on my heels and headed straight back to reception to ask for a different room. The only one they could offer was on the 11th floor which the receptionist said was much quieter. Thus off I marched, and yes it was quiet but at the expense of roasting me half to death. The a/c was useless and the window was locked. I also discovered a vent to the right of my window that was constantly on the go giving off a low annoying hum. With no alternative I headed off to find some earplugs, but even with them stuffed in my ears I could still hear a drone from the vent at night. As for the bathroom, a light remained on even at night and if you didnt close the wardrobe properly the light from that shone like the Blackpool illuminations. The bath itself was half under the bathroom shelf and the shower cubicle was like washing in a goldfish bowel. I found the staff very standoffish and unfriendly and the maids woke you up at stupid o clock with loud crashing &amp; banging. Relaxing this was not!"
7,1038,"Oct 29 2009 	Aims high falls short but still not bad	If I'd paid the walk in price of over 200 a night I would have been disappointed. The hotel is obviously trying to give the impression of a high class establishment but the devil is in the details:- Stuck on the side of the desk next to the bed is a sticker &quot;Embankment Stores 99p&quot;- the bathroom mirror has strange paint markings, - the window downlight makes noisy creaking noises as it cools down long after it is switched off (i.e. when you are trying to get to sleep)- the meal ordered up was missing one of the components listed in the menu- I had to drap the iron and the whole ironing board it is permanently attached to into the batthroom to fill it up with water - etc...Such details give the impression of a management culture whose heart into the job of living up to the standards the hotel superficially boasts.However I (my company) paid a negotiated rate of 125 - and at this price this hotel is the best I've stayed at in London."
8,1038,"Oct 25 2009 	nice rooms - but disorganised	when I travel on business I look for a hotel with decent rooms, edible breakfast, and an efficient front desk. In this hotel the rooms are fine, bathrooms particularly good, the breakfast is also good. What let it down for me was the front desk - they couldn't find my booking - even when I showed them the confirmation - and I had to hang about while they phoned the booking agent. The best bit was when I said - just give me a room and I will pay for it myselfcan't do that sir we are fully bookedwell what is the point of phoning the agent?well if they did make a booking then we won't be fully booked any more!Nice view of Westminster from the room but if I were a tourist this is not a part of London I would select - well away from the West end, museums etc - apart from the Tate across the river"
9,1038,"Oct 20 2009 	Well presented contemporary hotel	I stayed here for one night, and it is certainly a city hotel that I would return to.The room and bathroom were very spacious, with a separate bath and shower cubicle (wet room style). The only downside to the room was that you needed earplugs if you didnt want to hear the train coming past your window! The lighting in the bedroom was quite subdued, so ladies if you need to put on your makeup you definitely need to use the bathroom!The reception area and bar areas are well designed with clever use of lighting.Breakfast the following morning was great, loads of choice of hot and cold food.Overall a nice hotel that is well situated for westminster/waterloo areas."
10,1038,"Oct 19 2009 	I Did not need an Alarm Clock!!!	I stayed for two nights at the Park Plaza in October 2009 and I have to say that this was the worst stay I have ever had in London. As a regular traveller to London for both Business and pleasure I have stayed at a variety of Hotels but none as bad as this.The web site shows magnificent views over the River Thames. What it does not show you is that a lot of the rooms look out onto the Main Railway line south from London !!!. Trains run from 0500hrs in the morning until 0100hrs the next day. Added to this the toilet in my room broke down. The breakfast in the hotel was also very poor with queues for up to 10 minutes waiting to be seated. When I complained, I was not moved to a different room. This is not a Hotel for business people who need a good nights sleep"
11,1038,"Oct 16 2009 	Not designed for sleeping or washing	This is a very clean and smart hotel in a good location and the staff are pleasant. But I couldn't sleep, and that was really all I wanted. This was because strange random lights are stashed all over the room. An orange one, a green one, a flashing lilac one. The bathroom light doesn't go off at all. And there are no bedside lights, just horribly bright ceiling lights above the bed. So much of my night was spent wandering around in the dark with folded bits of cardboard trying to isolate and cover them. (They disappeared when I switched the main floodlights on although admittedly by this point I was disorientated due to sleep deprivation.) These desperate little expeditions were punctuated by howls and screams each time my feet or ankles collided with the vicious divan base of the bed. At one point rolling on bed, drumming fists, sobbing in agony and frustration.... Why would a room be designed in this way? A BEDROOM? I'm willing to overlook half of the bath being under the bathroom shelf. I could live with the extortionate 5 tray charge I had to hand over before the breakfast tray was mine (though sadly not the deep fried vegetarian breakfast - inedible), the fact it took 25 minutes to fill a lukewarm bath, the fact that I requested a smoking room and the hotel is entirely non smoking (had they warned me when the booking was made it would have been OK but they didn't). So yes, its fabulous so long as sleeping and hot water are not top of your list for creature comforts. Had the stay been longer than a night I'd have had to stay somewhere else. Never again."
12,1038,"Oct 13 2009 	Absolutely fantastic top class hotel and service	I booked this hotel for a surprise for my partners birthday. Had previously stayed at the park Plaza County Hall which was also impressive but wanted to try the Riverbank. I was hoping to book a room with a river view but unfortunately this was unavailable at the time of booking. I explained that it was for a borthday and was told that we would be upgraded, upon arrival, should one become available. When we arrived at the hotel, we were both very implressed with the interior and the wonderful staff on reception. We were asked if it was a special occassion as a note had been left on our booking. We were then offerred the upgrade to a room with a river view. The room was very clean and comfortable. The view was amazing !!!! After taking our bags to our room, we went down to the bar to have a couple of drinks where we were again served to a very high standard. The decor and ambience in the bar was just what we wanted. The staff also arranged for a balloon to be bought up to the room in the morning with breakfast. Room service was very quick and all staff very polite and could not do enough for you.The hotel is in a good location, a walk along the river took you to the major attractions, the London Eye, Houses of Parliament etc.We really could not of asked for a more pleasant experience and wished we were staying longer. Will definately be going back."
13,1038,"Oct 12 2009 	Contemporary Chic and oh so fabulous	Fantasic hotel on the Albert Embankment. Best check in ever, staff very friendly, polite and helpful.I was offered breakfast at a reduced price of 10 per person which I jumped at. Room was massive, super furnishing and a great size bathroom. Booked hotel through Last Min.com and paid 69 for a double room. Fantastic value for money.Chino Latino bar was really relaxing with a great staff who really know their drinks , te drinks come with a dish of japanese rice crackers, wasabi peanuts and the hottest wasabi peas I have ever tasted. I also had the tempura prawns which came with a creamy chilli sauce they were delicious.Room service was very quick we ordered two meals and they were delivered within ten mins.Upon check out when going through the bill I happened to mention that we didnt make breakfast as we overslept and they refunded my 20 !!!!!! Never before has that ever happened as it was our fault we missed it, So this was a really nice touch which made our break even more enjoyable."
14,1038,"Oct 9 2009 	An absolutely wonderful experience	As we have always wanted to stay in a hotel overlooking the Thames, we booked an Executive Room with riverview which also included in the price the use of the Executive Lounge between 6.30pm and 8.30pm for free drinks (lager, red/white wine and soft drinks) and snacks (day 1 calamari, crudites and dips, day 2 meatballs, fish, pitta bread and dips). The staff in the Lounge were very friendly and efficient, as soon as your glass was almost empty someone was there ready to top you up. We would definitely recommend booking an Executive Riverview room as the views over the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben were absolutely stunning. As we wanted to wake up to the view, we were able to sleep with the curtains open as we were not overlooked from anywhere. The cost of the room was justified by the Executive Lounge as you were able to have as much or as little as you wanted to eat and drink and we were a little surprised that some people were only having 1 drink when everything was &quot;free&quot;.The staff at breakfast were very welcoming. On Saturday the breakfast was chosen from a menu which had a good variety of choice. We were also able to help ourselves to anything on the continental table (smoked salmon, cheese, ham, pastries etc). On Sunday, breakfast was self service from a table which included bacon, sausuages, eggs etc along with the choice from the continental table. The only down side to breakfast was that the coffee was extremely strong and thick and the tea was extremely weak and tasteless.The Park Plaza Riverbank was definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed at and we would definitely recommend anyone to go here for the same amazing experience which we had."
15,1038,"Oct 8 2009	London to Glasgow	We flew in late into Heathrow and caught the Dot to Dot bus to our hotel on the River, the Park PLaza. London is fabulous in late MArch! We walked the Thames to the Eye, saw Big Ben and Parliament in the first hour we we there.Our first full day our friends arrived, checked in, we had breakfast and set out. Took the bus right in front of the hotel to Churchill's Museum, his offices during the war. Well worth the small entrance fee. We then walked to St. Paul's, gorgeous!!!Had lunch in the London Pub, rode the bus to Westminister Cathedral, not Abbey. A little sad and shabbey but beautiful nonetheless. Our friend came back to mass that evening then we were off to dinner at a pub recommended by the hotel concierage. It was great and local and vibrant.Following morning we were off to Glasgow and 10 days driving in Scotland. Can't wait to return!!"
16,1038,"Oct 2 2009 	really accommodating. very happy!	We booked a room via lastminute.com as it was my husband's birthday. We wanted to be tourists in our own city. Our 7 year old was also with us, and the hotel was more than happy to bring a rollaway bed into the room, free of charge. They called me a couple times to verify that, and I also called to check in about it the day before. Funnily enough, lastminute.com gave me more grief about it. The room was modern and lovely, but also cosy. the room service was very reasonably priced. The staff was international and ever-so-friendly, always happy to help.In short i would LOVE to stay here again and i WILL recommend this hotel to family, friends and collegues.I book travel for my business and I will definitely use this hotel for those reasons also.Thanks for a lovely weekend!"
17,1038,"Sep 30 2009 	Nice hotel	Myself and my mum stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. It is located a 10 minute walk from Vauxhall Underground Station and Vauxhall Bus Station.The hotel is easily accessible for the London Eye, Southbank and Big Ben etc. To get to other places in London the bus station has very frequent buses which take you almost anywhere.The hotel was nice and aesthetically pleasing. It was generally clean and tidy, with a very nice lobby. The staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were spacious and had everything needed for a comfortable stay.The breakfast package was nice but the dining hall was always very busy. They tried their best to accomodate everybody and put people in conference rooms (we dined in those both days) which were quiet and comfortable.The same sort of applied to the lifts also, every morning we struggled to get a lift down to breakfast, as everytime we called one it was full by the time it got to us on the 2nd floor.Overall a pleasant hotel which I would stay in again."
18,1038,"Sep 25 2009 	Wierd lights and loud noises...	After reading some of the reviews on this site I was a bit apprehensive about staying here, as I was afraid that we would be given one of the rooms overlooking the train tracks. Much to my dismay we were! However before asking to change rooms I decided to see if the noise really was that bad. Much to my relief after hearing a few trains go by I decided that it really wasn't that bad.However the soundproofing inside the hotel is horrible! I could hear the person next door walking around their bathroom...running the water...etc...In the morning I was woken up early by the maids having a gossip outside my door...I pointedly put out my &quot;do not disturb sign&quot; however that did not deter them! From 8am on there was no point trying to sleep as every few minutes a different set of maids (or maybe the same ones again and again) would come and loudly gossip outside my door. Arg! The lighting in the room was terrible. I like to read before bed and my boyfriend likes to go right to sleep, but there was no bedside lamp! We had to have the overhead lights on, or no lights at all.And then...the strange light in the bathroom corner that does not turn out ever. Why? To waste electricity? I got to spend a lot of time thinking about the light while listening to the maids...goodie gumdrops!"
19,1038,Sep 25 2009 	Excellent Hotel	I stayed in this hotel for 1 night in September. I arrived late in the evening (10pm) and the receptionist was very helpful and efficient (helpful after a 5 hour train journey). I was given an upgrade to a riverside suite and had a fantastic view of the Thames and the House of Commons. I used the Gym but it was fairly basic - a few bikes and treadmills. Breakfast was fine but is the area I think could be improved the most.
20,1038,"Sep 20 2009 	Good location enyoyed our stay after we asked for a change of rooms	Myself and my wife stayed here for 3 nights in Sept '09.We were attending a wedding which was being held in the hotel. First impressions the hotel was very clean, modern and inviting. Staff were friendly and could not do enough for us.On arrival our bags were brought to our room and initially the room seemed fine but two mins later we realised that the main train line passed directly under our room be it 10 floors down. The room also had some, but not all of its carpet replaced for some reason and it was not done professionally and I nearly fell over it on entering the room. it looked very ragged especially around the door. Also the shower had a curtain which was definetly in need of changing.That evening we asked for a change in rooms (never had to ask before in any hotel) and the staff gladly said yes but we would have to stay the first night in our room. We didn't get much sleep the first night due to the trains passing every 5 mins or so.The next morning we changed rooms and ended up in a very quiet location with a view of the Thames from the side. This room was finished to a higher standard and we had no complaints.Breakfast was very good with a good selection of hot and cold dishes. I used the gym which was adequate for a hotel gym. The wedding was fantastic. The reception was held in a room overlooking the river Thames. The setting was amazing. Food was very good and the staff very accommodationg.Overall a good hotel which i would recommend to others but was not happy with the first room which we ended up staying the first night in."
21,1038,"Sep 13 2009 	In one word.....Perfection!	I have stayed at many 4 star hotels in London over the years, none of them compares to the Park Plaza Riverside. I was a bit worried when I booked it about the location as I wanted to be central for my children.....I had nothing to worry about, it was a lovely 10 minute walk along the bank of the Thames to Big Ben, London Eye and the houses of Parliament. The nearest tube station is only 5 minutes walk. We booked into a family Riverside View room, it certainly exceeded our expectations, we loved it. The room was very spacious with the children sleeping on the sofa bed in the lounge and a separate bedroom for my husband and I. The view we had was amazing overlooking Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Robes and Slippers were provided for everyone, chocolates on arrival in the room, bowl of fruit and some little finger puppets for my children which I thought was a lovely touch. Again the bathroom was very modern and spacious with a bath and separate shower area. Shampoo, shaving cream, toothpaste .....you name it, was provided.The Flat screen TV was not working properly in the lounge area, I rang down and reported it and within 5 minutes we had a gentleman fixing the problem and even got a follow up call from reception asking if everything was fixed and working OK. I rang housekeeping for extra pillows again, within 5 minutes they were at the door.......the staff are so helpful and friendly, service is second to none.The restaurant &quot; Chino Latino&quot; is certainly the place to eat at......do not miss it, the food and again service is fantastic.All in all I can not say enough wonderful thing's about this hotel, everything was perfect.I would not stay at any other hotel in London. We all look forward to returning very soon.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
22,1038,"Sep 13 2009 	FAntastic Hotel..Best in London	Having stayed in several London hotels this year I have to say this is the best deal in town. The location is fantastic and the hotels exterior can fool you but on entering you are met with a stunning reception very swish and slick.the staf are very genuine and helpful and I never felt formal.They are there to help and they do.I paid les than 3100 for a double room with breakfast and I have to say it was modern stylish comfortable and very ggod value. the bathrroms and shoers are very cool.One drawback is the internet connection which is quite slow, Thee is no radio or alarm in the room and the TV has an over subscription to Arab based stations.Apart from that I sincerely think its the bestdeal in ton and I cant waitt o stay there again"
23,1038,"Sep 12 2009 	Modern Classy Hotel	Stayed here whilst in London, able to check in early to leave our luggage, room was very modern, flat screen TV and all the usual amenities. The interior of the hotel is quite dark and our bedroom was on the inside of the building so we never saw daylight!Room service was efficient and of good quality, staff were polite and helpful.As a place to stay on business I would recommend it, as along as you are going somewhere in the Waterloo/Westminster/Vauxhall/Pimlico area, although the buses and tube take you to other parts of London fairly easily."
24,1038,"Sep 12 2009 	Close to Vauxhall Station	This is a very modern looking hotel, however the maintenance is not being kept up on it unfortunately. The carpets in the halls were dirty and stained and didn't seem to be clean. Our A/C was broken when we arrived, the drain in the shower was plugged and we needed to call the front desk 3 times to get them to unlock the refrigerator in the room.It is a 10 minute walk to the Vauxhall train and underground station which makes it very easy to get around London. There are not many restaurants to choose from at this location. There is a small pub down the street and the restaurant in the hotel.The hotel is located just south of the Lambeth bridge on the Albert Embankment (across from the Tate Britain museum)"
25,1038,"Sep 5 2009 	Excellent Service	We had a very pleasant stay at the Park Plaza Riverbank. It has a wonderful view of the Thames and is walking distance from Parliament and the London Eye. The only drawback was the distance to the tube station, especially when it was raining! I recommend becoming familiar with the bus system because there is a bus stop in front of the hotel, much more convenient. The concierge staff was extremely helpful (thanks Thom) and the rooms were beautiful, spacious, and clean. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and would love to stay at this location again,"
26,1038,"Aug 30 2009 	Comfortable hotel in great location	Recently stayed with my husband at this hotel. Booked through hotels direct on the phone. Great location on the South Bank, not right in the heart of all the bustle, but only a short walk away. On good bus routes to waterloo.Room was a reasonable size for London, clean, comfortable and staff were friendly. Would stay there again."
27,1038,"Aug 27 2009 	Excellent Service	Had a great stay, we booked a standard 'superior', room got there and they said we had a free upgrade. We were taken to a special reception area and checked in to a luxury suite, and wow was it Luxury, Living area with kitchen and large flat TV, All very clean and tidy. Very posh bathroom with walk in shower all Marble and Glass. Bed very comfy. Probably only get a free upgrade like that once in a lifetime but it was well worth the experience.Have stayed there before in a standard room, and it was very good too, but not quite the same Breakfast was excellent too.Will stay there again, there always hope we will get another upgrade I supose."
28,1038,"Aug 26 2009 	Large Rooms Nice location for strolling poor room service needs repairs	I have lived here Mon-Fri for nearly a year, so am very much turning in to Alan Partridge (though not got the large plate yet).Staff - Excellent, always very nice, pleasant and helpful.BUT - The turn down service is annoying for me. They come at 18:30, close the curtains, turn ON??? the tv and tuck in the sheets. NO sweets on the pillows :((( hahaRooms - OK, will make it harder for me to get a room, BUTDON'T stay or take a room at the back, take ones closest to the road/rive/front.The back is Waterloo train station and Noisy.The best rooms are the ones that point towards Parliament.The inside/atrium ones are bit pointless as you have to keep the net curtain closed, so why come to London and have no view.They are in need of some 'sprucing-up'. Bathrooms need new seals around the shower doors, some power points a bit loose, drains in showers can smell a little. However they are large, cleanish and nice TV's. FOOD - Room service is poor. Sorry but only way to put it. If you stay and eat in your room, then you standard food. Fish is either rubbery, or doused in strong sauces (old fish???)Cafe Latino is amazing food. However if you are on holiday just eat out.Location - Ten mins walk from Vauxhall tube, 15 from Waterloo, which is fine for me.Great for romantic strolls along the river, to the Southbank, Parliament etc. (not that I would know).Isn't in the middle of it, but that can be nice after a hectic day shopping/site seeing, to have a nice stroll along the river."
29,1038,"Aug 25 2009 	Lovely hotel	Stayed here to watch Ashes at the Oval- excellent location for this. From the moment we arrived (early yet room was still available to us) to the time we left we found all the staff to be friendly, helpful and the generally to be outstanding. Breakfast was a plentiful and varied buffet and our room was cleaned to a very high standard with the toiletries and towels replenished as required. We used travel cards to sightsee round London and used these on both the tubes( 5mins to Vauxhall Station - 15mins to Westminster) and the buses - stops either side of road opposite hotel which allow you to get to the vast majority of attractions with a minimum of changes - preferred the buses due to being able to see London as you travelled. As has been said before the rooms have varied outlooks- as far as we could make out even numbers seem to face into the courtyard so opposite other windows - odd numbers face out and range from the railway to the executive rooms with river views. Overall we can recommend this hotel and will be returning."
30,1038,"Aug 21 2009 	Riverbank retreat	My partner and i stayed in the Park Plaza Riverbank hotel on the 19/08/09. Upon our arrival the hotel entrance was really lovely and the staff were firendly. Unfortunately, our room was facing the train station at the back which wasn't a great sight but never the less a really nice room. The bathroom was modern and clean. But the smell when we first walked into the room wasn't very pleasan, possibly because of the fumes from the station behind.We only stayed for one night so the breakfast was our only meal here as we ate out. The breakfast was very good as you could help yourself and if you are very hungry you can go back for seconds."
31,1038,Aug 18 2009 	Nice hotel location not too great	I stayed here for a mix of pleasure and business. I worked the day before and morning after and then headed out into London for the remainder of the day and the rest of the weekend. This is a nice hotel but the location is a little tricky. Better located hotels in London.
32,1038,"Aug 17 2009 	Fantastic location wonderfully modern clean 	We were on an organised trip where we got dropped and picked up from this hotel and in between did what you liked. The hotel was a perfect location for walking into London along the embankment to the the area of Westiminster, hardly needed to use the tube at all. Hotel staff booked the coach load in very quickly and for those who wanted to get off sight seeing straight away were able to leave our luggage very quickly and smoothly. Breakfast was buffet style and served everything anyone would want!"
33,1038,"Aug 16 2009 	Not worth paying for an executive room	We stayed at this hotel for 1 Saturday night and paid for an executive roomThe only enhancement was additional shampoo, dental and shaving gearThe executive lounge was CLOSED - access is only available at 18.30 when they serve canapes which consists of meatballs and dishes of crisps with a glass of cheap wineNo newspapers , a vending machine for coffee and nothing else - very very poorNo paper delivered to the room either in the morningI would strongly advise not booking an executive and go for a bog standard as there is little or no differenceWe did let reception know this and they were sorry - great!Also do NOT pat for the on site parking at 30 which you cannot booki am glad we didn't as there is on street parking in all the street to the rear of the hotel free at weekendsWon;t stay here again and would return to the Hilton at Docklands once the Jubilee line is working at weekends again - much better."
34,1038,"Aug 8 2009 	Nice location-hotel needs work	This hotel is located on the Thames River very close to Parliament and Westminster Abbey. Upon walking in the lobby we were very impressed with the decor and cleanliness of the hotel. Everything went downhill from there. We went to check in at 12 pm after taking a redeye flight from the US. We were told that if we waited two hours we would receive quieter rooms. We were exhausted from our travels but felt it would be worth the wait especially traveling with an 8 month old. We returned at 2 pm and were told our rooms were available. We were shocked when the doors to the elevator opened and were greeted by a filthy hallway. The carpet looked like it hadn't been cleaned or vacuumed in years. There were greasy tire marks from the housekeeping carts and other filth all over. We were hoping the room would be better. Our room did not impress. The carpet in our room looked just as dirty as the hallway and our bed had hair on the sheets. There was also hair in the bathtub and sink. We were also in the back of the hotel where there are many trains that pass by all day long. We had no idea why we were made to wait two hours when we were in the noisy section of the hotel. When we called the front desk to talk about the problems, they offered to send someone to clean the room or pay an additional 45 pounds per night to have a quieter room. This is after we were already paying over $200 per night. We opted to stay where we were and have someone come clean our room, but after we were able to rest and get cleaned up from our travels. When we were leaving our room, someone was there to clean. I was hoping to come back to a cleaner, more inviting room. We came back to discover that the housekeeper had just cleaned up what we had used to get ready and that there was still hair all over. Upon returning from our trip, I filled out a survey about our stay letting them know that we will never stay in their hotel again. To my surprise, I received an email from the VP in the UK, but he was offering me a free three day upgrade if I paid to stay there again in the next year. Are you kidding me? My family will definitely not be returning to this hotel. We will be staying at the hotel we stayed at in Kensington-Earl Court area (Hogarth) previously. The rooms are smaller, but half the price and spotless. Please be wary of staying at this hotel."
35,1038,Jul 26 2009 	WONDERFUL STAY	took my son on a weekend to London this hotel was excellent staff very helpfull concierge was exceptional very knowlegeable ate in club lounge again staff excellent One slight disappointment non exsistant view although we did not spend much time in room it would have been nice to see the river.
36,1038,Jul 23 2009 	Awesome Hotel at a decent price	Booked this hotel by chance from one of the discount hotel websites and were pleasantly surprised. Definitely a four star hotel in my book. Hotel's decor was extremely modern and high class. Room was clean and a decent size with a brand new spa like bathroom. It had window even though it looked out at a wall. Didn't eat at the restaurant but it looked nice. Entire staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Definitely a good value for your money.Location may have been the only not so great thing about the hotel. While it is on the River and extremely close to Underground stations it was a bit of a walk from the nightlife. Cabs weren't hard to come by though and it was easy enough to catch one into the city.
37,1038,"Jul 22 2009 	handy for the riverside and south bank	Good clean and spacious accommodation close to the Thames and in easy reach of the South Bank. not as well located as other park plazas in london, with a short walk to the tube (Vauxhall) and further to travel to find reasonable restaurants etc..The hotel is close to the Waterloo mainline tracks but i cant say i noticed. Also i might be wary of where you venture outside at night towards Vauxhall, otherwise no problem.Breakfast good value and choice.Free WI-FI.Room decor might not be to everyone's taste - a distinct oriental theme in the room i stayed in, with a life size geisha painted on the wall - I'm sure her jacket glows in the dark too - spooky!"
38,1038,"Jul 19 2009 	Worst 4 star hotel in London?	Stayed for one night, riverside suite. Door of double wardrobe fell completely off it's hinges upon entering room, narrowly missing me! This took an hour of a workman being in room to fix preventing us getting ready to go out. We asked to move but were told it was not possible. Bathroom had mould on ceiling all around shower the whole suite was not very clean and the carpet was very dirty and stained. Management seemed very unconcerned."
39,1038,"Jul 12 2009 	Excellent hotel with relaxing surroundings but BUSY main railway directly behind hotel	We chose the hotel for a change of location to the normal stay in the city and so opted for this hotel on the River Thames.Arrived to a nicely spacious hotel reception and inviting bar lounge, we found the staff were friendly &amp; helpfull upon arrival.We were given a complimentry upgraded to an executive suite room and when we saw the room we loved it, it was spacious &amp; stylishly decorated. The bathroom was also spacious and had a bath with a seperate shower cubicle. Extra compliments were bath robes and shower/bath slippers and extra toiletries. The other extra room with the suite had a sofa, table &amp; chairs along with extra draw space and mini bar For a relaxed atmosphere we had low warm coloured lighting infront of the blackout blinds to the windows.However i heard and noticed from the view/windows we were directly below the main railway line form Vauxhall to Waterloo, my thoughts were being a light sleeper its gonna be noisy early in the morning onwards with trains back &amp; forth. I called reception for a possible room change taking this into account, but the hotel was busy so we could not change till the next day if we still wanted too. A room was reserved for us on request which was helpfull if we did have a restless night.I was right from 5am trains were or seemed to be operating every 3-5 minutes, disturbing my sleep to a point i was counting the trains go by hoping i would drift back to sleep. After we had breakfast we confirmed we would like to change our room and we were moved to a quiter room on the far side near the front. Although a lot smaller room ( probably a standard/typical room) it still had similar qualities like seperate bath &amp; shower and decor, although no bath robes, slippers or extra toiletries were in this room. It was nice though to have the Thames view &amp; a quite room away from the busy railway line. A good sleep was had that second night since relocating. Breakfast was excellent so much to choose from hot or cold, with plenty meat or vegi options catered for. We ate in the hotel one night and the food was again equally enoyable and reasonable, on offer that night was a pasta buffet for 8.50 but a glass of wine was 5 &amp; a now standard service charge of 12% also added In the hotel bar it was the same, price wise but that is expected from hotels in London but it was again a nice stylish bar with a relaxing atmosphere ideal for a relaxing drink before or after a night on the town.Bear in mind its location, when we went the Victoria line was closed for the whole weekend (Sat &amp; Sunday) for engineering works, so we had to walk everytime to Westminster to get connections to move around the city. I do recommend if your a light sleeper, make sure you request a quiter room from the moment you book it or at least when you check in espacilly in the summer.Overall a very nice hotel that offers that bit extra in comfort BUT do bare in mind the location, espacilly if engineer works do occur over the weekend &amp; with this hotel you do need to rely on the underground to get around the city. It took us around 20 minutes from the hotel to walk to the nearest tube station at Westminster if the Victoria line is closed for works."
40,1038,"Jul 12 2009 	Best Hotel I have ever stayed in.	The friendliest staff, the most modern rooms, the best toiletries, fantastic location. what more could you want. This hotel would be suitable for anyone. Very quiet rooms. Fantastic Breakfasts. Fantastic bar. Just amazing. Ten Minutes from Vauxhall Tube Station and 15 Minutes from the London Eye and Westminster. Minutes from the Imperial War Museum and excellent tube links to Kings Cross, St Pancreas and Euston. Very Difficult to fault. May not be cheap but is certainly good value for money."
41,1038,"Jun 30 2009 	great location friendly staff	I have now stayed at this hotel three times in the last two years. My first visit was for a competition I had won with Aussie Hair Care to stay the night and although I had not stayed before, me and my partner had decided to stay an extra night as we felt it would have been a wasted journey otherwise. When we arrived at the hotel I couldn't believe how nice it actually was and looks exactly as it did on their website. Each time that we have stayed the reception staff have always been friendly and booked us in promptly. If the room wasn't ready when we got there, we were able to keep our baggage with the concierge who was very helpful. The rooms are lovely and beds are extremely comfy, and after a long journey on the train, they are good to have a quick nap on before having a wonder round to see the sights. We have been on the London Eye twice whilst staying in London as its approximately 10 minutes walk, and a lovely walk it is too. You get to walk right opposite the houses of parliament and Big Ben and you can take some great photographs. You are also in walking distance of trafalgar square, covent garden and leicester square. You are close to a bus route too which will get you to these places if you don't really like to walk, but as we have stayed in the summer 2/3 times, the walk has been great. There is an amusement arcade, mcdonalds and the aquarium right near the london eye. I would definately recommend this hotel for your stay."
42,1038,Jun 22 2009 	Watch the 'river view' promise	Quite a good hotel with great facilities and super 'executive' package - great breakfast in 'private' club room.The big disappointment was that our 'Special Requirement' of a river view room was totally ignored and changed to 'if available' - that certainly wasn't the consumer expectation - it's this hotel's big differentiator - get them to commit - else don't stay there.
43,1038,Jun 20 2009 	grossly expensive.. tiniest possible rooms	leave aside its name.. its grand lobby area.. and the restaurant.. enter the room n u wl cry ur heart out wondering u have entered a 5 star room or just your regular tiny london hotel room.. like i said.. other than the room everything else is magnifique but then dont we spend most of the time in the room once inside the hotel.. rooms are really nothing much to write home about.. if one has to stay in a tiny room then why pay sooooo much.. better to stay in a 70 GBP room only rather than a 150 GBP one then.. it surely has it pros like its great location with big ben n london eye within 5-10 mnts walking distance... but being the prudent traveller i am.. i would rather recommend a cheaper hotel.. like the local UK brands and not the international ones like this.. 70 GBP for a similar kinda room is what i feel i would pay.. so next time when i was in London.. i stayed in a 70 GBP one for which i am posting a review too... n ws equally satisfied.. extra 70-80 pounds that i paid for this didnt gave me real value.. go for it if you are one of those ' i stay only in 5 stars guy' else move to a cheaper one..
44,1038,"Jun 19 2009 	great hotel fantastic location	the place to stay in London ! across the river from the parlament &amp;view of BIG BEN !!! London eye in walking distance,and so is the imperial war museum &amp;Tate Britain .Did I mentioned the price? 80 euro/room .b y all means ,go there !"
45,1038,"Jun 16 2009 	First Class	Stayed at the Park Plaza on business last week and my first impression was &quot;WOW&quot; I must be in the wrong hotel............knowing the prices of central London hotels and the budget allowance my company allocates, I was sure there had been a mistake!!!But on checking my booking with reception they confirmed I was in the right place!!!!Check in was swift and my room was ready although I was 2 hours earlier than the advertised arrival time.The room was fabulous all dark wood and clean white linen and the bathroom was to die for.The bedroom and bathroom were spotless and the bed was very comfortable.Unfortunately I had a view of a railway line but not a big issue and reasonable double glazing meant I was not disturbed by train noise.My toilet broke, late on the first night of my stay ,but with in 10 mins of reporting the fault a member of staff appeared to fix it. When it couldn't be fixed immediately they offered me an alternative room and moved me with no fuss and lots of apologies. The hotel was conveniently located for me to attend all of my business meetings in the Milbank area, about a 10 minute stroll over Lambeth Bridge, and would be well situated for sight seeing around the Westminster Area for tourists.Breakfasts were good, a self serve buffet of cooked food, including vegetarian options, and a variety of fruits, juices, pastries and cereals. Tea and coffee were served at your table.Overall a first class hotel, with helpful, professional staff and a good London location."
46,1038,"Jun 16 2009 	Hard to beat	Booked through Last Minute.com which, after hours of trawling the net, offered the best price. Rooms were very clean if a little small - but no smaller than you would expect for London if I am being honest. Nice to have a big/deep bath in a spotlessly clean bathroom. Location was good and only a fifteen minute walk to Trafalgar Square. Staff were very good and if I had to gripe about something it would have to be that the bar area was very, very busy in the evenings. Think a lot of people come to eat in the restaurant (which gets extremely crowded at weekends so you need to book even if staying in the hotel). The breakfast (which was definitely the most expensive I have ever eaten) was excellent. If I managed to get another good rate I would go back for sure."
47,1038,"Jun 12 2009 	first class	great hotel,clean,friendly staff,walking distance to main attractions eg trafalgar square,westminster abbey,big ben ect,good breakfast,large rooms.beautiful view house parliament on river thames,quite rooms.good internet/business service,coffee machine and washing machine in room(apartment)restaurant and bar on site"
48,1038,"Jun 3 2009 	Great location and staff are brilliant	stayed here on business since Nov08 to May09 and the staff are great, they make your stay really welcome.The hotel is next to Lambeth Bridge, the one next to Westminster bridge so it's far enough away from Leicester Square / Soho etc, but close enough to walk to it within 15/20 mins. The walk is good anyway as you pass the London Eye, Parliament, Big Ben, Whitehall, Trafalgar Sq etcThe rooms are of a normal size, and beds are really comfortable, as well as the bathroom has bath and seperate shower (very modern)"
49,1038,"Jun 2 2009 	Loved the view towards river Thames	I was on a business trip to London and I stayed for about 50 days at the Park Plaza Riverbank. Mine was a room with a window facing towards River Thames and a clear glimpse of the BIG BEN!! It was so amazing to take a walk at evening along the bank of the river!The room services were extremely efficient and the ambiance was very attractive. Also the lounge experience was fantastic.In terms of connectivity to the nearest tube stations, a bus stop is just outside the main entrance of the hotel. Waterloo station is about 15 mins by bus.Talking of local attractions, London Eye and Big Ben are about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. It was my first visit to London and it would have been a very different experience if I had not stayed in Park Plaza. One of the closest memories that I am going to cherish all my life."

51,1038,"May 18 2009 	great weekend	Hotel and staff really nice,made my first time in london extra special."
52,1038,"May 18 2009 	Good location for a Weekend stay	We stayed at the hotel for one night on 16th May 2009. We haid paid for the upgrade to an executive room for an extra 30. I would say that it was worth the money, but only just. You are promised fruit on arrival, a robe, slippers and a choice of pillow. In reality the fruit was an orange, an apple and a plum. We only had one robe, one pair of slippers and when we ordered a luxury pillow we were told that they did not have any!! Be careful as they promise free internet, but this is not through the TV in room you have to bring your own laptop. The room was very clean with nice fixtures and fittings. It had a great bathroom and a decent sized flatscreen. The use of the executive suite was also part of the package which provided free drinks between 6.30 and 8.30pm. This was a quiet bar on the 11th floor and was ideal to sit and enjoy a few drinks before going out. We also had breakfast in the Chino Latino restaurant which was nice as you did not have to queue. The breakfast was of a good standard although it was self service. The major problem for us was the temperature in the room. It was very warm. We were told that the air conditioning units had not been turned on so I hope they sort this soon. I would reccomend this hotel as our overall experience was good. The location is excellent as within a ten minute walk you are at the London Eye."
53,1038,May 14 2009 	Worst reception staff ever!!!	NOT RECOMMENDED FOR BUSINESS PEOPLE AT ALL. SLOWEST CHECKIN i have ever had. When i arrived to the hotel just after 2.30 pm I was told by the receptionist in a rude german accent that room is not ready and leave your luggage at concierge and come back later or we will call you if you want when your room is ready. I mean what the hell??? why are you advertising 2pm checkin then ???I was helpless and had to attend a meeting so had to go. When i finally came back at 5 pm to checkin at the desk another snobbish german receptionist told me that my handwriting was bad and tore the registration form and gave me a new one and asked to fill it again neatly. i mean rediculous when i asked why did she tear away the form i had already signed she mentioned that it is as per our manager we need to make sure that all forms are filled clearly in a good handwriting. I was like is this receptionst about to teach me calligraphy or is behaving like my school teacher teaching me to write clearly??? not acceptable at all. And then the next thing i was asked to fill in was my email address as a mandatory requirement apparently as per the manager to checkin. to what i said i dont have one just to avoid those junk mails these guys send as promotional marketing and i was told its not possible you dont have one?i can just go on and on anyway this was just the beginning of my stay so dont even ask about the rest and on the checkout i was not even asked how my stay was or any thing no basic manners at all and no customer service. the whole staff there including the manager needs to learn some english hospitality and culture and a thorough customer service training. not recommended!!!!
54,1038,"Apr 29 2009 	We'd stay here again	Nice rooms, nice restaurant (kind of an Asian fusion), pretty good location on the riverbank at the Thames. You can walk if the weather permits to Buckingham Palace, and Piccadilly Circus. If you buy their exclusive premium (whatever it's called) the breakfast is pretty good and the evening beer/wine/snacks are too, I'd recommend it if it's in your budget.The service at the lounge can be a bit spotty (and I'm probably being kind). Also, they've got a little cafe in the basement with hours that didn't really make sense to me.Lots of jazz/smooth music throughout the lobby and restaurant/lounge which I like. There's one computer for internet in the lobby, kind of hidden close to the elevators which came in handy.Hey, I'd stay here again!"
55,1038,"Apr 27 2009 	The usual good Park Plaza standards	After arriving back into the the UK from a trip in Paris we opted to stay in london for one night. We book the hotel through there own website was a bit more expensive but i was short on time on the internet access in Paris. We got a good rate for a no cancelation fee. of 130 for one night, for a 4 star slap bang on the thames i didn't think seemed to bad. On arrival at St Pancras station we got the tube to the closest station it said on there website, Vauxhall station, 10minutes walk which isn't bad but we had a lot of cases and seemed an eternity till we arrived. When we arrived at the hotel our bags were taken when checking in which then i was charged for my room not when i booked it like i thought, no worries but it didn't state that.We had been upgraded to a River view room, same room as we book but just with a view. The room was very spacious, Clean and well maintained.The Views it offered were excellent even though it was lashing it down outside.The bathroom was Massive, Bath and a shower.The extra you get from these rooms are as follows (off there official website) :-Executive Rooms with river view and Suites at our London lodging feature the following additional amenities:Bose CD/DVD playerComplimentary morning newspaperExclusive access to the Executive LoungeFruit and water on arrival Luxury bathrobe and slippersOne hour complimentary in-room Internet accessPlasma screen TV with surround soundTwo telephonesUpgraded bathroom amenitiesYour choice of pillowWhich was a definite plus as it was free.It was a bit of a walk (15-20minutes) up to the London eye but that was only thing that i could find fault with.I didn't get to try the restaurant that was located in the hotel so i can't really comment.Would i return....??For a one night break in london defiantly. For a longer stay in london, if i got a good deal i would."
56,1038,Apr 23 2009 	Excellent location!	The first thing that strikes you is the location of the hotel..It is on the Albert embankment on Thames just across the westminster parliament.. Also a stone's throw from London eye and waterloo stationTry getting the rooms that are facing the riverOne thing in which the hotel can be better is in internet access. There is NO free internet. This can turn off business usersBut overall a nice place to be!
57,1038,"Apr 21 2009 	the best week end away ever	Stayed in this fab hotel for two nights ,as our son was taking part in changing of the guard at buckingham palace..Prime location to all tourist spots.We took a taxi to oxford st, and walked very easily to regent st, leicester square,picadilly circus,trafalgar square, whitehall,parliament st, and westminster,then we walked along waterloo pier where the london eye is and there was an array of street performers and buzzing with tourists etc,loved it ,by10 o clock we walked back to hotel amazed at what we d covered in 1 day!! get a map from reception ,as we did ,theyre free too ! this is a must to getting around yourself and an experience we ll never forget.theres a mini supermarket right next to the hotel for any essentials also,taxi fares can be cheaper than tube as we found out,and quicker.Going back home the victoria line was out of use ,so get a bus from vauxhall to victoria station then tube on the circle line ,which takes about 15 to 20 mins to kings cross."
58,1038,Apr 14 2009 	Huge wonderful rooms! Great location!	This was a great hotel! The staff was wonderful and very helpful. The location is hard to beat...right across the river from Westminster and Big Ben! The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Only draw back was it's about a 10 min walk to an Underground station.
59,1038,"Apr 14 2009 	An affordable modern Park Plaza but a little out of the way	For those of us who live in Euroland, London is as cheap as it has ever been. Now's the time to go! When booking, I was delighted to find a truly affordable room at the Park Plaza Riverbank. To me, &quot;Park Plaza&quot; has always been an upscale brand. And this would be my first experience with this chain. I suppose my impression of this hotel is based somewhat on the expectation that we would be getting a luxury experience.The hotel is located just south of Lambeth Bridge and Lambeth Palace, on the south side of the Thames. The hotel is on a nondescript stretch of Albert Embankment lying between Lambeth and Vauxhall. The hotel is sandwiched between the Thames and the wide multiple-track railway line leading into Waterloo. Vauxhall tube station is about a 5-10 minute walk south. Going north it takes about 10-15 minutes to walk to Westminster Bridge (London Eye, Parliament, etc.). The closest tube station up this way is Waterloo. Vauxhall is the closest tube stop. It's walkable for most people with moderately light bags.The hotel makes a nice first impression, as you might expect from a Park Plaza. Intriguing art in the lobby. The reception was efficient enough. This is a modern, well furnished hotel of about 10 storeys. The room we got was modern, upscale and very clean, but not a &quot;wow&quot; kind of room. Flatscreen TV. Lots of closet space. The designer bathroom with black tiles was spacious and modern. Here was a bit of luxury.This hotel is roughly in the shape of a hollow hexagon. Of the six sides, it seems that only one or two sides face NW toward Parliament and have the spectacular views of Parliament. If I remember correctly, these were the rooms on each floor ending in -41, -43, -45 and -47. The doors on this side look better than those for the rest of the hotel. Clearly these are the nicer rooms.I didn't see the view from these rooms or the rooms on the other side, but from what I could see most of the outside rooms on the other sides did not have views. We had a room on the inside (an even numbered room). These rooms are supposedly quieter because they look onto the courtyard in the middle of the hotel. But this courtyard is rather small and the other rooms are not far way. The view we had was of other rooms, and they had a similar view of our room. I can't remember every staying in a hotel (of any quality) where I could actually see the other guests lying in bed. We ended up having to keep our drapes closed much of the time. If you value privacy, try not to get one of these courtyard rooms. I really value my privacy, so this detracted seriously from the enjoyment of the hotel. I should have said something immediately, but it took a day or two before it really started bothering me.Before long I understood why we got such a good deal on this room. The really great rooms with the views (the &quot;executive rooms&quot; or whatever they call them) are not going at these prices. It's the rooms on the other sides (without great views; not so quiet) or the courtyard rooms (lacking privacy) that are going at these great prices.This is a hotel that is designed to make the best of a strange location. It tries to be two things at once: a very upscale hotel offering great rooms for those willing to pay; combined with a standard hotel with rather problematic rooms for the rest.This dual mission is reinforced by the two breakfasts on offer. The spacious breakfast place in the Chino restaurant was empty and had salmon on offer. Needless to say, the punctilious Polish youth shooed me away from his little empire. I was to dine with the rest of the plebes in the overcrowded basement. And here they served a delicious, competent breakfast. They had the usual things you would expect at a breakfast buffet. Scrambled eggs were laid out in the buffet, but a sign said that you could ask for other eggs if you wanted it. The sausages were delicious. It was not a luxury breakfast and it was not extraordinary. Sorry to the nice people there who really provided great service, but I'm calling it as I see it. It was not the kind of breakfast I expected to get at a Park Plaza.London was absolutely packed with tourists. You couldn't really get away from it. Unfortunately we weren't the only ones with the bright idea of taking advantage of the cheap pound. Or is London always like this on a holiday weekend?This also applied to this hotel. Italians in particular seemed to be travelling in large groups of families and young people, and couldn't stop nattering excitedly, even at breakfast. After a while it got to me. It all became too slick, too international, for me. There seemed to be no British people around. Not the staff. Not the guests. It was not a quiet, upscale crowd, which is sort of what I expected at a Park Plaza. By the end, it didn't feel like a London hotel. Or even like London. However, as I said, it was tourist hell the weekend we were there. Perhaps it was like this in every hotel.There's not much in the immediate area of the Park Plaza Riverbank. A few restaurants towards Vauxhall. (And a few gay places I think.) Thankfully there is a wonderful, fully supplied corner shop about 25 metres away from the hotel. I've been to London many, many times before, and I see now that I prefer to stay somewhere that gives me easy access to some London street life, pubs, shops, restaurants, the tube, etc. This hotel doesn't really have that. As close as it is to Westminster Bridge, this hotel felt sort of isolated. There is not an awful lot in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. Getting anywhere required a walk or a bus trip. A few quick points about the hotel amenities. The bar was huge and the Chino restaurant offered an intriguing pasta buffet for 8.50, although we didn't personally enjoy either. The internet is free. It's fast too, especially in the business centre in the basement. There is no pool, no sauna, no wellness area. The gym on the 5th floor has about 8-10 modern-looking cardio machines of various kinds. No weights and no weight-training machines at all.The staff here were clearly professionally trained and provided great service. I must say there was a problem with minibar items and breakfasts wrongly added to my account, but you see that kind of thing everywhere. I'm giving this place 4/5 mainly because of the price-quality ratio. What else can I say about this place? It is a very proper hotel - a Park Plaza no less - offering comfortable rooms at a great price. That's not always easy to find in London. If you're just looking for an affordable, modern hotel somewhere in London, this might be the right place for you. I would pay particular attention to the room you get. You may need to switch rooms a few times until you find something suitably quiet and private. I am also sure that the atmosphere of this hotel probably changes completely during the week. I saw it on a busy holiday weekend."
60,1038,"Mar 23 2009 	Park Plaza Riverbank - worth a look	We stayed here for a weekend and thought that overall it represented good value for money. We travelled to London by train and used the Victoria Line to Vauxhall which was about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. We had booked using a promotion through Travel Zoo which was offering a standard room including breakfast for 79 per night or an executive room for 99 per night again including breakfast. We chose the executive package as it was our wedding anniversary and when we arrived at the hotel on Friday afternoon we were pleased with the quality of the room. It was reasonably large by London standards, very modern and contemporary, with a great bathroom which included a bath as well as a walk in shower. Sadly we didnt have a river view but equally we had not paid for one! We overlooked other rooms at the side of the hotel but that was no problem as its not like you have a balcony to chill on, so you dont really look out of the window. I was just pleased that we didnt overlook the railway line but I did wonder if maybe thats where the standard rooms were. We unpacked and left the hotel for a walk as it was a beautiful day. We only got as far as the boat bar directly over the road on the Thames embankment, where we enjoyed a glass of wine on the deck, looking at the view of the houses of Parliament and the London Eye. While we were enjoying this, it occurred to me that our room had none of the executive extras I had seen on the Website, which wouldnt have mattered if we hadnt deliberately made the choice and paid the extra 20 per night. I did wonder if this had something to do with the fact that we had got a promotional rate but I still wanted to know what we had paid the extra 40 for. After we had finished our drinks we went back over to the hotel and I spoke to a guy at the Guest Relations desk. He looked up our room number and apologised and said he would sort it out and reminded us that we also had use of the executive lounge between 6.30pm and 8.30pm for complimentary drinks and snacks. I was then feeling very pleased that we had queried it. We then left the hotel again and took a five minute walk up the road towards Vauxhall station to a pub called the Rose where we had another drink and a meal. We returned to the hotel around 6pm and in our room was a tray with fruit, water and toiletries and on the bed were our bathrobes and slippers. Making the assumption that the standard rooms are overlooking the railway lines at the rear of the hotel then I felt that the extra 20 was worth paying. We then made our way to the executive lounge on the 11th floor where we had a couple of drinks each (wine and beer) There were some snacks, spring rolls etc but as we had not long eaten we did not have any. We then returned to our room to enjoy the champagne we had brought with us. We had requested at check in some champagne glasses and an ice bucket and these had been brought to our room earlier. There is an ice station on each floor so we were able to replenish the ice. There is a mini bar in the room and there is a small space in there for your own items - as with most mini bars if you remove any items you will be charged, regardless of whether or not you actually used them. The next morning we went down to the club lounge (level minus 1) for breakfast as instructed when we checked in. However when they looked up our room number we were told that as we were executive guests our breakfast was in the Chino Latino restaurant on the ground floor. Couldnt fault the breakfast there, lovely surroundings, massive choice of cereals, fruits, yogurts, continental breakfast and of course the good old full English. No queuing and all the cooked items were hot. Left the hotel around 10.30am and wandered up to the London Eye which we had booked a ride on - about 20 minutes slow stroll along the embankment. Spent the rest of the day in Covent Garden and Leicester square before going to see Thriller Live. Had dinner in Piccadilly Circus and returned to the hotel around 9.00pm. Whilst out we noticed signs informing that the entire Victoria Line was closed for the whole weekend which meant that we had to travel back to Waterloo and walk from there - about 20 mins with aching feet after a day out - but hey I am still alive! Also we realised that this meant we would have to catch the train from Waterloo in the morning to get back to Kings Cross as the Victoria Line was not running at Vauxhall. A bit of a pain but not a major incident. Sunday Morning -another lovely breakfast in Chino Latinos, took the complimentary Sunday papers back to the room for a read and then checked out around 11.00am.To sum up, this hotel suited us perfectly, we thought it was in a good location for what we wanted from the weekend. If the Victoria Line is running it is only a 10 min walk and even if not, its a max 20mins to Waterloo with a lovely walk down the embankment overlooking the House of Parliament and Big Ben etc so really no major hassle. We didnt use the hotel bar but I expect like any hotel it would have been expensive, however there are plenty of options outside of the hotel so you make your own choice about that. Our deal also included 50% off dining in Chino Latinos so that was probably quite affordable - however we didnt fancy it so we didnt bother. I would definitely return here or to one of the other Park Plazas in the vicinity as I feel it represented good value for money."
61,1038,"Feb 26 2009 	Spoilt by one event	Have stayed at this hotel before, and think it is very well priced, and the location whilst not perfect is fairly handy. It is a shame that on this occasion we had some poor service which has somewhat coloured my judgement. Despite reporting and requesting that our rooms hadnt been made up (by 4pm) and that the air con wasnt working, they still hadnt been made up when we got back from the theatre at 11pm. The answer to the air con not working was to open a window. Despite that it is a good hotel, and for the price I paid exceptional value. Book via park plaza website for best deals 9not all that much more than a Travellodge!). The beds are very comfy and the rooms well appointed."
62,1038,Feb 24 2009 	liked the sentral location	its an excellent hotel my third time to London since millenium and my experience with Riverbank park plaza is the far best. It was a bit more expencieve than my earlier stay but worth every penny. CLEANLOCATIONNEW HOTELFairly spaciousNice Reception
63,1038,Feb 18 2009 	Great Hotel	Stayed for two nights in February. Hotel was very clean and rooms spacious. Great bathroom with separate shower and bath. Beds were comfortable and there was plenty selection at the Breakfast Buffet. Staff were helpful and friendly. Short walk to Vauxhall Tube station - Lambeth Walk exit and walk about 5 - 10 mins along the road at the same side. There is an exit for Albert Embankment but it is the other side of the road. London Eye etc are about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Eating places are limited within the location of the hotel and the hotel prices are quite expensive. Free internet access in the rooms. The downside is the music - if you are on a lower floor this goes on until around 3.30am and the music for the breakfast room which is not loud in the breakfast room but can be heard in the rooms on the lower floor. Rooms at back o f the hotel have no views other than other rooms.
64,1038,Feb 12 2009 	It is value for money.	It was pleasent experiance with THAMES RIVER &amp; LONDON TOWER view.
65,1038,"Jan 20 2009 	Lovely Hotel but ended up being a nightmare	Arrived on New Years Eve, 11.00am booked in knowing our room wouldn't be ready came back 6.30pm to find room still not ready. Went to the bar for free drinks and waited 1 hour till room was ready. Meanwhile our friends checked in and the hotel had lost their booking. The receptionist went off to find a manager who wasn't available. She came back and my friend went round the desk and looked at the computer and his name was there all the time with the booking reference number that he had given her. One hour later they got to their room.We went up to our room, rang housekeeping to ask for the bed for our son to be made up. It was a lovely large room but very cold. We all went to the Lounge for something to eat and had a lovely meal, with great coctails. Off we went to the New Years fireworks. Leaving our 16 year old daughter to get an early night because she was tired and had A Level exams early Jan. The fireworks were great. came back to find our daughter distressed because of extremely loud music coming from the disco below her room. Rang reception, asked to be moved, told the Hotel was full. The music finally stopped at 3.30am. On the booking form I had asked for a quiet room so there was no excuse. Got back to our room to find bed has not been made up it was eventually done at 2.00am. Got to bed but one of the lights wouldn't turn off. Rang reception again. They came up but said there was nothing they could do. I slept fully dressed because heating wasn't working. I never did get warm this was probably the worst thing of the time.I complained to the manager and we were moved to a beautiful suite with view of Thames but once again the heating wasn't working. They quickly brought us radiators which were great. The views from the room were amazing. I also managed to negotiate some money off the bill.So all in all it was a nightmare, one can put up with one or two problems because it was the busiest night of the year. But this was just too much."
66,1038,"Jan 19 2009 	A lovely experience	Although the room (831) was a little warm for our liking (I can't believe I am moaning about being too warm in a cold January!) and the washbasin was a little slow in emptying, these were just minor points in a very enjoyable weekend. Lovely clean hotel, nice rooms and, their biggest asset, staff which really do go out of their way to be be pleasant, helpful and cheerful. They really made our stay a memorable one."
67,1038,"Jan 12 2009 	Fantastic Hotel	We stayed in this hotel having seen a fantastic January offer on Travelzoo. Southbank is not normally the area we would stay, but the price was great and included breakfast. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk to Vauxhall tube station. The rooms are spacious, modern and very clean. The staff were all very friendly. The hotel bar was lively when we returned to the hotel at about midnight. It's a modern bar and certainly worth a visit to relax after sightseeing. The breakfast is a buffet style breakfast, with a good choice of breakfast items."
68,1038,"Jan 7 2009 	Great value high class hotel	My wife and a friend stayed here in December for one night as part of a Theatre break. Hotels in central London were completely out of our price range, so it was good to find this one reasonably priced and only a short tube ride into town.The hotel is 5 minutes walk from Vauxhall tube (10/15 minutes from Waterloo - but a nice walk along the river). It is a modern property, and clean and well-appointed. The rooms were bright and clean - as were the bathrooms. Rooms were of a good size with an excellent entertainment system, including pay-as-you-go internet. The bar was excellent too- and the bar food wonderful (and not expensive). Quite why anyone would actually need to use the restaurant was beyond us!One small thing - the hotel is near a busy railway line, so if you are easily disturbed, ask for a room at the front of the hotel (you'll probably get a nice view too (I dont know if they cost more though).All in all, we were really glad we found this place. we've stayed in the big central London hotels before and found them to be over-priced and not up to much. The Park Plaza Riverside is somewhere we will definitely return to."
69,1038,"Jan 6 2009 	Not As impressed As Last Time	We arrived after a 3 hour, freezing train delay and I was looking forward to hot relaxing bath. Upon arrival I was advised I had booked a twin room instead of a double, which I accept was my fault. However they only had the one room available with a double bed apparently, which turned out to be a disabled room. I have nothing against this but there was no bath and the room was smaller (Having stayed here before I knew what to expect)Another problem was the no heating in the bathroom.. On a weekend where the temperatures where as low as -6 in a completely tiled room was not pleasent at all any time of day.Room service food arrived barely warm and was not very nice compared to eating in the restaurant donwstairs.Good points where the reduced noise from the trains. Dont know how they have improved this but we were again at the back of the hotel but this time no noise at all from the trains passing :)With the cold weather we had a number of lay-ins. Not enabling the room to be cleaned at the normal times. After leaving the room after 3PM on all three days we arrived back late at night to find the room was spotless, beds made, clean towels etc Which I was very impressed with.The hotel is still as smart and clean the staff are helpfull and I would stay here again as I know im partly to blame for the room.N.B Do not waste 5 a day on the built in internet on the TV! There is a computer in the reception you can use for free.. Slightly Hidden. Just ask them where it is if you cant find it."
70,1038,Jan 3 2009	Large rooms	The room was much bigger than expected and compared to other london hotels I have stayed at. The front desk was only able to give me a double room in the disabled floor which meant no tub but it was fine. The water pressure in the room was weak and the hot water was not very hot but overall the experience was good. The heater worked well and the hotel was only a 10 minute walk from Vauxhall tube station.
71,1038,"Jan 3 2009 	Great hotel	We stayed here for our 6 year aniversary got a great deal through the website , exec room with river view including breakfast and 50% off hotel restaurant.Upon checkin we were advised the room wasn't yet available but we were delighted to be upgraded to a suite. We left our bags and went off shopping arrived back to a beautiful suite.We went to the club lounge for evening drinks and canape. Only wine and soft drinks, a little dissapointing.We had booked dinner in the hotel restuarant so made our way up. We handed them the 50% voucher and were seated. 2 mins later the waiter came over to advise the voucher had expired. I told him thats odd we had only checked in. He sorted it out. The food was amazing , I think I had the duck it was really nice and their cocktails were delicious I recommend the Mohito.After food we got the bill but noticed the 50% was not taken off again we had to advise the waitress. she was very appologetic and immediately ammended it. Even with the 50% it was a little expensive but worth it , I would not have paid full price.The only other little niggles were I was told they didn't have any other pillow other than feather , which i'm alergic too. I told them I found that hard to believe. Eventually after numerious calls they brought a foam pillow up.You can have breakfast in chino's if you have an exec package however they didn't have us on there list so I had to sort it out with frount desk who again were appologetic for not correctly advising the restuarant.Service was extremly slow had to wait 30mins for toast e.t.c but food was good.So in summary a very nice hotel , spend extra to get an exec room with a view it is worth it. Service was poor. I can accept one mistake but numerious ones means lack of service becareful make sure you get everything with the package you booked something which Hotel guests should not have to highlight. Still though a great hotel!"
72,1038,"Jan 3 2009 	Loved the Park Plaza - Excellent Location	Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in Nov-Dec 2008, loved it. Great location, could walk to everything and view over the Thames was worth the cost. Would stay here again"
73,1038,"Dec 31 2008 	Certainly very nice hotel to stay in	I do stay in this hotel on regular basis as it is close to our London office.Positive things:-Very good rooms and they all are exactly the same, therefore no &quot;room lottery&quot;-Good beds with very-very soft pillows-Always very clean-Staff are very polite-Good breakfast (haven't tried the restaurant)-River view (expensive rooms)-Quiet (compared to many other London hotels)-Large TV with many channels-Free WiFi internet -Nice big bathroom-Everything is modern and in good conditionNegative things:-A bit far away from local points of interest, so it is always a taxi ride or long walk-When they give you cheap room with a river view, you will have 10% river view and 90% railway view. So don;t bother with river view, get inner court view, this is quieter-Once I asked for my shirts to be pressed - and had to iron them myself once they came back. Do not use that service - they can ruin your shirtsOverall, my proffered hotel in London at the moment - I would stay there for the business as well as private trips"
74,1038,"Dec 28 2008 	Nice place to stay	It's all good here: everything smart and new, especially for the fairly reasonable rates usually available. The breakfasts and the cocktails are much better than most. Apart from the river, little to see or do within 10 minutes walk - but hang on... within 20 minutes you have absolutely everything: Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly Circus, London Eye, Shakespeare's Globe, Tate Britain &amp; Modern. No tube stations within close walking distance (Vauxhall about 10 minutes) but buses stop right outside the door every five minutes night and day.In winter the air-con's switched off - which sounds fair enough unless the room's constantly too hot (at least 25 degrees C I reckon). Bathrooms rather tiny but at least a proper tub and separate shower. A perfect choice if you're into the modern/minimalist look and can find a decent rate (less than about 150 a night would make it a good buy compared with others in London)."
75,1038,"Dec 12 2008 	Much commendable one glaring black mark	The location, staff, food and accommodations at the Riverbank are mostly commendable, with poise and aplomb openly displayed in a friendly manner.I counsel being careful to ascertain the location of your room, as the rear is just above the railway and our room window in 2006 was on a central air shaft, facing other rooms.Breakfast was provided, and the buffet was nearly sumptuous and was well-tended. The un-muffled din, small tables and uncomfortable seating were the only weak points.The one thing I cannot get past, in stark contrast, is the clearly immature and obviously un- or under-supervised Concierge desk, staffed by inattentive, adolescent boys. They turned away 3 attempted deliveries to me because my name (which I gave him twice, in advance) is not the same as my wife's, under whom the room was registerd. The attitude displayed, on each incidence, was surprisingly undisciplined and dismissive.Otherwise, the service, ambience and amenities are superior. However, due to my impression of lack of competence at the Concierge desk, I would not recommend staying there."
76,1038,"Dec 9 2008 	Loved that Hotel	We stayed here with my husband for one night.....it was our first time in England...and we loved that Hotel.....Reception area is beautiful as well as bar...it is very romantic there during the evening time...We didnt try food there, but cocktails theyve made -Mmmmm!!!!!Staff is very helpful, the gave us a late check out next day, as our flight wasnt till 20.00..Room was nice, comfy beds. It was back facing room, so it was very quite....We suppose to have a bottle of wine on arrival, but there was none in the room when we checked in, I ask receptionist, and it was sorted quickly.We really enjoy our stay there and we will definitely come back to this Hotel...."
77,1038,"Nov 19 2008 	Great styling but a little noisy	We stayed one night in a standard room at The Park Plaza as we were attending a function at the hotel on Saturday night. We parked in the hotel car park which is small and under the railway bridge a short walk from the hotel and we were slightly concerned about security but it seemed to be well fenced and fairly secure.Having read the reviews I made a point of asking the reception desk if we could have a room away from the trains - the receptionist went to enquire with a colleague and said she would see what she could do. We ended up being towards the rear of the hotel on the 7th floor so were still quite close to the trains - so not hugely impressed with the reception desk, although I was impressed with the soundproofing and after consideration we decided not to ask to change rooms. The room itself was large and well furnished and spotless. The bathroom was nicely appointed and again very clean. We had no view from our room other than of another building and the train line. The bed was very comfy and lovely and warm. My husband said he could hear the lift going up and down in the night (even though we were well away from it) and we could hear the trains but it didn't stop me getting a good nights sleep and I am quite a light sleeper.I would stay at the hotel again if we were attending another function there but otherwise I would try and find somewhere a bit more central in a quieter location."
78,1038,"Nov 18 2008 	very relaxing	Stayed here for 2 nights, very much enjoyed our stay, the room was modern and very clean. There was an iron burn on the carpet and the room was quite small. Breakfast was very nice and well cooked. Drinks were expensive but thats London for you! Staff were very good and obviously well trained. Happy weekend!"
79,1038,"Nov 10 2008 	Good Location Big Rooms Brilliant Food!	The hotel isn't in the best location for the tube, but there are plenty of buses about. The rooms are big, with strange orange lighting (which you can turn off), clean and comfy. The staff are all friendly. The noise of the trains in the back rooms is muffled but audible so if you're a light sleeper take ear plugs. The restaurant is one of the best in Europe, if you can afford it, but if not the Club Lounge food is fantastic although the service is a bit slow."
80,1038,"Oct 19 2008 	Fanfastic stay	My wife and I have just come back from a weekend stay at the hotel. When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly staff and were immediately informed that we had been upgraded to their 5 star accommodation at no extra cost. The room was'nt quite ready for us so to compensate for the inconvenience, (which was minimal), we were given free drinks in the bar. The suite we were given was beyond our expectations, it was more like a fully equipped apartment, immaculately clean &amp; modern. Its worth mentioning the nice little touches that added to being made to feel important, such as after coming back at the end of the day to find the bed made down, music playing in your room &amp; chocolates on the pillow to welcome you.To summarise, a great hotel &amp; staff, a great location &amp; great value, a real find. Desperately trying to find an excuse to stay again.Mr &amp; Mrs Crayford,"
81,1038,"Oct 15 2008 	A poor cooked breakfast at the end of a sleepless night	Nice public areas and a friendly concierge and a smart looking room were all a good start. The room was at the back of the hotel.There was an annoying low level extractor hum coming from somewhere which was mildly annoying when I went to bed at two, however the trains traveling past were unbearable. They were very audible and from six it was constant roar for rush hour. The net result was I had next to no sleep. Breakfast was uninspiring but the cooked breakfast was inedible. The only bad cooked breakfast I can ever remember anywhere.In my opinion this hotel fails in the most basic requirement of a hotel, i.e. you can't get a nights sleep in the place. If you can't get a room on the front away and from the lifts avoid this place, otherwise it should be fine I imagine"
82,1038,"Oct 4 2008 	Nothing special at all!	The hotel was extremely average. Our room felt like it hadn't been cleaned properly, there was an iron burn on the carpet and there were no little extras to the room at all - just the usual tea making facilities (not even any biscuits). The room was tired and in need of some TLC, when using the toilet roll, the holder fell off the wall.The positives were that the room was large in terms of London standards, the staff were pleasant and it was a lovely walk along the Thames to the Millenium Wheel on the sunny Sunday morning - of course the weather can't be guaranteed ;) We are a young couple who used the room as a base so it did for us but if you want something special, go somewhere else."
83,1038,"Oct 2 2008 	Becoming a favourite.	I have stayed at the Riverbank on a number of occasions and can recommend it. A large modern hotel, the rooms are excellent - larger than most London hotel rooms and with large bathrooms. Very well equipped (including DVD player) and some rooms have great views. Breakfast is comprehensive though the cooked version can be a bit lacking in freshness if it has been on the hotplate too long. You will need a large bank loan if you want anything from the mini-bar so I recommend the little shop almost next door which stays open until 11.00 and stocks most things.The only real disadvantage for many people is the location - it is a fair distance from the nearest tube and there are only a limited range of eating places in the immediate vicinity."
84,1038,"Sep 26 2008 	Good location fulfills all needs	We stayed here before leaving on a cruise. We arrived early and the staff was helpful in finding us a room that was available early on a Friday afternoon. It's very centrally located, we walked to the Houses of Parlament for a late afternoon tour, then found dinner. There were a number of nearby bars, one of which we visited later in the evening and met a number of people leaving on the same cruise the next day.This was my 3rd time to London, both by location and service this is the best place I've stayed. I would certainly stay there again."
85,1038,"Sep 26 2008 	Uninspiring...	I recently stayed at the Park Plaza Riverbank for two nights with my partner; we were in London celebrating our anniversary and so booked an 'Executive' room for two nights.The hotel promised much and was in a good location.However, the experience was utterly uninspiring: this hotel really is nothing special. What's more, there were a series of niggles and minor irritations which somewhat spoiled the occasion.The most blatant error was that our sheets were not cleaned after the first night. We returned from the city to find that the room itself had been cleaned, and fresh towels provided, but that no-one had seen fit to change the bedding.I've stayed in pokey hotels and apartments for less than 50 per night where the sheets were changed daily with metronomic precision; so why not, when I paid over 200 per night?Also annoying was the 'Executive' package itself - and the associated promotions.We were supposed to have been able to access the Executive lounge, with drinks and canapes included, which would have been nice, as the view from our room was of the walls of an apartment block (presumably) and a dirty side street...But we couldn't get in.Nobody picked up the phone when I called to query this; then, when we asked at reception, they informed us that drinks were to be served instead in the bar.The bar staff knew nothing of this and we left quite disappointed.Breakfast was also quite dismal - and similarly confusing. (It is served in three different places and we were shuffled between them all.) And, although we sat down towards the end of the allotted slot for breakfast, the staff seemed to actively want to get rid of us.The overall package - comfort, quality, service, etc. - was average (at best) and what I would expect for about a third of the price. For an outlay of 420 (for two nights), I expected a lot more.Definitely not recommended!"
86,1038,"Sep 23 2008 	Well worth a try	I booked the hotel through lastminute.com (one of their mystery hotels) for 300 (Thu &amp; Fri) in an executive room. Given that the rate includes a full breakfast and free drinks &amp; snacks between 6.00 &amp; 8.00 pm it was a bit of a bargain. We had a (very) partial river view room on the 10th floor which was very quiet. They wouldn't upgrade me to a river view room, even when I offerred to pay the difference in price (very odd).The hotel is quite new so all furnishings are immaculate. The design of the bedroom, the quality of the bed and en-suite are all first class. The aircon is effective but noisy on any setting.The executive lounge was closed and so drinks/snacks were served in the basement club lounge - the other half of which was full of coach-party guests - not very conducive for a quiet drink.Breakfast for non-executive room guests in the Club room looked pretty horrendous; breakfast in Chino restaurant was much better, but the tables would be much too close together for dinner.Check in / check out was efficient. Be careful when you ask the concierge to call a taxi though; make sure you get a real black cab. The porters appear to have an arrangment with a firm of unmetred minicabs that lie in wait outside the entrance. They take your bags to one of these guys, who, when you get to your destination, proceed to demand double the normal taxi fare. Beware.Mangement should put a stop to this scam."
87,1038,"Sep 19 2008 	Room for improvement	Hotel is in prime location , adjacent to the Thames . Rooms at the front have excellent views of Houses of Parliament , rooms at the rear are next to a railway line and have terrible views of industrial areas . Many of the young staff are foreign and their command of english is not always good . Bar was understaffed and they were rushing about , which does not create a relaxed atmosphere . The continental breakfast was far better than the full english , which included tinned mushrooms , watery scrambled eggs and bacon rashers that appeared to be boiled . Overall disappointing for a hotel of this class ."
88,1038,"Sep 15 2008 	Not what I expected	After staying one night nearby in a Premier Inn for 68 we thought we would splash out and stay in a luxury hotel for a night. Ok, so we booked through a London discount hotel website, but when we turned up, the desk said they did not have my reservation entered on their system. Luckily I had a printout of my reservation so they grudgingly gave us a room while they checked it out. The receptionist refused to believe that we were entitled to breakfast and said we were room only.Eventually, after about half an hour, they found our booking and agreed that we were indeed having breakfast.The room was beautiful, although it was at the back of the hotel overlooking the main railway line (approx 25 yards away) into Waterloo. In spite of the triple glazing the sound of trains could be heard all through the night. Breakfast was good.So - lovely hotel but ask for a room at the front overlooking the river. It will set you back a lot more but at least you'll get some sleep."
89,1038,Sep 15 2008 	Good for business traveller	I frequently visit London and I think this hotel is one of the best hotels for business travellers. I have stayed here twice and I like the location and modern facilities.RemziTurkey
90,1038,"Sep 4 2008	Just not as good as it could be	I stayed here for a night on business, and everything about the hotel isn't quite as good as it might be; the receptionists were too busy to attend to guests when I checked in; the room - which was great - had a sheen of dirt on every surface, cigarette ash on the floor (in a non-smoking room), drink stains on the furniture; housekeeping came barging in without knocking 3 times in as many hours; the room key had been disabled when I returned in the evening; the 4 bar staff were too locked in conversation to actually serve the guests... All little niggles but a surefire sign that someone needs to fire a rocket up the management before standards slip really badly."
91,1038,"Sep 3 2008 	Great stay... no buts	Stayed here for two night... was upgraded to riverview without request... simply stunning. Staff was helpfull and professional at all times. One of the most stylish, and cutting edge hotels in London... Chino latino restaurant highly recomended, one of the best dining experiences in a long time (bring cash).This has been my fourth stay, (on one occasion Amy Winehouse was also a guest at that time, altough not much was seen of her) and each time this hotel has surpassed my standards, truly worth the premium..."
92,1038,"Aug 26 2008 	Very Clean and Modern Hotel at Good Location	I just got back from a 1 week stay at this hotel and I was pleasently surprised by this modern, clean, quiet and friendly staffed hotel. I highly would recommend staying at this hotel and it's worth the extra few $$. The location was very convenient to everything...tube, busses, Eye, Big Ben and there was a small convenient store next door to the hotel which was not over priced and was great for picking up snacks and bottled water. Cash station is right next door to the hotel as well. Telephone booth in front of the hotel. A pub and few other restaurants were located about a block down as well. Recommend the Portugese restaurant, good food. Just don't be surprised but there is a male Gay bar as you go towards Vauxhal Station but it didn't seem to be happening until after 10pm. Did not know it even existed until walking back to the hotel from the tube one night. The rooms are a bit small but the bathroom was great....very big and very clean. It had a separate tub and shower and plenty of counter space. We got the breakfast package as well and the buffet every morning was properly served...no matter what time we went down to eat they always had plenty of food and the service was top notch. The wait staff was alert and polite and quickly responded to personally seat us and serve us coffee/tea. The whole hotel is extremely modern and updated and clean. I have to say this hotel did nothing wrong. The entire staff from the front desk to the restaurants all made our stay comfortable and I would definately stay there again and recommend it to any of my friends that are visiting London. This hotel I give an A+ in all areas."
93,1038,"Aug 16 2008 	AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE	The location of thiis hotel is ideal for a visit to the london eye and other top attractions. Located alongside the Thames near the Lambeth pier/ bridge it took us a gentle ten minute walk to the London Eye and this was with a 4 year old and 2 year old in tow. . The checking in was very quick and simple and the staff were all very friendly .The concierge desk was very busy but they are very efficient and know their stuff so don't be affraid to get as much information as you can .Our stay was part of the executive package and our room was very spacious, clean and modern.The executive lounge was closed but executive packages were still catered for in the lower lounge area . This was a very nice experience with complimentary drinks and canapes. It was very relaxing and the staff were very accommodating and efficient. Breakfast was served in the Latino restaraunt and and A la Carte menu was on offer. Once again all staff were very efficient and friendly. The breakfast was very nice with a good choice for adults and children. Overall we were very pleased with our choice of hotel, it covered everything we wanted from a good location to hotel amenities and we highly recommend this hotel. Thanks to all the staff for ensuring our visit was so enjoyable. ."
94,1038,"Jul 30 2008 	Fantastic Hotel	Stayed in this hotel for two nights and it was super. On the other side of the river from most of the attractions but was easily accessible by the tube. The room was spotless and very modern with great attention payed to detail. Lovely toiletries, fruit plate, slippers etc provided and we were just stying in thier basic room! View from the hotel over the river at night is really quite beautiful. Some of the rooms at the back of the hotel are perhaps a little close to a railway line, so when booking I would suggest that you ask for a room at the side or front. Great service in the bar downstairs, although a little pricey - around 17 for two spirits and mixers. Overall I would recommend this hotel to all and will make a point of returning myself."
95,1038,Jul 30 2008 	Pillows to die for	I stayed one night in this hotel in early July with other colleagues. The bedrooms were lovely and it is a real pleasure having a separate shower and bath rather than the usual over bath shower common in many London hotels. The pillows were the most comfortable I have had in any hotel and would have really liked to bring one home! Breakfast was good and freshly cooked. My room overlooked the rear of the hotel so it wasn't good but for one night it was fine. I didn't have dinner in the hotel but my colleagues did and said the food was very good.My only gripe was the long wait we had to check in to the hotel. It got to the stage where staff brought drinks for those in the queue so not an ideal start if you are on holiday or in a hurry to get to your room.I would stay here again but perhaps try and get a room with a river view.
96,1038,"Jul 28 2008 	Great hotel for business and sightseeing alike	I stayed here for several weeks on business and had a thoroughly pleasant experience. The staff was helpful, food was good, and price reasonable (all things considered for London). Location was good in its own way (close enough to walk across the bridges to see the sights, but not right downtown with the hordes of tourists). I met two very nice HR staff from the hotel who were extremely hospitable and friendly. That experience made me respect the high caliber of staff the hotel attracts which is apparent from the courtesy and professional with which they carry themselves. Overall, five stars. Couldn't ask for much more in a hotel"
97,1038,"Jul 24 2008 	great hotel - central located - but still in a quite area - excellent for long s	We stayed as a family in this hotel for 12 days partly business partly private. The hotel is great, luxery rooms. very pleasant staff working the hotel. rooms are clean. we really enjoyed staying in London fro such a long period"
98,1038,"Jul 22 2008 	Good spacious hotel request river view upon booking	I booked a mystery room via last minute.com so got a superior room at quite a bargain rate. I requested a river view on booking (about 2 months in advance) and although they seemed to have forgotten, they changed us to a river view room on the 8th floor (I'm pretty sure it was not an upgrade) when we asked again at check in. It had spectacular views of the Westminster, especially at night (room 841). the room was spacious, with a large lounge room with a flat screen TV. The mini bar is locked unless you leave a credit card imprint with them (there is a very sensitive sensor in the fridge which deducts from the credit card every time you move an item from its spot). There is near no room for personal items to be left in the fridge. Having said that, there is an ice machine on each floor which was very handy. there is also a flat screen TV in the bedroom as well. The bathroom was also fantastic, with a large selection of toiletries, a separate bath and shower. There was a complimentary bath robe and pair of slippers. The only strange thing about the hotel was that when we requested an additional bath robe (they gave us one for a double room), this was denied flatly for no explained reason. On the second day, housekeeping also gave us two cactuses which was a little strange.The concierge and check-in staff were very nice (especially a man called Tom). The food at Chino Latino is also very good, and comes at a reasonable price with a 25% discount given in the room. All in all, the room and service was fantastic. The location is within walking distance to the London Eye. It is about 10-15 minutes walking distance from Vauxhall and Lamberth North, which is not the most convenient with luggage (there is a bus which you can take for one stop from Vauxhall station to the hotel)."
99,1038,"Jun 18 2008 	Excellent Location and Service	I am constantly amazed at the things about which people complain. The negative comments in some other reviews of this hotel are generally churlish at best. I found it to be clean, well maintained, and friendly. The service was excellent and cheerfully rendered. Our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The concierge, Thom, was a great help with some problems associated with a tour company and with dining recommendations. The location was as good as I could possibly have wished. It is only a leisurely walk to any destination in the Westminster area and not much further for others. The Vauxhall Underground station is nearby and serves as a good departure point for many city locations. The restaurant was quite good, if a bit pricey. However, there were many fine and quaint places to eat within easy walking distance or, at most, a short cab ride.It is true that the railway route to and from Waterloo station goes right behind the hotel. However, I made sure to get a room away from that location and had no noise problem. Moreover, there is a convenient ATM right next to the hotel entry and a mini-mart adjacent on the other side. Not to mention the phone booth just outside the cab area (important if you want to make overseas calls with a calling card and not pay the hotel fees). Very convenient. All in all, an enjoyable stay and highly recommended."
100,1038,"Jun 3 2008 	Very disappointing; room not cleaned properly; strong smell of cigs	Booked into this hotel by my company; map wrong so I alighted at wrong Tube and arrived shattered and near collapse (medical reasons). In spite of my obvious distress, was not asked to sit down while checking in, sit down check-in desk only feet away. Was upgraded though to river front room; told that my &quot;normal&quot; company room would have been at the back overlooking the very busy rail lines and I wouldn't have got any sleep! Room was a very long walk from the lift (furthest room away, and remember my state!). VERY strong smell of cigarette smoking (non smoking room and corridor) and carpet hadn't been vacuum cleaned properly; after complaining, room was freshened by spray. Otherwise very pleasant room.Hotel very distant from London eating places so visited the expensive Asian type &quot;fushion&quot; restaurant (with 25% discount card from room). Meal was very good and service excellent and friendly (not owned by hotel). Breakfast was included in my rate and was good with very good staff.Called and spoke to duty manager about the room issues, check-in and a number of other things; listened politely; did nothing. On return home, quite by chance, found out that hotel had debited my card twice; no apology though it was put right.Probably a good hotel but &quot;careless&quot; management?"
101,1038,"Jun 1 2008 	Fantastic view and service to match	I travel to London on a regular basis and its hard to find a good hotel in London without paying 300 GBP plus. Riverbank Park Plaza is a great find. Rooms are contemporary fresh, SPACIOUS bathrooms, plasma screen and wifi in rooms. A room for the business traveller. The hotel bar was again very modern and stylish with a great vive. Chino Lationa the main restaurant was a great place, fun, great food, stylish...I loved it!"
102,1038,"May 23 2008 	Nothing Special	The Park Plaza is located on the Albert Embankment a fair trek from the tube. The double room for single occupancy was an adequate size, the comfortable bed with 'pillow menu' is recommended - such a shame insulation between rooms is not to such a high standard. Or the fact that the hotel backs onto the train lines (there are at least seven of them) into Waterloo and fronts a busy dual carriageway. Well proportioned bath room - towels were fine if a bit on the small side. Plenty of essential toiletries provided. My worst gripe is breakfast, 2.50 for two slices of toast with jam is an absolute disgrace but no one cares. 3.00 for burnt coffee was also a rip off."
103,1038,"May 16 2008 	Very pleasant stay	We stayed at the Riverbank Plaza for a long weekend and had a very pleasant stay. We booked it as a &quot;mystery hotel&quot; through lastminute.com and had a very nice surprise! The location is convenient, the London Eye was only 10 minutes' walk away and there was a grocery store right next to the hotel for buying fruit etc.Staff was very helpful and professional and made our stay enjoyable. When I found I was allergic to the feather cushions and requested synthetic pillows from the front desk they arrived straight away. Concierge was helpful too and advised us as to which tubelines were closed during our stay. There are trainlines right behind the hotel and unless you have an executive suite your room will face the trainlines and not the river. However, I'm a light sleeper and still didn't find it much of a problem. Room service was good too and not too expensive. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated in Japanese style. Bathroom had a tub and a shower cubicle, complimentary toiletries and was spotless. Hairdryer and ironing board also provided.I can recommend this hotel to anybody who needs a stylish and confortable hotel close to Westminster."
104,1038,"May 16 2008 	River location but not always a river view!	With a hotel located only a few yards from the Thames, you might well think you would be enjoying a wonderful view of the river and nearby Houses of Parliament; not the case Im afraid, with the most views being of a wall of windows or a busy railway track. Fortunately for me, having read Trip Advisor members reviews, I was prepared for my view of the wall of windows; however, as it was only for one night and my boss was paying, it was not a real issue for me. That aside, the hotel does have a wonderful ambience, feeling spacious and clean. My standard double room was well decorated with all the usual facilities you would expect from a 4 star establishment. The lighting was especially imaginative with strong orange lighting over the heavily netted window. The separate shower and bath was a nice touch of luxury and the large bed was extremely comfortable. There were some disappointments: there was virtually no hot water at 7.30 am which made my morning shower a chilly affair! The plates at breakfast were cold and so my scrambled egg ended up at the same temperature as my shower. The TV remote control did not work. Also, as is usual, the Minibar was exorbitantly priced with a can of coke priced at 2.50 and a Mars bar at 1.50! I probably would not stay at this hotel again unless I could be guaranteed a river view (or someone else was paying)."
105,1038,"May 15 2008 	Really Ropey - what a shame	Booked this on lastminute as an executive room but then found out on check in that had to pay an extra 35 quid - rip off and stress ful. Had issues with room service not arriving, check in being 30 minutes delay - meaning we ate in the restaurant only to find in our room there was a ticket for a 25% discount! Rang reception to sort out a problem with the minibar - my husband moved some things around but you get charged if you touch stuff, but on check out found out they'd done nothing - and another time we rang for something and again were lied to.Then we arranged a late check out only to have a cleaner barge in and tap her watch angrily at us. To add insult to injury the receptionist then said she would make sure we had some compensation and haven't received a thing!They lie. They're rude.Don't go here or go being prepared to complain loudly. I wouldn't have posted this but they didn't even get in touch with our compensation - I think that's appalling service.Go to Novotel they're much better."
106,1038,"May 14 2008 	Good Value Weekend Rate	Good value hotel 5 - 10mins walk from Westminster and Waterloo. Probably a 4*, with decent sized rooms and bathrooms, all furnished well with Wifi in the rooms.We booked the &quot;Enjoy the Weekend&quot; rate which was around 120 for a superior room, continental breakfast, late checkout and free bottle of wine. Room very clean, breakfast was varied and fresh (we paid a 4 upgrade to full English). I would recommend that you include breakfast in the rate, as it is very expensive at 13.50/17.50 for continental/ English.Only small downside is the lack of nearby tube station. The Victoria line was suspended when we visited so could not use Vauxhall, but I think even this station is 10 mins away. We had to walk along the South Bank in very warm weather with bags (but to be fair, it is a lovely walk past the London Eye and Houses of Parliament and we could have got a taxi). Otherwise, absolutely no complaints."
107,1038,"May 8 2008 	Nice hotel great staff fantastic restaurant	This hotel was booked for me as a surprise birthday present and turned out to be a very pleasant surprise indeed.We had a superior room which was very nice with a very comfortable bed (although i wasnt a fan of the very squishy pillows - but that may just be me!). The bathroom was lovely and spotlessly clean, as was the rest of the room. We didnt have much of a view though - only of the train tracks, although the train noise was very minimal.The only complaint regarding the room was that the air conditioning didnt seem to be working, and even when we turned it down to the lowest setting it still blasted out warm-ish air. After calling reception about this they sent an engineer up within 5 minutes which was impressive (at 1am as well), but after taking a look he mumbled something about the main powerplant and said he would go and sort it out - which he obviously never did because the problem was still there. This was temporarily solved by the engineer opening a window for us - which i am sure is against many H&amp;S guidelines as we were on the 7th floor, and also meant that train noise increased. This wasnt really a major problem for us though as we were barely in the room - out seeing shows etc, in the hotel restaurant/bar etc. But if we had been spending most of the time in there it would have made much more of an impact because the room was too warm most of the time.The best part of the hotel is the restaurant, which is also open to outside guests. It is fairly expensive - around 20ish for a dish, but well worth a visit with the headchef there having previously been the head chef at Nobu. We received a 25% off voucher for a meal in our room which was a nice touch, and that combined with excellent food and fantastic service - the staff were attentive without being overbearing - made for a very enjoyable meal.This hotel is definately worth its 4 star rating and has a great location, and if we hadnt experienced the air con problems i would have def rated it a 5."
108,1038,May 4 2008 	Noisy	Booked hotel as part of a lastmin.com package deal with theatre tickets.I booked this as a surprise few days in London for my partners birthday.Room was nice and the room service staffs were very friendly.The reception staffs were not very friendly they just seemed like they didnt want to help you. The noise pollution was unreal both of us could not sleep properly for 2 nights! For the price of 249.00 it should have been stated before booking!!!!!The position of the hotel was good but as you only stay here to sleep not impressed.
109,1038,"May 3 2008 	Not the best hotel in London......	We booked and paid for our stay online, and we wanted a room with the view facing the River Thames, so this seemed like the perfect hotel. When we arrived, we gave our confirmation to the reception guy, who informed us that the room we booked was not available!He told us he would upgrade us to a better room, free of charge, which we thought was good.When we got to our room, we looked out of the window to find we were only about 10 feet from the mainline railway tracks....Even with the TV blaring, we could still hear the trains going past every 5-15 minutes, which was very noisy. also, whenever anybody used the hot water, we had a high pitched noise going right through the room! Needless to say, we had an almost sleepless night with the trains going past, and not very relaxing as we would of hoped for.We would not go back to stay there again !! If anybody is booking this hotel online, I would urge them to be very wary, as they may not get the room they pay for."
110,1038,"May 1 2008 	River view suite	I initially made my booking for this hotel through last minute.com. The price for 2 rooms seemed very reasonable and although the hotel was at a secret location the reviews looked good. Upon being given the details of the hotel I checked there regular prices and was suitably pleased, however this booking seemed to fall outside there guaranteed lowest price online guarantee.Prior to our arrival at the hotel we upgraded our room from an exec double to a suite with a river view. We were charged 100 by the hotel for this upgrade. I have to say I was very impressed with the room and view. The suite comprised of a large lounge area with desk, sofa, flat screen TV (although a little small for the room size) and plenty of other bits an peices. The view through the floor to ceiling window really was a treat. There was then a seperate bedroom with another TV and plenty of storage space. The bathroom had everything you would expect for a hotel bathroom. Our friend also stayed in the hotel and it is worth noting that he got an upgrade from the standard (Superior) double to an exec double. It should be noted however that these are exactly the same rooms but some extras are the reason for the 35 upgrade charge. For this you received bathrobes and some bits and bobs for the room. You also got breakfast included and access to the executive lounge.The hotel itself was very pleasant and the breakfast really good. I took the advice I had previously seen on here and eat downstairs. The access and additional feature of access to the executive lounge was a bit of a let down. The room is fairly small, doesn't have any view of the city that you would want. The complimentary drinks offer was only between 6pm and 8pm and the snacks were few and far between. All drinks however were served by the dedicated waiter although I suspect this may be to stop those wishing to get there monies worth of drinks.We did use the hotel valet parking and although not advertised there is a 26 a night fee for this. In summary I have to say it really was a great stay and I would recommend it to others. If you can manage the extra fee for the river views it really is a treat."
111,1038,Apr 18 2008 	Great Concierge services.	Great Concierge service....Thanks Thom.
112,1038,"Apr 13 2008 	Be careful where they stick you!	Having just returned from a virtually sleepless Saturday night I feel sufficiently moved to write a review. Don't get me wrong, it's a very nice hotel, impressive reception, smiling staff (although I'd like to see how they justify a 17.50 breakfast, but I digress) - just watch out which room they give you!We thought that our luck was in when we were upgraded to a suite (room 303) - how wrong could you be...As you will note on the maps, there are six lanes of railway tracks directly behind the hotel, and the woeful sound insulation in our suite made us feel like we were attempting to bed down in the middle of St Pancreas station. The trains clatter on until about 11pm, and start again relentlessly at 5.45am - even earplugs didn't drown out the clatter. Seriously, I am not overstating how loud the trains were.My partner and I had paid for this hotel through Lastminute as part of a theatre deal and if I had paid full price for a suite I would be demanding my money back.You have been warned!"
113,1038,"Apr 8 2008	A Nice Hotel	Located on the bank of the Thames River, it has a terrific view of Big Ben and Parliament on the other side. The rooms are small by american standards but ALL rooms are small in the UK. The hotel does feature 3 restaurants- one in the bar and another 2 off the lobby. The location is a bit far from the crowds and touristy places but cabs and buses will quickly get you wherever you want to go. It is clean and quiet with very helpful staff."
114,1038,"Apr 7 2008	Woke up with flea bites!	This was our second stay at the Park Plaza. We were very impressed the first time around with the huge suite we were given and beautiful bathroom. It was a fantastic deal too at only 100 through lastminute.com.However, this time, we were left sorely disappointed. We decided to pay slightly more and upgrade to an executive room (which included a full English breakfast) but what a mistake that turned out to be. The room was half the size, had four or five ciggarette burns in the carpet, a broken toilet seat and a very unattractive view of the railway track.We tried to make the best of it and did have an ok(ish) time until the following morning.....however, when we both woke up we were covered in flea bites! We are not really the type to complain but both felt that the amount of money we had paid, together with the poor condition of the room and the flea bites did warrant enough of a reason to highlight this to the reception staff. The person we spoke to initially didn't say too much but advised the Guest Relations Manager would come and speak to us. Half an hour later, she turned up and said she had sent a colleague to check the room - almost implying we had made it up. My boyfriend then showed his bites and I did too and there wasn't really much they could say. As we had pre-paid through lastminute.com, we were not allowed a refund on the hotel bill but they did waive our parking charge and discount our room service bill by 50%. I was fairly disappointed with this as I felt our complaint hadn't really been taken that seriously. We were also offered a free upgrade the next time we stay, however, I think that the likelihood of us going back is pretty low!All in all, a good hotel, if you get the right room with a decent view but I think the majority of rooms need a big upgrade along with the hotels staff."
115,1038,"Mar 27 2008 	An excellent time was had in an excellent hotel	I was lucky enough to stay at the Park Plaza hotel over the bank holiday Monday during the Easter period. I stayed there with my girlfriend for our first anniversary. We were lucky to stay in this hotel as we paid for it through lastminute.com through the mystery hotel section. We paid for 1 night's accomodation in a suite for 75 and it was worth every penny. Unfortunately we didn't have good views out of our window as we faced the railway track rather than being on the opposite side of the hotel which faces the houses of parliament and the river Thames. On occasion we did hear the trains passing by however this didn't cause too much of a disturbance to us. We used the hotel as a base to explore London. The hotel is a 10 minute walk to the houses of Parliament and approximately the same to the London Eye. The underground system is in easy walk ing distance from the hotel and is a very convenient way of exploring what London has to offer. The hotel was amazing value for money at 75 for the night. I would stretch to 90 for the night at this hotel, anymore and I think it would be hard to justify. The breakfasts and food items on the menu seem over priced and not worth shelling out for when you consider that there are hundreds of eating establishments in central London. For the business user I could see this as a perfect hotel to stay in. For personal use it is very good and of a high standard although a little pricey if you have to pay the full asking price."
116,1038,"Mar 27 2008 	Eggcellent	Stayed for 4 nights over the Easter weekend. Got a great rate of 79 room only plus taxes with the hotel. Checking in and out was seamless, didn't have much interaction with the staff other than that. Very close to Vauxhall Station which makes everything within easy reach; once you have your oyster card, you can spend all day on the underground. As mentioned the Victoria Line closes around 10pm but any night were out late we got a taxi for less than 10 from Leicester Square/Piccadilly. The walk along the river embankment is very nice and well worthwhile if you don't mind stretching your legs.Hotel room was modern, comfortable &amp; spacious and with a slight river view which is probably as much as you get without upgrading. Large bathroom with separate shower and bath. Room included mini bar, safe, iron &amp; ironing board, hair-dryer etc. Both were spotless on arrival and everyday on our return no matter how much of a mess we'd made!I wouldn't classify this as a touristy hotel, but then it's great to escape from the crowds in the evening after battling them all day. However given the friendliness of the staff I'm sure they would be able to help with any requests."
117,1038,"Mar 26 2008 	Ok base for city break	This is a modern hotel situated about 5 minutes from Vauxhall tube station, I got a good deal through lastminute.com, not sure if I would pay the goign rate for thsi hotel.Check in was appaling, very slow and un-organised, everything seemed to take ages. The rooms are actually quite nice, but make sure you dont get a room at the back of the hotel. These rooms face on to the main line to Waterloo and it gets very noisy until quite late at night. Our room had an LCD TV , the internet access is via a seperate handset which is a complete waste of time, pages dont fit on the screen correclty and the keypad is so slow, dont waste your money on this, use and internet cafe in town.Dining, the menu was ok if you like Pan Asian food, its not that cheap but inline with hotel prices in London, we didnt use the restaurant as chose to eat out. The Portuguese restaurant near the garage is amazing and well worth a visit. You can catch a No.3 bus into the city or walk to the tube.Overall its an average hotel a little isolated from the city, but it doesnt take long to get there, ideally situated for the London eye"
118,1038,"Mar 25 2008 	Great Hotel	Booked with Lastminute.com for the Easter Holidays. Had a great weekend. Stayed in Executive room, great extras.Couldn't fault the hotel. Good location with bus number 77 stopping right outside which takes you as far as Waterloo. Friendly and helpful staff. Would stay here again."
119,1038,"Mar 24 2008 	Very nice hotel	My husband and I stayed for 10 days at the Riverbank Park Plaza during our Honeymoon to London. The lobby is beautifully appointed and the staff seemed very friendly. Hotel has a restaurant and very interesting-looking bar with contemporary dcor. The hotel room was smaller than many American hotel standards, but was spacious by European standards. The en suite bathroom was well kept and spacious, but did lack extensive counter space for toiletries. The room itself was very attractive, with one exception  visibly stained carpet. Aside from that, the room seemed clean and was comfortable after we acclimated to the more compact size of London hotels. A few points for American travelers to keep in mind  we learned this the hard way  there is no clock, alarm or otherwise, in the hotel room. Apparently, that is common in Europe. Take a travel clock with you. On a positive note for the American traveler, a few US standard outlets were included in the room! While there was a hairdryer included in the room, it has a button that must be firmly and continuously pressed to run it. I found that made it very difficult to maneuver for styling and I ended up buying a regular one at a local drug store. Neither my husband nor I cared for the room service food, however, we paid a little extra for a package that included breakfast on the executive level. The breakfast was pretty good and included enough options to satisfy just about anyone from continental options to hot eggs and sausage. We were disappointed in the way the hotel handled WIFI access. You were required to pay extra for access and it was limited to one hour per day. The hotel sits right on the Themes with some views of Lambeth Bridge and Parliament. 10-15 minute walk to Vauxhall tube station was fairly convenient for public transportation within London. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would return to the Riverbank Park Plaza!"
120,1038,"Mar 19 2008 	park plaza	spent a night here...certainly a nice hotel but they push the &quot;near houses of parliament&quot; tag a bit much .While it is quite close to parliament,I doubt many roooms have the view of the houses of parliament that appear on their website and in their literature in the rooms,ours certainly did not,we had a view over eight railway lines.Luckily we only stayed saturday night.I would imagine that weekday noise from trains would result in early awakenings.I think they started about 0600 hrs on the sunday we were there.Other than that we had to ask twice for the complimentary wine which we were meant to get.We had no problem with the very good quality of the hotel,ordered room service which was good.7.60 for two pints of lager including a service charge (thought that was a bit cheeky) ....Would certainly consider a stay at this chain of hotels again"
121,1038,"Mar 17 2008 	Wonderful Views	Stayed here after a late night meeting in Westminster. Its a 10 minute walk across Lambeth Bridge from the House of Commons. Easy to find from the directions provided although the hotel signage is low key at night.I didn't check in before the meeting so arrived late (11:30) pm only to be told there were no more doubles. For a nanosecond I thought they might taxi me to their sister hotel at County Hall but instead they upgraded me to a 9th floor river view suite.The view was excellent across the river to the House of Lords/Commons, Big Ben and (just about) the London Eye. The suite was first rate, very contemporary and spacious. TVs and DVDs in the lounge and bedroom. Bathrobes, slippers, full sized wardrobes, iron and ironing board, tea and coffee making, lots of free TV channels. The bathroom was also excellent and sacrificed function for form with a bath and separate shower in a black polished granite design and lots of free toiletries including shoe polishers, combs, razors, toothbrushes etc.Breakfast in the morning was included in the rate although it was served in the Club Lounge, a subterranean affair with no natural light and a buffet on par with Holiday Inn Express. It was quite busy with business travellers and looked a bit understaffed although the staff worked hard to keep everyone supplied with coffee etc.Fast and accurate check-in and check out. First class experience provided you can pay for teh river view. Otherwise you can only hope for an upgrade!"
122,1038,"Mar 11 2008 	Great hotel comfortable and helpful staff	Just returned from a business trip to London and stayed at the Park Plaza (March 2 - March 8, 2008). Overall, I really enjoyed the hotel. Very clean, bed was comfortable, room had everything I needed and was even very spacious. Bathroom was spacious as well with separate tub from shower. Only downfall I can state was minor and that was the shower drainedd extreemely slow almost to the point of spilling over the edge. Staff was helpful and very accomodating, especially since they let me into my room at 7:00 am when I checked in (arrived at LHR at 6:00 am) I would definitely recommend this hotel.Pros: Clean, spacious, comfortable and a very helpful staff.Cons: non really...Other things to note. Closest tube stop is about 5-10 minute walk. The hotel website says Waterloo is the closest station however the closest station is Vauxhall. Waterloo is more like 15-20 minute walk away. And the Vauxhall stop is on the Victoria Line which currently shuts down at 10:30 pm, so if you're out later than that and want to get back, you might be stuck with a cab.Buses can be caught right in front of the hotel as well."
123,1038,"Mar 10 2008 	Great Price for Weekend Stay - Fabulous Location!	We were fortunate enough to escape to London for a few days in February 2008, and got a great deal on this hotel! We paid just under $150 per night (including taxes) which we thought was a steal given the location and amenities.The doorman, Stephen, was fantastic to us! He gave us lots of tips on things to enjoy in the area, and really helped us make the most of our short visit.Our room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was modern and roomy. Even though our value-priced room was on the back side of the hotel, we didn't hear anything at night (i.e. trains) from our 9th floor room.The check-in experience was great for us, but I felt sorry for the couple checking-in next to us. Their agent wasn't nearly as helpful or polite as ours! We arrived around 11am, and they were able to put us right in our non-smoking room as requested. Bonus!We didn't eat at the restaurant (I was stunned breakfast for two would be 25 pounds), but there are lots of choices nearby. If you head out the front doors and go left, there is a great pub a few minutes away called The Rose. They have decent food, a nice atmosphere, and it is filled with locals which is nice. Also, it's very reasonably priced.If you walk out of the hotel doors and head to your immediate right, there is a small grocery store with fresh bread, snacks, beer, wine and incidentals. Quite convenient!We were but a 10-minute walk to the London Eye, very near lots of sites and attractions, and close to the tube. All-in-all, a great location!Beware, the tube is running on a greatly reduced schedule with many lines and stops closed on the weekend. We had quite an adventure getting home one night!We had a great experience here, and for the price would highly recommend it to others.Cheers!D"
124,1038,"Mar 10 2008 	great stay	we stayed on saturday 8th march 2008 in 3 double rooms.i booked it very last minute directly with the hotel.i had shortlisted the hotel but hadn`t booked as it was slightly above our price range so i rang the hotel directly and they gave us a rate of 101 per room including continental b/f, a bottle of wine per room and late checkout.(i explained we were all celebrating our anniversaries)the hotel is directly over the road from the thames and from outside you can see westminster / london eye.only executive rooms have this view,we read reviews about it being near a train track so i requested quiet rooms and we had room 710, 725 and 727.they explained our room 725 was slightly larger and it certainly was a better sized room and it had the addition of a settee and table and if you looked to thwe left you could see the river.when we arrived we were told the rooms would be ready at 12 but we went off to shop and returned at 2 anyway.as you go out the hotel entrance you turn left to the nearest tube,vauxhall,which took us 4 to 5 mins to walk to.not a pleasant looking area,just roads,a garage a couple of small shops and a motorbike shop.entrance and lobby very nice,very helpful and friendly concierge,check in quick,rooms are quited neutral colours but everything was spotlessly clean ( i work as a wedding planner and housekeeper so i am known for being over fussy) but i couldn`t find any fault in any of the rooms.within a minute of us going in someone came with a very nice bottle of wine and glasses.bed very very comfy,shower cubicle separate to bath was so clean i didn`t even see the one side - it looked like it was open.all black slate and marble with trendy style sink etc, and white towels and chrome fittings.lighting was good.only gripes ? the hotel is very very close to another building that looked like apartments and you were directly opposite them although there were blackout curtains which was private at night but the bathroom was facing the window and had slightly opaque frosted large doors so had to close curtains on that end of room (windows were floor to ceiling and our room being slightly bigger they were also the whole side of the one wall which was nice.one other thing is we should have asked for 2 key cards as you have to keep it in to keep lights on so when i was in bath,hubby went to one of the other rooms to get me something andtook the card with him as i wouldn`t be able to let him back in but it meant the lights went off ! overall would stay again and recommend.oh and the breakfast room was in the basement which is a shame as i`m sure they could have put it on a floor facing the river to make the most of the view but this room has no windows but was extremely pleasant and clean with very nice selection and was buffet style so we were able to have as much as we wanted."
125,1038,"Mar 4 2008 	Good City Centre Hotel	I stayed here for one night mid-week on a business trip. The hotel was in a handy location for me and the room was lovely. Bed was very comfortable, breakfast fine, service and staff very good. I wasn't in the hotel very long - perhaps 12 hours in total (6 or 7 of which were spent sleeping) so I didn't eat dinner in the hotel or relax in the bar but the bar looked quite inviting and funky. All in all a very pleasant stay. I would stay in this hotel again."
126,1038,"Mar 4 2008 	Good hotel good location	I stayed at the Riverbank Park Plaza 13-15 February on a business trip, along with a colleague. I was very impressed with the hotel and would certainly recommend it. The location was ideal for our course in a building close to the houses of Parliament.We arrived early on the Wednesday and the hotel stored our baggage for us whilst we attended our course. When we returned in the evening check in was smooth and my colleague was able to request a smoking room.The room itself was lovely. It had everything required, including a safe and was kept clean and tidy. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was heavenly. Complimentary toiletries were replenished as I used them. We were lucky enough to have rooms that were not at the back of the building overlooking the railway line. Guests that stayed in these rooms complained of the constant noise.There was a variety of choice for breakfast (I believe we had the full breakfast option as opposed to the continental style). Fruit, yogurts, pastries, cereals, cooked breakfast etc.We did not eat at the restaurant as we had been warned the food was overpriced. Instead we walked both nights to the Leicester Square/China town/Piccadilly circus area. The walk was very pleasant along the river and passed some well known tourist attractions. Even for someone like me who does not like walking, it was within a reasonable distance.Overall, a very pleasant stay and I would certainly return."
127,1038,"Mar 3 2008 	We love the restaurant	We have stayed several times at the hotel and simply love it. We have used it for business and for weekend stays. It is a modern, very chic hotel with a super service and one of the best restaurants (Chino Latino Brasserie) we have eaten at in London. This is very unusul - a hotel restaurant that has a really super top kitchen. The rooms are spacy with comfortable beds, and if you have booked a river facing room, the view is spectacular. You can keep track of time on Big Ben and see the lights along the river. The service really is excellent, professional and friendly and the decoration is modern and a cross-over of modern Europe and Asian style. We will most certainly come back - the situation is excellent and we feel very welcome."
128,1038,Mar 1 2008 	Not bad but Executive supplement questionable	Having got a cheapie flight we spent one night here whilst taking in a show.We paid for the Executive upgrade which I'm really not sure is worth the money - the exclusive executive lounge is a bit bland and the only refreshments are on offer are tea and coffee. (The free wine is only available 6 to 8 when most people will be out!). We had to have our breakfast in the main restaurant as the executive lounge was full.Good hotel and I can't complain about it but as I say not sure the Executive supplement is worth while.
129,1038,"Feb 29 2008	Nice hotel but very pricey	Just returned from the hotel, attended a conference and in all honesty it would not have been my choice to stay there as it's pricy, there are alternatives I would have used if I had the opportunity. The hotel is what you expect for this level of cost, clean, tidy and decorated in a Japanese theme, breakfast is very good but you expect that to be for 20. Food in the restaurant was pretentious and too expensive and nothing very special, beer was overpriced and limited to a tasteless Japanese brew.Only real positive attribute were the staff, courteous and extremely friendly."
130,1038,"Feb 28 2008 	Hotel could not do enough for us	I booked this hotel as it was new, it seemed very clean from the images and the trip was for a special occasion.From the moment I contacted the hotel to ask what they could do to help make this occasion special, I knew I'd made the right choice. They came back immediately with package options and were very friendly in correspondence.When we got there, we were greeted by very friendly check in staff and when we arrived in the room, there was a hand written card wishing a happy birthday from the manager and a bottle of wine. This personal touch was very welcoming. We rang down for a corkscrew and a hotel member of staff was there quickly, also asking if they could be anymore help.When we went for dinner at the hotel restaurant later that night, the waiter we had could not do enough for us either, even arranging a small little cake and sparkler, free of charge. Then he proceeded to seat us on a sofa in the main bar and take our wine and glasses there. The service was amazing.Overall and coupled with the late check out as requested, I have to say that this hotel has the best service I have been to so far, from correspondence, check in, to check out, they could not have done enough. I have been to a lot of countries and stayed in a lot of hotels, but I will definitely be coming back to this one"
131,1038,Feb 18 2008 	OK	We had high expectations of this hotel but to be quite honest it was just a mediocre hotel. The first room we were given was still being serviced (even though we checked in way after the 2pm check in time). The next room we were given was ok but little things like the hair dryer was missing (which we had to wait ages to get a replacement). The hotel is quite a distance from the true hustle and bustle of London although the tubes made it fairly easy. Not that easy to find from Vauxhall station (unless you know London very well). Exiting the station with the bus station in front you need to take a right and this is Albert embankment. The hotel is about 500 m along the road.
132,1038,"Feb 3 2008 	Amazing Experience!	I had the most pleasant stay at the Park Plaza Riverbank Hotel in London just recently. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel; everything was perfect from check-in to check-out, especially the staff! What a great crew! I arrived an hour prior to regular check-in times, yet they were very friendly and accommodating, taking care of my luggage while I went for a walk in the nearby area. The doorman was exceptionally friendly and chatty, giving great tips on where to go. (Very nice neighborhood, clean and safe.) I made my reservation directly with the hotel website, and opted to upgrade to one of their Executive rooms with a river view, something I certainly recommend to avoid the not so great view of the backside. And how this payed off! The front desk set me up in room 1045, with the most spectacular views of Houses of parliament, Big Ben, the river Thames and the London Eye. It could not have been any better! The room was spotless, spacious and very inviting and modern. Moodlights in the floor- to ceiling-windows really gave a fantastic ambient atmosphere at night, and again the view at night was even more awesome. The Media Centre was easy to use, with movies available on demand (surcharge) a varied choice of popular international and domestic tv-channels and music on demand, every genre available. And what comfortable beds! Also note there was a pillow-menu, great feature!The bath was also large and bright, with separate shower and tub. Also in the Executive package were nice amenities such as vanity kits, combs, soaps etc. Room service was fantastic, and it took no more than 15 minutes to receive a well prepared and tasty dish at a reasonable price. The woman who brought it over was again a great example of the friendly staff, all being genuinely interested in the well-being of their guests, something you don't often come across these days. Also, your television comes equipped with a keyboard to surf the net or check your mail, but it might be a bit tricky to get used to. If you would rather want a real computer, their business centre located on the lower level is absolutely outstanding with everything you need and great assistance from staff. All in all I cannot recommend a better hotel in this area. Some people have found the distance to the tube a bit lengthy, yet you still FEEL as if you're in the very centre of all the action and come on, it's only a ten minute walk:) I will definitely stay at this hotel on my next visit to London!"
133,1038,"Jan 29 2008 	Disappointed	Stayed here just for 1 night in January 2008. I stayed here on the back of some good reviews from colleagues, but to be honest I was disappointed. Check-in was fine, a huge reception area adjoining the Chino Latino restaurant. My room was on the 2nd floor right on the corner of Albert Embankment and a side street. First impressions were tainted by two single beds, I was looking forward to a double. The TV didn't work and I had to call for assistance, which to be fair was quick and sorted the problem (cable had dropped out of the rear). The bathroom had a light which stayed on continuously (why!?) and I failed to find a 2-pin shaver socket! Heating is controlled from a wall console and is efficient. Room was clean and tidy, no trouser press but an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe. Tea and coffee provided but no biscuits. Beds were comfortable but the night was spoiled by the noise. Trains at the back and the London Fire Brigade live next door. If you are a trainspotting, fire engine enthusiast you will love it. I did not eat in the restaurant but chose room service. This was efficient but with a 30 minute wait. They even phoned me up to advise on progress and when it came it looked very nice. Unfortunately the meal was served on an icy cold plate which soon turned the entire meal cold. Bar prices are a scream, but the Rose (down the road) is nice. Don't be tempted to walk beyond the Tinworth Street bridge and into the park area. (Mugging Central.) Main roads are fine. Breakfast takes place in the basement. The room is light but no nice views of London to start the day. I had been told this was a really great breakfast selection, but the City Inn across the river knocks spots off this. I asked for tea, got a nice china teapot - with just hot ater and some tea bags. Strange. No offer of toast, you have to help yourself by the look of things. Food was fine, but nothing outstanding. Check out was quick and plenty of cabs outside. As for the walk to Vauxhall Tube, its only about 10 minutes. The walk takes you past the Madeira Cafe, which is a far better option for breakfast! Good honest food at sensible prices. If you have the option of a hotel to stay in, go the the Westminster City Inn. It's much better honestly."

For a 4* hotel i would of expected the room to be clean when we got there, there was a rolled up pair of men's socks under the bed - these remainded there until we left! The staff were very rude and expecially 'Steven@ in the dining hall for breakfast, was very very rude on the last day of our stay. The prices for a drink in the hotel were outrageous - for a bicardi and coke and JD and coke we were paying 20 were in the pub (the rose) down the road we paid 12. Would not reccommend this hotel for people."
135,1038,Jan 24 2008 	Impressive	Modern hotel with all usual facilites. Good oriental restuarant and lively residents bar.
136,1038,"Jan 20 2008 	nice and expensive!	Stayed here for two nights, Friday and Saturday nights, and was very impressed with the surroundings and the ambience. The hotel rooms are well appointed and the beds are very comfortable. Ta and Coffee making facilities are within the room and are regularly replenished. The rooms at the rear of the hotel overlook a main railway into the nearby Waterloo station and those rooms can be noisy if you are on a lower floor.Had a few drinks in the bar and for 1 lager and 1 Southern Comfort it was 12, so if you are watching the pennies then drink elsewhere! There is a pub to the left of the hotel as you exit the front door called The Rose which was quite nice for a few drinks.For two nights, room only I paid 230, breakfast is an extra 14 pernight per person.The location of the hotel is on the opposite bank from the Houses of Parliament and about a 10 minute walk from Big Ben."
137,1038,Jan 16 2008 	Very comfortable	Stayed here for one week in September 2005. Very modern hotel on the Albert Embankment overlooking the River Thames. Nice view of Parliament and Big Ben. Very clean and comfortable room. The DVD player was a nice extra. Very friendly staff. The only minus here is that it is a bit of a walk to the nearest Underground station at Vauxhall.
138,1038,"Jan 15 2008 	Wonderful View of Houses of Parliament	Last time we stayed here we were next to a noisy lift shaft and they offered us an upgrade this time to compensate. We had one of their 'Riverview Suites' which had a phenomenal view of the Thames, Houses of Parliament and Big Ben from the 9th floor. There was a large comfortable sitting room, big bedroom, contemporary bathroom, all the usual trimmings with executive package (bathrobes, fruit, bottled water), TV/DVD/internet etc. The breakfast was fine and we could have also had complimentary drinks and nibbles in the Executive Lounge pre-dinner which is a nice touch. So, no complaints at all this time, we had a lovely weekend. The hotel is walking distance from Parliament Square, Tate Britain, London Eye etc, and buses to the West End which take about 15 minutes. One good tip if you're on a budget or don't want to eat in the hotel - there is an excellent Portuguese cafe and restaurant a few minutes walk away at Vauxhall (under the railway arches) where you can eat generous portions of delicious food (including wonderful cakes and pastries baked on the premises) in a friendly atmosphere for a very reasonable price."
139,1038,"Jan 13 2008 	Excellent stay at the Park Plaza Riverbank	Had a great stay in January 2008 - good location near to Vauxhall tube station, but close enough to walk over the bridge where all the action is.Check-in, check-out, and general customer service was excellent. Standard of room was superb, extremely clean and high-quality.After reading reviews about the noise of trains, I made a request on my booking to be as far away from the railway line as possible. The hotel was accommodating, and we received a room to the side overlooking an apartment building. It is my understanding that you need at least an Executive Room to have a river view. From our room location we were not disturbed by the trains at all.My only complaint was that if you didn't fancy Asian food in Chino Latino, you were stuck because the other restaurant was shut that day without any warning (menus were still displayed in the hotel lobby). I suspect this is not a regular occurence."
140,1038,Jan 6 2008 	Great view from Suites	Just spent weekend in one of their suites overlooking the Thames. Big Ben and Houses of Parliament floodlit- every London tourist's dream view and you can walk there in 10 minutes. Vauxhall tube is 10 minutes the other way and I was in Oxford street in 30 minutes.Agree about the big beds-very comfy but bathroom nothing special- I do NOT want to see myself in a huge mirror whilst on the toilet and then not be able to put makeup on as lighting is not good enough. Nowhere to hang smalls either as washer drier no good would melt them. That saying the self catering area is well equipped and good quality kit.Continental breakfast not very exciting for the money so I will bring my own stuff next time. Noticed a convenience store a few doors away too. Not a sushi etc fan so would pass on the restaurant. Plenty of other lovely places in London if you do some research anyway.Soundproofing quite good compared to most London hotels and even a country mouse like me could sleep. Great base for a weekend or few days in the capital if you can get a good rate.
141,1038,"Jan 6 2008 	Lovely Hotel!!	My boyfriend and I stayed at the Park plaza for a night a week ago. It's a nice clean hotel as soon as you enter. The staff were nice and helpful, and conceierge looked after our luggage whilst we had a drink in the bar before checking into our room. The room we had was a great size and came with beautiful furnishings. The room had an en-suite clean bathroom with both bath and separate shower cubicle.Overall our stay at the hotel was very pleasant, I would stay there again!!"
