199,2107,"Aug 8 2005	Great hotel!	For the price, it was an excellent room--separate shower and tub, tv in the bathroom! Nicely decorated, excellent service all around from the front desk to the room service and parking valets. Convenient location to Union Square and shopping/dining."
200,2107,Aug 3 2005	Great stay at the Pan!	The Pan Pacific exceeded all our expectations and we would stay there any time we visit San Francisco again. The room was exceptionally clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful in making rental car and restaurant reservations. It is very convenient to Union Square and downtown shopping.
201,2107,"Aug 3 2005	So So	We thought the Pan Pacific would offer more than we thought. Although we were able to get this room for a special deal - around $129 per night - we thought we would get so much more for a four star hotel. The room was a bit small, which was okay to us. However, the furniture and carpet were old and did not seem to fit the image of this hotel. The staff was friendly and location great. We would rate this hotel &quot;so so.&quot;"
202,2107,"Jul 29 2005	If this is what a 4 star hotel is about I'll save my money!	My wife and I spent a night at the Pan Pacific as a quick city getaway. We run a B&amp;B, so the idea of having someone else do the concierge, cleaning, and hosting was great. We were also looking forward to sleeping in as we are always up early to prepare breakfast for our guests.Check-in was uneventful and we got the type of room we booked (booked through Expedia even though a direct inquiry to the hotel showed no availability). The room itself was very large (it was a Deluxe King) and the bathroom was really nice. The tub with seperate shower was a plus as my wife could take a relaxing bath while I showered. It seems that the trend in hotels is to provide very large rooms. I don't understand why someone needs such a large room, particularly when they are very sparcely decorated, as was this room. It just made the room feel a bit cold and empty. There was a nice LCD TV, but again, when placed in a room that was so large, it looked really small. Believe it or not, I think a smaller room would've felt much more comfortable and luxurious.The problems began as we got ready for bed. Just as we were about to turn off the lights, my wife noticed a stain on the duvet cover. Upon closer inspection, there several stains (coffee, make-up, etc) and it became obvious that the duvet cover was just plain DIRTY. I called reception and the person who answered said he would send up a replacement. There was no apology and I could not detect the slightest feeling of concern from the person who answered the phone. Housekeeping arrived about 15 minutes later. Unfortunately, the person at reception did not tell housekeeping that it was the duvet cover that needed replacing, not the sheets. Housekeeping (who was very friendly and helpful) brought up new sheets. He looked at the duvet cover and said that they did not have extras. So we asked if he could bring us some extra blankets, which he did. While the blankets themselves were a bit ratty (one had a cigarette burn), they kept us warm. The bed was adequate, but it was NOT the Sealy they boast about in the book they have in the room that boasts about the high level of attention they pay to each guests individual needs. Rather, the mattress was a basic flat mattress with an old featherbed placed on top. We had asked for an 8am wake-up call but didn't need it. At 7:15am, we were awakened by the sound of construction work going on at the adjacent property. We could not go back to sleep. So much for sleeping in.Upon check-out, the person at reception asked how our stay was. When I told her that aside from the dirty duvet cover and being awakened by the construction, it was OK. She gave a nervous laugh and said &quot;Wow, that sounds adventurous. I'm sorry.&quot; I guess she did say sorry, but it was obvious she didn't want to ask any questions and did not want to know any more about it. So much for close attention to their guests individual needs.If this is what you get with a 4-star property and for $269 per night, they can have it. I'll go back to small bed and breakfasts where the owners take a personal interest in making sure each guest's needs are attended to and that each guest is completely happy with every aspect of their stay."
203,2107,"Jul 28 2005	Suberb Hotel	I'm just a teenager, but I've already stayed at some of the world's finest hotels...this one was one of them. It actually compared to the NYC Ritz Carlton. We visited San Fransisco for last year's spring break...instead of our beach house on Hilton Head Island. The hotel was stunningly beautiful. They sent a limo to pick us up from the airport and the staff was wonderfully attentive. The concierge tended to our every need, booking us box seats for the hottest shows in town. (I would highly reccomend attending Teatro Zinzanni...it was fantastic!) It was very close to Chinatown, and since it was right in Union Square, it had AMAZING shopping! Everything from Levi's (where you can get Levi's custom-made for you) to Macy's to Saks. The room service was just great. I can't wait to come back!"
204,2107,"Jul 27 2005	Left my heart at Pan Pacific	Just returned from San Francisco three days ago. After horrible delays with the airline we finally arrived at the Pan Pacific 11 hours late. The hotel was a very pleasant suprise after the dissapointment with the airline. The staff was extremely caring and helpful to us. The room was OUTSTANDING and the private butler service was a nice touch. The bed was just right and the huge bathroom luxurious. My wife took a long hot bath and so everyone was happy. The next day we spoke with Jason at the concierge desk and he was top notch- very knowledgeable and totally professional. I would stay there again for sure. Our maid was happy and pleasant and told us she would come back whenever we wanted since we needed to sleep a little late the first morning. Also, the location is very good for downtown walking and dining, etc. It's a $9.00 cab to Fisherman's Wharf and 22 blocks on foot back there if the cablecars breakdown (they did) and taxi's are all full (they were). You will be spolied at this hotel, but the extra $$$ you pay per night will be worth it."
205,2107,Jul 27 2005	Smart Hotel in a great location	The Pan Pacific is a great hotel in an ideal location to walk around San Francisco and for public transport. The room was spacious and it was great to be able to order room service and rent a movie. Also we asked the concierge for tickets to a giants game on a Saturday and she got them for us soo quickly. All in all a great stay and would go back the next time I was in San Francisco
206,2107,"Jul 25 2005	non-view hotel	Asked for a room (luxury king) with a view upon check-in and was given a room on the 16th floor looking out to a wall. Called the front desk and was told the hotel is a nonview hotel and the room had good views compared to other rooms. Subsquently found out there are rooms available with a view. I told the general manager that I felt the front desk was not up-front with me regarding rooms with a view. I felt they should have just stated none were available if that was the case. The manager stated he would speak to the front desk however he did not ask my name or room number so very doubtful that he followed through. For about the same money the Westin, Hyatt, Marriott and the Fairmont have views and in my opinion have better service."
207,2107,"Jul 17 2005	Great Hotel Very Good Location	My husband and I stayed here over the July 4th weekend of 2005. We were in a luxury king room which we liked very much. It was spacious and we loved the marble appointed bathroom with stall shower and a tub. The service was very good. They have a nice gym. They are just one block west of Union Square and walking distance to Chinatown. As we were leaving the day after the 4th we heard construction noise from across the street, which we had not heard until then because the workers were off for the weekend and holiday - so I recommend you wait until the construction is complete if you plan on being there during the week. We will definitely stay here again next year."
208,2107,"Jul 15 2005	Great Hotel!!!!	My husband and I have traveled extensively and always stay in nice hotels but I must say that the Pan Pacific was one of the best hotels overall we've ever stayed in. It was centrally located with great restaurants, theaters, and shopping within walking distance. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and professional and were very gracious. The check-in was easy and pulling up in front of hotel if you have your own car was convenient, considering that many SF hotels are a disaster in this area! The room was large by SF hotel standards and the bathroom was &quot;to-die-for&quot;!!! The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet even though we were facing a busy street! This hotel is gorgeous from the outside in and extremely clean everywhere. I don't know if it's been recently remodeled but it seems like an almost new hotel. We only stayed one night(Sat., July 9, 05) but we are most assuredly going to stay again!!! P.S. Morten's Steakhouse is one block away with great food though it was a bit noisy!"
209,2107,"Jul 14 2005	Paradise at Pan Pacific	We had the same problem with construction the user below had on July 4th weekend - however, we simply asked to be moved and the hotel promptly had a bellman up to our room to move our bags to the other room. Packing was annoying, but we were leaving in 2 days so it didnt matter much. The rooms were immaculate, bathrooms were clean and gorgeous, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful.Got room service for the night of July 4th, lasagna and a cheese quesadilla and was very tasty.Beds are amazing, and aside from the construction next door (prior to the room change), the rooms were ultra quiet.Would def stay here again"
210,2107,"Jul 8 2005	Great hotel but construction ruined it	In terms of value and quality this was one of the best hotels I've stayed in. The staff is very friendly and the room was clean with a decent amount of space. The bathtub is also a good size for a hotel room so lying in it is very comfortable. My complaint is the construction going on next door. I know this is in no way the Pan Pacific's fault but that doesn't mean it doesn't effect the quality of your stay. I stayed there during the 4th of July weekend and had no problems on Saturday, Sunday or Monday morning since those weren't work days. However, on Tuesday I was woken up at 7am by the sounds of drilling and hammering coming from the building next door. I could not get back to sleep and I'm sure many other guests had the same problem. Who likes to get up at 7am during a vacation or business trip?I would recommend this hotel once the construction is over but while its still going on, I would not want to stay there."
211,2107,"Jun 28 2005	Great Hotel!	My husband and I just returned from a great trip to San Francisco. The Pan Pacific was a great choice for the price. The accomodations were very clean and comfortable and the staff was always very helpful. When we return to SF, we will definitely return to the Pan Pacific."
212,2107,"Jun 27 2005	Absolutely loved the Pan Pacific	I have used trip advisor for several trips now and I have not been disappointed. I have found that you are the best source to find a hotel. My family and I were traveling to Yosemite and decided to stay three days in San Francisco. It was a hard decision to make but after reading your reviews decided on the Pan Pacific in San Francisco. What a wonderful decision. The hotel' s location is great -- it is within walking distance of many many stores/shopping. It is a short distance (5 minute walk) to the cable cars, Chinatown (walking distance a little longer), if you are renting from Hertz I believe they will do that for you (at least I know they will return the car for a $5 fee), and many other restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They are also close to several drug stores and mini markets. The hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms were roomy for 2 adults and 2 children with 5 pieces of luggage. The service and concierge were exceptional and went out of their way to do extra things for us. I cannot say enough about this place and the people who are working there. After going to Yosemite and several others places we needed to return to San Francisco for our return flight home and wanted to stayed again at the Pan Pacific which we did. The concierge printed our boarding passes for our airline and even arranged for a cab to be downstairs at a certain time to take us to the airport. This hotel even offers free car service during certain times of the day and several times instead of a cab they offered us the car for our own use. We loved this hotel and its location and would definitely stay here again. Finally, although a little more in price I was able to go on the Pan Pacific web site and get an internet special for several nights. Even if you pay a little more for this hotel -- you get what you pay for!"
213,2107,"Jun 22 2005	Would stay there again	I just returned from my trip tp San Francisco and I must say the Pan Pacific hotel is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Everyone was friendly and the service was outstanding. The only downside is the location as it's in Union Square. However, it's a city, and like all city it's busy."
214,2107,"Jun 21 2005	Luxury Room -Not!	When seeing our room, that was standard, we decided to upgrade. Given choice of Deluxe or Luxury, we choose Luxury. Well, it was larger, but the bathroom was not as well equiped as the standard, no TV and smaller. Definately not worth the extra $50 per night. It took 30 minutes just to get a bucket of ice both evenings we were there. The room and beds were very comfortable, but for the price and service, I would try another hotel next time visiting San Francisco."
215,2107,"Jun 18 2005	Great hotelGreat price	I just spent a weekend at the Pan Pacific. Our room rate averaged $100. per night for a three day stay! The hotel was five star in all respects. I have stayed in many ultra luxury five star hotels, but have never experienced a better hotel for the money. The hotel has been recently rennovated and the rooms were clean and well appointed with a flat screen television and a second tv in the bathroom. The concierge and staff were great. We even got to use their complimentary limo a couple of times."
216,2107,"Jun 15 2005	Great Hotel Terrific deal	We stayed three nights. The hotel is in a top location off Union Square.If you like an active lobby with ornate furniture this is not for you. But if you like contemporary style, plush bathrooms, and attentive--but not stuffy--service, you'll like this. Everyone was friendly and helpful--door men, concierge, check-in, etc. Also, if you book by June 30 with Amex, you pay 1/2 price and the third night is free--essentially 3 nights for the price of one (rack rate)."
217,2107,"Jun 12 2005	Quiet class	Wonderful clean decor done with impeccable taste.Quiet rooms, no one bothers you, but everyone is available at a moments notice to help you. A complimentary hotel car is available to take guest to restaurants, plays, etc.Parking which is usually $42 a night was included in a recent special rate. Nice add-on."
218,2107,"Jun 1 2005	Service is wonderful!	After an exhausing two-week tour of northern California, we ended at the Pan Pacific. The attendants wouldn't hear of us touching our luggage, and were happy to return our rental car for us for a $5 charge. The reception desk (on the third floor of all places!) had a big bowl of fresh apples and they made us feel very welcome, and our luggage arrived almost immediately. The zen-like rooms were calming and relaxing. The bathroom, including a TV and phone, was something else---taking a bath became a must! They have a butler button which you push for any need (ice, more bathrobes, maps, pillow service, anything) which they cater to immediately. We had a bunch of stuff to ship and asked where we could find a shipping place--they took it, wrapped it, and shipped it for a nominal charge. We had to check our bags at the end of our trip (taking the red-eye home) and they were ready when we returned to catch the taxi to the airport which they were to call for us--except they gave us the hotel car (much, much nicer) for the taxi price, instead. I've been in service-oriented hotels before, but not like this. It was the perfect way to end our trip."
219,2107,"May 30 2005	Outstanding Hotel!	From the time we checked in, until checkout, the 4 days at the Pan Pacific was the highlight of a 10 day California vacation!Everyone was very helpful and efficient with always a friendly greeting, the best cocierge desk. Our large room was immaculate and very comfortable. The huge bathroom was fantastic, television and phone included!!We were very sad to leave. The location was the best! You will not be dissapointed in the Pan Pacific. Out of curiousity, as we were walking around the city, we checked out some other hotel properties that we were considering from Trip Advisor. Just from the greeting we received, or lack of, they did not even compare to the Pan Pacific."
220,2107,"May 14 2005 	Great Hotel for an AWESOME Price !!!	Where do I start? The Pan Pacific is one of the BEST hotels I've stayed at in San Francisco. Booked through Expedia for (I think) $140 a night for a Superior Room. Got at the hotel at about 2pm, and they checked me in early, which is great. Check-in was extremely quick. I also took an upgrade to a Pacific Suite for only $300 for my 4-night stay. I LOVED the suite I was upgraded to. Now about the suite: Opened the door and heard lovely jazz music. Walked in and saw the living room. Very nice TVs and Bose Clock Radios. Also a very nice first bathroom. I then opened up the sliding french doors to the bedroom. Great beds, not too soft and not too hard. Just right! Great desk with egronomic chair. The view was great but I could see some buildings. I woke up one morning to a guy staring straight into my room from across the street. He was pretty far away, so it's okay. Very nice master bathroom with a small but good television in it. Very nice overall!Now about the service:Service was very prompt. Didn't order any room service so I cannot comment on that. Conceriege was great. Asked for recommedations on good steakhouses and recommended the Morton's right down the street. Housekeeping was great too, as well as turndown service. Great doormen, all greeted me by name by the third night. Opened the door for me every time I stepped up to the hotel even if they were talking to someone else. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION:Those three words came to mind when I first came to the hotel. One block from Union Square, 6 blocks from Moscone Center (where my conference was being held), and restaurants right when you step out the door. 10% off Macy's Coupon when you check-in which is great. Starbuck's is only a block away which is EXCELLENT since I practically went there like every two hours. Walgreen's was about two blocks away, which is also EXCELLENT for getting soda, snacks, and other stuff. RESTAURANT:Went to the hotel's restaurant for three mornings in a row for their breakfast buffet. No omelet bar, but hey who needs that? Pretty good for the price.OVERALL:I really recommend this hotel to anyone coming to San Francisco. Great location and prices through Expedia."
221,2107,"Apr 25 2005	Top notch!	Rather than stay at the recommended chain hotel for the large conference I was attending, I chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews &amp; they were right on the mark, once again. I requested &amp; received a quiet room on a high floor - I could see the hills &amp; the Bay in the distance. The room was tasteful, comfortable &amp; clean, and the bed was outstanding. Firm, with a soft topper &amp; soft pillows &amp; a doublesheeted light down comforter. Just perfect. Terry robes, morning paper, pleasant and accommodating staff. Late one evening I had some trouble regulating the AC &amp; I called the front desk. Within 5 minutes, the engineer was there to fix it. It was a pleasure."
222,2107,Apr 19 2005	Perfect	Stayed at the Pan Pacific. My only advice to any readers of this site is : Stay there! I found this to be an excellent hotel in every respect. Beautiful accommodation and location could not be more convenient. On my next visit to S.F. I will stay there and if this hotel is not available I will change my travelling dates. Excellent - this hotel was a highlight of the holiday
223,2107,"Apr 5 2005	Relaxing Weekend in San Fran	We just returned from a very relaxing weekend in the city. I'm a frequent travler to San Fran and have stayed in many hotels all over the city and the Pan Pacific is one of my fav's. It's location is unbeatable - right off Union Square. It is a little less hetic being a block away from Union Square, but still very close, so within seconds you are in the middle of it all. I liked how the lobby was on the third floor; it made it very calm and away from the hustle of Post St. I enjoyed sitting by the fire in the lobby enjoying a drink. Our room was awesome, very large! The bed was wonderful, one of the best hotel beds. The bathroom was also awesome, with a separate shower and tub, all surrounded by black marble. All in all it was a great weekend shopping, relaxing, but the best part by far was the Pan Pacific."
224,2107,"Apr 5 2005	Nearly excellent hotel	We stayed five nights at the Pan, with a two-night break in the middle of our stay. After the first three nights, we agreed that the hotel was just missing the mark....it was almost excellent. We never felt &quot;welcomed&quot; when we checked in; the gentleman at the front desk simply wasn't friendly.The rooms are average size, but didn't feel cramped. The bathrooms are small, but ours had a separate tub/shower which was a nice touch. The bathrooms are beautifully appointed. The butler service is a nice touch. The hotel definitely does not want its guests doing for themselves--if you want ice, contact your butler to bring it, because it's not available at the end of the hall!There is a courtesy car service, which was one of the selling points for us. However, it is not available on Sunday, not available between 9:30a-5:30p, and doesn't go beyond a two-mile radius. Fisherman's Wharf was too far. In fact, we weren't able to use the &quot;courtesy&quot; car until we went to the airport, for which we paid a $45 fee.On our return for the last two nights, we had a more enjoyable check-in. We learned that the valet would return our rental car for a $5 fee (could be worth if if you don't want to deal with traffic). In the end, this is a very Japanese hotel--the staff was obedient; they reacted to our needs but didn't well anticipate them."
225,2107,"Mar 31 2005	Slept like a Baby	I bought 3 nights on Hotwire for $108 a night. I could not have afforded it otherwise. This is a four or five star hotel. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a junior suite at no extra charge. The bed had a pillow top and was marvelous. I slept like a baby. Our room had a flat screen tv and also a tv in the bathroom. The bathroom had a tub and a glass shower. The concierge was great, very knowledgeable and recommended some great restaurants as well as made our dinner reservations. The hotel is located in Union Square. So, it is walking distance to the trolley cars and shopping. I would definitely stay there again!!"
226,2107,"Mar 30 2005	Loved the Pan Pacific	We just returned from a weekend at the Pan Pacific...The hotel's location is fantastic!!.. with walking distance to Union Square. The Hotel is very elegant. The rooms are large and trendy..the bed was wonderful. The bathroom was small with very little counter space, but it is all marble and very chic. The room came with robes a nice touch. The service was also very prompt and professional from everyone. You can park across the street at a parking garage for $28.00 instead of the $45.00 the hotel charges for valet parking. All in all I would love to stay here again."
227,2107,"Mar 28 2005	Excellent Hotel	I have to say, I read all of the reviews in the Trip Advisor prior to my trip and had some concerns. My daughter and I stayed at the Pan Pacific Easter week, 2005. This hotel was incredible. The room, although not spacious, was clean, modern and the bathroom is incredible. The staff? EXTREMELY courteous, polite and helpful with EVERYTHING. The car available to guests is a great perk. I will definitely stay nowhere else but the Pan Pacific when visiting San Francisco again! Really!"
228,2107,"Mar 27 2005 	Luxurious base for hopping around the city!	I booked my Pan Pacific stay as part of a package deal on Expedia, as I was traveling there for a conference at the Moscone Center. My friends came, too, and they stayed in slightly nicer rooms (and paid handsomely for them) and we all had a terrific time at the Pan Pacific.Highlights include a fabulous bed, a gorgeous bathroom, a quiet stay and very good butler service. My room was a bit smaller than my friends' and on a lower floor but was nevertheless very comfortable, even though the furniture was just a bit worn and the windows were just a bit loose. The shower was a little too tiny and didn't get hot enough for my tastes, but the maid service was impeccable and I loved the room. It was quite a treat to stay at the Pan Pacific, too, because its location can't be beat. Highly recommended if you can get a good deal on a room, and be sure to explore the neighborhood--it's very touristy and very pricey, but then you don't come to SF to save money!"
229,2107,"Mar 26 2005	Great Hotel Great Location	Recently stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel and we loved it. The location is within walking distance of the cable car lines, Union Square, the Bart and Chinatown. The staff was wonderful, knowledgeable and very helpful.. The doorman even went out of his way to get us a nicer taxi,when we tried to use the towncar service and a towncar was not available. The rooms are wonderful, especially the beds which was almost more comfortable than home...We would highly recommend this Hotel, and will gladly stay again if we return to San Francisco..."
230,2107,"Mar 20 2005	Great location for San Francisco exploration	We just returned from a fabulous week in San Francisco. The Pan Pacific San Francisco is a terrific hotel in a great location. The hotel serves as a great base for exploration of the city. You see, San Francisco is a compact city that is best explored on foot. From the Union Square location of the Pan Pacific hotel, you can easily walk to Chinatown, North Beach, and even Fishermans Wharf.When you visit, make sure to ask the concierge for restaurant recommendations. Although it's easy to find many great restaurants in San Francisco, the Pan Pacific concierge offers a variety of restaurants that tourists wouldn't ordinarily find. Example: Jardiniere near the Civic Center. The concierge arranged for an anniversary dinner for my wife and I. This was one of the most enjoyable dinner experiences ever. Jardiniere is not a tourist restaurant with a view of the city. Instead they offer a fantastic meal served by people who pay attention to every detail.One additional word of advice for those visiting San Francisco: Bring your walking shoes! Have fun!"
231,2107,"Mar 19 2005	What a great hidden Treasure	I tend to stay at alot of hotels in SF, and I had always seen this hotel, and 1 day, decided to try it.The staff knocks you out......Very Friendly, wanting to make sure that you enjoyed your stay, and if there is anything they forgot. Rooms are nice, and a flat screen tv. I think what they have done with the TV's in the bathroom is a terrific idea. How nice to lay in a tub after a hard day and enjoy the tv.The resturant for lunch was nice. It's not a bad walk to the financial district, it took me 10 minutes and I sort of shopped on the way down."
232,2107,"Mar 16 2005	Another great experience	This is my favorite hotel I've ever stayed at. Once for my honeymoon last May 2004 and again this time in March 2005 on business. The rooms are spacious and minimalist. The beds are out of this world. The bathrooms are huge and include both a shower stall and bathtub with a TV in there to boot. Amazing service and a breathtaking view in the courtyard. The only downfall is the parking which is $47 a night. Then again, I got the room for $90 on Hotwire, so I can't complain. Overall, this is a perfect place."
233,2107,Mar 16 2005	great location; nice room	We stayed between Christmas and New Years. Got an amazing deal at Hotels. Room was very nice. Concierge was extremely helpful. Location was excellent. Parking was a rip-off. Park across the street for 1/3 the price. Also the front desk upon check in offered us a room upgrade - the &quot;upgrade&quot; had a view of a construction site. We asked for our Hotels room and it was a better view and just as nice a room (just a bit small). This is a great deal for SF if you get a discount room and park elsewhere.
234,2107,"Feb 2 2005	AWFUL HOTEL	I was looking forward to staying at this hotel after reading the reviews of it on Trip Advisor. I was never so disapointed in my life. For the price of this hotel I expected alot. I didn't get it. This hotel is not attractive in the least. The rooms were cold and sterile, all white, plain. The 2 beds in the room were tiny, not even doubles. They were each like a slightly bigger twin. The only nice thing was the bathroom. But how much time do you spend in there? The worst part of the trip was the bellhop pounding on our door at 1am, he said he was there to check us out and take our bags? I guess someone wanted to check out in the middle of the night, it wasn't us. The bellhop was confused so we called down to the front desk. They could care less, they didn't know what was going and frankly didn't seem to care. No apology, nothing. Also, parkiing was $42 per night plus 14% TAX. If you want a 5 star hotel experience in San Francisco go to the FAIRMONT, they know how to treat their guests right."
235,2107,"Jan 31 2005 	Not sure if I'd stay again	The location of this hotel can't be beat. It's right in the middle of it all and you can walk everywhere. However, I was unimpressed with the service. I was here with a group from work for the Builder Show last June, but the staff did not seem very hospitable. The only person who cracked a smile was one of the doormen. Other than that, don't expect much hospitality or warmth.The rooms were very spartan but the bathrooms were magnificent. I loved having the tv in the bathroom. Plus you had a separate tub and shower, though the shower was pretty small. The amenities were really nice too. But other than that the room was very basic and dull.Did not eat at the restaurant as it was very expensive. For a great meal walk down to Maxwells for a great meal at a great price."
236,2107,"Jan 26 2005	Loved it!	What a wonderful hotel. My husband and I were from the San Francisco area and recently moved to Hawaii. We were back for the holidays and stayed here right before Christmas and we loved it! The staff were so pleasant and greeted us each night when we came in. We felt like they went above and beyond to be pleasant. The location is close to all, near Union Square and close to good restaurants. I will definitely stay here again."
237,2107,"Jan 20 2005	An excellent hotel one block from Union Square	My Wife, Daughter and I stayed for 3 nights at the Pan Pacific in November and would rate this hotel very highly after staying at the Fairmont Orchid Hawaii and the Bellagio. The location is perfect for the shops (we found the Pier 39 area to be tacky) and the rooms are fantastic - spacious, with lcd tv, large windows and a huge bathroom with tv! We didnt eat in the hotel so cant comment on that but the staff were very friendly even though we were clearly one of the poorer guests! As I used tripadvisor to book all our hotels I thought I should share this with you - basically the tripadvisor reviews got it right in all of the hotels we stayed at!"
238,2107,"Jan 12 2005	Pan Pacific San Fransisco...a real home from home	My husband and I have just returned (10/01/05) from 14 nights at this hotel, it is not our first stay at this hotel, yet each visit is just a special stay.The staff are the most friendly, happy and informative you could hope to meet.The rooms (we received a free upgrade as frequent visitors) are spacious and very comfortable.The new flat screen plasma t.v's are excellant quality, as are the choices of channels and pay to view movies,also the BOSE radios are an excellant quality,being left on for you at a very low volumn,if you choose to ask for turndown, another free service. The bathroom is just dreamy,all marble with seperate tub and shower,I loved the miniture t.v. in the bathroom, a nice touch.The butler service is excellant and so quick to respond,with nothing being to much trouble.The location is perfect, half a block from Union Square,and right in the middle of some great theatres and restuarants,(try SEARS, just round the corner, to avoid the line of this popular restuarant for breakfast, you need to be there before 8:00a.m, but even if you are later, the line moves very quickly,lunch and dinner are equally as popular).If you fancy the theatre,try TICKET MASTER, located in Union Square for half price tickets,we managed to get tickets for every show we wished to see, all at half price.All in All an EXCELLANT HOTEL at the most excellant location where you are made to feel so welcome and everybody is so friendly."
239,2107,"Jan 8 2005	""Great stay - huge room - bathroom exemplary""	We stayed at the Pan Pacific for three nights and the room was huge, clean, and had all the amenities for a family of four. The bathroom was perfect with a separate shower and tub and the water pressure was great. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant to work with for directions and assistance. We would highly recommend this hotel to any family travelling to San Francisco. We have stayed at other smaller boutique type hotels and this by far will be where we come back to when we visit again."
240,2107,"Dec 30 2004 	Great location mediocre hotel...	The location of the Pan Pacific was excellent; however the hotel itself was very mediocre. The hotel is pretty dated. The rooms are nice, but I've seen much better for the price (we did get a screamin'deal on Hotwire of $127.00 per night, which made it adequate for the price) but I would not stay there again for the AAA book prices. The hotel has no panache at all, it is a very sanitary, lifeless hotel. The staff is courteous, when you can find them. The bar/lounge is a joke, and it is so quiet in there you feel like you are at a funeral viewing.When my wife and I do go back to the Union Square area, which we definitely will, we will stay at either the St. Francis, Hyatt, or other which we have had much better stays.Added tip, do NOT eat at Asia de Cuba, which is the restaurant in the Clift Hotel. The food was extremely overpriced, $100+ per person for very small portion and no drinks, and the service was the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. The food really was not all that good either, I would give the food 1 star out of 5--Panda Express has better asian food."
241,2107,Dec 28 2004	Great hotel!... Skip restraunt for dinner!!!!	Location/Great Staff/GREAT!Rooms &amp; Bath/Great: (clean &amp; neat)Restraunt(Pacific)/ SKIP for Dinner
242,2107,Dec 20 2004	Great Hotel - Near Everything	Our 5th stay in San Francisco (normally stay at Handlery). Hotel is very impressive and is in a great location. Only criticism would be parking is very very expensive. Whatever you save on internet booking is taken by parking charges. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and room was spacious and clean. Would stay again but have soft spot for the Handlery.
243,2107,"Dec 14 2004	I'd stay again	Stayed one very short night, and I'd stay again. Rooms are quiet, and with windows that open (yay!), and the bathrooms are gorgeous. The coffee-makers are great, with disposable filter trays instead of the never-quite-clean filter cones you usually find. The reservation folks told me that the standard fluff level of pillows, for those of you who are interested, is &quot;soft&quot;, but &quot;firm&quot; can be provided on request. I found the pillows fairly firm, but hey, I was glad just to have feather pillows at all. Room heating works great, and very quick. The glass elevators allowing you to see the many levels of the atrium-style floors, is a lot of fun. Wake-up call was on time.Why not 5 stars? Found 3 hairs in the bathtub, but I cleaned the tub quickly myself, and hopped in. There were some very large stains on the what-do-you-call-that-thing - the ruffle hanging down from the bed to the floor, and some on the wall near it. When I called with questions about the BART and the airport, twice, the folks answering were fairly abrupt (and incorrect). My husband was quoted a price by the doormen for the hotel car to the airport, but when he called to book he was given the run around, plus a much higher price. Then he was told &quot;first come, first serve&quot; and he said fine, we had to be at the airport for 5 a.m...then it was suddenly no longer possible (even though nobody else was booked).But overall, I was happy with the hotel."
244,2107,"Dec 4 2004	A top hotel in SanFran	My family and I stayed at the Pan San Francisco in late August. Two adults and two children. It was a great stay; we highly recommend the hotel. We had a leisure package, I think, and upgraded to a very large suite, with two bathrooms and a pull out couch. Although the room really did not have much of a view (I don't think many rooms in SF do, perhaps I'm wrong), that is the only thing the room was lacking. The decor was Asian minimalist, with cool color tones, flat screen TVs, a terrific bed and a large marble bathroom with large tub, separate shower and all the amenities. The hotel also has pvt butler service. Essentially, you flip a switch and someone answers quickly, asking what you need. Its a great gimmick. Hotel's location is perfect, about a block from Union Square. A number of good mid priced restaurants closeby. The staff at the hotel was uniformly good, particularly the concierges. They exceeded expectations. Always had good recommendations and actually appeared concerned that we were happy. Same with the door men and front desk. The hotel offers a Town Car to drive you where you want later in the afternoon/evening. Again, a very nice touch. On the downside, the Pan does not have a pool, if that is something you are looking for. We looked into a number of other hotels and thought the Pan was the best selection. Many others appeared over loaded with tours or consisted of oversized lobbies with lots of tourists looking around aimlessly. The Pan is much more intimate. San Fran is a terrific city. Make sure you visit Alcatraz and book ahead. The Pan's concierge did so for us, I had called ahead. The trip to Alcatraz consistently sells out so, if you don't reserve ahead you are likely out of luck. I am a relatively jaded New Yorker and I thought the audio tour of the prison and the facility itself was tops, very memorable. The kids loved it. Also, take the short drive to Muir Woods. Huge redwoods, worth seeing - before they are cut down. The city has some excellent food, especially Asian and the people were very open. I compare it to NYC, without the attitude. Although as one reviewer wrote the hotel is predominantly a business hotel, I would not let that impact your decision if you are a family. The property is top notch, great service and great location. The kids loved it and would return in a minute, as would we which, in our house, is the test of a good hotel."
245,2107,"Nov 30 2004	Good Room Great Location But Oh So Soulless!	We stayed here for the last three nights of our 11 day tour of the US. Lovely room - a Luxury King - very spacious and airy, simple decor, LCD TV (although not the best quality, to be fair) and Bose radio. Bathroom was quite 'glitzy' with lots of marble and a baby TV, but was perhaps a little cramped.Room was cleaned well every day and same-day laundry was returned to us as required.We used the complimentary car to take us to dinner one night, which was a really nice touch. We used it again, at a cost of $45, to take us to the airport - very good value compared to using a cramped taxi, and the driver was great.However, in my honest opinion this had to be the most soulless hotel I have ever stayed in - especially in the Pacific Bar. Located within the lobby, it was as if every last shred of atmosphere had been sucked out of it by an industrial vacuum. The staff were robotic, the setting sterile and one's fellow bar flies appeared to consist solely of disillusioned travelling businessmen. The restaurant, which we'd planned on trying prior to our stay, never had more than three of four diners in it and the staff in there looked bored to tears.For our evening tipple we wandered up Nob Hill to the Mark Hopkins - a proper cocktail bar with music, lively staff and a fantastic view. Might be tempted to stay here next time.Having said that, there was one big thing in the Pan Pac's favour - it wasn't hit by the 'striking' hotel staff in the same way as some of the larger hotels, so at least you didn't have to cross a picket line to get to your room on a night!This is definitely a business hotel, despite the 'Leisure' packages that it touts. As tourists we felt a little isolated here."
246,2107,"Nov 25 2004	Great Hotel	We spent four nights here in November 2004. This is a very, very good hotel. Helpful staff, excellent rooms and a great central location in the heart of San Francisco. The only negative aspect is the valet parking charge - $45 per night including tax! You can get a decent motel room for this price! The fact is you don't need a car in San Francisco which is small enough to explore on foot or cable car. We would definitely return to this hotel which, overall is great value for money."
247,2107,Nov 22 2004	Great Hotel!	This is a top-notch hotel operated with great attention to detail. From the moment I arrived I was greeted with warmth. The free apples at the reception desk was a nice touch. My room was very comfortable. I was impressed with the Bose wave radio and the LCD flat panel TV. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel is in a very convenient location close to the cable car line and shopping.
248,2107,"Nov 18 2004	Great hotel; good location	My husband and I were at the Pan Pacific Hotel for 2 nights, 11/13-11/14. The room was nice, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, you could hear the people out in the hall as we were going to our room, but it was very quiet once we got in our room. The people at the front desk were very helpful, Kyle the concierge giving us great suggestions for dinners, and good directions. The cable cars are just a couple of blocks away. I compared hotels read the reviews before I picked the Pan Pacific, then right before we were going to leave on our trip I read a couple of reviews that were not very good and I was a little concerned. But after staying, we were not disappointed. We would definitely stay again."
249,2107,"Nov 14 2004	The Pan-Terrific Hotel	After working for a company that measures customer satisfaction, I've found that I have become very picky when it comes to customer service in hotels and restaurants. The Pan Pacific truly surprised me with its hospitality and charm.I made my reservation for one room (2 double beds) through Expedia, who offered a 20% discount per night if you stayed for two or more nights. However, after staying in this 4-star hotel for 6days/5nights, Id gladly stay again and pay the full rate. The bellhops and front desk staff were genuinely friendly, and the concierge desk was VERY helpful (especially Andrea). They were able to give us clear, concise directions to everything we wanted to see and do, and even recommended an excellent day spa close to the hotel.Every member of the hotels staff seemed happy to be there. The doormen always remembered who we were and asked how our day-trips were: &quot;How was dinner at XYZ Restaurant? How was Fishermans Wharf?&quot; They even provided one of the hotels town cars at a discounted rate when my co-worker and I were trying to get to a conference near the airport.The rooms were simple, but spacious. I loved the marble bathroom and the seemingly over-sized tub. I only heard our rowdy neighbors once, but the front desk was quick to quiet them down. The beds and pillows were SO comfortable  I had a hard time sleeping in my own bed once I got home!Overall, this was probably the best hotel experience I've ever had. It is not one of the 14 hotels in the area that are on strike (see aboutsfmeg for a list), and is far enough away from any of them not to be bothered by it.The only downside was the Pacific restaurant on the third floor. The food was overpriced and bland, and the service, well, rivaled only that of a fast-food restaurant. Try Sears Fine Foods around the corner for good, home-cooked meals at a decent price."
250,2107,"Nov 11 2004	it was awful	The pan pacific. where to even begin. I went to visit colleges in the san francisco area. However, many of my plans were cut short due to the awful service of the pan pacific sanfran. They gave me the wrong information for bus and train times, bart times and directions. This bad information caused me to miss an cancel many appointments i made weeks ago at stanford, berkeley and real estate agents. They promised to compensate for my troubles by providing a free stay for the weekend. although they made this promise i never received any compensation. So my trip all the way to san francisco from boston was a waste of time and money because of the atrocious staff and organization of the pan pacific."
251,2107,"Nov 5 2004	large room minimal service dated a/c TV didn't work	Thankfully, my deal on hotwire meant a substantially lower price than is listed on this page. The room itself was nice and large, with a decent view. However, the air conditioner was an old wall unit, that they had simply stuck a programable thermostat on. It was either on or off, and it would take about 20 minutes to reach the desired temperature, and when it was on, it was loud - one speed only. Then the TV didn't work, a guy came up and worked on it for 20 minutes, it worked for a while and then stopped again. The service at the front desk was also slow, with very minimal customer interaction, and the valets didn't open your door, help with bags or anything, so no tip needed there. All in all, a nice location with decent larger rooms, but if detail and service is big on your list, keep looking."
252,2107,"Oct 31 2004	Great Stay!	My wife and I stayed here for two nights from 10/10-10/12/04. We flew to Oakland, then rented a convertible and started in San Fran and drove down Pacific Coast Highway to LA. First off, let me recommend doing this. We took a week, and it was incredible. That's another story. As far as the Pan Pacific is concerned, we stayed during the middle of the hotel worker's strike. I had done a LOT of research while I was in Afghanistan on places to stay in SF prior to coming out there. I had considered several other hotels. The majority of those hotels, it so happened, were surrounded day and night by angry and disgruntled hotel union employees, banging with sticks and shouting into megaphones. Not so at the Pan Pacific. Plus one for them. I'll just be brief in this review. The place is pricey, but great. You will not be disappointed. We got a room upgrade for a reasonable price when we first checked in. The rooms are beautiful. It's kind of like post-modern Japanese minimalism. Very light colors, high quality furniture. Lots of marble. The open air atrium is very classy, and the service is top notch. The staff are friendly and professional, and the hotel is pretty much in the center of everything. The bed was incredibly soft, and the decor was elegant. A few gripes - the valet service (which they do not inform you of at the time of your check in) is $39 per night. Kind of pricey. You also won't get the best views at this hotel. No worries, it can't be helped sometimes as SF has so many hills. In addition, though Union Square is in the middle of the city, we found ourselves spending a lot more time towards the wharf area. There aren't that many attractions - aside from shopping and restaurants - that are in Union Square. All in all, though, we'd definitely go back and stay. I've traveled quite a bit with my job, and I have to stay this is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. You pay for it, but it is nice."
253,2107,"Sep 22 2004	Very nice stay here	We stayed at the Pan Pacific Labor Day weekend. No complaints at all. Excellent staff and location. Walking distance to Union Square, the trolley, train services and SBC park and tons of great shopping. A cab ride to the Wharf was about $30 US. Took the K line train back and the money thing was not working so we rode back for free-so we saved $2. Cab ride to North Beach was also around $30. If you like Thai food. Walk out of the hotel door and go to your right. About a block up on the left is an awesome place, small and not flashy, but the food was great. Would stay at the Pan Pacific again. Enjoy!"
254,2107,"Sep 20 2004	Location and Service!	Great room and perfect view! The location, service and ambience of the hotel were great! So close to Union Sq and Chinatown. The view from the 16th floor was amazing...especially at night. The trip was a surprise for my girlfriend and she also loved the hotel!"
255,2107,"Sep 1 2004	Great Room and Great Staff	Spent two nights in San Francisco and the Pan Pacific helped make our visit great. The room was excellent (large bathroom, LCD TV, comfy bed, clean, access to their limo shuttle) and the staff went out of their way to help us. Pan Pacific's concierge are one of the best I've ever encountered... personable, great dinner recos, arranged custom limo trips, and on personal time went to Ticketmaster to purchased concert tickets for us. Couldn't ask for more (except cheaper drinks in the lobby bar)."
256,2107,"Aug 14 2004	A real steal if you can get a discounted rate	I booked a standard king size bed room at a steeply discounted rate that I found on Orbitz. The place was great for San Francisco given the rate I got. The location can't be beat: it is on Union and Mason, just a block or so from Union Square, and the hotel is just far enough off of Powell Street that is was not noisy at all at night or in the mornings. Check in was a snap, and the staff was very helpful, starting with the desk clerk and then with the concierge, whom we asked for directions and ideas. The rest of the service was just fine. I particularly liked the fact that there were bellmen and doormen at the street level always available to be helpful. Maid service was just fine. We never tried to use the two services that the hotel hypes so much: the pillow selection or the valet service.My only complaint is that a hotel of this category really should offer turndown service in the evening. We had to hunt through the small print of the hotel service directory after the first night to learn that this service is available, but only on requrest.The standard room was very nicely furnished. It was of a decent size given San Francisco room standards. The robe and umbrella were a nice touch. The marble bathrooms were really beautiful and I liked the safe in the closet. Water pressure in the showers was fine. No view from our room, but who cares in this city when you are out all day, and the rate was so reasonable after shopping around that the price was great.My only constructive criticism of the place relates to its layout and security. You can take the elevator right from street level to your room without stopping at the lobby on the third floor and changing elevators. This is a nice change from many hotels that prevent this by making you stop in the lobby. The down side of this is that anyone can walk into the hotel and go directly up the elevator to the guest floors without anyone asking or checking to see if they are hotel guests. I would feel better if there was some way to prevent people from coming off the street and all the way upstairs.Despite this, we had a great 3 days at a beautiful facility. While this hotel is not in the top tier of luxury like a Ritz, Four Seasons, etc. It is a very nice hotel at the next level down, and a real steal if you can book a room at a steeply discounted price like I did."
257,2107,"Aug 10 2004	A First-Rate Stay	I recently stayed at the Pan Pacific for the 3rd time. While that statement may speak for itself, I would like to share some of the more attractive features. The location is excellent, with Union Square shopping only a block away, and Fisherman's Wharf a short trolley/taxi ride. The rooms themselves are even better, especially for the money. Yes, it will probably cost you $120-$150/night, plus an additional $20 or so for parking, BUT it is highly dependable, and an all-around excellent hotel. I have paid more money to stay at far lesser hotels, and I would rank the Pan-Pacific with some that cost double or triple its room prices. The bedrooms themselves are fairly spacious, with high-quality sheets and bedding--something that really does make a difference in your night's sleep. The bathrooms are sumptuous, with marble floors, sinks, shower, etc., and very spacious. Plenty of shelf space as well. And the rooms are fairly quiet, even on a lower floor. Although we didn't indulge, the in-room entertainment is extensive, with your choice of dozens of movies, CDs on demand, digital music channels, internet access, or games for kids (though nothing is less than $10). An ironing board and steam iron also proved useful when I didn't have time to take advantage of the hotel's pressing and cleaning services. The lobby is quite impressive, and the service is excellent--I twice left my parking stub in the car, but the staff had no problem finding my car and bringing it up even before I was ready. The concierge was knowledgeable and quite helpful in procuring hard-to-get tickets to a popular play. If I had any nitpicks, I'd probably say the breakfast in the lobby restaurant and drinks in the bar were overpriced, though certainly everything tasted just fine. I have stayed at other hotels in the area, and I keep coming back to the Pan-Pacific. I hope to keep coming back for many years to come."
258,2107,Jul 12 2004	Great Place To Stay	Stayed 2 nights at the Pan Pacific. The room was elegant and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Convenient location. Would happily stay there again. Loved the tv in the bathroom.
259,2107,"Jun 19 2004	Luxury and service in SF	We started staying at the Pan Pacific 15 years ago on our Honeymoon night. Every once in a while we try a different hotel in SF and are dissapointed and go back to Pan Pacific. The rooms are typical size for SF but the luxury is there in every room. It is not only clean and beautiful, but the service is perfect and we stay there probably 4 or 5 times a year and it is always consistent. I am a very picky traveler and this hotel fits the bill. If you stay here you won't be disspointed."
260,2107,"Jun 13 2004	Pan Pac the SF Landmark	The Pan Pac is a stately bastion for elite travelers. Expect to pay $150-$300 for a room which is on the higher end. Of course, the rooms are higher end. They range from 300 sqaure feet to over 400 square feet. Each is well appointed with comfortable beds (Duvets), large bathrooms with separate tubs and quality furnishings. Service is at a high standard and the staff are warm. Several rates permit a suite upgrade for $50 a night. I recommend this. My suite last stay was larger than most SF apartments probably 1000 square feet and on a corner. Public areas are nice and expect high prices at the bar and restaurant both of which are fairly good.Take advantage of the location and get out into SF. Try Sanraku for sushi on Sutter about 2 blocks away, I never miss it."
261,2107,"May 26 2004	Don't overlook this gem	My wife and I stayed here 2 nights for our anniversary. Booked it through Hotwire for $100 a night, which was a really good deal for this place. The room wasn't huge but had an awesome bed, an LCD TV, Bose clock radio, etc. Apparently that's standard with every room. The bathroom was also incredible. Marble walls and floors, color TV with remote, phone, separate shower stall. Everyone we interacted with was extremely helpful and nice. They have a courtesy car that will take you anywhere downtown during the morning or evening hours (you're on your own getting back). Hotel is just a block from Union Square and the Cable Cars. Hertz and Thrifty across the street too, which was handy. We would definately stay here again."
262,2107,"May 20 2004	A unique hotel who's great staff makes all the difference	While some may view the Pan Pacific as more of a business oriented luxury hotel, I would like to cast a different light... Due to unusual circumstances, my girlfriend and I now find ourselves on opposite sides of the continent. Meeting up is a big event, and we had planned a trip to San Francisco. I poured over the reviews and pricing in attempts to find a luxury hotel that would fit our style without devastating my wallet. The comments made by previous guests often referred to the attentiveness of the Pan Pacific. Attention to detail by the staff was said to be on par with the Ritz Carlton. After finding a reasonable rate online, I booked a reservation for two nights in a &quot;Superior Queen&quot;. The first night of our stay also happened to fall on my girlfriends birthday. I contacted the reservation department at the Pan Pacific and let them know the special circumstances surrounding our stay. Arrival: The Pan Pacific was located right in the heart of Union Square. Plenty of shopping and public transportation to get you around (it was nice not to worry about parking $$$). The main lobby is gorgeous, with an ornate statue and a view all the way up to the roof skylight. Twin glass elevators shuttle you to and from your floors. Very classy without being too swanky. We arrived earlier than our check-in time, with baggage in hand. We were given a warm and friendly welcome and I was addressed by name frequently. I was a bit disappointed that they did not acknowledge my girlfriends birthday. They happily checked our baggage in and told us our room would be ready shortly. We returned in an hour and I realized that my initial disappointment was a bit premature as the receptionist proceeded to wish her a very happy birthday. She then informed us that we would be upgraded to a suite. I was beaming to say the least. The bellhop then showed us to our room. He was smiling and courteous and insisted that we use our personal valet service (a switch on the wall that when flipped,notifies your personal valet to call) you when flipped should we require the least bit of assistance. The room: PERFECT! Everything about the room just screamed class. It was absolutely spotless. Carpets were brand new, and the linens were gleaming white. The suite was cavernous by my standards. The bathroom was all marble, with recessed lighting, and separate bath and shower. The vanity had a full size mirror, makeup mirror, various appliances, and even a TV. There was an elegant circular glass table in the dining area. The TV by the bed was sufficiently large, but not so big as to block the window. We were graced with a corner room on the 18th floor, and each of the large half-moon windows provided wonderful views of the city. Again, I can't stress enough how clean the room was. Everything looked brand new. The style could be best described as minimalistic. Neutral colors and not overly ornate and gaudy. I could definitely see the Eastern influence. Very eye pleasing and calming. The feather bed was the most comfortable I had ever laid on. In fact, just sitting there for a moment made a nap seem very tempting. As I was giving into temptation, there was a knock at the door... The service: Upon answering the door, I see that the valet has brought us a bottle of complementary champagne. I am so far above satisfied at this point that it's hard to put into words. My girlfriend seemed VERY happy, and so was I. After being persuaded out of my nap, we decided to explore the city a bit. Not knowing exactly how to get around, we thought we'd talk to hotel information. The concierge was both friendly and knowledgeable. She showed us the trolley car and bus routes, let us know what we would have to pay, and even penciled routes on a map. What a great city. After a long day, I slept like a baby in the feather bed and awoke with a huge appetite. My girlfriend thought it would be fun to order room service. Though ridiculously expensive, I have to admit that it was a great idea. The breakfast menu was varied enough so that we could both get exactly what we wanted. She picked out an omelette while I mulled over getting a Belgian waffle. Alfonso (I wish I could remember more employee names) took our order over the phone and embodied exactly what I loved about the Pan Pacific. His friendliness and sincerity was infectious. He greeted me by name, wished me good morning, complemented my choices, then asked if there was anything else that he could do for us. Without prompting, he let me know precisely when the food would arrive. As promised, breakfast arrived in 20 minutes. The gentleman who delivered the food made sure that everything was to our liking and even offered to setup the meal on the glass table. He made sure to ask if everything was how we wanted it before he left. The food was delicious, and it was obviously all made from scratch. After breakfast, we lounged for a while into the afternoon. Breakfast, combined with towels and gift-wrap made quite a mess. Housekeeping had skipped our room because of the DND on the door. I called to let them know we would be gone for the afternoon, and they happily agreed to schedule a room tidying. When we returned that night, the room was as clean as it appeared upon check-in. We felt ashamed that they had even gone to the length of picking up a multitude of packing peanuts from one of the corners of the room. Once again, I was very impressed. The next morning, we were obviously very sad to leave. The room had become very comfortable, and I felt myself becoming accustomed to this level of pampering. Checkout was quick and painless. I received a genuine thank you for my choice to stay at the Pan Pacific. I should have been the one thanking them. I will be returning."
263,2107,"Apr 23 2004	Gorgeous... but expensive	I stayed at the Pan Pacific with my family in the summer of 2003. We took advantage of the Leisure Package and uprgraded to a Junior Suite; a huge room with a living area, dining area, separate bedroom, foyer, and two full bathrooms. The cost? $275 a night. Yes, the service was wonderful. Yes, the location is ideal. Yes, the room was beautiful. But would I pay that much again for a $275 (plus taxes and tips... so many tips...) taste of luxury? Of course I would. I forgot to mention the complimentary limo service. A must stay in San Francisco."
264,2107,"Feb 25 2004	Very expensive 3-star hotel	Rooms are completely basic and the atmosphere is unremarkable. The Pan Pacific is still a good place to stay if you get a cheap promotional rate, but in no way does it justify the price tag of a 5-star luxury hotel, because it isn't one. Also be warned of the ludicrious daily parking charge."
265,2107,"Feb 23 2004	Not what it used to be	I stayed at the Pan Pacific in 1997 and was thrilled. Unfortunately, they have not updated anything since then. The hotel looks dated and the carpet in my room was very worn. The bathroom was dark and needed to be re-caulked. The wait for the elevator was long at times. You can get a much better bang for your buck than this in SF."
266,2107,"Jan 27 2004	Phenomenal Hotel!	My husband and I have stayed in a lot of great hotels around the world, and this one ranks at the top. We paid nearly nothing (on hotwire) and were amazed. The beds were fantastic, thick down comforters, soft down pillows. The bathroom was all marble, with an extra tv and phone. There was a large mirror surrounded (scary) tub to relax in, and a glass enclosed shower stall. Plenty of beautiful glass shelving to hold all of your toiletries and fresh flowers to complete the look. We were pleased that the hotel has wireless internet access for a very resonable price, and also has a business center for faxing, photo copying and printing. The hotel's limo service even droped us off at dinner one night. The staff bent over backwards to accomodate us. The bell hop was going to give us (for free) his extra tickets to pac bell park, but we already had our own. The location is unbeatable, and the views from the rooms are great. I promise you will not be dissapointed, this hotel is as good as they come."
267,2107,"Jan 20 2004	Way overrated...	Expensive property with a nice lobby. I stayed in a corner room that was in need of a renovation - I was told the entire hotel is soon to receive new carpets, etc. High speed internet did not work, I was told no refund, since the provider is a 3rd party company. No coffee service in room, unless I want to pay $25/night....When you want a nice place to stay, go a few blocks away and choose the Monaco - a truly great hotel."
268,2107,"Jan 6 2004	Good but for the price not great	My husband, myself, our daughter and her friend stayed in a suite at the Pan Pacific in San Francisco/Union Square from January 1 to January 4, 2004.First impression - the lobby was quiet and beautiful. The girls loved the elevator - quick.Check-in - quick and painless. Read about but were not asked about our pillow preference.Suite - the decor was understated but nice. There were 2 baths - one with a shower and one in the main bedroom with a shower, seperate tub, and tv. The bathrooms were beautiful. The robes were huge and comfortable and plenty of towels. The toiletries were nice and there was a blow dryer in the master bath.Complaint 1 - the hotel knew there were 4 people staying in the room but the room was only prepared for 2. When we called to request the sofabed be made up we also requested extra pillows for the sofabed and were told to check the main bedroom closet for extra pillows. I was a little put off that after spending $275 a night I had to justify a request for more pillows. At this time they did ask our pillow preference - feather, foam, or firm.Complaint 2 - the room was nice but it was a little surprising to see electrical gray tape holding down the telephone lines.Complaint 3 - we traveled with kids so my husband was in the bedroom watching tv and the kids were in the living area watching tv. Even with the panel doors closed the tvs competed against each other.Complaint 4 - when the car was brought up front at checkout, the doormen did not assist us with loading our luggage.Complaint 5 - the minibar was not restocked every day.Complaint 6 - our room rate included either free parking which at $39 a day is a nice plus or 2 free breakfasts for adults. We decided to forego the breakfasts and utilize the free parking instead. At checkout we had to remind the desk that this was included in our rate and that we had not eaten breakfast at the hotel.The complaints seem picky but I think that a luxury hotel like the Pan Pacific should have wowed us and they didn't. It was nice but not great. I don't know, maybe we expected too much but I think one of the &quot;leading hotels in the world&quot; should offer leading service.The location of the hotel is wonderful if you're looking for access to Union Square. We were able to walk to the main trolley lines, the wonderful SF stores, quite a few restaurants, and you can even walk to Chinatown if you're up to it.Next time we'll probably try the Fairmont instead."

1,2111,Nov 18 2009 	Nice little Hotel	Nice little 3 star hotel on Pacific Heights. Rooms are big and some have a very nice view. The included breakfast was disappointing. Just accros the street is a very nicy daily with nice breakfast and lunch.
2,2111,"Oct 28 2009 	Comfortable and Accommodating	The Laurel Inn is in a great location on the corner of California and Presidio, a pleasant area with good restaraunts. (they do offer a continental breakfast as well as lemonade and cookies in the afternoon).The staff was helpful upon check in/out. Our room had two double beds with comfortable bedding and pillows. We had a nice view of the city from our room. Parking is not free,(not unusual) but we had the comfort of knowing our vehicle was in a safe garage and could access it easily. We would definently return to the Laurel Inn."
3,2111,"Oct 14 2009 	Great location plus peaceful and quiet	We stayed at the Laurel the first weekend of October during the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass fest in Golden Gate Park. We don't drive in San Francisco, but rather purchase the 3 day MUNI passes for $18; the Laurel Inn is the ideal jumping off spot for getting around the city, with bus stops in every direction from the Presidio/California Street intersection. Located in the Pacific Heights/Western Addition general area, amidst lots of residential housing, the Laurel Inn lacks the 24/7 sirens and traffic noise of Union Square and other popular areas. We had their complimentary breakfast one morning, and it worked, but we preferred Ella's across the street. We had a city view room and found it of adequate size with a very nice view. Friendly, helpful staff. We've already booked a return visit for next October!"
4,2111,Oct 11 2009 	Good Value!	We stayed for four nights in September. We did a lot of research prior to booking and were looking forward to the complimentary WiFi internet access and breakfast. The hotel did not disappoint. It was located conveniently to public transportation. The staff was helpful with lunch/dinner recommendations. We would definitely stay there again on a return trip. Good value!
5,2111,"Sep 14 2009 	Very Nice Boutique Hotel	Agree with other comments about this little hotel. Small yes, but does the job fairly well. Friendly staff, nice complimentary continental breakfast in mornings and snacks in the afternoon. The rooms are a good size although, the mattress could have been a bit better. The bathroom was clean and functional although nothing to write home about. Aside from the nice quaint feel a major plus is that it is right across the street from the new JCC which has an amazing fitness center with gym, pool, hottub, sauna, etc. They charge a few bucks for a daily pass but for the business traveller who has a lot of free time in the eveing and isn't interested in hanging out at a hotel bar, the availabity of having such a great workout facility literally across the street is gold."
6,2111,"Aug 17 2009 	Customer Service Outstanding	The Laurel Inn was a lovely hotel. The neighborhood was great. Lots of places to eat and shop within walking distance. The chocolate chip cookies and lemonade where a nice treat after a day of sightseeing. The staff was friendly and helpful. There was a problem with our reservation and because the hotel was booked we couldn't get the room we reserved . After we got home on Saturday, we received an email survey asking about our stay. We explained our disappointment in not receiving the room we requested and by 9:00 am Monday morning, we had a personal reply by John Spear, GM apologizing and making it right. He not only apologized for our inconvenience but explained the steps taken to remedy the problems. This type of excellence customer service is rare and should be rewarded.We can't want for our next trip to San Francisco to visit the Laurel Inn and plan on visiting some of the other JDV properties."
7,2111,"Aug 14 2009	Great SF neighborhood to eat shop and walk	The Laurel Inn is in a super location, many good restaurants nearby, i.e. Ella's across California St. is excellent for breakfast, lunch, and homemade bread. Sacramento Street is fun shopping (esp. &quot;Goodbye's&quot; consignment clothing for women and men nearby). The hotel is smallish, nicely decorated room, and the Joie de Vivre Hotels touch of style and class. The free breakfast is very good, above average quality of pastries, plain yogurt, etc. Many rooms have nice kitchens, and are quite comfortable. I would definitely return."
8,2111,"Aug 8 2009 	Highest Customer Service and Excellent Accomodation	After recovering from a double-lung transplant, and being required to be near UCSF for two months post-surgery, I chose to stay at the Laurel Inn Hotel for my recooperation. There I experienced a kind, compassionate, professional staff that took the extra steps to provide excellent customer satisfaction and service. Whether that meant providing an extra refrigerator (for my many required medications) and furniture in our room (for a lengthy stay), the staff always came through for us with positive attitudes and cheerful smiles under the direction of John Spear (the manager). The staff daily stocked our kitchenette unit with appropriate cooking iimplements (my mother, my 24/7 caregiver, cooked great home-cooked meals in our room). And the daily freshly baked cookies and lemonade served in the Laurel Inn lobby were delicious! I can't express enough how such a genuinely caring staff attitude and the excellent service they provided contributed to such a positive recovery and outcome for me!  Also, public transit (UCSF shuttle and Muni) are convenienttly close (within walking distnce) if one chooses that route. So are grocery supplies, shopping, quaint restaurants, a theatre, and shops. Covered parking is adequate (with security camera protection). The Swank Club (for social events/gatherings) attached to the Laurel Inn has friendly, attentive service. I highly recommend the Laurel Inn for a positive experience with quality, and exceptional care!!"
9,2111,"Aug 8 2009 	""The Laurel Inn"" - Our home away fromn home!	The Laurel Inn became our home away from home from April 4th to May 21st, 2009 after our Daughter had a bilateral Lung Transplant (at UCSF). John Spear, the manager, and his staff treated our daughter Cindy great with anything she needed to make her stay more comfortable (ex. bringing in an extra Refrigerator for her many medications, extra furniture, the kitchenette well stocked with cookware dishes and eating utensils, paper towels, cloth dish towels, sponges, fresh morning coffee packets for the coffee maker, microwave, toaster, overall cleaniness etc.). I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes friendly, respectful, caring and genuinely kind treatment. The daily fresh cookies and lemonade in the lobby were our afternoon ritual. The covered parking garage (including handicapped) was ample (with security cameras). We were so happy we found this charming hotel and professional staff for the recovery of our daughter Cindy, and highly recommend it. Patricia , Pleasanton, Ca"
10,2111,"Aug 5 2009 	Definitely a good value for San Fran	I booked at the Laurel Inn to cover the Olympic torch protests and was expecting many hotels to be full, but was able to get a city view king room at a reasonable rate. It's not really a hotel for traveling on business -- the desk chair was more decorative and was painful after a while -- but the room was comfortable, roomy, modern and an imaginative use of an older building. The staff here are extremely friendly and helpful. You're removed from many of the attractions of S.F. if you're a tourist, but it's a short cab ride downtown (and the staff will gladly call one for you). The neighborhood is extremely quiet -- so quiet that there were no places open to get a bite to eat when I got back to the hotel each night. But the desk clerk had a folder stuffed with delivery menus for me to peruse (I recommend Mozzarella di Bufala). About parking: Don't try parking on the ground level where you pull in to check in. Drive around the block after you check in and park in the small garage under the hotel -- you'll still have direct access, with your room key, to the elevator to bring everything up. (And don't complain about paying for parking -- that's San Fran, and theirs is a very reasonable rate for a safe lot.) I never had time for the breakfast each morning, but it smelled good and looked like it was getting cleaned out pretty quickly."
11,2111,"Jul 16 2009 	Hidden gem for reasonably priced stay for S.F. meetings	Just stayed at the Laurel Inn, and it continues to be easily the greatest value for popping into San Francisco for a few days to attend a conference or meetings. Comfortable, nice staff, great restuarants in the area, etc., but lots of S.F. hotels have that. It's the ease-of-logistics that keep me coming back - you can self park your rental car on site, take your time getting organized once you park, no hassels with expensive valets or grungy parking lots / structures. Just be sure to get a parking placard from the front desk to place in the car. Another hint - It's West on California at Presidio, but to get their easily just take Van Ness towards the GG Bridge, go one light AFTER California to Sacramento St., which has a left hand turn lane, and take Sacramento all the way to Presdio, turn left on Presidio, and you're there."
12,2111,"Jul 16 2009 	Dog-friendly and easy parking	We've stayed at the Laurel three times with our dogs. They are very accepting even of large dogs. The staff is warm and personable. The rooms are perfectly fine with small kitchenette facilities. The city view rooms cost a little more but are worth the extra money. There is no air-conditioning, so if you are there during one of those freak SF heat waves it can get toasty. It is located right by the Presidio - fantastic for dog walks - and offers discount passes to the gym at the Jewish Community Center right across the street - one of SF's best health clubs. It gives you a neighborhood feel rather than the usual tourist spots. Parking is no longer included, but for SF it is not that expensive."
13,2111,"Jul 15 2009 	Always a great stay	Have stayed at the Laurel Inn three times and have always had a great visit. Rooms are immaculate, beds are comfortable, staff is very friendly and helpful, great continental breakfast in the morning, warm chocolate chip cookies in the evening. The hotel in on a bus route in a safe neighborhood for walking with many restaurants in the neighborhood with varying price ranges and great shops to browse. Some rooms have kitchenettes. Parking is very convenient in their own garage. A nice, friendly bar is across from the hotel which is great for a glass of wine before dinner. We are always greeted warmly when we return. We recommend the Laurel Inn to all our friends traveling to the Bay area."
14,2111,Jul 15 2009 	Beautiful area beautiful hotel with GREAT staff.	The Laurel Inn is located in a very cute and comfortable neighborhood in San Francisco. The staff is excellent and the rooms are really big and beautiful. The hotel is also in a convenient spot for grabbing the bus line to the trolley and from there going to wherever you need to go. If you stay at the Laurel Inn you won't be disappointed!
15,2111,Jul 15 2009 	gracious and helpful service from all the hotel staff	Confer with front desk directly by telephone for booking.They are more helpful than using on-line.Housekeeping service friendly and accommodating.We have been quests multiple times and will return.
16,2111,"Jul 15 2009 	Great location and super staff	Stayed here over Memorial Day weekend during a business meeting at UCSF. Room was great, staff were very nice, and wireless worked well. The hotel does a great job with &quot;extras&quot; (eg, cookies in the afternoon, free glass of wine in the bar each day). The location is perfect with good access to public transport. It's a great neighborhood for walking, too. And the restaurant just across the street does an amazing brunch! I will definitely return to the Laurel inn."
17,2111,"Jul 15 2009 	Lovely rooms homey atmosphere	We have stayed at the Laurel Inn several times while visiting San Francisco. It is a lovely small boutique hotel.The rooms are comfortable and very well appointed. The people at reception are always friendly and make you feel welcome. If you are a returning guest, you can sign up for their club and you will receive a complimentary bottle of wine upon your arrival. There is a small charge for self parking but compared to other hotels in San Francisco, it is fair. They do a very nice complimentary continental breakfast in the morning and serve wine in the afternoon. The hotel is in Presidio Heights so it isn't right in the middle of town, but it is definitely a comfortable place to stay. The rooms that face the city are a little more expensive but they are quieter than the rooms facing the street. Some of the rooms even have small kitchens if you plan to stay for several days."
18,2111,"Jul 7 2009 	Great customer service all around	My boyfriend and I like to go out in the city and have dinner and drinks so we usually stay at a hotel and we've stayed at two other JDV hotels before so we decided to give this one a try since I've never really been through that area. We went to dinner up the street (just a short walk distance) and asked the front for a good lounge/bar. They recommended Swank Cocktail Club so we decided to give it a try and we liked the atmosphere. It was chill and were able to conversate and drink. I'm glad we didn't have to walk a lot much less drive. We just parked at the hotel (which I was suprised at how nice the parking manager was). He was very friendly, welcomed us and showed he cared about the customer. I could go on forever, but I was very pleased with the hotel's and parking staff's customer service."
19,2111,"May 12 2009 	Great location but needs more work.	We really thought the location was great. It was close to alot of things that we were interested in. BUT our room was just average. The bathroom and paint really needed some work. The bed was just ok. The noise level was pretty high in our room, as we faced the street. The front desk person was curteous."
20,2111,"Apr 1 2009 	GREAT Stay - GREAT Staff.	We had a 2 night stay in late March 2009. First I have to comment on Denise at the front desk. The MOST helpfull front desk person we have seen. The hotel although older was very clean and well maintained. Great location, with easy access to all the major spots in San Francisco. Would stay here again."
21,2111,"Mar 4 2009 	We LOVED this hotel can't wait to come back!	When we checked into our room, there was a special little gift waiting there for my 4 year old. The staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating to our family.We couldn't believe how amazing this room was. I will never stay anywhere else when I come to San Francisco. We can't wait to come back!"
22,2111,"Feb 18 2009 	Friendly staff and great location	Stayed for 3 nights at the LAUREL INN. It was a great location very near to the Presidio and well connected by MUNI bus routes. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, always with advise on getting around the city. The room was very comfortable, those beds are difficult to get out of in the morning! The TV with DVD was a nice touch and there is a choice of DVD's to borrow at reception. There is also a CD player, so you can play your own music too. The complementary breakfast is adequate, but if you want to be extravagant go to Ella's across the street for the full Breakfast experience. Parking is under the hotel and at $14 for 24 hrs not too expensive. There are some great restaurants close by, or within a 30 min walk; Greens @ Fort Mason is well worth the hike."
23,2111,"Jan 6 2009 	Loved the Laurel Inn	My husband and I both enjoyed our stay at the Laurel Inn. This was our second trip to SF this year and it was important for us to stay in a hotel that was updated, clean, and quiet. We really enjoyed our stay at the Laurel Inn. We were able to check in early and the hotel was quiet and our room was spacious. This hotel was near our friend's place which was why we stayed there, but we would stay there again regardless. The bus lines were really close by and very easy to use. We found several good places for brunch within walking distance to the Laurel Inn. Ella's is right down the road, as is Annie's Bistro. Both were excellent. The service of the staff at the Laurel Inn was superior as well. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. For the price, the service and amenities were well above average."
24,2111,"Dec 16 2008 	Very pet friendly - nice people and nice htoel	We took our two dogs and stayed while visiting friends. Very nice people, clean hotel and safe parking. All around great hotel."
25,2111,"Nov 13 2008 	Charming quaint hotel in central SF location	If you're looking to stay at a very charming, quaint hotel, then try Laurel Inn. The lobby and sitting area are comfortable, and the rooms are simply furnished and looked retro. There was nothing pretentious about the staff or the services. They were very helpful in directing us around the city to restaurants. It was a no-frills boutique hotel that felt like home, and that was the best part."
26,2111,"Jul 28 2008 	Very Nice Stay	I responded to a discount offered through Travelocity for this little hotel in Pacific Heights. Not sure what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were professional and friendly, offering assistance with the coffee service and directions for using public transport. A bus stop not even one block away made late night returns to the hotel feel safer.During my stay, I attended the LGBT International Film Festival and was happy to be greeted by staff who not only discussed the festival details without reserve but treated me, a genderqueer person, with respect. Furthermore, in honor of Queer Pride, I asked Tanya at the front desk to assist me in ordering flowers for the arrival of my partner. Tanya said she would take care of the details. Two days later, I was greeted by the delivery of a huge bouquet of beautiful flowers. My partner was delighted and so was I. In addition to the wonderful and personal attention to service, I found the bed, pillows, sheets and comforter especially nice. The bedroom was quite large (for San Francisco) and I enjoyed the big TV.The bathroom was large but not well planned out as the door opened into the space where the toilet was located. Anyone sitting got a whack on the knees when the door opened.The second night of my five night stay, I overheard other patrons saying they heard a lot of noise the night before. I am a light sleeper and was surprised to hear this since my room was very quiet. Perhaps being on the third floor made the difference.Overall, my stay was very nice and I definitely got my money's worth at The Laurel Inn. I hope to stay there again on my next trip."
27,2111,"Jul 25 2008 	Outstanding value	My husband and I booked a room with a kitchenette for a 3 day stay. I used recommendations from other Travel Advisor reviewers and we were definitely impressed. Great location, wonderful desk help, 24 hour coffee and tea, continental breakfast and a very clean and large room. The kitchenette had a stove, refrigerator, microwave, sink and all the cooking utensils we needed. Lots of places to walk, shop and eat, plus the bus line was just outside the hotel. Would recommend this place to anyone."
28,2111,"Jul 19 2008 	Too noisy!	I recently stayed at the Laurel Inn for a one night stop over. When making the reservation over the phone, the man making the reservation seemed &quot;put out&quot; just talking on the phone. When checking in, this gentleman seemed the same. Not friendly at all. No one to assist with luggage or the offer of, anyway. The room was very noisy! I believe I have never stayed somewhere more noisy. Even with the 2 fans they provide in the room due to the lack of air conditioning couldn't drown out the 24 hour traffic. Then when checking out they automatically put on your room charge a dollar donation to a charity. When checking in, the front desk mentions it to you, but they do not disclose that they will charge you without asking you before you check out. Not sure what this is about. And then who gets the credit for the donation, the Laurel Inn or the person making the dollar donation? I can only imagine it is not the person paying the dollar. Good things: bedding was comfortable, room was clean. Lots of green! Whoa."
29,2111,"Jul 16 2008	Great Place to Sta in the City	For my wife and I this was an exceptionally rewarding stay. Advice on buses, restaurants, shops etc, was given freely, our wedding anniversary was acknowledged with a lovely card signed by the staff, a HUGE cake, a bottle of wine, which we came home to after a long day of sightseeing. Our only complaint was that our city facing room made it very hot as it got the sun full blast for most of the day. On mentioning this in passing at the desk, we were quickly offered the choice of moving rooms to the cooler side of the hotel. Which we gratefully accepted. Couldn't recommend the Laurel Inn enough. Safe, and beautiful neighbourhood, easy access to major parks and downtown. Great dining all around the hotel. Quiet, modern, yet with the feel of a boutique hotel, the Laurel Inn suited us perfectly. Many thanks again to Kate and all the staff at the Laurel. See you folks again soon. Cheers Geoffrey &amp; Alison"
30,2111,"Jun 23 2008	NO AIR CONDITIONING!	For all of you East Coast people who are used to being HOT in June, do not stay at The Laurel Inn. They DO NOT have air conditioning in any of the rooms and their website does not disclose this information. In the room I stayed in, there was a little window that opened, but it had no screen. And even if it did, I wouldn't have left it open b/c 1) bugs/mice/men could easily have gotten in the window and 2) the enormous, heavy window drapes covered the window anyway, so no air was getting in the room. They provided 2 fans in the room but they did little. SF was unseasonably warm and it was sweltering in the room. Also, the front desk staff was extremely disorganized and weren't very polite when I called about the AC. Oh, and also the two fire escape doors on my floor were propped open all day and were only closed when I called about it. And when I did call, it seemed like I was bothering them. People from the outside easily could have gotten into the hotel without going through the lobby. I would have switched hotels, but I was stuck here b/c there was a convention in SF that week and all other hotels were booked."
31,2111,"May 21 2008 	San Francisco's best kept secret!	After hearing such rave reviews of the Laurel Inn from a fellow friend the Laurel Inn became the obvious choice when it came to visiting family in San Francisco. The hotel is a few miles from downtown, but the number one bus stops right in front of the hotel which makes an easy trip downtown or to the wharf. My room on the city side had a nice little kitchenette and a sweeping city view. The beds were really comfy and there was even a septate sitting area with a sofa in the room! The refrigerator came in handy after bringing home the leftovers from Osteria, a great Italian restaurant next store. There is always gourmet coffee in the lobby and a free continental breakfast every morning. This is a small hotel which is staffed 24 hours and all of the staff is very friendly and edger to help you with any of your travel needs. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
32,2111,"Apr 28 2008 	Great 2 night stay	I spent two nights at The Laurel Inn (12th and 13th April) arrived at the hotel direct from the airport - approx 30 minutes drive in a cab. The hotel is small, but the rooms are larger than average, we had a huge bedroom, kitchen area, with cooker, micowave, fridge and all kitchen utensils. Nice big bathroom. The room was extremely clean and well furnished. The hotel is in the more residential area of San Francisco our room had great views looking downtown. You can easily take a bus to all the tourist attractions, we did a great deal of walking and the area around the hotel is very clean and tidy. I would definately recommend anybody to stay here."
33,2111,"Apr 10 2008 	Great Deal at the Laurel Inn!	We stayed at the Laurel Inn for 3 nights while visiting friends who lived a few blocks away. The hotel is affordable - average of about $200/nt. with taxes - clean, and has a friendly staff. It's not the most convenient to the entire city - my husband took the bus to the financial district and it took about 40 minutes off peak - but if looking to stay on the outskirts and/or in Pacific Heights, it is a great deal. Continental breakfast and coffee were good; afternoon fresh (warm!) chocolate chip cookies were excellent. All in all would stay here again."
34,2111,"Apr 9 2008 	Pet Friendly Find in SF	We chose the Laurel Inn because it takes pets and provides parking, but found that it has a lot more going for it. The location in a quiet residential neighborhood was great for us, as it gives a different view of SF than the usual downtown one, but it could be inconvenient for some travellers. The rooms were unusually large for a city hotel, and very comfortable, with a pleasant and muted &quot;W-ish&quot; decor. Our first room had a small kitchenette, the second did not -- here, a micro wave and a small fridge would have been welcome. The front desk staff was very helpful and very welcoming, to us and to our standard poodle. The parking was great. And the price was very reasonable, considering the quality of the place. We would recommend the Laurel enthusiastically to our friends, unless they need to be downtown."
35,2111,"Jan 6 2008 	Decent value in an Expensive City	I visited San Francisco for three nights and booked the Laurel Inn because I wanted out of the Union Square/Fisherman's Wharf orbit. The area around the hotel is very pleasant, but you obviously don't come here for the nightlife. My room was ok. It is evident the management has tried to put a dress on a pig, but in some ways they have succeeded and some ways not. There is no A/C, but in the winter that is not really an issue. There was a wall heater that required some fiddling as there is no conventional thermostat. I had standard, albeit velour, drapes and blinds in my room....each on half of the window for a unique window treatment. The TV was a widescreen....about a 37-incher I'd guess and quite nice. The floor squeeked like crazy and there was an apparent water stain down one wall of the room. There is no free internet, and, although Wi-Fi is available, AT&amp;T will naturally soak you for signing up for 24 hrs. (Tip: go to the library 1 and 1/2 blocks away on Sacramento St.) The staff is helpful, and the complimentary continental breakfast is passable. All in all, I might consider staying here again."
36,2111,"Dec 3 2007	Little Hotel with Flare	This is a little gem on the corner of California and Presidio. Nice neighborhood. Safe, secure parking under the building. Very, very large rooms and huge bathrooms, beautifully refurbished and expertly cared for. Just nicely done. The best part of the Laurel Inn is its very pet friendly atmosphere. We often travel with our toy poodles and they are always welcome at the Laurel Inn. Charmingly professional front office staff. Small lobby with easy access to their own underground parking. Ella's Restaurant across the street is excellent...limited hours, but deliciously hearty breakfasts. Just a block away on Sacramento St. are shops, more restaurants and a movie theatre. The superb MUNI stops on either side of the Laurel Inn. Couldn't be more convenient for easy access to any other neighborhood or attraction in the city. The Laurel Inn is an absolute gem."
37,2111,"Nov 4 2007	Good experience	I chose this hotel because of its close proximity to the Pacific Surgical center and because of its reasonable parking rate. It was a good choice. The desk staff was helpful in all respects, recommending excellent but moderately priced restaurants. They also knew the area well and guided me to practical shopping areas for specific purchases. There was plenty of good hot coffee included in the continental breakfast. The room was perfect for a day of post surgery recovery, with plenty of space, plus a microwave and refrigerator. We will stay here again, even when not going to the surgical center."
38,2111,"Nov 3 2007 	180 degrees different from Union Square hotel experience	This charming hotel is quiet and pleasant, but it is quite removed from the tourist areas and hustle and bustle. If you intend to spend most of your time near the waterfront and Union Square, this may be too far removed unless you are willing to travel by cab or bus to those areas. Bus stop for a speedy and frequent No. 1 bus is directly across the street, will deliver you to Union Square/ Chinatown/ Ferry Terminal Bldg in about 15 - 20 minutes. This hotel is located in the middle of residential neighborhoods, offering a &quot;locals&quot; experience of San Francisco.Having said that, we liked it alot! The parking garage is extremely convenient if you arrive by car, the G bar next door is a fun happy hour spot. Our room was quiet large and comfortable. Bed, pillows, linens were very comfortable. The lobby is small and often crowded, the continental breakfast is average, with alot of people competing for food and drinks during the peak time period. One elevator, it is rather slow (in case you are one of those people who really despise slow elevators).The immediate neighborhood has a few restaurants. Be sure to ask about Laurel Village, a couple of blocks away, with many more neighborhood stores and restaurants. About 10 minutes into town on the No. 1 bus is New Fillmore (at Fillmore and California) with several terrific restaurants in a couple of block stretch. Try The Grove.We had a large and comfortable room with a great view for $180 per night, including continental breakfast. Parking an extra $15/day. This is a joi de vivre hotel, we made use of their San Francisco Greeter program -- EXCELLENT! Loved it, so glad that we did it. A wonderful volunteer, 20 year resident of the neighborhood, met us at hotel lobby and took us on a delightful walking tour of the area and then taught us the system with the bus and escorted us to a few tourist highlights. Can't say enough good things about how nice that was.If you are traveling with teens or with persons who are primarily interested in shopping and entertainment -- pay the extra money and stay downtown, you will be much happier.If you are traveling with persons who quickly grow weary of crowds, lines, noise, jostling, this is a pleasant oasis to use as a base for excursions INTO the more lively areas of the city.Service was good, facility is spotlessly clean, and well managed. Our impression is that the hotel primarily serves out-of-town-relatives visiting people in the neighborhood, persons with business at the nearby college or Jewish Community Center, and tourists looking for a more quiet San Francisco experience. It was pretty much sold out during our stay. The photographs on the website are accurate."
39,2111,"Oct 9 2007 	Relaxation after all those hills!	We stayed here after travelling around CA in Sept 07 and wanted somewhere nice to stay before our long flight the next day. The room was big (if a little warm), cozy and the bed was fab. We had the city view room which was nice. The room was big with a big TV. The bathroom, especially the shower was great too. Would definately recommend."
40,2111,"Aug 29 2007 	cute boutique hotel	My family and I just returned from a stay in the hotel and found it very charming. The room decor was modern and was clean. The room was bigger than a standard hotel room with a nice kitchenette nook and separate dressing area. At first we were concerned because they don't have air conditioning but with the cool SF nights it was not needed, however the room windows did not open wide enough to provide great air flow. The room was a bit stuffy when we entered and it took a while (by leaving the room door open) to let it air out. The mid-afternoon lemonade and cookies is a nice touch. There was ample free parking and most staff members were helpful, while one, a woman, seemed bothered or struggled with our questions for directions. The hotel is located in a cute residential neighborhood with shops and a few cafes within walking distance, though some a good ten to fifteen minute walk. A fuse did blow while the TV and the microwave was simultaneously on and someone came up right away to return power. overall we would stay again."
41,2111,"Jun 29 2007 	Best Find in SF	We travelled to SF for a wedding in June 2007 and decided to travel with our small dog. The Laurel Inn was recommended to us by friends who had seen it on Citysearch as being dog-friendly, which it was. There is no extra charge for yourpet.We have stayed at the W, St. Francis, Fairmont, Hotel Rex, and Orchard Hotel in previous stays and this hotel has become our favorite.There is underground self-parking which is in the hotel building and while it is not free ($15/night), it is very convenient and safe.The rooms are very large and we had great views of the skyline. Linens are comfortable and soft. The bathroom is serviceable without the latest amenities, but certainly fine.The location of the hotel is incredible. It sits at the foot of the Presidio and is close to many trails through the park. There are a number of great restaurants and shops in the nearby pacific heights neighborhood, including a great Cuban coffee house down the street.The staff is very friendly (the desk attendant gave treats to our dog) and helpful. The morning breakfast (rolls/bagels/fruit/hardboiled eggs) is palatable and filling. There are nice touches like afternoon cookies and round the clock coffee. In summary, one could pay double or triple the amount to stay in a hotel with superfine linens, marble baths, etc and then get hit with parking/gym extras, but this hotel is very reasonable. The location and the staff makes this hotel one of those special finds. I didnt even want to write this review because I didnt want the hotel to get more crowded, but my wife forced me too...."
42,2111,Jun 4 2007 	Great Place!	My friends and I stayed at the Laurel Inn on New Years Eve. The hotelhad free parking and was located near some great restaurants. The rooms were clean and comfortable and were decorated very nicely. The price is also very reasonable. I would definitely return to the Laurel Inn.
43,2111,"Apr 11 2007	Great Spot	I was in SF for a training and wanted to stay in more of neighborhoodas opposed to downtown or off Lombard and the reviews of this place got my intrest. I asked for a quiet room and paid slightly more than my state per diem and recieved a room on the third floor with a fantastic view of downtown SF. Room was plenty large,which allowed to do stretching exercises and the decor made me feel like I was staying in a pretty hip place. On the negative, the tv was pretty poor (on last legs it seemed) and the room was getting a bit &quot;worn&quot; from use. Loved the location as well. Since you are in the center of the city you have pretty easy access to all the bus lines and great local resaurants are close by. I'll be staying here again I'm sure and will look forward to it."
44,2111,"Sep 28 2006	Beautiful!	I stayed here 2 nights (Friday/Saturday) as part of a wedding block. The rooms are generously sized with very soft linens! Rooms were very clean. More lighting would have been nice as it was a bit dark, but it wasn't critical. Aveda Rosemary Mint bath products were a definite bonus! Very friendly staff. Very conveniently located with a great bar (G bar) next door. We had a front facing room on the 2nd floor and we were actually surprised how quiet it was."
45,2111,"Aug 17 2006	Nice room very noisy	I had to stay here for an interview. The free parking was nice. I needed to sleep. That did not happen. The jazz bar downstairs is extremely noisy. When I complained, they told me they had a right to play loud music. I only fell asleep after the bar shut. The room itself was nice."
46,2111,"Mar 2 2006	Loved it.	My wife and I spent one night at the Laurel Inn when we first arrived in San Francisco. We were there one night before heading to Napa Valley for a couple of days, and then returning to SF for a conference in the Union Square area. We wanted to stay in a different part of the city than Union Square, as we wouldn't have a car later in the week. The Laurel Inn was an excellent value, in a great location. Near the Presidio, and the western beaches, it allowed us a chance to explore that part of the city. The room was pretty, with classy, comtemporary decorations, very quiet, and very roomy. It had a little bit of a view of the downtown skyline, free parking, and free coffee and juice in the lobby. It is close to several quite good restaurants. It was also very fairly priced. We would definately stay there again."
47,2111,"Jan 16 2006	Great find	This hotel is a great deal for San Francisco. The price is right (with free parking), it's in a lovely neighborhood away from the crowds, and has terrific modern decor (quite refreshing from traditional hotel furniture). Even the continental breakfast is a step up. We would definetly stay here again."
48,2111,"Nov 8 2005	it was just ok	Cost: $155/nightPros: free covered parking; convenient location; reasonable neighborhood; clean; Cons: small room; furniture, paint, bed linens need replacement/facelift; pillows uncomfortable; complimentary breakfast selection minimal and below average quality We'd stayed at the White Swan Inn on previous visit (owned by same hotel company) and were hoping the Laurel Inn would be of similar quality. Relatively speaking, the Laurel Inn was a disappointment. It was an OK place to stay, nothing more. We had a &quot;city view&quot; which was pleasant."
49,2111,"Oct 9 2005	Nice enough mid-level hotel in Pacific Heights	If you're looking to stay in the Pacific Heights area, this is probably your best bet. Otherwise, there's no real reason to stay this far from the rest of the action - but if you do, it's a nice enough place.The hotel is bright and pretty charming, with lots of color in the comfortable rooms. Furnishings are also colorful and fun, and are decent enough. The atmosphere is held back a touch by the fact that this looks to be a relatively old motel-style building, so while the spit and polish work nicely, they don't quite cover it all.Free parking is a nice touch in SF. Staff was memorably friendly and helpful.In the end, if I had to stay in the area again, I'd probably stay here. Otherwise, I'd prefer other areas of the city."
50,2111,"Sep 14 2005	Good hotel - we would stay there again but not in the last room	Very good hotel with a great staff! Ella's is a yummy breakfast place across the street, and across the other street there is a JCC that you pay $10 to use - huge pool, really nice locker rooms, nice big exercise room. We went almost every morning. The neighborhood is fun to walk around, with lots of consignment shops and fancy houses.NOTE: We reserved the LAST room in the hotel (we were travelling with another couple and wanted to stay in the same hotel) - do NOT reserve this room! It was in the back by the garage and very dark (although decorated OK, it felt like being in a basement). The other couple's room was a fantastic big room on the second floor with a kitchenette. The front desk kindly moved us for our last night to a really nice king room on the third floor with a view."
51,2111,"Jun 18 2005	Details keep it from being 4*	We just stayed there 2 nights/2rooms and it is spacious and modern, good hotel but the details of service keep it from being a solidly above average stay. First, we had booked 2 kitchenette rooms a couple of months ago, but never received an email confirmation after phoning it in. I called back and they &quot;corrected&quot; my email address...but then still didn't get it. When we checked in, they gave us 2 rooms on two separate floors despite explicitly promising 2 3rd floor (top floor) rooms. This meant a less-good view but also running up and down the stairs. Next, the room we were in had 1/2 the view blocked by scaffolding used to paint the building, but we did not get any discount (non view rooms are less). Then, when we got to our room, it was - ahem - clear that the toilet had not been cleaned. Finally, when I called down to ask directions, they said they'd check and call back, but they never did. To be clear, these were all service problems, but the rooms were nice and very spacious for the price and for SF. There is no air conditioning, but the temperature was fine. The noise from the street through the open window, was mild to moderate as long as you have a room facing the city, not Presidio Avenue. All in all, we would probably go back, but take the service issues with good humor."
52,2111,"Jun 3 2005	Good deal but still a city hotel	We booked a room with 2 double beds and requested a city view. You can see the picture of the city view including a view of the roof of Hollywood video store. In the far distance you can see the city capitol building and the bay and part of the Transamerica building. If staying here, go for the city view side, the Presido side of the hotel is on a busy street - Presido! Overall, the hotel is a 1960's motel that has gotten a face lift. Decent rooms but the paint in the bathroom was a bit cracked and there was not tub though a sizeable shower. City noise wasn't too bad except for the low bass vibrations which we guessed were coming from the hotel bar below our room - earplugs did the trick! Free parking is a bonus in the city and overall it was a good place to stay. Didn't wow me but also didn't disappoint. As a member of the frequent stayer club I was greeted with cookies and 2 water bottles in our room. A nice touch!"
53,2111,"May 7 2005	A lot like home	My husband and I recently spent a week at the Laurel Inn and had a wonderful time. Prior to our visit, I mentioned to them (via email) that we were celebrating our 25th anniversary during our stay. When we checked in, they wished us a happy anniversary without my mentioning it, and when we got to our room their was a vase of fresh tulips and a card wishing us all the best on this occasion. That sort of set the stage for a great visit. The hotel is wonderfully decorated - with bright and interesting colors that make you wonder why every other hotel uses so much beige. The king sized bed was very comfortable - especially because it was piled high with throw pillows that were plush, colorful and comfortable. The little kitchenette helped us save money (for other things while shopping!). Another thing I noticed is that the housekeeping crew hardly made a sound and you never got the feeling that they were anxious to get you moving so they could get their work done (though I'm sure they would have preferred that we moved faster some mornings).In general, this is a homey, clean, creatively-decorated, quiet and smallish hotel (with free parking!) that I would stay in any time I come to SF. The staff was friendly without overdoing it, and was very professional and helpful when necessary.The only downsides were a shower with very low water pressure (and no tub), and no internet access in the room, unless you wanted to use dial-up. I would think that all SF hotels would be wired by now...given the technology-rich community that it is.All in all, a WONDERFUL place and I recommend it highly."
54,2111,"Apr 20 2005	Great Location	My wife and I spent three nights at the Laurel Inn. It's located in a greatneighborhood--Pacific Heights. Good restaurants nearby--Sydney's, Ella's, the Magic Flute, Garibaldi's.The Laurel Inn is cozy, with nice rooms, good-sized bathroom, comfortablebeds. An added bonus is the convenient FREE parking. The staff wasprofessional and helpful. The one drawback was the lack of a/c--fortunatefor us that it wasn't needed.The Laurel Inn was perfect for us."
55,2111,Mar 30 2005	Great spot!	We recently stayed at the Laurel Inn to be near my nephew's apartment. It was a wonderful hotel with great staff. The rooms on the Presido Street side are quite noisy most of the night and early in the morning...so get a room at the back of the hotel if possible. The location is so nice.....great areas to walk and shop and eat. Ella's Restaurant is GREAT for breakfast!!!! Don't be alarmed by the outside look of the hotel.....it is kind of tacky! The Free parking is a great deal in this city!!!!!
56,2111,Feb 7 2005	Good value great location	In a city infamous for high hotel prices the Laurel Inn is a find. The location near Pacific Heights is a big advantage and the rooms are clean and well decorated. There is a feeling of intimacy and coziness which is hard to find in a big city. The staff are helpful and accomodating. And parking in their garage is free. The rooms overlooking Presidio Avenue are a little noisy so I would ask for a room toward the rear and/or on an upper floor. The rooms on the other side are quiet but more expensive as they have a view. When I complained about the noise I was told that the room I had been given was for internet reservations and that to get the best room and rate I should call the hotel directly.
57,2111,"Aug 4 2004	A unique place to stay	One of the attractions of the Laurel Inn is that it is in a nice, more residential neighborhood, with shops and restaurants nearby. It is a bit removed from more touristy areas, such as Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square, but public transportation can get you there and back (however, while the buses ran quite frequently during the day, they are not as frequent at night and it took a while longer to get back to the hotel). Our room was 316 (two doubles with a kitchenette) with a view overlooking Presidio Avenue. The room was quite spacious and we were very impressed with the attention to detail. The furnishing, lighting and other decorative touches were done very creatively. The bathroom was small, with only a shower, but once again the amenities (Aveda products, fresh flowers, egyptian cotton towels) more than made up for it. We enjoyed the other amenities the hotel had to offer--onsite parking, continental breakfast, cookies and lemonade in the afternoon. We did find that staying next to a major city street was quite noisy during the day (those garbage collectors have early hours!), but did quiet down at night.If there was just one negative that prevents me from giving this hotel a 5-star rating, it is the inconsistency of the front desk staff. There were at least three wonderfully friendly people manning the front desk who went out of their way to be helpful. However, there were two sour people in particular who made you feel like you were imposing with every request. It is not enough of a negative to keep me from staying at this charming hotel again, but it would be nice if all the front desk personnel had the same customer service skills."
58,2111,"Jul 7 2004	A great hotel in a great location	On arriving at 3AM after a 6 hour drive we were delighted with our room (a king kitchenette) and the view from it. The decor was tasteful and soothing, the kitchen had a full size stove and all the equipment one could need, and the whole place was spotless. (We peeked into other, smaller rooms without a view-- which are less pricey -- and they seemed just as nice.)The Inn is in a terrific neighborhood, in walking distance from the Presidio (and the Marina, if you're hardy), with a great breakfast place right across the street. Small touches like the internet station on the 2d floor, cookies &amp; lemonade in the afternoon, and very good coffee are also appreciated.At $205 a night (including tax) the kitchenette/view rooms aren't the cheapest option in SF, but are a nice splurge. For about $50 less you can enjoy most of the same benefits without the view."
59,2111,"Jun 29 2004	We checked out first morning	I should start by saying the hotel itself may be great, but my rating was on our experience..we checked in at 10.00pm and there was no bell service available. i was tired and that kinda pissed me off...we booked a non smoking room but the floor and our room stank of cigarettes. the guy said there was nothing he could do. the next morning they told me he works for another hotel and just fills in for the night shift so he's not able to change rooms.first they tried to tell me it was a non smoking room on a smoking floor! after i stopped laughing, they said they could move us in three days time. we then went and booked into the huntington hotel.went back to the laruel inn and checked out citing we werent happy with the room or the service. when we went up to the room to get our luggage, reception called and offered us a non smoking room on a non smoking floor - which actually pissed me off even more LOL so it took us checking out before they found a solution...so as you can see, our experience was dreadful. and when im choosing a hotel i consider the experience just as important as location, rooms etc."
60,2111,Jun 29 2004	very honest and accomodating	We were driving up the coast in our camper but decided to stay in a hotel the night we were celebrating a friends 50th in SF. (Hard to get taxi service from campgrounds!) The hotel helped us find parking and the room was very nice. Pastries that were actually edible in the AM. Would stay there again! Good value
61,2111,"May 17 2004	A great pacific heights getaway	I did not know what to expect, coming to town for a meeting at usf. This hotel is so quaint, so san francisco, so comfortable. I loved the decor! The breakfast and afternoon teas and coffee were awesome. A small, quaint, lovely hotel, a lovely experience!"

1,2112,"Nov 14 2009 	a great deal for the money all you need great staff good location	My husband and I stayed here for one night recently and had a very pleasant experience. The bed was good, the bathroom was clean and newly remodeled and all the basics were there including an iron and ironing board and hairdryer. Very nice for the price. The best part was the staff who were very gracious and helpful and the lovely Otis elevator--we were told to treat it was love as it was impossible to get parts for it. It is also very conveniently located near Union Square and the Bart Station."
2,2112,"Sep 22 2009 	worth for price	Good location of the hotel. Close to shopping street and start of the railway tram. Not to fancy but evrything you need is their. Clean, quit!"
3,2112,"Jul 23 2009 	Bad area of SF could get more for your money elsewhere	We stayed in the Layne Hotel at the end of our round the world trip and although it was pretty cheap considering the cost of San Fran and everything was within walking distance, we were disappointed by the room and the service. The hotel is old and the rooms are tired with few facilities. We had a shared bathroom room and when we arrived were handed a toilet roll to take with us when we went to the loo. You could barely get into the bathroom as it was so cramped. We had been unaware on booking the Layne that we would be charged a damage deposit of $250 which was held in our account until we checked out. We were not told this and when we talked to the manager about it he was rude and shouted at us and made us feel very uncomfortable. We actually moved to a different hotel half way through our stay and would not return to the Layne. Anywhere were they say, &quot;dont turn right out of the front door&quot; isnt a winner with us!"
4,2112,"Jul 5 2009 	A disgusting hostel.	Actually is it not a hotel, it is a hostel. Rooms are very dirty.There is no hair-dryer, no air-conditioner in the room. Very old elevator. It is in bad area of the city. This hostel displays itself a good one but it isdisgusting. The bathroom and restroom are dirty also. The TV control is not working because its batteries are leaked. I think some comments about the hostel is just imaginary and lie."
5,2112,"Jun 15 2009 	hostel type hotel in bad area of the city	i went to this hotel on the advice of tripadvisor- it is in the tenderloin, close to union square but a very scary area - the room was tiny, no a/c, very loud, manager looked afraid to unlock the door to let us in, then locked the door behind us...lots of rules about how to use the elevator, no coffee, no amenities. Which would all have been ok if it had been inexpensive, but they charged me more than quoted online to have our two daughters in the room with us, it ended up being almost $200 per night. I could have stayed somewhere much nicer for less. The only good part - we were only 2-3 blocks from the theater, which is why we were there. It was just not a nice walk."
6,2112,"Jun 8 2009 	Great for what we paid!	We stayed at the Layne Hotel towards the end of our one year round the world trip. We booked the most basic room with a shared bathroom and stayed for 5 nights. It cist us around $50 per night through hostelbookers.com.The room was comfortable and had food preparation facilities (something very important to us on a budget :)), it was cleaned daily and the shared bathroom was never busy or dirty. Breakfast, whilst included, was pretty poor ($1 pre-packaged pastries and one cup of coffee/tea) but for what we paid we didn't feel this was a problem.The reception staff were always helpful and polite, the location is fantastic for seeing all sights. We walked most places as we had a lot of time and although some of these walks were pretty long, they were also a great way to see San Fran.After a year away we looked for and found a decent budget hotel, it is not luxurious and if I ever returned to San Fran or had friends visiting on a holiday, I would not recommend it unless they wanted a low price, good location room. To us, and after over 16 weeks in campervans in Oz/NZ and 5 days in flooded Nadi and a cockroach infested hostel, just having a TV and microwave in the room was fine :)"
7,2112,"May 22 2009 	Very friendly and helpful staff	The hotel is old but the prices are low, the rooms are clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. They didn`t even take tip although I wanted to give them some because of their kindness. Itslocated less than 5 minutes walk to union square. I recommend this location to everyone who needs a bed to sleep and a clean room during vacation. Who`s searching for luxus has to go anywhere. I would sty their again."
8,2112,"May 13 2009 	Excellent budget hotel with all the service you could wish for	The stay at Layton hotel was excellent, the staff was really great and gave us all the help and advice we could wish for. The room was very nice and cosy and it was situated right in the centre.. just 5 min walk fom union square... I really recommend this hotel!!"
9,2112,"May 13 2009 	Great place for budget travellers right in the center of SF	As a woman who travels solo most of the time, it is very important to me to stay in a place that is easy accessible by public transportation. This is definitively the case for this hotel since it is only few blocks away from Union Square, BART, cable car and bus stop. The rooms are very clean and the managers of the hotel are very nice and helpful. If you consider the high price level that you can find everywhere in San Francisco, this hotel is a great deal. I will definitively stay there again during my next stay in San Francisco."
10,2112,"Feb 8 2009 	simple and friendly treatment	Layne Hotel is well collocated, just some blocks from the lively and elegant Union Square. Its also near to Powell Street, famous and coloured for its historic cable cars. The hotel is led by an Indian couple. They both are very kind and friendly. They will be glad to give you useful informations, if you ask for something, to organize your citytour and to get the best from your staying in San Francisco.The rooms are newly renovated, very simple but extremely clean. You have television, fridge and microwave. I surely reccomend you Layne Hotel, especially for its collocation in Downtown and for the Kindness of the owners. The prices are also reasonable.Daniela."
11,2112,Dec 26 2008 	Never Stay Here!	Absolutely nothing would make us think about staying at this dump - we lost our money rather than stay in this fleapit. The rooms were filthy and the decor unbelievable but the management still insist on keeping your payment even though to stay would endanger your health! They describe the hotel as recently refurbished but couldn't even show us one room that had even been recently redecorated never mind refurbished.
12,2112,"Nov 23 2008 	nice place to stay well located (not at night tough..)	For being my first time in SF, I think I did a good choice with this hotel. The only thing is that before getting there, I called to see if I could arrive before the check in time and they said there will be no problem...yes there was a problem, because I have to wait 2 hours before getting to my room!! the guy at the front desk was kind of rude with me, so I just went to the restoran on the corner (were they serve hamburgers and chinese food), the food was pretty good and pretty cheap too. My room was ok, pillows are hard as a rock though, I had to sleep with a sweater instead. Bathroom clean, breakfast is really crappy, you have to go downstairs to get it, and they only have either coffee or juice, and one of those danish sweet things....there's no tables were you can sit to eat, so you have to eat it in your room. Fortunately, I had a grosserie store close so I bought some bread, ham and cheese for the rest of my stay.The hotel is really well located, is only 15-20 min away walkingto Union Square, were ChinaTown is too. Bus station is only around the corner, but I recomend if you're coming back at night, take a taxi or simply don't walk alone, specially if you 're a women (i'm not saying that WE don't know how to take care of ourselves...but this neighborhood is FULL OF HOMELESS PEOPLE!! always when you leave the hotel, make a left and keep walking...I stayed in the hotel for 5 days, during the Oustide Lands Festival. The hotel offers a lot of brochures about tours and places to see. I was happy to do a whole tour of SF for only 60-something dolars, this included Muir woods, Sausalito, Alamo Square, Chinatown, Golden gate bridge, etc. I recomend this hotel to young couples and lone travelers"
13,2112,"Nov 14 2008 	Great location and lovely clean room	This place is perfect if you want a clean bed, clean bathroom, a quiet nights sleep and a great location. It's a great cheap hotel. It might be cheap as a few homeless people are about, but that is a sad fact of city life and they are harmless. The whole city is a polite friendly place and great for tourists and the hotel is a great credit to it. It's in a great location, 5 mins walk from Union Square, near to the cable cars, BART and lots of buses too. Dotties Cafe opposite is ace too. Go here!"
14,2112,"Nov 8 2008 	Great Stay	Just came back from an excellent 10 day stay at Layne Hotel. Brillant location close to union square/powell st. Staff/front desk very friendly and helpful. Room large and very clean - it had TV, microwave &amp; fridge. Room cleaned daily and fresh towels provided. Didn't have breakfast - had american breakfasts out every morning. Would definitely stay here again. Real value for money."
15,2112,Oct 20 2008 	Clean and Quaint	I visited San Francisco with my daughter and because we were price shopping for hotels I knew that I would get what I paid for. The hotel was in a good area not far from Union Square and shopping at Market Street. The hotel itself has been renovated and was very clean. It still uses the 'old fashioned' elevators which are a nice break from all the electrical technical stuff we are surrounded by daily. The 'continental breakfast' was different than expected but good enough for a quick pastry before heading out into the city. The management was extremely nice and we felt very safe with the locked from door. I would definitely stay here again unless I am planning to spend gobs of money on a hotel room somewhere else. It gives a taste of the diversity of San Francisco!
16,2112,"Oct 9 2008 	Terrible Customer Service	The hotel owners required my guests to leave driver's licenses at the front desk to come up to room and watch baseball game. Needless to say they were quite insulted and put off. Additionally, they called the room and informed us that I could not have guests in my room past 9pm. The staff called continually throughout the evening to ensure that we didn't have guests (well past 11pm). These are their policies, which as a seasoned international traveler, I have never come across anything as insulting. It felt more like a halfway house (as far as treatment) than a hotel. I would not recommend the Layne Hotel to anyone, under any circumstances."
17,2112,"Oct 7 2008 	Fawlty Towers does not compare!	Terrible experience, arrived at 1:30, smelly and musty reception area, the man at the desk started to process our details and then said the room would be ready between 3 and 4 o clock, went for a walk and then arrived back at 3:45. Other people starting to arrive back for get key cards to rooms but they still were not ready. The reception man was slow, and went through a map of the area with everyone even when there was a q which further dealayed the check in process. Said he would check and see if our rooms were ready then and went off up the stairs with us waiting 5 minutes for him to come back. Our room was still not ready but he started on about payement then. Because we had booked on hotels.com and had no triple A card we were not eligible to any discount!! Due to a convention on in town that week we had to stay at the hotel for the 3 nights as there was no other place available. Finally got into our room at 6 o clock after a lesson in how to use the lift!! The Superior Room with a City View and continental breakfast turned out to be average sized room, with homeless people shouting outside the window at night and breakfast was tea and a banana passed out over the reception desk. The only positive was the bathroom was clean but the smell of cleaning products and bleach every day was very strong. Would not recommend this hotel."
18,2112,"Oct 5 2008 	Definetely too expensive!	Definetely too expencive! Just because there was no free room with bathroom we took room without one. Room was very old and not very clean. There was no aircondition and sink in room was dirty. Sheared bathroom? - no comment - betterstay dirty all week.The worst was fact that if you want to change something with your booking they will charge you a 'security deposit' even over 48 hours beforethe date. Even if your reservation service e.g. hostelbookers.com took it before. . Location is great from the point of distance to the most attractions but there are lot of homeless individuals walking, sleeping and asking for the money in front of hotel!"
19,2112,"Sep 29 2008 	Too expensive for what you get	We stayed at the hotel with a crew of 4 people. Overall the hotel is a nice place and has clean rooms. In addition, it is located in a good area close to Union square, right where we wanted to stay. However, for what you get in return the hotel is absolutely not worth the money we spent for those rooms. The service could be good if you could understand what the poor man was saying, and if he could somewhat understand what you are saying. I have stayed at quite a few hotels but never have I had the problems when checking in and out from this hotel. The check in took app. 30 minutes, which is a lot when the only only thing you want is to go to you rooms and rest. Also, the night before we were supposed to check out the man stopped us and wanted us to pay for our room because the person who were supposed to work in the morning didnt know how to charge a credit card. (This was at 1am). The breakfast, which you are suppose to get in the morning, is joke. When we reserved the rooms the guy told us that breakfast was included. What you get is a dry piece of biscuit covered in plastic (looks about 5 years old) and a coffe.To sum it all up. Nice-clean rooms, horrible serivce and staff that does not belong in a hotel. With the US$150/night + taxes you can get a way better hotel than this. Even though they say that breakfast is included you will still need to buy breakfast somewhere else, which is another cost. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, unless there are no other rooms available in the city...then maybe."
20,2112,"Sep 20 2008 	It felt like home	I just returned from my trip to San Francisco. My experience at Layne Hotel was excellent. Thumbs up! The personel is friendly, very helpful. If you arrive early for check-in or if you check-out and your flight is only in 6 hours, you can leave your luggages safely. They take good care of their customer. My room was clean, big enough, the bed was excellent, like my own at home. I had a private bathroom, clean, the towels were changed everyday.Yes, the hotel is located at the edge of Union Square and Tenderloin. You can see homeless people. However, they don't bother, they ask for spare change. If you walk on Geary street, there is a lot of people, you will feel safe. There is a police station three streets down toward Market street, I felt safe even at 11 pm. It is well situated, the Muni bus #38 passes on Geary St. toward Ocean Beach and also the Legion of honor, you are 5-10 minutes from Powell BART-Muni metro station and the Powell-Mason &amp; Powell-Hyde cable cars. For sure, I will return to Layne hotel if I am going back to San Francisco."
21,2112,"Sep 7 2008	friendly hotel	this is a friendly, clean and charming place to stay. It's rather simple, don't expect fancy extra's. The people working there are willing to help you and explain you where you need to go. It's on the edge of a not so good area, if you keep in mind where to go, it's no problem at all and close to union square where you can easily walk too."
22,2112,"Aug 17 2008 	Nice little hotel	I came to SF for business and had to select a reasonably priced hotel. I was pleasantly surprised by the Hotel Layne. It is family-run and they make you feel welcome. The rooms have basic amenities such as an ironing board and blow dryer but are not fancy. The bathroom was spotless. Neighborhood borders on the Tenderloin and the streets get a little tricky (panhandlers, etc) but it's not the worst I've seen. Just use street smarts and you'll be fine. Would I stay again? Yes!"
23,2112,"Aug 13 2008 	Brilliant Location Clean Rooms	The Layne hotel is in a brilliant location, 2 blocks from Union Sqare. I stayed there with 3 of my friends. As we are students, it was more expensive than a hostel,but it was worth it as the rooms were really clean, tv with good channels, nice bathroom. The hotel is ran by an Indian family who are all really friendly and gave us a good discount at a local Hookah bar which was a fun experience. Breakfast however is a bit misleading, you ask at the reception desk for a coffee and a packaged pastry, its ok on the go but there's not really a place to sit down and its uncomfortable asking for refils. There are quite a few homeless people on the block near the hotel but they dont really hastle you, you are in the tourist area of Union Square in 3 mins!! There is a Starbucks and a Wallgreens located right nearby!! Def worth staying here!!"
24,2112,"Aug 11 2008 	Love the Layne	This is a wonderful hotel, old school architecture all newly renovated and very clean. The room was modern and very comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, especially Raj. Perfect location for exploring San Francisco. I would highly recommend this hotel for an enjoyable stay in that magical city."
25,2112,"Jul 24 2008 	pleasant experience	hotel layne is a fantastic hotel. located in the heart of sanfransico at powell station, it was really convenient for going to the places of interests. the staff at the hotel were also extremely friendly and briefed us on how to walk to chinatown, union sq etc upon our arrival. the room was really neat and tidy. i saved alot of money walking to the places of interest not having to take the BART and i'd definitely go back to hotel layne if i go back to san fran =)"
26,2112,"Jul 24 2008 	A very pleasant stay	Me and my Mom went to the Layne in June 2008 and stayed there for 4 days. It is very central-located, just 10-15 min walk from Union Square and Market Street and just 5 min from the bus stop. As soon as we arrived the first thing our taxi driver told us, was not to go right down the hill, but only left. Well, in fact, we discovered that on the right side there were a lot of poor and homeless people and also drug addicts. But just dont go there alone late at night and you will have no problems. Our stuff in the room was always still there when we came back and it was also very quiet, at night too (remember we stayed there during the Gay-Pride Weekend!). As soon as we entered our room we recognized a little muffy smell, but after two days with opened window it was gone. Our room was cleaned every day and they gave us always new towels and soaps. There was a refrigerator, a microwave, an iron and a hair-dryer and also cable tv, although we were so tired every night, that we just fell asleep in our beds!. The beds are in fact very comfortable, however the bed cover smelled a bit. There was always hot water in the shower, but it came not so much water down from it. Anyway, the hotel staff was very very friendly, explained us the ways to get to the various parts of the city and always gave us two cups of coffee or two donuts for breakfast, if we asked for it. The elevator is one of the old ones, with the grate, but it worked and was very characteristic. So, in conclusion, our stay at the Layne was satisfactory, especially if you consider the price and the fact that it is very close the the centre of S.F. I would recommend it to young people that want a place value for money while they visit the city, but also to families, couples or older people that content themselves with not so much, but that appreciate friendly and kind people at the front desk. My mother and I were very satisfied with the Layne!"
27,2112,Jul 4 2008 	Best value in town	The Layne Hotel would have to be one of the best deals in San Francisco. Not only is it in a great location it has wonderful clean rooms with the most wonderful staff who are so helpful and give great tips of what to do and where to eat etc.Do yourselves a favour and stay here.After nine weeks in North America this would rate as the best hotel that we stayed in and the best value for money.
28,2112,"May 5 2008 	LOVELY HOTEL	I love this hotel sooo much! It first and foremost, the people who work there are the nicest people you will ever meet.They are so nice, and they take very good of you.The rooms are great, the beds are comfortable, the location is excellent!!!I really can't tell you how great this hotel is.There is also a great little Turkish restaurant across the street, and its great!!! I highly recommend this hotel,and I will definitely stay there again!!EXCELLENT HOTEL!!!"
29,2112,"Apr 30 2008 	Excellent value. A hotel with comfort 	I would highly recommend this hotel for couples or travellers on a budget. It's on the edge of a slightly dodgy area but so long as you approach from the up hill end you'll be fine. Beggars are a fact in San Francisco, they are to be found around all the nearby posh hotels too. We had no problems at all. The hotel is very secure with a 24 hour reception to buzz you in. The location is good. A few blocks from Union Sq &amp; all the shops. Plenty of attractions a quick walk or bus ride away.The room was spacious with a big comfy bed, fridge, microwave, big TV, modern bathroom, lots of hanging space, desk, nice decor and all in good, clean condition. The communal areas are a little dated but well kept and with a nice character (we enjoyed the vintage gated elevator!) The owners are very friendly and helpful. This place was a real bargain - the nicest and cheapest place we stayed during our American tour."
30,2112,"Apr 27 2008 	The best hotel in the world	The Layne Hotel is an excellent place to stay while visiting the beautiful city of San Francisco.We have been traveling the world for a year and stumbled across The Layne Hotel through &quot;Hostelbookers.com&quot;, which gave us an excellent rate and has been our best accommodation for the price throughout our travels. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted by friendly and helpful staff They gave us great information about the area from places to eat to things to see. The room we stayed in was spacious and to a high standard, with a microwave, fridge and cable tv. It was cleaned daily with fresh bed sheets. The shared bathrooms were new and fresh and always clean.This hotel is a perfect place to stay if you want a quiet, friendly and good value for money hotel in San Francisco. In fact it was so good that we have booked to stay here again.The location of the hotel is just 4 blocks from Union Square and minutes away from great local eateries. Although the area has many homeless, it is not dangerous and The Layne Hotel has 24 hour security ."
31,2112,"Mar 25 2008 	value for money	I stayed for 5 nights in the hotel , i must say it is value for money. it is very near to all amnesties, and city centre. the manger and his wife were very freindly. rooms anre clean and linen changed every day. i had superkiing size bed for single occupancy. overall impression is good apart from the neighbiurhood which is bit rough, but no trouble"
32,2112,"Mar 20 2008	One of the best hotels in San Francisco	Rooms were very clean, excellent service, absolutely magnificent"
33,2112,"Mar 12 2008	Horrible Layne Hotel	We were lured into the hotel via phone by incredibly low prices. Once were arrived, we were told a different fee, which was very high compared to the first fee.We were tricked into going to the Layne Hotel by false information and were told that were would have to pay a one night cancellation fee. We were lied to multiple times.The neighborhood is very unsafe!"
34,2112,"Mar 4 2008	Great Service and Beautiful Rooms!	The hotel was absolutely fabulous! The customer service was great and they made sure my needs were met. When I called the front desk to ask for anything the employees were very prompt in bringing the things I needed as fast as they could. The rooms were spacious and priced accurately. The decor was simply yet elegant, which is something that I recommend for anyone who wants a place to just relax during all those hectic business trips. The restaurant is also located right next to some fabulous restaurants so you don't have to travel too far to find good food. I don't know if any of you have been to Shalimar or Chutney but both of these restaurants will make your taste buds tingle, and they are both located within a block of this hotel.Overall, I completely enjoyed my stay at Hotel Layne, and I would definitely come back to stay each and every time I come out to San Francisco, and I highly suggest that you do the same!"
35,2112,Feb 29 2008	At-home atmosphere	Randy Patel - the owner - and his family treated me and my husband like their own family. Comfortable experience. One of the best rates in town! You won't be able to find a better rate in the heart of downtown San Francisco with this kind of family-comfortable atmosphere.
36,2112,"Jan 4 2008 	Comfortable clean safe room	We stayed for 4 nights at the end of a 10 month round the world trip. The hotel is run and staffed by a friendly Indian family who are happy to assist with enquiries without being 'in your face'. Security is good with camera entry on front door and key card to room. We had a large room with two double beds, tv, loads of storage and a good en suite. The room was cleaned daily and was spotless. We were at the front of the Hotel but didnt find it noisy. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable clean room travelling on a budget."
37,2112,"Nov 13 2007 	Good experience	From 24th of nov. till 10th of nov. I stayed in Layne Hotel. The hotel is nice, quiet. The building and the room are kept well and very clean. The people who run the hotel are very nice, polite, helpfull and kind. The place is safe. I trusted the hotel completely, had never difficultys to leave things of valuable worth in my room behind. The people that worked there were all very nice people!There is no breakfast, but if you want you can get till 10am coffee.It is downtown, well located nearby public travic. It was always very easy to find my way in the city.Prices of the rooms are very attractive and most reasonable.The frontdoor is always locked, for safetyreasons. There is 24 hours somebody available to open the door for you if you want to come home anytime of the day of the night.If I come to San Francisco again, I definitely would like to stay in Layne Hotel again!Ren Veen, Utrecht, Netherlands."
38,2112,"Sep 7 2007 	Randy is the best!	Randy is the best. Ask for him, he'll definitely take care of you.This boutique hotel in the middle of downtown is walking distance from anything and everything in SF.The rooms are great and the service is even better.If you are looking for a place to give you everything you need while in SF, make this your place."
39,2112,"Aug 14 2007 	too strict	This hotel stay was so awful. There where bums at the front door. The floors where really dirty. I got yelled at alot by the manager. In all of my past hotel stays that has never happened to me. I wanted to leave but I had a no refund policy. It was my sisters birthday. I wish I could get my money back from our very expensive and awful experiance. This is by far the worst hotel experiance I have had in my entire life. In order to enter the hotel you have to get the door opened for you and you have to have wait for someone to walk down and check your id. You may not have anyone visit you at all! I did do research before we went to the hotel and the pictures where beautiful. It was not like the pictures. There is NO PARKING! Do not trust the parking lot next door. I witnessed a couple of cars getting hit and the owner of the car asked the attendent what happened and he acted like he didn't know. I have so many more compliants, but I'm afraid they won't all fit."
40,2112,"Aug 6 2007	Scary neighborhood	I can't comment on the hotel, but the neighborhood did not look safe. We booked the hotel via Hotwire since it was advertised as Union Square &quot;West&quot;. What Hotwire doesn't tell you is that west of Union Square is The Tenderloin which is the most crime ridden neighborhood in San Francisco. We never entered the hotel because we did not want to stay in that neighborhood. Still fighting with Hotwire to get my money back but I'd rather lose the money than risk the safety of my girlfriend and property. If I didn't have my girlfriend or a car with me, I might have stayed there. For downtown San Francisco, it is a bargain. But you get what you pay for."
41,2112,Jul 24 2007 	Good Value at the Layne	We just stayed for one night at this small hotel just a few blocks from the action at Union Square. The hosts are very friendly and most anxious to help. Our room was small but the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had been recently renovated. This property is great for anyone looking for value for money. We would stay again but next time ask for a room on the back because Jones Street is quite noisy.
42,2112,"May 22 2007 	Good experience	We stayed at Hotel Layne from May 18-21, 2007 and overall had a very positive experience. The hotel is located a few blocks from Union Square so it's a great base for exploring downtown. As long you make sure to walk down Geary street there shouldn't be a problem (i.e. you won't get hassled by street people). We made our reservation through Hotwire and thought that the price was very reasonable ($74/night) given the central location. Make sure that you ask for a room facing away from Jones Street when you check-in, otherwise you will be up all night due to the noise from traffic. The rooms were very clean and had all the necessities (including a fridge and microwave). However, breakfast was not included contrary to Hotwire's assertion that it would be.."
43,2112,"May 20 2007 	Not worth the price at all!	We booked this hotel trough Hotwire so we did not have the choice after and we weren't able to be reiumbursed. It was a terrible stay! The curtains have HUGE holes in them, the window is so thin that you can hear everything outside. It is VERY noisy during all the night (firemen station near so you have the sirens all the night, a noisy bar right in front og the hotel). The room was kind of clean (the bathroom was OK) but everything is very very old and not in good condition. There is also a lot of homeless in the Jones St. so it's not safe during the night.Clearly the hotel is not worth 2 stars and not worth its price (around $130 tax inc.). For 30$ more you can have a MUCH better hotel near chinatown and union square. I took some photos of the hotel quickly, and you'll understand why there no more (and bigger) photos on the hotel's website."
44,2112,"May 3 2007 	Not the best place...	My partner and i decided to stay at the Layne Hotel as we heard the location was very good. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted at the reception by a woman who was training a new member of staff. So the check inn wasn't the quickest we'd recieved on our trip across the US. We were then given the key to our room, when we got into the room it had a strong smell of disinfectant. Which was not nice because none of the windows opened. The rooms are very basic and smell clean but don't really look it. My partner went to use the toilet and it didn't flush so i went downstairs to tell them and the lady on reception said she would get it fixed. By this point me and my partner went out for a while to chill out. Came back and were told we would have to change rooms because no one could fix the toilet. We were given a new key to different room, opened the door and there was tissue all over the table and no linen on the beds. At this point, i'm unhappy with the hotel because it wasn't as nice as i had heard about. I went back down the stairs and was given a different key to another room, apologies were made about the toilet and the other room being dirty. Finally the room, was cleanish but still smelt of disinfectant, oh well we decided it would do. We finally settled down and decided it would do for the days we were there and wanted to order a pizza. We tried to use the telephone in the room and it didn't work. Yet again i had to go back down the stairs and tell them the telephone didn't work. I wouldn't reccomend this hotel for a long period of time, two days max but only for the location. Thanks"
45,2112,"Apr 23 2007 	We liked it.	It all depends on what you want from a hotel. We need two beds, a fridge and a microwave. The Layne provides that. It ain't an upscale and fancy place, but it's clean, and Randy Patel, his wife and mother are wonderful hosts, and the place has charm with it's old elevator. If you like to walk around SF, this is simply the best location from which to start. It's walking distance from almost anywhere you want to go, and public transportation is easy, too. The neighborhood is the edge of the Tenderloin, and there is a wide variety of street folks, but the area is well police patrolled, and we never saw any unpleasant instances. We had a front street room, so there is a bit of noise, but you'll find city noise wherever you stay in SF and regarless of the price. We use ear plugs and slept easily in good beds. Believe me, I shopped around at all the hotels in the area, and found the Layne to be the best value for our needs. We'd gladly stay there again."
46,2112,"Apr 17 2007	Terrible experience	I do not know why it gets two star! I think it is worse than motel or inn. The room there is not clean and the smell in the lobby is terrible. There is no coffeepot, no cups, no shampoo, no toothpaste, no toothbrush, no air conditioner. Don't mention breakfast or internet or...In all, they apply nothing except the tissue in the bathroom. Besides, the elevator is so old that you have to worry about your safety while taking it and the stairs is dark and narrow. It is only enough for one person walking through. Trust me, do not take this hotel if you want a good mood and stay health in San Francisco. My friend lived in Fusion Hotel, I visited him while I was there. The fusion Hotel is also 2 star, but it 100 times better than this one. The location is convenience, the room is clean and the service is good too. I am very regret that I did not do any research while I took this one. I forgot to take some pictures about this hotel, or I can give you more information about this &quot;2 star&quot; hotel. It is really terrible experience there!"
47,2112,Feb 9 2007	Does what it says on the tin!!!	The Layne Hotel is a great base for a city break in san Fransisco. It has a great location just outside the main shopping centre of Union Square.  The rooms are fine/clean and you have everything you need.. Randy and his family who own the layne are very helpful and will help you out whenever they can...  if i were going to stay in san fransisco for a shopping or sight seeing hols then this is where i would stay again.. great budget hotel with great location...
48,2112,"Feb 8 2007 	Very perfect stay!	The Layne is a great place to stay in San Francisco! The location is excellent -- walking distance to Union Square, the cable cars, BART, and lots of interesting art galleries and restaurants. The room was comfortable, clean, and secure. The staff was friendly and gave me a great rate on the room. We even got a bigger bed than what I was expecting! They kindly watched over our luggage for the day after we checked out: we had a later flight out and happily tipped the kid at the desk for lightening our load for our last day of touristing. I trust he gave that tip to his parents! I'd definitely book here again and recommend the Layne to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean, safe place to stay while exploring around San Francisco."
49,2112,"Jan 19 2007 	Great place to stay	I stayed at the Layne Hotel between the dates of January 12 to the 17th 2007. I read many reviews of the hotel before I arrived so didn't know what to expect. I had read that the area was shady and that it was quite noisy so was considering changing to a different hotel. Well I'm glad I didn't. The owners were very welcoming, area was quite nice and I had no trouble sleeping at all (I am a very light sleeper). I even had to catch a tour bus from another hotel and had to leave at 6.15am and had no problem walking around at that time at all. I travel a lot on my own and had such a great time. The rooms were large and were cleaned to a very high standard. It is such a good price for the location. If you read any bad reports about this hotel then the people must be very very fussy!"
50,2112,"Nov 1 2006 	Mixed feelings but generally good.	The place has a very nice location as it is less than 2 blocks from Union square, and right in front of Dottie's cafe! The staff are very friendly, willing to help out and in giving directions. The hotel per se is clean, neatly painted. Their elevator is an old elevator which can be a pain for inpatient people. The room was clean every single day we stayed there. The bathrooms were also clean and the shower was spacious.The biggest problem we found was that we were staying ina 3rd story room facing the streets, there was a lot of noise and since the rooms have no AC noise to neutralize the street sounds, sleeping was diffciult at times. Also because the amount of drug addicts/beggars is increasing in this area sometimes you get pestered for money sometimes. Also there was a lot of noise and since the rooms have no AC noise to neutralize the street sounds, sleeping was diffciult at times. The room with king bed is not reccommended for more than 2 people as there is very little space left in the room. Also there is no free wireless."
51,2112,"Oct 30 2006 	Layne Hotel - A place to sleep without feeling ashamed. And not much more.	The Layne Hotel was adequate as a place to stay the night, but hardly enticing. I stayed four nights and was not at all sorry to leave.The antique elevator was fun and interesting, but not a real reason to stay overnight--visit it as a tourist if you like. If you have large dimensions or large luggage you might have trouble fitting through the elevator door. And, if you are uncomfortable with elevators, you definitely don't want to use this one as it operates with clinks and clanks and its workings are more exposed, being quite old. Small children definitely need physical restraining during the ride as serious injury is possible if you stick your hand through the bars. I wouldn't stay in the hotel with a small child just on principle.The narrow spiral staircase was not a great alternative to the elevator.And what is it with hotels and bedsheets? I like the sheet to cover the mattress and firmly tuck in, not to have an inch of mattress exposed at the bottom of the bed where my toes will touch it. Now, all mattresses at all hotels are not cleaned very often, but who wants to touch the same spot that other, perhaps unwashed feet have spent hundreds of nights touching? Yuck! Attempting repair of the sheet tucking revealed that the sheet was not long enough to tuck in both at the top and the bottom, so you have to choose one or the other. Also, the top sheet was tucked in so tightly and so far on the sides that pulling it out halfway dislodged the bottom sheet, too.The bed also had a bonus spring sticking out of it which I was able to avoid as I was its only occupant. But the two deep body impressions made the night a somewhat bumpy and leaning &quot;travelling&quot; experience.There is no air conditioning. Opening the unscreened window did cool the room, but once I was assaulted by cigar smoke and had to close the window right away.Directly across from the hotel is a massage parlor and within one block are three more. I know for sure that at least one of these has a rather liberal definition of masseuse (that is, prostitute).The front door is always locked and you have to be buzzed in every time you wish to enter. The staff was friendly and helpful.There was only a single garbage can in the room (in the bathroom), no facial tissues so blow your nose on toilet paper, and no clock on the nightstand, although they do offer wake-up calls.Pluses which I didn't really care about were a refrigerator and microwave.For the price, the room was adequate, and I am not telling you not to stay there, as nothing was so bad that I couldn't deal with it. But when you stay at a 2-star hotel, you get 2-star accomodations."
52,2112,"Oct 10 2006 	Not terrible....but now wary of hotwire!	If you booked your stay through hotwire and are now locked in, don't panic, it's not terrible. We just returned from 3 nights there after being locked in through hotwire. The rooms are ok, heed the other warnings - rooms facing the window are incredibly loud. It's not the hotel's fault, street cleaning is done daily in the morning and street drunks are loud late into the night.The hotel is conveniently located to Union Sq. and the fact of the matter is it's probably just one block over too far, making the location borderline. The family that runs it is very nice and helpful and they take every precaution to ensure that only hotel guests are coming and going - if someone at the front desk doesn't recognize you they'll ask to see your room key before you head into the elevator. We appreciated that.If you're traveling on a budget, the price probably can't be beat. However if you do have a little flexibility I might recommend looking into the Andrews Hotel which is only about 2 blocks away, but in the right direction."
53,2112,"Oct 6 2006 	Touch of family	I enjoyed my stay at the layne hotel in San Francisco. The hotel is near to many attractions in town and is worth its rate. My room was clean, particularly the bath room was cleaner than in hotels of a similar category. The service in Layne has to be emphasized: Owner Randy and his family are very helpful and they are really concerned about security of their guests (24h desk). I felt very homelike at Layne and can recommend it. However, the rooms to the street are noisy due to the bad windows but S. F. made me so tired that I had no problems to sleep. And Randy promised to change the windows in the next months."
54,2112,Oct 5 2006 	Good value helpful staff	We had a very nice stay in this family-owned hotel with character. The rooms are clean and comfortable and a great value for San Francisco. The owner/manager and his wife were very helpful and friendly. Our room was quite quiet. The only negative is that Hotwire indicated that complimentary breakfast was included but none was provided.
55,2112,"Oct 5 2006 	GREAT stay at Layne Hote	Enjoyed a 4 nite stay. Couldn't have been better! The owners, the Patels were a tremendous help with everything from restaurant recommendations to how to get around the city (directions, maps, &amp; transit) and what sights to see. Kathy was extremely knowledgeable about it all which was fantastic! The hotel's location is GREAT! Very short walk to Union Square, cable cars, street cars, buses to get you all over town. The room was very clean &amp; comfortable, good size, nice beds and bathroom. Liked having the microwave and fridge in the room.Very nice, clean and affordable. Would definitely recommend."
56,2112,"Sep 14 2006 	Great location friendly and clean	My boyfriend and I stayed here for 9 nights at the end of August. The family who run it are friendly and always willing to point you in the right direction to restaurants, sights etc..The hotel is only a five minute walk to Union square which suited us perfectly .I would highly recommend the Layne, it's very clean, the rooms had everything we needed, towels, iron, soap, shampoo etc. It is very reasonable, i would say you get more than you pay in every way. All I would mention is that if you can, ask for an internal room as they are much quieter than those overlooking the street."
57,2112,"Aug 14 2006 	Absoloutely fantastic budget option.	The owners were so helpful and friendly, they guided me to the best places to eat and visit and where to avoid.The room was old in style but so clean and comfortable and i would recommend this place to anyone. My room was a single one and beat being in a dorm!!! thanks to the owners for a fab time. Carolyn"
58,2112,"Aug 10 2006 	Thanks to Randy	We selected this hotel by chance. when we (three German Harley-drivers) reached S.F. on our rented bikes. Thanks to Randy and his wife for the hospitality and the good advices to enjoy the stay. The rooms were absolutely clean and quiet at nigthtime, we would come back."
59,2112,"Aug 2 2006 	really friendly	The owner Randy and his family are friendly and helpful.They told you not to go to certain areas because those places are not safe enough for visitors.They gave you some warm feelings and make your stay in this hotel assembled being at home.The room is clean and basically you got everything there.And so many channels of TV programs,not like some hotels only got handful to watch.The old-fashioned elevator,I like that to add some retro-style to this hotel.Glad Randy keeps that elevator.There's only one thing not so pleasant,the noise on the street.But that's the way it is to live in a big city.Overall I think it is a nice experience to stay here."
60,2112,"Jul 24 2006 	Great place to stay	This hotel is reasonably priced and well worth the money. The rooms are average, but they are very clean. Parking is nearby and you can feel safe leaving your car there. It is also very close to the trolleys and Market Square. The best part about the hotel are the owners. They are very helpful. They recommended places to eat and visit. They even made us a reservation with a table overlooking the water. Very nice couple and great customer service. I would highly recommend staying here."
61,2112,"Jul 17 2006 	Great Friendly Hotel for the Money	Very pleased with the excellent cleanliness of the room. The hotel evidently was renovated a few years back, and except for the lobby (which could use a makeover) it was spic and span. The check-in staff were extremely hospitable. The hotel directly straddles the shoddy Tenderloin area as well as the more attractive Nob Hill/Grace Cathedral area. Not to worry; the Tenderloin area is more filthy than dangerous as long as you keep your wits about you. Great Thai, Indo-Pak and Indonesian ethnic restaurants, as well as coffeeshops nearby. Short stroll from Union Square.Only recommendation would be to ask for a room if available away from the street, as it gets noisy there in the evening no doubt. Otherwise, a great stay at a most reasonable rate in a beautiful city. I would gladly recommend the hotel."
62,2112,Jul 2 2006	Super Kind Hospitality	Very nice hotel near the center of San Francisco.The owner is very kind and willing to help his hosts.Absolutely reccomended.
63,2112,"Jun 27 2006	Know where you're going and you'll be fine	Since this hotel's rates will attract budget-minded travelers, be aware that the hotel's &quot;incidentals&quot; deposit is $250. On checkout, you should be handed a void slip, which will completely annoy your bank as it eliminates all of their excuses for a poky return of those funds.Rooms were clean, though the blankets had cigarette burn holes in them and the carpet had some bad spots in dire need of a deep clean or total replacement. In-room television, fridge, and microwave were new and worked fine. Bathroom was clean, though the towels were small and thin.The elevator is old, but safe. You may find it is easier to walk down to the lobby than wait for the elevator. Late-night partyers should be aware that they turn off the elevator after midnight, which can make for a challenging trek back to your room in some circumstances.The neighborhood can be scary if you're not used to large cities. Not much can be done about it -- either you've got street smarts and common sense or you don't. Just be aware of your surroundings and you'll be fine.This is not a huge chain hotel. It is a 40-room inn run by a very nice family, who also happens to live on the premises. As such, they are somewhat observant regarding the people coming and going from their home. If you plan on having lots of guests coming on going, or any sort of noisy parties, you're probably best off sticking with one of the national brands.This is a hotel in the hear of a densely populated city. This means there will probably be noise around the clock. If you are expecting the monastic quiet of the suburbs, then you should probably find something down the peninsula instead of staying in the city."
64,2112,"Jun 13 2006 	Noise is the biggest problem	I decided to stay at the Layne after reading the reviews on internet thinking the noise can't be such big problem, and I was wrong. When I first talked in, I can see the hotel being a boutique, the service is good and the room is decent size for the price. The room is clean and they've got TV, fridge, microwave, and good condition bathroom. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy so you see homeless and weird people, but its expected in a city. However, the window of the room is too thin and cannot be shut seal, so I could hear people talking, cars driving by, and sirens going on at night. I would not recommend to anyone who is a light sleeper to stay here, and for heavy sleepers you should still try to stay away from the rooms next to the street. I have to say overall the hotel, the service, and the tidiness of the room is satisfied, but the noise is the only thing that keeps me from staying here again."
65,2112,"May 4 2006	A Great Budget Hotel	The Hotel Layne is an excellent budget hotel - one that I would highly recommend. It is very close to the heart of San Francisco, yet costs very little. It is run by a very hospitable family, the Patels, who do everything possible to make their guests welcome. The rooms are clean and comfortable - far superior to many hotels in higher price brackets.Stay there. See for yourself!"
66,2112,"May 1 2006	So-so.	My boyfriend and I stayed here last weekend after booking the Layne unseen through Hotwire. It turned out alright, but neither as great nor as terrible as some of the other reviewers' experiences.The good:The decor of the place was cute (but an old-fashioned cute that almost bordered on creepy, I must say). The man downstairs at the counter didn't seem too friendly when we first arrived, but he quickly warmed up and became quite nice. We ended up checking out a little late, at about 11:20 or so, but he didn't say anything about it or charge us extra.The room was a decent size, and clean, with a microwave and fridge, and the beds were nice and springy. It was within walking distance of Union Square, which was really nice. (But I wouldn't say it's in Union Square itself, as Hotwire did.)And we did enjoy using the old-fashioned elevator, although if it wasn't already at the floor we were, it takes so long to come that it's not really worth waiting for.The bad: The neighborhood was definitely sketchy. We had a room facing the street, so there was a lot of noise late a night and pretty early in the morning. The stairs are pretty narrow and curved - don't try to go down them wearing heels.The towels were very thin &amp; small - we wondered if maybe they had forgotten to give us bath towels at all; the ones we had were only slightly larger than hand towels.But I must say the thing that bothered me the most about this place was the way the beds were made. The bottom sheet was pulled way up so that about 6 inches of the mattress liner/mattress itself were exposed at the foot of the bed. We basically had to remake the bed ourselves. Also, the thin beige-colored blanket that's standard in these places had a bunch of holes in it (although they didn't look moth-bitten, thankfully).All in all, it's a passable place to stay if you're on a very tight budget. Not great, not terrible, just so-so."
67,2112,"Apr 27 2006 	Nice place to stay!	I stayed a week at the Layne Hotel and was very pleased. The room was very clean and comfortable and the bathroom completely renovated. Randy and his family were just great and the hotel is in a good location (the homeless people around the area did not bother at all). My only complain would be about the towels (too small and thin), but I will definitely stay there next time!"
68,2112,"Apr 25 2006	Pleasant Surprise!	Thank you, Randy and family for the wonderful hospitality that I received while I stayed at the Layne Hotel in San Fracisco during my participation at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, April 7-11, 2006. The room was clean, the service excellent, and the price just right. I have already spread the word among friends and colleagues about this wornderful hotel in San Francisco.Again, mil gracias!Carlos J. Ovando, Ph.D.ProfessorArizona State University"
69,2112,Apr 17 2006	A Nice Place to Stay	We booked our trip on Hotwire and were worried when we read some of the older reviwes posted to this site. We tried to get out of our reservation with no luck. Upon our arrival in San Francisco we were very pleasantly surprised. The hotel was close to all the shopping around Union Square. Our room was decent with a newly remodeled bathroom. Overall the hotel was very clean and comfortable and the staff were amazing. We had no more problem with homeless people near the hotel than anywhere else in the city and we would definitely stay again.
70,2112,"Apr 16 2006 	Great for the price -- terrific service	We booked the Layne through Hotwire, and were a bit leery after reading some of the reviews on this site. When we got there, however, we were very pleased. The hotel is extremely clean, the staff was GREAT, and the hotel is close to everything. It is a family run hotel, and they got the extra distance to make sure that you have a pleasant stay. Cathy was wonderful about actually drawing out where to go (and where not to go) on the complimentary maps at the front desk. Margaret followed up one of the wake-up calls one morning to make sure we were actually up, because she knew that we had an important early session at our conference that morning. I would recommend The Layne Hotel to any budget-conscious traveller! But do be aware that &quot;breakfast&quot; is just a packaged sweet roll and coffee... don't be disappointed."
71,2112,"Apr 14 2006 	Layne Rules!	The hotel is magnificent, and the service is incredible. It is conveniently located three blocks away from Union Square. The front desk people is extremely helpful."
72,2112,"Apr 11 2006 	Layne Hotel is our new home in SF!!!!	My husband and I were exhibitors at a convention in SF. We stayed at the Layne because it was a great deal in the Union Square (big tourist) area. We found the service to be impeccable and very homely and friendly. The family that runs the hotel is so very nice and we promised to be back again next year! The retro elevator was delightful and the hotel was busy the entire stay (5 days). The only complaint was the towels, which although were changed out every day along with room cleaning, were very thin. The hotel is an excellent choice for a budget traveler not looking for a hostel environment but wanting to be in the center of all the SF action. We'll definitely be staying at the Layne for years to come when we exhibit at the APE convention!!!!"
73,2112,"Apr 10 2006	Layne Hotel Amazing Hospitality	Layne Hotel is a great Euro style hotel in Union Square. When I called to make my reservation, I informed the manager of the business of my trip (surprise for a friend on birthday). To my surprise when I checked in, my room was upgraded along with the other friends I had staying there. They treated us like family from the moment we wented, till the moment we left. It is a wonderful family owned hotel. I highly recommend this hotel. As someone who has worked in 5 diamond luxury hotels before, you will not recieve the hospitality there, that you will recieve at Layne Hotel.2 Thumbs up, WAY UP.Ask for Cathy or Randy.Good Luck Guys!!!!!!!!"
74,2112,"Apr 6 2006	Checkout Layne Hotel on Jones street S.F	Whilst in San Francisco I stayed at Layne Hotel on Jones. I recommend to everybody as the Hotel is located close to Union Sqare,one of the famous landmarks of San Francisco. A walking distance to the main shops and an easy excess for buses, muni, cable cars. The staff at Layne are friendly, nice and helpful. The rooms are well equipped with a fridge and a cable t.v. It is clean,immaculate, quite and safe. No curfews and the rates are reasonably cheap. I would recommend Hotel Layne to everyone travelling by themselves or more when travelling to San Francisco. The next time I am around San Francisco, that is the place I would go and stay. It is the best deal in hotels in San Francisco. My stay was pleasant and enjoyable apart from the grey, wet weather which reminded me of home. I would like to thank the Layne staff for their hospitality. Cheers....Nina"

1,2115,"Nov 14 2009 	Great Location But Hotel is Very Basic	Our room faced onto a major road in the Marina District and was quite noisey. The furniture was quite basic and somewhat worn. If you got there early enough you get free underneath parking. I think we paid about $130 because it was located in a desireable area. Not too bad of a choice all-in-all, but i'd try to find a better place next time."
2,2115,"Jun 15 2009 	Great price and location.	Free parking! Only a couple of blocks walk from Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. There are several cheap breakfast places right around the hotel, as well as a little grocery. The hotel was quiet and priced well."
3,2115,"May 12 2009 	would stay again	The room was large and very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is no breakfast but within walking distance of some restaurants, A very nice service is free underground parking. We got to the hotel, parked the car and rode the trolley and bus to all the sites we wanted to see. The rooms at the back of the hotel (not facing the street) are very quiet."
4,2115,"Apr 6 2009 	Good location but bad service!	This hotel has got only one advantage: its prime location. The hotel is easy to find and it is situated in a very convenient spot on Lombard Street. Yet, the hotel has no other good quality. The rooms at the front side facing the street have a balcony but you are not allowed to smoke in any of them. I was dissapointed to hear that I had to pay and sign a $75 contract that would ensure I did not smoke in the room or harm anything. Paying the $75 fee and also $93 for the single room for a one night stay seemed useless to me. The receptionist who spoke with an unclear english accent, insisted that they would accept no other payment than credit card. The rooms were relatively small and the windows were kept open all day to ensure that the room was free of odor. The room was indeed odorless but was very cold to sleep in! There was a heater, but eventhough it was kept on all night, it did not warm the entire room. I believe I would have been warmer and comfier if I had slept in my own car! The hotel was not quiet as it seemed and because it is situated on a busy street you would have to hear the traffic and car noises in your sleep. The parking lot underneath the hotel is very small and narrow. I hardly parked my car without difficulty. It looked like a garage but it had no garage door! They suggested not to leave any valuable items in the car because it was open all night and they had no security guards to watch the cars. There is no difference between parking your car there or on the street. The hotel offers no breakfast and there is no near restaurant to buy your breakfast early in the morning. I was not content with the hotel staff either, they were not friendly nor welcoming. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to a friend."
5,2115,"Dec 11 2008 	Good Location and good no frills hotel	Visit 9th &amp; 10th November 2008 and again 14th &amp; 15th.This is a good clean hotel that is convenient to the Water and the City.Across the street you can get an excellent breakfast. It is on route 101 so is easy to find and there is free car parking.If you like walking you can walk to the beach and harbor in 10 minutes, about 20 minutes to the Italian area (avoid direct confrontation with the hills) and you can hop on a bus (drivers very helpful) to anywhere in the city."
6,2115,"Dec 2 2008 	Loved it - Great Location!	This hotel is a great little gem of a place. Very safe area, walk within one block to the bus stop which takes you a few more blocks to the Fisherman's Wharf area. Rooms were very clean, and done so daily. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful, with information, and maps. I would recommend staying here for sure as the price is great, area safe and the hotel is better than some of the more expensive ones in the area!"
7,2115,"Oct 9 2008	What a Find! Stay Here!	What a GREAT Find!CHEAPER Than Everything We Looked at...AND INCLUDES PARKING! (none of the other hotels we looked at did, most of them charge 30.00 a day for parking)VERY VERY CLEAN!NICE SPACIOUS ROOM!WONDERFUL STAFF!I recommend people to this hotel anytime someone I know is going to San Fran!"
8,2115,"Oct 7 2008 	Great Place	With reviews we read here and other places, we picked this place. It was everything you said it was. It's true. It didn't take long to get anywhere. I love the styles of the buildings so it was eye-candy the whole way. True too, you can get to the roof. It's not locked. (Shhh, I don't want them to lock it.). The VERY comfortable pillows and Serta mattress really came in handy after all of the walking we did. I only saw a few guests ever. The sign showed NO vacancy and it was really quiet. Parking in the basement, easy open access to the street. The price is very affordable for San Francisco. We would definately stay there again. I have included photos. One is from our private balcony. One from the room. Oh, and the balcony for the pic of the sign. Yes, it was right off our balcony!"
9,2115,Sep 23 2008 	Good Location...Nice Hotel!	This hotel has parking provided and is walking distance to most attractions including the Crooked Street. It is about a 15 minute walk to Fisherman's Warf but it isn't too bad. Good neighborhood and overall we would do it again.
10,2115,Sep 20 2008 	Good location nice room	Conveniently located motel within walking distance of Wharf and cable car. Clean room and recently refurbished bathroom. Having read reviews we booked room at the back. There was not much of a view but there was little street noise. Very good value.
11,2115,"Aug 20 2008	First time in San Fran	This was going to be my first time in San Fran and my wife's second. Our friend recommended getting a hotel/motel off of Lombard as there were good, &quot;cheap&quot; motels in that part of the city and it's a nice part of the city. I almost went with a hotel near Union Square- glad I didn't as other than the extravagant shopping, there wasn't much else there. LMI had a good clean rooms, surprisingly comfortable beds, and excellent service. They even let us keep our luggage there after checking out so that we could have one last romp around the city without having to drag our luggage everywhere. It may have been a small action on their part but it meant a world of convenience to us. It's a great location- just a couple of blocks from buslines that will take you to any part of the city, a nice walk to the Crookedest Street area and not too far of a walk to Fillmore/Union where there were decent shops and restaurants. The staff were helpful in showing where to go and how to get there, definitely utilize the Muni as it was the easiest/cheapest way to get where you wanted to go. Of course the only complaint was the street noise, but you're in a big city so it's expected. With some good earplugs you're set. Also, after a couple of nights, we didn't really notice the noise as all of the hustle and bustle during the day put us in a deep sleep at night. Between the price, location, service and room quality, it made us feel as though we got a great deal for being in San Fran."
12,2115,"Jul 18 2008 	Good Budget Hotel	I did my research and stayed two nights with my two kids. The location is good, had no problems parking my mini van in the garage, room was clean, staff was nice. On the downside we did have a room that faced the street. Wow was it noisy and we were there during the week - I'm sure it's even worse on the weekend. Didn't keep me awake, but it takes getting used to. If they want 5 stars they'll need to invest in double-pane glass doors."
13,2115,"Jul 5 2008	Great Place for the Price/Location	Two other friends and I spent two nights there. Having heard that the streetside rooms were noisy, we booked rooms on the other side. Our rooms were all very nice, very quiet, very clean, with comfortable beds. The bathrooms looked as if they had been recently updated, marble tile floors and tub surround. Nice little coffee makers with Wulfgang Puck coffee and glass coffee mugs. Nice touch! William, the night manager, was extremely helpful. Would definitely stay here again."
14,2115,"Jun 4 2008 	I Love this place!	The Lombard Motor Inn is such a nice place! The staff is friendly, the rooms are very nice and very clean, the parking is easy and free, which is a plus for the area, and the location is great, with walking distances to the wharf, to the crooked part of Lombard St, and even to the Union Square if you don't mind walking - and it is highly recommendable since SanFran is a city to enjoy by the details. What else can I say? I've stayed there twice, in 2008 and 2007 and will definetely go back. Great SanFran experience for a perfectly reasonable price."
15,2115,"May 16 2008 	Good place to stay near the wharf area	Good place to stay. Paid about US$236 for 1 weekday and 1 weekend night. I guess that's probably about the price in San Francisco, near the wharf area. This inn is within walking distance to the wharf area. We also walked to Union Square, Chinatown. Buses were nearby the inn. Free covered parking. Free wifi. The hotel was secured. You had to use a key to go into the reception and lift area. The room was spacious and clean. Towels were clean and no roaches running around. Came with air con and heater."
16,2115,"Jan 10 2008 	Great Value 	Stayed at the Lombard Motor Inn Jan 5 then again Jan 8. Great Location - we were able to walk easily back and forth to Fishermans W. Rooms 'with a view' do have a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge but are quite noisy with the Lombard St traffic. The rooms on the backside are much quieter. Parking was included and most hotels in San Fran charge extra for this. Room was clean with a comfy pillow top mattress bed, coffee maker,hair dryer, iron. I would definately stay here again."
17,2115,"Jul 27 2007 	Great location great value no terrible surprises	We booked our room well in advance by calling the property directly. We chose this inn for its free parking and proximity to the Golden Gate Bridge because we had a wedding to attend in Marin County but still wanted to stay in SF for most of our trip. We were not disappointed. The front desk clerk was exceedingly well-mannered and helpful when we checked in. We requested and received a room in the back because I had read on TripAdvisor that it could be noisy on the Lombard Street side. Our room was clean and a good size. There was ample storage space in the closet and dresser. The sink/mirror were outside of the bathroom. The shower was the only thing I really didn't like -- the water pressure was weak and the shower head was about a foot shorter than me! I literally had to do a back-bend to get the shampoo out of my hair. It's a good thing I do yoga. The housekeepers were really nice and kept the room fresh every day during our 5-night stay. We were able to park our car every time we came into the garages. It's a little hard to maneuver in the garages, though, and almost impossible to safely emerge onto the side street from the lower-level garage. (People in SF are not polite drivers, so be careful.) We found the location to be great for taking the city buses and walking to local restaurants and shops. If we returned to SF in the near future, we would definitely consider staying here again."
18,2115,Jul 25 2007 	Good value	Stayed here on an overnight in SF recently (7/15-7/16) . $96 for a double for 2 people including the on site self parking is hard to beat. Pretty convenient if you want to drive or leave the car and bus around town. Older venue motel but it was CLEAN and front desk staff was pretty nice. No real complaints. Would go back again without even having to think about it twice.
19,2115,"Jul 22 2007 	great value	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Lombard Inn. It is a great value for the price. Parking is free, the location is great. You can walk to Fisherman's Wharf and the Embarcadero easily. The crooked Lombard street is three blocks away.The Inn is by no means glamorous, but it is clean, quiet(the walls are so thick, we never heard any of our neighbors talk, watch tv, flush the toilet,,etc. Lombard is a noisy thoroughfare, but we enjoyed seeing and hearing the city life. We came to SF to be out and explore, not stay at the hotel. If you are looking for a convienent, clean, quiet place, this is it. If you are looking for spa service, room service go somewhere else."
20,2115,"Jul 5 2007 	One word-disgusting.	Thought this was going to be a great value for SF, but i was wrong. It would have been worth it to pay a little extra for anything else! The hotel facade was old and needed major updates, but that didn't both me too much. The rooms were terribly small, the TV was broken, the green carpet had stains on it, the blanket had mysterious stains on it, and the bathroom was atrocious. Hair on the floor, nasty sink, I didn't want to step foot in it, but had to. The staff was rude, their &quot;complimentary breakfast&quot; consisted of powered tang and powered milk. The heater didn't work, and I fought with the front desk clerk to get another (clean) blanket, and the manager finally stepped in and personally gave one to me. I can't beleive how horrible this place was!!"
21,2115,Jun 1 2007 	Great location for price	This was a very good location for the price. It was within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf if you don't have any problem walking about 3/4 of a mile. We took a bus to the GG Bridge which picked us up only a couple blocks away ($1.50 each way). There was free parkingin the garage under the hotel but there were only ten or so spaces. Luckily we arrived early enough to secure one. There was other free parking the hotel provided but I'm not sure where it was. There is not breakfast with this hotel. The room was very clean which is a major consideration with us. The hotel was quiet but there was some construction on the block behind us which started about 8:30 in the morning.
22,2115,"May 28 2007 	Fine Motel for the Price	We stayed at the Lombord Motor Inn from May 17-22nd. This was an average hotel. It was a cheap/affordable hotel that was in a good location. It is 2 blocks down from the &quot;crookedest street in the world.&quot; It is four or five blocks from Fisherman's Wharf. We found it much cheaper to walk everywhere as opposed to taking a taxi or bus. We did use the bus system to go to a Giants game and the bus stop is only one block from the hotel. By the way, the hotel does offer shuttle service to and from the airport. Use it! It was $14.00 per person there and back. We did not know that going to the hotel, so we got a taxi. It cost us almost $40.00! If you are looking for a fancy hotel with all of the thrills this is not the hotel for you. If you are just looking for a clean place to stay not far from the Wharf this is a good place. There is not a resturant at the hotel, but there is some cafes across the street, and tons of places to eat on the Wharf. Also we were told to request a room in the back of the hotel because Lombard Street can be noisy. We did not request it, but it was given to us when we checked in, and we didn't hear a thing at night. The shower was just okay..nothing too impressive. For the money and the location it was a fine place to stay."
23,2115,"Oct 1 2006 	Great place to stay for the budget conscious with a car	No frills but still very nice. The staff were extremely helpful. I returned to the motel late one night, and they even helped me park my car in the garage when all the spaces were taken. We requested a room on the third floor facing Lombard. We had a balcony that overlooked Lombard and had a great view of the Golden Gate. Very easy access to N and S 101, Fisherman's Wharf, and the MUNI bus that traverses down Van Ness. Price is nice as well. Since our room faced Lombard, which is an extremely busy street, we didn't hear our neighbors at all. Great place if you're just looking for a place to sleep. Comfortable beds, large room, free wifi and free parking! Can't beat that in San Fran. Will definitely return."
24,2115,Sep 22 2006 	Good value	A no frills place.Very clean and it felt safe.On the last block towards Van ness which makes it very close to Fishermens Wharf and all touristy stuff.Good parking thats FREE!We requested a room towards the back and got one. More quiet then our B&amp;B in Sonoma.Nice staff!
25,2115,"Sep 17 2006 	Lombard lacks luster	Picked this hotel on the basis of other reviews here. I knew going in this was a no frills or thrills kind of place, but none the less when you request a certain room type 3 months in advance you would think it might be honored. Yes the room was clean. I wouldn't neccesarily describe it as spacious. The maids were pleasant. Had to request extra pillows and towels but they were promptly obtained. Sorry to say but thier soap smelled very nasty and cheap. Underground parking was adequate. Had a room on the back side which worked out since it was quiet. Rooms did seem to have decent sound proofing. Never heard anyone elses water or voices in the rooms next to us. Only limited sound from the floor above. This place was in a good residential location in the Marina district and close to the Golden gate bridge. Easy walking to Chrissy Field, Chesnut, Union, Polk Streets. Walkable also to Wharf but we used Public transportation. Able to catch Hyde/Powell cable car several blocks away. Very steep climb up but not that tough. Bus transport from Chestnut St. or Van Ness. Would more than likely not stay again because not special enough to be memorable but loved the neighborhood. Lots of other picks of the same caliber on the same street."
26,2115,Sep 9 2006 	Very Nice no frills hotel	This was a very nice place. The rooms were large and nicely furnished. There was plenty of closet and drawer space. Our room faced the side street and was quiet. The only caveat is there are no window guards so houldn't leave the window open if you have young children with you. There is a/c though.All in all this was an excellent no frills hotel at a very good price.
27,2115,"Jul 20 2006 	Will Return	STAFF: One was very helpful and courteous. The other was a little crusty, but otherwise OK.ROOM: Very large (15' x 20' ?), very clean! Appears recently refurbished.INTERNET: wireless.LOCATION: Within walking distance to the Wharf. Good restaurants within easy walking distance on the same street.PARKING: Below the building and absolutely free. (Note: the Holiday Inn on the same block charges its own patrons $25 per night to park.)"
28,2115,"Jul 5 2006	It was OK	My boyfriend and I traveled to San Francisco for a mini-get away. Our reservations were OK, no problems with any of my requests. Check in was very fast. The parking was free but there are not many spaces. We couldn't find parking twice but the front desk gave us the okay to park in a restricted area. I wasn't aware that there is a charge if you request a refrigerator. It would be nice if they had microwaves. The irons are not in the room you have to go to the front desk to pick one up if you need it that day. The iron was old and the board was for table tops and didn't help very much. After a lot of researching online, I picked Lombard Motor Inn because it was in my budget. The online total was $341 but at check out I ended up paying $375. Not a big difference but for that price I could of gone somewhere were they offered a microwave and free continental breakfast. You are on a busy street so don't expect the room to be quiet. We heard a lot of street busses and cars but we did not hear our neighbors. That probably means that the walls and thick enough! This hotel was problem free but it just didn't suit me or my lifestyle. I would pick something a little more modern next time.PS - I don't know if this was allowed but this hotel has access to the roof were we enjoyed the views of the city! :-)"
29,2115,"May 30 2006 	Price Location Parking Cleanliness	This is by far the best combination of affordability and cleanliness in the Marina/Fisherman's Wharf area. Rooms are spacious and clean. The staff is welcoming and knowledgeable. The best part is free in and out parking, which is very hard to find in SF. Most hotels charge about $20 a day or more for parking. This place is well recommended and within walking distance of a lot of the typical attractions. Its also convenient to public transportation to downtown."
30,2115,"Apr 12 2006	Good Hotel	For the price, this was a decent hotel. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Hotel has parking. Staff pretty easygoing. No common space to hang out in beyond your room, but it didn't matter much for our group."
31,2115,"Dec 13 2005	Good Hotel	I've stayed at this hotel every year for many years. They have good sized rooms, comfortable beds,hair dryer,lanai(hawaiian for balcony), coffee machine, Tv with about 80 channels. I've always found it very accomodating. It's a few blocks away from Fort Mason a nice place to take a run or bring children to play at. I've never had any problems with this hotel and the price has always been reasonable.Right now I believe rates are 79$ till Jan 31, 2006.For more information check out:[--------------------]"
32,2115,Oct 13 2005	Great place	We stayed here for 3 nights. the rooms were a good size and very clean. The front desk staff were great allowing us to check in at 11am which was needed after a 14 hour flight from Australia. It was a $40 taxi fare from San Francisco Airport. It is a 15 minute walk with no real big hills to walk up to Fishermans Wharf. It is very easy to catch buses from just around the corner to other parts of the city.The air conditioner was noisey but we did not need it. We didnt find any good eating places around the inn. Overall a good place to stay.
33,2115,Sep 24 2005	Good hotel-always satisfactory	Convenient location and clean rooms. I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the years going back to the 80's and have always had a pleasant stay. Good value and parking on site.
34,2115,"Aug 21 2005	nice helpful staff	our family of three stayed 3 nights in aug, 2005.we booked on line not sure of what we where in for.we ended up being very pleased with the lombard motor inn.very clean room, the most comfortable beds i have ever had in any hotel! the staff was really nice and where very helpful with a few questions we had concerning which direction we were headed when leaving the hotel. free parking which is very nice to have in s.f. we always use the public transportation. so we had our vehicle parked the whole time. we love san francisco, but we don't love driving in it! it's nice to take the bus once you are there. so many sights along the way."
35,2115,"Aug 9 2005	The only place we stay in San Francisco	The Lombard is a tremendous value, with a good location, nice rooms and comfortable beds, free parking and a great location. We have stayed at the Lombard on three of our last four trips to San Francisco and were sorry the time we tried a different place. The location is close to two bus lines that make it easy to travel to most tourist destinations. We always buy transit passes and leave the car in the hotel garage the whole trip. The Marina District where the Lombard is located is a real residential neighborhood with good shopping, restaurants and bars and is not as touristy as staying at the Wharf or at a downtown hotel."
36,2115,"Aug 6 2005	Great stay for the price	Actually my husband, 4 month old &amp; ten year old stayed here for two nights. I booked through Hotels &amp; paid something around $60 a night or so. It was clean, within walking distance to the wharf, the cable car line, mini market/deli, diner for breakfast &amp; there was free parking (which is huge in SF) The only thing that would have made it perfect would have been a refrigerator, we bought a little cooler at the deli/market next door for snacks &amp; stuff. We had a balcony too, which was nice- Also, this is right on Lombard St (which is a pretty busy street) I wear earplugs at night so it didn't bother me, but if you are a light sleeper -ask for a room on the other side. There is one person at the front desk, he was helpful enough -we've been to SF many times though &amp; didn't have any questions. :) great deal.. would definately stay again."
37,2115,Apr 11 2004	loved the Lombard	Exceptional value for the money! Very close to fisherman's warf.

41,2115,Apr 20 2008 	Hotel perfetto!
1,2116,"Oct 23 2009 	Great Hotel in SF	We have stayed in a number of Mandarin Oriental properties around the world. The SF property definitely maintains the highest quality standards of the others we have stayed in. The service was oustanding. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. The view from our room on the 45th floor was spectacular and the room itself elegant. The in bathroom amenities were great. I have no negative comments about this hotel. I would definitely stay here again."
2,2116,"Oct 10 2009 	One of THE places to stay in a fantastic city	This was our first trip to San Francisco and part of a 3 centre trip to the West Coast. The MO provided us with one of the most memorable introductions to the city, we arrived by BART from the airport and emerged into the downtown area during a busy Friday lunchtime and it appeared like most cities.On arriving at hotel and being taken up to our room on the 41st floor we got our first amazing view of a the city from the glass walkway near the lifts. This continued in our room a Bridge to Bridge room giving us a 180 degree view of the bay and the city. We never closed our curtains whilst there so we didn't miss a minute of the view. We were also greeted by champagne and strawberries arranged by a friend as this was our 'honeymoon' after our civil partnership and also chocolates from the manager, all in the room on arrival shortly followed by the tea and almond biscuits. The hotel provided us with an excellent base to explore the city, even if the area around the hotel was very quiet over the weekend, but thanks to advise by the hotel we discovered the farmers market at the ferry building on the Saturday one of many highlights of our trip. As MO fans we were not disappointed and our stay strengthened our preference for the MO brand."
3,2116,"Oct 9 2009 	A quiet piece of SF	As a Bay Area local looking for a romantic getaway, the Mandarin Oriental was the perfect choice. It is centrally located, within walking distance of some favorite restaurants and sites. It is tucked away and quiet. The service is superb. The suite was beautifully decorated and generously sized. And the views were stunning. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel for anyone looking for luxury and serenity amidst the hubbub of San Francisco!"
4,2116,"Oct 8 2009 	Amazing Views and Service From Small Room	The views from this hotel were amazing. We stopped many times just to look and enjoy them. The afternopon tea brought to the room was a welcome touch. However, the room was quite small for two people, but the bathroom was nice. If it had been mroe than one night, it would have felt cramped. I'd also recommend this more as a business hotel, because on a weekend, this area was dead, and many cafes and coffee shops in the area are only open midweek. Don't miss the farmer's market at the Ferry Building a few blocks away."
5,2116,"Oct 4 2009 	THE BEST in San Francisco	Absolute perfection, even without a typically imposing lobby and bar area. The rooms, staff and view are as close to perfect as is possible. The 48th floor view, the sky bridge and the concierge's assistance made this the best hotel of our trip. A+."
6,2116,"Sep 26 2009 	Superb - as always	I would stay in a Mandarin Oriental in any city - as always top class staff that were very welcoming - check-in a little slow as i had arrived early but they found me a room within 10 minutes - not much of a view, but very nice room - great size, bright and airy - big bed, lots of room for luggage, desk for laptop, big bathroom - shower a little disappointing though, more of a mist than stream of water! - Concierge was very good - helped me with tickets to a game in San Diego - got us a table in Harris' steakhouse at last minute - even got the hotel car to drop us off - a nice touch, but nothing less than you would expect from this hotel group"
7,2116,"Sep 17 2009 	Faultless for a special treat!	We stayed for one night in a bay-to-bay room. We did not want to leave! We could not fault the hotel in any respect. The courtesy of the staff and the cleaniness of the room were all of the highest standard. The only slight downside was the 20 minute walk to downtown. Room service and extras are expensive, but you don't have to take them, and you are probably here for a special treat, after all!"
8,2116,"Sep 17 2009 	Uplifting views for tired room	The best part about this hotel is the view from the room. We stayed in the king bayview room, which had a view of the bay bridge and also alcatraz. The view was superb, especially when retiring on the day bed after a long day. The rooms itself, are showing a bit of wear and tear and are not particularly noteworthy. They have the same decor as other MO hotels, with touches of Asian flair; however, the furniture reminds you that this hotel has been around for at least a decade. The bathroom, while sizeable, includes sparse amenities, and the bizarre mini-tiled shower stall was reminscent of a gym shower and not a nice one. The service was good and consistent with other MO hotels; however, the early AM check out staff took a ridiculously long time to rectify our bill after a few hiccups. Like many others have mentioned, the location is very convenient, a short walking distance to Union Square or the Ferry Building.We booked a California residents rate off the hotel website, which was inclusive of parking. I would not have been happy paying the exorbitant overnight parking fee otherwise. The next time I go to SF, I will likely try a newer, more modern hotel despite the location, good service and nice views."
9,2116,"Sep 4 2009	Elegant Asian aesthetic fantastic views	Flew up to San Francisco for a quick 2 night stay with 2 simple objectives: 1) to see the Georgia O'Keeffe/Ansel Adams and Richard Avedon exhibits at the SFMOMA, and 2) to sample the many culinary offerings at the Ferry Building. Both the museum and Ferry Building are near Market St., as are several BART subway stops (we would be car-less, taking BART from the airport, SFO, into the city). In the past, we have had memorable stays at the St. Regis, Ritz Carlton, Palace, and Campton Place. All except the Ritz are close to Market St., all except Campton Place have indoor pools. Online, I discovered an enticing California resident weekend rate for the Mandarin Oriental. We have stayed at Mandarins in Hong Kong and New York and think it is a luxurious collection of properties with an elegant Asian aesthetic, so we decided to book here. Of course, we had heard about the Mandarin's vaunted views.The Mandarin is located in the Financial District, 2 blocks north of Market St. This is a very quiet area on weekends--even McDonald's and Starbucks are closed--but more active areas like Union Square and the aforementioned Ferry Building and Market/SOMA are within easy walking distances. The hotel occupies the top 11 floors (38-48) of the 3rd tallest building in San Francisco, so yes, the views are fantastic. The lobby, restaurant, lounge, meeting rooms, well-equipped business center and small fitness center are on the floors 1-4. There is no pool or spa, but guests have access to these at a fitness club across the street. The floors housing the guest rooms are dumbbell-shaped with about 7 rooms at each octagonal end separated by a &quot;skybridge&quot; corridor with windows overlooking the bay and city. The 38th floor has 2 suites with large terraces replacing the skybridge.Our reservation was for a city view king, but I noticed online the price point of a bay view queen, with the same square footage, was often identical, so we requested and were given this room type. I thought it well worth it to sacrifice a larger bed for a better view. The bay view extended from the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, the Transamerica building, Coit Tower, almost to the Bay Bridge. An insulated wicker basket with jasmine tea and almond cookies is delivered shortly after you arrive in your room. The room was beautiful, far from a simple box shape with few 90 degree angles. The sheer shades on the window are elegantly embroidered. The MO channel on the flat screen TV is fun to watch, quite imaginative. There were 2 clocks--one a standard gold alarm clock, the other a fancier clock/CD player whose alarm I couldn't figure out. There is a DVD player and large closet. We had to request slippers.The bathroom was fairly large with 2 types of marble, although the counter space around the single sink was not ample. There was a wall clock whose loud ticking could be heard in the bedroom. The separate stall shower also was large but its tiles reminded me of a locker room. The toiletries and towels were a bit disappointing--the towels neither large nor plush, the toiletries small (1 fluid ounce each). The bath soap was the same tiny size as the soap for the sink.Overall, this was a great short visit to a great city. The SFMOMA exhibits were worthwhile, and although we missed the Farmer's Market at the Ferry Building, we were able to gorge ourselves at Taylor's Automatic Refresher, Mijita, the Slanted Door, and Hog Island Oyster Co., plus Sear's Fine Foods by Union Square. We wanted to try the renowned Dottie's True Blue Cafe in the Tenderloin, but the line was too long.The Mandarin is yet another worthy luxury hotel to consider when visiting San Francisco."
10,2116,"Sep 1 2009 	What a view!	I stayed for 3 nights in a king bayview room . The third night free promotion made it a little more affordable. Everything about the hotel was first class but the view of the bay from my 38th floor room was sensational. I don't know why they don't put that view on their website as it is not possible to resist it.The only drawback to this hotel is its location in the financial district. On weekends it is pretty quiet in the area ( not necessarily a bad thing) but unless you are a committed walker you are a bit removed from some of the more popular spots. It is about a 15 minute walk to the cable car turntable at Powell and Market, a 25 minute walk to the ballpark. It is actually only a 20-25 minute walk up Sansome to Fisherman's Wharf and no hill climbing on that route which was nice.We did all this walking without any problem but it takes a little more time."
11,2116,"Aug 31 2009 	Wow views don't come much better than this!	We stayed here on the final leg of our honeymoon and it was a great way to end an amazing three weeks around Hawaii. After an awful 7 hour delay arriving from Maui the staff were welcoming and efficient even in the early hours of the morning. Our Bay View room with stunning views and comfy bed was just what was needed. Of course it was the next morning when the views really wowed us. A view right over the bay, taking in Alcatraz and The Golden Gate, we were lucky that it was such a clear day as the common mist which we've encountered on previous trips to San Francisco would have made the room an expensive choice. The room itself was large and comfortable with a bath and walk in shower however the toiletries were basic and nondescript for such a hotel. The location was a good 10 minute walk to Union Square and was based in the business district. As our stay was on the weekend we found the area very quiet and the local starbucks and walgreens was shut the whole time, a bit annoying when you want a coffee or snacks in the evening. I enjoyed my stay here but would probably try a location nearer to Union Square next time."
12,2116,"Aug 29 2009 	It doesn't get much better than this!	We were looking for a delightful hotel as part of a getaway prior to my partner starting cancer treatment, so we chose the MO. From booking to the farewell, every aspect of our stay was a hit. The reservations agent has been there since the property opened and was probably one of the best with whom I ever dealt. We advised the property that we would be arriving early and nature of our trip. Not only was the front desk able to accommodate us straight away when we arrived, but we were treated to some holistic information (with our permission, of course) for managing health pre and post cancer treatment. The personal touch was truly appreciated.As mentioned in earlier reviews, the bayview was stunning. The room was beautiful, spotless and (for us anyway) the Molton Brown toilettries are a hallmark of a great property. The welcome tea and almond cookies were appreciated. Room service was great and any call to the room was answered promptly.It's difficult find anything really significant to squawk about with our stay. On this trip we noticed the MO and another property we enjoyed this trip either had little or no information regarding coffee or tea in the room (even a card in the honor bar indicating coffee/tea must be requested from the front desk or dining room...we are still unsure which it is supposed to be.).The MO delivered on what we wanted for this trip and we both feel calm and focused for our next couple of weeks. Our stay renewed our love for SFO and it would be a pleasure to stay at the MO SFO again once we are able to do so."
13,2116,"Aug 17 2009 	nice hotel maybe more geared to business travellers	Situated on the higher floors of one of the highest buildings in the city we had an amazing view from our bay view room (definitely worth the extras money) from Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, comfortable bed and well appointed bedroom but bathroom a little disappointing - one washbasin, one bar of soap and average toiletry products and towels a little unfluffy. Free internet in the business centre and public areas but not in the bedrooms. At these prices I felt it should be included. Lounge area quite small and dark and seemed to be used largely by businesspeople having meetings. Some examples of exceptional service (Concierge Michael is a star) but some of the reception staff, whilst polite and efficient at all times, lacked that extra special something. For business good choice; for leisure not so sure but the view is stunning!"
14,2116,"Aug 17 2009 	Fantastic views!!	Located in the financial district, everything is closed over the weekend, have to walk that little bit further for coffee, etc. but it's not hideously far. The room is lovely, we were in a superior king room on the 47th floor, views of coit tower and beyond. The room was very nice; bed was comfy; lots of drawers and ample closet space; bathroom was lovely, Molten Brown products; windows that actually open, three telephones, lots of light. Staff all very pleasant and very helpful. Room service quality was good, menu is slightly limited - - especially the after hours menu. There are no movie channels, you can call down and have them bring DVD's up to you for selection - - -I believe these were free of charge. Overall excellent stay, would definitely stay there again. The &quot;California&quot; rate made it worth the money, having to pay full rack rate, I might think differently."
15,2116,Aug 16 2009 	Magical	I spent a week at the Mandarin Hotel in San Francisco and it was amazing. The service is excellent and the staff very friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who wants quality service.
16,2116,"Aug 15 2009 	We would stay their again for the views.	We would recommend this hotel for business or couples but not for families. The rooms are exceptionally clean and include all amenities. The bathrooms are spacious with bathtub and showers. Make sure to book a room with a bay view. The breakfast is a-la-carte and not a buffet breakfast, so everything you order is prepared fresh. Overall a very pleasant experience."
17,2116,"Aug 13 2009 	Terrible Experience	We arrived to the Mandarin Hotel at San Francisco with great expectations. They fell short as soon as we arrived to the room. They gave us a handicap room, which was very uncomfortable. When we called the front desk they argued that the room was not handicap accessible and all of the rooms in the hotel were the same. I asked to speak to the manager and she continued to argue with us. Finnally I request to see other rooms because I could not belive they were all the same and to my surprise they where not. We lost an 1hr fighting about if the room was or not handicap accessible. Finnaly they manager would not even show to apolgize. They changed us rooms but never accepted that the room was actually handicap accessible. Mandarin Oriental is recognize for great service and this was not the case."
18,2116,"Aug 6 2009 	Surprisingly great hotel for young children	We just got back from Mandrin Oriental S.F. Overall:The hotel is truly lovely. The views are fantastic! The room was very nice and very clean. The best part is that they knew I had two young children with me and had toys in the room in advance... and toddler-sized bath robes! The kids felt at home right away, and didn't want to leave.Pros:Welcome tea and almond cookies were wonderful.Staff service great, and personable.Down pillows were not great for sleep, BUT they had memory foam pillows in the closet.Courtesy car.Good location to cable car (the California line cable car does not have long lines like the other cable car lines) and BART (easy access to/fro SFO without having to sit in traffic in a cab).Close to China town and Nob Hill park (for kids to play at).Turn-down service with bottled water.In the financial district, so much, much less touristy.Cons:The very nice tv was unfortunately to the side of the bed, so not great for viewing from bed, but a minor detail. Restaurant (only tried for breakfast) was terrible... chewy pancakes, undercooked egg returned then burnt egg brought out.. ugh!Not convenient walking-distance to good casual restaurantsVerdict: will surely go back!"
19,2116,"Aug 5 2009 	Simply wonderful...San Francisco is a perfect picture postcard outside your windows!	I love hotels. Always have! Pre-internet, I used to write to hotels for their brochures :) That's how much:) But today, this is not enough...and why we are here on tripadvisor.Our first trip away together as a couple had to be something special...and the choice of hotel in San Francisco caused me much research and debating :) Final choice: The Mandarin Oriental...mostly because of the views. We stayed in the Bridge to Bridge suite....And we were not disappointed! On the contrary!! Of course people stay in hotels for different reasons...but to me it has to have something to do with the place I am visiting...and in San Francisco, I think the views are IT!As they say...a picture is worth a thousand words, so have a look at the photos attached...all taken from our room. Enough said!!! :)But I must also add that the staff was faultless...from the Reservations staff (Andrew!), to the reception staff, to the wonderful concierge team - all so efficient, polite, helpful and friendly. They helped us with everything from hiring a car before we had even arrived at the hotel, to securing tickets to a fantastic comedy show, as well as dinner reservations.Room service was also excellent as was the breakfast in the lovely Silk Restaurant .Verdict - A wonderful choice and most recommended :)!"
20,2116,"Jul 28 2009 	Great Hotel	Great service, great room, unbelievable views, good summer deal for an expensive hotel, beautiful bathroom.We just loved everything!"
21,2116,"Jul 28 2009 	Great stay!	My wife and I spent three nites at Mandarin Oriental, for 25 year wedding anniversary, July 24-27th, and we really enjoyed it! Whys:1. We are 'local' bay area residents so we were able to take advantage of the room offer the hotel has for reduced rates. Also, the offer included parking for free and booking through Expedia we got a $50 master gas card! Can't beat that combo2. Views from our room were spectacular--45th floor. Very quiet3. Room was very large and spacious and the bathroom was all marble and huge!4. Service was excellent...people were very friendly. To be honest, i was a bit hesitant to book Mandarin after reading an earlier trip advisor review complaining out indifferent staff, but i saw none of that.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to friends and we (my wife and me) will plan to return again soon."
22,2116,"Jun 18 2009 	Love this place	The Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco is located in a nice quiet area, yet walkable to china town and only minutes to the cable cars. The room was VERY nice (for their standard room) and VERY clean! The hotel is a tall building so it works in your favor as far as views. The only thing I would recommend they work on is customer service. My husband and I rented a car for our day trip to napa valley, we had tasting appointments, etc and the car arrived to the hotel 30 minutes late...we paid $450 to rent the car and for it to arrive late was absolutely unfair. The hotel had actually booked the car later than we asked so it was their fault, yet when I asked to be compensated somewhat for the late delivery, they took my name and number and I NEVER GOT A CALL BACK! I called them several times from my room and they always had an excuse. I would agree with other negative reviews about the bad customer service, very unprofessional."
23,2116,"Jun 2 2009 	Wonderful service and great location with fabulous views.	Since we usually stay at the Mandarin Oriental in NYC, we thought we'd try it on this visit to San Francisco. It is smaller than the one in New York and is quieter as well. The hotel seems to start at about the 40th floor so all the views are fabulous. We could see from the Golden Gate all the way to the Bay Bridge. The rooms are nicely decorated in simple Asian style. The room service is first rate and they never make a mistake with your order. The hotel restaurant (Silks) is 5 star in every way. We had a suite that included 2 full bathrooms. My husband liked the fact that the desk faced a large window. The only little drawback is that there are no good amenities like slippers. There are robes, however. The shampoo and conditioner are very small and are Moulton Brown which is what you find on the airlines. The exercise room is on the 4th floor and is fully equipped. The one thing that will make us return to this hotel is the staff. They make you feel like royalty."
24,2116,"May 26 2009 	Would stay there again - Highly recommend	Exceptional service. The concierge will respond to your every request very promptly and eagerly. I was very impressed with how they responded when I asked if they could get a rental car for me. Within 20 minutes there was one waiting outside the hotel and I just had to sign the contract and take the keys. If you like to not have to lift a finger when you are on a vacation/getaway, this is a great place to stay. Also very clean and comfortable room with a great view."
25,2116,"May 23 2009 	Nice View But Poor Customer Service.	This is a hard to find hotel in the financial district. When I arrived the bellman said &quot; you couldn't park there.&quot; I said &quot;what I am checking in this hotel&quot; he said &quot;you are going to get a ticket.. &quot; I said &quot;Can I get my baggage out of my car?&quot;.. Finally I went to another bellman and said that guy said I cant park her but I need to check in.. He said &quot;sorry&quot; and when and got my luggage. I don't know if the was a language problem or what? But it not the usual greeting I get at hotels. I complained as I checked in and got a cool response apology. It was Valentine Day weekend and stayed in the Lotus Suite. I had flowers delivered and I noticed the bell man had them in his hand in a box.. I quietly said to him why do you have the flowers in your hand in a box, it supposed to be in the room as a surprise. He seemed not to understand as he puts the flower down on the dresser, I ask can I get a vase? It was a weird start to a trip at a 5 star hotel. The trip got better because the Lotus Room was simply beautiful and the view was spectacular out each window. I say through out my 3 day stay, I didn't find the front desk to be that friendly like other 5 star hotels, but the room made up for the lack of good customer service. A week after I the trip I received a request for a customer survey like many hotels send. I gave the hotel great marks besides customer service. When I marked down customer service then the survey ask me why low on customer service and I told them what happen when I arrived. Within a week I received a scolding letter from the hotel customer service supervisor mad because I marked them down in customer service. I couldn't believe it? They were saying will we investigated and they were making excuses for the bellman and said the bellman said he was sorry. Which didn't happen the other bellman said sorry for his co worker. But it wasn't just that incident that made me give low grades on customer service, it was the overall way they treated us. They didn't greet you as you pass the lobby, didn't rush to open the door as you came and they weren't that friendly or welcoming. I wasn't going to write a review on this hotel but when I got a scolding letter from the hotel because I marked them down was very insulting. When I wrote back and told them well I thought the customer service could be better and that I never got a apology from the bell man, they NEVER wrote back or responded to my letter it was like they just want to tell me off about my survey answers. The hotel has great views and the bed felt wonderful but just don't look for excellent customer service!!!"
26,2116,"May 23 2009 	SPECTACULAR BRIDGE TO BRIDGE VIEW!!	My husband and I just got back from a quick stay at the Mandarin Oriental in SF and we loved it!! The service from hotel staff was courteous with exceptional attention to detail, the decor was beautiful, the room was incredibly clean and our &quot;Bridge to Bridge&quot; view room on the 42nd floor was AMAZING!! And the beds were really comfortable. We loved the welcome jasmine tea and cookies too, yes, we're definitely going back! :-)"
27,2116,"May 11 2009 	Loved it!	My partner and I just spent 3 days in the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco. We absolutely loved the hotel and the location was perfect......very central, in walking distance to Market Street.Our room on the 39th floor had a spectacular bay view, the room itself was not too big and had a bit of a weird L-shape but nevertheless was cozy and had a very appealing asian-style decor. The beds were comfortable and bathroom was huge and modern.....reading some of the other reviews here I suppose, it must have been recently updated.The staff was superfriendly, helpful and efficient and we were very impressed by the fact that our rooms was cleaned every day about 5 minutes after we had left, although we never saw any cleaning staff in the hallways.Roomservice was fast and friendly, the only downside was the price for the food and the quality of.You end up paying 80 Dollars for two entrees plus one dessert - one entree I ordered was Spinach Ravioli for 15 Dollars plus all sorts of service fees which summed up to about 25 Dollars in total for that dish and what I got for it was four (!!) ravioli which were arranged nicely around three leaves of fresh spinach - ridiculous!The next day we tried simple penne pasta with tomato sauce which tasted pretty awful, because they obviously used the cheapest ready-made brand of tomato sauce that is available on the market...I had never expected that they would serve something like that in a first class hotel.I have to mention though that we a coupon for 50 Dollars worth of free meals per day....if I'd really had to pay myself for that, I would have felt seriously ripped off."
28,2116,"May 8 2009 	Outstanding views friendly staff good location	The first and primary reason for booking into the Mandarin San Francisco has to be for its views. I took a Bay View room on the 40th floor (there are 8 more floors above that) and the vistas were simply spectacular. You can stand for hours taking it all in - Alcatraz Island, Golden Gate Bridge, Coit Tower, they're all on show.Aside from that I cannot fault the friendliness of the staff. The Conceirge was always happy to oblige, and one of them even gave me his travel pass affording me free tram and other public transportation throughout the city for the duration of my three day stay - can't say fairer than that!The one slight drawback is that it is a little too easy to hear what's going on in adjoining rooms at times but this is a minor quibble.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation."
29,2116,"Apr 27 2009 	Not worth it	I stayed here two nights after a week at the Omni as a 'treat' to myself. I'm sorry to say that my room here cost a lot more and offered a lot less. I won't make that mistake again. As with many high-end hotels, they nickeled and dimed you for everything. Room service was a rip off. Room was not all that luxurious. We got lucky and went out onto a balcony for a view while a staffer was out there, but usually those doors are locked. Fitness room was subpar. Best thing about it was drinks in the lounch downstairs. Overall, a terrific waste of money."
30,2116,"Mar 30 2009 	Way over-priced for what they offer.	My husband and I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for one night in the Mandarin King Bay room in SF. The rooms are nicely and elegantly decorated, and the windows are large and plentiful with good views of the city. I was dissapointed; however, that we did not recieve a room with views of the Golden Gate. I suppose I had to request this seperately. Anyway, the bed was big and comfy. Great pillows; I slept very well. The bathroom was my favorite. It had a large, deep tub overlooking the city. However, the tub is only big enough to fit one person at a time. The service was good; they were very attentive. Although I must warn you, you will get outrageously charged for everything you do. We wanted to eat at an Indian resturant, so we called the front desk and asked them directions to a nearby Indian place. They were very nice, and even printed out directions for us. However, when we checked-out, we saw that we had been charged $6.00 just for having someone tell us where to eat at. We also had room-service ordered. It was $80 for two entrees and an appetizer. Normally that wouldn't bother me if the food was good, but it was not. In fact, I couldn't even eat most of it because it was so gross. I had the pan-seared seabass. It was way over-cooked and was placed ontop of bland mashed potatoes and prego spaghetti sauce. We also had breakfast ordered the next morning. Breakfast was better, but it was still ridiculously expensive. $50 for two breakfast entrees. A glass of orange juice is $6.00! For a hotel that is so high-class, I was not expecting to pay such outrageous prices for something I could get elsewhere for much, much less. Also, everyone expetcs to be tipped. This gets tiring after a while. Oh, I should mention that in the morning we stopped by MO bar to get a water and a coke. The waiter brought out what I thought was complimentary biscottis along with our drinks because we did not request them. If I knew that we would be paying $9.00 for a water and a coke, there is no way we would have stopped at the bar. Overall, the hotel is beautiful and the service is good, but you will pay for it; and you will pay BIG. I will not stay here again. There are other high-class hotels that don't rape every cent out of you."
31,2116,"Mar 4 2009 	One of the best	This is one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had - stunning views of the city, top notch service, and very nice rooms with all of the amenities you would expect from a Mandarin Oriental. The courtesy car was a pleasant surprise and helped us save on taxi fares when going out to dinner at night. Highly, highly recommended."
32,2116,"Feb 21 2009 	Exceptional views and great service	It's a lovely hotel, perched at the top of a skyscraper office builing in the Financial District. Walking distance to most things and a great location. The service is quick and complete. The views from the 1 BR suite were from bridge-to-bridge and simply gorgeous.The food was delicious, although the single restaurant, Silks, seemed to have more diners than waitstaff the day we had lunch there. The room was of a very high quality....not the most luxurious or over the top, but certainly VERY nice. Thoughtfull amenities were provided that made for a special touch.While the hallways are quiet there is little to no way to muffle the crash of closing doors outside the bedroom. The elvators have a long haul to get from the lobby to the rooms and are fast but there can be a wait.The staff was friendly, accommodating and attentive to all needs. It is much nicer than staying in Union Square and a very fine hotel."
33,2116,"Feb 18 2009 	our new home in SF	We visit the Bay area once a year and this time stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 3 nights in early Feb. Previously we have stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, etc, all excellent hotels and no complaints. But we wanted a view, and the M-O has spectacular views, the best in the city, in addition to everything else expected in a first class property. Now we will stay nowhere else."
34,2116,"Jan 18 2009 	First Class all the way	Stunning views from the well appointed and tasteful rooms and excellent service from the friendly staff makes the MOSF a no brainer for a luxury stay in downtown San Francisco.Sunrises and sunsets were awesome from the windows of our 47th floor room. The walk from the elevator to the room thru a glass window hallway gives one of the most breathtaking views of a city I have ever seen.Staff took care of all our requests beyond our expectations. For example, we were able to obtain a table for two at Michael Mina on the day despite a huge crowd of suited conventioneers in town.The hotel has a car and driver available for short trips to restaurants and venues in the downtown area. Its a nice luxury touch and we enjoyed chatting with the friendly driver.Highly recommend this hotel to those looking for a super luxury stay in downtown SF."
35,2116,"Jan 14 2009 	Superior Luxury	Arriving at the Mandarin Oriental San Francisco, I was immediately greeted by a friendly doorman before stepping into the lobby of the hotel. An obsequious front desk attendant checked me in and proceeded to bring me up to my room to show me the amenities. While the hotel is housed in what I was told is the third tallest building in San Francisco, the lobby occupies the first floor while the rooms begin I believe somewhere on the high 30s floors. I had a Queen Bay View Room, located on the 41st floor, which allowed unparalleled views of the Transamerica tower, Coit tower, Alcatraz, the Bay Bridge, and the Golden Gate Bridge. There were so many sights to photograph from the room window alone! Luxe Amenities:Hot tea and cookies are presented shortly after arrival. Two different options for bathrobes: one terrycloth, one chunky waffle weave. Slippers and elegant turn down service nightly, along with bottled water presented bedside. Molton Brown toiletries were excellent. Fabulous points: Concierge was amazing and recommended great places to shop, how to differentiate between the trolleys, cable cars, and other modes of transport in the city, where to eat, and also arranged at the spur of the moment for an almost private tour of the city on an 8-person bus. This tour was exhaustive in terms of the areas we explored and the guide was able to take pictures and provide us with even more suggestions for restaurants and places to visit. The van drove us all over the city and we stopped to get out at the more critical spots. It lasted two to three hours and was a very reasonable $50. Back at the hotel, the fresh apples by the elevator were a nice touch, as was the impeccable service which even extended to the cleaning staff. Concerns:I travel very lightly (I only brought one carry-on and a messenger bag on my trip) but even I was surprised at how little drawer space they provided. There were a few at the bottom of the closet but it was tough to locate any others. There was a floor lamp located near the desk which I needed to use for the added light at night, but I had to plug it in myself (very minor concern, obviously). To access the internet, I had to call the front desk and then was transferred to a tech support line, and surprisingly was never charged the access fee at check-out. Also, one major concern (although it provided a bit of comical relief one morning) was that I could hear EVERYTHING the neighbors did in their room. Now, either my neighbors were very loud, or the hotel's walls need a bit more insulation added in the next renovation. Overall:The views from the room make the stay worth every bit of the cost (which drops drastically if you stay any nights between Friday and Sunday as it's primarily a business hotel). I found the location very convenient to SoMa, Union Square, the Farmer's Market at the Embarcadero, and everything else in the city. However, I would not stay at this hotel if a big draw for you is a bustling hotel atmosphere, particularly at night. This hotel is so amazing in part because it is almost museum-like in its quietness (bawdy neighbors aside). While I am also inclined to visit the St. Regis or the Four Seasons for my next trip to San Francisco, the Mandarin's price drop on weekends, mixed with the superlative quality of the views (and the envious looks you get when you mention where you're staying) make it a must to stay here!"
36,2116,"Jan 5 2009 	Amazing View Courteous Service Total Comfort A+++	Continuing our journey for our Christmas/New Year's Eve vacation my wife and daughter and I just spent 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. It was an amazingly comfortable stay. I booked this hotel over the Ritz and Four Season Hotels which are also great because I'm a sucker for a great view. I'm not sure if it gets much better than this. We booked a Lotus Suite and it had a panoramic view of the city. It was an amazing view both during the day but especially at night. We were on the 45th floor and it was very nice that our room had its own private hallway giving additional privacy. It had a normal doorbell on it as well. The room was VERY spacious.From the moment we checked in the staff was very friendly and professional. I've never stayed at this property before and we were coming from the Ritz Carlton in Naples, Florida and an amazingly upscale house that we stayed in Los Angeles before coming here so we had very high expectations. The hotel lobby is nothing to write home about. Not bad but nothing extra special. The real &quot;magic&quot; begins when you rocket up to your rooms in the fast elevators that take you up to your room. I believe most of the rooms have a view but the suites with the really great views are on the 40th floor or higher. Our King size bed was very very comfortable and had a big floor to ceiling window at the side of it so you can keep the curtains open all night and see the skyline. It was extremely romantic! Also, the room had a nice working area (although this was probably the first time in 10 years that I didn't work during a vacation). We have a 5 month old baby which sure does change your priorities and focus in life. This was a great trip with her and the family. Speaking of which the hotel had a baby crib set up for little Katie.The bathroom was very high end and all marble. The room had high speed wireless internet you could buy. I only used it 1 out of the 4 nights. The cost was $12.95 per night and it did seem to work very well. This place certainly isn't cheap. You can spend quite a lot of money here as things add up. For example, they charged a whopping $50 a night for valet parking. That is a bit steep I thought but then again, all around in San Francisco parking was scarce and VERY expensive. If we didn't have a baby with us and stroller I would never have had a car. Most places charged $27 to park 2 hours and that is IF you can find a space.The room was totally comfortable and I doubt you will find a hotel with a better view in San Francisco than the Mandarin Oriental. They do a great job and always go out of their way to help you. Every morning they put the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and London Financial Times under my door when I told them I read them. The room also has a nice LCD TV and also has a DVD player in it which we used. It is a bit awkward as you can't control the DVD from the bed as it's inside the drawer so they might want to change that. They had twice a day full maid service and they did a great job each day. The first day we flew in it was cloudy and we were disappointed that we spent so much money to get a great view and we couldn't see anything. But then God must have answered our prayers as the rest of the stay the weather was glorious and we got tons of amazing photos near the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, Union Square, Nob Hill and other areas. San Francisco is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I give an A++ for this hotel and the great service as they always were going out of their way to help.We are off back to Los Angeles for a night then heading back to Miami."
37,2116,"Jan 3 2009 	The best views in the Bay Area.	We stayed here because of the height of the hotel and the views we would get. The hotel is on a busy street and as it is in the top half a skyscraper it doesn't have a pulling in area to unload, but the vallet was helpfull and took our car for parking. Check in was easy and the lobby was nice, but not spectacular. The suite was lovely. A seating area, a double bed, plasma screen, large bathroom with tub and shower. Three huge windows with views from the Golden Gate to the Bay. They brought us free tea to drink in the suite on arrival. The concieage reccomened the best eating areas for dinner and provided us with a free Mercedes S Class limo to ferry us around town. He dropped us off at the restaurant and picked us up later. Nice touch. The next morning the conciage suggested a nice place to get Sunday Brunch, and it was great. Very helpfull people. When we checked out after a two night stay we left our un stamped post cards in the room. I called the hotel and they put stamps on an mailed them Free. I thought this was a nice gesture. Overall San Fran has many nice hotels, but I can't think of a simple one that is both Five Star and has these views. It is expensive, but deals are to be had. Or you could book a standard room and ask for a free upgrade, maybe slip the front desk staff a $20 bill, and see what happens. Usually works for us."
38,2116,"Dec 25 2008 	One of the best in SF	We stay here each December over the holidays and it never disappoints. Professional and courteous service, superb views (especially during the holidays) and nice rooms (although the bathrooms are starting to get a little dated). Great hotel...best in the City."
39,2116,"Dec 17 2008 	The Best Service Ever!!	I booked a room at the Mandarin Oriental for my post-engagement proposal night with my new fiance. I reserved a Executive Corner City View room, but was generously upgraded to a room with views of both bridges. I needed time to set up the room, so I was allowed to check in at 1pm which was integral for my evening plans.Once I arrived, the staff was excellent the entire time. The complementary tea in the room was a great touch. I mentioned in my reservation that we were getting engaged, so a beautiful box of chocolates with a &quot;congratulations&quot; label was left for us. The service that we enjoyed was far superior to the Omni and Fairmont that we've frequented in the past.The hotel is expensive, but for special nights, you should definitely splurge and stay at the MO."
40,2116,"Nov 9 2008	Elegant and perfectly Asian hotel	If you've stayed at a high end hotel in Asia you'll know what I mean. The MO is all quiet, discrete but perfect service. The room was nice, a bit small and oddly laid out (I couldn't tell from the exterior but there must be some odd angles to the building).Nice lobby bar with a good selection of food/drinks. Handy location to business in the financial district as well as the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero."
41,2116,"Oct 5 2008 	Great Hotel loved the views	This hotel is a very nice place to stay for anyone. We stayed in the Taipan suite and it was fabulous. As nice a room as you will find anywhere. The terrace was nice but it was cloudy on the days we were there. How unfortunate but I suppose these things happen. The front desk was in shambles though, I waited a long time to check in and they just seemed to lack confidence in what they were doing. Perhaps some training? The front desk is the first and last impression you will have, Its just a shame to have someone leave with a bad thoughts about such a great property. Try the restaurant it is very good. The location wouldn't be that great if you were a tourist but my husband had meetings all day so it worked out well for us. Definitely worth your time and money."
42,2116,"Oct 3 2008 	Fantastic Views	This hotel is in the heart of the Financial District. It occupies the 38th to 48th floors of a block and therefore has fantastic views. We had a bayview room and spent ages just looking out of the window. The hotel supplies binoculars.Service was impeccable, jasmin tea in your room on arrival and assistance with anything you needed. Easy walk to ferry terminal and famers market and Chinatown and well connected for transport elswhere.If 2 people are staying more than one night maybe a king size room would be better but we were only there for one night and the queen size was fineBeautiful bathroom too, stuffed wilth Molton BrownCouldn't fault it"
43,2116,"Sep 22 2008 	Wonderful Stay	My husband and I recently stayed at the MO for two nights in celebration of our 16th wedding anniversary. It was our first stay at a MO property and I booked a Bay View King room via the hotel's website and opted for the rate that included daily breakfast. Our stay was wonderful from the moment we arrived at the hotel's entrance (not that hard to spot as there is a large red banner with Mandarin Oriental on it) until we left two days later. The front door staff were welcoming, the front desk staff were very friendly, competent, and gracious (I liked that they asked what time turn down service should be scheduled), and the concierges were very pleasant and helpful. We stayed in Room 4805 (the hotel's top floor) and were afforded an amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Bay Bridge, the Transamerica Building, and Alcatraz. The room and bathroom were clean although the Molton Brown (sp?) toiletries' scents were a bit overpowering and the towels were not very fluffy or thick as you would expect from a luxury hotel. It was nice that the windows opened and the settee and binoculars were a perfect combo! The room service staff and meals (we had two breakfasts and one late dinner) were all delicious, promptly delivered by friendly staff, cooked just right, and well presented too. Every time we passed by the front desk, the staff always said hello and even knew our names! The tea service that is presented upon check-in is a gracious touch and we also received a delicious box of chocolates from the hotel to celebrate our anniversary - very appreciated! We frequently stay at Relais &amp; Chateau properties when traveling overseas and the MO's setting, amenities, high caliber of staff, meals, thoughtfullness, and welcome setting are on par with R&amp;C properties. We'll be traveling to Tokyo next month and we will definitely consider staying at the MO's Tokyo property based on our recent stay at the MO San Francisco. Thank you for such a nice stay!"
44,2116,"Sep 21 2008 	Great hotel made unbeatable by the staff	This was our second stay at the mandarin oriental and we weren't disappointed. We booked a bridge to bridge room and it was worth the money on the view alone. I do not think there is a finer view anywhere in San Francisco and I think the view from this particular room even beats that of the more expensive bay bridge room we stayed in last time.As you would expect for this standard of hotel the quality of the room and amenities was first rate. The furnishings are exquisite and give a real flavour of the orient. However the one thing that really sets this hotel apart are the staff. Their ability to make you feel welcome and special is unrivalled by anywhere else I have stayed in the world. They are clearly highly trained and have an almost unnerving talent for anticipating your needs. Goven the choice I will not stay anywhere else in San Francisco.Negatives - if I must nitpick i suppose the food and drinks are expensive, but then again would you expect anything else??"
45,2116,"Sep 19 2008 	An above average hotel with exceptional views	We stayed in a bridge to bridge room on the 48th floor (room 4811) for three nights during September. I booked the room expecting spectacular views and was not disappointed. The room was well appointed, of a reasonable size (I had toyed with the idea of a suite but thought the short stay did not warrant it) and generally satisfactory for a chain hotel.An initial word of warning - the hotel is a little hard to spot; if you expect a large frontage you will go directly past it, as we did. Once we found the entrance, first impressions of the hotel were good; we were greeted politely and our car was promptly parked and our luggage unpacked. The first warning of one of the minor problems with the hotel was the wait for the elevator  there are only two servicing the hotel and, while the Mandarin Oriental does not cover all 48 floors of the building, there can be a considerable wait, especially at peak times such as breakfast and dinner.Another note of caution I would proffer is that bridge to bridge rooms all have interconnecting doors with adjacent rooms, thus offering families the opportunity to link more than one room during a stay. This is, of course, of benefit to families wishing so to do, however, for those needing a full nights sleep, the noise that comes through the door can be an unwelcome disturbance  we were woken on two mornings at 6am by our early rising neighbours television. I complained to the front desk, albeit not forcibly, and asked what could be done. Their first suggestion, placing a pillow against the door, was as laughable as it was derisory. Subsequently I was told no other rooms with similar views, I had made this a prerequisite, were available. While I understood and accepted the explanation, I was a touch put out by the lack of apology or indeed the option to upgrade the room.The restaurant on the second floor, Silks, is of a high standard and the meal we had there was one of the highlights of our trip to California  it exceeded our expectations and bettered many of the establishments we visited that had boasted multiple Michelin Stars. The highlight of the meal, indeed three of the four of us dining chose it, was the exquisite scallop and pork belly starter. The sommelier was well trained and recommended an exceptional wine to accompany our meal  in fact he chose something cheaper than the bottle I had sought his opinion on. Breakfast was also of a high standard and I would recommend the Green eggs and ham without hesitation. In addition, the barman at the bar on the ground floor provided excellent service and gave sound recommendations.We found the front desk staff of mixed ability and demeanour. The concierge was a delight to deal with and he helpfully made reservations for us and printed off various pieces of information without hesitation. In contrast, the main front desk team seemed rather inexperienced and some struggled a little with spoken English.All in all, the Mandarin Oriental is a great hotel to stay in if one is visiting San Francisco, however, it is not a destination in itself. The views aside, there are thousands of hotels across the globe that do exactly the same thing at exactly the same sort of price. It is an above average hotel which is perfect for business travellers and those with a reason to be in San Francisco, we were visiting family, but do not make it the focus of your trip."
46,2116,"Sep 18 2008 	Not a good place to get married!	I recently attended my son's wedding at the Mandarin Oriental. The rooms were beautiful -- as a room should be at prices in excess of $300.00/night. The problem was in the dealings with the hotel management. We found them to be inflexible in every way. The wedding took place on a beautiful terrace overlooking the city of San Francisco. After the reception, the professional photographer wanted to take some twilight photos of the bride and groom on the terrace. Unfortunately, the door to the outdoor terrace had been locked, and the hotel representative was unwilling to unlock the door for photographs because, &quot;it was not in the original contract.&quot; This wedding cost well over $20,000, including 8 rooms that were reserved for guests, and my son was charged additional fees for every slight change that was made to the original reservation. There was also an issue involving the suite that my son had originally reserved for his wedding night. He had selected a specific suite because of the view; however, the hotel gave the suite to another guest who wanted to stay in the room for a longer period of time. My son and his bride were given a less desireable room on the other side of the hotel. We were disappointed that the Mandarin Oriental was so unaccommodating when so much money had been spent for this special occasion. Beautiful hotel, but very expensive and inflexible."
47,2116,"Sep 17 2008 	great view pretty good service tired and dirty room	We booked the Bay view room. It had a spectacular view of the bay, the Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz. The room itself was kind of tired. The bathroom was small, had one sink, and didn't feel fresh or particularly clean. It felt old, and the water pressure in the shower was a joke, beyond water saver and into water miser. The service was mixed, some great (room service) and some not so great (front desk.) It definitely wasn't worth the price tag."
48,2116,"Sep 16 2008 	Great Stay	The Mandarin Oriental, San Fran is just simply awesome. I was there with family and we had two rooms on the 42nd Floor. One was a Bridge to Bridge booked through AMEX platinum, so it included a meal credit for $40, which was nice.So here is the low down:LOCATION:It is in the financial district. Not great for tourist. Totally dead at night. You can walk to Chinatown but I recommend taxi at night to anywhere.CHECK-INQuick and easy. They offered us complimentary tea in our room when we arrived at 4:00 pm. The tea arrived with almond cookies around 20 minutes after we were in room. It was nice to relax and sip tea.ROOMSpacious, especially the Bridge to Bridge. Great views. Nice bathtub. Very skimpy on the toiletries. Great bed. Nice 42in Flat ScreenGYMVery small, 4 treadmills and some machines. Nothing special.Overall it was a great stay. IN a different league than the Omni around the corner where I stayed on previous visit."
49,2116,"Aug 31 2008 	Good but not great...	A very nice hotel, by any standards. Very nice rooms and great views. But its not up to par to other Mandarin hotels we visited (Prague, Miami, Munich)... The service was average with no real care or attention... The location is also just ok, but its quite a walk to any sights or shopping...Will choose the Four Seasons or St Regis for our next stay as they are closer to the action..."
50,2116,"Aug 31 2008 	If you're going to San Francisco...	I should have known from the outset when reservations at first agreed and then refused to honour this Mandarin Oriental's stay two nights get one free deal with American Express Centurion - apparently because the room category which we wished to book was too high. As well documented, the hotel occupies the upper levels of a tower block. First impressions were not good - the lobby is dark and shabby and light years away from other Mandarins such as in Miami. Things did not improve when we entered our Dynasty Suite - the rooms were dark and the layout not at all attractive. Whilst the soft furnishings had supposedly recently been upgraded, the decor in the two bathrooms was shocking - poor lighting, seventies' style mini tiles in the shower and the shower head height located somewhere around my chest. On our floor at least, the rooms were laid out in a barbell with approximately six in a cul de sac formation at each end of the hotel. This very quickly became an issue when we became aware of the sound proofing in the suite - there is none. With our bed headboard adjacent to the hallway door, we were consistently bombarded by the thud of bedroom doors slamming closed. Having just arrived from a transatlantic flight, we were looking forward to relaxing and catching up on some sleep on the first few days of our vacation - forget it. The non-stop din of housekeeping and other guests coming and going ensured that we left shattered after three days of disrupted sleep. The dining room, where we had breakfast, continued to same dark and tired theme perpetuated throughout the property."
51,2116,"Aug 30 2008 	Beautiful hotel	I'm a local to the SF Bay area and have stayed here twice (July 08 &amp; Nov. 05) with visiting out of town family. We have all enjoyed it greatly both times. My family stays at many up scale resorts and hotels and raves about this place and I agree with them. Each time we stayed, the rooms were a bit different. We got 2 rooms, adjoining, each time. One for my sis and hubby and one for me and their kids (I'm fill in nanny when they go on vacation...). Their rooms were always nicer than the kid's room, but even the kid's room was superb. The views each time awesome; the master bath astounding, most recently with a bathtub that overlooked the city. The tea upon arrival most inviting and soothing (hot chocolate was provided for the kids and was some of the best we've had). Have a drink in the bar - they have some very tasty and original cocktails. We did not hear any noise either stay. And, yes, it is dead in the financial district on the weekends and after 7 or 8 during the week. If you're into nightlife, take a cab or the hotels complimentary shuttle, if available. Everyone should stay here at least once. It is a little pricey, but worth it in every way."
52,2116,"Aug 24 2008 	Great rooms great views!	I recently spent three nights at the Mandarin Oriental for a quick leisure trip to San Francisco. I spent many hours trying to decide where to stay. On my last trip in June I chose the Four Seasons; it was a superlative experience and a good value to boot. But I wanted something different. I originally booked the St. Regis, but the numerous Trip Advisor comments about noise worried me; the location of the Ritz Carlton does not appeal to me, so sort of by default that got me to the Mandarin Oriental.After reading all the reviews of this property, I can say that I understand both the positive and the negative comments. No hotel is perfect (or at least I haven't been there yet!), so it really depends on what you value for your money. Let me start with the positives.1. As everyone says, the view is unbeatable. I had an executive king with a view south and west. I could see some of the Bay Bridge, but very little of the Golden Gate. If that view is important to you, you need to book a higher category room. Expect to pay $100-200 more per night for that privilege. And, as others have noted, there is no guarantee that you will have that view if there is thick fog, as there was for most of my stay.2. I loved the layout and decor of the room. In fact, I was shown a bridge to bridge room and a Mandarin king (the pricey one) and the living area in my room was more spacious. The color scheme (red, gold, white) is cheerful yet soothing. The furnishings, art work, throw pillows, bamboo plant, sheer blinds, etc. are all lovely. The bed linens were top of the line, really, really silky smooth. Great air conditioning, although I'm not sure I really needed it in the chilly August fog. 3. The hotel is very quiet for a big city. I think being on the 41st floor keeps out a lot of street noise. I heard doors in the halls, but not people, even on a fully booked Saturday night. There are only about 15 rooms per floor, divided by the walkway, so there just aren't that many guests to make noise. Now for the not so good.1. As a luxury hotel bathroom junkie, the M.O. was a bit disappointing. Mine was a bit small, with a very narrow tub. There are appeared to be three types of wall covering, the ugliest of which is in the separate shower. In the other rooms I saw the walls of the separate shower were marble where mine was just ugly yellow tile. The Mandarin King bath with the tub by the window is lovely, but it does not compare to the bath at the Four Seasons. The towels were a bit scratchy and I didn't care for the toiletries. I went from two bathmats on the first day, to one on the second to none of the third. Housekeeping must have forgotten. But the room itself was super clean.2. The public areas of the hotel are sort of dark and pretty small. I don't spend time in public areas, so this didn't matter to me. But the appeal of the hotel is on the upper floors. It's really too bad that Silks has no natural light windows because it is a pretty space.3. I was on a breakfast package so I had two meals in Silks and one from room service. They were okay. Be aware that you are kept to a $32 per per person maximum for the package. At the Four Seasons they just paid whatever I spent (one breakfast upwards of $50). 4. For the non-smokers: this hotel is pretty lax about smoking in rooms. I was told the only floor where smoking was allowed was on the 48th, but there was definitely a fresh cigarette smell in my 41st floor room on Saturday night. One of the staff told me that they don't charge people for smoking in non-smoking rooms as there are a lot of Asian and European clients who smoke. I found this annoying.5. No wifi the rooms, ethernet connection only. Not enough information about TV channels and no info on PPV. 6. The staff did not impress me much. Check in was chaotic -- the person serving me seemed not to know what she was doing, and there was a problem processing my credit card. It turns out it was the M.O. system and not my card, but the 15 minutes spent trying to figure this out was embarassing and annoying. I found the breakfast server unfriendly.But these negatives do not outweigh the positives, and all things considered, I would definitely stay here again. The price was reasonable for a luxury hotel in one of the world's greatest cities, and I really, really loved the room. The pictures posted on trip advisor and on the hotel website are accurate. Enjoy!"
53,2116,"Aug 20 2008 	Loved the Mandarin	We stayed here for three nights with our two teenage children and five year old at the start of our tour of the Californian coast. What a stunning start to our holiday!When we arrived we were met on the steps as we stepped out of our taxi by a young lady who addressed us by our names. She whisked us past the check in desk, straight up to our rooms, and we checked in from there. There was plenty of water for us after our flight, we were offered tea, and there were cookies for the children. The rooms were so beautiful and the VIEW.... well it was staggering.While we were there everyone was so kind and helpful to us. We chatted to the doormen a few times and they went out of their way to help us, it was the same with everyone. They all had a genuine smile for us, it was wonderful.We had a drink in the bar, that was a lovely experience. We had breakfast in Silks which was very nice although quite expensive.One warning - nothing to do with the hotel but on Saturday night it seems like everything in this district is closed. Even McDonalds, can you believe it! We wanted a simple meal out and couldnt find one on foot that didnt involve seafood. We gave up and found a Subway open near the Ferry Building in the end, and walking around at that time of night in an empty neighbourhood was not a great experience. I think it is probably better in other parts of the city to wander at night.Anyway - brilliant hotel, I would recommend it to everyone."
54,2116,"Aug 18 2008 	Lives up to its reputation!	We wanted to stay at a nice hotel in SF and we decided on the Mandarin Oriental, though usually, we try the Four Seasons. We were told by friends that live there that the Four Seasons was in a not very nice area so we settled on the Mandarin Oriental. The service was superb, as expected, very professional and friendly, from the check-in to the concierge and everybody else. The room was very nice, decorated with an Asian touch but modern (mentioning this cause the Oriental in Bangkok was a bit too much for me), the bathroom was huge and had Molton Brown products and the best part was the view. Even though we were not on the best side of the hotel in terms of the view, it was still pretty breathtaking. I loved the small things that make the difference, they brought us tea upon arrival in this perfect looking basket, the room had a flat screen TV and a DVD player so we got a movie to watch on Sunday night. The only thing that I found annoying was the parking, of course there is a garage but it is 50 USD per night, I guess to be expected in that city but I still thought it was a lot. During the weekend, you can park on the street but not on weekdays. We managed to park in another garage for 30 USD, a few blocks away."
55,2116,"Jul 26 2008 	what a view!	Fabulous views from the 38th floor and up. Very comfortable rooms. Very good, friendly service. Very expensive though. Hotel parking at $45 a night?! Come on. Hotel itself needs some refurbishing.elevators and acrpets look a little worn."
56,2116,"Jul 22 2008 	Perfect	We stayed at the Mandarin in San Fran twice - at the beginning and at the end of our trip to the US West Coast. The service - starting from the check-in to the cleaning service - was impeccable, smooth and just perfect. Upon arrival, we checked into a stunning room which had wonderful views across the bay, the Golden Gate bridge and the City. Fantastic facilities. We were greeted with fresh jasmine tea and biscuits.The Hotel's facilities are good - it lacks a health club unfortunately - but we were more than compensated by the service and the room.In particular, Mandarin's concierges are superb. They will go that extra mile to make your stay special. Not only did we receive fantastic recommendations for restaurants (Chaya), they also provided a gift wrapping service and much more.Overall, the staffs' attention to detail is striking and I cannot false the hotel in any way. Make sure you get a room with a view over the bay.Quick summary:Location - very good - you can reach the waterfront, Union Square and Nob Hill in no timeFacilities - good (no health club/spa, but there is one across the street which you can access)Atmosphere - good (it is a business hotel)Service - outstandingRooms - outstanding"
57,2116,"Jul 20 2008	Truly a Five Star Hotel -Service is Impeccable	We loved everything about this hotel. The room had all of the usual perks: the fabulous sheets and tasteful furnishings of a 5 star hotel, but what really set this hotel apart was the amazing service and fabulous views.The view from our room and from the hallways leading to our room on the 48th floor were worth the price alone. The location was within easy walking distance to the wonderful Saturday Farmers market at the Ferry Building (go early and follow the line of people headed for the homemade Mexican breakfast on the back side of the market). The California line of the cable car line is just down the block, pay $11 each and ride to the end of the line and back as many times as you want just for the experience, fun to do very late at night. And a taxi was rarely more than $10 from this hotel to places in town. Deserves every one of its five stars for the accommodating staff."
58,2116,"Jul 15 2008 	Go to the Fairmont!!	I expected alot more from this Mandarin. Management had absolutely no regard for the patrons. They closed the lounge on a Friday nite for a private party without any prior notice to guests and summarily told us to get out. They made no attempt at satisfying us with anything. All we got were a bunch of &quot;I&quot;m sorry's&quot;. Only two elevators and the whole time we were there one or the other was out. Expect a 10 -15 minute wait to get a ride up or down. Do yourself a big favor and, for the money you are spending, go to the Fairmont."
59,2116,"Jul 15 2008 	Perfect Perch for July 4 Fireworks	Stayed here two nights over July 4 holiday weekend in a Bay View Queen, which was a steal at $295 per night. The queen rooms aren't huge, but are certainly comfortable enough and the bathrooms are quite large even in this smaller room category. The absolutely spectacular view, taking in the &quot;greatest hits&quot; of San Francisco--Transamerica Pyramid, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, and the Golden Gate--makes the room feel larger. From my room, I could lie in bed and look at the GG in the distance. I also had a perfectly-framed view of the fireworks down at the Embarcadero. The lobby is smallish, but the greeting staff is top-notch and you will feel like a cherished guest every time you enter or exit. The lounge is just off the lobby and can't quite escape its '80s layout, but there is a great deal of seating so you could usually get a quiet table. Bar staff is professional and attentive. Dinner at Silks, tucked away by itself on the 2nd floor, was a relaxed, calming, and delicious evening. The restaurant's more of a lunch spot, so evenings tend to be quiet. The chef's tasting menu was wonderfully creative and had four well-sized courses plus three amuse-bouche servings, including a post-dessert combo of hot chocolate and bitter German beer that was an innovative meal-ender. I had figured the price was so good on the holiday because of the Financial District location being a bit off the usual tourist path. However, I found the location to be quite convenient. It was a five-minute walk from the Montgomery St. BART station, a ten-minute walk from the Ferry Building [you must try Cowgirl Creamery], and ten-minute walk [straight up] to Nob Hill. If you're a hotel junkie like me, you can explore the Fairmont [lethal rum drinks at the Tonga Room], the Mark Hopkins, the Ritz-Carlton, and the Huntington all in one easy loop once on Nob Hill. Other SF must-dos: Dinner at Gary Danko will leave you reaching for superlatives; Cafe Claude is a nifty French bistro on the edge of Chinatown; a bay cruise under the Golden Gate bridge is awe-inspiring.All in all, even with the many great hotels in SF, I would feel very comfortable returning to the Mandarin Oriental. The complimentary basket of green tea and cookies on arrival set a welcoming tone that continued through my stay. As some others have commented, there was often a wait for an elevator, but that's the only negative comment I have."
60,2116,"Jul 6 2008 	Outsanding!!	Visited this property for the first time on July 4th. The customer service was outstanding! From the moment we entered the small, welcoming lobby we were greeted and promptly helped. The staff was extremely polite and helpful.The room was amazing. Clean. Spacious. View. Bed. Shower. Everything. There was even a refreshing smell as you entered the room that was immediately noticed. Everything in the room was in great shape, perfectly placed and well decorated.Concierge was great helping us find a pub for dinner/drinks and brunch the next day. The only thing we noticed that seemed a distraction was the lack and speed of the elevators. There are only 2 that service the top floors where the hotel rooms are. They were busy and you had to wait a few minutes each way. But, in comparison to the other things this place offered.. it was nothing to worry about!Will return without question."
61,2116,"Jun 30 2008 	Loved this place!	We arrived at this hotel 4 hours prior to check-in time and they still had our room ready for us! Our intital impression of the hotel was that it was very luxurious and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.We had a bridge to bridge room, and as you can see from my photos, we had a spectacular view of the city! The room was immaculately clean, tidy and beautiful. Soon after check in, some Chinese tea and cookies were delivered to us and we were offered a room demonstration (we declined this but it still was a nice touch).We went out for a few hours but made sure we got back to the room in time for sunset, which was breathtaking. We were able to walk to Union Square in 10 minutes.Rooms were equipped with free internet access, a widescreen television and a fully stocked minibar. The bathroom was large and had a walk in shower as well as a bathtub. Molten Brown toiletries were supplied which was a bonus!We decided we didn't want to leave the room and opted for room service dinner. We ordered chicken noodle soup, a cheeseburger, fillet mignon (with garlic fries), and chocolate fondant cakes for dessert. It was quite pricey but delicious and nice for a one off treat. Check out was quick and convienent, with the staff taking good care of our transport requirements to the airport.This hotel was fabulous and I would definitely reccomend that you stay there, even for just one night. I will no doubt be in San Francisco again, and if my budget can stretch to it, the Mandarin will be on the top of my hotel list:)"
62,2116,"Jun 15 2008 	A GEM	What more can you say about the best hotel in town.Everything a good hotel should do for its guests,but this hotel does it better. The staff treat you as family and good friends"
63,2116,"May 19 2008 	Don't telll everyone!	The only place to stay in San Francisco. They say the Queen room is only for business travellers but we thought it was as good as the King. Go for a bay view rooms and you won't be disappointed, it really is worth it!"
64,2116,"May 19 2008 	Brilliant	It was the first stop of our my Honeymoon... booked on site and reviewed. It is expensive but if you can stretch the budget do it. We were on the 48th floor on a corner , the room was fab , staff , very helpful, friendly etc .I would really give this place 10 out of 10. , good central position also."
65,2116,May 14 2008	Excellent	Located in the CBD with fabulous views of the city.We stayed in a bridge to bridge view room on the 44th room. A luxury room with a big bathroom. Couldn't have asked for anymore!The staff were helpful and polite.Great place to stay!
66,2116,"May 10 2008 	A view of the Bridge	We have frequently flown to San Francisco this last year on family business. Of four hotels that we have stayed in we now have a strong preference for the Mandarin.The Mandarin takes up the top floors of one of the tallest buildings in San Francisco. If you stay there you are very likely to have a spectacular water view. That is something that is oddly difficult to find in San Francisco hotels.The service at the hotel is excellent-- fast, unpretentious, quiet and low key. The decor is understated, oriental influenced and well designed with an intelligent lay-out that contributes to the feeling of spaciousness.They handled our rental car quickly and efficientlyIn SF we have stayed at the Four Seasons, the Ritz Carlton and the Omni in the last year and liked all of them except the Four Seasons, (which is grim) but when we return, we intend to book at the Mandarin."
67,2116,"May 5 2008 	Great Stay	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental SF for 2 days at the beginning of our trip to california . This was the 3rd Mandarin Oriental we have stayed at and like the other's it did not disappoint . One of the reasons we chose it was that as we were staying at a weekend it would be quiet in the financial District and we needed a couple of really good nights sleep to acclimatise to the different time zone. That is exactly what we did, the room was very quiet and the bed very comfortable. We stayed in a deluxe room and it was a good size and the bathroom was huge.All staff members we met were very helpful &amp; friendly . Great views from the walkway.The only down side is at the weekends alot of the local restaurants &amp; coffee shops are closed on the weekends, but on weekdays there are plenty of places to go .We would definitely stay here again ."
68,2116,"Apr 29 2008	First Class Service and Views	Originally had a reservation for a Bay King room through the American Express Fine Hotel and Resort program (which would have been upgraded to the Bridge to Bridge room), but found the Seasonal Rate offered directly by the hotel for the Bridge to Bridge room was better, so cancelled AMX and booked directly with the hotel.Views from this room on the 44th floor were spectacular. The room itself was nicely furnished and the bathroom was clean and functional. Only minor complaint is that the bed was a bit soft for me although I'm not sure if it was due to its age or simply the style.Service as others have noted was absolutely first class. Loved the complimentary tea service, front desk, conceirge and valet were all great.The seasonal package provided a $32 credit per person for breakfast, which you'd think would cover a typical breakfast, but it didn't. I found myself going over by $10-15 each day for 2 of us. Food was very good except for the potatoes which were nothing more than diner style hash browns that were cold and tasteless on 2 separate tries. Ordered cream cheese for my bagel and was charged $3.00 for a scoop fitting a weight watchers program. $15 per day for internet access, but didn't need it as my Verizon wireless card worked just fine on the 44th floor.Those who appreciate good service or who want to stare out at Alcatraz or the surrounding areas will not be disappointed. If $3.00 cream cheese or $15 internet bothers you (and it rightfully might given their hotel rates), you may find some minor disappointment."
69,2116,"Apr 6 2008 	Great views	I escaped for one night to San Francisco to visit a friend and unwind, and the Mandarin definitely helped with unwinding with attentive staff and a luxurious room.The hotel is on top of an office building, on floors 40-48, and this means there are some amazing views, especially from the hallway connecting the 2 towers. My room was upgraded from a deluxe to executive deluxe simply by asking at check-in: weekends are slow at this business-oriented hotel. The upgrade meant I got a corner room with 3 large windows and lots of sunlight. Highlights of the room include an extremely comfortable bed and a large, flat-panel, HDTV with actual HD channels on the cable - something many hotels don't bother with. There's also a DVD player attached. The bathroom had a shower stall with great water pressure and a separate tub.Service from the staff was great, with a welcoming tea upon arriving in my room and a well-presented room service breakfast. Sight-seeing suggestions were well described and mapped out by the concierge.The main item lacking from the hotel is a spa. There is a moderate-sized workout room in the hotel, and diagonally across the street is a full-service gym and spa.The location is 2-3 blocks from BART, so access is easy from both Oakland and SFO airports via public transit."
70,2116,"Mar 10 2008 	Hotel staff can't be this good?	Our first stop on a Californian tour in February was this hotel. We booked a twin bridges room, stunning views of the two bridges and the City, way up on the 42nd floor! Our first contact with the Hotel was with Michael Dunlap the Concierge, who planned our stay and eating.We eat at two awesome restaurants, did a touristy city tour, and just soaked up San Francisco from this magnificent and very comfortable hotel.Sure, it is expensive - but the staff genuinely smile with a warmth so special that you feel a million bucks! Nothing was too much trouble...... a great and very comfortable hotel"
71,2116,"Feb 29 2008 	Loved the Mandarin Oriental	Everything about the Mandarin Oriental hotel is service, service, service. This is the way all guests should be treated! Everyone we came in contact with associated with this hotel were friendly and extremely pleasant. The rooms were fine - loved the beds and linens. We had perfect weather which really added to the spectacular views from our room. If you have a fear of heights, this is not the hotel for you! I would not recommend eating dinner at Silks- was not impressed at all. It's fine for breakfast. We will defnitely stay here again!"
72,2116,"Feb 25 2008 	The best hotel I've stayed in while in SF	I found myself in the financial district in San Francisco last weekend without a place to stay and was wandering near the Mandarin, so I stopped in to see what they had in terms of availability.In short, the entire experience was superb from the moment I approached the property to day I left. The doorman was courteous, the bellhop was friendly and the extremely helpful and professional receptionist had me in a room on the 45th floor in short order.Not only was the room fantastic - stunning view, comfortable and inviting bed, impeccable furnishings - the service was top notch as well. From chatting with me, the receptionist gathered I'd flown in recently and had the concierge contact me to inquire if I'd eaten. After telling him I had not, he quickly managed to procure a reservation for me at an amazing spot *and* got me great table as well (which I don't know how he managed, given the place was absolutely packed).Simply put, if you feel like being pampered, check out the Mandarin Oriental."
73,2116,"Feb 25 2008 	My second stay in as many months	My first stay in January was so nice that I rebooked with them on my next trip to SFO (in February). The front desk staff made a point to welcome me back and thank me for my continued business. I definately knew I had made the right choice staying here again.I love the complimentary hot tea they deliver right after you check in, and the room service attendants are always very friendly and polite.This trip my room was on the 44th floor and the views are breathtaking! The binoculars in each room are a nice touch and the beds are high enough that you can sit in bed and see the bay as well as traffic on the bridge.Nice fitness center, great business center (above average in my experience with hotels) and even the restaurant - Silks - is great."
74,2116,"Feb 18 2008 	great hotel	i stayed at the mandarin oriental on a friday night...check out their website...they might have weekend specials. anyway...i stayed so that i wouldn't have to drive home after theatre. the hotel is located in the heart of the financial district which is quiet on the weekends and it's within walking distance of sf's finest shopping...chinatown is within walking distance too... it isn't that close to the theatres...but...a short taxi ride. the room was incredibly clean and the furnishings were in very good condition. the bed was very comfortable, the room smelled fresh...not like lysol. the bathroom is marble with a shower ad tub. have you seen pic's of rooms that looked great...but...when you see the real room its &quot;shopworn&quot; and dingy around the edges...well...the mandarin was spotless. the view was spectacular...all the rooms start on top floors... parking was a bit pricy...but...very convenient."
75,2116,"Feb 15 2008 	Always a great stay...	Every time I visit San Francisco I try to stay at the Mandarin. My first visit just blew my mind and things have not changed with age.This visit nearly did not happen due to an email miscommunication between myself and a member of the MO team. But we managed to resolve our differences very amicably (and all my own fault really) and I got the room I wanted for an acceptable price.It has to be said the MO is not cheap. Especially when you are a leisure traveller and not on business expenses! But the service is exceptional, the MO people always appear genuinely pleased to see you and make your stay really pleasant. You feel special every time you walk in.After service and hospitality the next best thing is... the views. This hotel has the best views of San Francisco you have ever seen and an upgrade to a room with a Golden Gate view is well worth it. The views are indescribable. I knew what to expect, but it still takes my breath away, my girlfriend had not been and was, as I anticipated, stunned! As I did on my first visit, she sat and drank in the views for an hour after we arrived :-)I do love the place and will always try to visit if and when I am in the area although I would note there are one or two very small niggles starting to appear. I doubt they will remain for long and do not spoil anything but things like the heat lamp timer in the bathroom being from the 80's and the TV speaker in the bathroom not working were surprising. But Ia) who really needs those things and b) I repeat... the hotel is still fantastic!The turn down service is wonderful and when you return in the evening it feels like home (although I urge you to open the curtains again to take in the sensational night time city view).Being in the financial district the hotel is well placed for all transport, including a tram at the end of the block. Close to the bay and very close to the main shopping centres. Not so close to Fishermans Wharf but that's not such a bad thing.I can't wait to return :-)"
76,2116,Feb 10 2008 	Best Choice for Honeymoon	The Mandarin is a wonderful hotel. My wife and I stayed there after getting married before leaving to Hawaii and we were treated very well. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are great. We stayed in the bridge to bridge room and it was a wonderful site. Very romantic and a great choice.
77,2116,"Jan 12 2008 	Simply - THE BEST!	Boy, it's going to be tough to write this review. I am not sure I can gush enough about this fine hotel.When you drive up, the hotel is not overdone, it's simple. The hotel sent a car to the airport for us and the car alerted the hotel we were coming. The manager and a assistant greeted us on the sidewalk.Our check in was done in the room, we never had to stop by the front desk. Then hot tea arrived the room with Asian cookies. The kids had stuffed animals and baseball caps on their beds!We had two rooms, the larger room had a stunning bay view. Our bathroom had a tub that overlooked the bay. I can't tell you how relaxing it was to soak in a hot tub and have the whole city of San Francisco below you!This is one hotel I could just sit in the hotel room and never leave.The service is top rate. You don't have to ask for anything, some how the staff seems to understand what you need and they do cartwheels to make you happy. The staff in my view is one of the best group of hotel employees in the world.The concierge staff is the best in the world. They suggested restaurants and treated the kids like family. We were offered the hotel car for dinner and never had to get a cab to go anywhere.This is exactly what a dream hotel stay should be. Perfect rooms, wonderful views, attentive staff and San Francisco. I can't describe how perfect our stay at this hotel was....I can't wait to go back!"
78,2116,"Jan 8 2008 	The best view in San Francisco	To put it simply, the Mandarin Oriental is as good as its hype - if you're going to San Francisco it's really worth paying the extra. The view from our room on the 45th floor was simply the best view from a hotel I have ever had. We could see all the way from the Golden Gate Bridge round to Alcatraz, and from the sky bridge (which you cross when coming out of the lift) you can see the other side of the city too. Being used to staying in small hotels with no view whatsoever in New York, this was a real treat!The room has lovely facilities and a huge bathroom with a big bath (which makes a change from those small, shallow ones) with a separate shower cubicle. Nice comfortable bed and good (quiet) air con.Very nice service, although the restaurant was closed so didn't get a chance to try that out. Booked directly with the hotel website as that was the best rate.Will definitely stay here again when in San Fran, would miss the view too much to stay anywhere else!"
79,2116,"Jan 6 2008 	You'll love the attention to detall at the Mandarin Oriental.	My husband and I recenlty stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco. We have stayed at M.O. before in New York and fell in love with their attention to service. Upon arrival we were greeted warmly and offered complimentary tea service. We asked for early check in and were granted early check in at 11:00 a.m. We were greeted by hotel employees as we entered and exited the hotel. They were very warm and friendly and even greeting us by name. Our room had a wonderful view of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Coit Tower. We had our tea service in the afternoon after a day of shopping. The tea pot arrived in a large basket along with almond cookies. After we came back from dinner, cold water was waiting for us along with slippers next to our bed. We had a wonderful stay. My only issue was our neighbors who departed in the middle of the night. They were very loud and entered and exited their room several times before departure. The clock alarm also went off at 5:00 a.m. so I guess the last guest forgot to turn it off. I finally took the battery out since I couldn't figure out how to turn it off at 5:00 a.m. in the dark. Minus these few events which the hotel had no control of we had a great stay. I would advise that some local restaurants were closed when we arrived. I believe that since this is a business area that some small restaurants are closed on the weekends. This is not a big deal since you will want to experience the wonderful restaurants in other parts of the city especially Micheal Mina at the Westin St. Francis. Hands down my favorite restaurant. The attention to detail at this restaurant is amazing. The lobster pot pie is to die for. When we departed the hotel we were offered coffee to go."
80,2116,"Jan 1 2008 	Superb views	We stayed here on the last night of our trip from New York (we drove across, via Seattle) as we decided that we deserved some luxury after all those middle-of-nowhere motels! We booked a Bridge to Bridge room which had a 180 degree view from the Golden Gate to the Oakland Bay Bridge, and it really was amazing! The hotel itself is in the business district but the area had quite a lot of parking which was a bonus. We decided to take full advantage of our room so didn't venture out into the surrounding area, however as we were there on a Sunday night everything seemed very quiet when we drove in. The ground floor reception area is nice, clean, modern and well decorated with a very polite reception staff who booked us in quickly and with no fuss. The ground floor has a nice bar/lounge area where they serve lovely cocktails, a great variety of wines and delicious (complimentary) snacks of nuts and olives. I have to admit that my one reservation about staying here was also the main reason for the stay - the height. The room was on the 42nd floor which gave it such beautiful and stunning views (from the large windows as well as the glass walled corridors) but also meant a long elevator ride, which for a claustrophobic was quite a daunting prospect. Thankfully, the elevators are large and airey and speed directly to the 40th floor (they don't stop before this as the first 39 floors are offices) so the experience was pretty painless! The rooms themselves are wonderful with large, comfortable beds and sparkling, well laid out bathrooms. We ordered room service and spent the evening eating incredible stone baked pizzas and drinking champage whilst admiring the view and it is an experience I would highly recommend. The complimentary binoculars were very much appreciated and came in handy for zooming in on Alcatraz and the Bridges. All in all, this a wonderful place to stay, it's extremely comfortable and whilst it may be a little more expensive than other places the views make it worth every single penny. I would definitley recommend the Bridge to Bridge room for a great night!"
81,2116,"Dec 17 2007 	A fantastic hotel! Exceptional service	I stayed at this hotel for four nights in October 2007. It is one of the best hotels available in terms of personal service.The location of this hotel is in the financial districts -- very close to most things. The entrance to the hotel is not exactly grand: it is after all not a huge property. But the rooms are lovely and spacious, mostly on high floors, with spectacular views towards the Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz. The service is truly exceptional. The doorman recognises me and greets me by name each time I go through the front door, which is a nice touch. The gym is ... well, not so wonderful. It's small and tucked away in a room the size of a broom cupboard. But otherwise, delightful stay."
82,2116,"Dec 13 2007 	still the best in SF	The MO San Francisco still rates a mostly five star rating from me. I always return because the hotel is subtle, quiet, great service, great views and food.Pros: Everythinga) check in flawlessb)views amazingc)quiet..............most SF hotels are noisier.d) tastefule}great food The only &quot;con&quot; is that the Mandarin Suite is next to the elevator. I have stayed in it now four times and I am lucky that the master bedroom is away from the elevator. Being noise prone, I am safely away from the elevator sound. The second bedroom is lovely but nearest to the elevator and with the proximity comes noise. Amongst all the others in SF, the MO is and has been for me always the best. Not to trash the others, in comparison to the Ritz (tired rooms with no views), the Four Seasons ( nice enough but with Hilton tendencies).........this is a lovely respite in SF.This is the best hotel in SF. The one bedroom suites are on higher floors with even better views."
83,2116,"Dec 11 2007 	Could not have Asked for More	Where to start, everything about this hotel was wonderful. The front desk staff was charming and friendly. We had booked through American Express Fine Hotel and Resorts Program and received an upgrade from a bay view queen to an Executive Corner King. Staff sent up Jasmine Tea and a bottle of Cabernet within a few minutes of checking in. Turndown service was wonderful and was available until 9:30 at night, which was perfect for us since we were not meeting friends until 9. Every time you walked in or out they welcomed you. We had breakfast at Silks both days which was wonderful, they have a bunch of specialties everyone should try (the chicken hash was out of this world). We were fortunate and were on the top floor, the 48th, the views were out of this world. We had friends over who lived in San Francisco and they could not believe how far you could see. Everything about the room was top notch, flat screen TV, Molton Brown toiletries, sheets so soft that you didnt want to get up. The immediate area is quiet on the weekend, but walk 5 blocks and you are at Union Square, Ferry building, etc. Overall, a top notch hotel, in a wonderful city."
84,2116,Nov 29 2007 	excellent	&quot;only four days&quot; beautiful room with just incrededible service they even let us use the hotel car (lincoln) for short hops. just the best! if you can afford it . do it.
85,2116,Nov 27 2007	Wow what a Place!!	Fantastic!! What a great place!! Everyone sooo friendly and nice. We had kids with us and they were most welcome. Brilliant views (3rd tallest building in SF) we could see the Golden Gate bridge from the bath tub!! Great Food! Good Service and a wonderful place to remember!
86,2116,"Nov 5 2007 	Mandarin Oriental was a perfect hotel!	The service we received at the Mandarin Oriental was outstanding! Absolutely every employee we spoke with was extremely helpful and friendly. Our room was gorgeous overlooking the Bay Bridge. We were impressed with all of the details - from the slippers and bottled water left next to the bed, the lavendar satchets left on our pillows,and all of the wonderful amenities. We had breakfast in Silks, and thefood and service were exceptional. This was our second visit to the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco, and we would highly recommend thishotel!"
87,2116,"Oct 26 2007	Perfection with an upgrade	Stayed in the magnificient Oriental Suite for one night after being upgraded from their top deluxe guestroom. I had just checked out from the Ritz Carlton where my Louis Vuitton had been damaged after someone sneaked into my suite and tried to open the locked suitcase. The MO is superb despite a not so attractive location in the Financial District. Staff is great, nice without being snooty, service is excellent and the views are to die for. The in-room amenities are excellent and I wish I would have satyed longer to enjoy the space and views from my room. Look at the pictures and you will understand."
88,2116,"Oct 3 2007 	Quite a disappointment	I stayed for two nights during the Annual meeting of the American Dental Association. Because of the high rate of attendees in the city the hotel charged the full rack rate of $610.00 per night. For this we received a spectacular view but that is where the good things ended.We checked in and recieved the high end service of being called by name and escorted to the elevator by the &quot;lobby ambassador&quot;Shortly after check-in we ventured out for dinner. It took 35 minutes for the doorman to get a cab for us. We learned later that the hotel promotes a car service that they bill directly and as a result cabbies are reluctant to service them. What we discovered later was the car service, billed through them was double the price of booking it on your own.After returning from dinner we opened the door to our room and a tremendous amount of particles rained down upon us from the vvent located directly above the door. Our clothes literally looked as if we had been out in snow. The particles were also pulled through the room creating a layer of dust over everything.After many calls the manager came to the room and assured that this was a result of filters being changed that day and the particles were not harmful. He also assured us that the room would be thoroughly cleaned the next day. For our inconvenience we were to receive breakfast and an adjustment to our $610.00 rate. What we got was a basket of cold pastries, a pot of coffee and a $40.00 adjustment.My schedule requires travel 20 nights a month and I can assure you this property will never be on my list. High rates in San Francisco are understandable but calling my by name and escorting me to the elevator does not take the place of making things right when things go this wrong."
89,2116,"Sep 10 2007	MO compares favorably to Four Seasons 	My two favorite hotels in SF are the MO and the Inn Above Tide in Sausalito. I've stayed in the Four Seasons and the Ritz and many other hotels in SF. Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me.I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view.The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet.Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area.The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.Overall, the hotel is worth splurging for the best rooms and we plan to come back every summer."
90,2116,"Sep 5 2007 	Incredible Hotel - it makes memories!	My wife and I just experienced a couple of days at the Mandarin Oriental. The hotel is the best hotel that we have ever experienced - truly a 5 star. We were fortunate to have a room on the corner of the 45 floor and the views of the bay and city were spectacular. I cannot imagine any better views within the city. This was our first trip to explore San Francisco and we could not have been more pleased with our hotel experience. Room - outstanding from every perspective! The size of the room is huge - a spacious seating area with chairs and sofa, desk for business or internet use with an incredible view of the city all the way to Monster field. The hotel even provides binoculars to provide a close up view of all the city and the room has three large windows that almost provide panoramic views. The decor of the room is gold and black asian theme that is very tasteful and well done. The room is so spacious in ever way including the closet, built-ins for luggage, and a very large bathroom. The room has a large LG LCDTV that swivels for the entire viewing from any angle. A DVD player is also provided along with CD/radio for music and alarm. The window treatments were awesome in that there was a transparent screen and blinds with the Mandarin logo for allowing light in, but shielding the sun at the same time. The windows do open which was nice to allow some air into the room, but also allowed in some noise from the city below. Nice touch, but I would not think that many would open windows 45 floors up... The bed is elevated to allow you to enjoy the views out of the windows from the bed and the bedding is top notch. I normally do not sleep well in hotels when traveling, but this bed and bedding provided the best night's sleep ever - outstanding! The bathroom was quite large with separate large shower, tub, and plenty of space for everything. All of the accessories that you could imagine are provided down to the bathroom scales. Every detail was well planned and executed to the light switches for turning on/off lamps beside the bed. Everything was at your fingertips including a single remote control that controlled multiple electronic devices. We were delivered hot tea and cookies of our choice upon check-in. Turndown service provides house shoes, cloth on the floor for stepping into an out of bed, robes, window treatments closed, turndown, music, etc. the list goes on - dimmers on all lights, etc. Other minor details - the iron was the best ever at a hotel - high quality every place - marble and stainless in the bathroom, the soap and shampoo, etc.The elevator was extremely fast and the walk from the elevator across the bridge or connector provides the best views in the city - bay and city views - fabulous! I used the workout facility and it was very nice - TVs on the equipment with headphones provided - my only complaint for the workout facility was the treadmills did not provide any space to hold a bottle of water - you had to place on the floor which caused interruption in workout to stoop and get a bottle of water... They provided chilled water, apples, bananas, plenty of towels, very nice equipment with the exception of the treadmills as noted.The staff were very nice and would do everything to accommodate our requests. The concierge made Alcatraz reservations and made very good dinner recommendations outside of their hotel restaurant - Silks. We wanted to experience some of the other places for meals and did not dine at Silks within the hotel. Cons - valet parking is $50 per day - very pricey, but about the norm in San Fran. For the price of the daily room rate - it should include high speed internet - I think requiring additional $12.95 per day is ridiculous since every thing else is incredible. First impression - the lobby does not provide the overall first impression that you would expect from a 5 star hotel, but wait until you get off the elevator and move to a room before you judge the hotel. This hotel does not the have the marvelous lobby of the Fairmont per se, but the rooms are out of this world as compared to any other hotel in the city.I highly recommend the Mandarin Oriental for your next stay in San Francisco."
91,2116,"Aug 30 2007	Good - but ........	The Mandarin Oriental was an interesting hotel. We sort of liked it, but didn't which seems rather vague I know! We stayed in a Bridge to Bridge room and our son was in a connecting Bay View Room. The rooms were great although a little small (long and narrow). The weather was not too good and we didn't really get the benefit of the fantastic views due to mist and fog, although this was nothing to do with the hotel!When we arrived we noticed that the lounge area was shrouded by black curtains as they were refurbishing the lounge. This was news to us and we hadn't been adivsed of this beforehand. We like to have a pre-dinner drink in a lounge so this was a disappointment to us as it was dim and gloomy.On two evenings we asked the front desk to book a restaurant for us. On both nights (although we were told verbally they had been booked) they hadn't which was rather disappointing and caused us a bit of hassle at the restaurants we thought we had booked.Finally, it was our wedding anniverary when we were there and this wasn't acknowledged either although our tour operator had told the hotel so. Pretty poor customer attention we thought.This may sound like doom and gloom but we are hoping that we were just unlucky, So don't be put off!! We like to give a balanced view, so there were good bits - good location, good bell boy and a brilliant view we are sure had the weather been on our side!!"
92,2116,"Aug 28 2007 	Another fantastic visit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	My husband and I have just returned from another 4 days at the Mandarin. All I can say is WOW!! We opted for a different room this time, the Bay Bridge King as we found the Mandarin King a bit too pricey. Well the room certainly did not let us down. Once again it offered, a huge bedroom with wall to ceiling views of Coit Tower, Alcatraz and the Bay Bridge. The bed is unbelievably comfortable with plush down and comforter. The room is serviced twice daily and is absolutely immaculate. The bathroom towels are constantly replaced with fresh ones, morning and night. This hotel is marvelous, loosen the purse strings and enjoy its definatly worth it!!!"
93,2116,"Aug 15 2007 	Yes we are Fans of the SF MO	My husband and I booked a two night stay at the SF Mandarin Oriental as a capstone to our anniversary trip to the Wine Country. We could not have felt more welcomed and special than the staff at the MO madeus feel. Upon arrival, our luggage disappeared to the mystical porter zone, and the front desk staff all greeted us and WELCOMED us by name. They wished us a happy anniversary and to a man they offered advice on things to do, places to see, making sure our stay was a pleasant one. By the way, their recommendations were spectacular!The hotel offers a complimentary car service (as available), but we really wanted to explore SF on foot, so they provided a street map and reminded us to call back if our feet became weary.Our room was a Bay View King (a complimentary upgrade!) and our unobstructed views of San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz, Golden Gate Bridgeand Coit Tower are memorialized in our photo album. Such tremendous vistas! This location is hard to beat!Room service sent up a complimentary pot of tea and the hotel also thoughtfully provided a lovely tray of sweet treats emblazoned with a chocolate anniversary greeting. We felt like visiting royalty. The room itself was beautifully appointed, looking exactly like the website's photo. Truth in advertising, what a rarity!We were so glad that our early request of arrival time was accommodated (1:00). It was so nice to settle into the room after the drive from Sonoma. The hotel's website has an extensive menu to determine your preferences.The hotel delivers on so may levels. The in-house restaurant, Silks, was an oasis of fine dining with entrees creatively and masterfully prepared and presented. The bar area downstairs was so chic and comfortable; we loved stopping in for a glass of wine after a day's shopping.We had heard that every member of the staff makes an effort to ensure your visit is a memorable one. We agree wholeheartedly with this observation. We'll return, we'll recommend it, we'll treasure our San Francisco memories. Thank you Mandarin Oriental!"
94,2116,"Jun 29 2007 	Great from start to finish	This hotel made me soooo happy! We stayed there the last few days of more than a weeklong vacation and had already stayed in the Bellagio (Las Vegas) followed by two Best Westerns (California coast). Once our taxi pulled up to the Mandarin we didnt have to lift a finger to do anything except hoist martinis and shop for a few days. I always consider it a good sign that while we pay the taxi driver, our luggage miraculously moves to the bell captains desk, and the front desk staff addresses us by name when we walk into the lobby. The service at the Mandarin was impeccable, the room was fabulous, the staff courteous and perfect. We had a bridge-to-bridge view room which allowed us to see the entire bay from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate. The only obstruction was the Transamerica Pyramid which was very close by. Our room was on a corner and had huge windows. You could lie in bed (watching the big flat-screen TV) and see the skyline. The one drawback to our type of room, high up with great views, was that no one wants to close their curtains. If you arent careful you can see other people in their rooms, and they can see you. This is just something to be aware of. I mean, the room comes with binoculars so it is no surprise that a bit of people watching occurs. The bathroom was quite nice. There was a volume control on the wall by the sink so you could hear the TV or CD player in the next room while in the bathroom. The speaker was under the sink. I have stayed in a lot of hotels, but I have never seen this feature before. The hotel had great towels, robes and slippers, and Caswell Massey toiletries. Like many nice hotels, the room included a complimentary umbrella to use while in town. These may seem like minor things, but they certainly cut down on the amount of stuff you have to pack. Overall, the room was pristine  it was like we were the first people to stay there. I always want a hotel to be so nice that I am tempted to stay in my room rather than go outside. This is definitely one of those hotels. I would go back again and again."
95,2116,"Jun 28 2007 	One of the best hotel chains in the World	I have had the pleasure of staying at three Mandarin Oriental Hotels around the World. They are one of the best in the world when it comes to service. I have been to their hotels in Oahu, and Hong Kong and if you have the opportunity to stay at a Mandarin Oriental book it, you will not be disappointed.The quality of service, the attention to detail and the comfort of the rooms are fantastic. The appetizers and drinks at the lobby bar are great. I took my wife here in the fall of 2006 and as mentioned several times the views from the sky bridge is breath taking. The fall is my favorite time of year to visit SF."
96,2116,"May 20 2007 	A great view is not everything...	First the best: The overview was very great, from golden gate bridge to bay bridge, alcatraz in front, very very beautiful...The rest is not that, I expected from a hotel that price. A fire alert in the middle of the night and no one from the hotel was interested to tell us, if we have to go out or stay at our room at the 46th floor - high enough to get panicky a little bit - about fourty minutes later a fire fighter arrived an told us - on request - they don't know any fire, they don't know, where the alert comes from and they don't know, what to do. The hotel stuff was not interested in helping them or any other guests. The next morning the stuff at the reception nearly couldn't remind, that anything happened the night before. The stuff couldn't remind, that we had a reservation with romantic package - containing some champagne and breakfast - very ignorant.And the housekeeping wasn't interested in filling up the amenities for the second night. I don't mind, so we could clean our ears just the one day.All in all, we do not recommend the hotel, exept for the view."
97,2116,"Apr 30 2007 	I am a Huge fan!	I stay in this hotel quite often on business, but also use it for occasional leisure stays. Service is absolutely top notch, and I find one of the reviews below which says you are treated as number in a computer curious at the very least and downright slanderous at worst. The staff goes out of their way to address you by name and provide as much or as little service as you wish.The criticisms of the bathrooms, however, are quite accurate. They were not refurbished in the recent remodeling and should have been. (One pet peeve is that the towels are not as luxurious as other luxury hotels I have stayed in, but that's sort of a minor issue.)The only other criticism I have is that while the TV's have all been updated and are plasma screens, the hotel has no movies on demand (yet, I am told).Other than the above, you will find finely appointed rooms, friendly and accomodating staff, and some of the best food in the city at Silks, the onsite restaurant. While some below criticize the size of the public areas, you should keep in mind this is a boutique hotel with no more than 110 rooms. That is a plus if you are looking for excellent service, as the small size allows the staff to attend to the guests. The lounge and bar are well-appointed and service is phenomenal.Other criticize the small workout room, but the fact is, it is seldom used and it is like having your own personal gym. Moreover, passes to Equinox Health Club &amp; Spa across the street are available, as well as passes to numerous other health clubs throughout the city.I have stayed in almost every other major hotel in the city, including the Ritz Carlton, the Omni and the Mark Hopkins. When given a choice, I always choose the Mandarin Oriental. It is simply the best hotel in the city."
98,2116,"Apr 6 2007 	Best views nicest room - ever	Stayed there with my husband new year's 2006/07 for 2 nights.When we arrived, we got an upgrade to an executive/corner room on the 48th floor.The rooms start on the 36th floor, so there are no rooms without a view either over the city, or the bay.Everything in this hotel is spectacular, where to begin..Check in, great. Nice, friendly.Elevator doesn't stop before the hotel floors, so they are really fast. Very short walk to the rooms since the elevators are in the middle. There's a spectacular glass bridge in the middle of the hotel between the &quot;city&quot; and &quot;bay&quot; halves of the hotel - incredible views.ROOMRoom is astonishing, in a wonderful modern &quot;asian&quot; decor, all style and comfort in wood/gold/red, hidden lighting, chaiselongue, flat screen/DVD/Hifi, binoculars etc.The view is fantastic - from Bay to Golden Gate over the whole city.Huge marble bathroom with nice bathtub and a large walk in shower with stone tiles. Nice produces, all is super clean, nice bathrobes and all you can expect to find.Very comfortable bed with a wonderful view (yes, from the bed) over the city. Breakfast was great, very nice staff.LOCATIONEven though it's deserted on weekends, it's only an 8 minutes walk to the main city area and feels safe even in the evening.Minor PROBLEM: we were told breakfast and parking was included, but it was not.Another minor problem was immediately taken care of."
99,2116,"Apr 2 2007 	Loved my stay	My boyfriend took me San Francisco for a romantic get away. From the moment we stepped into the hotel he had everything especially set up for us. Our incredible suite was perfect and he had the staff arrange pink rose pedals in a heart shape on top of the bed, so romantic. The view was amazing and the staff was wonderful. The bed was so soft and comfortable. Room service food is normally okay but here was fabulous. I love this hotel and will definitely come back. It is very pricey though so to have this experience you might want to keep that in mind but WORTH EVERY PENNY."
100,2116,"Apr 1 2007 	Perfect Birthday weekend	We were here for a long weekend to celebrate my wife's birthday . Our greeting upon arrival was very warm and check in went without a hitch . My room requirements were done perfectly . Our dinner reservations at French Laundry and Gary Danko were arranged before hand by Jacque the concierge . Our bridge to bridge bay view room had a incredible view . The rooms had been nicely refurnished . I wouldn't be concerned with the bathrooms not being up to 5 star standards . They were more than adequate. Our bed was the most comfortatable bed we had ever slept in . This hotel is for those who want the best hotel views of the bay and for those who want the best service . Its in a very quiet part of the city which is perfect for our needs . The lobby needs a lot of work but I did find out that its being renovated soon .The service was perfect in every matter . My requests were easily handled . I should mention that this was our 3rd stay in a Mandarin Hotel in the last year, the other 2 being in New York City.The San Francisco Mandarin is far better in service and comfort than that of New York . We look forward to returning to this Madarin . They do a perfect job here ."
101,2116,"Mar 18 2007 	Fantastic Stay at the Mandarin Oriental	My boyfriend and I were fortunate enough to spend two days at this wonderful hotel on our return from our vacation. We were delighted to have been upgraded to a corner room on the 44th floor where the views were just stunning, it almost seemed a shame to leave the room. The service throughout our stay was efficient, friendly and unobstrussive. I would also like to recommend an Italian restaurant that we came across by chance - it is called Cafe Tirmamisv [-], the service was impreccable and my partner had the best steak he had ever tasted."
102,2116,Mar 7 2007 	Anniversary Spot	Absolutely beautiful. Awesome location. Nice food. Service is good. Room size is little small. I would recommend it for a romantic getaway.
103,2116,"Feb 21 2007 	a view that can't be beat	Stayed for 8 nights on a trip partly for a job-related conference. The bridge to bridge view was breathtaking-coming back from a full day of activities and seeing the awesome landmarks of the city in a comfortable, quiet and well appointed room can't be beat. The staff was top notch and at a 5 star level.As far as criticism, I didn't mind the decor as it still looks in good taste and not tacky in any way. There is no good bar or lounge in the hotel, but my spouse and I were happy to explore the city for restaurants and bars. The atmosphere feels private and secluded which was fine with us. However, some may feel that they want more &quot;character.&quot; There are a variety of high end hotels in this tourist oriented city, but we would be delighted to stay here again on our next trip..."
104,2116,"Feb 15 2007	Five Stars ... BUT	I stayed in a bayview queen in February 2007. People gripes and compliments regarding this hotel are both actually pretty accurate. This is essentially a boutique property, with a small lobby, lounge and restaurant on the first two floors of a high rise, with the rooms at the top of the tower.The public areas are small, and good looking enough, but for some reason feel very impersonal, and lack lounging space.The rooms, while not large, are not too small, but are beautifully decorated in a mixture of European and Asian furniture. The bedrooms are essentially like jewel boxes in the sky, and the views are breathtaking. The bathrooms, as other have noted, look a bit worse for the wear, but have a separate soaking tub and shower, which seems to be where the 5 stars try to break from the 4 star chain hotels. The baths, while spotless, apparently were not renovated with the rest of the rooms ... they have that &quot;glamorous&quot; 1980s look -- chunky beige and pink marble with gold fixtures. I suspect the baths have had little change since the hotel opened in 1987.The service, as one anticipates, was very, very good -- from the welcome tea service to the friendly and informative desk and door people. All in all, this is a 5 star hotel, but one that disappoints slightly. If you want a nice room with a great view, don't hesitate to book here. If you want the whole 5 star package, look at other hotels."
105,2116,"Feb 10 2007 	Great service	We stayed at the Mandarin for a special occassion and found the service to be absolutely top notch. The restaurant was wonderful (we planned a special dinner), the corner suite was spectacular, and the concierge was beyond helpful. My whole party-6 rooms-were all very impressed by the level of service that the Mandarin gave. We would stay there again without hesitation."
106,2116,"Feb 6 2007 	Not up to the standard of Mandarin New York	The arrival experience at the Mandarin SF is disappointing. The lobby and lobby lounge area are quite small, pokey and tired. Very similar oriental decor to the old Mandarin Hong Kong but without the scale of the space. The reception staff were, however, extremely welcoming and informative. The staff and service were generally one of the high points of the stay. The public areas really are a huge disappointment. The carpet designs are particularly jarring - lacking any finesse or subtlety. A pity that the design of the refurbishment did not emulate the contemporary design of the new Landmark Mandarin or The Mandarin New York.The good points about this hotel include the views and the room size. We had a corner suite facing away from the harbour. I'm sure the suites that face onto the harbour are quite amazing. Having windows on two sides of the room really gave the suite a feeling of spaciousness and lightness. The decor looks dated even though this room was recently refurbished. The bathroom is a disappointment - reasonable in scale but again shabby. On turning on the water the shower head fell off the wall causing water to flood into the room. This required us to change to another room and the staff were prompt and courteous in finding another room. One interesting and welcome feature was the ability to open the window to obtain fresh air - yes and on level 44 of the tower ! Scary. The room service was amongst the best we had ever had and reminded me of the superlative cuisine of the Mandarin Hong Kong (not the Mandarin Landmark). We had breakfast in the restaurant, Silks, on the lower level of the tower. Such a shame that it doesn't have the amazing views of the rooms.All these criticisms apart we did enjoy our stay and found the location quite central and convenient. We have found the Mandarin Oriental hotels to be of quite varying standards. The Mandarin New York is by far the best we have stayed at. The Landmark Mandarin Hong Kong has a superlative contemporary room design. The Mandarin London is one hotel I'd rather forget ! The Mandarin San Francisco is really a little ho-hum."
107,2116,"Jan 25 2007 	Not a FAN	As another reviewer commented, this hotel has no soul. It is stale. The lobby area (including what is alleged to be a bar) is lame, lame, lame. Except for the congenial service from staff and the great views from the upper level rooms, there is no reason to stay at this hotel.To be fair, I received excellent service from every employee. I was impressed. But, excellent service does not overcome a physical plant that requires major updating, from the public areas, to the small and inadequate workout room, to the bathrooms in the guest rooms. My room was nicely appointed and enjoyed a great view, but the bathroom was tired and dingy.For $450/night, this is not a good value. I will never stay here again."
108,2116,"Jan 14 2007 	great view but soulless	Recommended to stay at the Mandarin for our first time in San Francisco. I was looking forward to the experience as I have been to the Mandarin in Hong Kong many times.Arrived 8.30 pm Saturday. Hotel in the middle of the business district....just office blocks.Good welcome but noone else around in the lobby. Asked to know what time the restaurant was open till and told no restaurant at the weekends !!!!! I mean this is the Mandarin in San Francisco and no restaurant !Told that we could have a snack at the bar up to 9pm or have room service.The barman told us that the hotel only comes to life in the weekdays.Room was great...big bed, great views.Decided to quit San Francisco after 1 day and go to L.AWould have stayed longer but the hotel was just so lacking in atmosphere. Breakfast was good, but the room was dark and uninviting.Great hotel if you are doing business downtown, but if you are a traveller on vacation chose somewhere else.The staff were excellent, concierge was terrific but the hotel lacked any soul."
109,2116,Jan 4 2007 	A great hotel with amazing views	An excellent hotel. We stayed on the 42nd floor with fantastic views of the bay. There was of course no traffic noise. The service was of a very high standard.The lobby was rather cold and lacking in atmosphere but that would not stop us staying at the hotel again.
110,2116,"Jan 4 2007 	Very standard	I'm used to stay at the European boutique hotels so I find that this one is as charming as a boiled potatoe. Yes, the views are great and the rooms huge but the furnishing was absolutely vulgar. It has no atmosphere, the guests are threated like numbers in the computer of the front desk!I'm not saying that this is a bad hotel, it is quite good actually, but don't expect to find the best hotel in the USA, simpli it is not"
111,2116,"Oct 30 2006 	EXCELLENT Hotel!!	We had a Wonderful stay at this hotel. The staff was amazing. Very helpful and kind. This is the Best service we've had!!! Also the room was great- very clean, great view!!Highly Recommended!!!"
112,2116,Oct 28 2006 	Perfect stay in San Francisco	Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental October 17-21. My wife and I were taking encaustic art classes in the Bayview district and wanted a base to hit restaurants after classes. Decided to try the Mandarin to see if the reputation is warranted. We have been to San Francisco several times at the usual highly rated hotels. The Mandarin was such a delightful experience. We can't stop praising the attentive yet unobtrusive staff at this smaller hotel. We had a corner room on the 41st floor that overlooked the Golden Gate Bridge and you felt like you could touch the pyramid as you looked out past the tower onto Alcatraz. Our last night we experienced the famous fog as it rolled in and gently engulfed the city. We didn't want to leave the room. Used room service one afternoon to catch the Cardinals in the Series and they did a spectacular job. A slight wine error was promptly and graciously repaired to our benefit. The rooms are recently renovated and are lovely. Having the city as your nightlight is priceless. We shall gladly return.
113,2116,"Oct 15 2006 	One of the best hotels is the US	I have stayed in this hotel since it opened almost 20 years ago. First (and best) are the views since the hotel starts on the 39th floor. Either the Bay Bridge or GoldenGate Bridge (and sometimes both) are visible from almost every room. Both in the morning and at night the views are the best of any hotel in the US (even better than NYC). The rooms have been redone and now have plasma TVs. The staff is very helpful and the welcoming tea after clearing the SFO airport hassle is always nice. The hotel restaurant Silks is excellent and within a 5-10 minute walk are many of the best restaurants in SF. The restaurants in the Ferry Building nearby offer great food and a spectacular view. Lastly, the hotel is convenient to most meetings and to jogs or walks along the Embarcadero. My favorite city hotel in the US!!!"
114,2116,"Sep 29 2006 	Fantastic !!!	This has got to be one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in. The rooms are beautiful, the staff bend over backwards to help, the dining is divine. Nothing short of 5 stars all round. Why waste your time staying anywhere else."
115,2116,"Sep 25 2006 	First Class	We stayed at the Mandarin for the last two days of our wine country vacation before flying back to the east coast. The hotel staff was very eager and helpful. The room was fantastic, complete with Plasma TV and the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel. Room was beautiful and so was the view. A memorable ending to a wonderful getaway."
116,2116,"Sep 3 2006 	Great view but not on par with the competition	We recently spent the weekend at the SF Mandarin Oriental. While the view and room were very nice the room service, food, and overall experience was not on par with other 5 star locations like the Ritz Carlton or St. Regis. If there were a rating for room service food I would have to give it a 1 star. I've had better food at low end hotels. The front desk staff was cordial but cold. We actually had to dig at them to get details on the package we purchased for our stay. If all you're looking for is view and quiet, this is your place. If however you want the total 5 star experience you're better off going to the Ritz Carlton in SF or Half Moon Bay."
117,2116,"Sep 2 2006 	Great Views Great Hotel	I had the pleasure of staying here for a few days and must say that this is one of the better hotels in the country. I was in room 3905 which had a great view of the golden gate bridge in the background. Staff can't do enough for you, they always call you by name. Didn't eat in the hotel restaurant Silks, but everything else in the hotel is top notch. They had a good rate of $395 a night for a room which normally sells for $610 a night."
118,2116,"Aug 1 2006 	More than just a great view!	The Mandarin Oriental is a lovely, class act in the heart of San Francisco's financial district, where most other hotels are thoroughly dull. Since the hotel occupies the top floors of one of the tallest skyscrapers in town, a principal selling point is the stunning view [it is a bit bizarre to find oneself looking DOWN at the facade of Grace Cathedral atop nearby Nob Hill]. One advantage to the elevation is blessed silence, not a virtue to be taken lightly in San Francisco: at the Mandarin Oriental, you don't need to worry about cable cars rumbling past your window, or garbage trucks groaning up San Francisco's steep hills.We stayed in a Mandarin King. These are spacious, comfortable and beautifully decorated; with plenty of room for the roll-away for our daughter. The bathrooms are enormous, with tubs next to the windows, so you bathe with a view. Service is impeccable. A butler delivered soft drinks for my wife and me, and milk and cookies for our daughter, minutes after we checked in, and gratis. When I asked for directions to Restaurant Gary Danko, near Ghirardelli Square, the concierge arranged for transportation in the hotel's complimentary chauffered car. Breakfast, which came with the &quot;seasonal choices&quot; package, was served in the restaurant downstairs (we could also have arranged room service), and was excellent.We are relatively old fashioned, and usually opt for smaller, boutique hotels in San Francisco. But for our detour into highrise modernity, the Mandarin Oriental was most impressive. The MO is a superb hotel in every respect."
119,2116,"Jul 14 2006	Sky High	My wife, 4 month old, and I just stayed at the Mandarin with the romance package for 2 nights. It was an excellent stay all around - we were on the 48th floor with views from the Golden Gate all the way past the Bay Bridge. Crib was provided with great amenities for new parents and it received its own turn-down service. The bathrooms windows over the tub made for great baths and overall the stay was just fantastic. Silks, the hotel restaurant, was very understanding in providing room service due to baby issues, and the staff were prompt, courteous, and always friendly. Highly recommended, this is our 2nd favorite hotel in the world (Peninsula Bangkok still rules)."
120,2116,"Jul 13 2006	The Best!	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for 2 nights in July.We were upgraded to a Bay View Room that was fabulous! Asian decor - with amazing views. Upon entering the hotel all the staff were fabulous! Bell hop, valet, front desk, and concierge. Very pleasant, attentive and helpful in every way. We were made to feel so special with the staff always greeting us.We didn't want to leave!Great comfortable bed in the room- with top of the line amenities in the bathrooms.We loved the location- were able to walk to many of the best restaurants- Boulevard, Slanted Door etc.We ate breakfast in the restaurant every morning- and it was great!If you are looking for a 5 star hotel in San Francisco, with wonderful service and great accomodations - then this is the only place to stay."
121,2116,"Jul 4 2006	Do great views make a great hotel?	We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for the first two nights of a summer holiday. This was our first stay at a Mandarin Oriental, and we had high hopes for the rooms, the service and the overall ambiance. The newly remodeled rooms are beautiful: the modern Asian feel of the furnishings combined with big picture windows with million dollar views made the cost of the room feel more worthwhile. The service was fine, but it didnt have the warmth and thoroughness we expect from a five star property. Perhaps because of its location in the financial district, this hotel seems like more of a business hotel than a vacation home away from home. The public spaces arent really connected and this disjointed feeling doesnt lend itself to spending time in the building. We also found it odd that the bar was never open in the evenings of our stay, despite the fact that we were at the hotel over a weekend when one might assume it would be open later. We were upgraded from our Deluxe City View Room to a Bay View Room with incredible views of the Golden Gate Bridge, North Beach, China Town and the Embarcadero. Although the smaller room was nice (we saw it before being upgraded to a room with the king bed we had reserved), the Bay View Room had more space and a much better view. We definitely appreciated the difference. Breakfast in the restaurant was wonderful and a definite highlight of our stay. We enjoyed our visit, but this is not a hotel wed seek out again. Despite the nice rooms and wonderful views, the overall experience is more functional than fabulous. Its very good, but not great."
122,2116,"Jun 19 2006	spectacular views	My husband, baby and I stayed at the Mandarin and cannot say enough about it. We had the bridge to bridge view which was breath taking. You have the TransAmerica building directly in front of you, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, Bay Bridge, and Golden Gate view. They have binoculars in the room too. We had clear days and could see everything and at night the city was beautiful. The rooms are very large with a small sitting area, bathrooms are large with seperate marble tub and shower. They provided a lovely crib for our son and even put infant amenities in it, baby lotion, wipes, diaper, baby bath, ducky and small stuffed toy! They have a lovely jasmine tea service in your room when you arrive and also had a sweets/chocolates tray also. Valet/doorman were very welcoming and provided good suggestions for dinner etc. Complimentary bottled water in the room and fitness center is also a nice touch. They also had a notice that they are getting high def TV and satelite by July. Location was good, could walk to Embarcadero, ferry terminal markets, union square. Sundays are challenging though since many restaurants are closed in immediate area, but they have a free car service that will take you to dinner. Loved the Mandarin!"
123,2116,"Jun 11 2006	Besides the view...Nothing special at all	The view is good, otherwise there is absolutely nothing special about this hotel. I don't mind spending $500 a night for good service, great surroundings and extra amenities. The lobby is drab, the rooms are ok and there is nothing up and above the Holiday Inn. The only special feature about our room was a volume control in the bathroom for the TV. If I spent $150 on this room, I would have considered it a decent value. Aspirin at the front desk will cost you and a glass of juice with a danish will run you $20. Again the view was good, but not great. If you want a great view, be prepared to plunk down another $200.There were no problems, we just left blah and ripped off."
124,2116,"May 29 2006 	Spectacular views	Superb service, spectacular views. If you care about service or views from the rooms, this is the perfect hotel in SF. 100.0% satisfied with every touch of service. We were upgraded to a king suite, on the top floor, and while expensive, was worth every penny as far as I am concerned. The room was really beautiful, with a spectactular view of the golden gate bridge, and the rest of the city. No pool, so don't bring the kids, but prompt and courteous service throughout, and plenty of amenities in the room. Bathrobes, slippers, free bottled water, and nice music was on when we returned to the room. Room service was prompt (a rarity I find these days), and valet parking always had my car ready. I'll stay here again on my next trip to SF."
125,2116,"May 24 2006	Absolute Best Service	My husband, 9 year old daughter and I just returned from 4 nights at the Mandarin Oriental. I can't say enough about the service we received. Here are the highlights:* complimentary wine and tea in our room for us just after arrival* complimentary cheese, crackers and fruit waiting for us one evening after a long day sightseeing* concierge had a rental car ready and waiting for us within 30 minutes of our request* all staff called us by name every time they saw us* doormen learned what type of restaurants we liked and sent us to them in the house carThere are lots of great things about this hotel: the view, quality of the rooms, the location but the people there make it a truly special place to stay. It beats the Trump, the Plaza or the Ritz hands down."
126,2116,"May 16 2006	Favorite Hotel Anywhere	This hotel is pricey, but, after several stays here during the past couple of years, this is my favorite hotel anywhere. If you have business in downtown S.F., and want to get in or out quickly to the airport, the location is perfect. The rooms are outstanding: comfortable beds, precise and subtle climate controls, magnificent views. The fitness center is good. The lobby staff is excellent. The atmosphere is one of quiet and privacy. The only downside is the food, which is merely edible. However, there is an outstanding steak house around the corner in the Omni, and numerous other good restaurants not far away."
127,2116,"Apr 27 2006	Charming	Had the pleasure of staying here last May. Started our California trip in San Francisco for 3 days followed by a drive down the entire coast. Also proposed to my wife in San Francisco on same trip. The hotel is lovely and rooms are of the highest quality. Beautiful rooms with only the nicest linens. Bathroom was also very nice and unique, the way a luxury hotel should be. The doormen went above and beyond for any of our needs and I give them credit for learning my name and remembering to call me by name every time I entered or exited. Something I don't ask for but certainly is nice to hear. The one concierge (male) was very nice and helpful, recommending and even making reservations at different restaurants that are unique to San Francisco. Although I did think that the female concierge could of been a bit more attentive when my wife's heel strap broke on our way out one night. There was no recommendation of shoe repair, though it was late and I doubt one would of been open. The best she came up with was pointing us to the mall down the street. Just nitpicking, but she didn't go above and beyond by any means.Overall a great hotel and upon departure my Hertz rental car was brought to the front door and bags placed in them by the wonderful doormen."
128,2116,"Mar 8 2006	Excellent	Knew of the views of this hotel and the glass walled hallways that face north and south between the two hotel &quot;towers&quot; on the upper floors of a multi-use building. Had even snuck up here to check out the view prior to staying. The price is high, but to me worth it for special occasions or if it is already in the budget.The service and accommodation are top notch - any request will be accommodated with efficiency and a smile.The views are unbelievable - stayed in a bridge to bridge suite (corner facing NW, North, NE on east tower). Did not eat in hotel except for room service breakfast - it was good - nothing over the top.Excellent 4 fixture bath, stereo with cd, didn't watch TV.Penthouse floor under renovation, stayed on non renovated floor - it was fine - hotel preferred to place us in renovated floor but we declined for higher floor.Don't miss the fresh Mandarin Oranges by the elevator at lobby floor.I would stay here again - it is all about the views."
129,2116,"Feb 23 2006	The very best!	My husband and I used to call this &quot;our&quot; hotel because we loved it very much. We have tried to stay here at least half of the times whenever we came to The City when we still lived in the States. We even had our wedding here.The staff at Mandarin Oriental treated their guests as if they were very important people. Our wedding's ceremony and reception were held in Mandarin Oriental's Library Room. We stayed at the hotel but our guests and family members stayed in a different place downtown. Afterward, our children wanted to go back to their hotel so they asked the desk staff to order them a cab. &quot;No, you don't need a cab; our limo will take you anywhere you want to go.&quot; The desk staff replied.At the time, our children were not very polished if you judged them from their appearance. They were the typical college students who lived in (and sometimes even slept in) their jeans, T-shirts, and track shoes. They were intelligent, polite, and articulate, but they were not preppy and definitely not the limo-rider kind. They were also not Mandarin Oriental's guests, but that fact did not matter to the staff. Everyone treated them with respect and courtesy.Every room in the hotel has panoramic view because of the floor-to-ceiling windows and because this all-glass hotel is the third highest building in The City. There are different views available with different room series. In every room, there is Frette linen, thick and soft bathrobes, his and her slippers, and high quality bath products. Evening service includes fresh fruit plate brought to room. Limo service is gratuity to guests (and in our case, family members of guests). Understated luxury and old world elegance are what you will find here. Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco writes the book about quality and service. I wish everyone else would read their book and follow their example.Note: Fridays and Saturdays rate is lower than during the week."
130,2116,"Feb 13 2006 	Superb apart from the food	Wonderful 5 star, central hotel to stay in San Francisco. Very friendly and helpful staff especialy the lovely receptionist who couldn't do enough to make my stay perfect. Views that take your breath away - romantic sunsets across the pacific ocean. Beautiful rooms that are manicured to perfection every day.The only downside was the room service food which was by far the poorest I have ever tasted. Salty, overcooked and lukewarm. I had the steak one night and then chicken linguine. The clam chowder was top quality however :) ps - I had a few friends staying at the OMNI round the corner where the steak was the best they'd ever had."
131,2116,"Jan 22 2006	couldn't wait to leave this hotel	although the views from our room were drop dead gorgeous, we were completely bored at the Mandarin Oriental and felt isolated in a sterile cube. the room furnishings lacked the austere beauty I'd been hoping for - the room's furnishings were quite plain and unremarkable. we were in a bridge to bridge view room - expensive - but we didn't feel pampered or special while staying at the hotel in any way. room service food was quite plain; good quality ingredients but not particularly delicious or gourmet. we actually felt a bit depressed in this hotel, we couldn't wait to leave - so we checked out a day early."
132,2116,"Jan 14 2006	lovely spot from which to see the city	We splashed out on the Mandarin for the last two nights of our vacation, in part based on the reviews on this site. The view made the room worthwhile (although we were &quot;only&quot; on the 39th floor, and discovered that taking the elevator up to the top floor yields some spectacular views from the corridor). But we were assuming (in retrospect, for no particular reason) that the room would be larger, and that there would be a more appealing hotel bar to enhance our Mandarin experience. The service was impeccable - the concierge was more than happy to research and answer my random questions. This is an expensive hotel - if on company expenses, it would be a no brainer to stay here. But if you're on your own dime, it's definitely a serious splurge, so don't spend it if you're going to think about it too much."
133,2116,"Oct 23 2005	The best hotel in the USA	My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Mandarin Oriental, San Francisco during August this year (2005). We selected the hotel largely based on the review of this site and we were not disappointed.We had arranged for a town car to collect us from the airport through Virgin and this more than likely put us in a great mood as it was an excellent welcome to a fantastic city. The doorman was waiting to great us by name (we still haven't figured out how they knew who we were) and instantly made us feel like royalty. The check-in staff were so friendly, again using my name and making me feel valued as a customer (some will say at $500+ a night they should but you certainly get more than you pay for) and we were upgraded from the Bay to Bay view room we had booked to a suite with sunken bath in the window and much greater floor space. We were introduced to one of the concierge team who made reservations for us at a local restaurant after which we were escorted to our room.I believe that first impressions (certainly when it comes to hotels) count a lot and our first impression of the room was excellent. The room was light and airy and the views were breathtaking - on the days when the famous San Francisco fog took a break you could see for miles - our room had views of the Bay Bridge as well as the Transamerica Pyramid - we couldn't see the Golden Gate Bridge but this was shrouded in fog for the majority of our stay so no great loss (you will see it constantly when you are out and about on the multitude of tours available). The room was incredibly clean and tidy, a complimentary set of binoculars enhance the view and the tv is a decent size and hidden away in a cabinet - it could do with updating as many similar priced hotels have larger and flatter screens but we didn't come to watch tv!). The bed was incredibly comfortable, with more cushions and pillows than a soft furnishing store which all added to the sense of opulance and luxury. Also in the room were a selection of comfy chairs which were really handy after long walks taking in the sights. One of my favourite aspects of the suite was the bathroom - it was massive, luxurious and had one of the best hotel showers I have come across. The walk in shower had enough room for about six people (I haven't actually tested this statement!) and the power was excellent especially given the fact that we were on the 38th floor. Two Mandarin embroidered robes were provided - they were a little on the small side - as well as slippers. The toileteries were E'sporta which my wife advise me are very good, combined with some fab bath salts and a Bonsai tree next to the bath. Again the views from the bathroom and the sunken bath were breathtaking especially at night.We had a turn-down service every evening, the robes were laid out on the bed, water provided, relaxing music played and bedside mats and slippers placed at the side of the bed.The hotel gym is fine for a quick workout with plenty of cardio machines, free weights and fixed weight equipment. I was the only person using the gym for much of my stay - a bonus of visiting the gym are the complimentary bottles of water and fruit.Transfer time (by town car) from the airport is around 25-30 minutes. The hotel is located perfectly - the California cable car line is only a short walk from the hotel, with Union Square around a 10 minute walk. Also nearby is Chinatown - an excellent experience with some superb restaurants. We never ate at the hotel as we were more often out but I can recommend the local Deli's for breakfast.The Mandarin Oriental San Francisco is not the cheapest hotel by any means but if you want a really special experience where you are made to feel like a king and queen then this is the hotel for you. San Fran is a fantastic city and if I ever get the opportunity to go back I will make sure I am staying at the Mandarin."
134,2116,"Oct 5 2005	Great views	Had a Bridge to Bridge room, with amazing views (but time the windows had a clean please!). Room very comfortable, quiet and relaxing. Rest of the hotel is a &quot;miss&quot;, with no bar or restaurant you'd want to go to, and the decor is all a bit 1980s-style tacky and looking tired, but all is forgiven for the room and the views. Expensive though, especially outside of Fri/Sat nights, as this is a business hotel. Cost us $550+tax on a Sunday night, which was too much considering lack of a cool bar etc."
135,2116,"Sep 6 2005	Very classy great view!	Views are without a doubt one of the main attractions of this hotel. From room and corridors there is little of San Francisco that you can't see.Rooms are contemporary with an oriental flavour. Service discreet, attentive and polite. Turn down service excellent. Maid picked up of fault we were not aware of and speedily had it rectified by maintenance.Meal at Silk's one of the finest we experienced on our trip. Nice to try something out of the ordinary. Restaurent staff very knowledgeable and added to enjoyment.Only gripe is that two elevators did not seem to service the requirements of this hotel adequately.Certainly our hotel of choice in San Francisco."
136,2116,Aug 25 2005	water infiltration in the bed!	unconfortable dirty plece to fly!
137,2116,"Aug 18 2005	Great Service - Awesome Rooms and Spectacular views!!!	I am not sure why would anyone bash this hotel.I've stayed at several Ritz Carlton's, Four Seasons, and other luxurious resorts. This hotel is top notch and probably is the best in SF.The service is absolutely amazing, anything you need, anytime.The Concierge is superb, I asked for a good sushi bar and he directed me to one of the best Sushi I have ever had. To boot the hotel sent us an appetizer on them. Having the hotel car available to take you to a play, restaurants in the ares is very convenient. The hotel views are one of the best (if not the best) of San Francisco. The Rooms are clean and ultra luxurious, the usual Mandarim Oriental high standards and touches. Beds are extremely confortable and the linens are 300 Thread count or better. All Marble bathrooms with every amenity in the book.It is going to be tough to go back to the Ritz (my favorite chain) in SF after I've stayed in the Mandarim.If you like to be pampered and enjoy the best, look no futher.Get a room with a view, you won't be disappointed."
138,2116,Aug 12 2005 	What a disappointment	For $340 plus tax the room was pokey and a weird shape. The bathroom had peeling wall paper and chipped paint. Breakfast for two cost almost $50. There was only one waitress serving the whole cocktail lounge in the evening who was literally running from table to table. This in &quot;the best hotel in San Francisco?&quot; - I don't think so!
139,2116,"Aug 11 2005	The Fog can block your view!	Great hotel but don't bank on a good view all the time. We were in S.F. in August (Fog Season) and could not see the street from 38 floors up... not to mention ever seeing the bay. If you have an expectation of having a great view just cause you are on floor 38-48... just be ware.Otherwise, there are reasons this is regarded as one of the best in the world! Good look"
140,2116,"Jul 19 2005	Top Notch!	The Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco is by far the absolute nicest hotel I have ever stayed. This is the second time I stayed there. The view was breathtaking and part of the reason we went back. I didn't think the view from the first time we stayed could be topped and yet it was!! The staff was absolutely lovely. It is definetely an upper crust hotel but I in my jean shorts, teeshirt and flip flops was never treated any different than the ladies and gentlemen in their formal wear. The staff is impeccable! I must admit I never ate at Silks (the hotel restaurant) but was assured by other guests that it was an unforgetable culinary experience."
141,2116,"Jul 10 2005	Beautiful Hotel But Very Expensive for a Sightseeing Trip	My husband and I spent 2 days and 1 night in San Francisco (which is not nearly enough time to spend there) this June. The hotel is elegant and well maintained. The service was excellent (we are loyal Ritz Carlton guests when we travel) and we found the Mandarin staff to be very professional, well-trained, friendly, helpful, and unpretentious. We had a bridge-to-bridge room and the view in the hallway and in the room was spectacular. There were binoculars in the room, and what an awesome sight it was! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because as tourists, we spent very little time enjoying the hotel, yet payed almost $400 for the 1 night. We surely did not get our money's worth. I knew the hotel would be great, but had I realized that, other than sleeping, I would spend barely 2 hours in the room, I would have opted for a cheaper hotel, or at least a cheaper room. I would recommend a stay here if you will be able to enjoy the hotel and your room, not if you will be doing major sightseeing."
142,2116,"Jun 23 2005	superlative service and room!	THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Also, huge tub in the bathroom and separate power shower, Frette bathrobes. Jasmin tea and cookies delivered to room upon arrival, chocolate strawberries and biscuits for our honeymoon. Lovely view of bridge. Very knowledgeable concierge.We did feel slightly untidy though walking through the lobby on Saturday evening, returning after a day's sightseeing as the ambiance is quite formal! Perhaps not the best location for sightseeing but handy for Chinatown and we like to walk anyway.We loved it here though and were given booklets about Carmel as we checked-out when we mentioned that we were driving down the coast. A nice touch!SF is a great city. All the tourist attractions are really worthwhile doing and the city has an energy simialr to NYC but not quite so frantic! Loved it!"
143,2116,"May 29 2005 	Superb in all respects	Truly excellent service from every employee encountered. Room service was stellar in both selection and quality. Views are unbeatable, and the rooms are reasonably large and very nicely furnished. The complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby before the restaurant opens is very nice, as is the complementary internet access in the business center. I love the Ritz and the Four Seasons, but I will continue to choose the MO for the views..."
144,2116,Apr 25 2005	Rock Solid	Fantastic service and unbelievable views made our stay at the Mandarin an absolute pleasure. Best in San Francisco.
145,2116,"Apr 13 2005 	Exxxxxcellence At The Mandarin San Francisco	I read about this hotel on Trip Advisor and decided to try it out. We were visiting SF on business and vacation ( for one week) with a 22 month old baby. Those times when we had to stay in the hotel because of the baby we did not mind, the view was excellent, the food from room service was divine. The staff was attentive and the concierge service was extremely helpful. We did not get to take advantage of the car service since it was unavailable on the two ocassions we requested it. The hotel was clean, even under the bed, where kids' toys tend to rest. The bathroom was spotless. The turndown service in the evenings was a treat. The pictures online are real and my room did look like one of those online. This hotel is quintessential feng shui glamour, understated, but very polished and it quietly exuded a monied atmosphere. There were even some top R&amp;B stars and politicians who were also guests in the hotel. I am hard to please and I was quite satisfied."
146,2116,"Apr 2 2005	Excellent Hotel	Hotel is close to China town and Union Square, a little further walk to Fisherman's wharf. Cable car stop just outside. Room was amazing. Beautiful views of the city. Bathroom was luxurious. Service was outstanding. The slightest request brought swift and curtious responses. Only thing was the dining room was closed when we arrived at 6pm for some reason, and valet parking added $50 a day to an already expensive bill."
147,2116,"Mar 15 2005	Great room common areas need aesthetic updating...	My boyfriend and I spent a weekend in San Fran. We booked a room through the Mandarin's special packages...Golden Gate Bridge room (highest upgrade before you hit the suite rate,) free American daily breakfast, late 6pm checkout. The room was on the 46th floor, quiet, huge, nice hallway, incredible bathroom. Furnishings were interesting, a mix of Japanese with high tech. Turns out room number 4604 was an experimental model for the upcoming renovations. Mgmt chose not to go with that design, but for us it was rather perfect. We had a corner room, the views were stunning. The bed and bedding were superb. Sitting areas were very good, the bathtub was right next to a huge panoramic window. The tub itself could have been bigger, it was definitely too small for 2 (but we squeezed in anyway.) Amenities were by Escada, nice touch, perhaps a little too chemical for me (I prefer L'Occitane.) Tea service upon arrival. The common areas, however, look like they've been frozen in the 1980s. All that polished gold with green walls, weird carpeting, it's soooo dated. But who cares, we went to Fleur de Lys (fabulous) and Slanted Door for dinner. Btw, Slanted is overrated. Oh, and the gym at the hotel is EXCELLENT, but bring your own gear, because they don't have gym clothes for sale or rent. I worked out in my robe and slippers. Didn't get any stares because the gym was basically empty. Will we be back? Yes, at $459/night for that fabulous room with breakfast and late checkout, you bet!"
148,2116,"Mar 4 2005	Views and service!	We stayed at this hotel on Feb. 19, during the Chinese New Year Parade (didn't know it was happening) The city was crowded and festive. When we arrived we were upgraded to a corner view room on the 46th floor. Wow, the view. Views haven't been a big deal to us in the city. We love the Campton Place Hotel and there is no view. However, this view was so dramatic! We were offered the town car service to avoid all the parking hassles during the parade and shortly after checkin jasmine tea and cookies were delivered to the room in an adorable closed basket. None of the services above were asked for. Great service. I understand that the rooms could be udated but they are very clean, have nice amenities and views to die for!"
149,2116,"Mar 2 2005	NOT the Four Seasons!!!	Just stayed for four nights and five full days while at a conference in SF. As others have noted, there isn't a better view in town - lying in my bed (I was in a Bridge to Bridge Room) I could see just about every notable attraction in town - the bridges, Coit Tower, Alcatraz, etc., etc. etc. However, this is where the greatness in this hotel ends.Though I usually stay at the Four Seasons when I vacation, I decided that I ought to give the Mandarin a shot - hey, AAA Five Diamond, Mobile 5 Star - it can't be that bad.......let's find out:A stain on the bed sheet; pink gum on the top left door of the bathroom stall; foot prints on the carpet; mug stains on the marble around the sink and on a coffee table; a turn down service that was so insistent on getting the job done that they returned twice within an hour (the last time forcing themselves into the room as I dressed for the evening); a lobby and lounge staff about as personable as a paper weight; a doorman that was on his cell phone more often than he opened the door; and a concierge staff that said they would call me to follow up on an inquiry and forgot one too many times.These unmentionables were during the first two days - at which point I started complaining to my wife - telling her that we had made a mistake in the hotel we had chosen and that this hotel didn't hold a candle to the Four Seasons.I'm not one to publicly complain, but this deserved it, and my wife, without me knowing it, went down to the lobby, pulled a manager into the lounge, and in a very nice manner, without any of the aforementioned detail, summed it up for the manager by saying that the place sucked! The manager proceeded to offer my wife breakfast, a discount, etc. My wife refused everything, which she said surprised the manager. But, we weren't looking for handouts - we were looking for the level of service and attention to detail that we had expected when booking a hotel company that claims that it can and does deliver (and which I and many of you had read about and which I personally had heard about from some of my wife's colleagues who have stayed at their hotels in Asia). Well, over the next two days the level of service did a 180 - not just for us, but noticibly for everyone else as well! For us, the hotel town car, which hadn't been offered before - was now at our becking call; our names were used regularly upon entrance into and from the hotel; the front door was sprinted to as anyone approached; and we got reservations, on fairly short notice, to two of the city's hottest restaurants - Slanted Door and Betelnut.In summary, I guess I left wondering why this hadn't been the case from the moment we got there. If it had been, I wouldn't have written a few of the above paragraphs. This can be a phenomenal hotel with a few modern updates to the rooms, the fitness and business centers (sorry, fitness and business closets), and complete consistency in service. Maybe I was there on a bad week, but hopefully, we did everyone staying there from now on a favor - I doubt it though - excellence isn't sporadic and I am pondering on whether I should give them another fat chunk of my wallet at another one of their hotels/resorts. Can't beat it if you want a view, but don't pay these prices for a view - go to the Top of the Mark for a cocktail and stay at the Four Seasons where your wallet gets you treated like the well-paying customer you are. Good luck!!!"
150,2116,"Feb 25 2005	Classy	This hotel is beautiful. But I have to agree with one of hte reviews that the bathrooms are outdated as well as the elevator. Other than that, The views are hand down the best in San Francisco. The building itself is stunning and is the third tallest in the city. The price is to high for this hotel but if money is not a problem than i would say this hotel is well worth it. I stayed in the Golden Gate Signature room with the window in the bathroom and it was incredible at night soaking in the tub with a view of coit tower and the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. Overall, This is a wonderful hotel."
151,2116,"Feb 3 2005	Great Hotel with excellent service	Stayed at the Mandarin at the end of January 06. Very impressed with the service received from the staff, particularly concierge. They were so helpful and even sent the house car to come and get us one night from a restaurant as we had no energy left from walking up those hills! The hotel is clean and well kept. We had a Deluxe King Room with fantastic views of the city, bay area including Alcatraz and GG bridge. The bed was so comfy! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in a safe, handy, flat location for exploring all SF has to offer. Would definitely go back as staying at another hotel would simply be out of the question! Enjoy! :0)"
152,2116,"Jan 3 2005	Liked it a lot....excellent service 	The views are indeed spectacular within the rooms and I really liked my stay here, especially the location (right in the middel of downtown, easy walking distance to Nob Hill, Coit Tower, North Beach restaurants &amp; bars). The hotel is on the upper floors of the building (I was on 43rd floor) and my room seemed very large for a non-suite (actually had a hallway); my friend's room wasn't quite as large but still roomy and big compared to most hotels I've stayed in. And although I'm not a very demanding traveler and don't need all the perks associated with some of the more decadent/full-service oriented types, the few times I needed help the excellent service came through. A fax I was expecting was ready for me within 5 minutes, and evey time I asked the concierge to check on my flight or make restaurant reservations it was done immediately. Allin all, the service was very polite and timely. The bathrooms in the room were large and contained everything you could possibly need - including a bath and separate shower. The bed was extremely comfortable - as was waking up to an almost 180 degree view of SF et environs every morning!! (I will have to bring my girlfriend here sometime).On the negative side, a few minor things. First, there are only 2 elevators which made for a couple minutes of waiting from time to time (usually not a problem). Also, the gym is very small and on the 4th floor with no windows which isn't ideal and not what I'm used to at other MO's (DC and NYC) which have much larger gyms with views and a pool (DC at least) - no pool here (unlike the Ritz and Four Seasons). And the hotel lobby is nice but pretty understated and small so don't expect a grand entrance - the location and views are what you pay for here. I will come back to this hotel, but as I'm a big exerciser I think that the Ritz and Four Season are also great choices if you want a larger gym and pool. (Have stayed at the Ritz but not the Four Seasons - Ritz is up near the top of Nob hill close to the Fairmont, Intercontinental, etc.)"
153,2116,"Dec 29 2004	Very Impressive	My family and I spent the three days before Christmas '04, in a suite at the Mandarin. While some of the hotel is showing a bit of age (carpeting in the elevator, for instance), it did not detract one bit from the fantastic views and excellent service.Our rooms were very clean and spacious, with tasteful furnishings and fresh flowers. The bathrooms were huge and contained everything you could possibly need. The bed was very comfortable and I was pleased that it did not have one of those dreadful feather mattresses. Another nice feature was the zoned heat/air, i.e., the living and sleeping areas were on separate thermostats. There was also a nicely stocked mini bar, a cd player and a dvd player.The service was absolutely the best. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like the only guests in the hotel. The concierge was fantastic, suggesting restaurants (all good), making reservations and even arranging for the hotel car to drive us. Room service was fast and tasty, housekeeping was excellent and unobtrusive and our car was always ready within minutes of phoning the parking valet. The entire staff was courteous, friendly and accommodating.The views from the hotel are truly amazing and they even supply you with binoculars. We had no dirty windows in our rooms.The Mandarin Oriental was very impressive and I highly recommend it for anyone desiring an upscale hotel with outstanding service."
154,2116,"Dec 3 2004	Great View but Old and Dirty Furniture	We had the Bridge to Bridge room. The rate was almost $500 per night. The view was great, absolutely breath taking! However, the windows were dirty. Someone who stayed previously wiped it off with a hand, so we could peek through the area. Also, sofas and carpet were severly stained. The worst was the bed. Not only old, the matress were so old that the right side (near TV set) and the left side has different firmness. The right side was way soft and I felt its springs! Horrible. TV set/screen was small and cheap. Bathroom was just Okay. Water pressure was weak. The house keeping forgot to do the turn down service. I honestly think this hotel charges way higher for what they offer. We won't go back to Mandarin Oriental SF unless they update."
155,2116,"Nov 30 2004	Loved Everything!	We visited the Mandarin Oriental the first week of October. It was our first trip to San Fran and without a doubt will definitely return to both the city and the hotel. We don't even want to consider another hotel.We had a Bridge to Bridge view room (worth every penny) with outstanding views of Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge, &amp; Alcatraz. The bathroom was large with beautiful tile and really nice amenities (scale, slippers, Frette linen hand towel, nice size amenities, &amp; where else do they give you a loofah sponge with bath gel?) The service was very good and prompt; staff was friendly. The welcoming tea service was a very nice touch and the maids always offered lots of bottled water. The decor had an Asian influence which was nice for a change, and it wasn't too overboard. Can't wait to return."
156,2116,"Nov 18 2004	Great views but needs updating	I was really looking forward to staying at the Mandarin. I enjoy their properties in Hawaii and Munich, and thought -- based even on this website-- that the S.F. outpost would live up the same level of luxury. Unfortunately, although it is a fine hotel and has exemplary service, it is too outdated to merit 5 stars. First, the decor in the bedrooms, and in particular, the bathroom is old. In fact, I think my grandmother owned the circa 1980 Bulova clock that hung in the bathroom. The rugs and entrance also shows too much wear and tear, and the gym is embarrassing. The &quot;treadmills&quot; are at least 10 years old and the room itself is too small to do anything but the most basic of workouts. For the same price, I would recommend the Four Seasons, where the rooms are updated and you have access to the SportsClub LA just a few flights down from your room."
157,2116,"Oct 9 2004	loved it	What a wondeful hotel! We stayed in a &quot;Bridge to Bridge&quot; room which was as spectacular as described with panoramic views of the entire SF Bay (binoculars provided, nice touch). Absolutely stunning, worth the trip right there. The Concierge was flawless. They got us dinner reservations at an impossible to get into restaurant and also arranged for a rental car (we needed to drive down the Coast for a wedding) to be dropped off for us at the hotel. The hotel is nicely situated within walking distance of many great neighborhoods. The service is impeccable and the decor is less fussy than comparable 5 star hotels. We cannot wait to try out the M.O. New York!"
158,2116,"Oct 6 2004	excellent hotel	Really enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin. The room was excellent - extremely clean and with an amazing view overlooking the bay and bridges. The staff were very friendly, took the time to learn our names and made suggestions as to places to visit on our stay. Breakfast was included in the price and there was an extensive choice available - tried something different each morning and they were all delicious. Dinner at Silks, the hotel restaurant, is a real treat - the food is a mixture of American/Asian cuisine and is delicious.The only criticism we have of this hotel (and it's a small one) is that the window overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge needed a good clean, which spoilt the view a bit. Mind you, the room was on the 40th floor so guess we can't expect the windows cleaned every day!"
159,2116,"Sep 17 2004	Great Experience	We stayed here in July, 2004. This was a 2nd honeymoon for us and important because it was our first real vacation without our children. The attention to detail is wonderful. I had missed breakfast one morning &amp; they re-opened the kitchen for me. I was very impressed. We would stay here again! The views can't be beat too!"
160,2116,"Sep 10 2004	Great views but no morning coffee?	I recently stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend for one night. Overall the service was very good, but not superb. The Executive King room on the 41st floor had amazing views (huge windows on both sides of this corner room) of the Bay Bridge and the Financial District, especially with the clear weather. The room was Asian styled and a little conservative. The marble bathroom with deep soaking tub and glass shower were wonderful. Another interesting thing was that the t.v. from the room was piped into the bathroom via speakers. The hotel also had a town car to take us to our restaurant and picked us up as well. A nice perk.Our three complaints were that in the morning, there was no complimentary coffee in the lounge or in the lobby. When we asked, they said that there was not any. Very strange, being that this is a five star hotel. Secondly, the restaurant Silks was closed for lunch and dinner on the day we arrived. Finally, the turndown service did not have a chocoate on the pillow. Despite these little concerns, I would recommend, but the service could have been a little better."
161,2116,"Sep 7 2004	Incredible service and attention	I did not have a reservation to celebrate my 18th wedding anniversary and wife's birthday.....and it was over Labor Day 2004. After looking at suites at the Huntington Hotel, and a regular room at the Ritz and the Fairmont (because that was the only thing available), nothing at the Mark Hopkins or at the Grand Hyatt or at the St. Francis, our friends at the Ritz suggested the Mandarin Oriental on Sansome Street. Got a great suite on the 41st floor with a 270 degree view. Expensive, but totally worth it. Great staff with great personalities ready to assist you with any need. Great food, room service, etc......Will stay again and again."
162,2116,"Sep 2 2004	Left my heart in San Francisco	This hotel is amazing: checking-in is a breeze, everyone is extremely helpfull and friendly! We stayed here 8 nights from 24th August untill 1st September 2004 according to their long stay package: we had a deluxe bay view king room: amazing views, definitely worth having a room facing the bay! Ask for a West Tower room, overlooking Transamerica Pyramid, Coit Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz,... you name it! The staff is so friendly, everyone knew our name after two days... roomservice is great, housekeeping is wonderfull, location of the hotel is really good for shopping and exploring the city on foot: we went to Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz, Coit Tower, Pacific Heights,... the hotel is located nearby....the food &amp; breakfast are unbelievable... enjoy this hotel for the time you're staying there, cause it will be over before you know it! Great hotel!"
163,2116,"Aug 3 2004	Service Galour	We stayed in a bridge view room with connecting room for myself, my wife and two teenage girls in late july for 4 nights. The service at this hotel rivals the best in the world. The concierge was engaging and helpful and got us everywhere, checkin was done in our room, no lobby waiting was great, everyone remembered our name and we used the house sedans to go all over town (shopping, theater, dinner, the wharf, saulsalito, muir woods), never a charge and always a delighted thank you when a tip was offered. The views are heavenly...there is just no comparing the view when the fog rolls in or has rolled out....when it stays there is not much but it cleared for us each afternoon and the sunsets were unbelievable.It is so quiet here we thought we were the only ones on our floor until the next morning when I got up for a run and saw newspapers in front of everyone's door. The hotel was full! And we never rode an elevator with anyone else for three days!The hotel restaurant, Silks was delightful, we had a quick pre-theater thing and they were accomodating, the menu only lists a prix fixed three to five course meal but they were more than happy to have us join them and wave the prix fix and let us share apps and salads. The sashimi was fresh and bountiful, the salads crisp and elegant.Breakfast from room service each morning was fresh and hot, the bagels from noah's bagels were great. For a Starbucks or a Peet's fix there are literally seven shops within three blocks, but only one open on Sunday.The hotel is about to undergo a major renovation of the rooms and public spaces...check on status before you arrive. The baths are a bit tired and the elevators need some work but this will be the best hotel in town when completed.For now if I wanted really nice accomodations I would stay at the Park Hyatt around the corner until the work is done (the ritz is too played, the 4seasons is in a combat zone and there is no way we are dealing with nob hill every day and the clift is just too 20 something for us)...but if you want the view, peace and quiet and service, this is the place - and just wait...when the renovation is done there may be no other city hotel in the world that can compare. If you are worried about value, there are much better places for you, but if you want to go in style and can handle what that brings, ths place is great."
164,2116,"Jul 14 2004 	The best choice among the best hotels in San Fran	I spent hours selecting my hotel in San Fran. I travel quite frequently and always try to select the best of the best. I base my selection on on-line reviews of Fodor's and the like, reviewing hotel websites and anything else on-line I can find. I have increasingly found Tripadvisor to have the best information. As a seasoned very high end traveler, I try to read into those writing reviews. If the author sounds like someone who has never stayed at these types of properties, I discount the &quot;Greastest experience of my life&quot; lines. Sadly, after so many high end stays, I'm spoiled and want (expect?) no problems and everything to be perfect. I'm either on holiday and need pampering or resting from a stressful business trip. If I want tickets to anything, I expect a &quot;No problem, we'll get them&quot;. A call to the conceirge asking him/her to please call the restaurant and let them know I'm late, to hold the table and add two guests should be answered with a &quot;No problem I'll take care of it&quot; and a &quot;How was your meal?&quot; when I return. Why am a I writing this? As a plea to those with a similar desire to find the best as experienced by those who know what &quot;The best&quot; really means. Please write brief reviews here at Tripadvisor.com.Anyway, the Mandarin is a great place. It's a little odd on arrival as the lobby is small and atypical. This is due to the hotel sharing the building with others for the first forty floors (or so). Once you get into the room, you'll find everything you expect combined with a fantastic view. The beds are great, the sound system and lighting are also excellent. There are soft jazzy CDs in the sleek players bedside and couch side. The bathrooms were both roomy, clean and Four Seasons standard. I had a suite with plenty of room - I want big rooms and they were typical of Ritz, Mandarin Oriental and Four Seasons in size. The concierge was able to take care of all of my requests with no problem - if you've read this far you know how important this can be for holiday or business travel. There is a hotel car/driver available gratis after you store your car in the garage for the night - this is something new for me.Bottom line, search all you want, if you want to be certain you'll find what you are looking for, The Mandarin is an excellent choice. PLEASE, if you know the best of the best for other cities, write reviews!"
165,2116,"Jul 12 2004	Expensive but worthy	Just returned from a trip which included 5 nights at the Mandarin the last week of June. The hotel is by far the best I have ever stayed in. Our view from the 42nd floor covered both bridges, alcatraz, coit tower, etc. The concierge was extremely helpful and I loved the lack of activity in the hotel overall. Took a walk to the Ritz one night and it looked like a convention was going on there. It felt private, and for 5 days I never saw a chamber maid day or night - yet every attention was taken care of. Of course, while the hotel is the best I have seen, it is also the most expensive I have stayed in. That's the way it goes."
166,2116,"Jul 7 2004	Great Experience as the Manderan	First class all the way. After debating between a couple of the cities top hotels, I chose the Mandarin because of the great reviews from past guests raving about the wonderful service and the incredible views. Needless to say both were above my expectations and the weekend could not have been better. The concierge service planned our weekend perfectly booking us into some incredible restaurants, the bed was extremely comfortable, Tea as we arrived was refreshing, we called to get our shoes shined... done in 10 minutes. There are many places in SF, the Mandarin is a great luxury hotel with an amazing view. Have fun!"
167,2116,"Jun 29 2004	The Standard of Excellence	This establishment defines the standard of &quot;excellence&quot; in the world of luxury hotels. Service is first-class and nothing is outrageous for the concierge. I had outlandish requests, such as booking dinner for two in the city's best restaurants on the busiest nights with only hours notice and they were able to accomodate me. The view from the 45th floor was, perhaps, the greatest view offered by any hotel in the Americas. A car was made available to me when possible, which was all the time. Room service was prompt and efficient. The staff were corteous and warm. Checking in and out was a breeze. I will return, but more importantly, I have become a &quot;fan&quot; of the Mandarin Hotel experience."
168,2116,May 14 2004	The Best of the Best	This hotel is unbelivable. I am staying there on the 22nd of May but went to see the rooms and they are all top in the city from an overall standpoint. The service is very good but i would not say excellent. I The views are incredible and the the hotel has nothing but high powered excutives filling the halls so it brings a certain feeling to you as you walk around the premisis. I will have another update for you when i spend the night at the Mandarain Oriental.
169,2116,"Mar 1 2004	Nice but Expensive!	This is a beautiful hotel - no doubt - but you're going to have to shell out big bucks. Not unlike the Four Seasons or, in other cities, the Peninsula. Lots of attention to detail, but when assessing a dollar-for-dollar value, I must say a three or four star hotel will provide a better &quot;bang for your buck&quot;. Now, if money is no object, then this place is for you."

1,2120,Nov 19 2009 	Trip to SF	August while hot in most of the country can be a little chilly in SF. You need a heavy Jacket and long pants because of the fog that rolls in very thick. If you don't you'll be running to one of those kiosks that sell SF stuff and buying sweats and jackets. This happened to me while staying at the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf!
2,2120,"Oct 26 2009 	Nice hotel Great location	Marriott was very nice. It had extremely comfortable beds and was very clean. The location was fabulous. It was only 1 block away from the Cable cars, and was easy walking distance to the wharf. Only knock was there really was no place in the lobby to sit and visit with anyone. They had a lobby bar, that was OK, but was hoping for more of a hangout area in the lobby."
3,2120,Oct 20 2009 	Near great sights	I was so close to places we wanted to go. They even helped us choose places to go and places to eat. The price of the room were good priced for how close we were to big attractions.
4,2120,"Oct 10 2009 	Great Location	Great location near lots of good restaurants. Although I was only in SFO a day for 24 hours on a business trip, the hotel was 1-2 blocks from everywhere I needed to go. I was able to get a bit of sightseeing in.Rooms were great. The bed was very comfortable and I slept better than at home."
5,2120,Oct 8 2009	Fanfreakintastic	i have never slept in a more comfortable bed. i was asleep before i got the covers over me. The free breakfast was better than many breakfast buffets that i have paid for.
6,2120,"Oct 5 2009 	Good Choice for Tourism	My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is very clean. I think it was just remodeled. They were painting the outside, which was not bothersome. It is a typical Marriott, albeit a bit on the small side. Front desk was very nice except for one older, surly guy. Also, they do not have safes in the room, so leave valuables at home. otherwise, you can get a safety deposit box at the desk, but it will be a hassle. We never travel with valuables so it was not a problem for us. Marriott FW has nice fireplaces in the lobby to cozy up to with a bottle of wine. Convenient location to many attractions including, Fisherman's Wharf, Embarcadero, Ferry to Alcatraz, pier 39 for sea lions, Buena Vista for irish coffess, and more...all within walking distance. I suggest buying water at the Walgreens 2 blocks down towards the pier since, the hotel charges a lot for water and they give you an empty fridge to use. Overall, this place is a good choice, especially if you get a good rate. We paid $80/night through Priceline."
7,2120,"Sep 30 2009 	Clean and friendly hotel in great location.	This is the first time I have taken my family to San Fransisco so wanted excellent quality and price. I got both.The hotel was very clean, staff helpful and friendly. The room was exactly what I had asked for and had linen changed daily. I used the hotel computer to confirm my flight seats and printed my boarding passes all for no extra charges. When I wanted to use my own computer free of charge I used the link cable in the telephone booth and it worked with no problems. A shortcut in/out of the hotel was at the rear to go to Fishermans Wharf and was secure as needed room key to open."
8,2120,"Sep 20 2009 	Great location and comfortable room	It couldn't have been a better location if you like a little more touristy area, which we do. After all, we ARE tourists! We love walking, so we very seldom had to use the car, except to go to Golden Gate Park and the Painted Ladies Victorian houses. It was a wonderful experience in a beautiful hotel. The only downside is that it cost over $50/day (with tax) to park! I think that's pretty standard in that area. I would recommend not even having a car and using the buses or cables cars."
9,2120,"Sep 15 2009 	Get A Good Rate-Well Worth The Price	Roooms: newly remodeled, comfortable beds, LCD TV, nice decor.Close to cable cars, and bus line in front of hotel. If you can geta good rate, this hotel is certainly worth staying in. But, having saidthat, the other Marriott hotels in the city are nicer. I found it odd thatthe main hotel restaurant was closed at dinner. The bar area served food. I can't put my finger on it, but something is missingat this hotel. I paid $97 week-end rate which was a great price."
10,2120,"Aug 31 2009 	Great location just OK hotel	The room was not very clean, no amenities and could not get heater to turn to cooler. High cost place with low quality."
11,2120,"Aug 29 2009 	Great Room	The staff at this hotel was friendly and attentive. When we arrived early in the day our room wasn't ready and they held our bags for us while we went for lunch on the Wharf. The hotel was newly remodled so the carpet and wallpaper in the hallways was fresh along with the room. Our room was very clean and comfortable and included a small fridge which was nice. I like my room at a fairly cold temperature and the air conditioner cooled quickly and kept the room at a steady temperature. The shower head was high enough to accomodate taller individuals. The fitness center has new equipment including treadmills, elipticals, and benches to use dumbells on. We could hear some light road noise at night. The hotel is a triangle shape so request an inner room to avoid this. This property exceeded my expectations and I would stay here again."
12,2120,"Aug 27 2009 	Good site for all the sea attraction	Difficult to get 'proper' teabags--only coffee makers available but OK for heating water for tea. Tea obtained from bar in foyer--reluctantly given by staff.Rooms spacious , beds comfortable and bathroom larger than in UK.PC available for booking flight seats online."
13,2120,"Aug 23 2009 	Little Touches Made All the Difference!	While there were fees and tips to be paid, I would come back here in a minute!!!! They really care!!!! Through the online virtual concierge, I requested something special for my little boy, who had never been to SF, not expecting much. What I got was so kind! They left him a box of Valentine's candy (it was Valentine's Day) with baseballs on it and chocolate-dipped strawberries. I was impressed. The beds were very comfortable. There is not much of a view, but the nice beds make up for it. We had a wonderful stay. This is situated right in the middle of Fisherman's Wharf, so it's great for kids."
14,2120,"Aug 19 2009 	Pablo the concierge made all the difference.	Four of us, friends, traveled to San Francisco for the first time. We had investigated ahead of time, but needed help with restaurant suggestions, tours, etc. Pablo, the concierge, took care of us with humor, attentive detail and follow-through. Our trip was wonderful, and he deserves a lot of the credit. The hotel is fine, and it was nice to be in the Wharf area. We will return !"
15,2120,"Aug 10 2009 	It was fine.	Hotel was fine. Location is ok - not too close to the wharf so it isn't in the all the traffic there. Room was clean. Concierge was super friendly and helpful. Parking is ABSURD. $45/day + tax = $52!! Valet only. Comfy bed. Front desk staff was horrible - we called before we arrived and the gentleman we spoke to was rude and would not answer questions. Once we arrived, it was the same attitude. Internet is $12.95/day in the rooms - we paid for the 24 hour period and the service went down about 1am. Asked about 9am when it would be back up and they didn't know, so we asked for a credit since we only had about 8 hours of the 24 hour period. Got attitude from the front desk about that."
16,2120,Aug 5 2009 	Good location - facilities could be better	Hotel is very good located but rooms are pretty old and the service is not so good.
17,2120,"Aug 3 2009 	Watch out for big valet fee!	While I was happy to see that my room rate was about $135/night, I was shocked to learn at check-in that there would be a valet fee of $45/PER NIGHT. And that fee is required. This was not explained to me upon booking the reservation, so what I originally thought was a good rate ($135/night) quickly became a much higher rate than I was willing to pay. While this hotel is in a good location and is clean, you really should know that whatever rate you are quoted when you book will actually be more than $50 higher PER NIGHT, once the valet charge and other taxes and fees are applied.If you are set on staying at Fisherman's Wharf, there are plenty other hotels in the area that I would encourage you to research. This valet fee was ridiculous."
18,2120,Jul 10 2009 	Excellent location. Superb service. Very clean and well maintained.	Exceptional service from the front desk to the bellmen to the valet to housekeeping. We had a Jr Suite. Washer and dryer available at hotel at no additional charge.
19,2120,"Jul 6 2009 	Great Location in San Francisco	I used my Marriott Rewards points to stay at this location for the Fourth of July weekend. Arrived by car on the 3rd at 10:45 in the morning thinking they would park my car and hold our bags until a room is ready for us at the 4:00 check-in time. A great treat to be able to check into a room before 11:00 that morning! Once we handed the keys for valet parking, never needed the car again until leaving after two nights! We rode the bus to the Giants game one evening (bus stop across the street) and took a cab back to the hotel after the game for only $11.50! The next morning we walked a couple of blocks to the cable car starting point and were on our way within 15 minutes. (The earlier the better or be prepared for a long, long line!). Got off the cable car at the end of the line in downtown SF and hopped on the bus to bring us back to the wharf. Great location to walk to great restaurants, Pier 39, etc. Between the concierge, bell captain, and valet guys, getting information was never a problem."
20,2120,"Jun 29 2009 	Great room but look out for a giant valet parking fee!	We stayed at the Marriott Fisherman's Wharf for a mini-vacation. We chose this hotel for its convenient location near Fisherman's Wharf and close proximity to BART so we could go to an Oakland A's game. We took a short cab ride to the Embarcadero BART station to get to the game. The valet was very helpful in getting our cab and the taxi fare was relatively inexpensive. The location is within walking distance to everything in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Our room was very nice, it was in a recently remodeled section and everything was very clean and new. The bed was very comfortable. There was a large flat-screen TV and internet access. Staff was courteous and accommodating. We did receive a bit of a shock when we looked at our hotel bill upon check-out. We expected a valet parking fee because every hotel has a fee for parking. However, a fee of $45.00 per day was added along with $6.33 in parking tax on top of that. This parking fee was not disclosed at check-in. Unfortunately, there are few options if you are driving and plan on parking. There is no street parking available so if you plan on staying, be sure to factor in this $51.33 fee per day into your hotel budget."
21,2120,"Jun 23 2009 	Great Stay	Clean Hotel, Great Location, Friendly Staff, Most Comfortable beds!!! Would recommend"
22,2120,"May 22 2009 	Great location at Fisherman's Wharf with easy MUNI access to North Beach.	I stayed here for a week with business in the Financial District; my previous stay a year and a half earlier was also for a week at the Courtyard at Fisherman's Wharf a block away from the Marriott. I found both to be very satisfactory.The Marriott is between North Point and Bay Street on Columbus Ave with easy MUNI access on two sides of the hotel. The number 10 on the North Point side of the hotel runs east to the Embarcadero then Battery, Samsome and past Market Street in the Financial District. Another MUNI on the Columbus Ave side of the hotel (I don't recall the number) goes through North Beach, but turns off at Stockton in the middle of a bunch of restaurants. Definitely consider scoping out Sodini's Green Valley on Green Street and Firenza.I found the hotel, my room and staff to be very satisfactory. I did not have meals there, so cannot comment on that aspect of the hotel. As with most Marriott hotels, the hotel restaurant / lounge serves their 'premium' brands, but pricing is similar to restaurants in the area and in North Beach.Another comment about the location, the North Beach Shopping Center is about 2 1/2 blocks away on Bay Street. There's a Safeway store there, if you like to browsing for food and stuff as I do (being a single guy). There's also a place called the Blue Mermaid on Jefferson Street the serves up a very cozy nautical breakfast experience. Tarantino's Restaurant is also on Jefferson Street; I seem to always go for the chowder for starters, have the steamed clams bordelaise and add the garlic bread (to soak up some broth) . . . wine makes this combo so tasty.happy travelsgmk"
23,2120,"May 22 2009 	Noisey...Noisey...Not all that	Was not impressed with the hotel. It was noisey, and the rooms where small. Staff was rude. The hotel's website advertised roll away beds, upon check-in the hotel had none! The also charge $50 a day for parking, which was not disclosed until check-in."
24,2120,May 19 2009 	Comfortable hotel at Fisherman's Wharf	The hotel is located in Fisherman's wharf area and it takes around $ 45 by taxi and $ 16 per passenger by shuttle from SFO International airport. The hotel is a stone's throw away from Pier 41 and offers a pretty comfortable and convenient stay. The MUNI tram terminal is also just a couple of blocks away. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within the vicinity of the hotel. Pier 39 is around .75 miles from the hotel and one can either walk down or take the public transport. The hotel has a bar and a restaurant at the lobby level besides a souvenior shop. The concierge is also very efficient and can be quite helpful in organising local sightseeing trips. The rooms were average in size and were done up in a trendy manner and had all the basic ameneties. Overall a had a good stay.
25,2120,"May 12 2009 	Lovely Hotel	We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and would recommend it.Our room was at the end of the hall and had a nice view of Fisherman's Wharf and a peek view of the water. The room was large with two double beds, which were very comfortable. The bathroom was spotless and the shower was great with a large shower head. The location was ideal, as we did not have a car. The public transportation was easy to access from the hotel and the concierge was very helpful in telling us which buses to take. The hotel is located just a block from a Walgreens and a Starbucks, and many other stores within a short distance. I also appreciated the airline check-in kiosk located in the lobby, and being able to print my boarding passes for no charge. I cannot comment on the restaurant, we thought breakfast was a little pricey so we went elsewhere. We booked early and got a great rate which made this hotel a great value for the money."
26,2120,"Apr 27 2009 	GREAT WEEKEND	My husband I planned a night in SF. When we arrived our room was not ready, but that was ok. We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks. The bartender there I believe his name is Juan made great drinks a little pricey but great. The room was ready shortly after we arrived. The room itself was very clean, the bed was sooooooooo comfy. The staff there was excellent from Juan the bartender, to Carmen who checked us in. Mike was the bell man who brought our luggage up. He was very friendly and informative. He put our luggage away for us and was just an all around nice guy. We are definetly going to book this hotel again.The only 2 things I have to say is the little store that's in the hotel is pricey so if you forgot anything or need tylenol or food/drink go to the Walgreens that is a block away down by the wharf. Parking you have to pay for $45 if you are lucking down the street they have parking along the street but you take the risk of someone breaking in."
27,2120,"Apr 20 2009 	Not Impressed by this Marriott	My husband and I stayed at this location from 4/13-4/16 on the 5th floor. The good news is that the location is fantastic. There is a Walgreens, Barnes and Nobles, Trader Joes, Safeway, and numerous restaurants all within walking distance of the hotel.  The bad news is that the rooms are much too small. Check-in was okay but the lady just didn't seem too cheerful or welcoming. Room service took over 45 minutes just to deliver a hamburger past 10:00pm The worst part was that we heard traffic all night long. There was also a howling noise coming from either the wind or a generator outside. It just isn't relaxing on a vacation to hear that much noise.  The best service was provided with the valet attendants and in the bar the night we stopped by to have a couple drinks. They were friendly and welcoming.  We have stayed at quite a few Marriotts in the past and this is by far the most disappointing. I was expecting much more. We filled out a form on-line for concierge service prior to arriving. We had requested extra towels and a welcome package delivered to our room that we would be paying for. We received nothing the day of arrival. Needless to say, this was disappointing. That just shows us how much they really value their guests. We won't be staying at this location again. I'll try the Hyatt down the block."
28,2120,"Apr 20 2009 	Clean and comfortable	We stayed one night here over Easter weekend. Our hotel room was newly renovated and extremely comfortable. The bellman was very friendly and told us where we might like to eat in Chinatown and also how to get there on the cable cars. We were close enough that we walked to both Fisherman's Wharf to sightsee and Ghiradelli Square for ice cream. The kids loved it! This hotel is close to everything! Oh, but parking is expensive! I guess it's expensive anywhere is S.F. but it's $45 a night... so be sure to tack that on any price you are quoted."
29,2120,"Mar 24 2009 	Not up to Marriott standards - Very rude staff!!	Our family went to San Francisco for Spring Break. We made reservations well in advance. Upon arriving at 5:30 pm we were told our room was not ready and that we would have to take a room with a king, not the 2 double beds we had reserved. The desk clerk assured me he would have a roll away sent right up for our daughter. Needless to say, that at 11:00pm that night there was no roll away and we had made 2 calls to the front desk for help. Finally, at 11:30 pm the rollaway arrived with a very hard matress and a paper thin blanket.We have stayed at many Marriott hotels, and have never been treated this poorly. Just a heads up to anyone thinking about booking a room here, I would suggest looking elsewhere. We have also stayed at the Argonaut on Fisherman's Wharf and could not have been happier with the service we received."
30,2120,"Mar 20 2009 	nice but PRICEY with RUDE concierge	We stayed here for 2 nights during our visit to SF. I wish I had been better prepared and &quot;hotel shopped&quot; on this site. (I was discouraged from doing so by hubby who wanted to be &quot;spontaneous&quot;.) With taxes and parking, our room was 199.97/night. This was very comparable to the Hilton and Holiday Inn directly across the street, I ultimately chose Marriott because the person on the telephone was so friendly and accomodating (thank you Cory!). We were very tired upon checkin and had questions about the area/sights etc. The concierge was on break and the gentleman at the desk was most helpful. Our rooms were beautiful with a tiny view of the top of the Golden Gate bridge and the street below. We went back downstairs and the concierge was still &quot;on break&quot;.We went out for dinner at an In&amp;Out burger (did I mention I was with a teenager? lol) and when we came back the concierge was at the lobby checkin desk. I jokingly said &quot;oh there you are!&quot; and he told me he had been on break the 2 previous times we looked for him. He was visiting with another gentleman and was not at his desk. The next morning when I got info from him he told me I had nearly gotten him in trouble with his boss for my comment about his absence.He provided me with the information I requested but didn't seem too friendly. I much preferred getting my info from the friendly folks at the lobby desk. Parking was expensive $40/day. We walked everywhere. The bellman, from Armenia, was super nice as well. I had to do laundry at the hotel as we had been on the road for several days. The laundry room was free w/2 washers/dryers. Due to construction you had to access it from outside the building. This was the only inconvenience during the trip. Overall, we enjoyed our stay but would have looked elsewhere for a better price. for the location, it was great."
