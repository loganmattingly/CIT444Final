279,303,"Mar 21 2009 	Caesars is a great experience if you can afford it . . . . .	We stayed here for 5 nights for a business conference so we didn't choose this hotel based on our own decision making. That said, I am REALLY glad we had the opportunity to stay here. We waited in line for almost a half hour to check in, but once we were there, we were treated quite well the entire time.The casino was nice and spread out. It wasn't too crowded. The food was truly amazing, but you pay for it. It is very expensive. We went to Bobby Flay's twice because it was soooo good. But lunch for two was $100.00The food court was great for the kids, even though the pizza pieces or hot dogs were $5.00 each, they really enjoyed them and the servings were pretty decent.We loved walking around the Forum shoppes and 'browsing'. There are a lot of great things to look at and the kids loved the shows.We even had a wonderful housekeeper who came every day at the same time. A lot of times the kids and I were still in the room and she was very kind. Very polite and friendly.The location was great, we walked over to the other nearby hotels and I always felt safe and comfortable.I really can't say enough great things about the hotel and our stay. We had a great time. We reviewed and looked at their website enough to know ahead of time what the prices would be to feed a family of five. If you go there knowing you are going to be spending a little more than other hotels then you are not disappointed or overwhelmed. Just go and have a great time!"
280,303,Mar 21 2009 	Disappointed	From reading the reviews on Ceasar's it seems it depends on where you stay in the hotel. My husband and I paid $200.00 a night to stay in the Roman tower and I was so disappointed when I opened the door. The first room had no bathroom door and I refused to stay in a room like that so we were given another room down the hall which was probably a little worse but had a BR door. Everything must have been there since the Romans. It was old with cracked paint and door casings in the hall the carpet was not very clean and you couldn't use a calling card from the room. I live in Nova Scotia which is big in tourism and you wpuld find a better roon at Comfort Inn. We made the best of it and had a great time but I would be more selective the next time.
281,303,"Mar 20 2009 	Its glory is past.	The current treachery propagated by Caesars involves enticing unwitting victims to their lair with the promise of low rates. However, the rooms associated with these rates are so miserable and uncomfortable, the guests are forced to pay extra ($50-60/night) to upgrade to more civilized rooms. The bed in the cheaper rooms (Roman Tower) is as comfortable as a sandpaper toga. If this is what the Romans slept on, no wonder their empire fell. Also, the staff at Caesars Palace is as warm, inviting and communicative as the many faux marble statues scattered throughout the casino. Actually that is not fair - the statues never did anything to anyone. Finally, if you do decide to brave one of the rooms in the Roman Tower, either travel alone or with someone you know very well. Otherwise, the complete lack of a bathroom door will make you closer than you ever wanted to be. I would not stay here again."
282,303,"Mar 20 2009 	Was Very Shocked	My friend and I stayed at Ceasars for three very LONG days. Our room was HORRIBLE! Our toilet was not attached to the floor properly. Our view was of the airconditioning system. Our room was located above a bar and the music sounded as if it was in our room. Our beds sunk in the middle. Took FOREVER to get HOT water in the shower! Upon checkout I voiced my concerns about the room and was not taken seriously at ALL. I am not one to cause a scene. So when I arrived hom I called Ceasars and asked to speak to a manager and was pretty much told OH WELL! My husband and I are going back to Vegas in two months to celebrate our 15 wedding anniversary and guess where we will NOT BE STAYING? Can you say CEASARS!NEVER again will I spend my hard EARNED money in such a crappy hotel. I have stayed at Best Westerns with NICER ROOMS and BETTER SERVICE!On a happy note my friend and I transfered from Ceasars to THE RIO, and were treated like QUEENS!"
283,303,"Mar 18 2009 	We had an excellent time - large group of parents and teenagers!	We stayed in the Augustus Tower, room 3691. We had an excellent view of the strip and the Bellagio fountain, in the other distance were the mountains. It was like a TV show at night with all the lights and fountain shows. Our room was large, with a nice table, couch, chairs, large flat screen TV, and 2 double beds, very comfortable and large. The bathroom was overthetop luxurious. The two pools were excellent. With a large group of teens I would suggest sending someone out to bring in pizzas, salads, drinks, bagels, and fruit."
284,303,"Mar 18 2009 	Worst service in Neros.	terrible food, terrible service I've ever had.The steak i've ordered in medium was burned out, no juicy at all.. and they swiched my steak to another dish, but still same..No waiter came to ask about may steak after that, Even I'd room charged my bill, they asked my ID because they didn't see my name, it was on the second line on the system,. they could find. and also I think could matched with sign card. Even they didn't appologize for inconvinient. Hotel room was great with view of bellagio."
285,303,"Mar 17 2009 	Caesars Is At The Center Of All The Fun!	My wife and I just stayed at this awesome resort and will definitely stay there again. Check in was very quick, which I was a little nervous about because it is such a big resort. When checking in we upgraded to the Forum Tower which was great because it is right in the center of all the fun. Our room was very clean and the bed very comfortable. I have stayed at several Las Vegas resorts and the bed at Caesars was by far the best. The dining and shopping at the Forum Shops is great because there is a ton of variety. The only recommendation that I would give to someone staying there is if you want to go to the pool be sure and get down there early so you can find seating. The staff at the hotel was very friendly and invited us back which I am sure my wife and I will definitely be staying there again!"
286,303,"Mar 16 2009 	Great Hotel I couldn't have asked for more.	I stayed at Caesars on a solo trip from March 3rd to March 8th in the Augustus Tower. My whole stay was very good. The room was large and very nicely decorated in neutral tones. The pillows, sheets and bed were extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and fully marble and spotlessly clean.Caesars is slap bang in the middle of the strip so one can't ask for a more central location.The restaurants and bars, shopping and gambling options are almost endless.I would definitely reccommend Caesars Palace to family and friends.I had a bit of an incident in the poker room one night and at my request I was tended to by the Casino Manager who sorted out the issue promply and professionally.The waitresses and slot attendants were very friendly and efficient. As a female travelling alone I felt totally safe at this hotel.Over all Caesars is a pretty good bet."
287,303,"Mar 15 2009 	Some headaches but overall a good experience	Overall, my Caesars Palace experience was a good one. I went with a group of college friends for a few days, as we got a excellent deal on the hotel room. However, we believe that since we booked our hotel on a discount site (hotels.com), we were viewed as less important than other guests at the hotel when it came to service.When we called to confirm our reservation, we requested two adjacent rooms. However, when we checked in, they didn't even give us the type of room we paid for, let alone adjacent rooms. They promised a room switch at noon the following day when we brought this up at the desk, and said they'd be adjacent. Noon comes around and we find the new rooms aren't even on the same floor. Finally, we get them to put us in adjacent rooms (deluxe in the Augustus Tower, which is what we paid for) and they promise to call us between 3 and 5. At ten minutes to five, as they haven't called our rooms or our contact person's cell phone, our contact goes downstairs to find our rooms were ready. If we hadn't claimed them by 5, they would have been given to other guests. The room change was a headache.But incredibly worth it. The views were spectacular (we had a great view of the Bellagio fountains) and Caesars is excellently located with respect to other hotels and casinos, right in the middle of the strip. The coupon book we were provided with at check-in proved to help a lot, as we're college kids (lots of free food or discounts on meals).Both rooms were very clean and quiet, and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom facilities in the first room (Palace Tower) were a little outdated, but still nice. The hotel was also very prompt in bringing extra towels and some amenities we'd forgotten (toothbrushes and deodorant).A small mix up also worked out in our favor. The previous guest in the first room we'd been assigned to had apparently spent a good deal of money in the casino and she'd been comped free food and bottles of water, all of which was sitting untouched and unopened when we arrived. When we mentioned this to the desk, they'd informed up she'd checked out and told us we were welcome to the food. Yay for free fruit and water after a long day of traveling!Additionally, the last full day of our stay, the pool reopened. Honestly, the pool alone may have made the trip for me, as I love to swim and Caesars' pools are gorgeous."
288,303,"Mar 15 2009 	Absolute Vegas	We just came back from four nights in Vegas, first visit. Bought a very reasonable package out of Toronto, picked Ceasars Palace becouse I've seen pix in the magazines etc, and wanted to have a real Vegas Experience. We arrived at 9AM to check in, no line up, were told our package puts us into the old part of the hotel, tried the $20.00 trick to get a room upgrade to Augustus tower, somebody must've been watching, the young lady on the desk wouldn't go for it, so, after some negotiating we paid extra $25/nite for renovated room in the Palace tower, we got in right away! Nice, big, clean, renowated room with a double Jaccuzi tub, shower, lots of marble and nice towels and sheets too. 23 floor overlooking the parking lot, but high enough to see the pool at the Mirage and the Strip. Food at the hotel as elsewhere on the Strip expensive, but mostly good.The place is HUGE, takes 20 mins to walk from the lobby to the selfparking lot, we drove to the Red Rock Canyon, hiked for an hour, beautifull, then down to Hoover Dam, very intersting, all in one day, no rushing, recomend it! Also, spend an evening Downrown, after all the faux class of the strip, it felt somehow more real and a lot of fun, the light show on Fremont strreet is well worth the bus fare! Back at the hotel, check out the Forum shops, amazing details and workmanship, engeneering of the whole place is mindblowing, must have cost a fortune. We dont gamble, and after seeing what gamblers money can build, will never gamble for sure! We will go back in 10 years to see all the new buildings."
289,303,"Mar 13 2009 	Outstanding Service!	On this short, one-night business trip, I found the level of service across the board to be exceptional at Caesars. From the reception clerk (Terran) to room service to the security guards, everyone was exceedingly friendly and helpful. Straight A's across the board - except: the bell desk was rather offhand about rental of a wheelchair (C+), and lost and found, which gets an A+ for going above and beyond, tracking down a beloved jacket and arranging to have it sent to this forgetful traveler.Also, I appreciated that guest rooms for those attending the conference were just an elevator ride away from the conference itself."
290,303,"Mar 12 2009 	Casears is Las Vegas	It was our first trip to Las Vegas, and we were very glad that we stayed at Caesars. You seriously cannot beat the location as it is in the heart of the strip and within walking distance to almost all the other hotels. We booked a bare bones room through a travel site and when checking in, slipped the clerk a $20 bill and got upgraded to a suite in the Augustus Tower with a beautiful view of the strip. You would have to be crazy not to try the $20 trick...it is Vegas after all and it runs on tips. I read all the other reviews of Caesars before coming and was a little wary, but it is a fantastic hotel and while not as extravagant as a Bellagio or Palazzo, it is still a Vegas institution and definitely recommend it. Also, Spago in the Forum Shops was amazing, go there for a meal, you will not regret it!"
291,303,"Mar 11 2009 	new tower is very nice	check in offered to upgrade to the new Augustus tower for $40 a night so i took it I am gald i did. The room was very large nice plasma tv very well decorated no greek theme I liked that it was modern and nice evevators were fast. A few things about the room it was a bit noisy from loud neighbors, the bathroom amenities were very nice but i missed having qtips. The Qua spa was beautifulA few tips I saw Cher and it was great just do not by the really expensive cocktails in the theater not great. The gourmet chocolate shop wonderful and the cool machine in it spits out free chocolates every so often for you to sample. Noodle place was fantastic."
292,303,"Mar 11 2009 	It was better than I thought...	My wife and I just got back from Vegas, we stayed there March 4-7th. We ended up getting to the hotel to check in around 430pm and we only waited around 10-15min. The front desk person tried to upsell us a different room and we declined because my dad purchased this room for us and we didnt want to pay extra money. We stayed in the Roman Tower and when we got to the room, we had mirrors on the cieling and a hot tub in the bedroom. Oh and a see through bathroom (nice touch) Our view from the room was of the pool that had constustion but we could see the sunset and a good view of the Palms (which is where we will stay next time) and the Rio. When we got to the room it was clean and we had no issues. I lived in Vegas for almost 2 years and I still got lost in this hotel. I started to figure it out only one day in but still. This place is huge. The only things we played at Caesar's was penny/nickel slots. We went across the street to O'Shea's to play table games since it was cheaper. We didnt eat anywhere in this hotel so I cant say anything about that but over all it was a nice room and the people working thier were kind. Dont even think about checking out at the front desk on a fri-sun, for its WAY to busy. We carried all our stuff downstairs and then saw the line at the front desk and I wold have been in line for like an hour. So we went back to the room...checked our balance and checked out through the TV...much easier. If you have any questions you can always ask me. I am a travel agent so I will give you all the info I have. Peace out from Dallas."
293,303,"Mar 9 2009 	Serious Security Problems	Checked in to a large comfortable room, I had good expectations for my stay. I was awaken at 4am by loud noises in the hallway and someone banging at my door. I called security and they said &quot;no problem, they would check it out.&quot; I never heard back from security. When I came out of my room in the am, the hallway was littered with smashed ice buckets. Other guests on the floor informed me that this was going on previous nights. I contacted the manager was moved to a room on another floor. The next night, someone entered my room at 4.30 am saying they were checked into this same room. A few minutes later, the bellman came to my door to collect my luggage. When I called the manager, they said I was not checked into this room. The next morning, I talked to another manager about the incident and they reported that I was checked into that room. When I returned from breakfast to my room, the key no longer worked. The serious security issues and the cavalier way the management handled my situation indicates problems. I wouldn't recommend a place where I didn't feel safe."
294,303,"Mar 9 2009 	Great place to stay will do it again this year! Room was a comp deal...	Spent March 4th~6th in Vegas to celebrate my B-day. Caesars sent me an offer for 3 free nights plus $200 travel cash and the room that was booked on the offer was a deluxe room in the Forum Tower. Before I even arrived, they had upgraded me to a deluxe room in the Augustus Tower which I highly recommend to anyone booking a room there. The rooms are 650 sq. ft. and are essentially a mini-suite, they have very nice ammenities but the one thing they could certainly splurge on is toilet paper, that paper is rough! Overall (considering it was a free stay) I would recommend this hotel to anyone but the casino wasn't very generous to me. What are you gonna do though, this place wasn't built by giving money out to everyone that gambled there! Will probably stay there again this coming August when I return to Vegas....."
295,303,"Mar 8 2009 	Great location and two-person showers - love it!	Stayed here for 5 nights in Feb - it was a good stay. We were upgraded at check-in to a suite in the Palace Towers. Single LCD TV, jacuzzi tub, 2 bathrooms with 2 toilets and a large two-person shower... awesome.The Palace Tower is nice, although if you can get a suite in the Augustus Tower, that would be nicer for the views. Our suite was looking at the new Octavius Tower that's almost done... surprisingly, there's not much construction noise.Pros:- Nice upgrade and suite - Great central location on the strip- Love the Forum shops- It's classic Caesars... yes the Wynn and the Palazzo are swankier, but there's something nice about the history here.Cons:- They charge for everything... wish they would provide free internet- The fridge is filled with their items on sensor - we moved stuff aroudn for our own items and had to get the bill adjusted at the end- Pools currently closed for renos - I suspect it'll be nice when they're doneI enjoyed it and was glad we got the upgrade after reading horror stories about the standard rooms. Would come back again."
296,303,"Mar 7 2009 	Overpriced	I was booked by my company to the Roman Tower. When I stepped out of the cab, there was no one to assist you. The nearest elevator from the Registration was broken. It was a maze and a long walk to the next set of elevators but no bell boy was in sight as I dragged my 45 lb. luggage. From inside my room, I can hear the slamming of doors outside, talking in the next rooms as well as the alarm getting off from the next door. The room is spacious though and the amenities provided were good.To use the internet, it costs $25 per day and to use the gym, it is $45 a day. I think these services should have been included in the per night cost.The hotel is gorgeous though but I value my room more since I don't gamble.I transferred to Stratosphere after my conference. I find it much better for the price."
297,303,"Feb 28 2009 	Wonderful stay--would do it again in a heartbeat!	A friend and I were in Las Vegas for a great 4 days. We throughly enjoyed our stay at Caesar's. I'm usually in Vegas two to three times a year and this was my first time staying at the Palace. The front desk staff was wonderful !!! Room service was great--our food came in less time than was predicted and was piping hot and very,very good. The location is great !!!  When we were checking in we were given an upgrade to the Augustus Tower and our room overlooked the Bellagio Fountains---What a great view!!!! After a long day of walking the strip it was great to relax in the spa tub.  I absolutely love Caesar's and will probably stay there again on my next trip out !!!!!!"
298,303,"Feb 24 2009 	Thank you Trip Advisor Members: Caesars Vegas!!	Many thanks to the Trip Advisor Members. I read many reviews before heading to Vegas and the tips really helped. ROOM: Requested Augustus Tower per your reviews. Room was modern and lovely. People were complaining about the Roman Tower but I wasn't there because of your reviews. HOTEL: Beautiful. Tables were mostly $25 blackjack but you're just across the street from O'Sheas. Your True Rewards card works there too so whether you want high end or low end tables, they are right across the street from each other.CHECK IN: As per your reviews, check in was a nightmare...but we were mentally prepared. They have clearly cut back on staff and waiting 45 minutes for your room (at 10pm) is never good, but after reading your reviews I expected it. Those who hadn't been forewarned were FREAKING OUT in line. Especially the older people, my god there were some people flipping. A hotel of this caliber shouldn't let this happen, but with the economy in the dumps (especially in Vegas) you've got to assume there are going to be some cutbacks. Again, inexcusable but at least a bit understandable.DINNER: Rao's. UNREAL. If you're trashing Rao's in a review then perhaps you didn't know what you were getting into. Food there is top notch. No one wants to pay $48 for Veal Parm but when it's the best you've ever had....$48 seems like $10."
299,303,"Feb 23 2009 	Word of Advice	Last July, my girlfriend and I booked a room at Caesar's Palace through Yahoo! Travel. We booked a standard room with a free upgrade. When we got to the hotel I mentioned the free upgrade to the guy at check-in and he said that they didn't have any more available for the upgrade we had booked. The hotel didn't seem that busy to me so I'm not sure why they didn't have an available room. Fortunately, my girlfriend is very attractive (I don't know how I managed to get her LOL) and happened to be wearing a very big QVC canary diamond ring. The guy obviously noticed it and made a comment about it. Then he said that he would make a call and see what he could do about the upgrade. After getting off the phone, he gave us our keys and told us to enjoy our stay. He also suggested we eat at Joe's Stone Crab, which we did do and really enjoyed. We didn't know what to expect when we got to our room because he didn't tell us if we were upgraded or not. We were very pleasantly surprised to see that he had upgraded us to a suite. The room had been completely remodeled, with flat screen, new furniture, great view, very comfortable bed, etc..... Moral of the story is..............if you are physically attractive and treat employees at Caesar's Palace or any hotel/casino for that matter, with kindness and respect, you will enjoy your stay and may even get more than you ever expected. I could have easily started making demands and started complaining about how I had just driven for 4 hours and created a scene, when he told me there were no rooms available, but I didn't. I just acted like it was no big deal and because of that, he was willing to help out. I would strongly recommend staying here, everything was great. I strongly recommend Pure if you are in the 21-30 demographic. If you come to Caesar's and expect to pinch pennies........don't. There are places like Imperial Palace and Palace Station for that."
300,303,"Feb 23 2009 	I like Caesar's	This was my third time in Vegas. Stayed at T.I. and Monte Carlo in the past. Caesar's was definitely my favorite of the three. I booked a standard room in the Roman Tower via hotel.com for $90/night. There seemed to be overwhelming disapproval of these rooms from other members on this site, so I upgraded at the front counter to the Palace Tower. We tried to talk the front desk attendant into a free upgrade, but to no avail. We paid an extra $60/night, which was supposedly a great deal - a result of the bad economy. Speaking of the economy, I didn't notice much of a difference in the amount of people visiting over the weekend. The nightclubs, etc. were still packed/hectic. Anyway, our room was great! Very spacious and extremely clean. I'm not much of a gambler, but the casino was essentially smoke-free compared to some of the other hotels. I always visit Caesar's for the mall and nightclubs, but had been unable to stay in the past due to the high rates. I was very excited to be able to stay this time, and would do so again if given the opportunity. (I'm giving the hotel 4/5 stars - but keep in mind this is based primarily off my Palace Tower room. If the Roman Tower is as bad as others' claim it to be, I'm sure my opinion would change. FYI the pool is closed. Try the restaurant across from the front desk for great late night dining.)"
301,303,"Feb 22 2009 	Caesar's: overpriced poor service	We just returned from 4 nights at Caesar's, the first hotel in Vegas that ever made me consider checking out early. It is amazingly overpriced - equivalent or superior rooms and amenities are available just about everywhere else on the strip. For the price, the room was very small. It also had a huge shower with more than enough room for a tub - something I always look forward to using on vacation - but instead there was only some pseudo-roman bathing bench. The TV was in pretty bad shape, about the worst signal I've seen on a hotel flatscreen. No changing of the sheets either, though unfortunately that seems to be the norm these days.When we checked in, we discovered that our minibar was not working. After three calls and at least two visits to the room, it was finally fixed. Upon checkout we discovered that we were charged $400 for the entire contents of the minibar - presumably when they removed the contents to fix it. Thankfully they were willing to remove the charge, but it was just another step in incompetence for this hotel. Service was generally terrible overall. We called for a wake-up call our first morning, but we never received it. Lines for everything are incredibly long and move slowly. There is also no security anywhere here apparently - I don't know if they've cut back, but every other hotel I've ever been to in Vegas had guards checking room keys at the elevator banks. Not so at Caesar's, and by the looks of some of the casino patrons, we didn't exactly feel safe. Some kids were having a party on our floor one night, and playing bass so loud that our room was vibrating til 4 am - no response from security there, either.And on top of all this, Caesar's somehow remains one of the higher-priced hotels on the strip. I don't know how they can possibly keep it up with the standards they display. You can do much better (for a better price) at most other hotels, especially if you shop around - the Mirage, MGM Grand, The Venetian/Palazzo, Mandalay Bay or Paris would all be improvements over Caesar's."
302,303,"Feb 21 2009 	Enjoyed the luxory but check your bill at check out.	We enjoyed our stay to the fullest. The room was fantastic and the staff were very friendly and helpful. There are a few buts, so keep watch for extra and unnecessary charges. At check-in we were offered the upgrade to a mini-suite for only $62 and that would include certain extras and a jacuzzi in the room. We declined. Guess what we got anyway.....a mini-suite with a jacuzzi in the room. Then we got lost and ended up in the wrong tower trying to find our room. The most helpful employee offered assistance and took us through a maze of behind the scenes corridors, hallways, elevators and so on. Before we knew it we were at our room. All the staff we encountered were so friendly and helpful in all aspects. Upon checking out we had charges for the minibar on our tab even though we didn't use anything. Here's the catch! If you lift something up out of the minibar to even look at it, you will be charged. There are sensors that detect when something has been lifted up. Pretty amazing. They took the charge off immediately when we brought it to their attention. Also here is a first. We ordered a movie to watch in bed one night which was great, but you better plan on watching it all in one shot. You don't get it for 24 hours and are not able to pick up where you left off the next morning if you fell asleep during the first time you tried to watch it. No going back. That was a first and I must say dissappointing feature they have incorporated. And last but not least, the free valet parking is a real treat in all the madness of staying on the strip. Just loved that feature. All in all our first time staying at Caesars was most enjoyable. The accomodations were very roomy with lots of little luxories, great room service even though a little pricey, but hey, its Caesars and the breakfast really was delicious. We got a package deal on this stay which was one of the best anyone in Vegas had ever heard of. Oh yeah, the one real let down is the crazy fee they charge to use the fitness room facilities. $45 for an hour workout on their equipement. Sorry that is not a good service at all. We did not pay for that."
303,303,"Feb 18 2009 	Caesar's Palace is Extraordinary!	Booked trip via expedia and was originally booked into a Classic room in the Roman tower. After reading many reviews about the older tower I knew we couldnt let the hotel room ruin our very first Vegas vacation.Checked in late on Thursday night of the Valentine's/Presidents Day long weekend. Check in line was short and we reached the front in about 10 minutes. I slipped the girl a twenty with my ID and credit card and asked if there were any upgrades available. To my delight we were upgraded to a Deluxe room in the Palace tower.The room was outstanding! What a fantastic upgrade. Two sinks in the HUGE bathroom, Jacuzzi tub, separate shower and private toilet. The bedding was very luxurious, carpets and linens were so clean! It felt like we were the first to stay in the room. The view wasnt great, we looked out over on the pool construction and the Octavius tower construction, but that was a small inconvenience. The pool was closed for renovations, but it was not warm enough to be taking advantage of that anywways.Housekeeping were courteous and very friendly. Our room was immaculate each time we returned. Top notch staff at this amazing hotel!Had room service on the first morning for breakfast. Wait time was about an hour for the food, but it came up piping hot and delicious. Prices were a little high but this is Vegas after all. Payards Pastierre was also a great place to get coffee in the morning, line ups can get a bit long. But again, its Vegas and thats to be expected.We signed up for the rewards card and got food vouchers for Caesars restaurants. Together with comps that we had gotten for playing at the tables one night, we had over $100.00 in food vouchers. We used them at Augustus Caf, which is the 24 hour restaurant located in the base of the Augustus tower. The food was delicious and the portions were very large. We both had enough left over for a midnight snack and the meal was essentially free. Definitely sign up for the rewards card to get all kinds of coupons and savings at Caesars.The gaming area is huge, but the minimum bets on most of the tables are very high. We went across to the Flamingo for lower limits. Also checked out Pure nightclub with the VIP passes received at check in. Very swanky club, but the drink prices were astronomical. Will probably do a bottle service with more people if we return.Caesars location cannot be beat, right in the middle of the strip. We walked everywhere. The Forum shops were fun to walk through, very high end merchandise. The Fashion Show mall across from Treasure Island is where we did a bulk of our shopping.My boyfriend golfed at the Balli Hai golf course and raved about it the entire trip. It was the highlight of the weekend for him and he greatly recommends this course to golfers. It was a short cab ride from the hotel and club rentals are available.The only complaint I have about Caesars is that the mini bar in the room was sensored. I had been taking out items in order to store personal water bottles and food, but once an item is removed you are charged for it. I noticed this upon checkout and the charges were removed from the bill. I will definitely stay at Caesars again but will not settle for anything less than the Palace tower."
304,303,Feb 16 2009 	Lost its luster	Never again. The ventilation in the casino is awful. Pure cigarette smell. They tried to put us in the Roman Tower but I had read to many bad reviews so I asked for the Augustus which was sold out. They had the Palace Tower available for a $40.00 upcharge. COME ON. The rooms were very well appointed but dirty and already looking worn. I don't think they vacuumed once when we were there. (we monitored nuts that we hadn't eaten remain the whole trip). There were urine and throw up stains on the wallpaper in the commode area as well as water stains on the silk bedskirt. Our toilet wouldn't flush one day and when maintenance fixed it they said housekeeping uses bars of soap to clean the toilets because the hotel doesn't provide enough cleaning supplies. Sure enough a bar of soap was caught inside. Concierge was soooooo slow and inept. There was no security anywhere. The spa was beautiful and well appointed that was the highlight. No plans on going back; ever.
305,303,"Feb 16 2009 	do not upgrade	I upgraded to a deluxe room on hotels. com , for a 5 day stay, the front desk put us at the forum tower I told the desk clerk that this was incorrect I booked a room in the Palace or August Tower. After that I asked for a room on a high floor the clerk gave us the 51 floor really 2 floor. Treated like a second class no third class person because i booked on hotels.com. Overall the room was nice the TV didn't work the whole time. Room was extremely clean and maid was the friendlest person that worked their. After I got home have sent them a e-mail demanding a refund for the different rate in rooms. Hotel is nice just be careful at check in and demand what you paided for extremely arrogent front check in desk. Room was decorated nicely and the bed was extremely comfortable."
306,303,"Feb 16 2009 	Gitcha A_ _ back in the room!	We go to Vegas 1 to 2 times a year for fun and business. We thought it would be nice to stay at Caesars, we had visited the property many times before, but had never stayed there. We checked in on Sat. afternoon, with no problem. The room was small with a view of a giant air compressor. All around the edges of the room you could see dust where they were missing it when sweeping. We called down at 5pm and asked for 2 more pillows, never got them. Called again at 11pm and they came up 20 min. later. We ate dinner at Hyakumi, one of Caesars premier japanese eaterys. We both got food pisening from their &quot;Caesar roll&quot;, I know this becuase it was the only thing we both tasted. Back in the room, we now learned that the toilet was not flushing properly. This was unfortunate, oweing to our extensive use of it, thanks to our $150.00 food poisening! At 3:35 am we were disturbed by loud noise out side our room. It turned out to be some twentysomething kids, running up and down the hallways, and screaming at each other. This went on for 20 min., we called security. My wife opened the door, explained the obvious and was insulted for her trouble. A drunk hispanic man informed her that he was on vacation and could do as he pleasee, and that she should, &quot; shut up and gitcha [--] back in the room. Unable to help as I was &quot;again&quot; in dispose in the bathroom, I could only listen. We called again and where in formed that security was on the way. By the time they arrived, the people had left, ofcourse. I called down to the desk and asked if I could check out early (we were scheduled to stay 3 more days. The clerk said we could, but they would be charging us for 1 night in addition to the night we'd stayed! In the morning my wife checked us out, and relayed our story to the day staff. They were apologetic and did not charge us an extra night. We moved to South Point and the rest of our trip was great. I've had my fill of the strip on the weekends, and will stay off strip from now on."
307,303,"Feb 16 2009 	Caesar's was great!	We booked a package through WestJetVacations.com. We chose Caesar's because we took it to be a fine hotel in the middle of the strip where all the action is. The hotel itself is beautiful although, in some places it is starting to show it's age. The check-in line was fairly long when we arrived but it went surprisingly fast and had to wait no longer than a few minutes to reach the desk. The gentleman checking us in was very friendly and offered a room upgrade for only $50 per night. We took it. They even let us check-in early by about 3 hours. This was a blessing in itself after a long day of travel. The room was very nice. Two separate bathrooms, a shower built for two, a huge jacuzzi tub and a very spacious room. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was inviting and clean. We loved this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone.We stayed in the Palace Tower. If the pool was open, the Palace Tower is the place to be, it is located right beside the pool area. The casino staff was fun and friendly. Check out the Pussycat Dolls area!The only thing I can say that was a pain was the distance to the tower but one could complain about that with any large hotel on the strip. Also the food and drinks were very expensive so I recommend eating and drinking elsewhere (unless your gambling). Again this is true for many of the newer, larger hotels. If you want cheap drinks and a great time, go to Freemont Street, watch the light show and listen to Carl 'Safe Sax' Ferris play his many different saxophones. That was awesome!"
308,303,"Feb 16 2009	Love Caesars'  just a few things you should know	Caesars' Palace is a Las Vegas legend and even though it doesn't have a 5 star or 5 diamond rating, i still consider it to be a very high class and luxurious destination. However, there are a few things you should know in order to make sure you have a good experience here. Let me start off with accommodations. The Augustus Deluxe, Palace Deluxe, and Palace Premium rooms are the best rooms you could find at Caesars' and are also the newest. The rooms in the Augustus tower are brand-new and the Palace tower rooms are remodeled to resemble the Augustus tower with only a few minor differences. These rooms are very nice, with spa tubs, and contemporary designs. The beds are fantastic and very comfortable. Also the rooms are a very good size, but you must know that the Augustus tower rooms have a different bathroom than the regular Palace room and the premium Palace room. The Augustus bathroom is roomier with a different design and a flat screen TV. The Palace tower bathrooms are the original Caesars' bathrooms from before the remodel which are still very nice but sometimes they are not in the best condition. The Palace Premium room is a very nice room, but in my opinion not worth the extra price per night, if you're comped this room then great, but otherwise it is not worth it. The only significant difference is that the Premium room has his and her bathrooms, no biggie. For some reason, Caesars' decided to go with the cheesy modern designs in the Forum Tower remodel just like the rest of Vegas is doing. I wouldn't recommend staying in these rooms unless you like the style or you get a very good deal, since at least they are brand new. Under NO circumstances should you ever book a room in the Roman or Centurion towers at Caesars', i am being very serious, those rooms are in horrible conditions, almost motel 6 status. If the &quot;Classic&quot; room is the only thing available, you should try the Wynn/Encore down the street, or Bellagio if they have a good deal. Also most of the time Caesars' is a little overpriced when it comes to rooms, be careful. Sometimes a classic room at Caesars' turns out to be the same price or more as a room at the Bellagio or a suite at Encore on a weeknight. Now lets move onto dinning. Caesars' has a very large selection of dinning choices. If you are on a tight budget however, i suggest either sticking to the Augustus Cafe, or dinning somewhere else. Because the fine dinning is amazing at Caesars' but the casual stuff, not so much. Stay away from the Cafe Lago buffet, trust me. It has a very small selection, overpriced, and isn't even that good. If you want great food try Spago, Sushi Roku, BOA, Trevi, Neros, and Bradley Ogden. Those are all great choices.As for the pool, its pretty chill and relaxing. Nice environment, large area, just nothing too special. Perfect place to lounge around and have a drink, or read a book.Also you should know that a tip a Caesars' goes a long way. When you're checking in, slipping a 50 or a 100 in with you I.D. and Credit Card could score you a beautiful suite. Most of the time if you ask &quot;What can you do for me?&quot; they'll even give you a choice. I have always had a comped stay at Caesars' but i have been upgraded by tipping a 50 from an Augustus Deluxe room to a one bedroom suite in the Augustus tower. It all depends on how you approach the front desk and how your attitude is. Be very friendly, and you'll always get what you want.That is about it, i know a lot about this property so please trust my advice and don't make any mistakes that could leave a bad impression of Caesars' in your mind."
309,303,"Feb 14 2009 	Not a good place to stay - NOT going back to Caesars	Got a good last minute rate, and said WOW, gotta try Caesars. We cancelled Paris.... BIG MISTAKE Stayed in the Roman tower, room was large, but outdated and dirty. Had to get houskeeping in to clean up sticky phone, red residue all over the couch, the bulbs in the lamps did not work, the hairdryer did not not work (and housekeeper said it was broken for 3 months), the electrical outlets were falling out of the wall, and the heater/airconditioner sounded like a rocket about to take off. The room had two other doors to two adjacent rooms, and you could hear every word from the other rooms as the doors had no bottom seals. We could cleary hear one couple express their love for each other thoughout the night! Called front desk on a few occasions and was ignored for more than an hour.... finally had the housekeeping supervisor show up she was embarassed by the state of the room. They did a deep clean while we were out, and left us some chocolate coins as compensation..... big deal! Will never go back to stay at Ceasars again, not even to the casino!"
310,303,"Feb 13 2009 	Mixed reviews	We got a good rate on this hotel by monitoring the website. We booked once and cancelled to take advantage of better rates. We stayed in the Augustus tower checking in on a Wednesday and checking out Saturday afternoon. The check in was easy since it was 11:00pm. We got the exact room we requested. The Augustus Tower is in a good location compared to the casino/bars/restaurants/strip. We were on the 34th floor looking out at the Bellagio. We could see the fountain show and had a decent view fo the strip. Our room was nice. It had two beds, couch, cofee table, mini dining table and a nice flat screen tv. The bathroom was big and had a little tv in it, a seperate closet for the comode, and a seperate tub/shower. I have three concerns with the room: 1)The room did not seem clean. There was a lot of dust and the bathroom felt dirty. 2) The linens were old and worn. The bath towels were very old and borderline nasty. They reminded me of the towels my health club provides...not nice and very worn. The sheets were also worn and flimsy. 3) Room service was disgustingly priced. The delivery time was about 45 minutes and that I can understand. But to charge $70 for a few bagels/cream cheese and some juice and coffee is absurd and almost criminal:)The Casino was fun and we usually had no trouble getting drinks. We both broke about even playing blackjack and went on some legendary runs. Real fun. The restaurants were unbelievable. We ate dinner at Raos(pronounced Ray-ohs), Joes in the Forum Shops, and Bobby Flays Mesa Grille for lunch. I will be doing reviews of all three of them shortly so look for those but lets say they were all good with Joes and Raos being the best! The best thing to me about Caesars is the location. It is smack dab in the center of the strip and you can walk everyhwere.I would stay at Caesars again but only in a new room as I have heard the older ones are pretty bad. However, next time I go I will have lowered expectations of the rooms."
311,303,"Feb 13 2009 	My Most Favorite Hotel in Vegas	I have stayed at many great hotels but I will always love CP the best. The service is exceptional, they treat me like royalty (literally, red carpet and all)....the suites are great, the 2 floor Rainman Suite has wonderful rounded windows looking out to the entire city.... Pools &amp; jacuzzis are grand. The hosts are simply the best. They make sure you are pampered and well fed :) AhSo's used to be my fave restaurant (10 course Japanese meals while you are surrounded by waterfalls and wild orchids). That has been replaced by Hyakumi. I love Neros as well... I have been to most of the large, advertised hotel shows but am fond of the smaller, local concerts. I lived in Vegas for years (Green Valley, Nevada~beautiful!) so I am very familiar with every hotel but when we visit, it is always Caesars Palace :) Need I mention the fabulous Forum Shops??? The malls in LV cannot be beat...If you are staying a while, check out the local hotels such as Sam's Town...I love Sams! Don't expect luxery &amp; glitter but expect fun &amp; cuteness. Their indoor atrium is very cool...love the mountain light show &amp; my favorite howling wolf :) Mohegan Sun stole the exact show but I love both. Steakhouse has great coconut shrimp &amp; don't forget to try their Strawberry TALL Cake~trust me, it's an experience! Get up to Mt. Charleston &amp; rent a log cabin as a fun getaway..Bonnie Springs, Nevada has a zoo...I love Vegas and loved showing my husband all around Nevada."
312,303,"Feb 12 2009 	Girlfriends' Weekend at Caesar's Palace	I was frankly a litle wary of staying at Caesar's Palace, based on many of the Trip Advisor reviews, but a girlfriend booked the trip, so off we went. I did pore over the many reviews available, and took the advice of so many, to absolutely not stay in the Roman Tower, and to ask for a room in the newest Augustus Tower instead. We checked in on Thursday, Feb 5, at around noon, and did not wait in line at all. Walked right up to the desk, handed the super friendly clerk a $20 with my drivers license and credit card and asked to be put in the Augustus Tower, Not only did we get a great room there, but we got one on the side of the Bellagio Fountain - lovely! The bathroom was huge, the linens were nice, and housekeeping gave us loads of extra towels. We spent a morning at the Qua Spa and got massages and facials. Very nice spa area. Massage was pretty good, and facial was fantastic. In the mornings, we went down to the Payard pastry and coffee shop and brought pastries, fresh fruit and coffee back to our room. Perfect, and way cheaper and less time consuming than a sit-down breakfast. We had fabulous meals at Bradley Ogden and Nero's, and a mediocre one at Rao's.Overall a nice hotel, and a very fun experience. Not the Four Seasons Hotel, by any means, but nowhere near the price of the Four Seasons, ether..."
313,303,"Feb 12 2009	Looking a gift (trojan) horse in the mouth.....	Just arrived home after 2 nights at Caesar's with my 21 year old son. My ex-husband (his dad) gifted us with the trip for Christmas complete with Elton John tickets. I usually research a trip to death but Vegas seemed a no-brainer. Caesar's seemed a wonderful choice. I've travelled a lot for business and leisure and well....I'm kind of a hotel snob. So yes, I should have researched and known better than to allow my trip to be marred by a room in the Roman Towers.Check-in took 45 minutes with no apologies at all.Please learn from my mistake and do not accept a room in the Roman Towers. There was no closet, the only place to hang clothes was in the bathroom over the ice bucket and safe. There was no full length mirror. The whole room was dusty and only semi-clean.Housekeeping did not leave clean glasses or pick up dirty room service dishes.And for God's sake, [-] ever happened to a cup of coffee in the morning that doesn't cost 20 bucks???!!!!!!Can't believe they are not embarrassed to put customers in the Roman Towers."
314,303,"Feb 12 2009 	Caesars is an attitude	The place has always had a little Sinatra swagger to it, reminiscent of Vegas in its halcyon days. It used to be unique, but other high-end properties like Mandalay Bay, Wynn, and the Venetian have caught up and even surpass it. She's kind of like Ingrid Bergman or Sophia Loren in their fifties -- still eminently presentable, but her best days are certainly behind her.The rooms are smart, comfortable, and well-appointed, though some of the older ones sport a view so poor, you'll want to keep the drapes closed. If you have a choice, opt for the Palace (first choice) or Augustus (second) Tower.By far the best amenity is still the pool. The drinks are expensive ($17 for a Caesars' Lemonade -- nicely spiked, of course), but you'll want to indulge. Service can be spotty at times -- truth be told, that millstone could be hung around all Harrah's properties -- but it is tends to be better than most. We have our favorite restaurants in Vegas, but it just so happens that none of them happen to be in Caesars, so even though we have stayed there at least a dozen times over the years, we can't express an informed opinion. Their spa and fitness club deserves a major-league demerit. It doesn't come close to measuring up to Mandalay Bay's -- and isn't much better than you find at Harrah's or the Rio -- but they have the audacity to charge for use of the shower facilities, even for their Diamond Club members. &quot;We're Caesars. We're better than you.&quot; The swagger can be endearing up to a point, but borders on the annoying.Caesars has grown almost by accident, and not according to any coherent plan. It has a few annoying quirks, such as a Diamond check-in area in a place where you can no longer drive to; after parking in the valet, you have to walk half-way around the property with luggage in tow. It's not a major concern for the casual traveler, although check-in lines for the average customer can be unduly extreme for a high-end property. Expect a long wait. A stroll through the Forum Shops is a delightful way to return from the Strip, but the only people who shop there have more money than sense. The Fashion Show Mall is just a short walk down the Strip, and a better place to indulge."
315,303,"Feb 10 2009 	On to be caesar	Firstly, can't believe I forgot to write review until now, most have been too busy telling everyone in person that we loved caesars!Stayed for two nights mid-week in November for our first trip to Vegas.Booked through travel agent, who booked through agency etc, so the hotel had problem tracking down our reservation initially. We appreciate these things happen, but the wonderful girl checking us in was very apologetic and got it sorted as quickly as possible. She also arranged an upgrade to the Augustus Towers overlooking the Bellagio Fountains for a knockdown price. The room, as mentioned by other posters is huge and the bathroom larger than many standard hotel rooms. So good we often felt bad for leaving. The rest of the hotel, if you can get around to all of it, is superb, and only regret is that we didn't have more time there."
316,303,"Feb 9 2009 	Inept Management Don't Stay at Caesars	I still find it unbelievable that I, and many others, had to wait over an hour to check in to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on February 4, 2009. Hotel Management didnt really seem to care that the line was extremely long. There was a hotel employee handing out water bottles, but when I asked for a cocktail or glass of wine I was denied. Would it have killed management to have the same employee pushing a cart with beer and wine for people waiting in line? When I finally got to the front of the line there was uncertainty related to whether I was going to get the room that I had a written confirmation for at the agreed upon price. The front desk employee told me that all of the rooms at your price are sold out, as if it was my fault. They asked me to pay extra to get into their next tier room. They still didnt apologize for the hour-long wait. They didnt offer a $50 hospitality credit to be used in a Caesars restaurant or bar for my time waiting in line. They were asking me for more money, which I refused. After a while they then accommodated me in another room, which was a normal room. It was as if Caesars had never checked in a large group of people before. It was amateur hour, and from speaking to other members of my group the line existed all day long. I thought I was in a Seinfeld episode.When the room was cleaned any dirty glasses or dishes were not removed from the room.The pool area was closed for renovation. Upon check out there was a $25 mini bar charge on my bill. I didnt even open the door of the mini bar. As soon as I mentioned this, the charge was removed. Nice try Caesars, but I look at my bill.My advice to meeting planners, no matter where you stay, is to write in to the contract a penalty clause if the wait is over X number of minutes, the hotel owes each guest who waited longer than the agreed upon minutes a certain number of dollars. If the guest gets bumped to another hotel, their stay at the other hotel is free. In the age of computers there is no excuse to overbook a hotel and for there to be extra long check in lines. It is absurd. Caesars has clearly forgotten which industry they are in, its called hospitality. I would not recommend this hotel until it is sold to someone who cares about their guests.John PorrielloWethersfield, CT"
317,303,"Feb 8 2009 	Long lines no coffee and upcharges for even the basics	Stayed Feb 2-6. Hoping for some comfort at a first class hotel after a chaotic day of airports and shuttle busses? Not even close. I arrived to find a line at the check-in that wrapped back and forth thru the lobby then down the hall to the shopping area. Waited over an hour. Velvet ropes were set up to manage the crowd - apparently this is a daily event. No apologies to the guests; no refreshments while waiting; no management to acknowledge that this was apalling for a $250+ per night &quot;first class&quot; hotel. And where was the bell staff to help guests to their rooms?For business travelers here for conferences, not for leisure, the hotel experience falls way short of expectations. Many of the basics that business travelers expect are absent . No newspapers for guest rooms. Internet access is $14.95 for 24 hours. It's $25 a day to use the fitness center. It's $5 for a kiosk to print your boarding pass. Good luck getting a cup of coffee in the morning. There are no in-room coffee machines, no free coffee in the lobby, and the coffee shop didn't open until 7 AM, too late for most conference goers. The only place I could get a cup each morning was in a bar in the casino area for $4 plus tip. When I asked the desk, they suggested that I order coffee via room serivce - but it would cost $11 plus $5 delivery fee plus 18% gratuity plus taxes.Everyone in my conference of 300+ people was buzzing about the check in debacle, and many of them waited the hour in line just to find that the hotel was oversold and they were bumped to another hotel. Even our keynote speaker, an expert on marketing of service businesses, commented about the hotel's shamefully bad customer service. I believe that Caesars Palace was once a fine hotel with a reputation for luxury, but clearly it has lost its way. I would never consider a return visit."
318,303,"Feb 8 2009 	Awesome!	First time in Vegas, and decided to go to a great hotel, and great it was. Upgraded our room on arrival, although it wasn't overlooking the strip completely it was still a great room, probably too big. His and hers bathrooms, but only ever used one of them.Spent our time getting totally lost, makes all your usual holiday hotels seem TINY. Never went back to our room the same way twice!Colloseum shopping centre and all the fabulous eating places out of this world. Went to Bette Midler show, well worth the expense.SO glad we went to this pretigious hotel, although having looked around a lot of the other hotels on the strip too they all seem equally stunning, so would probably try one of those next visit.Loved the relaxed feel of the place, dress how you want, no pressure, but that applies to all Vegas.Can't think of anything negative to say (which is a first!), would recommend this to everyone."
319,303,"Feb 7 2009 	Love Being Bumped 	AVOID LAS VEGAS and especially Caesar's. They make you waiti in long lines to check in and you are at risk of being &quot;bumped&quot; to another hotel as I was. Even though the hotel to which I was bumped was close by and to a suite, which they comped - I was informed that I would &quot;have no choice&quot;. Now I was at this hotel as a speaker at a conference to be held there so I really didn't want to go. And with a sprained ankle and a heavy roller bag, getting to the Flamingo (and it was only across the street) was pure hell. And when I got to the Flamingo, another 40 minute wait to check in. At least they were nice about it. Anyway I didn't make it to any of the other presentations at the conference because of my Nomadic experience. Really hacked off!!! PS : NOTHING is free; they don't even put wine openers in the room and internet is $13.95. It will be a long time before I endure the waits and crowds at the airport and the indifferent treatment of the hotel staff at Caesar's again."
320,303,"Feb 7 2009 	Excellent Location on the Strip	This was my second trip to Vegas and went with a small group of friends. We picked Caesar's because of the location on the strip (right in the center).We arrived late in the evening (8:30 PM), but there was no line at the check-in counter and they gave us a free upgrade without asking to the Augustus tower which is one of the newer towers on the south end of the property (closest to check-in counter) when we had booked a Forum tower. The room was a nice upgrade and we had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains.The room was great, can't complain at all.The Casino is probably my favorite one in all of Vegas, though my only complaint is that the Poker Room is an 'after though' with a separate maze to go thru to get to it.The food court in the Casino is a bit overpriced, but a better option then nothing at all. And the casino waitresses bring drinks by regularly.Pure is by the Poker Room and is the most happening club in Vegas, so that was a plus.Pool was above average, but nothing great. They only had one open at that time of year, so I'm sure it's better in the summer. I'm going again this May so will find out then."
321,303,"Feb 4 2009	Not Worth The Money 	I stayed in the hotel from Jan. 29-Feb. 1, 2009. This trip was meant to be a friend's birthday weekend celebration that we planned for months. One of the friends that came on the trip was stuck to a wheechair due to a leg injury a few weeks before. Our flight coming in arrived at 8:00am so we went to the hotel and tried to check in early. The line up was very long, but we did come early and a lot of people were checking out so that did not bother me too much. After about 20 minutes it was out turn and we asked if it was possible to check in early. They said that they would accomodate us for an early check in, and came up with 3 rooms on the same floor in the Roman Tower. I asked if there were any rooms available for an upgrade, and the lady said that they were full capacity due to the Super Bowl Weekend. We made our way to the Roman Tower and were disappointed from the time we stepped off the elevators. The hallways were very outdated, there was garbage everywhere, there was a glass in every single corner of the hallway and not to mention it smelled of mold. Our rooms were nothing short of a motel! The bedrooms had no closets, the bathroom door was glass as was the wall that looked into the bedroom, so if you took a bath or a shower, who ever is in the living room can see you. We were a little disappointed but kind of debated whether to say anything, we figured we would not spend too much time in the rooms. The only other issue was that getting around in a wheelchair was almost impossible because the hallways were tiny. We decided not to say anything and were tired from being up at 3am having to make our flight that morning. Within 30 minutes we realized that there was no way we were staying in those rooms. The floors were not vacuumed as there were sunflower seeds and chips on the floor. The bathroom had not been cleaned and had soap residue on the tub as well as the sink. There was garbage on the bathroom floor and the garbage cans were not emptied. One of the rooms had (I assume by the looks of it) pubic hair in the bathtub. The ceilings and walls were mirrored, and there was a thick layer of dust on everything in the room. We immediately got on the phone, complained about everything and were told that we had to wait until noon. During that time we went for some lunch in the food court and waited for the managers. They upgraded us to the Palace Tower which was a deluxe room, very nice looking and definitely clean! The only problem was that the Tower was on the whole other side of the hotel, and had to wheelchair her through the entire hotel and casino. We took it as it is and were extremely happy with the new accomodations. But only for a short while... Their housekeepers clean rooms starting between 7am-8am, every morning. They do not care if the DO NOT DISTURB sign is hung, they will still knock. Every morning I would open the door and say, please come back after 10, and they would knock half an hour later. At check out, we had not only been charged things that we did not even touch or were not there when we checked in, but they cut off our room keys hours before our check out time. Their staff is so slow and although they are semi friendly, they are not fit to run a hotel of that size with the attitude of &quot;There is nothing we can do&quot;. I would advise to stay at the Caesar's Palace and only to the Palace or Augustus Tower if the prices are unbeatable. There are way cheaper hotels for the same location such as Bally's, Imperial Palace, and Flamingo, so why over pay if you are getting the same service as a lower grade accomodation."
322,303,"Feb 3 2009 	Hotel ok...Augustus restaurant made us sick	We stayed over Super Bowl weekend. Room was not ready and we were told to return in 20 minutes. We were already given keys but they didn't work after returning 45 minutes later. Otherwise, the room was fine...beautiful roomy bathroom, excellent room service waiter. Maid service was extremely slow and we had to go to the maid for towels on the 2nd day as we were back in our room by 1pm and not cleaned. As for the gaming with it being a Super Bowl weekend the table limits were way too high so we spent most of our gaming time at Harrahs. The worst was dining for breakfast the day we left in the Augustus coffee shop. Both of us got sick. I nearly passed out waiting to get on the plane, paramedics were called and was therefore not allowed to board. Had to take a later flight which cast a shadow on the whole trip."
323,303,"Feb 2 2009 	Roman Tower = Motel 6 with a Casino!	I thought the reviews of the Roman Tower must be exaggerated -- but I was wrong! I was part of a conference -- and paid more than $200 a night, and I travel frequently, so I had some concept of what $200 usually gets! Wrong! My room did not have a closet -- really. In the bathroom, there was a rack between the tub and the wall for my clothes, a la Motel 6. The safe was in the floor, and the glasses and ice bucket were on the safe -- so when I hung up my clothes, they hung down over the ice bucket and glasses!Amusing, huh? But I could live with that. That night when I took my shower, I pulled out the shower curtain -- the bottom was yellow and spotted with mildew stains -- a lovely contrast to the bright white of the rest of the curtain. Kind of disgusting, but it was bed time, so I just made it quick!Went over to turn on the bedside lamp -- no working light bulb. But it's bedtime, and I can't deal with changing rooms. So I call and leave a message asking for the lightbulbs to be replaced and the shower curtain to be replaced the next day. Of course, there's nothing that can be done about the huge gaping pull in the carpet, except maybe cover it with duct tape --- which would be a cosmetic improvement!At lunch, I came back to the room to work on my computer -- this is a business trip after all -- and guess what -- there were NO outlets anywhere near the desk. That was the last straw. So, I call down and ask for a new room. They are very gracious and assign me a new room in the Roman Tower -- I go down, get the new key, and check out the room before I move -- which does have a closet! But again -- No outlets by the desk. The only outlet on that side of the room is behind the armoire containing the TV. I go down again, and the young woman is very gracious and gives me an upgrade &quot;at no cost, since I've had so much trouble&quot;. I go check out my new room in the Palace Tower, which is very nice -- complete with outlets by the desk so you can plug in your computer and Blackberry!I go back to my room to move my stuff -- I didn't want to wait for the bellman -- packed it all up, got back to the new room, and the key didn't work! The same key that had just worked! I had two keys, and neither worked. Housekeeping will not let you in and told me to call security, who had no idea when they could be there, and said it would be quicker for me to go back to the front desk. So, I trudged back down, the same very nice young woman ask how I'd demagnetized my keys -- no idea how I could have done that in 15 minutes -- but she redid them and sent me on my way! Finally! So -- only stay there if you are guarenteed that you are NOT in the Roman Tower! They should be embarrased to send guests there -- another woman told me there was no door on her bathroom! It is truly not an exaggeration to say that the Roman Tower is like staying in the Motel 6 with a casino! But if you are in any other other Towers, I think you would find them to be very nice and very much what you expect for a resort hotel or a conference hotel."
324,303,"Jan 30 2009 	Had a Fantastic Time at Caesars	We stayed at Caesars from 1/22 - 1/23. We were booked either the Palace or Augustus tower deluxe, could not choose, based on availability. Got in at early at 1:30 pm and checked in although confirmation letter adamantly said 4 pm or after. There was absolutely no waiting in line and when we discovered we were booked into the Palace, we just asked if there were any rooms available in the Augustus, overlooking the Bellagio fountains and possibly adjoining. We shot for the moon. The clerk checked and said no problem. With no extra money nor tipping necessary, we got two adjoining rooms with two queen beds each on the 38th floor, overlooking the fountains and strip headon. Gorgeous! The rooms were spacious, clean and well appointed; the beds and linen luxurious and the bathrooms outstanding. Just loved the flat screen tv in the gleaming bathroom. Maid service was prompt and wonderful. Ate at the Augustus cafe in their banquet room and it was very, very good for our large group. Bette Midler was fantastic. Casino very smokey and there was a funny oder by the Roman tower entrance. I think it was from the proximity of the chocolate shop nearby and mixing with the smokey air. Weird smell. Loved our stay. Staff professional, excellent and attentive."
325,303,"Jan 29 2009 	How much was that room????	When we arrived to checkin at Caesar's Palace, there was a long line of people ahead of us. We couldn't figure out why the line was moving so slow until it was our turn at the front desk.We had booked an incredible deal for the room rate on the hotel's website. But the person at the reception desk seemed determined to make us spend more.He pulled out a book and started trying to talk us into different rooms. After flying for about 6 hours, we weren't really in the mood for this, but he was persistent.He finally showed us a room and said we could have it for $30.00. Of course, that sounded ridiculous, but I kept asking him over and over again and he kept saying $30.00.During our stay, I tried to check the room rate on the customer service channel and it never showed up.But when we checked out, we realized that they had charged us an &quot;upcharge&quot; of $30 per night for the room we stayed in.Two more things. Although listed as an amenity on the website, there is a charge of $14.99 a day for wireless internet. AND we were charged a room service charge for several items from the room that we did not use. (The customer support people on the phone were very cooperative about refunding us the money for the room service items).Was the room worth the money? Other than the fact that the shower didn't drain and we were standing in ankle deep water every time we showered, it was a pretty nice room. However, I doubt that it was really any nicer than the original room that we had booked over the internet."
326,303,"Jan 28 2009 	awesome hotel!	what a fantastic hotel! cant praise it enough....we stayed for week, wish it could have been longer, the room was amazing, huge bed massive bathroom (tv in the mirror etc) very plush, and to top it off we had direct views over the bellagio water fountains!!so if you book there make sure you ask for the augustus tower, as thats the newest one with all the amazing views of the fountain and strip..its a very plush hotel but not at all snotty, which is a bonus. the decor is great it all looks fresh, the food was fantastic, portions are huge, casino is awesome..i cant say enough nice things about it, staff are very helpful and there is every facility available that you could need!"
327,303,"Jan 26 2009 	Caesars was nice but will stay somewhere else next trip	My husband I went to Las Vegas October 1-5th 2007. We stayed all four nights at Caesars Palace in the new Augustus Tower. This section was very close to the main lobby and very easy to get to.Our room was beautiful and had a nice view of the strip. We could see the pool when looking to left out of our window. We ate at Rao's our first evening there, the restaurant was vey busy so we sat at the Bar and had a wonderful dinner. The bartender was excellent and very helpful with our ordering. We had breakfast one morning at the Payard Bistro. My husband and I both had chocolate and banana waffle. These waffles were soggy and dripping with chocolate. I do not recommend this Bistro to anyone. Menu very limited and expensive. We had a quick bite to eat at the Augustus Cafe located right next to the lobby. Very good burgers and appetizers at a good price. The pool at Caesars was a big disappointment. They are adding on to the hotel so they have barrier walls set up around the pool. In fact it seems the new addition is going to be blocking the sun from the pools. The pool does not see good sunlight until 1pm or so. We gambled at Caesars a few nights, the hotel is huge so it didn't seem overcrowded. Overall the hotel was nice, nice and bright, and friendly staff."
328,303,"Jan 26 2009 	Forget Hail Caesar I suggest hailing a cab elsewhere	I was at Casears for 4 days over New Years. I have stayed here before so I knew there is a MAJOR difference between their newer towers and their old towers in terms of rooms. The old tower is like a Holiday inn from the 1980's. Basic bed, stanky smell from years of smoking, even if you get a non-smoking room, etc..I had booked a room in the newer tower upfront. When I checked in, there was no room available where I had booked AND prepaid. So, they said they would only charge me the going rate for the old tower they were putting me in. Say what? Are you kidding with me? ONly charge me for what you are providing even though what your providing isn't what I booked and prepaid for?They agreed to switch my room the next day. It gets better, they move me into a new room and when I get there someone else is in inside! I kid you not.I would NEVER stay here again. Go to Bellagio, Wynn, Encore, even the Venetian for a high end strip hotel. But I'd avoid Casears. If you do stay here don't say I didn't warn you.Upside is easy access to shopping."
329,303,"Jan 21 2009 	Nice if you get the right room.	A friend of mine checked in the day before me. He requested, and received without a problem, an upgrade to a nice, new room. When I showed up the next day, I asked for the same thing, and they refused to even look if anything was available unless I paid more. (I was already paying $210 per night, which is clearly not a rock bottom price).They put me in the Roman Tower. An old tower which an employee told was supposed to be subject to EXTENSIVE renovations, but they put it on hold because of the economy. In the meantime, it's smelly and tired. (IMPORTANT TIP: When you check in avoid letting them put you in the Roman Tower).After a couple of days in the Roman Tower, I got a call from the front desk telling me that there was apparently a leak in my room, affecting the room below me, and that I was gonig to have to move. I was then moved to the Palace Tower; a tower which has been renovated. Much better. Friends of mine told me that Augustus Tower is even better.It's probably typical everywhere in Vegas, but I don't like the fact that they don't have coffee makers in the room or an affordable place to get a quick snack. The breakfast buffet (which was impressive indeed) was $25. I ate way too much to justify the fact that I was spending so much on breakfast. The next morning, even a bran muffin and a glass of orange juice was over $10.If you want to live it up big and are willing to pay the price to do so, this is a good spot. The shops in the Forum are all ultra high end, as are most of the restaurants.As long as your expectations are for the high end and can avoid the Roman Tower, you should enjoy yourself."
330,303,"Jan 14 2009 	1st Trip To Vegas	My wife and I stayed at Caesar's from Jan. 10th Sat. until Jan. 13th Tuesday. We arrived approximately 4 hours early for check-in, but that seemed to be no problem. We received a free room upgrade(Forum Towers) and had no problems at all. The casino offered us $20.00 each in restuarant comps for signing up for total rewards. We decided to visit/gamble at several of the other casinos and found Caesar's to be in at least the top 3, if not the best. I recommend that staying at Caesar's should be top priority while in Vegas. I also forgot to mention that we arrived at Caesar's on Saturday and that we booked our entire trip on Friday. I could not have been more pleased that a trip planned a few hours before arrival went this well.Side notes: Casino- had fun, loved the wheel of fortune machines, but lost about $2,600.Restaurants- worst part about Caesar's, overpriced and bad food.Hotel Room- top notch. No other way to explain it.Hotel Staff- excellent, very friendly"
1,305,Nov 19 2009 	Home away from home	Stayed at the Cancun for 3 days as the kids were nagging us to see Hoover Dam. Was surprised of the quality of the rooms. When I booked the room through hotels.com it stated that the room would sleep five when in actually it only sleeps 4 noting one room has a king size bed and a queen bed with no sleeper sofer. The room was clean and modern with huge spa baths adjoined to each room. My biggest gripe was that there was no free wireless internet and was expensive at $9.95 per day. Great pool facility with waterslide for the kids. Beds were clean and comfortable with each room having a tv which was good for the kids. Free Shuttle bus to the strip was also very handy. Would stay here again. Staff were very courteous and frendly.
2,305,"Nov 17 2009 	a pleasent stay at Cancun Resort ( a time share)	my husband and i checked in on a tuesday evening- the room was nice- king sized bed and tv in bedroom / a couch that pulls out and a chair and tv in livingroom- a dinning table for 4 &amp; a full kitchen- stove, dishwasher, microwave, full size fridge. we had two bathrooms- one off the livingroom- with a stand up shower and sink and toilet- the bigger bathroom was off the bedroom it had a two sinks, toilet and huge jetted tub for 2. everything was clean and tiddy except the carpet had stains in more than a few places throughout the villa. It was too cold to swim when we were there - but the pool looked beautiful from our balcony.i do have a suggestion for any single travelers- i would request to be in the main building - no one is at the doors in the parking garadges and we had a problem with a man pulling the door out of our hands cause he didn't have a room key and then proceeded to yell and act beligerant! security was called and never came- i went the next morning to complain that no one even took a reoport about this&lt;Security was a joke- they didn't seam at all concerned and said i could fill out a report if i wanted to.this was free to us --as sister used her points- they tried to get us to listen to the time share pitch- but we declined!!!! sister joined us for a few days- she wasn't pleased with a few things as well. over all - a clean decent place to stay- way too far from all the fun. if you want it quiet and away from the action- then this is the place- but you couldn't pay me to stay there if i didn't have a rental car. the shuttle is a joke AND stops at midnight- and a cab four miles from mandalay bay- is Ridiculous!!!also they require a $100 deposit for god only knows what!"
3,305,"Nov 16 2009 	A Home away from home!!!	Beautiful Resort to stay in!! I really felt as if i was in CanCun, the pool is huge &amp; so nice, My room was almost the size of my house. I love the Comfortable bed, huge bathroom, very nicely decorated, calm/relaxing environment, &amp; excellent price. Absolutely loved it &amp; will definitly stay there again!!"
4,305,"Nov 8 2009 	Great Place to Stay	Stayed at this hotel fo 2 days and had a great experience. The staff was friendly and helpful all around. The room was in great shape, clean and comfortable and spacious with a view of The Las Vegas Strip (albeit off in the distance)The location about 3 miles from the Stirp was great for my family away from the hustle of LV. Restaurants, shopping (Oulet Mall and Groceries) close . Courtesy shuffle to The Strip was convenientThe resort is themed like a Mexican Resort and was impressive.Parking garage was locked at night and felt very secureFree internet would have been a bonus. Wireless is available but cost of $9.95 per 24 hrsIf you are looking for a comfortable place to stay in Vegas THIS IS THE PLACE"
5,305,"Oct 28 2009 	Great Resort	We had a two bedroom two bath suite. This was fabulous for us - had a balcony, full kitchen, etc. Parking was a little difficult for those renting vehicles. The rooms are comfortable, well appointed. If you are looking for luxury and on the strip this is not it. It is up the strip a little away from the hussle and bussle. We did have a few issues with our room, but maintenance took care of it nearly immediately. Kitchen was a bit small but this suited what we wanted. A fabulous pool, some relaxation and close enough to the strip. You have to get to the pool early if you want a floaty - or cut a deal with someone to have theirs when they are done. Noodles are a plenty also. They have waterslides, pleasant music near the pool - did I mention the pool is spectacularly clean!! Great place for friends getaway, family trip, etc."
6,305,"Oct 24 2009 	So glad we didn't stay on the strip lovely rooms great pool	After seeing the hotels with casinos on the strip and the amount of walking and vast lobbies we were so glad we stayed at the Cancun, which was so quiet, with lovely rooms a fantastic pool and parking convenient to each room. We liked it so much we returned for another 4 nights later in our holiday. The staff were friendly, the room was delightful and the beds comfortable. We had a small apartment (termed a villa), We had a central dining area with small kitchenette off. The small lounge area had a very comfy fold out queen bed for our son and he had his own bathroom whilst next door we had a nice spacious feeling master bedroom with a huge his and hers bathroom with ample spa bath. All in all we felt it a home from home and a retreat from a trip to the strip! We used the shuttle and also drove our car into the strip using I15 and found it easy to park in the casino parking. Across the road from the hotel is a good selection of eating places - much cheaper than the strip, plus a useful food store, gas station and pharmacy -- everything you could need. Recommend Outback Steakhouse, and IHOP for breakfast."
7,305,"Oct 14 2009 	Not too bad...........	Before we went to the Cancun resort we read here how unfriendly the staff was, we didn't run into that at all. They were courteous and helpful at check in and assisted us with printing our boarding passes before we left. The condos themselves, at least the two bedroom we had, are smaller than the other condos where we have stayed. It was very clean though and quiet. But then this is Vegas and how much time are you going to be at your condo. The pool was absolutely beautiful but we couldn't figure out while the temperatures were in the mid 90's to low 100's the water felt as if it were about 60 degrees. We were not the only ones that thought the water was too cold. A couple of nights we did hear a few people that had been celebrating a little too much as they returned but only lasted a couple of minutes, and not that long after we returned for the evening. The resort is less than 10 minutes from the strip, we didn't use the shuttle at all and found that if you use back streets you can get to some of the parking decks at the casinos without having to deal with all the traffic of the strip. If you want to get away from all the glitz and glamour of the strip take a trip up to Freemont Street. Its old Vegas and is much more laid back than the strip and found it to be a pleasant change. Overall it is a nice resort and would return here again if we ever travel to Vegas again."
8,305,"Sep 30 2009 	Very nice resort	My husband and I went to this resort last week-9/25. We booked a room through our timeshare and also got one for two of our friends. The rooms were spectacular and the beds were even better! All four of us raved about the beds. The rooms each had kitchens, 2 bathrooms, and the living room can be closed off to make a second bedroom. The pool was great too, although we were so busy we barely spent any time in it, except to try out the waterslides, which were awesome. The only downfall is that the hotel is about 3 miles from the strip. they advertise a shuttle, but it is VERY unreliable, and it only runs from 12-12. I would just rent a car next time. I will definately be back to the CANCUN RESORT!!!"
9,305,"Sep 17 2009 	Nice resort	We were in Vegas for my daughter's wedding the week of 9/6-9/13. I own a timeshare at Polo Towers but since they were full for the time I needed, I was able to exchange a banked week for my Mom and two brothers for the Cancun resort.While it quite a ways from the strip, it worked for us since I rented a car for the week. I don't know how people do it otherwise!We got a two bedroom, two bath unit on the 5th floor. Love the unit and the view of the mountains. Very happy with the resort all in all.We spent more time at the pool than I thought we would. The drinks were not too expensive considering what they charge on the strip. One vodka tonic was $5.50, but I WAS charged a $3.00 &quot;up charge&quot;. What the heck?The restaurant food needs revamping, in a big way. They are seriously missing a great opportunity here. Someone from this resport should spend a few day in Mexico and see how they treat their guests and what kind of food/drinks they are serving. My goodness....It would be great to have fish taco's, tropical salads, fresh fruit &amp; cheese platters offered to guests as they lounge around the pool. Why isn't anyone walking around the pool offering guests signature drinks. Lovely tropical drinks would be delightful. Instead, they had bar food fare; wings, french fries, nachos. The only thing I could find on the menu that wasn't fried was a turkey sandwich, and it was good.We own three timeshares and are able to move them (exchange) to various places all the time. Never ever have we been charged anything anywhere we have stayed. Only this resort charged us a $6.93 daily &quot;Accommodation Tax&quot;. Weird.To leave this review on a possitive note, the property and the unit was very clean and spacious. Yes, the kitchen is rather small, but still functional."
10,305,"Sep 3 2009 	Clean resort but would rather be closer to strip.	We purchased the timeshare from a friend who very nicely traded her timeshare in New Hampshire for the one at Cancun Resort. None of us had ever stayed here before, and were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness and look of the hotel. We also liked the rooms and our view of the strip. However, if you are not traveling with kids, this may not be the place for you. Lots of rules, like only 1 float per room (there were 4 adults in our room), having to show ID to get horseshoe stuff. You are also charged $30 per week for wifi, which was unexpected. The biggest negative for us, however, was that the shuttle to the strip only ran from 12pm to 12am, so the free shuttle wasn't exactly operating at prime times. In the future, I would stay on the strip, even if I had to pay extra."
11,305,"Aug 23 2009 	Great resort near the Las Vegas Strip!	Stayed the weekend here at the Cancun Resort before school started for the kids. There is nothing bad you can say about the hotel itself. The one bedroom villa was very clean (except for the fact that there was a couple of sunflower seeds near the balcony), pool area is very nice, and open amenities and lobby are nicely put together and clean. The only problem is that the pool staff later at night were not very friendly. Seeing as how it was almost 10pm closing maybe they just wanted to go home. Housekeeping staff were also a little loud while in the elevator with them, and one housekeeper was painting her nails in the elevator! Another problem that I found at the resort is that it is not very kid friendly. The Caribe Lounge did not except minors into the restaurant so we couldn't eat their and were told to eat somewhere else. Also there was no free internet which was a big dissapointment! *** Big thank you to Michael at the Concierge desk! By attending the owners meeting we were given 4 complementary tickets to Steve Wyrick's magic show which was a fabulous show. We were given great seats and moved up toward the front a little too!Will stay again!"
12,305,"Aug 17 2009 	Incredible pool terrific rooms nice facilities	We planned to stay only two nights but enjoyed this hotel so much my wife and I called-in-sick to work to stay an extra night! We had a 1-bedroom unit. It was in excellent condition (new), nice furniture, well-stocked kitchen, large master bath, very very clean. The whole place smells good (which is important if you ever stayed in a place that smells funky).Our favorite part of the hotel was the pools. The pools themselves are large, complete with a waterfall you can swim under and waterslides. We especially appreciated the numerous lifeguards on duty who keep the kids from getting too crazy and keep everyone safe. There's also a very nice gameroom with 4 pool tables, some kids games, and an activity daycare center for kids.Close to restaurants, CVS pharmacy but a few miles from the strip so it's nice and quiet.The only bad thing about the stay was being asked to attend a timeshare presentation.We'll return to this hotel!P.S. Check out the Pinhall Hall of Fame in Vegas if you're into pinball! All the vintage machines are there and you play them for a quarter!"
13,305,"Aug 10 2009 	Excellent mini vacation	The resort is excellent, with only one negative comment which I will address first. They offer a complimentary shuttle to the strip. Hours of operation is good, but the van is to small considering the # of owners and guest that use the service. Plus vans are up in age and should be replace with buses. We stayed in the penthouse, which speaks for itself, we have taken our grand kids on several occasions, and the first thing they want to do is rant and rave to their parents about how good the activities and wonderful the big rooms. The staff and housekeepingwas much more than I expected. Did not see any sales staff, which was a real plus this time. The grounds of the resort are well maintained. Would highly recommend this resort, and would come back here again and again."
14,305,"Jun 30 2009 	unfriendly front desk personnel	We are owners at this place so when we got there, the (obnoxious) front desk people told us that our rooms weren't ready. (check in is at 4:00 and it was past , close to 5:00) the lady did not apologized and did not care to please us in any way. So we waited over two hours...We asked for a key to the pool (at least the kids could get wet while we waited) They finally gave us one of the rooms, except the penthouse and the other room, so when they finally informed us that the room was ready, i went to get the key. The lady wanted to see an i.d. ( are you serious?) did not bring one with me it was in the car... She refused to give me the key. After the two hours, you'd think they'd be more friendly, at at least understanding...Nope, i asked to speak to a supervisor, and he too was an a...hole. After what it seemed an eternity, he asked for several personal information and reluctantly gave me the keys...the next day i needed to print something out from the place they have and on the computer it said i needed to buy a card from the front desk... so here we go again... all i needed to know was the minimum of minutes i needed to buy to use the internet okay? So one of the clerks is on the phone and I stood in front of her to ask her the question-nothing. A gentleman came over and called the next person in line, I approached him and said, &quot;i just have a quick question&quot; and he said &quot; There is a line&quot; . Yes, there was a line, but they all had cards, as if they were ready to check out. I left."
15,305,Jun 28 2009 	Wished it was closer to the Strip	We exchanged one of our timeshare weeks for this resort. Rooms are great though kitchen is a little small. Very clean and bed was very comfortable. TVs in main room and bedroom are kind of small. I needed internet which you have to pay $ 30.00 per week for. The pool was great and water very refreshing after laying in hot sun. Our kids (tweens) only used the water slides once which surpised me. At the towel hut you can check out a float for the pool at no cost which is nice. Lounge chairs under the umbrellas or palms trees are in high demand. We had an &quot;owner&quot; accuse us of moving his towels from the lounges after we had been sitting there for over 1 1/2 hours. I guess owners/guests rush down at 8:00 am and put towels on the lounges they want to &quot;reserve&quot; and then come down whenever they want to. We hadn't moved his towels but offered to move down but he turned really ugly and thank goodness he decided to move somewhere else. Later his wife walked by and made a snide comment to my husband in front of our kids. That experience really turned us off. We have never encountered someone like that on vacation. My husband and kids ate at the restaurant and said it was &quot;okay&quot; but overpriced. I thought we would utilize the kitchen but other than using the refrigerator for leftovers and making toast a few morning we didn't use the kitchen. We didn't use the shuttle because we like to be able to come and go as we please. Normally we stay in a hotel on the strip but decided to try a timeshare away from the strip. It didn't work for us. The kids really like being on the strip and because hotel rooms are so reasonable next time we will just stay on the strip. There were a lot of families with small children and I think this resort works great for them.
16,305,"Jun 24 2009 	Good Stay	I recently returned from a trip to Las Vegas and my husband and I stayed at the Cancun Resort. Let me start with the grounds. It's a beautiful hotel and a very nice layout. It's located about 3.5 miles south of the strip and there is a shuttle that will take you to the Tropicana and back, but that ends at 12midnight. There was only one shuttle running and sometimes depending on traffic it was better to drive down yourself. If this is an issue I recommend you not stay here.  Our room was wonderful. The apholstery is a little outdated but we don't go to stay in the room so I don't worry too much. There was a kitchen, stove and all the necesities for those that want to eat in to save money. There are two bathrooms, and a whirlpool tub in the master bathroom. DON'T expepect housekeeping to come in every day. I didn't realize that when we booked but since we didn't need much we didn't really care. It's in their manual but I had overlooked it-no big deal to us. The pool is awesome and a great place to hang out for the day. Get there early if you want a great spot but there were plenty of lounge chairs during our visit. We visited the lounge and the food is ok for the price. The cafe was closed when we wanted to visit for breakfast but they recomended the lounge so that's where we ate. We were not harrased by the timeshare people. I didn't even see anyone there-however they are all over on the strip. Overall a great stay would do it again-next time we're bringing the kids."
17,305,"Jun 9 2009 	Very nice stay	Our stay was arranged by friends who own the time share. We were checked in efficiently by the friendly staff and were surprised to find that our friends were kind enough to book us a penthouse! It was large and top-notch, very clean (spotless, in fact except for the coffee maker which still had a used filter in it - okay, that's a small thing and easy to overlook). Most importantly, the beds were very comfortable and the place was dead quiet, probably the quietest hotel room I ever stayed in -- and that is saying something! That's mainly because you can't slam a door if you wanted - they have a mechanism that doesn't allow the door to slam. Now why don't ALL hotels have that!!!The pool was beautiful and perfect for swimming. We loved going under the waterfall and I even went on the water slides and I am not exactly a spring chicken.We didn't eat there, so I can't comment on the food or the room service. And since we didn't pay ourselves, I have to skip the &quot;value' rating.I really can't fault anything except the location because it is 2 miles south of Mandalay Bay, but it is normally a quick drive on the expressway to where the action is, and it has a very convenient exit at Blue Diamond Road."
18,305,"Jun 7 2009 	Shouldn't you get BETTER service than the average hotel if you pay 10k?	Overall I was fairly disappointed in the Cancun resort. There were a few positive things I can say but they were mostly overshadowed by the poor attitude of the front desk staff.PROS:Location - Close to the strip but far enough away that it's not so busy and loudPool - Beautiful pool area. We didn't utilize it while we were there but it was obviously popular.Room Service - I was very pleased by how affordable this option was and the two times we did order it the food arrived in a very timely manner. Shuttle Hours - Your in Las Vegas .. the strip is why many, many people come - your shuttle should run past 12AM. It would also be nice if they had 1-2 more stops. Perhaps one in the middle or one at the other end of the strip. It's quite a hike in the midday heat.Bathrooms - We liked that our room had 2 bathrooms. One in the Master Bedroom with a shower over a jacuzzi tub, and another off of the living room with just a shower. It makes it great if your traveling with friends you don't want coming through your bedroom in the middle of the night to go to the restroom.CONS:Staff - The staff in general was my biggest complaint. I work for Marriott and in the hospitality industry so I know what I'm looking for service wise - this staff didn't have it. Half the time they passed us off to the concierge who then told us to go ask the front desk. The morning before we left I had 2-3 things to ask the desk agent. Between each of the items (may I have an envelope, may I buy a stamp, can you make this and my Netflix please) the agent left me and went behind a door to continue her conversation with another staff member. The only POSITIVE staff I had interation with was the shuttle staff.Shuttle - It was a good to have the option but could be improved.Room - Kitchen should be larger. Compared to the kitchen at our home resort in Lake Tahoe it was like cooking in a closet.Housekeeping - On the day they were to service our room they knocked, we answered and asked them to return in 5 minutes so we could put on shoes etc. etc to go out while she cleaned. She said ok but when we returned after driving around for 1 1/2 hours our room still wasn't cleaned. I called the housekeeping manager and explained and told them to forget servicing the room as we were checking out 2 days early. 5 minutes later the girl arrived with her cart again to clean the room.We are returning to Vegas in March of 2010 for my 30th birthday but I'll pay to stay on the Strip instead of wasting another timeshare week. One would think that you would get BETTER service than the average hotel considering what you fork over to purchase a timeshare."
19,305,"Jun 1 2009 	Worst hotel experience of my life! If I could give it a negative number I would!	Let me just start by saying this trip was supposed to be one to celebrate my husbands birthday (last year he was serving in Iraq for his birthday), a getaway to make up for the honeymoon we never got and a time to meet up with my extended family (including my brother who left to deploy the day after we got back). We were very much looking forward to this trip. We were staying in a two bedroom with a pullout couch with a total of three couples arriving at three different times. Arrangements had been made by my cousin (the timeshare holder) for this resort to be in my name so we could check in a day earlier than she and her spouse. Upon arrival, the hotel could not find our reservation. It took them 30 mins and lots of us and them calling around to find it. Once they finally did we were let into our room. After running around and finally getting settled in my husband and I decided to sit down and have a nice quiet night and watch a movie. We first noticed buttons were missing off the actual tv but didn't think much of it. But then when I went to pick up the remote, the batteries flew across the room because there was no back on it! I decided it wasn't that big of a deal and went on. We then proceeded to try to watch a movie only to find the dvd player was broken and making a huge loud popping noise. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. It took him running back and forth to find a new dvd player and an hour to hook it up. The next morning my husband opened the dresser to put our clothes away only to have our dresser fall apart! We again called front desk and they sent maint again. After trying for a while to fix it then leaving and coming back he decided he couldn't fix it and had to find another one.The first morning after my cousin arrived, she woke to roll over and find a pair of mens underwear that did not belong to anyone in our party! We immediately called the housekeeping to notify of her findings only to have them tell her they must belong to her husband! She then hung up and called the front desk to complain of all the issues building up and also to let them know of the panels that are coming off the wall near the balcony of our wonderful view of the parking lot. They said it being memorial day weekend they could only move us to another room and have no other sister hotels to send us to or rooms to upgrade us to. We had to then pack up all of our belongings and groceries we had bought for a week and move everything to a completely different building. The hotel did not even offer to help! They only thing they could do to make up for it was a dinner off site (we refused to eat at their horrible restaurant). Which when it came time for us to get our vouchers and go to dinner they were not at the front desk. So they had to track down the GM to get them. All the while we missed the shuttle and had to pay for a taxi! We also had her comp us a few drinks at the pool but she was not happy about having to do both. Our room had two bathrooms, so one bathroom was shared by four people. Knowing this, housekeeping still only gave us enough towels for two people. The bedrooms do not have any fans and the air barely worked in our room so my husband and I sweat it out every night. We had the ac on the lowest it would go but still nothing! After sleeping in our new bed my husband and I both noticed we were itchy. We didn't think much of it until after the next night when we were both bright red and covered in hives. We had welts all over our bodies that itched like crazy! I called to the front desk and they said we must just be allergic to their detergant and that it wouldn't help to get new sheets. It did not seem very likely to us that we were both allergic to the same detergant and that we were fine in the first room but not his one! I told her to send the sheets anyways. When we got home we noticed they brought new sheets but rather than put them on they just left them on the table near the door! After we put the new sheets on the day we left we finally started to get better. The shuttle was nice to have but only runs until midnight. So you do not get a ride home if you plan on going home late. All the drivers had different rules and if there were a lot of people waiting you had to wait for the next time which could be an hour. A taxi back to the hotel is a minimum of $20 but will often run you double that with the traffic. We had to use the taxi more often then planned because they had one shuttle broke down so rather than the 15 min wait time they advertise, you wait more like 30. I will say that they nicest people we came across were two of the shuttle drivers. The restaurant at the pool is awful. They are incredibly overpriced. The chicken wings were very over priced and I must say the worst I've ever had. The frozen margaritas out of the machine were great though. But did cost you $12. The pool is large and has water slides but it got extremely crowded on the weekend. There were not enough chairs for people, but plenty of room where they could have bought them. I guess the hotel was too cheap for that. We had six people in our room but were only allowed to check out one pool float per room! They had a cookout for the weekend that we decided to purchse food from. We went to the food only to find you must go to the restaurant on the other side of the pool area to stand in line to purchase tickets then come back to the food to stand in line to get your food! We did this and when it was our turn to get our food they ran out!! They were not sure if they would get anymore, but finally came up with some 30 minutes later. The only reason we were able to get food was because we happened to walk up and check to see if any was there right before it had once again run out. The organization and planning of this hotel is a disgrace. After staying at this hotel I will NEVER purchase a timeshare. I will NEVER EVER recommend this hotel to ANYONE! This is the worst hotel on the market. I am highly disappointed. Especially after reading so many great reviews. I could go on and on about how much this hotel ruined our trip but I will stop. I think you get the point. It was awful and completely ruined our trip. Oh and my husband and I just finally got our hives, redness and severe itching to go away today...one week after being home! DO NOT stay here!!!!!"
20,305,May 30 2009 	Lock your valuables in the safe	I had a bad experience staying at the Cancun resort. I came with a group of eight we checked in to 2 rooms penthouse and a one bed room. My wife and I after checking in to the one bed room decided to see if we could upgrade to a 2 bed room. After a couple of hours by the pool we went to the front desk and they had a 2 bed room available. We packed up our stuff and moved to the 2 Bedroom. The next day my wife realizes that she left her engagement and wedding band rings in the bathroom of the one bed room.We called security and met up with them in the room. We just missed house cleaning and the rings were gone. We filed a police report and the investigation is open....On a different note the gym was awful with minimal equipment and tight space.If you had three people running on the treadmills the power would trip in the room. One of the elliptical machines didn't work which was annoying.Front Desk and Security were very helpful but I wish I never had to go to security in the first place.The rooms were nice and clean and the penthouse room was large. Unfortunately they assign rooms first come first serve... That means if you are an owner in the time share you can get stuck with a bad view of the construction and a non-owner gets the amazing view you should get.I will not be going back or recommend any of my friends to stay at the Cancun resort in Las Vegas.
21,305,"May 24 2009 	Very nice except for pool rule	We swapped our week for a week here. The unit was very nice. It was clean and since it is located about 4 miles from the big hotels, very quiet. We had a one bedroom. There was a king size bed and two bathrooms, one of which was very large. The unit was small but certainly plenty big enough for two people. The small kitchen was fine for us, but might be too cramped if cooking for a family. We had a rental car so I don't know about the shuttle. They had a beautiful pool area with slides and a waterfall. However, there was a &quot;no outside food or drink&quot; rule. It was 98 degrees and dry so you couldn't be outside without something to drink. My husband doesn't break rules, so this spoiled this area for us. (We are too cheap to spend several dollars on a drink, but after all staying in a time share is supposed to be for those of us who are economically minded!) Anyway, we are from Florida so the pool wasn't that important. Vegas was fun, Hoover Dam was interesting, and Death Valley was fabulous -- spend one night there. We enjoyed our vacation, and I would recommend this as a good place to stay."
22,305,"May 17 2009 	Great Place for a Family to Stay	We were in Vegas for our daughters wedding at the Bellagio. Our son, his wife and 8 month old stayed with us. The Cancun was the perfect place to spend the week where we could &quot;get away&quot; from the craziness of the strip. It was very quiet, clean, and had a beautiful pool area. We exchanged our Mexican timeshare for this 2 bedroom condo. As many have said, the rooms are a little dated, but roomy and comfortable, especially great with having a baby with us. We never used a shuttle as our son had his car with him. The drive into town was quick and easy. The airport, grocery store, several restaurants, and shopping were conveniently close. We were happy to find a washer &amp; dryer in our building. Something to be aware of, some 2-bedrooms have a Queen bed in the 2nd room, some have 2 twin beds. We were NEVER approached about touring or purchasing a timeshare - we were pleasantly surprised about that. If I were to point out any negative, it would be the main bathroom. The shower head was badly in need of a vinegar soak so there would be decent pressure and waterflow. A lightbulb was out in the bathroom - took about 4 calls to get someone there to replace it. The pool area is probably the biggest plus for the Cancun. There was pleasant music playing, there were several hammocks to lay with the baby for a nap, and ample tables and chairs. We would definitely stay there again."
23,305,"Apr 29 2009 	Everything we were looking for!	My husband and I just returned from a short 3 day stay. We were looking to relax by the pool and have the option to be in the middle of the excitement if we wanted to. Upon arrival, our check in was very quick and friendly. We were pleasantly surprised at our room. I had requested a pool view, not only did they make sure we had that, it was on the top floor with one of the best views you can get of the resort! Sure, the rooms are dated a little. That didn't matter to us though. The staff at the resort was very nice and we were not approached one time about the timeshare bit. We were kind of on guard about that. One of the resturaunts was closed which also didn't matter much. The Caribe lounge did the trick. Really we just used that for snacks and drinks. We only wish they had a swim up bar, we may not have spent as much time laying in the chairs getting burnt!!!! So, I only have one complaint about the resort and it's not really something that they can control.... There is a rule about no outside food and drink in the pool area, they were pretty relaxed about that rule as long as you were bringing your drinks in plastic cups. As the day went on, we noticed one VERY LARGE FAMILY that had staked their claim on several tables and brought in all of their own food, drinks and stereo!!!!!!!! The resort has great music playing all the time so I don't know what their deal was. I really wanted to say something to the resort staff because I truely felt that this family was detracting from the wonderful ambiance the pool area had. We were there to relax and have fun though so I decided to order another drink and ignore them!!!!!!! I guess that's what it's all about. One last thing, other reviewers complained about the long wait for the shuttle to the strip. They had 2 shuttles running the entire time and we never waited more than 5 minutes!!! They really did a great job. We really did enjoy this resort and will return again."
24,305,Apr 12 2009 	Amazing Family Destination	My wife and I and our 3 children have just returned from a spring break trip here. We stayed in a 2 bedroom 6 person suite. It had a 1 king and one queen and a pull out bed settee. The kitchen was well supplied. No need to bring beach towels as they are provided down by the pool. The resort has 2 pools and a number of hot tubs. There are waterslides. The staff from front desk to house keeping were very helpful. The place was clean and tidy and of a high standard. I would recommend hiring a car but there is a shuttle bus provided which takes you to the Tropicana Hotel in about 10minsThere is a grocery store across the street as well as a CVS pharmacy.Your are only 5 minutes from the Las Vegas Outlet Mall and restaurants and 10 minutes from the airport.Excellent trip would highly recommendThe gym was small for the size of the complex and got a bit crowded and stuffy
25,305,"Apr 5 2009 	Great value but timeshare talk was annoying	The hotel gets a 9 out of 10 from me. About 3 miles south of the major casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, it's a little quieter but convenient. Great price, very clean rooms, superb pool, friendly staff. The only downside was twice being asked about buying a timeshare. I didn't go there to be pitched. I came for vacation and was treated rudely once when turning them down. Kinda put a damper on the place. So, if you can handle being pitched, stay there. It's a very nice place."
26,305,"Apr 1 2009 	A restful place in Sin City	We booked a package through Orbitz and deliberately picked this resort because it was off the strip and had a bedroom and a kitchen.The positives:We enjoyed having 2 bathrooms, 1 with a full shower and the other with a jetted tub. I took a leisurely bath with plenty of hot water. It was great to have a full kitchen with everything provided for cooking. There is a grocery store and Starbucks across the street so we were set. We also enjoyed having a separate bedroom and liked the living room with the couch and the deck. The pool is really nice with 4 water slides and a fountain. Everything is in Mexican decor, including the pool. Also, we asked for the top floor and a quiet room and received one. It was quiet the entire time we were there even though it was spring break.The negatives:The pool wasn't heated and there weren't any adults in it, just kids. We tried to go in but settled for the hot tub instead. Some of the furniture was showing a lot of wear. Way too early of a check out time: 10:00, most places are noon. Beware, it's a time share and they'll tell you they have a free gift for you and some coupons, but it's really an invitation to see their time share presentation and they will give you a gift for your time. We passed on that. Overall, this is the 4th time I've gone to Vegas and was the most relaxing place to stay. I'd recommend it to others, especially families. Secondly, take in a show, we saw Cirque du Soleil Love with Beatle's music and it was fabulous. Also we ate at the Fashion Show Mall at the Capital Grille and had outstanding food and service - ask for Stephanie, she's awesome!"
27,305,"Mar 26 2009 	Perfect Spring Break	Just got back from a week at Cancun Resort during spring break.I booked a 2bdr (strip view) through Expedia for about USD$60 night.For this price you probably get a one star motel elsewhere, especially during spring break, so nobody should complain.The resort is very well maintained since there are also rooms available for time share purchase.The kids had a blast at the pool and slides, we had some very warm days in the middle of the week.The room was very large with two bathrooms, both with whirpool tubs.Stuff very friendly and helpful.Very dissapointed with the shows on the strip, few new shows, very few kids friendly and etremely expensive (such as Cirque de Soleil shows).I would definitely recommend the resort for families with small kids."
28,305,"Mar 22 2009 	An Oasis in the desert	We stayed on the Strip for one week and then wanted to get out of the crowds and the dirty streets so moved here for our second week! What a great move! The whole complex was spotless - which is really important to me. The pool area was just perfect - used the pool every day. Free shuttle service to the Strip and back (until midnight). Grocery store and pharmacy just across the street. Outlet Malls a brisk 15 minute walk north. Bus service right outside the door - we utilized the bus service daily - easy to use and friendly drivers. Only two complaints - charged for wi-fi internet access (should be free) and very, very uncomfortable living room furniture! The mattress in the master bedroom is just about ready for a change as well. Other than that, loved the place and would definitely recommend to friends."
29,305,"Mar 10 2009 	Great stay but a good distance from the action.	Stayed here this past weekend with some friends as one of them had a timeshare here. We got a pretty nice room with two bedrooms and jacuzzis in both bathrooms. I say jacuzzis, but these things were like two person hot tubs. They were big and deep. They had three TVs, full kitchen, etc. The balcony was huge and had a nice view of the strip even though we wanted a pool view room. In any case, the beds were queens, but we could have used more pillows. Since we did not notice this until about 4 am, we did not bother them with this request.  The pool area is beautiful. Although it was a little chilly when we were there, there are two big pools, one with a few large waterslides that looked really fun. I'm sure this is overrun by small children in the warmer seasons. There are five hot tubs including one underneath a waterfall. This is relaxing, but loud and not conducive to conversation. There are others with hammocks around them and what not. Very nice groups with a huge replica of a Mayan pyramid in the middle. No outside food or drink as I was told by my nervous 18 year old lifeguard, because you have to buy theirs from the cafe and/or bar. We just brought ours down anyway and poured it in cups. Everyone else did too, so stop cryin! The fitness center was more of a closet. Nevertheless, I managed to get a very good workout in with the equipment that they have. You just have to think outside the box a little. The thing that bother me though was that the circuit kept blowing for the treadmills, so we had to keep flipping the switch in the circuit box. This probably happened every five minutes when two of the three treadmills were being used simultaneously.  As for the location, it is about five miles from the heart of the strip. Not bad for a short drive. The shuttle stops at 12, which pretty much makes it useless as that is when people need a DD. But if you want to avoid the hassles of strip driving during the day then maybe it is worth it. There is not much around, but there is a 24 hour bar across the street if you came to Vegas for that. Not me, but if you are sick of the strip or don't like people, this might be your spot. There are some food options, a food 4 less, and CVS for your convenience. If you have no car, this place would be pretty difficult as I hear cab fares are expensive to the action. I heard that the timeshare people were pretty annoying, but I didn't see any. I guess most people that stay here already have them, but some told us that the people still bothered them. Not sure how the price/experience would be if you didn't have a timeshare."
30,305,"Feb 28 2009	Short but pleasant trip	After visiting San Francisco for two nights, my wife and I came to Las Vegas and the Cancun Resort for two nights, before heading home and me going back to Baghdad. We were greeted very warmly at the front desk and received our room promptly. After checking in, my wife complained that the room had a funny smell and housekeeping came quickly to check and spray the whole suite with deodorizer which took care of the problem. The one room suite was a little on the small size, with a very cramped kitchen, bedroom and living room, but the bathroom was very roomy. The Jacuzzi tub didnt have a stopper, so we were only able to take showers, but that was no biggie. The furnishings seemed a little dated and worn, but serviceable. We had reserved a car through a family friend employed by one of the major car-rental companies and they couldnt find our reservation, so we wound taking a taxi to the resort. The concierge was very helpful in arranging a car at a good rate through Enterprise for us for a day, so we could take a site-seeing trip to Hoover Dam. The rest of the time we used the shuttle service, which was adequate, although not as timely as advertised. The driver actually remembered us from one day to the next, and was very helpful in getting us to the show we were going to see and getting us back to the resort afterwards. We didnt have a chance to use the pool as it was a little cool the few days we were there, but it did look very nice. As posted on previous reviews, there was a lack of information in the room, and we could not find an internet connection (for free or a fee), something we have gotten used to when staying at other hotels. We reserved the room through a family member who is a timeshare member and used his points, so overall the value was average. Ive stayed at much higher priced name-brand hotels and received less satisfaction. Ive also stayed at lower rated hotels which were better."
31,305,"Feb 23 2009 	unbeatable	We just spent 4 nights on the Strip and then 4 nights at this resort. This place was a dream. The rooms were more upscale than our 4-star hotel on the strip, and they were roomy, which we loved the best. The granite coutertops and two oversized jetted tubs were delightful. Staff were prompt and attentive. We really can't see how anyone can complain about this place. The mountainviews from the eighth floor were incredible. The pool was heated with a lifeguard on duty and they had jacuzzi's outside, more than we can say for the hotel on the strip (Monte Carlo). Its pool was closed although the rooms were three times as much as the Cancun resort. It was so close to the strip. Can't believe what a great deal this was!!!!"
32,305,"Jan 31 2009 	Beautiful resort close to the strip	Stayed at this property for 8 nights in November. Upon arrival it is very impressive both from the outside and in.The pool area with the waterfalls are absolutely beautiful. My only complain is that the large pool is closed this time if year, even though the weather was warm.We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen, living room, bedroom and ensuite bath with a 2 persoon jacuzzi. The room also had a large balcony overlooking the strip as well as a second bathroom with shower off the living room.The room was very clean and not outdated at all!The shuttle service runs very frequently from the hotel to the strip. A taxi costs about $15.00.Across the street is a large grocery store with very cheap pricing on all food and goods. We never ate out once because of this!Outlet shopping centre only about a 15 minute walk.If you want to get away from the strip and relax, than this is the place to be!"
33,305,"Jan 28 2009 	Park Bench Sofa	Concurring with other reviewers, the place is ok, but calling it a &quot;Resort&quot; is definitely a stretch. I was there to attend a trade show involving serious walking every day. Coming back to the room and sitting on their furniture was literally painful - I had to grab pillows from the bed to soften the sofa somewhat. It was best to relax on the bed instead.As mentioned by other reviewers, the kitchen is a postage stamp, the coffee brewer way too yucky to think about using, no exhaust fan in either bathroom (anybody gotta match?), and limited garage parking. I also have a big problem paying additional fees ($5/day) for internet access. The place has more of a motel feel (although all of the motels I stay at DO have free internet) than a &quot;Resort&quot;."
34,305,"Jan 22 2009 	Great Hotel	We are a family of 5 from Australia visiting the States for the first time.After doing lots of research on where to stay in Las Vegas and after reading reviews, we decided the Cancun Resort would best suit our family.We were pleasantly surprised how nice this hotel was and how great the price was. It was also a plus that it was a non smoking hotel.Our booking was for a 2 bedroom unit. One bedroom contained a king size bed with a bathroom and the other bedroom had a queen bed. There was also a second bathroom, dining table and a fully self contained kitchen. The living area contained a fold out sofa bed. There was also a balcony to look out over the strip. Our unit was kept very clean.Each floor of the hotel had a laundry service room so we were able to wash our clothes very easily after all our travelling.This hotel had a fanastic pool area which would be great in summer, but the weather was a bit too cool for us when we were there.Staying at this hotel gave us easy excess to the strip as it was a 10 minute drive to any of the casino's, if there was no traffic jams. There was a super market across the street and an outlet shopping centre within a 5 minute drive.Our stay here was very enjoyable, I was so glad we didn't stay in one of the smoke smelling casino's."
35,305,Jan 8 2009 	It is an EXCELLENT place for family!	This is a great place for families and friends. I liked the pool area with the lil bar and everything. its comfy. Espicially with the spa bath. Its comfortable to sit down and watch a movie with the family.
36,305,"Jan 5 2009 	Cancun Resort: Very Comfortable!	We stayed at the Cancun Resort for 2 weeks during the National Finals Rodeo in Vegas. We had a two bedroom suite, and it was great. Very quiet, clean and away from all the hustle and still in a prime spot at the end of the strip basicly. I would highly recommend the resort if you want the quiet time. Also there are kitchens so you can cook etc. and not eat out all the time. Great place to stay!"
37,305,"Dec 31 2008 	Not the best not the worst. I will not be back to this property.	The Cancun Resort Las Vegas is satisfactory if you are looking for a hotel off the beaten path in LV.The two bedroom suite we had was ok, but housekeeping was lacking. The same crushed sunflower seed (not from me) stayed on the carpet the entire week's stay. When we checked out, I looked under the bed in the case I had dropped something and boy, I wish I hadn't looked. It was clear they do not vacuum under there and none of the detritus/garbage had been from me. The living room carpet was wet the entire stay and nothing was done. Our coffee was NEVER replenished. One day our bath mat was gone and on four separate days we did not receive service at all.I will say that the jet bathtubs were fantastic after a day walking!The internet in the 'Business Centre&quot; is credit card only and took 4.5 minutes to load the first site.The shuttle drivers were AWESOME. they should have been hired as concierge. The concierge I spoke to twice had no information at all to help me on two rather basic questions!To top it off, the airport had been closed the first night and they charged us for it - even though there was no way we could have arrived!!"
38,305,"Dec 4 2008 	Nice Stay	My Husband and I decided to stay at the Cancun Resort for the Thanksgiving Weekend. We stayed in a 1 bedroom condo which I thought was cute but its very small. (We stayed in a 1 bedroom condo at the MGM Signature and that place was very spacious.) The Pros: Pretty cozy for two people, the master bathroom was very spacious with a comfortable jucuzzi tub, the bed was very comfortable, the kitchen was fully stock with everything you can ask for, the staff were pretty helpful, and even though it was too cold to swim the pool looked absoultely amazing. Now for the Cons: Though the kitchen was fully stock it was very tiny. Everything seem so cramped together. The bedroom I felt was a little small, you couldn't really move around because everything was close together. I thought the parking wasn't very good. The under ground parking lot could only hold about 30 cars, and if you can't find parking underground you gotta park outside. Although, the rooms are pretty small my husband and I still had a pretty good stay. We would definitely go back."
39,305,"Nov 4 2008 	Nice resort; Clean rooms; Quiet	I expected the resort to be a bit nicer, given the II rating. We stayed in a 2 bedroom, which was quite smaller than most we have stayed in. There was seating in the living room for a thin 4 only and not comfortable. The pull out was a futon type. You could not sit on the balcony without feeling closed in as the stucco wall was at least 4 feet tall and hence you could not see over if sitting. Although we were on floor 2 and I did notice that the upper floors had plexiglass. The room was clean, however we were not provided with dish or dishwashing soap, but received promptly when asked for. The kitchen was small and you could not open the dishwasher more than 6 inches because the door would hit the fridgerator. (tacky) In one of the bedrooms, the TV/cabinet was on the side of the bed, poor planning for the lay out. The staff was all friendly and helpful. Shuttle service was posted as every 20-30 minutes, however it was more like every 40-50 minutes. Also, shuttle only holds 14 so if there is more than that waiting, call a cab. 2 buses Friday, Saturday however. Drop off to Tropicana averages 8-10 minutes. One of the drivers drove as if driving a manual transmission, hold steady for him. If you want to head down to the strip prior to noon, out of luck for the shuttle, it does not start service until 12:15. Use Deuce to travel up and down the strip from there at a cost of $5.00 all day. We did walk to the factory stores one day and took the Deuce from there to the strip. There is a bus stop as well outside the resort, but we did not use. The Deuce will also drop you off at Town Center, very nice shops and restaurants, then short cab ride back to the resort. If your on a timeline for a show, don't wait for shuttle, taxis come around every 5-10 minutes and the front will call for one also.There is no helpuful information provided in the room. Nothing about the resort at all, nothing about the surrounding areas, recommendations, transportation, laundry, gym, internet, towels, etc. Yes, you could wait for the concierge, but so much easier to have in the room.Pool was very nice. Never had any trouble finding a chair, however this is the off season. Gym was very small. Packed into a converted room? I expected something more because they do advertise a spa. Overall, if you are looking for some place quiet, family oriented, out of the way and clean, this is for you."

41,305,"Oct 13 2008 	If you are under 100 - A place to avoid!	We went there on a timeshare promotion. With that said, you would have expected it to be GRAND. It was anything but. The checkin was like checking in to a Motel 6 or Super 8 rather than a Las Vegas hotel. I have stayed at many of the Strip hotels in the past, and decided to give something of this nature a try, but I was sorely disappointed in almost all aspects of the hotel and staff.The room was a 1 bedroom. Ok in that regard, but nothing spectacular. The elevator did not work on the second day, so we were hoofing it up and down the stairs located at the far ends of the building. We called down to ask for an extra blanket, but were told that they were out. They brought us an extra set of sheets instead. This is not a typical hotel, so do not expect daily maid service to refresh the towels and make the beds. If you stay more than 5 days, then they will do this. Otherwise you have to pick up fresh towels etc. if you need them.The pool was nice to look at, but it was cold and windy this October, so we did not get a chance to use that. The biggest disappointment was the staff! They seemed to be bothered if you had a question to ask them. When we checked in, we asked the concierge a few questions, and he just seemed put off that we would interrupt him.If you are going here for a timeshare promotion, I would highly suggest skipping this offer. Our package included the following items (I am also including their real descriptions as well):We arrived at 7:45 PM on Friday night, and the tour desk was closed. Therefore we could not get any of our promotional coupons until Saturday (2nd day of our 3 day stay). We went to the touor desk Saturday at 8:00 AM to register for our promotional tour, but they told us the earliest they have available is 3:00 PM. Right in the middle of the day. Remember, you cannot get your gift coupons etc. until you complete your tour presentation! 2 Complimentary Sahara Buffet Coupons: Really, the Sahara buffet is $6.99 regular price. The coupons are not good for weekend breakfast, lunch or brunch. They are good only Monday thru Friday for all meals, and then Saturday and Sunday for dinner only. But it is a $6.99 buffet, and that should speak for itself! Not getting these until after the tour on Saturday made these almost worthless.50% off golf. They offered only one course and the price would have been $40 to $60 per person with the discount. Now remember, you have to go on a 2 hour promotional tour that you cannot book until 8:00 AM on Saturday morning. This tour will most likely be in the afternoon, cutting into your golf time...Mac Kink Comedy show tickets: You must buy a $10 dollar drink. Show is at 1PM and 3PM Tuesday thru Saturday. Show is located at the Harrahs Casino.Shark Reef Exhibit: This is the only decent thing in the package! Tickets are around $15 each. I have been before, and it was OK at best. At $10 each it would be a better value.Nathan Burton Magic Show: Lance Burton is the magician you want to see in vegas. This was at hooters casino. No show on Saturday nights. What good vegas show does not run on Saturday night? Thus you could imagine that this is a worthless show as well. Since you cannot get your tickets until after your presentation tour, you would have to stay late Sunday night to see it. UGH.....$100 promotional slot play: This is a coupon for promo slot play at the Casino Royale casino (up by Treasure Island). This was a complete waste of time. You go there, and they have about 20 machines that accept these coupons. You cannot cash out at any time, even if you are winning more credits on the machine. Basically, if you can muster up 4,000 credts then you can call an attendant and get $100 cash. NOT GOING to happen I am telling you. Do not waste your time. I am posative that Casino Royale pays Pacific Monarch to put this in their package as a way to drive to some business up to their area.Hawaii or Los Cabos add on vacation: Again a waste of time. like most of these, they are restricted to weekday arrival and departure.When we did not buy the timeshare package, the finance guy as well as the sales guy both got visibly upset and almost angry. What did they expect. From the beginning, we had explained to our sales guy that we were very unhappy with the staff attitudes as well as the promotional gifts that were sold as usable, but in reality were not!I could not have been more disappointed with the accomodations and the staff at this resort! If you have an option, I would not stay at this place! I have never written a review on this site before, but I feel compelled to help others avoid this trap!"
42,305,"Oct 12 2008 	Best place we stayed at	We chose this place based on the Tripadvisor reviews and were delighted to have picked such a great place to stay.We travelled with 2 teenagers but had 2 large bedroomsas well as a lounge ,deck ,kitchen and 2 large double bathrooms.All for a price much cheaper than anywhere else in our 2 weeks around California.We loved the pool which was open great hours and was big enough for training swimmimg and just blobbing and the quiet relaxed feel of the place.We didnt eat there as we used the car in and out of the strip which was an easy drive especially as the casinos dont charge for parking.The only minor issue was the realatively high cost of using the internet in the games room.Most other places have some free service now so this could be looked at.Apart from that we would happily return."
43,305,"Oct 9 2008 	Loved It	I read most of the reviews for this resort prior to my vacation. I have to say that there were both positive and negative things said. My husband and I stayed at this resort while celebrating an anniversary. I have to say that I loved this resort. It was clean, the staff and other guests were very pleasant. They had shuttle to and from the strip but, it ended at 12 midnight. That was my only problem. But, if you missed the shuttle or decided to spend extra time on the strip, the bus stop was right in front of the resort. We were accessible to many restaurants and stores at this location. We even had the bank that we bank at across the street from us. I had been to Vegas many times and this was my first time not staying on the actual strip and I loved it. It was so quiet and people not running in and out all night and day. There were 2 restaurants on the property and they both had great food. The pool, of my goodness, the pool was fabulous. They also had whirlpools around the property and a hammock section. I am sorry to say that we didn't utilize the spa but, I heard from other guests that it was lovely. Now, we had a situation with our credit card before leaving but the bank fed ex a new one to us immediately at the resort. The front desk called us immediately when the new card arrived. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone. We really enjoyed our anniversary and the resort."
44,305,"Oct 4 2008 	50/50	My husband loved this place while I was so-so on it. The best part of this resort is the pool. Only down side to the pool is that it closes at 10 p.m. Seems too early for Vegas nightlife. If you want to be away from the people, noise,and traffic of the strip this is a good location. Close to I-15. Our room was not very comfortable. While it had everything we needed, it just was not comfortable. Lights in the bathrooms were dim and made it hard to see in the mirror. Had some maintance issues, but chose not to deal with them - after all, we were on vacation. Didn't want to deal with people coming in to fix something, so we did without. That was our choice. On the plus side our room had a great view of the strip. Balcony was huge, just wish there would have been a couple lounge chairs so we could really enjoy. As it was, there were two chairs with a small table. Again, it comes back to that comfort thing. If using our timeshare again, I would try another resort if available over this one. Nothing terribly wrong, just would have liked it better with a few small changes."
45,305,"Sep 28 2008 	Perfection Perfection Perfection	WOW and double OMG! The Cancun Resort was Fantastic! We took months to carefully plan our two week holiday in Vegas and we were not disappointed except in one area, which I will get too in a minute! Only one thing was off putting.We watched the reviews of the Cancun, here on Trip Advisor, very closely and at one point even wrote to the head office of the resort because we had concerns. Not only did we get a prompt reply of reassurrance from the general manager of the hotel himself, when we got there we were not disappointed with our room or the resort but the reassurance given by the general manager was not true. We had one bedroom apartment in building number two. Room 2228. It was perfect! I will add our video of the room when we arrived so you can see! The quality of the video isn't great because its taken with my point and shoot camera but you will get the idea! The staff there was amazing! We had an unexpected lay over in Philly because of Tropical Storm Hannah, so when we arrive we desparately just wanted to go to our room and sleep. When we arrived at the Cancun, they had just lost complete power on one side of the resort and told us that we would have to wait to book in as their computer systems had lost power too. After we told them how tired we were and that aren't a new check in, that we should have checked in the day before and that I had called to let them know we had to lay over in Philly, they cheerfully found us a room in about 5 minutes! We got to our room and it was everything we had hoped and more. The concerige desk helped us each and every day with taxi's, info about the area, finding restaurants, walmart, grocery stores and even helped us plan our tours of the Grand Canyon and Hoover Damn! Everyday their was unlimited, knowledgable help with a smile! Our room was cleaned every single day! On the days we left a do not disturb sign on the door, housekeeping would call to make sure that we didn't want our room cleaned or trash taken away or clean towels! EVERY DAY!!!!! The pool area is just as gorgeous as it in the pics online! We enjoyed the pool by day and enjoyed the strip by night. We loved the water slides, well our son did and we loved the many hot tubs! (Especially the one by the hammocks!). They have noodles and really great water beds you can sign out. If you want a water bed get one early about 8:30am. Some life guards only sign one out per room while others sign out as many as a person likes and leaves none for others. Its not very standardised. I just thinks some life guards don't follow the policy of one per room. The water beds were all in great condition.The grocery store across the road was perfect to get our breakfast and lunch groceries from but make sure to take a taxi. It only costs a couple of dollars and it is much safer! As for taxi's make sure to ask for a Deluxe taxi! Don't use any others. Deluxe was the only ones that didn't rip us off! By the end of our first week there we knew our way around and stopped some cabbies from taking us the long way around! Food off the strip is so much better then on the strip! Its worth the few extra miles drive! Speaking of driving! The hotel is only about 10 mintues from the strip. We used the Cancun shuttle most of the time going into the strip. It was timely and comfortable but would definately rent a car next time! Everything is not as close as it looks! If you remember anything about Vegas....remember this! Everything is not as close as it looks! Sooo, to sum it all up! Cancun has th wow facture and is quiet and peaceful. Things do pick up there on Fridays and Saturdays when a lot of day passers come in with their coolers and picnics and kids. The review below about that is true and it was one of the things we wrote to the head office about and while they assurred us it wasn't true, it is! Unfortunately, a fair few of those day passers are less then quality people who respect others space. I do hope I stated that fairly. The only way to improve on our visit to the Cancun would be to stop the day trippers, coolers and picnicers which can make you feel like your vacationing in a trailer park."
46,305,"Sep 23 2008 	Beautiful Room!	We loved our stay at the Cancun Resort. It is a beautiful place with a beautiful pool south of the strip. It was so nice to have a condo rather than a hotel room - having the living room separate from the bedroom gave me the chance to try and catch a few hours sleep in this busy city! The jacuzzi in the bathroom was wonderful after a long day! We were very happy to have a balcony. We went to the grocery store across the street and filled up the fridge with groceries on the first day to save on some dining costs! This is a timeshare facility - and we purchased a tour package for $199, and it was well worth it. This provided us with five nights stay at this 5 Star resort as well as many added bonuses/gift certificates/tickets to shows in Vegas which we took advantage of.I would love to go back to The Cancun for another stay but it is a few miles away from the strip and I would like to try staying on the strip next time to avoid paying for a car rental! (the hotel does offer a shuttle to the strip, though, if I'm not mistaken)"
47,305,"Sep 19 2008	ok	well we got to the hotel, when we got their I asked the receptionist if we may have our room, she said check at 1pmso we did and she did not have no room... My friend and I were kinda mad, but around 2pm I asked the receptionist again if they had a room already she called her boss and he told me they had a problem with the rooms we wanted to stay at...they did not had no lights so they sent us to south point hotelthats a nice hotel.."
48,305,"Sep 16 2008 	Low-end condo	We arrived on a Sunday a couple of hours before check-in and rooms were not available yet, which was fine. They directed us to another desk to get our parking pass and a temporary pool pass while we waited for our room. We declined and came back a few hours later. This time our room was ready, but they notified us they would be immediately taking out a $100 deposit from our credit card. OK, fine.Proceeding to our room in our car, we first noticed the poorly designed parking situation. There are about 5 buildings in the complex (and they're building more) and each has a semi-underground parking area which holds about 25-30 cars. Everyone else has to park outside. During our week stay, we were rarely fortunate to get an underground spot. The real drawback is that if you park outside, you must walk down the garage parking ramps to get to the elevators to your room. This is extremely dangerous, especially at night. Additionally, the resort attracts a lot of families and this is just not a good situation.There is a card key reader which allows access into the waiting area for the elevators. This door was NEVER locked. Free access for anyone. The waiting area was always very dirty with loose trash. The 2-bedroom condo is smaller than many others we have stayed in except for the bathrooms which are very nice and very large. The kitchen is tiny, about the size of a closet. It does have a refrig, microvave, range, and dishwasher. Very little counter space. The living area is the absolute worst I have ever seen in a time share or condo. There is one sofa and one chair. The sofa is so cheap and uncomfortable that we couldn't sit on it for more than a half hour. Chair wasn't much better. Carpet was torn in several places and stained in others. TV was flat screen, but fairly small. Adequate number of channels, but no pay channels.Bedrooms were OK, but also on the small side. Only one lamp on one side of the bed. Not enough space for the other side I guess. There was a spacious balcony, but was only furnished with two cheap plastic chairs. A/C worked well, and rooms were fairly quiet expect for those slamming their doors in the hallway.Families will love the pool area and schedule of activities available. There is a snack bar under the mayan temple which seemed to do a pretty good business. Staff was nonexistent except for the lifeguards and the periodic time share salesmen. Luckily, we were never solicited. Location at the south end of the strip is OK since your away from the hustle and bustle area. Across the street is a grocery store, irish pub, and a few other stores. You're about 4 miles from Mandalay Bay to the north, about a mile from the Silverton which ir right across I-15, and about 2 miles from the South Point casino resort. They do have shuttle service to the Tropicana.There's not much choice right now for those looking for a timeshare exchange in Vegas and if you are, I'd avoid this one unless you really need a big pool and want to be away from the strip."
49,305,"Sep 11 2008 	Great place for nervous parents	I was pretty nervous to go to vegas as first trip for my 9 mo old baby...and another 4 yr old boy and in-laws...well, it worked out great. Thanks to tripadvisor reviews and recommendations as always.Got a good deal for 2 bedroom suite facing the strip.Plus points :1. pool2. jacuzzu tubs - kids loved the vast tubs3. everyday housekpeeing4. Great cost - 126/- for sat , 106/- for weekday nights5. closeness to strip6. kitchen/refrigerator/microwave- with utensils etc.7. Free show tickets to Manadalay Bay Sark Reef and Nathan burton show for 6 people - for attending the 90 min timeshare presnetation.Could have done better :1. 2 room suite description says king bed, queen bed, sofa queen bed..well what we found was 1 queen bed, 2 twin beds and 1 queen sofa bed....so not having king bed was very uncomfortanble with baby.2. To our surprise, we dound no light in our bldg no.5 ...as transistor for bldg 4 had blown out..so imagine coming back to hotel with kids around 11 pm and finding no light on 1st day after driving all day !!! To our respite, light cam be back in our bldg around midnight..but no light for building 4....I would imagine resort to be welle equipped to handle such scenario...but no consolation/compensation from mgmt for all that inconvenience !!!That's about all...to sum it up, I would still recommend this place to others but just to verify beds in advance.Thanks,Shruti"
50,305,"Sep 2 2008 	Had a great time!	My husband and I stayed at the Cancun for 7 nights. We had a 1 bedroom/2 bath villa. We liked being off the strip, because it felt more restful. The shuttle service worked great for us, but for some the 12pm to 12:15am schedule wouldn't work well. A taxi from Mandalay Bay to the resort was about $20.00, so it would be a considerable cost if you were out past the last shuttle every night. The rooms were very clean, but the furniture was old. However, the bed was comfortable, and that's the most important thing. I read one review about cockroaches and it scared me, but there wasn't a single bug in our room. I was very impressed with how clean it was.The pool was fun! The water slides are fun even for adults! The only negative thing I have to say about the pool was how salty it tasted. Accidentaly swallowing water or even licking ones lips was not a pleasant experience. All that in consideration, the large pool was a much needed thing in the Vegas heat!Getting groceries from Food4Less was a great way for us to save money. It was just a short walk across the streeet. We ate breakfast/lunch in our room and only ate dinners on the strip. Here's a tip for those who are beginning gamblers... Hooters Casino has $3.00 minimum blackjack tables and it's right next to the shuttle drop off! We were there almost everyday. Don't expect too much from the dealers in way of personality (it's sort of hit or miss) but the low minimum is a great way to learn the game without risking large amounts of money. Fremont Street is also a great place to play lower limit games. Ride the Deuce!!! The bus goes from the South of the Strip all the way to Fremont street. A one way ticket is $2.00, but a 24 hour pass is only $5.00. Once we learned about this, we didn't take another taxi unless it was an absolute necessity. This is by far the cheapest way to get around on the strip. Walking is often just a little too far. It's not the fastest transportation though, because it makes so many stops... but it worked for us. The bus that goes from the South tip of the Strip past the Cancun resort stops at 1am, so it's not a good way to get back to the resort."
51,305,"Aug 17 2008 	Perfect!!!	I've stayed at a lot of places in Vegas, but I would never stay anywhere else again,. Had an absolute blast! Rooms were great with full kitchens, two bathrooms, living and dining rooms, and private balconies. It's like a oasis all in itself in and amongst the Vegas craziness. Wtih adult billards/foos ball room, kids room, water slides, restaurants and louging areas. It provides a free shuttle to the Tropicana to get to the strip, has a grocery store directly across the street and a casino in walking distance. For my family, (1 child) it's the perfect place to stay and be able to enjoy Vegas at the same time. We even hired a nanny service for going out on the strip one night. Watch out, they tried to over charge us, (said that kids from separate families are additional, however didn't stipulate that over the phone.) They are not part of The Cancun, and they are my only complaint."
52,305,"Aug 10 2008 	WORKED A TREAT FOR US!	2 adults 2 young kids. We had a 2 bedroomed apartment with 2 bathrooms, each with a jacuzzi tub! It was a really nice apartment in very nice condition - we were very pleased. Cost us $160 a night.The breakfast in the cafe was lovely - really nice french toast and pancakes freshly made. The pools were great - the kids loved them and there was nothing better than to swim at night (we booked it because the pools opened at 8am and shut at 10pm).The location is about 2 miles from the edge of the strip, so not too far away at all.In all, full marks."
53,305,"Aug 5 2008 	agree with mother of riverside	we arrived on friday night . after a long trip with the kids the whole trip there was mostly talked about the water slides my two boys were very exicited since we got there late on friday at 9.30 there was not much to do we unpacked .... so saturday morning we went for breakfast took the kids to circus circus came back to the resort around 1.00 pm we got all ready for the pool /slides again we were very excited we notice the loogoon pool was closed i asked the young lady that was working in the towel dept.. why was it closed she replied beaucuse everyone is in the back as we proceed to go to the back pool omg it did look like a cheap place in t.j there was no place to sit . i was like what the heck then we realized the slides were closed down ...... wondering why ? my kids were upset drove 5 hours for nothing we could of stayed home in our own pool ..... so i was still curiuos and i asked a lady there did she knew why was it closed she said beaucuse someone pooped in the pool i guessed it had happend on thursday too ,that is grossed... someone ruined it for everyone else , my suggestion to the manegment is that when checking in they should give out free water diaper to toddlers ,babies that s how they do it in our other time share in the recreation dept activity room you get free water diapers i personally think this would of been a great idea iknow there were very upset people there that weekend including my family spend alot of money for a sorry weekend all for something that could of been preventable"
54,305,"Jul 31 2008 	Never again !!!	I booked this resort directly from the timeshare owner. When our family of four arrived at the hotel we had no problems getting into the poolview room I requested.We checked in on Thursday nite. Our room was a one bedroom two bath suite. The bathrooms were beautiful, the one off the master had a wonderful double jacuzzi tub. The room itself was on the small side, barely enough room for the king sized bed in the bedroom, and when the couch was folded out, it took up the entire living room. That was okay though, we weren't there to sit in our room.I booked this hotel specifically for the pool. It is huge with 4 waterslides. Since it is over 100 degrees in Vegas at this time of year, I knew we would sit by the pool by day and go into town in the evening.On Friday morning we went down to the pool , got a nice spot with a hammock, and checked out a couple of rafts from the equipment room. The rafts were completly falling apart, but they were great for floating around the pool and reading. It was so nice a peaceful, all of the pool chairs never filled up! One problem, someone pooped in the main pool mid-afternoon and the pool was closed for the rest of the day.Saturday morning, we went down to check out the rafts and the lifeguard told me they weren't checking the rafts out (although they sat in a stack on the floor). She said the rafts were in such bad shape they were sending them back and would have no rafts until the replacements came. I informed her that we had used the rafts the day before, and agreed they were in bad shape, but that we didn't mind, we would like to use them anyway. She refused. I then told her that i had brought my own raft, it was in the car, could I use mine. Absolutely not , I was told , NO OUTSIDE toys or rafts allowed. After speaking with the assistant general manager of the hotel, we were allowed to use their rafts for the day.Sunday-the rafts have left the building. No rafts to be had! I figured that was okay.As the day wore on we noticed how crowded it was getting at the pool, it appeared to be local families, all with 5 or more children and ALL were bringing their own noodles and blow up rings !! I couldn't believe how the rules had CHANGED !I felt like I was at a public pool in Tijuana! We payed good money for our room and I know the owner pays a decent maintenence fee for his timeshare, it is such a shame that the management of this hotel would let it turn into such a mess.The activities listed on the daily calender, never took place. Our teenagers waited in the rec room to participate in the 2:30 ping pong tournament, no one from the hotel ever showed up. Although water aerobics was scheduled that never took place either.I really don't know what the full story about this hotel, I just know that we will never stay here again."
55,305,"Jul 27 2008 	Not Bad At All	I used to drive past the Cancun not really knowing what it was all about,,, with the name and all. But, I did some research and found out it was a timeshare property that had a few other resorts around the west US and one in Mexico. I dug a little deeper and found out how this particular timeshare worked. I really like the concept, so I decided to buy. In a few of my earlier reviews, I wrote about Riviera Beach Resort and Cabo Azul Resort and Spa. Both of these are part of the Monarch Grand Vacation Timeshare Family. This is my first time at the Cancun and it was pretty cool. We were sent to the Tulum building and had a very nice two-bedroom-two-bath Villa with balcony. Our balcony faced the north, and we had a non-obstructed view of all the buildings in Vegas. Although, that won't last for long as 'One Las Vegas', has 2 buildings perched on the lot directly north of the Cancun property and it appears they have 3 more to go. The Cancun itself is upgrading, too. According to the masterplan, there will be 3 more buildings put up to complete the project. It looked like some construction had already begun, but I didn't hear any noise from it. We had a really nice time at the Cancun and will definitely be back."
56,305,"Jul 17 2008 	Loved the pool	Me and my family enjoyed our stay here so much that the Venetian hotel left us wanting. I booked the 2 bedroom suite with 1 King bed, 1queen bed, and 1 queen sofa sleeper for $100 dollars a night. Room included 3 TV's, 2 bathrooms with jacuzzi tubs in each bedroom. The tv's were small 19 inch but the seperate bedrooms made up for it. Also there was a balcony for our room nice sun set. Full kitchen so we saved quite a bit by not eating out all the time. I would definitely stay here again, also I 'm going to recommend it for all my family and friends. Only drawback is you are on the far side of the strip. But it didn't matter to us because we had a rental car. Also internet is $10 dollars per night. Still all and all I loved this resort hotel, so did my kids they had 2 pools one with four slides 2 small 2 large; several hot tubs I was very pleased and would definitely recommend for a family. The main plus was it took us only 2 minutes to get to our room and not 15 minutes like the Venetian because the resort is not a whole city block. Enjoy your stay at this place. I hate to give resorts a review like this because they rip people off but I was pleased with this one for our 2 day stay for the money."
57,305,Jun 19 2008 	Pleasant Experience	We stayed at the Cancun resort in June. I have two small children ages 6 and 2 we had a one bedroom which had ample space and a whirlpool in the master bedroom. Our room had a view of the pool which was beautiful at night. Our room had two bathrooms and a fully equiped kitchen it is about 2 miles from the strip you can drive straight down or you can catch the freeway which is close by. They also provide a shuttle that will drop you off at the tropicana every half hour until midnight. There were a few things that I didnt like they dont clean the rooms everyday and you have to keep asking for extra towels. They provide towels at the pool but you have to return them before you go back to your room. They say the pool is heated but the water was cold for my two year old he kept shaking when he would get in the water. They have quite hours after 10pm so you are not supposed to use the whirlpool in your room after that until 8 am the next morning. Overall though we had a great time the grounds are beautiful and if you have a family the full kitchen really helps there is also a grocery store across the street. The beds are comfortable and I would stay there again.
58,305,"Jun 9 2008	Sweating on the balcony the only place allowed to smoke.	No one bothered to tell us, nor does it state anywhere on the websites that this resort is basically a non smoking resort. There is no smoking in the units ($150 fine if you do) or on the groundswith the exception of your balcony. That might not be quite as bad if you weren't in the middle of the dessert at 100 degrees plus.I never would have booked there if I would have known! Come on, it's Las Vegas!"
59,305,Jun 8 2008 	Great Place to Stay	We loved this resort. We stayed in the Penthouse Suite(1800sq. ft.) it was beautiful. The Pool area was great and the kids loved it. They had water slides in the Pyramid. The Bar/Lounge was convenient and the Food was good and very inexpensive for eating in a hotel. The Concierge folks where very knowledgeable about anything in Las Vegas. There where stores right across the Blvd.
60,305,"Jun 8 2008 	Everything I Knew About Vegas Went Out the Door	I'm much more of an expert than my 4 times in LV would indicate. The reason is because I read up so much on the city that I could tell you almost anything. For example, my family couldn't believe that I could drive around town (my first time) and know exactly where I was and where I was going.Well, I had some opinions about Las Vegas that were totally blown away when I stayed at the Cancun resort for four nights/five days.I'll put it to you this way, from now on, I'm going to try my hardest to stay at Cancun (or similar) when traveling to LV. Yes, you're off strip. Technically you're still on Las Vegas Blvd, but the strip is about 4 miles to the north. But this didn't stop any of us from seeing shows, shopping, or doing all the tourist things that the strip has to offer. in fact, I'd say it was almost easier to do all these things because if you know your way around town, you can get there much quicker (and cheaper) than you can just by going up and down the strip taking a cab or the Duece (bus).One big secret that novice travelers might not know is that you can take side streets to get to the various hotels. In fact, I happened to come across a Las Vegas legend when he was going to his car at one of the hotels, and this would have never happened if I was just out with the lemmings.The pool here is the best we've ever seen or experienced. There are better pools out there, but few would be in Las Vegas and even fewer would be located in a residential setting. In other words, pools better than this cost you money to go... get it? Mandalay Bay would be the only residential pool that I'm aware of that would be comparable, but you'd have to fight their thousands of guests whereas at the Cancun Resort, it's so tranquil that you can literally lie in a hammock and read in the shade. To do anything similar at any other hotel would require that you pay for and reserve one of their cabanas.... but at Cancun, this comes with your stay.I used to manage a waterpark, and the water slides here were enough to get me to swim in their pools. The high slide was the fast kind and surprisingly long relative to other slides of its genre at different parks. This is also included with your stay. Many of us rode the waterslide and we ranged from about 22 yrs old to about 55+ yrs old. This would be fun for kids and adults alike.The Cancun is located just across from a grocery anchored retail center. The grocery store is Food4Less and I've generally found their name suitable to their prices.A little ways down the street (maybe another block) is a gigantic strip mall complete with fast food, casual dining (Chipotle, Chilis), steak (Outback) and outlet malls (Tommy, etc).You will feel happy that you get to eat well locally. The food is also cheaper than what you pay on the strip... I know this for fact because I did a price comparison at the same restaurants.For 3 nights we were in a basic 2 room suite. I had the smaller of the two rooms and it was adequate. Our bed happened to be a bit uncomfortable, but the other bed in the suite was nice. The final night we stayed in a presidential suite. It was perhaps about 1500 SQFT complete with large screen TV, Bose sound system and each room was equiped with enormous jetted tubs. The two room standard also had a large jetted tubs, but the presidential ones were larger.In fact, the master bathroom had a tub approximately 330 gallons big. I'd guess you could fit 3 people in it fairly easily... but don't get any ideas, I didn't do that! ;-)They have a pool hall &amp; business center, but I didn't really check out the additional ammentities.Cancun's poolside drinks were reasonably priced ($5 for a mixed drink) and the whole family enjoyed a board game sitting pool side in the shade. Yes, such a thing can happen at Cancun (but don't try this at your local strip hotel because it will never work).All in all, I think I was spoiled by this experience and from now on, I will be looking to stay off strip. It's soooooooooo much better! You can actually enjoy the best of both words by staying in a place like Cancun... luxurious and quiet (not even the people at Four Seasons in LV get this) and 5-10 minutes from the center of the strip via a car.... BONUS REVIEW:In all of Las Vegas, their pools close alarmingly early (7pm). They want you out the pool and out spending money. At Cancun, the pool hours are extended to 10 pm. There's nothing better than swimming on a warm night. It's my favorite time to swim!Second, if you're into waterslides, I'll tell you how to get the most velocity out of them. It's all about body position. Like I said, I worked at one and had a lot of time on my hands in my younger days to figure out the optimal way to ride. To achieve maximum velocity, you want to lie as flat as possible and then arch your back slightly so that your weight is supported by your heels and your shoulder blade area. WIthout that extra friction from your torso, you will absolutely fly... in the pictures, you will see my brother riding normally and then you will see me. The difference is that when I exit the the tube, I'm going so fast that I literally launch to the other side of the pool where the steps are. My brother (and everyone else that goes a normal speed) stops about 10 to 15 feet from the stairs... Enjoy your stay at the Cancun Resort!!!!"
61,305,"Jun 7 2008	Wow!	This resort is great! It is on the south side of Las Vegas Blvd. about a mile from the strip. It is incredibly quiet and relaxing. There are about 6 hot tubs, an enormous pool with waterslides and hammocks everywhere. If you are looking for a relaxing getaway, this is it! After the hustle and bustle of walking through all of the foot traffic on the strip, it is WONDERFUL to come back to the peace and quiet at Cancun Villas. Our room had two bedrooms, two enormous bathrooms, a kitchen, dining room and living area. There is a grocery store down the road (Vons) so it was easy to eat in. I would only make one recommendation if you decide to stay here...you will need a vehicle to get around! Otherwise, your only access to the strip would be the hotel shuttle."
62,305,"May 28 2008 	Loved Cancun!!!!!	We booked this place through an exchange with my timeshare. I stayed here for a week with my bridal party for my wedding and it couldn't have been any better. The place is fabulous. The room was great and clean (we stayed in a 2 br suite). They provided a crib for my 1 year old. The pool was wonderful and really relaxing. It was enough room for me and the 5 girls that stayed with me. About 10 minutes from the strip and they provide a free shuttle. So it was close, but still far enough from the craziness. There's a grocery store right across the street which was great for stocking up on food and drinks. Overall, loved the place and would definitely stay here again!"
63,305,"May 10 2008 	Wished we could stay longer!	We only stayed one night as we were in town for a wedding, but from the time we checked in which was about 4 hours early, they were great. Marco was great on the phone and equally helpful in person. He even called to let us know the room was ready and told us about the pool pass. Our room was a 2 bedroom and was very clean and well taken care. The whole resort appeared as if it was well maintained. Everyone we had contact with seemed friendly and helpful. We had breakfast in the Cafe by the pool and it was great, lots of food and tasty. The pool is awesome. The only problem I could see was if your in Vegas for the action this might be a little far, especially in traffic, since we were not it did not matter. I would love to come back with friends just to relax around the pool!! Thanks Marco and Nicholas!"
64,305,"May 6 2008 	Best pool !	Cancun Resort has a very lovely, large pool complete with waterslides. The water temperature is nice and warm. The pool is huge -- you can literally float on an air mattress and not bump into anyone (very relaxing). If you want some peace and relaxation - this is the place. Plenty of lounge chairs, situated in small, private groupings. We never had difficulty finding a chair at any time of the day. The 1 bedroom room was nice and clean. It had a spacious balcony. My only criticism is the carpet could be replaced, it wasn't dirty or stained, but showing it's age. The master bath had a 2 person jetted bath tub. Cancun resort also has a shuttle to the strip (we never used this service). In comparison to a larger &quot;strip&quot; resort, this was much easier to navigate and less stressful. Each building had it's own small covered parking lot, finding your vehicle was super easy. The pool was only a few steps from the elevator. Not all the crazy walking like the larger highrise resorts.We had an enjoyable stay. This is a timeshare property - we purchased by the night through expedia, with no sales seminar required."
65,305,"May 3 2008 	Great - Only if you don't want to go to the strip	We were excited when we first arrived even with the complete apathy of the staff at the front desk and frank rudeness at the package gift counter. The pool area is very nice (exceptionally well kept) as was our room (old but clean). We arrived on a Wednesday with very few people in house and was the only day we were able to use the shuttle without incident.Shuttle does not start until Noon and ends at 12:15am. It is supposed to run every 20 minutes. It never did - we ended up spending a fortune in cab rides. Our last night becuase of an inept driver it took us nearly 11/2 hours to make the 4 mile trip. We were there for the last shuttle and the same driver shrugged - the bus was filled up and he was not coming back. If you are not planning on going to the strip or have a car and don't mind paying for the parking at the strip, it's a clean place to stay with a nice pool area.One really big positive was the surprisingly great day Spa. If you decide to stay here anyway, make sure you hit the spa- Cindy was fantastic."
66,305,Apr 28 2008 	Great place to stay!	this is a great place to stay. we got a great rate through Expedia and it was well worth it. The grounds and pool were beautiful and my 10 yr old loved the waterslides. My only complaint would be that there was no kiddie pool. I have a 14 month old and there was no place for her to play. The room was spacious and clean and the staff was friendly. I will definitely return.
67,305,"Apr 25 2008 	Excellent Resort!	We stayed at the Cancun Resort during April this year. We had a 2 bedroom suite, and the rooms were clean and spacious, and the decor very nice. The hotel itself has beautiful grounds and an amazing pool, which is heated. It is not on the strip but that did not bother us one bit, as it was just a short 5 minute drive to the strip. It is perfect for a relaxing stay.We had a wonderful time at the Cancun and in Vegas and would definately consider staying here again!"
68,305,"Apr 21 2008 	Paid for a 2 bdr at the last minute given a 1bdr.	The company Las Vegas Getaways hooked me up with Monarch Resorts-Cancun resort in Las Vegas Nevada through a radio promotion. Las Vegas Getaways called me on a Sunday the day of my Wedding after I told them what day to call. Then they put me through to the Cancun resort to make and pay for the reservation. At that point I paid for a 2 bdr suite, this was back in Feb, now 2 days before the reservation i get an email confirming a 1 bdr. I call both the resort and Las Vegas Getaways and I'm told that they can give me my money back but that is all they can do. At this point it is to late for me to make alternate reservations, so I pretty much have to take it up the u know what."
69,305,"Apr 20 2008 	great!	This is a great resort for a fairly low price. It is at the far south end of Las vegas Blvd (the strip). We discovered, thanks to GPS, it is much quicker to get on I-15 than to drive up and down the strip. The resort was very clean. Check in was a breeze. They let us check in a few hours before check in. The pool and surrounding area are immacuate!! The suites are a little small but adequate. We had a two bedroom two bath. Both have whirlpoool tubs and they both worked well. We used the very large balcony daily and nightly. We had a view of the mountains. The sunrise and sunset were dramatic! Everything in our suite was clean. They say no daily housekeeping, but we had it daily without asking. Very friendly staff for the most part. The concierge could be more helpful. She stared at her computer for 2 minutes before acknowledging my presence. Overall, great place to stay and will return."
70,305,"Apr 10 2008 	Great stay at the Cancun	My sister and I rented a two bedroom suite and were very surprised by the size. It was huge. One bedroom had a king size bed with ensuite that was huge and the other bedroom had a queen size bed and the bathroom was located just outside the bedroom and was also very large. Both bathrooms had jacuzzi tubs. We took advantage of the Food 4 Less store which is located just a 5 minute walk from the resort and bought everything we needed for breakfast and we went there and bought our dinner one night. We had the best roasted chicken from their deli we had ever had. The pool area was fabulous and the hotel staff are very attentive and polite. It reminds you of a hotel resort down in the Caribbean. If you stay less than 5 days you do not get daily maid service unless you want to pay for it, but they do come in and change the towels and take the garbage out daily. We found the shuttle service quite good and the drivers were very friendly. If I had any criticisms it would be that the furnishing in our room were a bit out dated and you could not open the dishwasher door to put your dishes in unless you opened up the refrigerator door. Overall it was a fantastic stay and great bargain. We both decided that we would definitely stay there again, but would ask for a room overlooking the pool area."
71,305,"Apr 6 2008 	Loved it!	After reading some of the reviews I was a little bit apprehensive. I loved the place and our stay wasn't long enough. The pool was great, the hot tubs even better and the fact that the place had slides was even more awesome. Our room was clean, had two bathrooms and a pull out sofa. It easily slept 5! A bigger plus was that the building we stayed in was energy saving! yes.. so if you are energy concious, this is very comforting (note* yes I do know that nothing about las vegas is enery saving) We took the shuttle a few times and the drivers were friendly and when we walked around the staff/maintenance greeted us every time! My son and I ate breakfast at the Coba Cafe, which in the pyramid and it was great! He got two pig pancakes, a THREE egg omelette, hashbrowns, a big piece of ham and hot cocoa! He couldnt eat it all and had enough to take back some to his cousin who got full too! the only drawbacks were, is that some of the pool staff was young, and were more interested in their freinds than working. but that is teenagers for you! We drove across to the food 4 less and bought groceries which was great! There is also a 1 buck movie rental machine in there if you want to go that route and have a movie night The shuttle did get full at the end of the evening when everyone was trying to get on the last shuttle back. the fare was only 14 bucks from the MGM (which is the first/last stop on the monorail) to the resort, which is okay for me! II am going back soon, when it is warmer to stay at the pool all day.. (they had activities planned for young children!!) There is even an observation deck on one of the buildings that I didn't get too. and I dont want to forget the best part.. the bathtubs!! Both rooms had jacuzzi tubs! So if you want relaxing then this is the place to stay, its quiet, clean, and pretty. and then you can go out and party all night at the strip!"
72,305,"Mar 22 2008 	A rather so/so experience	Overall the property was decent, but there were a few things that I was unimpressed with.First, our room had no air conditioning. Turning the A/C on would result in the heat coming on, and since this was Spring Break, management had no other rooms to offer us. We resorted to just opening the windows, which made things bearable.The other was the shuttle to the Strip. It ran from Noon-Midnight, stopping at the resort and at the Tropicana every 30 minutes. There was only one shuttle running with about 15 seats on it. Keep in mind again that this was Spring Break and many times there were people left behind by the shuttle because it didn't run often enough to accomodate everyone. Cab fare to and from the various casinos on the Strip ranged from 20-30 dollars, so that was an expensive option.Having the shuttle stop at the Tropicana was also a bit inconvenient, as the Tropicana is located at the far south end of the Strip.Overall, it was a decent place to stay, but I will be staying somewhere on the Strip or with better shuttle service on my next trip to Las Vegas."
73,305,"Mar 19 2008 	peaceful restful vegas	Ok I was concerned about going to Las Vegas for my son's wedding. I had a little bronchitis and didn't relish breathing smoke so we stayed at the Cancun. Woke up on a beautiful sunny day went out by the pool and heard the sounds of waterfalls and birds. 2 bedroom suite with comfortable pull out sofa so a total of 5 people slept in the suite (says slept 6 but my son is over 6 ft). Approx a mile from the strip. I rented a car but the cabs make frequent runs. Very family friendly: jacuzzi, waterslides, game room billiards, patio, across the street from the library. Out let mall in the next block. 7-11 in the next block for a slurpee fix. Room had 1 king and the other room had 2 double beds. bathrooms very large each had a jucuzzi tub and shower. Very clean. Carpet was worn funiture drab but clean and very reasonably priced . Did go to the casisnos and as I predicted was very uncomfortable due to the smokes impact on my breathing."
74,305,"Mar 3 2008	Excellent highly recommend it	Great value for the price. Fairly new, so smells good. Clean, roomy, nice furniture. Its a suite with kitchen, dining room and living room. 3/4 bathroom off living room with a folding wall to separate off the living room so it can be used as an extra bedroom. 1 bedroom unit can sleep 4, 2 bedroom unit can sleep 6. No gambling so nice and quiet. Highly recommended."
75,305,"Feb 18 2008 	great family-friendly place	My family stayed at this resort as timeshare owners. We had a 7 month old child, and 70-yar old grandparents with us. The staff was very friendly at check-in. The 2 bedroom suite had a kitchen with stove and refrigerator, living room with pull-out sofa, and dining room. The suite was clean, and the bathrooms generous. The rooms were large enough that we could fit a portable crib at one side. The pool area was clean and had a slide. Our group had great fun hanging out at the pool area. The snack bar had good food to choose from. It is not in the middle of the Strip, but there is shuttle service going to and from the main area of the Strip. The spa was small, and it did not make efforts to conceal clutter of lotions, so it was not as relaxing as it could have been. My only criticisms are that the bathtubs were very deep for older people to step in and out of, the latch on the balcony door was difficult to use and we thought we were locked out once, and the sofabed could not be left open during the day or else it blocked the whole living room."
76,305,"Feb 18 2008 	Loved it only one small problem already booked again for this year.	We stayed here for 5 days during Spring Break of 07. Reserved through a hotel internet site, not as part of a time share. This was our first stay at a non-casino hotel, so we weren't sure how we would like it. It was really a nice place for us. We brought our young son who loved the pool and waterslides. On our first day, we went grocery shopping and spent about $35 (for 3) for breakfast and lunch food for the whole stay, which was great. We spent mornings at the pool, ate lunch back in the room, then went &quot;out&quot; in the afternoon/evenings. So we saved a lot, only buying one restaurant meal a day. Still had lots of &quot;gambling time&quot;. They have a complimentary shuttle, but it was always full, so we just took our own car . They should probably have more frequent shutles, although we were there during a busy week. We had the one bedroom last time, which was great. The kitchen was fully functional with full size stove, fridge etc. I don't understand the comments about the kitchen being small? I thought it was great for a hotel/time share? The carpet was a little worn, so hopefully they are working on replacing it. There are sliding shutters so you can close off the living room for privacy as a second bedroom, and still access the kitchen, so that was nice. Otherwise, yeah it was a little &quot;dark&quot; if you had the shutters closed, but it is decorated in those colors, tans/browns etc. so why don't people just open their shutters and let some light in? We had the slider open a lot, with a little balcony to sit on, it was very nice. We had no problems with bugs, dirty linens, trash etc. So not sure where these other travelers stayed? It was very clean and a really nice place for our family. We had one small problem with a maintenence man who chased my 8 year-old son and myself out of a jacuzzi because the capacity was exceeded, although the majority of the occupants were kids about 3 years old who were in there with their parents. The sign clearly indicated no kids under 6 ( I think that was the age). But since we were the last to get it, he kicked us out instead of all of the underage kids?? So we went to the next jacuzzi (there are many), and he followed and kicked us out of that on too, saying it was an &quot;adults only&quot;. Ugh!! That was frustring and I did complain to management, although I would say that they didn't seem too interested in my complaint? But otherwise, we had a nice time and are staying again next month for Spring Break 08, this time in a two bedroom. I would recommend to anyone for the price."
77,305,"Jan 14 2008 	Fantasic value! Very happy!	Our AAA travel agent found this for our Vegas stay. What a pleasant surprise! We were very happy with it and felt we got excellent value. This place is now on the the top of my list of places to stay in Las Vegas.The room was great. It had a fully stocked kitchen, a dining room, a living room, a bedroom with a huge comfortable bed, and an enormous on-suite bathroom. The bathroom featured a jacuzzi tub. There is also another bathroom with shower off the living room.The staff were friendly, courteous, and efficient.it is a 10 minute drive down LV Blvd from The Strip. If you are driving in LV, then this is a great deal. You can drive up to the hotels on the strip and part for free up there.I did not get a chance to walk around the grounds, or try out their pool, etc. But being the middle of January and cold outside, it was not an issue."
78,305,"Jan 13 2008 	Great Place to Stay	Stayed here with my husband and two kids, in a one bedroom condo unit. I was very skeptical after reading the reviews posted here and I must say all the bad reviews this resort has received are all nonsense. We checked in on Sunday, early evening, and was welcomed with warm chocalate chip cookies and many smiling faces We got to our room and called for a rollaway, but they do not provide them, so the kind front desk staff offered to have extra bedding and an egg crate mattress brought to our room. The room was very clean and amenties were just as stated on the resorts website. The extereior and common areas of the resort were always clean and I felt very safe letting our 10 year old daughter walk the grounds with her 13year old brother each night.The pool was a lot of fun for the kids, they had three of the waterslides open and a lifeguard is on duty the whole time the pool is open.We ate dinner in the Caribe Lounge one night and the food was very tasty(no foreign object of any kind), and the staff hlepful and friendly.Every evening the kids would go to the club house and play pool for a couple of hours.We will definitely be staying there again."
79,305,"Jan 12 2008 	Simply a nice place	We've been to Vegas so many times and stayed at different strip hotels but our last 2 winter visits were booked in this resort via Monarch Resorts. The place is about 3-5 miles to the strip which is a good thing as it limits your time in the casino (remember, you will lose 9 of 10 times you gamble) and enables you to explore the other Vegas and do other stuff, like shopping in the nearby Belz factory outlet or visiting Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.The resort is well maintained. Our 1 bedroom 2 bath suite was clean and the king bed was comfortable The living room had a sleeper sofa. The suite was located on the ground floor of the rear left building and there were ample outdoor parking. The wifi connection was really strong (Youtube loaded quick) and rate was about $10 a day or $19 for 3 days. If you have no laptop there were PCs available in the recreation room which also had 4 pool tables and 2 pingpong tables. Front desk was friendly and room service was prompt. Heating was OK. There were complimentary cookies and water at the reception area. Shuttles to and from the strip (Tropicana) ran past midnight. Since it was winter and the low temps were in the 30s, the swimming pools were closed but I saw kids in the heated jacuzzis. Housekeeping was very limited (once a week?) so re-use your towels (call room service to request fresh ones) and throw your garbage in the bins located in the basement parking. The self-service baggage trolleys were quite helpful.The advantage of a timeshare suite versus the hotel is having the kitchen which allows you to wake up late and eat in (kitchen small but functional.) This is not only convenient but also economical. We loaded up on groceries at the Food 4 Less across the street for $50 and that took care of our breakfasts, snacks and brunches for 4 days. Next to Food 4 Less were restaurants and stores including Starbucks and Panda Express. The only complaint we had have was the noise from the sliding door caused by howling wind one night that was really loud in the living room. But then we were too sleepy to care.Two Vegas tips: traffic is always heavy on the strip so remember these two side streets: Koval and Paradise. If you are into buffet and gambling bargain deals, buy a coupon book (check out Las Vegas Advisor's $37 book that has plenty of 2 for 1 offerings.)Have a winning Vegas trip, baby."
80,305,"Jan 9 2008 	Great place to stay!	This is a great place to stay in Las Vegas. It has everything you need and would want in your room. Far enough from the strip to get a break, but only takes 3-5 min to be right back in the middle of the strip. Great pool for young and old."
81,305,"Dec 19 2007 	Great place!	We have stayed at this resort approximately five times now. It is one of our favorite resorts to visit for a getaway in Las Vegas. Every time we have been there, our room/villa was impeccably clean, the guest service was prompt with extra towels or whatever we requested. The pool, of course, is a great feature. But I really enjoy the on-site spa for relaxing. They have massage therapists that are really exceptional.I will recommend this place to all who ask."
82,305,"Nov 19 2007 	Learn some customer service please	On our second night there I woke up at 2:30am to go to the bathroom. When I turned on the lights there were cockroaches everywhere in my bathroom and my bedroom. They were even crawling on my suitcase. I ran through the villa waking up everyone and turning on lights. The front desk told me to come down and get started on paperwork for a new room. No apology, no nothing. We got a new room, which was smelly, dirty, and faced the parking lot. My cockroach room at least had a nice poolside/courtyard view. Refused the room and was told there was nothing else he could do for me until the manager arrived at 9am. Mind you it was about 4am now and that meant sitting around for 5 hours. There were 5 of us girls who went away for a &quot;girls weekend&quot; and now in our pajamas with hardly any sleep we were stuck to wait in the lobby until 9am. I suppose we could have gone back to our cockroach room, or the dirty new room but considering the money we spent I felt we deserved better. We got kicked out of the lobby by security at 6:30am because the hotel didn't want people checking out or checking in to see us. We went to breakfast and Walmart to kill time and buy one of the girls some new clothes. I realize this was her choice, but she had a full blown anxiety / panic attack when she saw the roaches on her things. She left 75% of her belongings in the cockroach room because she could not even handle bringing them home with her. She spent $100 at Walmart to get through the last 2 days of our trip. When we got back we were given a long overdue apology, 1 free meal for all 5 of us at the cafe on the grounds (which served sandwiches and frys), no compensation to my friend who bought new clothes, and the best of all... another 3 hour wait out by the hotel pool in our pajamas while we waited for people to check out so we could get ANOTHER new room! I will never go back here, nor will any of my friends. For the price that we paid and the fact that our building was a time share I thought we would not have had any problems. I am extremely disappointed with how our situation was handled. The disrespect we were shown from the front desk, the nonchalant attitude the manager took with us, and the lack of compensation for our inconvenience and experience screams of poor management. Next time I will handle my own arrangements because when I phoned Expedia for assistance I spent most of 90 minutes on hold only to be told that they could not do anything until the manager arrived either. Of course they could have found us a new hotel, but we would have had to pay for it. In my experience a well run business should always have someone on duty who can make decisions to alleviate a problem, no matter what time of day it is. I guess we can all chalk it up to &quot;live and learn&quot;. I will be following other travelers advice more closely and sticking with &quot;big name&quot; hotels in Vegas. I took pictures of the roaches as proof, and would be happy to email photos."
83,305,"Nov 5 2007 	Very Nice Resort / Clean / Quiet / Asteticly Pleasing	I really enjoyed my stay at the Cancun Resort. I really don't have a whole lot more to say than what previous positive reviewers have said.. I had just read a few bad reviews before my visit and I just want to set the record straight that this place is far from being a dump. The The condos were very nice and I loved the furnishings. The Pool was nicely landscaped with plenty of little private shaded nooks throughout the property. Loved the free pool rafts and hammocks. Everyting you need is on site.. The convience store had just about anything an travler would be looking for. It was very easy to get the the strip Casinos... Just pull out of the driveway onto Las Vegas Blvd and drive north about 4 miles. Don't except the same sort of service you would get at a Four Seasons Resort... This is one of those timeshare's that is not like a hotel resort.. So you must critique it that way. As a timeshare, it is one of the nicest I've stayed in. Overall, my stay was a very comfortable one. They did have a sports bar by the pool that stayed open until 10:00PM that also serves food.I do recommend a car since this resort is a bit away from public transportation... I enjoyed staying somewhere without a Casino since I was there for an entire week, it really didn't matter."
84,305,"Nov 2 2007 	Superior Resort - Best Experience Ever In Vegas	This is a Winner and deserves a much higher rating (atleast 25 points higher). Highly Recommended! We just returned from the Monarch Cancun Resorts in Vegas and it was the best experience at any resort we've ever had. The room was very clean/sanitized, the service was excellent and the Cancun people were super nice. The customer service by the entire staff made our stay very enjoyable and relaxing.Excellent Excellent Excellent - the room (two bedroom in the newer wing) was as good as any resort we've visited in the last 10 years and it was very clean. The beds were very comfortable. We stayed in the newer wing section (Building 5). Yes, we were skeptical on what to expect because of some of the negative reviews that we read in trip advisor, but we were pleasantly suprised at the excellent room. Excellent - Pool, Game room and bar service. I especially enjoyed relaxing in the poos and jacuzzis.We can't wait to return."
85,305,"Oct 3 2007 	Awesome!!!	After I planned this exchange I went on line to check out the site. I found some of the uncomplimentary reviews and began to worry. Well I want to put anyone's mind to rest who has the same thoughts. This resort is awesome. It is off the strip and thus quiet. The staff were always attentive and helped us whenever we asked. Our 2 bedroom unit was spotless, well equiped and we actually used the kitchen and 2 of us were in there at once. Everything that I needed was stocked in the kitchen and there is a Food 4 Less right across the street for supplies.The one hard thing was transportation. There is no shuttle from the airport so you need to get a cab, or one of the CTS (?) airport shuttles. There is a CanCun shuttle which takes you to the Tropicana, and the South Point Shuttle also comes by. There is a trolley which comes by fairly often and you can get a day pass $4.25 or a night pass $4.25 but you have to transfer several times and it can be time consuming. If you aren't on a schedule it is very easy to get around. Leave plenty of time tho if you have a time schedule. The pool was beautiful. There was always somewhere to sit and they had good towels and a nice little store for sundries and souveniers (fair prices). They had lifegaurds there until 10 PM. A couple of the hot tubs were a little cool, and I would have liked the hot tubs to be open later. The restaurant is fairly generic, but we had room service several times and the food was great. I had a salmon dinner which was one of the best I have ever had.  The concierge was helpful and had answers to all our questions. The front desk staff were welcoming and check in and check out was a breeze. The lounge is well staffed and has food available later than the restaurant. The bartenders are all great. There is a exercise room and a full service Day Spa. Both are on site and it isn't hard to get an appointment. Each building has available guest washing facilities. We were in the main building, which is the oldest building and had a view directly towards the pool. The room and resort were so comfortable and relaxing that we spent alot of time right there. One other item that people complained about was the A/C and ours was great. The spa tubs were wonderful and there was ample hot water to actually use them. ALL IN ALL it was a wonderful resort, wonderful staff and I would go again in a heart beat."
86,305,"Sep 18 2007 	Enjoyed but understand the bad reviews	We just returned from our stay at the Cancun resort. First of all, Im a very easy person to please and I can understand why this resort has gotten all the bad reviews. Ive stayed at two other timeshare resorts which were both immaculate with huge kitchens and washer/dryer in the unit. At the Cancun resort we had a one-bedroom Villa with 2 bathrooms. This Villa was about  of the size of the other resorts weve stayed at. And when you read that only one person can be in the kitchen at a time that is not an exaggeration. The kitchen is very small. This didnt bother us because we never used it anyway. Overall, the villa was clean and comfortable. However, if you are looking for perfection then this is definitely not the place for you. The lampshade in the living room had a huge whole in it. It looked like the light bulb got too hot and burned right through the shade. In the bathroom right off of the living room, it looked like the sink had been ripped from the wall and just placed back and the shower did not even work (the water didnt turn on). In the bathroom off of the bedroom, there were several scuffs on the walls and the towel rack had been ripped off of the wall and was just lying on the floor (wholes in the wall were it used to be). It seems they would have attempted to fix all of these issues before the next guest arrived. With all that said, we didnt spend much time in the room anyway and the swimming pool area was fabulous!!! The pool was very clean and very spacious. I always found a lounge chair to lie in and always got a raft when I wanted it. We never had a problem parking although underground parking was limited. We would definitely return because we liked the location (off the strip), unit was clean, and pool area was wonderful."
87,305,"Aug 6 2007 	horrible disgrace!	I TRADED IN HERE through interval international....DO NOT waste your week like we did. this place is a disgrace ! garbage all over the elevator floors all week and garbage all over the garage level all week also! there was no toilet paper or tissues or soap in the rooms. we were in the newest building and the lampshade was torn, the carpet was filthy and full of holes. they never came for the mid week cleaning as promised, so we called and they charged us $50. for the cleaning! the pool was ice cold. this place does not deserve 1 star it is awful. i turned the knob on the sink and the knob fell off! the outlet did not work for the hair dryer and maintenance could not fix it either! What a horrible disappointment. do not be fooled by the interval rating, listen to the people that actually stayed here. i wish i listened to all the bad comments before i wasted my week here! knick knacks are glued to the shelf in the unit and evidently were broken and since they were glued down you now have the remaining broken piece permanantly attached to the shelf. HORRIBLE DISGRACE, STAY FAR AWAY!!!"
88,305,"Jul 9 2007 	This does not deserve any Stars	It is impossible to comprehend how Interval International, with whom we arranged our exchange, could give this Resort a 5 Star rating.The entire resort is untidy, bordering on dirty and unkempt. The air conditioning and water systems are decrepit and noisey. The service level provided by the employees is casual to say the least. Our unit was advertised for six people but the sleeping accommodation was not large enough for sleeping six adults due to the limited available space and absence of sufficient storage space for clothing. The kitchen area was far too small and not sufficiently equipped for six people. When the inventory was checked numerous items were missing and not replaced when requested. There were strange artificial plants dotted about which were dusty, had pieces falling off and took up too much space. The furniture was old and I have seen better in a charity shop. The blinds did not close properly and let in light from the balcony light which came on automatically every evening and could not be turned off. The linen and towels had definitely seen better days.After our first night there we had to change rooms because we could not sleep due to the noisy air conditioning and water rushing through the pipes. We were told by a completely disinterested member of staff at 3am there was nothing they could do about it and speak to the manager in the morning! They obviously thought that if they were awake why shouldn't we be!!The second room was no better because 2 people could not sleep in the lounge area due to the noise again from the a/c and the fridge/freezer.Both of our rooms were in the Merida building which we were told was a new block, god knows what the inside of an old block is like.During the weekend we were there the resort was very crowded due to the fact the hotel seems to issue day passes to people to use the pool. Rules for behaviour around the pool and in the public areas are disregarded by these visitors and not enforced by the local management. The pool access gates were never locked and so the pool was open to all comers as well as paying guests.The underground parking is fine but there are only limited number of spaces under each block and when they are gone - the car fries. The lock on the security door from the underground parking in the Merida building was broken so any non resident could access the inside of block without having to use a pass key.We checked in on 1 June for a week but left after 3 nights and went to the Marriott Chateau. It cost us big bucks but we did not fly nearly 11 hours across the Pond to stay in this kind of hotel it would have completely ruined our week."
89,305,"Jun 27 2007 	Money Spent On Pool....Not Rooms...	This place is nice from the pics posted on the Interval website, though upon arriving and after inquiring we found out the room pics on the site are of the Penthouse Suite, not their regular rooms.We stayed in building 4 the Yuccatan (aptly named). The place is a dump! They appeared to have spent all of their funds on the pool area and left the rooms alone.To begin with, there is no a/c working in the elevators, for the whole week not a bit of a/c in any of them. Of course when you took the elevator to view the penthouse suite on the presentation that a/c worked just fine.The room is billed on Interval has having a kitchen, it should be a LK instead of K. The kitchen is extremely small, only large enuf for one person at a time, and if someone wants in the frig or oven you have to step out of it so they can open the door. The dishwasher rack was broken, the door that holds in the powders wouldnt stay shut. There was very few utensils, plates, bowls, etc in a place that is suppose to accomodate 6 people. Basic kitchen supplies like soap had not been restocked. Food under the kitchen table, someone did not vacuum under there.The living room was lacking furniture again for a place that says it will accomodate 6 people, had 1 chair and 1 small couch. The place is very dark, whoever put in the canister lights in the ceiling put them all 3 in a row on one side of the rooms only in each room leaving the rest of the room dark. The master rooms mind blinds had weights on the strings from where they had been retied so much, the strings were off the slats and they didnt close completely which left it very bright in there at night cause there is a huge light right outside the window that comes on at night that you cannot turn off! The master is small with a king bed, though seems more of a queen size to us but the night stands are huge things with huge clunky lamps and lampshades from a gone by era that take up most of the room. A corner ent.center takes up what little space is left. The shower is awful, its large, largest I've ever seen though didnt matter when opening a Pepsi gets you more pressure than this shower has, you have to stand directly under it to feel anything and I'm sure a few days I never got wet at all..The bathrooms are extremely long though for what reason we dont know, it was just wasted space that could of been used for the kitchen, bedroom, anywhere else really. They have huge fake plants sitting around that take up lots of room, we moved all of those to a corner, they added nothing to the decor and were oddly sitting in the strangest places where they were directly hindering you trying to walk to rooms. A ceiling fan when you first enter the room is great, but why not put any in the rooms or living room? You can only turn the heat/ac to off or on, low, med, or high. No picking a temp you'd like and just set it and forget it. A lot of mirrors, if you're into that you wont be disappointed. They put them above each bed, in the hallways to the bedrooms and in the eating area behind the kitchen table. Why is anybodys guess. None of us were keen on watching ourselves eating in the mirror...lolThere are no baking pans, only a couple old pots and pans that are not non stick and 2 sizes of pyrex dishes, thats it. We had to wash utensils just so someone else could eat, and there are no drawers in the kitchen, all of the utensils are up in the cabinets, thats how small this kitchen is...no dang drawers..LOLI would not recommend this place. If you can avoid it, please do at all costs. On the other hand, all of their money has gone into the pools and waterslides area which I was told is very nice, I didnt personally go check them out.If you like dark, dingy and most things broken or not working then this is definately the place for you."
90,305,Jun 27 2007 	Enjoyed...Hope to Return!	We went to the Cancun Resort and I must say we enjoyed it very much. After reading a few reviews I was a little skeptical about how the trip was going to turn out. When we got there we walked the property to see what was going on and we were pleased 2 c the grounds were and clean. The concierge was very friendly and knowledgable of what to do for the nightlife. The Caribu Lounge had pretty good drinks. The rooms were private and it felt like home away from home. What we enjoyed the most was the jacuzzi with the complimentary hammock under the trees. Even though the weather was scorchin' it was still enjoyable. The Strip was only about 10 minutes away by car. There is free parking which is great depending on what end of the strip you want to be on. To sum it all up We enjoyed our visit and plan on going back.
91,305,"May 11 2007 	LOVED IT	We are owners of this resort via timeshare..After reading some of the reviews I didn't know what to expect but after we spend a week there for our 36th Anniversary, I wonder if the people writing the bad reviews stayed at the same hotel.....We had a beautiful room, Wonderful friendly service, staff and a fabulous time....I will stay at this resort every time I go to Vegas. My husband and I travel alot both in our RV and at our Time shares and this in one of the Best......I can only give it 10 stars in every catagory......"
92,305,"May 10 2007 	Not a 5 Star Resort	We were there 4/29-5/06 had 2 seperate two bedroom units. Overall we were 8 people. The resort is pretty far from the strip which can be a plus or neg. depending on your funds for gambling. I have to agree with the previous reviews of the rooms looking dreadful. It is VERY true. It's very dark, depressing and not mexican at all. The furniture looks like it was picked up at a yard sale in need of lots of TLC. The kitchen is super small, the only plus is the bathrooms. They are huge, they probably could have cut them in half and made bigger closets. The closets are teenie tiny. The food in the cafe is descent, priced okay. The place does not have a business center that lets you use a computer and printer. The major complaint was that the shuttle service realy sucks. They're tiny shuttle vans some with working a/c that only seat 13 people. Everytime we went to get in line there was already about 10 if not more waiting; so we'd get a cab, which we always had to get 2 cabs. Pricey if you multiply this times 7 days. The worst is trying to get a shuttle for the airport. I had to call about 8 different shuttle companies to hire a bus. 99% of them don't go outside the strip so do your homework before you go if it's a big party.I think the tahiti village looked alot better."
93,305,"Apr 20 2007	The pictures don't lie	If you view the pics of the resort on the web you will not be disppointed upon arriving. The rooms are spacious and the view from the balcony of the desert, outstanding. It feels nothing like the usual &quot;hotel&quot; experience. The kitchen is a nice touch. The only thing I disliked was the shower. The water would leak onto the tile floor of the restroom because there is no shower curtain. That weekend was too windy for a swim but the pool is great especially for children. We ate at the bar and the food was reasonably priced. The staff was helpful in assisting me when I locked myself out of the room. This place is very family friendly and great. Even though your a short drive from the strip and we had a car the resort does provide shuttle service."
94,305,"Apr 8 2007 	Spacious well-appointed apartment-like suites. Great for family travel.	We got booked at the Cancum resort because Travelocity screwed up a previous reservation at a different Las Vegas hotel. I don't recommend ever using Travelocity again, but in this case, I'm glad we got to stay at the Cancun.It's about 3 miles due south from the southend of the Strip so you need a car. You need a car anyway, if you're planning to do any significant tours of the Strip. The hotel is made up of apartment suites and has something like 4-6 separate buildings (I can't remember the exact number). The theme is mayan, and there's a parklike area in the middle with a mockup of a big mayan temple and a water slide. Great way to keep the kids entertained. We got one of the one-bedroom suites (they have two-bedroom ones as well). It had a small full kitchen, one dining room area, one living room area that could convert into it's own bedroom, and the master bedroom. There are two bathrooms, one off the master bedroom that is gigantic with a whirlpool bathtub, and another one off the living room/2nd bedroom. I can't remember the exact price I paid for it, but I do remember it being quite the steal. Most likely it is a better bargain because it is off the Strip. But if you're going to have a car anyway, why not stay a bit further away and pay a lot less?"
95,305,"Apr 3 2007 	Another great weekend at the Cancun!	We are a member of the Cancun Resort and other properties and love going there. The rooms are great and the people that work there are super friendly and helpful! I like that there is a fully stocked kitchen and tv's in the rooms and living area. The linens are fresh and clean. Our kids love the pool and water slides and the game room gives them some extra activities to do after a long day walking around on the strip. The kids can bring movies to watch and we fill the fridge with lots of snacks for a fun weekend get away. Most of the other guests/members are friendly and we have met other couples and famlies there. We like that it is not right on the strip, because we can relax with our family without all the crazy Vegas atmosphere going on non-stop. After all day or night on the strip coming back to the resort to hang out and relax the until late the next morning is great. The resort offers a shuttle to casinos and cabs are available also. We usually take our own vehicle and valet park it at one of the local casino's on the strip. Casino's will valet park for free, just have to tip the valet.I can't stress enough how great the staff at the Cancun is! They always work with us on any issues and really do a great job to make sure your experience is fun. I say this because when we were checking out, there was a guest that was giving the staff a hard time because they arrived without making reservations and &quot;expecxted&quot; a room. Just because you are a member, does not mean you can just show up when you want. Make reservations ahead of time and be extra polite and they will do anything for you. Knowing the staff, had there been something available I'm sure they would have accomodated this individual."
96,305,"Mar 7 2007 	Details DO Make A Difference	Upon arrival, my husband and I observed the artificial plants / flowers in the planters outside the lobby area. First impression: Low budget property. Our one bedroom &quot;cave&quot; was dark and unappealing. The one bedroom is suitable for two, no more. One of the two sinks in the master bath did not drain, although maintenance attempted to clear the drain. The rack over the toilet in the second bath was not secure, therefore not safe to place toiletries. The bathtowels seemed clean, but stained and worn. We do not recommend margaritas at the Caribe Lounge. A Courtesy Shuttle is available to the strip and Fremont Street. Fremont Street is a must see if you have not experienced it before. The laser light show is at 8:00pm and the street entertainment was good. The Courtesy Shuttle schedule does not pick you up until midnight. We found the 4 hours was too long for our taste, yet if we were gamblers the 4 hours might had gone by quickly. We were shown a 2 bedroom and the Penthouse accomodations. Both were airy and nice..although our decision was not to purchase this time share."
97,305,"Feb 15 2007 	very clean 	Went with family &amp; stayed at this resort.When we arrived I was quite pleased to see a nice well lite reception, which was pleasing to the eye. Our appartment was very large &amp; well equipped with cooker, microwave, kettle,fridge, tv .etc &amp; we had a separate dining area &amp; the views of the strip @ night were amazing. our bedroom was very clean &amp; comfortable &amp; the maids came daily &amp; always replaced comp toiletries. We also had a huge jacuzzi bath.On our 1st day we ordered breakfast ( the works!) from the resorts diner. The food arrived piping hot &amp; lots of it! the fruit smoothies are a must &amp; I ordered a chilli burger @ dinner time to find it was a burger in a bap covered in chilli concarne! different from what we get back in England but was very tasty.The swimming pools &amp; outdoor hot tub was fab. Opposite the reception they have a travel desk, their trips are quite reasonable &amp; the 2 ladies were very helpful.Calls back to the U.K are very expensive so buy a phone card from cancuns machines &amp; use their phone booths &amp; you can call home for a fraction of the price.The resort is quite far away, from the strip. you cant walk it.But dont let that put u off, because the resort do offer a comp shuttle which takes you to the strip &amp; u can jump on &amp; off at different pick up points. Dont take a taxi as they rip you off.They have a fashion outlet on the other side of the road ( resort shuttle stops there) &amp; you can get some great designer bargains.We had a great time here &amp; we also felt very safe &amp; would not hesitate in coming back to this resort in the future."
98,305,"Dec 18 2006 	Awfully depressing rooms!	The room was decorated with very depressing browns and earth tones and the furniture was very hard and uncomfortable. Service was terrible as they don't clean the rooms everyday ( we could tell by the dusty lamps and tables) and we asked for a pillow and we were abruptly told they were all out and hung up on. Maybe okay for families who just want to hang out by the pool in the summer, but for adults looking for something nice, I wouldn't suggest it. Way too far from the strip or a casino to really enjoy Vegas - even if you drive, it's too far out! There's no casino nearby which defeats some of the reason most people go to Vegas I think."
99,305,Nov 11 2006 	Geat value for resort! kitchen is a plus	I LOVE LOVE THE CANCUN RESORT. I have stayed at the location several times. I love the kitchen area and I love the rooms overall. The jacuzzi tub is a plus. Highly recommend!
100,305,"Oct 25 2006 	Great Value	My buddy got a time share in this location. At first we were worried because it seemed so far from the strip. I must say for the price we paid about ($100) a night it was so worth it! (I know he paid extra for his time share program) It had 2 full bedrooms and bathrooms and a decent sized living room/ dining / kitchen! We just stayed there for 2 nights because we were going elsewhere and this was a meeting spot. I loved the morning bar by the HUGE pool. The hammocks are great! We during the early part of the day. They offer free floating boats and have a fun kiddie slides. The resort is pretty big and they offer free rides to the strip. Only till like 11ish? All in all, it was a great place to stay that was away from the strip at a great price"
101,305,"Oct 12 2006 	Having owned 3 timeshares...........	First of all let is be said that we have been great fans of timeshares having owned up to 5 weeks at resorts in Maine and Hilton Head Island. Initially we were very impressed with the site as we checked in. The hallways were actually cold which is always welcoming when coming in from the heat. We were staying with family in a one bedroom, pull out sofa in the livingroom set up. I give the resort kudos for being able to pull off privacy in that setting. Particularly liked the pull out shutters that made the livingroom private. The room didn't appear that bad initially, a little on the dark side, but bearable. For a room that was &quot;putting its best foot forward&quot; in an effort to make a sale, it was awful. The rug in the livingroom area from the bathroom (light switch behind the door when it opened beside the couch) was worn, discolored and frayed, as in 5-7 inch strands of rug fiber......the walls were filthy throughout parts of the livingroom and they needed painting. (Thought to self, &quot;What ARE they doing with the maintenance fees?&quot;) The air conditioning was non functional so we had windows open during the day and at night. Family member with allergies had a reaction to the dust and mold within the unit. Must say that a call for service of the air conditioning was answered promptly and was quickly resolved.We called the desk to ask about sheets for the pull out sofa and were pleased to learn that the bed was already clean and made up. Shifting to bedtime..................upon pulling out the sofa bed the sheets looked excessively wrinkled and then upon closer inspection saw several 15 inch long strands of hair and (stop reading if you are squeemish) found a big round circle of what appeared to be &quot;body fluid&quot; on the top sheet..........aaarrrrggghhh.......my husband tore the sheets from the mattress, complete with the mattress pad and threw them in the hallway, marched down to the desk and told them what happened and demanded new sheets and a clean mattress pad. The desk person never flinched or apologized but did have fresh sheets delivered within 20 minutes.......The parking set up where we were required parking on the side of the building (across from afore mentioned construction) and then a walk through a bit of an alley between the two buildings. There was no lighting at all and no visible security. The buildings have no electrical security. No key cards to get into the buildings which are wide open, no key necessary for the elevator...The resort has LOTS of potential and could do well with better management, improved cleanliness and some security. Again, it has potential, its a shame it isn't be realized...The location is great and very accessible to the strip.......that said, would I stay there again? Nope, just can't get past the sheet thing...."
102,305,"Oct 5 2006 	Customer service problems and construction	Just returned from a week at the Cancun. The rooms were nice enough, but to the north of the resort is construction that starts at 6am.The customer service received when staying there was way below expectations. Only after contacting the corporate ownership, my concerns were dealt with. I bought the weeks stay through a timeshare and given a terrible room. If you check in on a Sunday for a weeks stay all the good rooms (non construction) may be gone, so be advised.The pool was nice, the food on site was okay. We were woke up one morning by housekeeping trying to get in to clean our room a day early telling us we were supposed to be gone, then told we had to call the front desk to tell them we weren't leaving.Our room wasn't cleaned the day it was supposed to be cleaned, when I called the front desk, they told me I had to call housekeeping, they couldn't. My husband sat in a broken chair by the pool, when we told a staff member, he said there was nothing he could do about the broken chair.There are even more instances, but you get the point.Overall it is a nice enough resort, they just need to work on customer service training with their staff."
103,305,"Sep 20 2006 	Awsome	This was great! We invited our friends to stay and only booked 1 bedroom, we had plenty of room and privacy! Would recomend for familys and couples that want to get away from it all! You do need your own car due to the distance from the strip but worth it!Price was moderate and room service was worth it in the morrning! The pool was awsome we spenf the entire day just pool side drinkin' flyn' myans! Word of caution 3 will do ya !"
104,305,"Aug 31 2006 	Great for kids	This place was fabulous. My husband had to go to Vegas for a convention and My little girl and I came along. We found this place and my daughter and I didn't leave durring the day. The suites are great and it's so great to have a full kitchen when traveling with kids. My daughter loved going swimming but it was a bit cold so she would want to go inside to swim in the huge bathtub in our suite. Perfect, would definatly stay again."
105,305,"Jul 23 2006 	Love Love Loved It!	My fiance &amp; I stayed in the one bedroom villa with a pool view in the Cancun Building, and I must say it was like I was in paradise. When we first arrived at the resort we were a little dissapointed on how far the strip was from the resort and there's a lot of construction going on, but needless to say that didn't ruin the experience! A 5 minute drive away from the strip wasn't going to bother me. The staff were very friendly, and the check-in was a breeze.The one bedroom villa was exquisite. It was perfect for the two of us. The master bath jacuzzi tub was a hit, and the mini-kitchen helped save us money since we were t here for a week. The pool was so relaxing, the palm trees and ICE COLD pool helped us forget that it was about 95 degrees @ 10am! The new Caribe Cafe was a great place to get a quick bite, as well as their sundries store just incase you forgot something at home. Food 4 Less, Shopping Outlet, Washington Mutual, etc. was all located right across the street so that was a major convenience. THe noise level was as if you were at home, very comfortable and the AC in the room was great.Housekeepers come in midweekly and clean up the room, we came back to see that the dishes were in the dishwasher and the towels were replaced, the bed was made and everything was like we had just checked in!Overall, we loved this place. We were given a week at the Cancun Resort as a gift from a timeshare holder. They are in progress of expanding the resort, by the time they're done we'll be back again for sure, as a timeshare holder! Word of advice, get a POOL VIEW room, it really enhances the trip!"
106,305,"Jun 11 2006	Fabulous Las Vegas Fabulous Cancun	Fabulous resort. We stayed a week at Cancun Resort and we all hated to leave. The 2 bedroom unit was very large with nice comfortable beds and great bathrooms. Loved the underground parking in Cancun Building. The car was always cool when you got in to leave the property. Front Desk was excellent. Fast check-in. Nicholas was the best. He always told us a good route to take to where we were going. Pool was wonderful. Clean. Use your room key to check out floats or towels. Huge pool with hammocks and waterslides. Nice restaurant near pool with good drinks. Beautiful landscape. Grocery store right across the street. Nice library across street. We walked across the street to check our email free at library. Brand new casino called the Southcoast right down the street. Southcoast was fabulous casino with great mexican restaurant and bingo.Two trolley stops from the Cancun. Trolley $5.00 all day to all the strip or $2.00 one ride to Southcoast. Also, there is a free shuttle we didn't ride because we had rental car. Only negative to resort was having to make a U-turn to leave and the couch in the living room wasn't too comfortable (but fit the decorating theme). Mid-week maid service free with clean towels etc. We absolutely loved the resort. Non-Smoking resort and a nice break each night from the crowed strip. Hope to return soon to Cancun Resort."
107,305,"May 25 2006	Awesome resort	This RESORT is spectacular and is exactly what its name describes, a &quot;resort&quot;. I my opinion you could stay at this resort and be totally self sufficient, if that is what you desire. In a city like VEGAS, having a room(s) like what Cancun provides is priceless. The fact that you are able to cook in the full kitchens that the villas provide is a great idea, add to that a grocery store located right across the street from this property and you have a great combo to save some money. The Amenities at this resort are first class; pools, hot tubs, water slides, restaurant, game rooms, free shuttle to the strip, the list goes on and on. If possible I highly recommend the penthouse suite, one word decribes these rooms UNBELIEVABLE!!My wife and I will stay at this RESORT for many years to come!!"
108,305,"May 9 2006	nice resort/dirty pool	This is a very nice resort! We have used a number of other resorts and we really liked this one. The pool was nice with the fountains and many hottubs but the bottom of the pool was dirty and was not cleaned once the entire week that we were there. The units themselves are very nicely equipped with amentities such as a kitchen and seperate dining areas. They have a nice gameroom on-site with foosball, pool and ping pong tables. They also have a large screen TV in the gameroom to watch. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They have a shuttle on-site that goes back and forth to the strip numerous times a day. They have a laundry room with 1 washer and dryer. They didn't have a change machine for the washer/dryer even though they were coin operated machines. They need to have a washer/dryer in each unit because we have been to other resorts before that had them inside the individual units and you could start a load of laundry before you left for the day. It is always better to go home with all clean clothes than to have to spend a lot of time washing dirty clothes when you get back home. We may or may not use this resort again, mainly because we like to visit many resorts."
109,305,"Apr 19 2006 	Poor security; great resort	I loved the resort but had a latex pillow stolen out of my room by someone in housekeeping (I presume). I admit it...I have to have my very own pillow when I travel. It is pretty sad that the resort can't provide simple security for valuables in your room (not jewels, watches, cash, etc., There is a safe for those...but my pillow wouldn't have fit in the safe!). It was just pillow for heavens sake! Anyway, security wasn't helpful at all in finding the pillow or offering any compensation. I probably won't stay here again."
110,305,Apr 12 2006	We loved this place!!!	My husband and i stayed at the Cancun for 7 days. we really thought the facilities were very nice. the pool was beautiful. we did take advantage of the daily shuttles. we are pretty easy going travelers so even if the guys were late hey oh well we are on vaca right. the only thing i would say we had a problem with was perhaps they should have an airport shuttle. oh well overall we had a great time and stay at the Cancun.
111,305,Apr 11 2006 	A good surprise	This resort is a gem -- I had never stayed at a Grand Monarch property -- wasn't sure what to expect -- the room (a one bedroom) had everything one needed -- and was good for privacy if you had 4 people -- two baths and a moveable partition! The bed was a bit soft -- could be uncomfortable if you had a bad back -- but that was about the only negative...parking garage nice; pool area EXCELLENT with the most attentive lifeguards I've ever seen -- many water slides and they didn't even laugh if a 60 year old went down (me!) They had a steel band on Saturday -- free ice cream sundaes by the pool -- water aerobics -- and plenty of chairs in sun and shade -- what more could you ask -- easy access to the strip (better if you have a rental car) and every staff member from janitor to security was friendly!Would stay there again in a minute!!!
112,305,"Mar 13 2006	Loved this resort!!!	I just came back yesterday from spending 3 days and 2 nights at this lovely resort--This resort is located on the strip, but it was at least 1 mile away from all the &quot;mass confusion&quot; from the other hotels/casinos-They did have a shuttle bus available for you to go to those casinos, but I preferred to use my car to go there-The place was lovely and full of amenities, such as the room itself-I stayed in a one-bedroom villa, which consisted of (when you first walk in, a dining room, with table and chairs, a small kitchenette, with everything(except the food) you need to prepare and cook any meals--I was impressed with the refrigerator, stove, microwave, toaster, and blender, and all the utensils and pots and pans with accessories you will need--the bedroom had a full bath, with a hugh tub with a whirlpool jetstream, and two sinks witha hairdryer--the living room had a tv with a dvd/vcr player (the other tv was in the bedroom), and was enclosed in a woodpanel with with doors you can open and close-The sofa had a pull out bed to be used for another party--a separate small bathroom (with shower) and a balcony--The employess acted very professional and courteous--I did have one problem with trying to heat the room, because the weather was cold--I called the front desk and they called someone from housekeeping who came in minutes!!I enjoyed this place so much, I barely left it--This was truly a home away from home!!!I hope to go back again soon!!"
113,305,"Feb 27 2006	attention to detail!	we stayed at the resort in nov. with my wife, son &amp; daughter, and 2 of my son's teammates (pop warner tournament) we had a wonderful time, the boys used the huge pool &amp; jacuzzi, we cooked our Thanksgiving dinner just like at home, we had everything we needed. and what we didn't have, the room service came to our rescue immediately! I have been reading some of the other comments, and i totally disagree! We had never stayed in a timeshare before, and will never stay in a hotel again when going to vegas."
114,305,"Feb 26 2006	VERY IMPRESSED	I must say prior to our stay I was a bit concerned because I had read some of the reviews on this site. After staying there for a couple of days, I find the information/opinions posted to be false. My husband and I stayed in a one bedroom. A couple of days prior to our trip I called and requested a room with wireless internet access and a pool view. Both requests were met and it was very nice. I had read a previous review about the room not being very clean, so when I entered our room I did a complete inspection. I found everything to be clean and ordearly, I was very impressed. The view from our balcony at night was amazing. I enjoyed the fact that it was away from the chaos on the strip. There was a trolley that comes to the resort every 30 mins, it takes you to different locations on the strip and an all day pass was only $5.00. All in all our stay was great, the staff was excellent and very friendly. It goes to show you can't believe everything you read until you experience it yourself."
115,305,"Jan 31 2006 	Nice room - comfy bed	My stay was a bit unconventional - I went to Vegas for a tradeshow and didn't utilize the property much except for sleeping. The location is a bit south - probably 5-7 miles south of where the strip starts and about 14 miles from the Las Vegas Convention Center, but that could be a good thing as well! The entrance and lobby were nice - it seemed pretty new. I had a two-bedroom and I was impressed by the granite counters in the kitchen and both bathrooms (yes, a two bedroom with two bathrooms - both had large whirlpool tubs - the one in the master bedroom was huge! Nice tile floors - it was very much like an apartment with a dining table, living room and like I said, a kitchen with a fridge, microwave, oven and dishwasher (I think!). I wish I had stayed longer to enjoy and try out the day spa - maybe next time. I'll be back for sure!"
116,305,"Jan 2 2006	No where near a 5 star resort...	Resort was a disappointment--it definitely doesn't rate as a 5-star resort. At the most it probably gets a 3 1/2. Reception was unwilling to swap my room with a room with a view of the pool as oppossed to the roadway even though the resort didn't appear anywhere near capacity. The parking was atrocious, if you parked in the parking garage you would have to walk with your luggage through the lobby and out into the courtyard to access your room. Maid service was subpar...we had to &quot;steal&quot; towels from the maids cart because they only &quot;cleaned&quot; the room on Wednesdays. The jetted-tub spit out scum when tried to use it--on two occassions. The management expected us to inventory the utensils in the room. The second room was so small there was practically no room for the luggage and the bed comforters were probably the cheapest synthetics I've ever seen in any type of room at any level. The supposed concierge had very litle knowledge of her job, she practically threw the free show coupons at us and didn't even attempt to explain any activities in detail without prompting from me...she was apparently too busy talking to her buddy on the phone. Overall this resort was not even close to a fair exchange even though it is advertised as 5-star. The management and staff has a lot to learn. The pool area was nice and the availability of the hot tubs were very accomadating."
117,305,"Dec 30 2005	Casino or Not	I stayed in a 2Br unit Labor day week. It was hot and the pool was very enjoyable. Especially the free use of floats. We rented a car, which I would highly suggest. Parking on the strip was relatively easy...All casinos have parking and we took advantage of valet parking also. The resort is clean as were the units. I think personally I would prefer to be more on the strip where the action is, such as casinos. I found that I couldn't enjoy gambling as much knowing we had to walk to our car &amp; drive back...I would have liked to sat around gambling, had a few drinks &amp; took an elevator up to my room...It's just a preference. I've only been to Vegas a few times &amp; enjoy walking on the strip. I know many that like to sleep all day &amp; gamble all night &amp; this resort is much more for them. Driving in Vegas is easier than I thought. Our 2 BR unit faced the pool..not that we used the balcony much..mostly during morning coffee. Would I stay again? Never say never..if the price is right. It is nice to have a full kitchen, 2 baths. plus I did a timeshare exchange. All in all, it was worth the price."
118,305,"Nov 24 2005	Loved the Penthouse!	We stayed 2 nights in the Penthouse (2BR, 2BA w/kitchen, dining rm, LR w/Big screen TV and wetbar &amp; an outside balcony that had a spa/jacuzzi). The location of this place is on the strip, but way out there (a couple of miles from Mandalay Bay). You'll need a car! I don't rely on shuttles or cabs. I saw a bunch of people waiting as we arrived, but hey shuttles/cabbies have bad days too. The resort is still being built, but I've stayed in two different buildings and their upkeep has been good. Past the front desk as you go towards the pool, it seems busy. Tons of people walking around - well it's a timeshare resort and they're selling. So it's best to check in and go back out the front door to move your car to where your room will be. They'll give you a map.Check in/out was a breeze. Staff was very friendly. We arrived a few hours early and they had no problem letting us check in. Then, our party was running a little late and they had no problem extending an hour of our checkout. The Penthouse was on the 3rd floor (my MIL needed a handicapped room), there are other floors with Penthouses. All Penthouses face the pool. The MBR had a HUGE whirlpool tub in it. The 2nd room was for the in-laws and it had a walk/roll in shower and a seperate jacuzzi tub. Between the rooms was the living rooms, with a sofa and a wet bar. The layout was very well done. Beds weren't as comfortable as at home, but come on, we were here to gamble in Vegas. Maintenance was called due to lights that were out and they came within minutes. We requested a shower seat at the front desk and as we arrived in the room, housekeeping was fulfilling our request.I don't think I would get the Penthouse in October again, I would rather just get a 2BR (same layout as PH, but no outdoor balcony and smaller LR). The weather was real windy and cool, so we didn't use the outside spa/jacuzzi.Parking was good. They say it's 1 car per room, but we indicated that our other party was in another car, they didn't seem to mind. The pool was clean and I always saw kids and life guards around. I didn't use their poolside restaurant, but they do have one and a little general store. They also have a gameroom past the front desk before you get to their timeshare selling counter.I would stay here again. It's clean, they're friendly and polite. The location is out there, but we really didn't mind because we like to casino hop and we drove ourselves. The place was decorated in Mayan theme and it wasn't over done. This place could be loved by singles, couples and families."
119,305,"Nov 21 2005	A Few Concerns	I stayed here for a birthday trip with my boyfriend. We were here for 3 nights Sun, Mon, Tues. The first room we got to was right next to the construction so I asked to be moved and the front desk said as long as nothing was touched or used they could do it. The move was made. The room was okay.......I only noticed that the air conditioning duct over the table had some kind of dried redish stuff coming out of it--rust? I don't know but once I saw it I refused to eat meals at the table. Also, the jacuzzi tub had mold in the tiles. I went across the street and bought tile X and sponges to clean it before I would enter it. One night there was a thunderstorm and my boyfriend and I were riding in the elevator back to our room and the elevator stopped and the lights went out. We were in there for less then 5 minutes. Once I got out I called the front desk and was told in a dry/unconcerned manner that the main tower was struck and power was out. The rep showed no concern about what had just happened to me. From then on we walked the flights of stairs to our room. The next day we thought we might take the elevator again and saw a gray spider about the size of a 3 year olds hand and once again decided on the stairs. I guess they don't do anything for birthdays b/c all I got was a verbal wish and then lots of telemarketing phone calls. At one point we just unplugged the phone. I went on another occassion about 2 years ago and it was a lot better then what I experienced on this trip."
120,305,"Nov 11 2005	Nice Place	Stayed here for 4 nights,and was completely satisfied. When we checked in, the staff was friendly and helpfull. It was explained that we would not get a pool view room due to being a 2 bedroom unit. We were OK with this because it was our aniversery and we did not plan on staring out the window anyway. We had a nice room located in the main building facing Las Vegas Blvd. this was better then facing the pool anyway, it was relaxing. Large rooms for Vegas. The pool was inviting and plenty of lifegaurds. Resturant had some amazing food for the size of the kitchen. There was some cosmetic issues, but was explained that they are doing upgrades currently. We had brand new mattress.. very nice.."
121,305,"Oct 23 2005	Happy with the Cancun resort	We stayed here as part of our honeymoon in June 2005. We were more than happy wth our room, cleanliness and everyhing else. The pool was lovely, always sunbeds available and attentive staff. We had our own car but still used the shuttle service as we could then both have a drink in the evenings. We had no problem with the shuttle but the only advice I would give is that they don't wait so get there within good time. A good location just off the strip - a quick drive or short taxi ride if the shuttle dosn't suit. Would be more than happy to stay there again."
122,305,"Oct 19 2005	Great Place!	I stayed at the Cancun Resort the week of October 8-15 with my husband, mom and 3 year old son. We were in a 2 bedromm in the Merida building, third floor. The apartment was very nice, spacious and had everything you needed. The bathrooms were huge and the kitchen was a decent size. My mom and I had no problem working in the kitchen at the same time. There were TVs in each bedroom and jacuzzi tubs in both bathrooms. There is also a balcony which was nice to sit out on at night.We called housekeeping several times during our stay to pick up our trash and they were there in no time. Marilena and Lourdes were great! They also came in to tidy up and refresh our linens on the fourth day of our stay. Never had a problem when we called the front desk. Everything was handled promptly. I don't know what other people are talking about a smell in the rooms but I haver smelled anything.The best feature (in my opinion) was the pool. It was very warm (don't know why other people are saying it was cold). There was some pieces of foam in the pool but that was due to construction and it was no big deal! My son loved the pool and they have some cool hammocks for you to relax on. They also have 4 water slides which were nice and about 4 hot tubs located throughout the pool area. The great thing was that the pool was opened till 10 at night so that was convenient after a day on the strip and having the opportunity of relaxing in the pool when we got back was nice. The resort has several activities for different age groups throughout the day. There is a # on the phone you just call and a recording gives you the days activities according to each day. We never had a chance to do any of them since we were out all day on the strip. The location was great also. It was just a quick 5 minute ride to the beginning of the strip (Mandalay Bay). I liked the fact it was a non-smoking facility and also it was a very quite resort. We didn't use the shuttle bus service since we did rent our own car. They also have a game room for kids and an adult lounge in the main lobby area.Overall, it was a great place to stay. My husband and I would definetly stay here again on our next trip to Vegas."
123,305,"Oct 16 2005	Better than I thought....	I stayed at the Cancun Resort in August and had a great time. I was there with my mother and my 16 year old niece. The pool was great, there was a little foam in it due to the construction, but not enough to cause problems. The staff there was always willing to help out. I enjoyed the craft classes, there should be one daily for adults. The shuttle service was really good and the drivers were great, very talkative, it was never late no matter what time of day we used it. They should make daily stops to the supermarket across the street and also start earlier in the day than noon. I highly recommend the Cancun to anyone who likes to relax and enjoy time off the strip.."
124,305,"Sep 13 2005	Bad Experience	Booked this resort for three nights, Sept. 6,7,8, on line through Expedia.Was very hesitant about staying at the Cancun after reading reviews on Trip Advisor, but took a chance anyway-Big Mistake. This resort is no where close to a five star as advertised, more like a two star. The rooms were very worn and in need of an update. The room we were assigned had a very bad odor, smelled like sewer. I asked to look at another room in a different building, but with the same results. I told the girl at the front desk that the rooms were not acceptable to us and she had no comment, almost like she hears it all the time. We decided to stay on the strip - 2 nights at Mandalay Bay and 4 nights at MGM and had a great time. I read these reviews all the time but felt compelled to write one this time. Do yourself a favor on your trip to Vegas and book a hotel on the strip."
125,305,"Sep 7 2005	Not what expected but OK	We stayed at the Cancun resort for 7 nights, when we first arrived, we did not like the set up very much - the location is great - but the rooms do need more updating. The beds were horrible - my husb and I woke up with back pain each night, we felt like we were sleeping on box springs - and we had changed our original room and both beds were the same. the pool was nice and big, but due to the construction of the new building, the pool would get dirty and full of foam - i ended up taking the pool stick to clean out the dirt because they took too long, but it then felt like a waste of time because there was so much of it. the kitchen is small, but functional - and the place does grow on you. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath with 3 children - i agree that they should have 2 beds in the other bedroom rather than 1 bed - bathrooms were updated and bathtubs jacuzzi's were large and the place in comparison to other 2 bedroom timeshare's we've stayed in was on the small side. I wont say that i would not stay there again - but i would not rush to stay there either."
126,305,"Sep 5 2005	Nice Staff Nice Weather Nice Pool area Nice Location	Exchanged our Kissimmee/Orlando golf course timeshare.Staff was very nice, check in a pleasure, although I had assumed I had an exact room, but it seemed I had somewhat of a choice, &quot;there is a room facing the pool, but it is not finished being cleaned yet, otherwise ___ is available.&quot; Room was smaller than our enormous Kissimmee Wyndham Palms two-bedroom one; but remember, timeshares have different size and newer/older rooms, so that is why you and I may see variation sometimes in the description. Ours was a two bedroom, two bath place, adequate for our family of two adults and two teenage boys. TV is normal size (Kissimmee 52&quot;) I wish we were able to get a room in which the second bedroom had two twin beds (some exist here at Cancun) and not two queens, but they were all taken of course. My sixteen year old son is six feet tall, and it just wouldn't work with him and my fourteen year old son sleeping together on a full size bed, (our bedroom had a queen with bathroom attached, theirs had a full with bathroom unattached), so my fourteen year old slept on the pull out. (Our Kissimmee time share has, in the second bedroom, TWO queen sized beds, never mind two twins, and the master has a king; although the pool here at Cancun is much better than in Kissimmee) Also, they do a room clean at Cancun once during the week if you stay longer than like five days. (Kissimmee had NO cleaning day, unless you ordered/paid for it.) Anyway, the weather in Las Vegas in August was fantastic, like Aruba without the wind and occassional humidity, (my husband and I go to Aruba every year without the kids). We did not miss the DAILY thunderstorms that occurred in the afternoon in Florida at the end of June. The kitchen here at Cancun was small, but able to meet our breakfast and lunch needs. We spent the evenings on the strip. It was nice that both bathrooms were large (BOTH had two sinks, and BOTH had jacuzzi tubs). The pool area was lovely. Even without the waterfall working when we went, it was still very nice. Four waterslides; hammocks, poolside casual INDOOR bar/restaurant (I think they should have something TOTALLY outdoors, though, like a tiki-bar kind of thing) Much of the pool is five feet, so, if they didn't have the free floats and noodles, I would have reviewed it as &quot;too deep&quot;. There are shallow areas, but they are not large. Oh, the BEST part of the pool is the covered jazuzzi! As well as some small uncovered jacuzzis, they have this one larger Adult-Only one that is within the Mayan temple, yet attached to the pool. Real cool. The one thing I forgot is WATER SHOES. I didn't think I needed them, but if you are going when it is hot, YOU NEED THEM. Never mind hot, whatever they used to make the patio is SLIPPERY!I love the location. It is on the same road as the strip, (Las Vegas Blvd. S.)just a few miles south of the main stip, but so nice and quiet. (except for wishing we were on the third floor of our two story section. Had little kids above us and heard their running at most unusual hours)Food: There is a great ITALIAN restaurant, called something like the BOOTLEGGER, it is on the right as you head north to the strip.... highly recommended, one of the staff of Cancun suggested it, and it was right-on!I stayed at the Cancun seven nights, the Hilton 2 nights, and the south rim of the Grand Canyon one night, and I could've stayed longer. There was so much to see in Vegas and I loved the weather..... Have a great time,"
127,305,"Aug 31 2005	Dark and gloomy	Unfortunately this resort was not what we hoped. The rooms were very dark and the furniture uncomfortable. the kitchen area is small and inconvenient. Some redecoration is overdue. Loungers by the pool had to be taken very early or there were none available. The pool area is small for the number of the apartments and when the next blocks are built, will be even worse - in spite of a new pool on the plans. However, the staff are friendly enough and the shuttle service into the casinos is excellent. We wouldn't return."
128,305,"Aug 28 2005	Very disappointed	We were very disappointed with the Cancun resort, I think we would give it 2 stars. The beds were thin and you could feel the springs every time you turn over. The kitchen was so tiny that you had no room to move around.The decor and furniture was very shabby, the wood was actually peeling off. We had a one bedroom, with two bathrooms. The master bathroom was huge...bigger than the kitchen, but behind the door there was a big patch where someone must have made a hole in the wall with the doorknob and then they came in a plastered over it and never painted it.We had a balcony with a view of the pool and the construction across the way. The pool itself was very nice, but that was all we thought was nice.The staff was also nice, but the place itself we would never stay in again.Also we go to Las Vegas a lot and always stay on the strip in the Monte Carlo or one of the other hotels and find it to be more fun. You don't have to move your car all the time and we enjoy being right there. We visit family while there so we go a lot. We have a time share in Florida that beats the Cancun any day and so we were disappointed with our stay.Very very shabby. I also forgot to mention that both bathrooms clogged up a couple of times during our stay and we had to have maintenance come in. Also the bathroom lights went out, both bathrooms, had to have someone come up to fix the fuse. We would not recommend this place at all. Looks nice from the outside, but beware."
129,305,"Aug 23 2005	Great rooms service pool non-smoking facility :)	This is a great resort when you want out of the hustle and bustle of the strip but can visit it as often as you would like with it's on-the-hour, 8-minute ride. The pool is beautiful and great for kids with it's waterslides and daycare and kid camps. There is a grill with great food so you can take it to your room and eat, or grab a drink and sit by the pool. It's a non-smoking facility so you can escape the smoke from the strip and what a relief for a non-smoker. Our stay was great and we would definately stay again."
130,305,"Jul 6 2005	Not all that great	We just got back from Vegas, thankfully our trip was saved after moving to another resort after the 3rd day. The Cancun resort wasn't terrible (if you are used to 2-3 star resorts). It just wasn't what I was looking for. The suites were moderately decorated and the bed was very very hard. I'm only 35 and it hurt my hips to sleep on my side! The towels they give you in the rooms are very very cheap, so cheap in fact that I think they throw them away instead of washing them. All our towels were apparantly new and shed all over our bodies when drying off. Then just add some lotion and you have a sticky fuzzy surprise. Yuck. The large pool where mostly everyone swims was not heated, FREEZING! The pool was largely overcrowded and they had BIO Hazards where they had to evacuate the pool twice in one day. It happened for both pools as well so by 3pm that day all pools were shut down for the day. I will also be lucky if my kids don't come down with a serious bug in the next few days! -just like another review had said. I guess the one thing I will say for them is at least they did evacuate the pool... The kitchenette was very very small, but still workable. Limited underground parking, so don't expect to be able to park in the shade! Lots of scarey looking people staying there as well, we moved to the Aladdin Resort in town on the 4th day and really enjoyed it. I recommend the Aladdin highly!"
131,305,"Jun 28 2005	Excellent Stay	My wife, two children (10 &amp; 14) stayed at the Cancun Resort, June 20th thru the 24th. A great resort for a family! We booked a two bedroom condo, clean and well furbished. The resort pool was fantastic! Large, clean with four waterslides, plenty of chairs and tables. There is a poolside cafe/bar that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, a limited menu but what we had (burgers, tuna sandwich, nachos) were good. The resort staff was well above average, courteous and professional. They have a shuttle that runs from noon to midnight, takes you to the Vegas Outlet Mall and several stops along the strip. We used it several times and it was never more than ten minutes late from the appointed pick up times. The game room was a big hit for the kids, four pool tables, a foosball table and a ping pong table all in good condition. A very nice resort for a family. The only complaint that I could make is that they need to update the mattress/sheets in the bedrooms, they were a little hard and the sheet could have a higher thread count. The bottom line here is the next time we take the family to Vegas the only place that we will be staying will be at the Cancun Resort."
132,305,"Jun 21 2005	Cancun Resort is a great place to stay!!	We stayed at the Cancun Resort for 7 days (June 10-June 17) and I have to say that it was a great stay. The kitchen was small, but well stocked. The living room/dining room combination was comfortable. We (family of 3) stayed in a 2-bedroom unit on the 8th floor, corner unit of the newest building and I must say the bedrooms (both of them) were huge. Both had whirlpools with showers and a very large bathroom area. The master bedroom has a king size bed and the second bedroom had a queen, as well as the pull out sofa in the living room which we didn't need to use. Very quiet resort. The pool area was so nice. They have these hammocks under a shaded tent area that was completely awesome. There is a game room for kids as well as adults. Staff was on point and very courteous. The concierge was so helpful about places to visit on the strip and off. On our first day there, two of the televisions were not working and I called the front desk and the maintenance guy was there within 10 minutes to fix the problem. We rented a car, but they do have a shuttle bus. Plenty of parking (indoor and outdoor) and they are building two more buildings to complete this resort. The balcony is very long and we had a view of the mountains and in the evening this view is breath taking. The only slight downer was that there is a room tax of $4.88 a day in Clark county in Vegas for timeshare exchange stays. I guess that is a Vegas thing because we have never had this extra expense with our other exchanges, but I have to say it was well worth it. What I really liked most about this resort is that the entrance to your villa is from the inside (like a hotel room). On other timeshare resorts we have stayed at (Orlando, Palm Springs), the entrance to your villa was always from the outside. The elevators are quick. Overall, a wonderful stay and would definitely come back."
133,305,"Jun 16 2005	Cancun: Best Timeshare in Vegas	If you're looking for the noisy night-life of Las Vegas, then please book a room on the &quot;strip&quot;, the Cancun is not for you! But if you're looking for a relaxing getaway with a beautiful room &amp; pool, then by all means you'll love the Cancun!The Cancun is a sister property of our timeshare resort in Palm Springs, CA &amp; we spent 4 days here in May 2005. We are a single couple, but my husband's mother also stayed with us at the property.Check-in: Smooth &amp; easy - the staff was wonderful even giving us options of what one-bedroom units were available.Rooms (one-bedroom): Beautiful &amp; clean! Although the kitchenette is small, it was well-stocked. The one bedroom was of adequate size with a king size bed, closet, tv &amp; drawer space. The bed was fairly comfortable although we heard from our timeshare newsletter that they are replacing all the mattress with pillow-top mattresses. The bathroom was HUGE - double sinks, 2 person jacuzzi tub, plenty of drawer space, cabinets, towel bars, etc. The living room was used by my mother-in-law. The sofa pulled out to a bed (which she stated was comfortable) &amp; we were pleasantly surprised to find a door between the kitchen/dining room area and the living room area that had a small bathroom with a shower, toilet, pedastal sink &amp; medicine cabinet. The living room also had a closet in it as well as a wooden screen that can be pulled to separate the bathroom/living room area from the kitchen/dining room area to have privacy. Also, off the living room was a decent sized patio. Although we had a pool view room, the noise level was at a bare minimum. The only thing that would have made this room any better would be a balcony off the bedroom.Pool: The water was clean, the slides were fun for people of all ages &amp; the bar/food area is close to the pool. There was plenty of seating for everyone, but if you want some shade, get there before 10am.Transportation: We didn't use the transportation system because we had our own car, so I can't rate that. I can say that you are a few miles from the main strip, but I found it nice to have a &quot;retreat&quot; to go to at the end of the day.We loved our stay at the Cancun &amp; will always stay there when we travel to Las Vegas."
134,305,"May 9 2005	Great swimming pool	After reading several other reviews I was nervous about staying at the Cancun Resort. I even emailed the resort and told them about what others were saying about the resort on Tripadvisor. They emailed me back and reassured me that everything would be fine and gave me the managers name should I have any problems. They even called when I was there to make sure everything was ok. That's customer service!What I liked was the pool. It has 4 water slides and several hot tubs. The pool area never felt crowded. There is a very nice restaurant pool side. They supply towels, noodle floats, and regular pool floats. On Saturday they had a steel drum band playing live music...very nice!I read many bad comments about the customer service and the shuttle both of which we used many times. We called the front desk a couple of times and everytime they answered the call very promptly. And the shuttle which takes you to the strip was on time every time. The resort says it has washers and dryers but take note they are not in your unit. They are down the hall and there is a fee. What I didn't like was the kitchen. It was very small and the room was only made smaller by the dark wood shades they use in the living room area. But it did have everything you need. The bathrooms were large and the jetted tubs were awesome. They have maid service if you stay longer than 5 days."
135,305,"Mar 7 2005	Vegas Relaxing?! :-) It was Great!	Super friendly. Beautifully kept. Nice ambience, the pool was gorgeous, the room was great! I've never been able to relax in Vegas, it's usually non-stop shoulder to shoulder people and heat that you can't escape. I was blown away by the beautiful calm of this place. I enjoyed the jacuzzi tub (big enough for two) and it was so relaxing. The room was quiet, the accommodations were very comfortable and the maid doesn't knock every morning. In fact, the staff is there right when you need them, but they're not intrusive in any way. I highly recommend this resort for people who enjoy a little relaxation and repose after walking along the hot &amp; crowded Vegas strip. :-) Best trip to Vegas ever!"
136,305,"Jan 28 2005	No Where Close to 5 Star	Worst of our Interval International Stays. The staff were not helpful, seemed put-out when we had questions and seemed totally dis-interested in our satisfaction. Concierge was busy finishing her day and threw some brochures at us about shows and ended the conversation abruptly.The &quot;shuttle bus&quot; was &quot;in the shop&quot;. The back up van was jammed full, with approximately 10-12 of us remaining to fend for ourselves. No apologies, no &quot;thinking out of the box&quot;, just an &quot;Oh well&quot; shrug and an offer to call a $20 cab for us (no help with this expense).On the night we left, we asked for a cab. We waited over an hour and, instead of calling another company, the guy at the desk used comments like &quot;they're very busy and will get to you when they can&quot; FINALLY, he called another company and we were on our way, making our flight with 5 minutes to spare.I WOULD NOT recommend this &quot;resort&quot;"
137,305,"Jan 18 2005	WILL STAY HERE FROM NOW ON!!!	I recently stayed at the Cancun because no other place had rooms available and I loved it. We got the two bedroom which was very very big. The kitchen was fully equipped and furnished. Both bathrooms had jacuzzi tubs, the one in the masterbedroom was HUGE!!! In the living room was a queen sofa too. The dvd player played CDs so we had music going all day and night. The drive to the strip is not as bad as some say...maybe five minutes at the most. The is a market right across the street so you can stock up the fridge and save some money. The room is supposed to be for 6 people max, but we had 8...just don't tell. Our heater wasnt working when we checked in and I'd say within half hour the problem got fixed. It was toooo cold for the pool, but gosh I wish it wasnt't because it is also HUGE and very beautiful. I will be going again next month and will stay here again. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone."
138,305,"Nov 16 2004	Great place to make memories!	My visit to this resort is one I'll never forget. The suites were immaculate. Fully furnished with a fully supplied kitchenette and dining area. This is great if you enjoy cooking your own meals, which can enhance the experience. Jaccuzi tub was a hit. Even from the 2nd floor, my view of the Vegas area was beautiful, day and night. The water park is fun for all ages with slides, hot tubs, and large swimming areas. I had a minor problem with one channel on my TV and someone was there within minutes to change the remote and reprogram the TV. For my first trip to Vegas, this resort was made my trip worthwhile. This place is highly reccomended. I'll book it for my next Vegas trip!!"
139,305,"Sep 14 2004	definitely not a 5 star	We booked with Hotels (nightmare) we insisted we wanted a Jacuzzi room. and specifically asked that the jucuzzi be in the main room to overlook the strip. (in vegas). We asked if there was a casino at this hotel. and a restuarant. Truth is.... the restaurant is just a grille, what we thought was a restaurant was a large area where people were being worked over to purchase timeshares. and the Jacuzzi room turned out to be a jetted tub in the bathroom. the carpet was so filthy that within 20 min. my wife and her girlfriend's bare feet were black. there was no casino. We were offered to stay the next night free, we left and paid for the new york new york (which we will only stay at from now on... see the review) told them to give the free room to the homeless. we never saw the shuttle bus. and paid for limo as they said the shuttle not have room for our luggage anyway. P&gt;S&gt; Hotels inferred that this room was comparable to a $400 room... in fact I would not have paid more than $89 had I wanted to stay there."
140,305,"Aug 18 2004	Not a Five Star Resort	This resort is listed in Interval International as a five star facility. The resort has the appropriate amenities, it is beautiful, but the management, operation, and its customer service is very lacking. During our stay (July 30 - Aug 6) the following issues occurred:1) Main Pool was shut down July 31 - Aug 3 due to a major mechanical problem. A water leak in the pump room shorted out electrical devices. A good maintenance / security program could have prevented the catastrophic effect of a leak. Management provided NO arrangements for the guests to swim at other LV hotels. 2. The AC unit for an entire building shut off around midnight on Aug 2. We called the front desk @3 am and were told maint comes in at 8 am. We left our room at 11 am and the temperature was 84 degrees. The maintenance dept should have been called IN @ 3 am. Also no call was made by mgmt to inform us what was wrong - they waited until individual units called them first. Like the pool - the management and maintenance dept do not have adequate systems in place to run a decent resort. 3. Room cleaning - many timeshare resorts mention that everydayservice is not provided but this is the FIRST of my TEN experiences that it did not happen.... Actually we scheduled our midweek to occur when we had new guests arriving. Only the bed linens and sheets were changed. NO CLEANING. We had to call the front desk after we got back to our room and wait about an hour while a second cleaning was done. 4. The attitudes / behavior of the pool staff was lousy. The lifeguards were confrontational and arrogant. We witnessed an overweight woman in swim trunks/sleeveless tshirt confronted by 4 different people because it was not considered appropriate swimwear. The woman was uncomfortable wearing a real swimsuit due to her physical situation. Even mgmt got involved. We were confronted for jumping into the pool, sitting on the steps leading into the slide area, and wearing jewelry. We are 52 years old were not a Safety risk.In summary, be prepared for anything."
141,305,"Aug 4 2004	Family Fun	We stayed at the resort from July 18 - July 24 and LOVED every second of it. The Pool is one of the best I've seen, with 4 water slides and depths that ranged from 3 1/2 feet to 5 feet. The water was always clean and the lifeguards were always alert.The food and drinks at the pool bar were very good and service was above average.The room was very clean, we had a 1 bedroom with a pullout sofa in the living room. 2 bathrooms and full kitchen. Across the street from the resort is a fully stocked super market that is open 24 hrs. a day. Must be very careful crossing the BIG street to get there.The only down side to this resort is their shuttle bus. The week that I was at the resort, the average teperature was 108 degrees and not once was the Air Conditioning working in the buses.But besides that, Its a very nice place."
142,305,"Jul 30 2004	NOT a GAY friendly resort!	Apparently LESBIANS that wear &quot;boys&quot; surf trunks are not welcome on the slide or in the pool, according to &quot;JASON&quot; the pool manager . I am presently removing ANY and ALL investments my family has with this resort and its parent companies.. I have not felt so humiliated in all my life. I strongly advise AGAINST staying here, unless of course you promote HATE and INTOLLERANCE.Sincerely,1 Cute Lesbian"
143,305,"Jul 4 2004	Smell	First time visit at Cancun Resort (June 27, 2004) and last time. We checked in to the penthouse at 4:10 p.m. after a 30 minute search for a cart to take our luggage upstairs to the 4th floor. Upon entering the penthouse we were met with the nastiest smell ever. To make a long story short a cap to sewer pipe had broken and we had to put up with the smell from Sunday June 27 4 p.m. to Monday morning June 28 10 a.m. Imagine spending all night with the smell of sewage. I complaint to the front desk at 4 p.m on the 27th and they finally sent a SECURITY person at midnight. How's that for running a hotel. Finally it was repaired the next day. We had to sleep with the sliding doors open all night. No air conditioning.Next one section of the sliding door in the master bedroom fell off the track. They could not repair until we checked out. Talk about having privacy in the &quot;John.&quot; The other section of the door had no handle. Last but not least we found a huge cockroach in the bathtub in the smaller bedroom.I complained to the head administrator at the resort and she said &quot;we have no control over the smell.&quot; Give me a break. But yes they did charge me points. I wrote a letter to Monarch Grand Vacations about this experience and I haven't heard from them yet. But they sure want their montly payments each month on time. The Cancun Resort is a long way from being a 5 star resort."
144,305,Jun 27 2004	a great week!!!!!!!!!!	We just returned from a week in Vegas staying at the Cancun resort. We liked the accomodations a lot! A great place for families. The room was a one bedroom w/ 2 baths. Our 12 year old liked this resort a lot. Only a couple miles from the strip which gives you time to escape the hustle bustle of the night time. We felt like we had something to look forward to every night driving into the strip. Loved the pool area. Nice sandwhiches and good breakfasts at the pool restaurant. Staff friendly and helpful. Only have maid service once during the week but will refresh your towels and empty trash at your daily request. Had special music by the pool for father's dayWe would definitely stay again when visitng Vegas Very clean rooms and overall facility. Activities for kids also. When checking in request poolside view.
145,305,"Jun 25 2004	Had a great time - Could improve the shuttle	My husband and I stayed at the Cancun Resort from June 7 to 12. We had a great time in Vegas and really enjoyed our stay at the resort. It was really great that the resort provided a shuttle into the main part of the strip, but more than once we had to wait for long periods of time for it to show up and once it skipped the pick up completely from the Tropicana, leaving us there for a hour and a half in the hot sun. I can't compare this resort to others in Vegas as that was our first time there. However, our room was great, the pool was amazing, and we found the staff very friendly. We would stay at this resort again. It would be nice though if you didn't have to cross a 4 lane highway to get a few groceries."
146,305,"Jun 14 2004	TERRIBLE GUEST SERVICE!	i stayed at the cancun resort in las vegas on june 6th for three nights and i was very unpleased with guest service. they were extremely rude and not helpful whatsoever. they didn't know too much about the resort, i fell from the stairs as i was walking towards the pool area because the whole side of our building had NO lights for three hours and no one noticed it until i complained to front desk. then it took them another hour to fix it. we had crickets jumping into our forth floor penthouse every night and when i asked for someone to come up and take care of it, no one came! the water pressure in the shower was awful. they didn't even provide any toothpaste. i had a terrible experience with the rudest receptionist ever, as i was checking out and she didn't even bother to apologize for her mistake. she tried to say i was lying when i had a witness there the whole time. i am still very upset, this was my first time ever to use my timeshare. and never again will i go back and deal with bad service like that again!"
147,305,"May 21 2004	Wonderful resort!!!	My husband and I just got back from a weeks stay at this resort and it was a wonderful experience. We had two bedrooms with two huge bathrooms each with its own Jacuzzi and double sink, heaven!!! The kitchen was fully equipped and was spotless, as was the dining and living rooms. I especially loved the balcony which stretched from one bedroom to the other. The resort had a limited amount of indoor parking, and lots of outdoor parking. We had a rental car so we did not use the shuttle services provided. I would give this resort six stars."
148,305,"May 20 2004	Great time excellent resort for groups of 4 or more!!	Have stayed here 4 times. Great experience very time. Themed mayan resort. You must have a time share to stay here. Was excellent all around. Great free shuttle service that takes you to the strip and back-runs 6pm-12am. Great relaxing pool, with a water slide, juccuzis, and even hammocks. The rooms are like little apartments. The suites have 2 full size seperate bedrooms,each with its own bathroom with a spa tub, there is a living room with a couch that folds into a bed, and a small dining room with a table, and even a full kitchen! You can fit up to 8 people in the suite. Suites also have a mini bar, big screen TV, cd/dvd player, and even a juccuzi on the balcony! Beat that!"
149,305,"May 4 2004	Fabulous! Outstanding!	We were at the Cancun Resort from 4/28-5/2. Let me start by saying that if I could give the Cancun Resort six stars, then the six would be an understatment. We have been travelling to Las Vegas for seven years and this is the first time that we did not come home exhausted. We contribute this to the relaxing atmosphere of the resort. Acutally we found it to be an Oasis. The landscape is absolutely beautiful, the staff made you feel like kings and queens. The only thing that I found unacceptable is that they're not located on the East Coast of the US."
150,305,"Apr 23 2004	Peace and Quiet...Far cry different from life on the Strip!	 I was very wary about going to a hotel that I pretty much knew nothing about. We usually stay on the Strip to be close to everything, but we decided to make this a different type of Vegas trip. We arrived at approximately 8:30 on a monday night. We were greeted with smiles and our checkin was quick and easy. The outside of the hotel was beautiful, as was the lobby. Our room was pretty nice. We had a one bedroom villa facing the mountains. Fully stocked kitchen, sliding wood shutters and a balcony greeted us. The master bathroom was pretty large and the whirlpool bath was large enough for myself and my husband. The small second bathroom was a nice addition. We didn't have to run to the bathroom in the bedroom! =) The pool was huge! Both sides were open and several families were taking advantage of the pool floats and &quot;noodles&quot;. My 4 year old son loved the floats! The waterslides looked fun, however my son was to small to ride. One lifeguard I spoke to said they even offered &quot;catchers&quot;. They would wait at the bottom of the slide for your child to come down. I thought that was really cool. The jacuzzi's (approx 5 of them) were really nice and the hammocks rocked! We found the staff to be extremely friendly and quick to accomodate. The burgers were delicious! Especially the chili burgers, didn't have to carry cash around the resort, we just charged everything to the room and paid at checkout. There was no construction noise and housekeeping knocked politely at 10 am to see if we needed anything. There was no Strip noise (only a 10 minute drive to MGM) and ladies, the best thing of all was the Las Vegas Fashion Outlet store was a block away! Shopping! I would definately return here for a quiet Vegas retreat. They even offer activities for children! Arts and Crafts and other classes. Very nice."
151,305,"Apr 21 2004	Shuttle Bus Driver	It was the worse time of my life. I was a passengeron a shuttle bus on the 20th of april 2004 at 5:45PMThe driver of the Bus #369 License plate 454-PLC literally ran a suv into oncomming traffic. The bus driver did not have the right away and instead of slowing down and merging properly with traffic became verbally abusive, and I was scared for my life. a limo driver got out and comforted the driver in the other car she appeared shaken. I WILL NEVER STAY THERE AGAIN! For someone to have little regard for someone else's life appalled me. I complained to the front desk but only told me that their drivers are contracted from another company. This person needs to me accountable and fired."

164,305,Jun 10 2008	ce n'est pas un hotel
1,307,Wedding and Touring	Cool place right on the strip its a bit small but what do you want for such a cheap hotle in the middle of everything...staff are great also.
2,307,"Nov 11 2009	Best deal ever!	The hotel allowed us to check in by 1 pm, the rooms were neat and tighty, all drinks in the bar were only $1! And they had a Ben and Jerry's! I mean this hotel is the best, its right across street from Mirage, and next to Venetian! We were right in the center of everything and their service was the best. They are going thru some remodeling and their is no valet so you have to park in car garage in back of hotel but we didn't really care much about that. If your on budget, this is definitely a great place to be! I will definitely be going back there cause 70 bucks a night was the best. It didn't have the best of pools, but overall it was a great stay."
3,307,Nov 4 2009 	Excellent Value Cant beat Location	Casino Royale is now my place to stay in Vegas. I have been several times and did not even know they had rooms. All the rooms are remodeled. The dollar beers and margaritas help getting your day started. The gaming is not intimidating. Loved my stay there. A hidden gem. You can use the money you save to put on your favorite game.
4,307,"Oct 8 2009 	Great Location Good Value Exactly As Expected.	Before our first trip my husband and I really did our research before booking a hotel room. We're on a budget, and being we stayed two nights during the week we got a good deal on our room at $55 a night. We value location over having lots of &quot;extras&quot; because honestly, how long are you in your room in Vegas anyway?Pros: Excellent location! Centrally located on the strip, the Venetian and Harrah's are right next door and the Mirage is across the street. We could easily access everything located in the center of the strip. We drove to Vegas so we had our car with us, and the parking structure was no fuss, no muss and easily accessible. Rooms were just as pictured on the website, and actually a bit bigger than I expected. The bed was quite comfortable and we had excellent water pressure in the shower. There is an Outback Steakhouse, Denny's, Subway, and Noble Roman Pizza located here. We ate at the Denny's twice for the sake of price and convenience, and each meal was great! The casino bar offers $1 margarita's and $1 Michelob Light and Michelob Original Lager. Cons: Figuring out where the front desk for check-in was a bit confusing upon our arrival. You have to enter through the rear of the building due to construction, and walk through the casino to check in. We read a few reviews which people complained about this same problem, and it was still a bit confusing for us once we got inside. Because of construction there is noise coming from outside, and we had a view of it. The walls are also paper thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway, and at times we felt like our window was open because we could hear the construction so well. But really, coming to Vegas to get a great nights rest? C'mon...I forgot to pack my toothbrush, so we called down to the front desk to see if they had those cheap-o toothbrushes, but they didn't so that was kind of an inconvenience. The high-speed internet access is not in the room, it's downstairs in their lobby area. The margarita's served at the casino bar for $1 didn't have much tequila in them. It may seem very minor, but I thought our hallway smelled &quot;funky.&quot; Luckily the smell didn't carry over into our room!Overall, the hotel is a good value and you can't beat the location. That said, I personally would not pay $100 a night to stay here, because there are just too many &quot;little&quot; things that are not offered here that you might expect (like the front desk to carry some toothbrushes) from a hotel. The staff members we encountered were friendly, but don't expect to be treated like royalty here. Great budget hotel!"
5,307,"Aug 19 2009 	A Nice Surprise - Clean 	Great value for the money if you want to stay on the strip but have a lot more money in your pocket to gamble with. The rooms have been recently remodeled - very clean and with comfortable bed/linens and flat screen TV. While the room / rate exceeded my expectations, there were a few downsides to this hotel. First - if you will have a vehicle, be prepared to experience a small challenge getting into/out of the hotel's parking facility. It has direct access onto the strip (good), but without any type of pedestrian traffic control (bad). This means you will have to wait unitl one or two or fifty kind souls stop walking to let your car pass. On the other hand, if you don't have a vehicle - you can't beat the convenience or the price!Second - most of the rooms appear to face into the service areas for Casino Royale and Harrah's. Our &quot;view&quot; was of Harrah's employees smoke/break area and vendor delivery areas. Heard various delivery trucks in and out throughout the night. But - how often are you in your room in Vegas, anyways?Third - the windows have very nice plantation shutters - look really nice, but do not block out the sun like the traditional black-out window coverings you find in most Vegas hotels.Overall, a pleasant &quot;budget&quot; stay on the strip this time around, but will probably not return based simply on vehicle access - but if you are going the shuttle/cab/walking route, you can't beat the value and convenience of staying on the strip for under $75/night!"
6,307,"Jul 28 2009 	For it's location you can't beat the price!	With some bad reviews, major renos going on and a small gambling area that we thought would be really smokey, we really expected the worse, but were totally wrong! With less than 2 days in Vegas and lugging 2 small children, we opted to stay in smaller hotel over the gigantic ones. Looked everywhere and wanted to stay on the strip but the prices for 3-5 star hotels were in the 3 digit range so for $69 USD a night for the end of June weekend at the Casino Royale, this place was a steal!! Upon arriving at the parking lot in the back, the place looked less than appealing because of the renos but the front clerk said it would be done by August. From the parking lot to the front desk, it was a short walk, the two front clerks were really nice, no wait at 11pm. Got our room key and walked passed the gambling area which did not reek of cigarettes. I mean there were cigarette smells here and there but you wouldn't be inhaling anymore than walking behind someone who was smoking outside on the strip. There's a huge locked sliding glass door that separates the hotel rooms from the casino and everything else which was great and it's located across from the Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream store and one of the main entrances that leads you outside, another happy surprise! They gave us room 318 and it was nicely renovated, it looks as they advertised on their website. Beds were high and comfy, enough space for two small kids to run around and there was even a huge flat screen tv to compliment the room decor. This time maid service listened to us when we asked them not to come in our room to clean up....lol. Lots of hot water for shower, cold a/c works fine, small fridge was handy but no microwave for fast convenient heating drinks/food. There is a small coffee maker that we used to warm my kid's milk, which was fine. Night sleep was good, no noise from outside at all. Only negative thing I wish they had was a nice pool but for the weekend price and prime location, you really can't go wrong with this little gem. Great stay and I would come back again."
7,307,"Jul 20 2009 	Great Value Mid Strip Location	Spent five nights here in May, 2009, and will again later this month (July.) Front desk is right off the strip basically, as is the entrance to the hotel rooms. Very convenient. There is NO valet parking, but the lot is pretty close to the hotel. Not a long walk from most areas of the garage to the front desk. The &quot;good&quot; spaces outside the garage next to the casino are less than a minute's walk to the front desk. This place does not claim to be a resort (it's certainly not) but it is located NEAR some nice resorts. The rooms are basic, but clean as far as I could see. No bugs, blood, or guts that I could find, and this place is pretty old. Many, including the one I stayed in, have been recently remodeled though, and so really didn't look bad at all. I'd say the room I was in was better than a Motel 6 for instance. No floor to ceiling windows or anything fancy, but it was clean and functional. The noise from LVB was only slightly annoying, and earplugs took care of that. I slept real good. No loud parties in the hall, and they have security cameras too I believe. The &quot;hotel&quot; part of the casino actually runs east from the strip, and has four floors and 152 rooms; while the casino itself parallels the strip for the most part. The whole place is kind of like an &quot;L&quot; shape. Some of the rooms at the &quot;crux&quot; of the L are pretty much right off the strip actually, and it took me about 15 seconds to get from my room to Las Vegas Blvd from mine. I could also walk into Harrah's and be at their blackjack &quot;Party Pit&quot; in about 30 seconds...probably quicker than anyone STAYING at Harrah's. The gym next door at Harrah's is also only about a two or three minute walk from Casino Royale. I had NO problems with the front desk, and they seemed very accommodating to me, though I've read complaints from others. Maybe I was just lucky, or it was a weekday check in I don't know. At any rate, I'm going to be staying there AGAIN later this month. They COMPED me a room for three nights, and I didn't really think I'd get comped at my level of play. This is a BIG PLUS for me as a gambler. Other casinos I wouldn't have even earned a lousy (and it probably would have been lousy!) buffet! Granted the rooms here are always inexpensive, but I liked that they thought enough of my play to actually comp me a room. Heck, they only have 152 rooms! Maid service was good. I had no complaints. They also have free Internet on the first floor for guests. I felt pretty secure in the hotel; and the rooms have a safe as well as a fridge and I think maybe even a microwave (can't remember.) T.V. worked okay but not too many channels. I wouldn't say the reception (cable?) was all that great either. But it did the job for watching the local news at night, which is about all I used it for. There IS construction going on still I believe, so I'd ask for an even-numbered room if they have one. That would be on the Harrah's side of the building. I'd also try to get as close to LVB as possible or else you may hear them crashing bottles into the trash cans after the bars empty them from Harrah's next door. This is Harrah's noise, so don't blame the Royale for this at least. There is a Subway sandwich place on site, as well as a Denny's. Next door (30 seconds from my room) is a McDonald's; and below that is a food court with Chinese and Mexican &quot;mall food.&quot; Outback Restaurant (the busiest in the WORLD I was told) is upstairs and they will comp you if you gamble enough. It was good and I ate lunch there several times. You can watch the peeps walk by from there as well as the Denny's. I eat this stuff at home, and think most of the Vegas fancy restaurants are not worth the money unless you're trying to impress your girl. You can be in the Mirage Casino in less than three minutes from the front of Casino Royale. Heck, what can I say? I like this place! The plusses (location, price, convenience, room safe, fridge etc.) far outweigh the minuses in my opinion. The minuses would be the smoke in the casino (and I SMOKE!) The casino is pretty well-worn as well, and yes SOME of the dealers are downright indifferent or even rude at times. They probably don't get paid much. I DID have a great experience at their craps tables though. Best odds on the strip from what I can see, and I found ALL the craps guys and gals to be nice and not rude at all. There was one guy there actually who should have been working in a better place he was so good. He knew what I was going to do before I did, and kept track of my bets real well! Of course I was tipping the boys some too, which I'm sure got their attention, but they were nice to everyone from what I could see. Slots were not that loose in my opinion. I'd try El Cortez downtown Vegas for loose slots. It's a dump, too, but does have loose slots. That's it!"
8,307,"Jul 10 2009 	Fun change of pace	A little hold out dive in the midst of Mega casinos! We haven't stayed here, but make it a point in our yearly visit to Vegas to spend time here. It is almost refreshing to get away from the Glitz- where else an you buy $40 and up clothing for only $5 bucks?-(China?) Sign up for a players card and get a coupon book with buy 1 get 1 free bottle of beer or drink for a dollar? Or your $50 dollar promo play, You win the jackpot or you get nothing (Except the free drinks while you're playing-plentiful!) Yes its a dive but fun.Where in Vegas can you get a bottle of beer for a buck?The servers are friendly and frequent! The slots are looser than anywhere we've been in Vegas and we always break even or come out a couple bucks ahead. I don't think We'll ever stay there but its a fun change of pace to visit"
9,307,Jun 15 2009 	Rude Dealers No CW anywhere!	I did not stay here but was at the casino next door. I wandered into the Casino Royale and decided to play Let It Ride. It was approximately 1:00 in the afternoon on a Saturday. I was the only one at the table and the dealer acted like he'd rather watch the TV over the bar area than deal cards to me. He didn't talk and kept stopping the game to watch TV. I also looked everywhere for a cocktail waitress and never found one. Because of this experience I will never consider staying here.
10,307,May 10 2009 	Fabulous Budget Option - right on the strip!	Wow! what a find!This little hotel was great right in the middle of the strip.We were travelling at Xmas time and it was really expensive everywhere else but this hotel was fabulous. In a small casino next to McDonalds on the strip. The rooms were clean and spacious and had two queen beds.i would stay here again in a heartbeat as a cheaper option.
11,307,"Apr 22 2009	Casino Royale Is The Worst Place To Stay	We had such a bad time there. First when we got there we the room smelled like smoke. We ignored it and thought we wouldnt be in the hotel anyway, left a window open and enjoyed vegas. That was the first the second night we were there, our entire cieling where the front door in our room is, that entire area was leaking water all of our clothes and electronics was soaked. Turns out that the guy above us fell asleep in his tub and left the water running. To this day the management said that they are not responsible and told us tough luck. The management and staff are horrible and do not take care of their guests!"
12,307,"Mar 5 2009 	excellent hotel	stayed here in feb.09 4 days,clean room and comfortable bed,wide screen tv refrigerator.everything you need,small smokey casino but ok,cannot beat the location for the money,casino royale please dont change."
13,307,"Jan 28 2009 	Excellent surprise!	After reading the reviews, I was worried about staying here. But as soon as I entered the room, all my fears disappeared. Our room (229) was recently renovated---everything was new and very clean. Bed was super comfortable, flat screen TV was nice to watch, bathroom was spic and span, and sleeping was a breeze with no real noise.Perfect location right in the heart of the strip, with food and fun nearby. I'm not a casino afficionado, so can't say how this compares. But we enjoyed a few free cocktails at the slot machines and had some laughs!We overheard a manager talking about trying to get their stars increased, so stay here while you can before the rates go up!"
14,307,"Nov 16 2008 	Best Deal in Vegas!	I'm rating this based on the fact that it was a fantastic deal, very clean, and in a great location. Our room was very clean - and housekeeping did a great job cleaning it every morning. They are also recently remodeled and it's perfect for a weekend getaway for guys or gals. I wouldn't recommend it for a &quot;romantic getaway&quot; but it's great for a bunch of friends on the party! A bunch of my friends were in Vegas for a long weekend. They are a bunch of drunk idiots so they didn't need anything elegant - just a place to crash. This worked out great because Casino Royale is in such a great location. It's VERY easy to get in and out of the hotel (seconds from the main door to the street). They also have cheap food for late at night like Roman Noble's Pizza and Subway. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. My only advice is to ask for an ODD numbered room. We had room 328 and it faced Harrah's side alley. There were a bunch of casino workers smashing glass in the dumpster each night (beer bottles). The ODD numbered rooms face their parking lot, which would be much quieter. I didn't complain because the noise was coming from Harrah's and was beyond the control of the Royale."
15,307,"Nov 14 2008 	Viva The Casino Royale	Just back from a 12 night stay at The Casino Royale and can thoroughly recommend it. The location is ace, right in the middle of the strip, rooms were very comfortable and clean and the beds were adorable. Excellent maid service each day. No noise at night in the hotel section so we managed to sleep soundly. The swimming pool is an ample size and was still open when we were there. The staff were very friendly. IWe/d definately stay there again. June and Chris from scotland"
16,307,"Oct 21 2008	Most Underrated in Vegas!	Recently renovated, and centrally located on the strip, I love this place! Sure, this is not one of the &quot;major players&quot; in Vegas, but if you are looking for a clean place, with great location, this is the place to be.Not huge, it does not take one 20+ minutes to get from room to street. It took us less than 30 seconds! The rooms are clean and, as stated, recently renovated. One great feature: there are safes in the room that work excellently. I have to admit, maid service was slow. But when they did show, they did a great job.Cheap eats are all around this place. Located next to Harrah's, you can go there to eat at one of the many places there. Otherwise, it is directly next door to both McD's and Dennys. I don't gamble, but do drink and the .99 cent margaritas in the casino were awesome any time of day or night! There are stands and bars with drink specials not far from Casino Royale's doors, making it a great location for the person who does not wish to spend a fortune on alcohol, but wishes to purchase a lot of alcohol!Again, I don't gamble, but per other reviews and guide books know that Casino Royal offers some of the best odds on the strip. However, if you are looking to game late at night into the morning with Vegas' elite, don't head to Casino Royale. Past one A.M., the clientele is a tad seedy. But it is so close to the Venetian, Harrahs, among others. I read reviews that Casino Royale is of the smokiest. Well, they don't offer smoking rooms, or smoking in hall ways, so that is a plus. I must be used to run down little pubs at home, because I did not think even the casino was all that smokey. It is easy to catch the Deuce near Casino Royale. Either Harrahs or Imperial Palace has a monorail station, so that is near too, but I did not catch that at all. IP has a close by taxi hub, so that was handy.Overall, this is such a great place, that with the recent remodeling, I am sure that next time I go prices will not be as affordable...$313 for Thurs-Sun. Not bad at all!"
17,307,Sep 5 2008	Perfect Location!	This hotel is cheap and in the BEST location! It is located right next to Harrah and across the street from the Mirage among many of the other hotels that are walking distance....even in high heels! There is a 24 hour McDonalds within about 10 feet as well as some other affordable restaurants with great hours. The hallways of the actual hotel rooms are a little smelly and old looking but the room is decent. There is a nice sized mini-fridge right in the room and the beds are GREAT! I heard that they just refurbished the rooms and I was definitely happy with my booking. My next trip to Vegas will definitely be booked at the Casino Royale!!!PS - The casino itself offers $1.00 Michelob and Michelob Light as well as $1.00 margaritas....great way to pre-party without going far from your room!!!
18,307,Aug 5 2008 	You get what you pay for	This hotel is a good option if you are looking to save a few dollars. It is ideally located on the strip right in the middle of some great casinos. Personally I'd rather save my money for shows and some nice dining while in Vegas so this was a good choice in that regard. The rooms seemed clean enough though very basic. The bed was very comfortable and the room had a small fridge in it. The elevator was broken one of the three days we stayed there so we had to trudge up the stairs. The casino is small and dated but since I had great luck on the slots while I was there I cannot complain.The only complaint I had was that the staff there are neither friendly nor helpful. The front desk staff is downright surly. If you are a person who just need basic accommodation to rest your weary head and can fend for yourself then the Casino Royale is fine. Just don't expect &quot;Royale&quot; treatment.
19,307,"Jul 26 2008	Back in Time....	Being a frequent visitor to Las Vegas and having stayed at the &quot;best of the best.&quot; I have to say that staying at Casino Royale is a &quot;step back in time.&quot; A time when courtesy, affordability, pride, and cleanliness are an everyday commodity. I love the quick ease in which the hotel is accessed. No struggles for elevators and 20plus floors. The quaint facility has a demeanor of yesteryear, with the gaming of today.New mattresses and bedding and flooring were an even greater welcome than I expected this past trip. How many of the &quot;glitzy&quot; hotels actually give you a refrigerator you can use?? This one does.Perhaps it doesn't boast a celebrity, or offer buffets, but you will find this a very pleasant environment while you are in Las Vegas. If you do choose to play, then use your comps at Outback Steakhouse which is located upstairs, or the Subway, or Pizza bar.I give this hotel a thumbs up for sure."
20,307,"Jun 11 2008 	Great find	Cool place. Perfect location on the strip. Clean big rooms, no frills, but who cares your never in there in Vegas. No pool, but just use one of the other hotels!"
21,307,"May 4 2008 	Hotel OK Pit Bosses Negative	Hotel room in line with $69 pricing; friendly, efficient housekeeper; efficient, helpful front desk personnel; dealers at table games mostly good... HOWEVER, playing at a craps table one night, a pit boss was extremely loud and rude to a shooter. The shooter remained calm and mature and complied with the instructions by the pit boss on the throwing of the dice. But at the end of the fantastic roll, the pit boss continued loud admonishment of the shooter and banned the guest from shooting the dice again. Another pit boss then literally threw the shooters player card toward him onto the table. A &quot;big boss&quot; was in the pit and said nothing to the employees about their unprofessional actions. One young lady even told the pit boss this was her first time at craps and that when she threw the dice please dont yell at her like that. The inappropriate communication behavior by the pit boss drove some of us committed craps players away. We found $3 craps tables downtown with especially great people and service at Binion's - they were polite, customer caring, friendly - even when directing guests on rules of dice throwing. We played over 40 hours of craps at Binions with excellent service, fun atmosphere and even some winnings. One Casino Royale dealer told me that management kept up with table games' profits and losses throughout the day and night and pressured pit bosses when tables were losing to the house. Maybe that pit boss was trying to interrupt the shooter's great run at that moment - the shooter still made all of us a lot of money quickly. No more Casino Royale for us."
22,307,"May 4 2008 	Another great stay at Casino Royale.	What's not to like? We've stayed at Casino Royale two to three times a year for the past 3 years. We've tried the bigger hotel/casinos and found Casino Royale to be a better value and more convenient. Its a small, fun casino, great service, friendly staff, comfortable rooms. We liked the card access security feature. If your ego demands a fancy resort, you should book elsewhere. If you are looking for fun at a reasonable price, then stay at Casino Royale."
23,307,"Apr 2 2008 	Casino Royale is disgusting	This place is disgusting. From the moment you walk thru the door and get a combination of smells from the icecream parlor, The steakhouse, sandwich shop, pizza and the casino smoke all in one breath. It took everything I had not to puke. Still wanting to give it a chance we made our way into the check in room where a nice lady helped us check in but told us we would have to stand in another line for our club card. She advised us that she couldn't help us with. So we went to the line approx 2 ft over and waited a few minutes and then there she was just like in the Scooby Doo movies she was there to process our cards! OK so we finish there and head up to our room. The first elevator we see is out of service....we venture down the hall and make it up to the 2nd floor. It appears that this is not just vacation lodging but possibly this is where low income people reside......We open the door and a whole new aroma appears now the smell of nasty urine or just plain ol FUNK. We look out the window hoping for some sort of a view to make this work because the cost is nice and the location is Great. We pull open the curtains and our view is to the back alley parking lot area and it doesn't appear to be safe at all. The view just looked like something out of a movie where you know bad things go down back there. This place is definately very rough around the edges.The renovations did look nice, but you got the feeling like the bed is nice but who on earth has slept here before me? I am not a spoiled person I have had my share of stays in Motel 6's and such and I must say when a Hotel 6 is better than this place it's not that great of an option. If you are a couple I wouldn't recomend this place there is No chance for romance there. We called immediately and changed our hotel. We ended staying farther down the strip than we would've liked but I am thankful that we had that option!"
24,307,"Apr 1 2008 	Excellent for the money	The entire hotel is Non-Smoking effective March 1st, so this is excellent news for some, and heartbreaking for others. I got 2 comp nights, but rates are always cheap during the week, and about $100 cheaper on weekends than the &quot;big guys.&quot; The beds were more comfortable than the room I had at Harrah's the previous nights. AC worked well, and the windows opened, which is a huge plus for me, I enjoy fresh air. Shower pressure was decent, and bathroom was clean. In room has a coffee pot, refrigerator, and safe. Television has 14 channels, and no video check out. Also, my main complaint is NO internet access, even for a fee. You need to swipe your room key just to get into the building, I see this as a hassle, others might enjoy the extra security. To deal with the traffic, learn the back driveway into the garage. Just follow signs for Harrah's valet, but proceed straight under the large Harrah's globe sign that goes across that access road."
25,307,"Mar 29 2008 	An unusual package in a great location	We were headed to Las Vegas for a spring break weekend and picked a time when city-wide rates were off the charts. Stumbled on a deal for the Casino Royale property located in the shadow of the Venetian and across the street from the Mirage. A small hotel with no public space we had trouble finding where to check-in. Very nervous when we saw construction dumpsters in the parking lot. fortunately our room was already renovated. Comfortable room in a well-worn property. In-room mini-fridge, cable TV, nice bedding and a decent bathroom. There is a Ben &amp; Jerry's, Denny's and Outback Steakhouse in the property. Small casino without a lot of frills. The best part is the location. convenient parking and a very short walk to most of the major casinos. Literally a few hundred feet from the entrance to the Venetian. If you want to be on the infamous strip and you don't require a high level of amenities, then this property will work for you."
26,307,"Mar 17 2008 	Casino Royale is Great	Stayed with a group of 8 guys (age 25-45) to go to the Mountain West Tournament. All four rooms were recently renovated. New carpet, new beige paint, new bedding (VERY SOFT!). hotel is small but nicer than we thought it would be. It is a budget hotel but the location can not be beat. The casino bar hosts $1 and $1.50 beers with very friendly bartenders. The elevator is very small and old, we only used it when we had luggage. Overall a wonderful stay. Tip - walk to Harrahs through the parking garage to catch taxis.When I come to Vegas with my wife we will stay at the Bellagio or Wynn, but when we come out for a guys weekend definately Casino Royale."
27,307,Feb 26 2008 	Loved It!!!	This is a great place to stay on the strip. Lots of action and super fun. The hotel is clean and the service is great! We will be back. Perfect for the budget and also felt very safe. We have not been to Vegas in 16 years and will definately we go back to this hotel. YOU WONT BE SORRY! Good luck and VIVA LAS VEGAS!!!
28,307,"Feb 21 2008 	Good times at the Casino Royale	Small casino, Small hotel - perfect location. I have no complaints about this property at all. The negative reviews you'll read are most likely from people that would be dissatisfied with the level of service The Bellagio offers to it's penthouse suite guests. If you're young (or old), on a budget (or not), looking for a good time in Vegas without the frills - Casino Royale is the place to go. Checking in and out went smoothly - The front desk is easy to find (can't miss it in a casino this small) and the staff was very friendly. The room was simple, clean, and conveniently located in respect to the casino  Literally a 2 minute walk from the street to your room. The casino is small, smoky and charming in a retro sort of way. Table games are cheap, slots are plentiful - food is basic - I spent most of my time gambling and eating at the other casinos, but at the end of the night - always ended up back at the royale nursing a cup of whisky playing some slots. It's a good time. Check it out."
29,307,Jan 28 2008	great location great price	Our stay at Casino Royale was fine. The location and price can't be beat. We even had a fridge in our room. We would stay here again.
30,307,"Dec 31 2007 	You get what you pay for - LOCATION is awesome though	My husband and I compromised - we stayed here for 4 nights and then went to the Venetian for 4 nights. This place actually was exactly what I read and expected. Run of the mill cheap hotel in a SUPERB location. Yes it's used and kind of dirty, but the price cannot be beat. $59-$79 a night. It looks like any room that price nearly anywhere in the U.S. **Warning - YES - there were prostitutes about (by the security door to get in the hotel area) and they are not modest. NOT a family hotel. Staff was courteous, casino small but kept well, room was cleaned as well as could be. NOTE - each time I called for something they were there within minutes (extra pillows, towels, etc.). I even called about our T.V. not working and the guy fixed it within 20 minutes. Our window looked out over their pool - not heated, not clean in December, just an F.Y.I. We could also see the Venetian towering above AND heard that huge BONG BONG each morning, on the hour, from the Venetian's Bell Tower (see the pictures I've included here). So be warned. BUT - this hotel is what I read and I was prepared. Go there with these things in mind and you're good to go. Again, you cannot beat the price or location. Personally, I would probably not stay there again - I'd buck up the extra $40-$50 a night and stay a few doors down at the Flamingo or something."
31,307,"Dec 22 2007 	Great Stay!	It started out really bad, I had asked for an upper floor smoking. When I enter the bathroom the tub had this black gunk by the drain. I walked into the sleep area to use the phone and the bed was not made, it was stripped of sheets, everything. I called and went back to the main desk. I did not get a smoking room but the room the desk person gave me was very nice! He was sweet, told me I could move to a smoking room the next day but I told him I will stay in the one he gave me, the room was great. If you have to smoke there are areas on the same floor that have a bench and a big ash can. The cocktail waitresses are not as nice as they used to be. I think I saw their supervisor giving one of them hell , she was sweet to me; not a great thing to do right in front of patrons. I wouldn't be happy working there either if that's how she treats staff. The waitresses I have met in the past two years have been really nice - too bad they left Casino Royale. Great place to stay. I felt safe, it is clean and best of all, right in the middle of the strip. I always stay here and I visit Vegas at least twice a year."
32,307,"Nov 18 2007 	Great Location on the Strip!!	First of all let me advise if you want luxury and great strip views, breakfast in bed and expensive room service, don't stay here! If you want value, a convenient location on the strip and a clean, comfortable place to stay, book now! I have stayed at the Casino Royale 3 times in the past 2 years. It is not a luxury Vegas resort, but since I only use the room for sleeping and was hardly ever in it, the value and location on the strip are great. Check-in was quick, staff was nice and efficient, and access to the rooms is right around the corner, unlike the mega-hotels where you have to walk 3 miles through the Casino to get to your tower room after check-in. I drove my own car and figured out how to get to the hotel parking lot going the &quot;back way&quot; since it is almost impossible to turn into the hotel property from the strip. The pedestrians never stop to let you in, and if you try to nudge your car into the driveway, irate pedestrians start banging on the car! Gees!! Casino Royale is right in the middle of the strip with Harrahs on one side and the Venetian on the other. The Mirage is right across the street. Also, the monorail can be accessed very quickly by walking through Harrahs next door. Very convenient. The room is kept very clean, as was the bathroom. If you are worried about walking on old carpet, wear flip-flops or socks. I even had a phone message waiting from housekeeping one evening when I returned. I had left the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door, and they wanted me to know that they would clean my room if I just called them. Great housekeeping service. Also an in-room safe that I really liked. I will stay again in 2008. I can stay for 5 nights at the Casino Royale for what it would cost for 1 night at the Bellagio."
33,307,"Oct 30 2007	About what I expected	Worth the $ 80 per night that I paid (Fri-Mon).Good: great location, coldest AC in Vegas, 2 minutes from room to strip, great shower, never felt unsafe, friendly staff at check-inBad: paper thin walls, view of a wall, no room service (but takeout from Outback in the hotel), thought room was clean but noticed black marks in the tub that came from my feet after walking thru the room on the carpet, and finally - you're staying at the Casino Royale"
34,307,"Oct 10 2007 	Convenient location!	If you want to get away from all the mega resorts, this is a great place to stay and very affordable. The casino is small compared to the mega resorts but that is what I liked about it. Easy to get around, not overly crowded, and convenient location. Check it out!"
35,307,"Oct 2 2007	Don't Book this One	This hotel was awful. The carpet was filthy, the sitting chairs were filthy. THe bathroom was the only clean area in the room. It was hard to even locate how to get in and up to the check-in desk after being dropped off by the shuttle car. The hotel stay was given to me...but I would never book this hotel. It is equal to a Motel 6 or less. Don't book this one."
36,307,"Aug 27 2007 	Clean value hotel	We stayed at the Casino Royale as part of the Tahiti Village &quot;free trip&quot; promotion, and added a day on our own at the end. The room was immaculate. For the most part this room on the 4th floor was quiet. Air conditioning during 4 days of 100+ temps was very adequate. I would recommend the hotel for anyone wanting an economical place to stay (our extra night was $69). It is right next to Harrah's...and Harrah's buffet is awesome!(No views in this hotel, all the rooms face other walls or parking lots.)"
37,307,"Jul 30 2007	Don't Stay Here! Horrible!!	Ok, so the only thing good about this hotel was the convience to bigger and nicer hotels!!All and All this hotel sucked!! It was hot, smelled old, you couldn't really get away from the smoke from the downstairs casino. We were on the 2nd floor. Saw a Roach that fell down in the light fixture! Gross! The comforter was old, thin, torn and had cigarette holes in it. The bed was soggy and had plastic on it. Worst sleep ever and I was dead tired. TV was a 19 inch analog cable televsion that didn't get a good picture. It cut in and out by moving the cable wire! I guess the bathroom was OK... Clean, but our tub was stopped up where water was coming up to your ankles! EEK! We did call and a guy came and fixed it within 5 minutes. So that was good, I guess. It looks decent from the outside, but it is like an old MOTEL 6 that hasn't been updated since 1960!!! in the back side of it. There is no valet parking like the other hotels. Horrible! I haven't seen an elevator that old ever! You get lost trying to find out where you check in to the hotel. There are no signs and no is around to help you find it. The phone was so old~ and It was way across the room where usually they are on the nightstand! It had this small kitchen area, that had a fridge i think and a safe. No Iron, had to request it.So i guess all and all, if you want a crappy hotel just to sleep in during a vegas trip, pick this one. But if you really want to experience all the cool things that the other hotels would offer, go somewhere else. You know like a fitness room, spa, pool , wireless interent, shops and resturants. They had no room service or any resturants inside the hotel.So my recommendations to stay in Vegas if you want a nice time are the Luxor, Wynn, Mandalay Bay, Ceaser's Palace, MGM Grand, Venetian, PLanet Hollywood, Just any of the main big ones.Bally's and Flamingo didn't look so hot either. I am not sure about Harrah's. That's my review, my very first one b/c I just HAD to tell others!!-Anomynous"
38,307,"Jul 16 2007 	The Good The Bad The Ugly	The Good: Location, location, location! About as close to all the action on the middle of the strip as you could get. The room rates for this spot on South Las Vegas Blvd. can't be beat. The Bad: This all depends on what you are looking for. If all you want is a clean room to lay your head and a place to get cleaned up the Casino Royale will fit the bill. This Hotel/Casino is a former Motel 6 with minimal amenities and even less style. The Ugly: Compared to its surroundings, this place is pretty dreary. The Casino draws a younger (21-30) crowd clamoring for $1.00 beers and Margaritas and they can get a little intolerable after dropping a ten spot on drinks. The Synopsis: By modern Vegas standards, the Casino Royale is unrefined and the tiny casino is reminiscent of the old grinder casinos of days gone by. Dont come here expecting anything other than a basic motel (with the exception of an in room safe) and you wont be disappointed."
39,307,"Jun 6 2007 	Liked this great location	Stayed May 7th for 4 nights and was pleasantly surprised. Already scheduled my June trip for the Casino Royale. Keep in mind that I am a poker player and don't spend more than 6 hours per night in my room. However, the location is great. Just a few minute walk to Bellagio, Mirage, or Treasure Island and I find all the poker action I need. Then after a long day at the poker tables, the 1 dollar Michelob beers at the Casino Royale are very welcome. I also enjoyed the $3 craps tables. You can play a long time on not very much cash when you want to play a house-edge game there.Granted, the place could use new carpeting in the hallways of the hotel and is a bit dated, but the rooms are clean and decent and quiet. Maid service is very good and the staff was friendly. If you are looking for luxury, go to Caesars, but if you want a great location at a great price, this isn't bad. I used Travelworm to book the good room rates, but I'm sure most of the online booking places have the same good rates for this place."
40,307,"May 31 2007 	Cheap 	We stayed for 2 nights at the end of March 2007- a Fri &amp; Sat-- The reason picked Casino Royale was mainly price and location. We were looking at booking about 1-2 months before we arrived and at the same time - prices for strip hotels were at least DOUBLE or more since weekends are most expensive- we paid $85 US/night and booked through TravelWorm. We were sceptical about booking through a lesser known website like Travelworm- but we did a lot of research and found out that they are based out of LasVegas- Plus the person we talked to was knowledgable and friendly- There were no problems with the booking. Booking though the website was cheaper than booking directly - even IF you had AAA.Location can't be beat considering the price. A downside is that taxis can not or do not want to stop here to pick people up. We waited 1.5hr on Sunday for a taxi to come (after calling and recalling 3 times) The only reason we got a taxi was that one was dropping off people and we happened to flag it down in time. A word of advice- either don't bother calling for a taxi (have your own car!) or walk to the next big hotel (not a short walk either!) to catch a taxi. Close to the Venetian &amp; Harrahs, across from the Mirage- Denny's, Outback, and some other fast-food type places close by. About the accomodations:Check-in: -located within the casino... slighty hard to find... quick though- under 15 minutes for everything.Room: we stayed on the fourth floor, the very furthest room down the hallway- it was a long hike- but we're into exercise and didn't really mind--unfortunately this particular room did NOT have a fridge like it should've...Safe was available.. Room cleanliness was decent- didn't notice any weird smells... only the middle elevator was working... Since we were at the end of the hall- we had no problems with noise.Beds:-ok, we aren't very particular and can fall asleep on anythingBathroom:- brightly lit, decently clean, good water pressure-- nothing fancy here- but was adequatePool- we didn't use- looked small- but I suppose if you were the only ones using it it would be ok-Other:-Ice maker was decent- didn't have to wait too long for a large amount of ice. (we didn't have a fridge and therefore had to resort to the ice-in-the-sink method of keeping out drinks cold)In summary- this would be the hotel for people that are not that picky about where they stay. If you're looking for fancy room service, spa service, big pool etcetc- don't bother here. If you just want a room to sleep in while you are touring the strip- the price and location will more than justify your stay."
41,307,"May 7 2007 	Cheap...can't beat the location!	Would I stay here with my wife and kids? No way! However, I did go with a bunch of guys for a bachelor party and it was perfect. Imagine if a Motel 6 had a casino and that is what Casino Royale is like.Positives:Location. Casino Royale is located between The Venitian and Harrahs at Mid strip.The staff was VERY nice and helpful.Beer is only a 1.50 (unless it's Michelob then it's only a buck)In-room safeNegatives:Hallways smell mustyDoor and lock are flimsyBed is uncomfortableHallways are noisyI would recomend this place for college kids or bachelor/Bachlorette parties on a budget"
42,307,"May 1 2007 	A good value	We stayed 3 nights at casino Royale, we checked in early with no problems. Our room was pretty average, 2nd floor with a view of the Harrah's loading dock, in room safe and fridge. The location can NOT be beat, wedged between Harrah's and the Venetian and we could watch the Mirage volcano from the penny slots. The casino was small and laid back, we were first timers and we didn't feel out of place. Food selection was limited, but Denny's for breakfast and late night pizza was fine for us. The pool is a little bigger than your average hot tub, but still refreshing and no little one's running around. One dollar michelob's and margarita's all the time, cocktail service was a little slow, but friendly. You are on your own staying here, so if you need a spa treatment or room service or a cabana you need to go somewhere else, but if you want a cheap place close to the action this is it."
43,307,"Apr 17 2007	Great Place To Stay with unbeatable prices !	Just got back from my stay at the Casino Royale Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, and it was a great place to stay, in a great location in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip ! Its a smaller, private hotel, non of the bells and whistles of the bigger hotels around it, but for the price, its unbeatable! The staff was helpful and did everything they could to help, including letting us check in early as well as check out late, due to our flight times. I'll definitely be staying here again when I visit Las Vegas, and would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great place to stay in the heart of The Strip! The combination of the price and location of the Casino Royale is unmatched! Also, the hotel is right next door to Panda Express, McDonald's and Chipotle, which is a great alternative to the overpriced Subway in the casino!"
44,307,"Apr 16 2007 	Great Value!	Casino Royale offers exceptional service, courteous staff, clean hotel rooms, great views and a perfect location in the heart of the strip. We stayed at Casino Royale for a week last week and really liked it. Although I was sceptical at first, I cannot complain. Check in was so quick unlike the mega hotels in Las Vegas. We asked for a room higher up (as recommended through reviews) and were given a room on the 4th floor. Access to the strip was so quick and easy in comparison to hotels on the strip where you have to literally walk a mile to get to the street. Amenities included a mini fridge, a safety deposit box (which could be accessed via digits of your choice or by credit card), a coffee maker, and a hairdryer. One item that we needed that was not initially in the room was an iron and ironing board, but when we requested one it was brought to our room within 5 minutes. You definitely wont get service that quick at any of the monster strip hotels. The stay was quiet except for situations out of the control of the hotel such as the clock tower at the Venetian, the Mirage volcano until midnight and the crazy drunken hallway antics. Security was great at trying to keep out those not staying at the hotel. The only small problem we noticed was that one of the elevators was out of service the whole week, but there was an alternative elevator available and the stairs were just fine. We would definitely stay at Casino Royale again! For those with negative commentsI dont know about you but when I go on vacation, I spend more time partying, checking out the sites and scenery because thats what I like to do on my vacation. A hotel for us is the place to crash, go to sleep ;) and shower. I'd rather spend the $$ I saved from staying at a cheaper hotel on dinners, shows and nights out on the town. Maybe expensive hotels are more suited for your needs, if all you want to do is stay in your hotel room for the entire vacation."
45,307,"Apr 9 2007 	Bosnian Goat Ranch	This was my first time in Vegas, but THANK GOD Casino Royale wasn't my first experience in accommodations. Fortunately, we were able to have spent the first night of a 4 day stay in the Hard Rock Cafe, which I would fully recommend to anyone.But let's get about the Casino Royale. To put the positive before the negative, I will have to say that the location is ideal (which is probably the reason this place stays in business). It's centrally located on the strip, and fairly accessible to just about anywhere you'd like to go. In addition to this, the casino itself is fairly compact, but fun (if you're in to low-rent, down to earth, friendly dealer..etc). Blackjack switch is a fun game, that improves your odds slightly, but costs considerably higher to play (because you're forced to play two hands instead of one)Now the negative. I'll list them numerically so as to be sure I capture them all.1) The Smell: The entire place smells of urine and smoke. And the ventilation is HORRIBLE. The AC did not work (I read about this in a different review as well, so evidently it's commonplace at this hotel)2) The Accomodations: The beds were uncomfortable, the rooms were dank and musty, the bathroom fixtures (namely the shower head) were coming out of the wall, and the rooms were dirty as ever...in fact, we found several long, black hairs in the shower that were evidently overlooked in the last &quot;cleaning&quot;3) The Noise: Some construction was occurring in the parking lot behind us, and as much as I like the sound of clanging wood and metal in the morning, I did grow rather tired of the [--] rock radio station that was playing.4) The Accessibility: I know - a contradiction to my previous statement about the location...but I'm talking ACCESSIBILITY. This place is so difficult to turn in to, that a few cab drivers even refused to pick us up when they discovered our destination. I'm not kidding, it takes a $4-5 cab fare just to make the right turn from a block away. Once you get in the door, it's even more difficult to get to your room...the hallways are extremely long, and when we were there, one of the elevators was out of service. In short, we had to pass through a clear glass door (that wouldn't open half the time, no matter how many times you swiped your card), up one flight of stairs, down a long smelly hallway, into the elevator, up two floors, back down the smelly hallway and into your room. UGH5) We found so many things wrong with this place, and were so outright DISGUSTED by the hotel in general, that we humorously named the place &quot;The Bosnian Goat Ranch&quot; after staying there for one night, and commonly referred to it as such for the remainder of our stay.Two stars - one for location, one for the entertaining low-rent casino. Everything else is worth the extra $50 to go elsewhere."
46,307,"Apr 9 2007 	No Complaints	This is a decent hotel. It is clean and convenient. Wonderful location and spacious rooms. The staff was friendly and we loved the little casino. Having Outback, Dennys, Subway, and the little pizza joint just a hop skip and a jump away was GREAT! You can go in and out of the huge hotels whenever you want (use thier pool, poolside bar, etc). We would have no objection to staying at the Casino Royaleagain."
47,307,Mar 5 2007	You get what u pay for!	It was my 21st b-day and there was nowhere to stay that was decent looking. We decided to stay at casino royale for its location. We get the room its ok looking everything basic u need. Then I i went straight to the bed and it was very uncomfortable and noisy. Then at night you can hear workers from Harrah's making alot of noise throughout the night with very loud music. Also the ac did not work but it did make alot of noise. To top it off the rooms keys did not work. And if they dont work u cannot even get inside the building where the rooms are. I stayed for 30 mins until someone had a key to let me in. Overall I would not stay here again. You can pay 50 dls more for a better stay.
48,307,"Jan 24 2007	Great Place To Stay!	We stayed 5 nights at Casino Royale and we will be staying there again, in December. The location couldn't be more perfect and there's NO way you can beat the price. Granted, if you're looking for &quot;flashy&quot; or opulance, then you may be disappointed, but really...if you go to Vegas, WHY would you want to spend so much time in your room that it would make a difference?? We spent most of our time enjoying the sights of Las Vegas, not sitting in our room.The rooms were spotless. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We were very comfortable, never having to be concerned about security as we felt safe at all times. We don't really gamble, so I can't say the casino itself was good or bad, but people seemed to enjoy themselves there. We went to several shows and all of them were a comfortable walking distance from the hotel....everything was, actually. And the things we went to that were off the strip, we needed only to walk across the street and the busses were there every few minutes. Honestly, you can't go wrong at Casino Royale!All in all...we highly recommend Casino Royale and will be very happy to go back again in Decemner."
49,307,"Jan 15 2007 	Okay 	My husband and I stayed at the Casino Royale over the Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. We are in our 40's.We booked a room there because it was the only place that was on the strip that had a reasonable rate for that particular weekend.The Hotel:nothing fancy, a bit rundown, perfect for folks who don't care too much about imageThe Hallways:a little creepyThe Room:average, refridgerator and safe a big plus, carpet looks old, pillows were extremely comfortable, furniture old, only channels one thru fourteen, not as clean as it could be, doors to rooms not secure enough - they look like people have tried to break into them before, was not overly comfortable being alone in the room at night while my husband was at the casino - no view to speak ofThe Casino:extremely smoky, young crowd(my husband enjoyed the casino) The Employees:everyone I came in contact with could not have been nicer, from Reggie who checked us in, to the security guard, to the folks selling the clothes in the front lobby, the dealers and waitresses, the folks at Denny's right next doorOverall:price was terrific for a holiday weekend on the strip in a good location (across from Mirage - next to Venetian)AAA discount availablevery few amenitiesperfect place for a bachelor partyI would likely not stay here again because it is not the right place for me but I'm sure some folks would think it was just fine"
50,307,"Jan 8 2007 	Better then Harrahs and Others	The hotel is perfect if you going to drink, gamble, and have a good time. The pool is as big as my car, but you can go to other hotels pools. The rooms are nice and clean, and larger than most. There is no view, but you make up for that in location. The rooms are 30 seconds from the casino floor through a secured glass doorway. There is never a wait for the elevator and the staff is excellent. One important thing to note. We had friends staying at the Mirage and Harrahs. It took us 1 min and 10 seconds to get to Harrahs casino floor from our room. It took my friends who were staying at Harrahs 4 min and 19 seconds to get to the floor when we timed it. Once I know if was longer. It took us 3 min and 29 seconds to get from our room to the mirage, and we wait to cross the street. It took our friends 4 min and 35 seconds to get from their room in the Mirage to the casino floor. Before the Love show, they waited 5 minutes for an elevator and then had to walk a mile to the casino. By staying here, you save hundreds but are closer to the action then at the other hotels. The only difference is the pool, but you can easily go to other casinos pools. We went to the Flamingos twice. We carried a back pack and everything. The casino is great. You get a two free ice creams at Ben and Jerrys for signing up for their club and their drinks are strong. The waitresses are quick to bring them too. $1 michalobs are perfect for getting the night started."
51,307,"Nov 27 2006 	Give Casino Royale a Chance	Just got back from a trip last weekend that included a stay at the Casino Royale. While the hotel/casino is definately not the shining star on the strip, it does have several pluses that make it worth a look.Probably the best thing to say about the Casino Royale is its location. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of the strip, and is directly across from Caesar's Palace. Free parking in back with a 5 story garage makes the hotel really accessible. The price is another plus. Where else can you get a hotel room on the strip for under $100? The rooms are comparable to any standard hotel (i.e. La Quinta, Best Western, Holiday Inn) and are clean and roomy. Access to the hotel is by room key only, adding to an overall secure feel. While the rooms might not be swanky, lets be honest with ourselves. How much time do you actually plan on spending in your room while in Vegas?The hotel has an Outback and a Denny's, which is perfect in the morning to ease last night's hangover. The cons all come from your expectations. If you want a bunch of fluff, Casino Royale is definately not for you. The dealers in the casino are not the friendliest, and the hotel doesn't offer the amenities of others on the strip. If you are looking for a safe, clean, and reasonalby priced hotel in the middle of the strip, try Casino Royale. We will be visiting again in the spring."
52,307,"Oct 24 2006 	Not Good!!!	The Casino Royale was a TERRIBLE experience for us, I'm glad it was not the first time we have visited Vegas because we would NEVER go back!The Hotel was dirty and smelled the room was a good size but DIRTY.The Casino was very DIRTY also and the people that work there are VERY rude.There was alot of other thing's that happend ....too many to type.All I can say is spend a little more $$ and stay elsewhere...The next time we go we will go back to the Sahara!"
53,307,"Oct 6 2006	Got Robbed!!!	Our stay was ok there up until the last day. The rooms are basic and it seems that they have renovated recently. The casino itself is a bit shabby and they only have these sucker blackjack games, called blackjack switch, aside from maybe one or two regular blackjack single deck games, which are always full.The last day after checking out I put my suitcase and backpack in the car. The trunk had my friend's large suitcase so there was no room. In less than thirty minutes, in broad daylight, our car was broken into and they stole everything I had. They hit another car too that was nearby. Both the cars were in the parking garage on the level visible from the main lot. There are no security cameras in this hotel's parking garage and there is not even a security guard patrolling the area. This place was obviously targeted for that reason and they knew to rob the guests who were checking out and putting luggage in their cars. The security dept at the casino has not returned one of my four calls asking about the case and inquiring about whether they reviewed the security cameras that are on the outside of the casino itself, that can view the main outside lot and the traffic coming and going at the casino. Nothing, no response at all. This place is not that safe in my opinion and I would never go back. I would stay at a nicer hotel with more security in place, since it seems that Las Vegas has some pretty shady and dangerous criminals preying on the tourists visiting the Strip."
54,307,"Oct 3 2006 	Great Location but.......................	We spent a 3 day weekend at this hotel, and considering its location right on the Las Vegas Strip, surrounded by multi mega-million dollar resorts its hard to be fair and not give it a negative review. The hotel was super clean, and you couldn't ask for a better location. The negatives were the room was really small, the bathroom was tiny, and the hotel offered nothing to make you want to spend any time at the hotel. The hotel (or I should say Motel) appears to be quite old and doesn't offer any of the modern touches you look for when deciding where to stay. The room rate ($85.00/night on Fri. &amp; Sat.) was very reasonable compared to the $275.00 to $450.00 nightly weekend rate at the rest of the hotels on the strip. Its a wonder this motel hasn't been torn down yet to make room for another mega resort. If you decide to stay here, just remember: you get what you pay for."
55,307,"Aug 5 2006	Great Stay!!	We stayed here for 4 nights last week. Loved it. Thanks to recommendations from others on the Las Vegas forum, I called the hotel ahead and requested the 3rd floor. We had rooms 311 and 315. Both rooms newly renovated. A/C worked great. No smell of smoke at all.Very clean and the bathroom was renovated as well. We had prime location on the strip, so everything was walking distance.We would stay here again. We paid $63 per night. Great price for the prime location!"
56,307,"Jun 25 2006	Diamond In The Rough	My husband and I just got back from a 3 night stay at the Casino Royale and we LOVED it! It was a smaller casino, but had everything we needed. The rooms were large and clean and provided us with a safe, fridge, and coffee maker. The casino had a large variety of games and using the hotel's club card gave us many fun playing coupons. The hotel pool is smaller, but again big enough to swim laps and adequate space to get some sun. It is open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. One of the other great things about this hotel is the location. It's pretty much right smack dab in the middle of the strip. Restaurants right next door include McDonald's, Panda Express, and Chipotle - Outback Steakhouse connected to hotel. We will be staying here again on our next visit to Vegas and why not with the player's card you can earn free nights."
57,307,"Apr 24 2006	Great location	My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by our stay at Casino Royale. We go to Vegas often but the weekend prices can get exorbinant. You can usually find a reasonable rate here and it is a good deal. The rooms are clean and of a good size. The casino is fun with quick drink service when you are playing. My husband and I won $1500 playing video poker, luck of the draw of course but winning always gives me a favorable impression of a hotel. The only thing I would recommend is requesting a room on the Venetian side. We were on the Harrah's side right by a loading dock and the trucks were rolling in all night, backing up with that loud beep and we got very little sleep.The location is wonderful, close to all the big casinos. We would definitely return."
58,307,"Apr 17 2006	Enjoyed stay	A group of us girls.(bestfriend weekend) stayed here for 3 night. The hotel is off the main road so no noise. Which was great. The rooms are nice, Clean, and well kept. The hotel bar tender Daryl was great..99 margarita...whoooooo..!!Had a great time here. Friend won on penny slots.Would love to go back"
59,307,"Apr 6 2006	OK rooms timeshare ""deal"" a ripoff	We stayed at the casino royale because we were offered a &quot;deal&quot; by the Tahiti Village timeshare company. The rooms were clean - better than I expected. We had constant problems with our room keys, however. Also, I have been charged more than I was promised by the timeshare company, and the free slot machine play they offer must be done only on their &quot;promotional machines,&quot; on which you can not cash out unless you hit a jackpot. One employee told us that they had only seen two winners on these machines the entire time they worked there. These are also the machines that you must play when you join their &quot;club&quot; and get $50 free play. In addition, other offers that the timeshare company promised were not as they were explained to me. Overall, the rooms are fine and a good deal . . . DO NOT book there because you get a &quot;good deal&quot; from Tahiti Village . . . this is a waste of time and is not a good deal - except for the room discount (which I have not yet recieved), the extra stuff they offer is not worth it. If I had to do it over, and could find a room on the strip for 30-40 dollars more a night, I would do it. Otherwise, the room is fine - clean, very basic."
60,307,"Apr 3 2006	Value Value Value	I stayed here for three nights in January and would recommend this to any one that wants good value in themiddle of the strip. Very clean rooms, very standardnot a lot of extras but can't beat it fo location, cleanliness and value. No hesitation to stay here again."
61,307,"Jun 28 2005	Best Buy on the Strip	This hotel is the best buy on the strip. It is certainly not elegant or luxurious, but it is clean and inexpensive. The location can't be beat! Right across from Caesar's and The Mirage. I have stayed there several times, and always enjoyed my stay."
62,307,Jun 8 2005	no frills good deal	A great place for the low roller. Great location and price. Room was older but clean. Not the place if you are seeking up scale LV. But if you want to keep your lodging cost down this is the place to go! Make sure you get a casino card. Very modest play will get you free rooms in the future and comps now!
63,307,"Jun 8 2005	close the tables in vegas?	Visited the casino weekend of june 2-5. Place was filled even at 330 am, but the dealers announced craps tables were closing, and the only one left would be the sit down craps. This place was FULL at 330 with action. Best craps odds in town (100xodds) but the sit-down only has 10x.The craps table near the bar is dirty, and has some duct tape holding the rails. One dealer said that they can not afford to pay OT, so they close tables down. THis is vegas and they close? The Subway was expensive ($8+) for a meal-deal. THis place is in a good location, and they give $50 in free slot play for getting a players card. The pit boss has mine still, they lost it. They can have it! They only bring draft beer to tables, must get bottles at full price at the bar. I can only imagine that this place will be replaced soon."
64,307,"May 11 2005	OK But Not Great	The only reason we stayed there was because some friends we were going to be meeting up with had already chosen the place. We have stayed at Stardust, Riviera and Imperial Palace, so you can see we don't have real expensive tastes. Our first impression was the place is extremely dark and uninviting. We decided before we even checked in that we wouldn't stay there again. I originally made reservations for 3 non-smoking rooms. When I called to cancel one of the rooms, I found that they had reserved 2 non-smoking and one smoking. I'm pretty sure when I asked about AAA or any other discounts I was told there weren't any. When checking in, they asked if anyone in either room had AAA. Only one person had brought their card. Unfortunately, that card could only be used for the room that person was in. So even though there were 2 AAA members in the other room who didn't have their cards, they wouldn't accommodate. The husband of one of the members faxed a copy of their card and on checkout, they almost didn't accept it because HIS name was on the card rather than HERS. They changed it so he was listed as the guest. We found most of the employees there to be not very friendly or particularly helpful. The cashiers are not happy when you request quarters rather than use their new ticket system. In fact, the first time we asked, they told us that only 2 machines in the whole place even took quarters, which is not true. Overall, the rooms were fine - clean and comfortable. It is a very small casino and the rooms are a short walk. The elevator was always right there when we rang for it. We only had to share it once. Also nice, is having so many restaurant choices in one place. Denny's was very accommodating to our 10 person group for breakfast."
65,307,"May 2 2005	Bad experience	We travel to Vegas once a year and enjoy staying at different hotels each time. This was our first and last stay at the Casino Royale. While we are certainly not picky about every little thing, there were too many things here that were unacceptable. We read this site often for the reviews, and in doing so found that you should request one of the newly remodeled rooms on the 4th floor. We did just that. When walking in the room it was very nice. Had a mini-bar with fridge, etc. But the room felt like it was not very clean. We put on a clean pair of socks, walked across the room to the window, and our socks became filthy! Next, beware of the rooms on the right side of the casino (facing the McDonalds). This was where our room was, and it was right above the loading dock. We were kept awake ALL NIGHT due to the beeping, yelling, and other noises associated with a loading dock. We walked outside the next day and observed that there were about 12 rooms from floors 1-4 that would have all had the same situation (the ones nearest the back parking lot). We know the rooms are cheap here, but is this why? The casino itself was nice and small, but very dark and many mirrors. We ourselves were concerned that we would walk into one of the mirrors, and wondered what elderly people with poor eyesight must encounter here... Needless to say, we were booked to stay for 3 nights, checked out, and checked into the Monte Carlo - what an incredible difference! Bottom line, if it is cheap you get what you pay for!"
66,307,"Apr 29 2005	surprised	Was surprised on how clean the rooms were kept, bathrm, clean towels everyday, beds made &amp; all straighted up everyday. Would stay again. Right in the middle of the strip. Only one problem sometimes could enter hotel without pass key, because door left open. Met lots of security walking the halls. next to Dennys for good breakfast. I enjoyed the convenience . Marie, Ronkonkoma, NY."
67,307,"Apr 26 2005	My first trip to Vegas stayed at Casino Royale	We arrived at the Casino Royale around 10:00 Pm. It was a little difficult finding the front desk. Check-in was fast. Our room was clean. Nothing flashy which wasa OK (since I wasn't planning on being in the room too much). The thermostat on the A/C didn't work. It kept turning on and off...on and off...on and off....so I just turned it off.The casino was fun. Like the rooms, nothing flashy but it got the job done. This is a place for the really low rollers like me. Black Jack, roulette, and craps all had low minimum bets. So low, it's hard to get on a table. Food was also cheap with Subway, Denny's and Outback on site. Throw in the $1 Michelobs (Marguaritas had very little if any alcohol) and you've got a low rollers dream.The best thing about the Casino Royale was the location. It was almost in the middle of the strip. It's between Harrah's and the Venetian and across the street from the Mirage and Caesar's. Everywhere was within walking distance and we went to every casino on the strip.All in all, I had a good time. No regrets about staying at the Casino Royale. Except for the A/C, the room was Ok. Service was good and the Casino was made with the little guy in mind. I would recommend Casino Royale if you want a no frills room in a great location."
68,307,Apr 23 2005	No Complaints	We stayed at Casino Royale for 4 nights the end of March. Nothing fancy but the coffee pot in the room was a real plus for us. Quiet and clean. One tip though-ask for a hair dryer at the desk at check in. A bit crowded at the entrance to the rooms with a popular t shirt seller right at the room entrance. Great location with McDonalds next door for quick food. Casino is small and crowded but friendly. Played craps for the first time and staff was helpful. Glad we found this place and would stay here again.
69,307,"Apr 22 2005	Perfect for the price!!	Perfect location, right on the strip by the Venetian, TI, Mirage. Easy-in and -out parking. You can enter and exit on Koval Ave instead of the Strip.I got a smoking room. There was a tiny bit of the smoking-motel-room smell hanging in the air, but not bad at all - much better than the typical crappy motel. Rooms are very close to the casino and to the front desk. No casino noise in the room however! Beds were very comfortable. Room was clean. For late-night food, the casino's Subway was open at 3am. It may be open 24 hours - I don't know.One concern: is the air conditioning system a match for the Las Vegas summer? It was only about 75 degrees during the day when I was there, and I could not get my room cold. I really mean cold, though - I like hotel rooms to be at 62 degrees! I plan to stay again in June and will report on the A/C!"
70,307,"Apr 5 2005	Great place in the middle of all the action!!!!	Stayed here at the Casino Royale and I have to say, &quot; This place is off the chains&quot;. Only problem I had was when I made the reservations for the junior suite they said I would have a wrap around leather couch. It was their error because that is only available for the suite. I told them i was informed wrong and they tried to upgrade me for free but they were completely sold out that weekend. I had the chance to actually see the suite and I am def. going back to stay in there. Great room for the money especially if your splitting the money with a few friends. Junior Suite with 2 rooms, 2 tv's split with 2 other friends came out to $100.00 a piece. 150 a night, you cant beat that. Plus ITS RIGHT ON THE STRIP!!!! you step out and Vegas life is right in front of your eyes. 5 stars if they would of upgrade!!!!!!P.S. Bring an Iron or get yours first they ran out hahahhahhahaaaaa"
71,307,"Mar 30 2005	Perfect place for the younger crowd.	We have been to LV numerous times, staying at hotels such as Excalibur, MGM, Ballys, Imperial Palace and Caesers. This last time we stayed at Casino Royale. I was a little apprehensive of staying there, but my boy friend was insistent. During all of our trips to Vegas, we had ended up playing at this casino the most. The tables are cheap, the drinks are strong, and the slots actually pay out. Anyway, as I said, I was scared there would be cockroaches in my bed and fought with my boy friend over staying there, but he won in the end. People in reviews complained that the front desk was hard to find, and the lines were long and blah blah blah. We arrived there at 9 am, check in is not until 3 pm. They allowed us to check in at 9:30, when they cleaned the room. The room was a nice size, it wasnt Bellagio, but the bed was huge, CA Kind I believe, and really really comfortable. There was a refrigerator, a nice little bar, a closet and a nice size bathroom. The rooms look away from the strip, so you dont hear the noise at night. Also, you are in VEGAS, you are there to play, have fun, walk around see the hotels, honestly how many hours do you really spend in your hotel??? We slept about 5 hours a night, the rest of the time we were enjoying our selves. This hotel houses mainly the younger crowd. Tons of people under 35 mixed in with strong alcoholic drinks makes a really fun atmosphere. Remember, you are there to have fun, not to stay in your hotel room!!!!!! For the price of this hotel, the location of it, and the strong drinks and loose tables and slots, this was an awesome place. We will stay there again next year, and I hate to admit this, but my boy friend was right (for once)!"
72,307,"Mar 29 2005	Location is key	We stayed at the Casino Royale for 2 nights in March 2005 after staying at Mandalay Bay for 6 nights on the same trip. We stayed at Mandalay Bay for a convention but when it was time for me to pay for the last two nights, it was $600.00 + per night. We made the reservations about 5 weeks before the trip and March is a VERY expensive time of the year for Las Vegas. We normally stay at the Flamingo because of the location, but the rooms were about $400.00 per night. We decided to stay at Casino Royale because that is where we spend all of our time gambling every trip anyway.Our room at Casino Royale was about 20 feet from the casino and we could not hear any of the casino noise. The Casino Royale is your basic motel like Motel 6. Don't expect any frills just a clean room. The rooms were average size, but after staying at some of the mega resorts on the strip they seemed small but in compairson to other motels in the US, the room size is about right. I would stay at Casino Royale again because of the gambling and the location. The pool is about the size of my bathtub, so don't expect to spend the day at the pool unless you just want to lay in the sun. The food is average. There is a Subway and Noble Pizza in the casino and a Denny's attached to the casino and an Outback upstairs. We ate at the Outback on another trip and it was very good. I am not a fan of eating at a Denny's on vacation since I don't eat at Denny's at home and as far as the Subway and Noble Pizza in the casino, I choose not to eat at somewhere in the smoke filled casino unless I am drunk. The casino is rather smoke filled which bothers the contacts but that is what"
73,307,"Jan 23 2005 	Short walk to action but bad A/C and heating--	I booked a room here for two nights on last minute's notice during a busy Vegas weekend. My room was clean and decent (Super 8 quality, but larger). I was prepared for a surly staff, but the front desk lady was very pleasant. The hotel is so small that the walk to the casino is wonderfully short; and the door to the strip is about 10 feet away from where the hotel &quot;security&quot; door and the casino meet! My only gripe was that there is no individual climate controls in the rooms. When they have the heating system on (starting in October) the rooms can get very warm if the temp goes above 65 f outside. I had to open my window, but then the noise of the strip will keep you up.The casino is old school Vegas. Very cheap, friendly and great gambling rules (100x odds on Craps and such). A little smokey though. Cheap drinks, but don't eat anything there, walk next door to Harrah's or somewhere else."

2,309,"Sep 29 2009 	Terrible hotel very poor customer service	Me and my girlfriend stayed at this hotel for a 1 night stop over, we found checking in was a nightmare, staff were very rude, they put us in the manor rooms which I would describe as a motel based across the road from the hotel, the rooms were very clean, the only positve thing I can put. The hotel is based for families but could do with an extreme make over. If you are looking at this hotel because of the cheap value, I would recomend paying a bit more and staying at the MGM,"
3,309,"Sep 2 2009 	It's a Circus Circus all right...in all the wrong ways!	I booked at Circus Circus because of the price and the fact that the Manor rooms included a refrigerator for no extra charge. The absence of a &quot;resort fee&quot; was nice as well. This place served its purpose as a place to sleep, store our luggage &amp; rest when not out on the Strip. The down side is that the beds are not all that comfortable and the TV service is minimal, so don't expect to watch more than news or TBS. There are movies (adult &amp; otherwise, I believe), but I didn't watch any of that, so I'm not sure what they cost.Another problem was that I requested a non-smoking room and I believe that my room, while not designated either way, was originally a smoking room, since it had a distinct smoke smell to it. It was an immediate turnoff, but as there was no ashtray, I can't say if the smoking was done on the sly or if the room was designated as &quot;non-smoking&quot; and then not properly cleaned. It wasn't enough of a problem to complain about. When I arrived, there was no refrigerator in the room (despite &quot;all&quot; manor rooms having them according to advertisement). My husband called the front desk and one was sent over fairly quickly, so no problems there. They did have to pull it out of another room, though, so I have a feeling that they are short on fridges.The actual casino and surrounding property, including the main tower, restaurants and the like, is VERY crowded at all times of the day and night. You are forced to walk through a mall-like shopping area on the way to the manor rooms or walk through reception and around the property. The salespeople are very pushy and frequently try to ask you questions or sell you stuff, even when you are dragging luggage and obviously checking out of the hotel. This creates a traffic jam and a lot of delays when trying to move through the hotel. The circus acts are cute, but the bleacher style seating area is cramped and made of hard plastic. It doesn't make you feel very comfortable. the area is small, so most times when you are interested in watching the show, there is no place to sit anyway.I feel that this place might be a good place for parents with kids due to the Adventuredome area and to a lesser degree, the midway and the circus acts, but for childless people in their 30s, this place was too tacky and hectic for our taste. Once in the room it was okay, but there are other places to stay for a similiar price that wouldn't be a zoo. If price is a concern, try downtown or a property off the strip. The bus service is fairly good in Las Vegas and some, like the Orleans, have shuttles. I definitely won't be back and honestly, I think this Circus is on its last legs. To think the owners are the same as the Mandalay Bay is a bit shocking!"
4,309,"Aug 7 2009 	Great value	We were pleasantly surprised with the Manor Motor Lodge. It's a huge room, clean, bath room is great, slightly noisy between rooms. But a great value at $30/night! We weren't here to gamble, just passing through and needed a place for the night."
5,309,"Jul 26 2009 	It's a horrible place worst than motels!	The rooms were not clean and the sheets felt dirty. The beds were horrible, you can feel the springs in the bed. They would put padding on one bed and not the other. When you complain, they switch you to other rooms in the area, but all the Manor rooms had horrible beds. It's worst than sleeping on the floor. When we asked for a room upgrade, they told us everything is completely booked out. After switching to like 5 different rooms, we finally got settled with a full refund and booked at another hotel. Don't ever stay here!"
6,309,"Jul 12 2009 	Good family fun	My wife and I stayed here on the 4th July w/e. Temp reached 42c so the a/c and swimming pools were great. Not in a central part of 'The Strip' but the bus out the front of the casino was great for getting around (a/c'd too!). The rooms were dated, walls between rooms are paper thin (could here conversations from next room) - but comfortable and clean. WiFi was available but at a cost and a bit pricey. Great restaurant choices within the casino. A good choice to stay if you are a family with children. Regular circus acts, a huge double story indoor amusement centre (rides, clowns, etc) Probably wouldn't stay here again but definately a good choice for the budget concious and young family."
7,309,"Jul 8 2009 	The worst	Not a pleasant experience, because of:- Very dirty carpet, - Cushion on one of only two chairs provided (in a room for 4 people) was wet and one of the three lamps wasn't working, - It took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to bring a light bulb and to exchange the disgusting chair with another that was not wet, but quite stained. - We chose the manor room over the main hotel room because it offers a fridge. However, the fridge is small and noisy. - Personal safety concerns:  1. The main entrance door was propped open with a towel as the security lock didn't work. When somebody removed the towel (either unknowingly or because of security concerns) it meant that guests couldn't get back to their rooms.  2. We had drunk people sleep right outside our room lying in the hallway. There was no security provided.We would not stay again no matter how good the deal."
8,309,"Jun 28 2009 	Motel 6 without the amenities	We stayed here with family, ages 19-77. I needed a place where we could be separate from the casinos, but close to the fun so my 77-yr-old mother would not have to walk too much to enjoy the trip. First, we asked for a room on ground floor and were told they couldn't do that, but would put us close to the elevators. They put us right by the stairs but farthest away from the elevators. We had 3 rooms. Two were nice enough and clean. One smelled like something died under the bed. My sister sprayed air freshener every time we opened the door--and the smell never lessened. The beds were hard; you could feel the springs in the mattress. I didn't even know they had springs in mattresses any more. The pillows were flat. Otherwise, everything was nice enough. I didn't notice any stains or dirt or mold. The showers were nice enough.I was most frustrated with the coffee situation. I didn't realize how frustrating it is to have to walk ten miles to get a cup of coffee. At least in Motel 6, you can walk to the lobby in the morning and get a cup. The Manor is a block away from the main hotel--and once you make your way over there, you still have to meander around to find a coffee shop. I didn't mind having to pay for coffee--but it was $2.75, and it was bitter. I thought that this hotel would be a great place for all ages to hang out--but you have to go through the casinos to get anywhere. In fact, at midnight, we saw small children who had apparently won stuffed animals at the midway sleeping in the hallway outside the casinos, sacked out on their new toys. There was no seating anywhere--except in the casinos--so my mom, who is on a walker, couldn't just sit and watch the kids play. In fact, when we were checking in, we stood in line for 40 minutes--and there was no place to sit and wait. I thought the staff were very nice; but it just didn't serve our needs. I will say that 2 out of 3 rooms were nice enough--esp for the price we were paying. And we felt safe enough. (I read one review that mentioned being held up by gunpoint.) We saw bicycle police everywhere. One young man came around asking people for change--but when we said no, he moved on without any threat. Anyone who chooses to stay here should bring his/her own coffee, and be prepared to walk a long way. We drove in--so it was very nice to have our car close by for loading and for moving around the town. I would have hated to have to use the valet service every time we wanted to drive somewhere."
9,309,"Jun 10 2009 	you get wat u pay for	went to manor lodge in circus circus for our 25th wedding anniversary our main part of our holiday was hawaii so only wanted a cheap place to stay and also didn,t want a high rise building. it isn,t to bad the smell that other people hav wrote about is carpet cleaner which they seem to put down on the carpets in the mornings when they r cleaning its only in the first part of the building. there is no kettle or coffee maker in the rooms so if u want one u will hav to take your own. we stayed on the ground floor which wasn,t very good as we didn,t open our curtains as there was a car park right outside our window so everyone could see straight in also the window was bolted up so if u had to get out in an emergency u couldn,t. i wouldn,t stay there again if i went to vegas again i would stay in a different hotel. circus circus is not right on the strip so i would stay closer to everything as a lot of walking or bus rides. the buffets were good in some hotels but not so good in others. we found circus circus was cheap and ok but the mirage, luxor was dearer but better, the excaliber was also nice and not to expensive.we went to grand canyon in helicopter ,heli usa. we had 6 people in the helicopter plus pilot it was very crowded. we went on the ranch wasn,t much to see or do there the only good thing was one cowboy there who sang to us everything was rushed. we brought the dvd they sold which we thought was going to b about us but it was about 5 mins of us then the rest was advertising. the staff in the main part of the hotel weren,t very helpful we tried to make a phone call home as our mobiles wouldn,t work there but noone really wanted to help us with the phones there.be warned don,t walk round all hotels on your first day as u won,t b able to walk again the hotels arn,t as close together as they seem. get the duece bus 15 dollars for a 3 day pass, 7 dollars 24hrs and 3 dollars one way."
10,309,"Apr 25 2009 	Should have stayed at a Motel 6!!	The Circus Manor (slums of circus circus) is a separate building that sits across from the main towers. Upon entering the room two lights did not work. The beds were as if we brought our own cots! The safe had a hole in it and there was no lock. The stench was that of smoke, must and 30 years of drugs, prostitution and mold. We had to take all our luggage and haul it across the street to the manor which was a pain! It is not even relatively close to the casino in the hotel, nor was it close to any strip! So if you want to stay at a place where you could wake up and go down to the casino...do not stay in the Circus Manor. Upon complaining to the front desk, we received a free room upgrade to the main tower where the hotel is. And while that room was significantly better(flat screen tv, kingsize pillow top bed,beautiful scenery and clean bathroom), it is not even close to the glamor rooms of better more upscale hotels on the strip. The Manor rooms were like a bad dream and my spouse and I were scared of being mugged while walking back and forth from the &quot;main&quot; hotel. Word of advice...DO NOT STAY HERE! Spend the extra cash to enjoy your stay, otherwise it will ruin your vacation. I can see why the circus is free, they needed to provide more incentive!"
11,309,"Mar 27 2009 	Needs to be demo	I have stayed in some motels that looked, smelled and felt better than this &quot;hotel&quot;. My husband wanted to surprise me with a last minute trip to Vegas. He booked everything, the Circus Circus Manor was the cheapest &quot;hotel&quot; he could find. Once we arrived I noticed why. The bed sheets were dirty, the room smelled like [--] just bad!"
12,309,"Feb 15 2009 	If you smoke this is your place.	First let me pointout we were staying at CC just for the night as we drove thru Vegas on our way to Disneyland. Needless to say we were looking for something inexpensive. You surely get what you pay for.First impressions are scarey as the parking lot was a circus to get thru. The crowd of people walking around was also scarey. You could pick out the prostitutes waiting in the lobby for their Jon. We choose not to eat at any of the restaurants within and instead drove across freeway to eat at Macaroni Grill (very nice). Landry's was next door. Check in was not so bad until we got to our room (in main tower)and the keycards would not work. We had to go back to the front desk 2 times in attempt to fix the problem. After the 3rd try they ended up upgrading us to a nicer room in the West tower. The registeror commented they were over booked by 60 rooms. While to the room was clean and nicely decorated, it was so smokey we could hardly breathe. Anytime you see an ashtray in the bathroom it is not a good sign. I travle with feebreze and candles and that still did not help the smell. The air conditioner worked good but my husband felt it brought in more smoke. Suprisingly the beds were very comfortable and the pillows were even goose-down. We had a good night sleep until our kids woke us up at 6:30am raring to go. We took advantage of the chance to check out early and get on the road again to our final destination. We ate breakfast at the Denny's across the street on Vegas Blvd. Service good and fast..We did not go on any of the rides since we were taking kids to Disneyland the next day."
13,309,"Jun 10 2008 	I'll Never Stay Here Again	Stayed here for two nights in June. The &quot;manors&quot; are back behind the actual casino and hotel. Walking back there at night was a scary experience. The rooms themselves were in terrible condition -- bad beds, carpet stains, missing fixtures, etc. In addition, the Circus Circus is so far away from everything, that you are much better off just spending an extra $50 or so a night and staying some place nicer and further down the strip. Just getting to the hotel from the manors is a walk. I will never stay there again."
14,309,"May 7 2008 	You get what you pay for..simple as that.	It really is not as bad as people claim, sure it is old and needs repairs, and updating but so would you if you had that many people tromping all over you day in and day out!! YES there are a lot of kids there. We stayed in the Manor B main floor over New Years 2007, with our 2 teenagers(15 yr olds) and infant daughter, the teenagers enjoyed it, they had the chance to go and check out the AdventureDome and had a good time on the rides and with the games. We had considered staying in the towers but once we got to the hotel I am glad we did not, it is a complete zoo to park, to get on the elevator, in the Manor rooms you park your own vehicle and you can park it where you can see it from your room. Check in: only took about 10 mins, we were pre-registered and had no problems with lost registration etc, we had our confirmation letter with us and it was smooth sailing. And we checked in on the 29th of December, which is one of the busiest days to check in at the CC.Our Room: Like I said it was in Manor B, the room was very large, everything worked, altho the toilet was a bit noisy, the towels were white and fluffy, not dungy or dirty, worn etc. The sheets and bed spreads were clean and the beds were comfortable(no springs poking out), we had clean towels each and every day, and the room cleaned and vacuumed every day. The few times we called housekeeping(to get more towels or pillows and a new bedspread after baby peed on the other one)it was delivered our room in plastic with in 20 mins. Nothing was stolen out of all our luggage, and trust me we had a lot as we were at the end of a month long trip, so we had purchased a lot of things and brought it all in our rooms in rubbermad totes as we did not want to leave it in the truck as we went about our sightseeing. There was security at each door of the Manor and they did not let anyone in that did not have a card. The room walls are a bit thin so you can hear the tv in the room next to you, but for the most part it did not matter, we were not there that much other then to sleep and when we finally did get back we were too tired to care. The bathroom was very very clean, I was not worried about putting my 6 mos old baby in the tub at all. Check out went just as fast as the check in, and there is a $1.00 day charge for the phone. We had pre paid the hotel bill in order to get the reduced rate for the 4 nights we stayed there, so we were wondering how many extras would be added, but it was only the phone, so we were happy to see that was the only charge! All in All...you get what you pay for, if you don't like kids stay away, if you don't like average run of the mill rooms in a busy hotel, don't book the manor rooms!"
15,309,"Mar 31 2008 	Far old outdated 	First let me say that Circus Circus is on the Vegas Strip but far from the &quot;real Strip&quot; action. So you either have a rental car or be prepared to wait long for the bus or walk long distances to everywhere. There is a whole block under construction that is scarry to walk at night.We stayed on the Manor motel section as it was cheaper, and yes, it was cheap, you get what you paid for - and less! We had the kids with us and thought that Circus Circus would be a good location for 'family oriented&quot; attractions. The adventurdome (ndoor amusement park on premises) is somewhat OK, however, it is starting to show some evidence of aging and the same neglect you see in the rest of the hotel. Swimming pools are small for the size of the hotel and not anything extraordinary. Rooms were smelly, uncomfortable beds, rusty fixtures in bathroom, safe not working, missing pictures on wall. Non-smoking section, that is a joke, it is within the same building where the smoking section is and the two sections are only separated by a door. Next to two streets with a lot of traffic and noise. You would be better off by staying at the Excalibur or on an off-strip hotel. Do not come without a car if traveling with kids, it would be too much walking for them."
16,309,"Mar 2 2008 	Over priced Staff is Rude Dirty	Well first off we go to check in and they tell me no kids are suppose to stand because of the machines ok so what was i going to do leave my 7 yr old outside while i checked in. Than my mother in law had to use the restroom so me and my son waited by the door of the rest room 2 security gaurds comes over and tells me once again no kids to stand because of the machines ok well than he says its on non stopping zone alright well how did i know where are the stopping zones.so i tell the secutity i only booked this place for my son since it has rides,games had lots to do for kids. He says well this is not a kids place, ok i understand it is a casino but if you where not trying to attract the kids why would you put a roller coaster in , a water ride ex tell me what 60yr old person wants to go on a roller coaster.So than we go to our room now i have to tell you my father in law is handicap and my mother in law has bad knees they give us a room that we had to walk through the whole darn place felt like a mile.than we are put up on the highest floor. when we opened the door it looked like a 24 hr place where you bring a fling, it was dirty smelly and the carpets where all stained. We complained and they did give us another room which was very nice.But than we decide to eat in the pizza place , well you have to cross the gaming floor to get to the pizza place what do you know the security officers want to come over to yell again about no kids on the gaming floor , how the yeck can we get to the pizza place without going across the floor.It was a complete let down the whole place. For one all the time i got yelled at about the gaming floor i don't even gamble, i came to this hotel for my son.Its not a very friendly place to stay at all. Another thing for the guard saying its not a kids place their sign has a clown holding a lollipop,rollercoaster,water ride and sponge bob movie i don't know of any adult that watches sponge bob for the yeck of it we all end up watching sponge bob because of the kids.my mother in law and father in law did not want to go to circus circus for the rides or the video games or the sponge bob movie.They came for their grandson.I will never ever recommend this dump to anyone.Plus one of the staff sad no speak english, well i don't speak spanish so before they get a job there they should be able to speak english considering this is america and if i went to another country i would have to try to learn their language."
17,309,"Jan 15 2008 	Absolutely completely disgusting	You know you're in for an interesting experience when you tell a cab driver to take you to Circus Circus Manor, and he spends the 15 minute ride making fun of the place and pitying you. That happened to me last week. The rooms? Totally disgusting. My colleague found a cigarette butt on the bedspread in her non-smoking room, while my room featured ripped sheets on the bed, questionable brown stains on the bathroom linoleum, and a moldy shower. While this &quot;hotel's&quot; run-down appearance and poorly-lit hallways may seem &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;exciting&quot; to some, it's pretty much unacceptable for non-Third-World travellers. In retrospect, I should have found a nice bathroom stall at the Venitican and camped out there for a few days--it definitely would have been cleaner."
18,309,"Dec 27 2007	Disgusting Dump	I am an Australian and we are a very tolerant people,and will put up with a lot of crap,we stayed in about 30 different motels while on our holiday in the good old USA.and most were pretty good value and clean... but this was by far the most disgusting dump we had stayed &quot;super 8 and motel 6 are better this dump ,,,,do yourself a huge favour and stay elsewhere ....and they have the hide to charge you more than double the rate for a weekend , we paid $221 for one night in there manor rooms (filthy smelly)would have been better to stay in the car or a public toilet somewhere ..........a bad bad horrible experience ...never again This dump needs to be demolished."
19,309,Aug 27 2007	Great stay	Through our travel agent we paid 100 dollars for a room. The complex is huge. There are many resturants in the complex and its located right on the strip.The room was very clean and tidy and I got an adequate nights sleep. The room had a lot of space too.I remember the bathroom taps being hard to work.
20,309,"Aug 20 2007	Checked in.....checked out	We booked a room at Circus circus after staying at another hotel for 3 days. We had a very late flight and thought for $90 we had a place to stay for the day. The early check in at 11am took over 1 hour in line. We then got our keys and were given a map to the 2nd Manor building. It was over 105 degrees and we had to gather the luggage thru the parking lots, then to the 2nd building.I was shocked. The building smelled, was dirty...I felt very sorry for the families I saw....this is a vacation? Our room had dirty chairs...the bathroom was rusted and moldy, I have never seen anything like it. We checked out and spent the day at the airport. It was a much better choice. I am shocked that anyone would think these substandard conditions are OK. I called the management when we returned home. I explained we did not go back to the desk because we were unable to speak to anyone unless we stood back in the hour long line. No one shoud stay here...it was terrible."
21,309,"Aug 17 2007 	Filthy rowdy and a bit scary!	Stayed here for one night with a friend. I was supposed to be there my entire stay in Las Vegas, and after my experience I am glad I found someone else to stay with! Another friend and I arrived at almost midnight to be greeted at the entrance by unsupervised delinquent children of all ages, some of which (the teenagers) were being escorted from the building for their misbehavior. There was vandalism all over the grounds. The smell of smoke was profound in the main building, and the manor buildings smelled smoky and musty. Had I not been so completely exhausted after we came back from more gambling at around 4 am, I wouldn't have been able to sleep in the dump. The springs in the bed jabbed against my side, and the sheets didn't seem clean. I made the unfortunate choice of planning on showering there. The bathroom was simply unacceptable - not just out-of-date but in disrepair and filthy. I have stayed in hostels that I'd sooner shower in bare feet. The towels were paper thin and looked to be decades old, with a disgusting greyish-brown tint to the nap, as if they hadn't been properly cleaned. The locks were the standard programmable key-card type, but I didn't feel secure either about access to the building itself or to the rooms. I had no idea what to expect, as my friend made the booking; I didn't know how much he paid for the room until afterwards... Even for the dirt-cheap rates he got ($70/night) there is no excuse for the condition of the rooms. Had I known, I would have chucked in a few extra bucks to get him to stay somewhere better.Felt like I was going to contract a disease every time I touched a surface in this place.If you really need to save money, stay a block or two off the strip at Holiday Inn or something similar. If you can't afford to stay somewhere a little nicer ($130 a night) then you don't need to be visiting Las Vegas...believe me, you will regret a stay at this hotel."
22,309,"Mar 20 2007 	Great staff/service/super on a budget	For all the people who complained, wah, wah, this is for people on a budget, we found the service great, the staff friendly, &quot; you might try smiling yourself&quot;, eh? Never had a problem getting to the hotel, checking in was a breeze, our grand-kids has a super time, and all the while we enjoyed watching them have fun, we don't gamble at all, we just enjoy Las Vegas! Stop whining when you do not get the &quot;five star&quot; treatment, just go someplace else next time, sheesh.. Circus/Circus, we'll be back, thanks for a great time!! The food was tasty, well done. Pizza at the Grill has ton's of cheese on it, and was done in record time, speg. was also great, not too spicy nor too bland. McDonalds was a plus on the premises as the kids loved it, service always with a smile. Shops , clowns, and entertainment well worth the trip."

Plastic disposable cups!5. &quot;No Unloading&quot; sign at the lobby entrance, but the valets will actually reluctantly give you 5 minutes, after which they will &quot;politely&quot; tell you to shove off and that &quot;you're responsible if anyone hits your car.&quot;6. Noisy in-room HVAC.7. One of three lifts working in the cramped and almost always near full garages.8. Talking an elevator to the second floor from the main lobby, crossing the Promenade, and walking thru the main casino to get to the only elevators leading to the Skyrise Tower.9. SLOW SLOW SLOW check-in. Took us 10 minutes at the counter, and we had a pre-paid reservation! What was the clerk doing with all that furious typing?10. I got exactly what I paid for, which was not much."
24,309,"Dec 2 2006 	How did that alarm clock get turned on?	We stayed at Circus-Circus for 6 nights in mid November.2 years ago, I stayed in their RV park, during my honeymoon. The Manor location is adjacent the RV park, and is about 5 minutes walk to the strip. As the C-C complex is at the northern end of the Strip, it was ok for me and my wife to walk, but on this visit we were accompanied by my very fit 75 year old mother, who found the walking distance to the centre of the Strip a little far at times.So if you're not a walker, and want to stay somewhere more &quot;central&quot;, maybe consider another hotel.Although a Non-Smoking room had been requested, we got what was obviously a smoking room, however after 2 days leaving the window open when we were away, it became acceptable.The toilet seat had seen plenty of use through the years! So much in fact, that the white plastic coating had worn off, and the laminated wood was showing through.There was mildew growing in the bathroom.One of the beds in the room had springs sticking through the top of the mattress. My mother had to make sure she slept only on one side of her bed.We were meant to receive about 13-17 TV channels. We only got 5. One played the in-house advertisement channel all the time, and another played constant re-runs of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, cutting down the watchable choices to 3.We asked if it could be re-tuned, but this obviously was too unimportant or too tiring for the staff. We gave up asking in the end.The ice-maker on our floor didn't work.The safe didn't lock. The towels were very thin and worn, and smelt burnt.In our hurry to get out of the room one day, and begin the days activities, we forgot to leave a tip.As the week continued, we had no wash-cloths, cups or plastic bags for ice.For some strange reason the alarm clock went off at 4am the following day. How Odd.Obviously the maid staff at Circus-Circus are actually too lazy to do their job, even though they're being paid a hourly rate for it. Tip or else!Obvious too, that if you forget to leave a tip, the vindictive staff turn the radio alarm on to give you that early wake-up call.Overall, the Circus-Circus Manor wasn't dirty or noisy, but was in need of a make-over and coat of paint. (Or demolition.)The staff at check-in / out in the main building were friendly and helpful, although we only had contact with them on those two occasions.Danger! Danger! Watch out for the HUGE meals, listed as an &quot;appetiser&quot; on the menu! I had some nachos one night - I got through about 1/3 of the plate. On another evening I requested the fruit platter - that was taken in a doggy bag, and fed 3 of us for a snack the following day!I would say our visit was only disappointed by lazy household staff who think vindictive revenge is appropriate, if you forget to leave a tip on one day of a 3 week holiday."
25,309,"Nov 29 2006 	You do get what you pay for.	I stayed in the Manor when visiting Vegas with my parents and cousin.We requested two interconnecting non smoking rooms and this was exactly what we got. Check in only took 10 mins, 7 of those were the clerk trying to find suitable rooms.Rooms were clean, fridges both worked. Aircon was a little noisy but then it was only really needed during the day. Bathrooms are small but functional.There are no coffee making facilites but we just went to wal-mart and bought a kettle and 4 mugs. Morning cup of tea problem solved for less than $20.Housekeeping was very good, extra pillows requested turned up in 10 mins, sheets changed when card placed on them. Maintanence were equally swift, a fault with the aircon was reported at 1800 and fixed by the time we came back at 2200.Safe in room eats a quarter every time you lock it and didn't look like it would take much to get into it, but since we put our passports in the main hotel cage this wasn't really a problem.Not all the TV channels worked, but then we didn't spend an awful lot of time in the rooms watching TV!Didn't use the pool but there were plenty of kids in there the night before thanksgiving and they seems to be enjoying themselves!It is a fair walk to the main casino but there are walkways to assist. We liked the fact that you can park the car right outside the block rather than the 3 mile hike through the casino to the multi story car park.No problems checking out.The manor isn't fancy, and it is starting to show it's age slightly, but it is cheaper than some of the more overblown hotels at the top end of the strip. If you have a car like we did (and even better, a non-drinker in your party) then this is a great place to stay if you are on a budget."
26,309,"Oct 18 2006	Sorry Folks Park is Closed - The Moose Out Front Should Have Told You!	In keeping with the Themed Hotel experience in Vegas, the Circus Circus Manor did a wonderful job of making me feel like I was staying in a Slum. Apparently Vegas was broken in general on this trip. But for this review, Ill stick to the items at this property exclusively.Broken Item #1  card key reader at Manor Building E front entrance. RESOLUTION: prop door open with bucket so card key not necessary for entrance to buildingBroken Item #2  room safe did good job of taking my quarter  bad job of letting me remove the key to lock it. RESOLUTION: Get different room or live w/o a safe according to their maintenance men staff. (we gladly took a different room in the hotel tower)Broken Item #3  Adventure Dome leaks badly from recent rains. RESOLUTION: a strategic placement of painters buckets and caution tape. Broken Item #4  Skyway Shuttle to take us from the back of the hotel to the front RESOLUTION: noneBroken Item #5  about  the escalators. RESOLUTION: take the stairsBroken Item #6  soda vending machine took my money, did not dispense beverage. RESOLUTION: None  but I did have some kids point and laugh at me telling me its broken. Apparently I was not the only one who got the raw end of this deal. good times - thanks kids!Broken Item #7 - Fire alarm in the Adventure Dome and surrounding shops and resturaunts was tripped resulting in near deafness and epileptic seizures from the stobing effect.Other items that werent really broken but were not up to par were disgusting shower curtains / moldy shower grouttoilet that leaned to the left.stinky towels"
27,309,Oct 6 2006 	Too far from everything	This motel was very basic. The walk to the main hotel is long. The pool was just your basic pool. Its very hard to go back to this ho hum place after visiting the beautiful hotels of Las Vegas.I would NOT go back to this motel.
28,309,"Sep 14 2006 	Great for a Vegas trip on a Budget.	I went to Las Vegas and stayed in the B building of the Manor lodge of Circus Circus. The actual hotel room wasn't too bad. It had a refrigerator, a table, a tv, wireless internet, and the bathroom was decent. The rates were amazing, and it allowed me to spend more money on my outings. The pool was pretty nice. There were three seperate pools which spread out the groups of people. If you are looking to eat on a budget the casino has many cheap places to eat. The casino is at the end of the strip so to get to all the new hotels it is best to take the bus. I rode the Duce bus which ran 24hours and returned to the bus stop every 15 minutes. It is $5 for a 24hour pass, which keeps it resonably cheap. I wouldn't reccomend this hotel for someone who is looking for a fancy new place, and to be in the center of the strip. I would reccomend this hotel for someone like me who needed to travel to vegas cheaply. It is much nicer than other hotels in its price range."
29,309,"Aug 18 2006 	Not bad but lock up your valuables.	It's a bit of a family tradition to stay at Circus Circus for us each time we have visited Vegas since 1994. Previously we had stayed in the Tower rooms and the RV park, but decided this time on the Manor because we had a rental car for the entire length of stay. I have to say that the rooms are bigger than the Tower's and are quite clean and nicely decorated, they also have a Refrigerator which you don't get in the tower's, but unfortunately no Microwave or Internet connection. Having to go to the main building to check in and out is a nuisance, but once you are there at least you don't have to drag suitcases through the midway and the casino which is a big plus. As neither my daughter or myself are gamblers, we didn't miss having to walk through a smoke filled Casino every time we left our room. However, prospective guests beware, we did have items of newly purchased clothing go &quot;missing&quot; from our room, so I would recommend keeping your suitcases LOCKED and keep money and valuables with you. We contacted 'Security' who were very uninterested and advised that it was unlikely they would find the &quot;missing&quot; items, they issued a Report number only on my insistance, which I will need to claim on my travel insurance.If you want fancy Pools with slides and stuff this is not for you, also if you don't have your own transport, stay further towards the middle of the strip. This is one of the older hotels and the local rumour is that it's days are numbered, along with a few others nearby, but I think the theme is good, so hopefully they will re-build it with all the &quot;Bells and whistles&quot;."
30,309,"Jul 25 2006 	Nice hotel wrong location.	I go to Las Vegas every year. My first experience was in October 2004 and my fianc and I stayed at Circus Circus. The rooms were very nice, but location wise, it was definitely the wrong choice for us. We spent much of our time walking or busing to the other end of the strip. The only time we actually were in the hotel was to sleep or eat. I will not stay at Circus Circus based only on this. It was a nice hotel, with nice staff, and nice rooms. I did however get lost a couple of times trying to get to my room. The price is right, the buffet is okay. It all depends on a persons plans while in Vegas. If this hotel was up the strip more, I would probably stay again. If you do stay here, make sure your room is not near the circus tent at all. I think this would be a fabulous hotel if we had children. Kids would have a blast in this hotel. If you are going to Vegas for the first time, do some research. Plan out what you want to do and stay close to the things you want to do and see. I wish I had."
31,309,"Jul 24 2006	Would not stay there again	I stayed at the Circus Circus Hotel, Manor Suites (which is separate from the Tower (the main building) for a show my son was a part of 4th of July weekend 2006. First off, let me say that the manor suites are like staying at a motel. There is a totally separate facility, parking lot, buildings, pool, etc., which was extremely inconvenient considering the 115 degree weather. If you want to go eat, you have to cross the street to the main building, if your key gets lost or if they go bad, you have to cross the street, if you need anything, you have to cross the street to the main tower to see concierge, front desk support; if you want to go gambling or to eat, and the list goes on and on, again you have to cross walk across the parking, cross the street, go through the indoor parking lot then to the main tower. The rooms have just beds and a phone, no pamphlets or brochures for advice on the areas attractions, etc. The pool area was crowded, the pool was cloudy and there was nothing fancy about it, no water fall, diving board, slide, nothing. Just hot concrete, and warm water, and even that is a treck from the manor rooms. The service by every employee I came into contact with was average, non-helpful and sometimes rude, everyone from maid servers, amusement park personnel, front desk employers and even a manager. When I mentioned some issues to the manager she said &quot;oh sorry&quot;, but never offered any compensation whatsoever, not even a comment card, I had to ask for one and then was pointed to where I could find it. All in all, I would not recommend this hotel room, especially not a manor room to anyone, not to sure what the Tower (the main building) rooms had to offer."
32,309,Jun 29 2006	Not the family friendly place it makes out to be	We decided to stay at the circus circus hotel as we have a 21mth old infant. Afterall they do advertise as a family friendly hotel. After queuing for over an hour to check in we eventually got to our rooms which didnt even have a fridge. In 40 plus heat with an infant the least you would expect in your hotel room is a fridge !. The net curtains were badly stained and the beds felt like they had no mattresses on them. We stayed here as part of a self organised tour of the west coast and nevada and I have to say it was the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. We then had to queue again (for over 40mins) to check out as the &quot;express checkout&quot; facility on the TV was not available. I really would not reccommend this hotel to ANYONE travelling to Las Vegas. It is badly in need of updating. There are too many other Faboulous places to stay for little or no extra.
33,309,"May 18 2006	easy parking.	Easy parking. Unlike most other hotels, you can easily park your car in front of the Manor buildings and walk to/reach your room within a minute. It's old, yes. But you can't beat the parking...."
34,309,"May 3 2006 	Clean spacious great for budget travellers.	This was my first trip to Las Vegas and after reading all the awful reviews on this hotel I was really not looking forward to my stay at Circus Circus. I stayed at the Manor Motor Lodge as it was the only one with vacancy during the NAB convention. The room was very clean, no weird smells, no weird stains. Being able to park in front of my room in a well lit parking lot was very convenient. I would say upper-scale MOTEL quality is the best way to describe this place. The clown channel on tv was rather freakish but I've seen worse. As long as you're not expecting golden toilets and silk towels, this hotel/motel is OK."
35,309,"Apr 5 2006	Circus Circus---Never stay at the Manor	Circus Circus has a &quot;budget&quot; section that is not properly described. The Manor at Circus Circus is in such a state of disrepair it is unbelievable. Stains in carpet, fans in bathroom that do not work, beds with painful springs, honestly, this place was worse than a LOW budget chain. Yeah, they were cooperative, but they had to move us 3 TIMES, and apologized profusely, talk about embarrasing.  Apparently they are tearing The Manor down within the next 2 years. I've stayed at Best Western, Motel 6, Holiday Inn, La Quinta, etc. SO much better. Apparently the management has deemed it unnecessary to make repairs to certain areas, i.e., the escalators, elevator, ice machines, and so on. We were utterly dissapointed with our stay, even though we were only in the room for an average of 4 hours per night. Next time we go for the NASCAR races, we will get the Package with a better Hotel, possibly TI. From Washington state---------Scott"
36,309,"Apr 2 2006	One SNAFU but otherwise okay	I couldn't get a room at the Hilton because it and almost everywhere else had the day I was arriving as a &quot;no arrival&quot; day, so I was kind of desperate. Finally, I booked a Manor room at the Circus Circus through an online service for the first night and then got a reservation at the Hilton the rest of the visit. Fortunately, I printed and took with me the online service's email confirming my reservation and the fact that the room was paid for in advance and unrefundable, because when I got to the Circus Circus, they had no record of me having a reservation. They did give me a room, though, and by the time I checked out, they had figured out what was wrong and didn't charge me anything. Well, except that silly $1.00 surcharge for the phone. Why don't they just include that in the room rate?I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It was very large and comfortable. The bed was reasonably comfortable and there was like a dinette table with chairs, too. The only frustrating thing was that the cable TV had only like 4 channels (Headline news, ESPN, TBS, and something else) besides the hotel's in house channels. Who doesn't have CBS, NBC, and ABC on their hotel TV cable???The porters were very, very helpful.I would stay here again if I needed to. It's not my first choice, but it did in the pinch."
37,309,"Jan 8 2006	8 Days @ Circus Circus	Our party of 8 arrived in Las Vegas on Dec. 4 for a week and took up 4 rooms in the West Tower. Our $40 room was on the 10th floor immediately above the check in counter. Apart from a bit of initial confusion over which elevator to take our stay was quite pleasant. Our room was clean and well appointed, the only disappointment was the limited view of the roof of the amusewment park. Not a big deal. The rest of our party had no complaints about their rooms. The hotel was fairly quiet in spite of the rodeo finals taking place that week and the only busy day was the Saturday. We patronized the buffet for breakfast most mornings and it was fine although like much of Vegas nowadays it's not overly cheap. I have stayed at this hotel in the past in the cheaper Manor rooms and have never had any trouble with the property of any sort. We checked out the Strato Tower one afternoon and on hearing that we were staying at CC the elevator guy said, &quot;C'mon now, I hear the rooms there are real dumps.&quot; Sorry, partner, no such luck on the 10th floor."
38,309,"Jul 4 2005	Very good hotel for the money(booked early)great buffet!!	Our family of 4 stayed in the manor building..It was very comfortable-2 queen beds.. This was a busy place when you first check-in but it was worth it!! The buffet was excellent, the kids have the indoor roller coasters and the circus shows, the adults have the casinos..OVERALL an EXCELLENTHOTEL with many extras.. We booked the internet rate and felt it was More than a bargain for the price we paid."
39,309,"Apr 29 2005	Vegas 2005	I had the pleasure of visiting Las Vegas again this year, but this time, I stayed at Circus Circus. I stayed in one of the Manor Rooms, which was quite a distance from the main casino (my mother was not pleased, she has trouble walking long distances). Since it was late when I checked in, I had to wait until the next morning. I went to the front desk and asked if there was another room available in one of the Towers. The only room they had was a smoking room (we don't smoke), but you couldn't tell that it was a smoking room. Once we moved into our new room the stay was very very enjoyable. I even strolled the Midway, I felt like a kid again. Even though it was a long way from the newer hotel casinos, the trolley was available. We also visited The Orleans, my mother and my sister said they had come home to roost. Circus Circus is a great place, especially if you have children. I would stay there again. I plan to visit Vegas annually."
40,309,"Mar 29 2005 	Vegas is a rip	My hubby &amp; I just returned from a convention in Las Vegas staying at Circus Circus. Our room was on the 14th floor of the skytower. It was neat and clean, had fresh towels each day, and quiet. We were pleased with our room and service. The only thing I didn't like was the fact we had no coffee maker in our room. Had to go downstairs from the 14th floor to the Krispy Kreme shop each morning. Took about 20-30 minutes to get down and back. But Las Vegas in general is another story. What a rip. Talk about expensive. This town used to be reasonable. Not any more. Hardly any free drinks. They cut down on the cocktail waitresses coming around the slot machines, takes about an hour till they come around again, because they want you to go up to the bars and buy your drinks. No cash coming out the machines, you get vouchers to cash in. No more using the coins that come out the machines, they want you to keep digging in your wallet. No coffee makers in rooms like I previously mentioned. We sat down at the bar at New York New York for a drink and the barmaid said we won't get free drinks until we put $10 in the machines at the bar. We drank our $8 mix drinks and left. The coaster atop New York New York is $12.50 to ride one time, $25.00 for all day. It's hard to find a bus at night. Sat for almost 1 hour one evening when it was cold and windy. The Blue Iguana restaurant inside Circus Circus is closed 2 nights a week due to cutting labor. C'mon it's Vegas. Restaurants shouldn't close. It's not that there isn't enough of customers. Even Hoover Dam now charges. Five bucks to park and $10 for the boring tour. I've seen all of Hoover Dam I'm gonna see. We had a great time but it's way too expensive for my wallet. Vegas has seen the last of me for a very long time."
41,309,"Jan 5 2005	What a dump	We stayed in 3 hotels over Xmas and this one was the worst!!! Would not stay there again, way better across the street to the Riveria. I called them from the tourist office in Prim, paid $80 and got this crap hole. Stay away at all cost!!!!!!"
42,309,"Dec 4 2004	It Sucks	We booked two rooms with Circus Circus recently. We were charged $90/- per room and we were given Manor Motor Lodge building E.Both rooms were poorly maintained, dusty and the bed spreads had stains in them. I had never seen anything as dirty as these rooms. When I walked back to the reception (and this was late in the night), the receptionist said you get what you paid for. The manager was as rude.I will never stay with them again. You can't get anything worse."
43,309,"Sep 18 2004	YUCK!	This place was such a horrible dump. It smelled old, smoky and like urine, there were very questionable people there and when we were trying to check in we had to park on a high level and walk down through grafitti ridden staircases because the elevator did not work. I wouldn't let my family sit on anything and we demanded our prepaid 1st night back as we refused to stay even one minute in such a ****heap of a motel. I am not even mentioning the surly women in the parking area. We had just stayed in a wonderful hotel in Anaheim, this was a real shock. Don't stay here!"
44,309,"Aug 13 2004	Not as bad as made out to be by previous reviewers!!!!	We just got back from Las Vegas today!!! The manor rooms were certainly more than adequate.They were older but very clean.The manor rooms have parking right outside which was very convenient.There is a small dorm size frig which is great for keeping milk or sodas in or formula if you have a baby.The room was very inexpensive,low $40's for 2 adults,2 kids.If you don't like or have children then Circus Circus isn't the place for you.Another hotel would probably better meet your needs.The circus acts are a bit short,but my 10 yo daughter liked them.The Adventure Dome was fun and an ok deal using the coupon book provided @ check in.It was about $36 for my daughter and I to get the unlimited rides pass.I am 40 yo but even I had a good time laughing w/my daughter.The pool was crowded but in 100+ weather what pool wouldn't be crowded?We didn't eat in any of the hotel except for in the Adventure Dome and then only snacks.Overall,Circuc Circus is an enjoyable place to go if you're going on a FAMILY vacation."
45,309,"Aug 10 2004	DUMP!	Circus Circus is a dump! The walls are paper thin. Even though we were in a non-smoking room, we could smell smoke. The cleaning staff was noisy. Way too many kids! If you want to take your kids on vacation, go to Disney World! I'll never stay here again."
46,309,"Jun 3 2004	Better than expected Fun	We were pleased with Circus Circus and the manor room was better than we expected. Room was clean, not too large but decent. The property is certainly older but well presented and the rate was a bargain. Noise isolation from room to room seemed very good. It was a plus to be able to park so close to the room as well. The kids enjoyed the midway acts and games, not bad if you be sure to use the Fun Books. The Adventure Dome and rides looked great although we did not wind up using it. The Westside Deli offers jumbo hotdogs, huge Donuts and a massive Stawberry Shortcake for just $1.50 each.The north strip location is a bit remote, better if you have a car here.Our only gripes were the much too plump pillows, bring your own and the pool closing at 6:00 PM. Absurd to throw out the guests from the pool when still blazing hot.All in all, we feel we did well at Circus Circus."
47,309,"Apr 20 2004	Good value espcially if you're driving your car	My boyfriend and I stayed here in the summer or 2002 (I know. I'm late with this review.) It was a great Vegas room. The room was large, quiet and clean. Because of the Motor Lodge set-up, we easily parked in front of our entrance. We didn't have to deal with walking through the casino or the large hotel to get to the room--it was only seconds from the car to the room. It's also easy to drive to from the strip. Because it's Vegas, we weren't in our room much at all. This was the perfect place to crash. I've stayed at the MGM Grand before and liked the CC Motor Lodge much better. It's more practical if you're out and about exploring Sin City."

3,316,"May 22 2009 	Good ""off strip"" base	We chose somewhere off the strip as we wanted to explore the wider area and would only be going on the Las Vegas Strip at night. I find the large strip hotels annoying and confusing and just wanted somewhere to sleep and shower. The hotel was good value"
4,316,Apr 23 2009 	Good for the busines traveler who doesn't need any frills or extras	Pros: Has a daily shuttle to Mandalay Bay and the airport. Far enough off the strip to miss the traffic. Great staff. Nice full breakfast with made to order eggs
5,316,Apr 22 2009 	Nice new hotel but plane noise!	We stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights on a 'road trip' from California as part of our six week trip to the US last summer. The hotel is new

7,316,Jun 25 2008 	Great experience!	I travel VERY often for work but was in Las Vegas for a wedding. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The front desk staff and dining staff were more than accomodating. The room seemed clean. There is a shuttle every 1/2 hour going to the LV strip. I would definitely stay there again.

11,316,Nov 30 2007 	Great	The hotel was very comfortable in general
12,316,Oct 10 2007 	Convenient Clean and Cozy Inn	*Conveniently located next to the I-15 near the Mandalay Bay Convention Center.*The room was clean and the bathroom was spacious.*Parking is right in front and around the inn
13,316,Sep 9 2007 	Ideal and decent location to stay with family	The hotel is best suited for tourists with family(&amp; kids).They have ample parking space .The front desk is very courteous &amp; knowledgable about local tourist attractions in vegas(also its vicinities) and suggest you how to get around w/o being duped by so called guides/tours.Rooms are spotlessly clean with neat linens.But the refrigerator in room is too small to accomodate more than 3-4 cans of beer.bathrooms are tidy and tub/shower combination have a granite counter to sit or pamper yourself at the rear end .Their complimentary toilet kit didnt have a showercap.Will definitely stay in marriott in vegas or elsewhere.Couldnt find a better accomodation than this one in vegas.	
14,316,Sep 4 2007 	The Best Spot in Vegas!	Great place to stay in Vegas! I was down there over Labor Day weekend and was able to relax and enjoy the sun. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to relax and at the same time be close to the strip to have some fun.

18,316,Jun 1 2007 	In Vegas doesn't feel like Vegas	The hotel is a part of a new hotel development on the otherside of Highway 15. There is a Courtyard
19,316,Jun 1 2007 	A great break from the Strip	Let me disclose up front that I am not a Las Vegas fan. It is not a place where I would vacation and I loathe having to go there on business. It was such a relief to find the Courtyard Las Vegas South. I knew I would be getting a solid business hotel with a clean room and bathroom
20,316,May 8 2007 	Oasis from the strip	I did a one night stay here for business. It was perfect. Even though there was a big fight the next day and the hotel was sold out the next day - they still let me do a late check out (THANKS!)they also have a FREE shutle to the airport (one way only) this was awesome! My room was very nice (double queen). I was cold and I did have some issue with the heater not staying on (once it got to the right temp - the AC would come on and I would freeze for 10 min then the heat

22,316,Oct 25 2006 	Quiet stay away from the Strip	At the last minute I had to attend training for work in Las Vegas and this hotel was one of the few that was available at a price I could pay. I'm not one for much of the stuff on the Strip and so I really appreciated the quiet suburban location that was a short drive from the airport. The staff were helpful and the hotel was very clean. I was thankful for the Trader Joe's grocery across the street and an upscale pizza place in the shopping center around the back of the hotel as good alternatives for the usual travel fare.	
23,316,Sep 18 2006 	Above Average for a Courtyard by Marriott	A nice surprise! I have stayed at all the big hotels in Vegas at one time or another and this one is a gem. Smallish but with all the services a businessperson needs. It is on the opposite side of the strip which
24,316,Apr 30 2006	Nice Rooms; Mixed Location	Stayed one night on a Saturday night on our way south on I-15.The Good:- Beautiful rooms. Great furnishings and finish
25,316,Nov 2 2005	Worst Experience Of Our Las Vegas Vacation	We booked our reservation the first week of September with our credit card and confirmation number
26,316,May 5 2005	Great hotel hard to believe its a Courtyard	its located across the interstate highway (I15) from the Mandalay
27,316,Nov 8 2004	Good but not great	Good but not great. New very nice comfortable hotal hotel but not a great location. Stayed here one night (Saturday Oct 30
28,316,Oct 20 2004	Excellent!	I just had the pleasure of spending one night at this beautiful new Courtyard in Las Vegas. The check-in was more than pleasant and quick. When we entered our room
29,316,Nov 28 2008	Agréable hôtel		
30,316,Apr 24 2008 	Sehr elegantes und schönes Hotel !		
1,321,"Quiet alternative to the hustle 	We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit which was clean and comfortable. Beds were comfortable and the staff was very nice. The fact that it is a nonsmoking property wasvery attractive to us since it's hard to escape the smokers in the actual casino.The property is close enough to walk to MGM although we had a car, we walked mostdays to the strip."
2,321,"Excellent accomodations and friendly service	Convenient location, close to major attractions, and in the heart of downtown. Everything you need for a comfortable stay."
3,321,"Nov 26 2009 	Exceptional Service	Great place to stay! We enjoyed the option of having the continential b'fast, the central location worked really well and the staff were very pleasant and quick to accommodate."
4,321,Nov 26 2009 	great place to stay with kids	It was like having our own apt. in Vegas. We will stay again!!!
5,321,Nov 25 2009 	Best kept secret in Vegas	If you're looking for a great place to stay in Vegas near but not in a Casino resort this is the place. We enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning. Loved having a living room and kitchen to just hang out with friends before venturing out to the Strip. Great value for the money. We would recommend this resort and would definately come back
6,321,"Nov 25 2009 	Great Property Easy Access to the STRIP!!	This resort was very clean, lovely accommodations, the rooms were furnished with everything you needed. It is only half a block from the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino and the STRIP! It's walking distance to everything. Very friendly staff, a wonderful concierge that knew about all the discounts and where the best shows were at. I would definitely go and stay here again, and again!!!!"
7,321,"Nov 25 2009 	An Oasis Just Off The Strip	Very nice one bedroom apartment room that was super comfortable and well equipped. Very quiet also even though the airport is almost next door - never head a noise with the windows/slider shut. Easy walk to the MGM, Mandalay. After staying on the strip in each of our previous stays to Vegas, we really liked the comfort, roominess and peacefulness of Desert Rose, and will make this our preferred Vegas location going forward. The only recommendation we would make is to make the continental breakfast a bit more consistent and attractive, but then there is Coco's just down the street! Great wi-fi."
8,321,Nov 25 2009 	Perfect small hotel close to the strip with large suites and attentive staff.	Excellent value hotel located off the strip. We stayed in a lovely one-bedroom suite with well-equiped small kitchen. Staff were always helpful. The continental breakfast buffet was nice.
9,321,"Nov 23 2009 	It's like having your own vacation home in Vegas	I have stayed at the most of the major hotels on the strip, but I really enjoyed my stay at the Desert Rose. Everyone makes you feel at home, and you don't have to go through a maze to get to your room at night. The rates are affordable and the layout is condo style so you have plenty of space and privacy."
10,321,"Nov 22 2009 	Great Find great price quality and service for a great price	Excellent place to stay one block off the strip in Las vegas. Well appointed, very clean rooms. Staff was very courteous and went out of their way to answer questions and offer assistance. I travel to Las Vegas 6 times a year for business and this place is a real find. No noisey slots, no crowds to bump through to get to your room, Very user friendly place with the MGM Grand and the monorail one block away. Free parking, free continential breakfast and free internet. You get the equivalent of a one or two bed room apartment with a full kitchen. This place is a real find in Las Vegas. I will be back!"
11,321,"Nov 21 2009 	Revisit to The Desert Rose	My second visit here in 2 years and I've upped my rating. Not perhaps the most luxurious accommodation in Las Vegas, but best value for money and totally adequate. I had requested an upper floor room in block 3 which was allocated and available on arrival at 15:00. As ever the room was spotless and clean. Unfortunately the room was situated over a noisy air conditioning unit which as I am a light sleeper woke me up a few times. The next day I requested a change of rooms which was granted without quibble. In fact I was allowed to look at a couple of rooms before I made my choice. I then switched to a quieter room, top marks to the staff for allowing this.The breakfast is much as I remembered- adequate. The evening cocktail 2 hours (free beer and wine) has unfortunately been reduced to 4 days per week (Mon to Thurs) and they no longer have the organ player, but you can't complain really. Free internet Wi-fi is a plus.I would recommend this place to anyone unless you're looking for a party casino atmosphere!"
12,321,"Nov 20 2009 	fantastic place to stayclose to strip	Stayed here for a week and really enjoyed our time here, the resort is clean and the rooms were both spotless and comfortable.The staff are friendly and helpful, the breakfast was o.k to start the day off with and the cocktail hour at night was a welcome addition.The security was also very good at the hotel we felt very safe.Good location, only about 10 min walk over to MGM Grand."
13,321,"Nov 19 2009 	Desert Rose is an oasis.	We stayed here for a weekend getaway. I have to say this was the nicest experience we have had staying in a Shell Vacations property yet. The staff was friendly and accomodating. The rooms (suites) are a nice size, with a small but full kitchen, and quite comfortable. The bathrooms were nice with a large tub, but the showers left something to be desired. Everything in our suite worked fine. When the maid failed to leave us enough towels, a quick call to the front desk took care of the problem almost immediately. Security is good, which is important being just off the south end of the strip. There is almost no overhead lighting in the suites, though, which makes them a bit dark at night. The breakfast buffet was continental but okay, and kept us going until lunch. The surprising decent Hooters casino is right next door.  The monorail station in the MGM Grand is a short walk, as is the tram at Excalibur. On the way back, it is easy to get turned around in the MGM Grand parking garage though. I would gladly stay here again and reccomend the Desert Rose to anyone except young people who want a place to party. Vegas is full of other places for you. The Desert Rose was a nice quiet retreat at the end of a busy day (and night)."
14,321,"Nov 18 2009 	10 out of 10 for Desert Rose	What a beauty is all I can say about this place. If and when I go back to Vegas I would not hesitate staying again. It wan clean and comfortable, extremely affordable and only one block back from 'the strip'. It was great to be able to have some peace and quiet at the end of te day, and that's exactly what we got."
15,321,"Nov 17 2009 	Good Price Good Value	A warm and friendly Hotel with very helpful and informative Staff. Away from the glitz of the Strip but Hooters, Mandalay Bay,Tropicana, MGM and Excalibur all fairly close. The apartment was very well equipped and furnished and comfortable and quiet.Having a balcony with table and chairs was a bonus ."
16,321,Nov 13 2009 	Great value	Great place to stay. Easy walk to the Strip. Quiet and clean. Condo had lots of room for everyone. My only complaint would be the lighting in the condo. Very dark and no overhead lights. I would stay here again.
17,321,Nov 13 2009 	GREAT FIND GREAT LOCATION	Brill hotel just behind Hooters and opposite Luxor. So perfect location to get to all the big hotels. Great Buffet Breakfast included in price. Great size rooms we had one bed apartment fo myself husband and teenage son. Just left the double bed setee up all day No prob. Dinning table and kitchen. Take a tray then you can carry your breakfast up to your room in the morning as seating can be hard to get. Pool area nice although wish mades would not choose to bang and clang cleaning round it just as you nodding off about 11. am.Reception staff adorable and so helpful. Would deff stay there again. Especially as food in vegas expensive. so breakfast a real help
18,321,"Nov 11 2009 	We've found our spot to stay when in Vegas!	My mom and I recently stayed at the Desert Rose while attending the PBR World Finals. In previous years we've stayed on the strip but opted for something quieter this time around. The Desert Rose was the perfect place to stay. It was comfortable, spacious, and very clean. We took advantage of having the full-size refrigerator, microwave and dishes which definitely cut down on our overall meal expenses. It was conveniently located close to the strip but was still quiet and gave that homey feeling. We will definitely stay here again."
19,321,"Nov 10 2009 	Very enjoyable stay at Desert Rose Resort	This is a brilliant hotel offering great value for money. OK, it's not as glitzy as some of the others in Vegas but it's clean, quiet, very comfortable and in a great location - just a ten minute walk to the MGM Grand and the monorail station. We stayed in a one bedroomed suite. It was very well equipped with a kitchen, a lounge, one double bedroom, a vanity area and a bathroom/toilet. Our only minor disappointment was the bathroom/toilet which did seem a bit on the small side. The well equipped kitchen had all the appliances to allow you to self cater if you wanted to save some money but you need a car to get to supermarkets as there are none nearby. We appreciated the huge amount of space to spread out at the end of a long day - much more than you'd get in an average hotel room. We appreciated the buffet breakfast included in the cost of accommodation and the early evening &quot;happy hour&quot; with free drinks. There was also a very good and extremely cheap self service laundry on site. The staff were extremely friendly, efficient and helpful. A bulb went in our room and was replaced within minutes of reporting the problem. If we returned to Las Vegas we would definitely choose to stay again at the Desert Rose."
20,321,"Nov 10 2009 	An Oasis from the Madness!	I had booked this hotel based on reviews on Trip Advisor, and we were not disappointed. Although being about a 5 minute walk from the Strip, its location and low rise appearance offered a real haven from the Madness that is Las Vegas. It was a great feeling to return to the very spacious, well appointed room, and quiet room at the end of a hectic day, and not have to face into queues for check in and check out and queues for restaurants, and not to have to walk 10 miles to find the room etc. etc. If, like me, you are not a fan of large, impersonal hotels, then I would highly recommend the Desert Rose!"
21,321,"Nov 10 2009 	Great place to stay in Las Vegas	This was our 14th year to go to Vegas for the PBR finals. We were tired of mile long casinos, so we checked out the Desert Rose and decided to stay off the strip and out of casinos. This was the best decision we could have made. We parked close to our room, about 60 seconds away instead of a mile away. The rooms were comfortable and very nice. A full kitchen stocked with all appliances and dishes and pots and pans.We are coming back next year and bringing more family. We really enjoyed this place and all the staff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly."
22,321,"Nov 7 2009 	most enjoyable 	John &amp; Lorraine Sheppard from Mansfield Nottinghamshire England my wife&amp; I stayed &amp; for 14 nights, we relaxed by the pool by morning &amp; early afternoon after a wonderful complimentary breakfast,fabulously clean white towels by the pool,constant cold drinks ,spacious sun bathing area &amp; hot tub without the sound of slot machines but still within a short walking distance of typical VEGAS life &amp; access to the monorail &amp; neighbouring hotels."
23,321,"Nov 6 2009 	little gem within walking distance to strip	good base for the strip, the first room smelt of smoke, but the reception staff were very good and changed the room straight away, the breakfast was good and the managers reception that was on from 5-7 mon-thur was very welcome. would def stay here again on next visit."
24,321,"Nov 5 2009 	Wonderful peaceful place to stay in Vegas	We stayed at the Desert Rose for 6 nights in October '08 &amp; also in October '09. This resort was recommended to us by a friend, &amp; is located within a 10 minutes. walk from the strip. Beautiful condo, very well maintained &amp; very clean. All appliances are also very clean. Nice quiet retreat after spending time on the Strip. In addition to all the amenities, they also provide a free complete breakfast every morning. Excellent location; 10 minutes drive from the airport. The pool is heated &amp; has a very well maintained BBQ area. All the staff members are very friendly &amp; very helpful. We highly recommend &amp; we will go back again. Ginette &amp; Michel from Calgary."
25,321,"Nov 5 2009 	Comfy modern safe cost effective - close to the strip but like an island resort.	We have stayed at the Desert Rose Resort and have always enjoyed our stay. The free continental breakfast is fine although the bagel boy at breakfast is a little bossy ('only one bagel on the toaster tray please' - a sign would help). The hotel is just a block from the south end of the strip so you can walk (MGM, Luxor). We always rent a car because you can park close to your room and park anywhere in Vegas - it's all free. Security is around at all times and there is a safe in each room for extra cash and passports. We have stayed at Circus Circus (yuk), The Stratosphere (bit to far on the north end of the strip) and The Bellagio (what can I say but perfection). Still we prefer our little Desert Rose Resort - a wonderful break away from the lights, noise and craziness that is Vegas."
26,321,"Nov 4 2009 	Our second visit was better than the first!	My husband and I spent 5 days here in Oct, and had a wonderful , relaxing holiday in Las Vegas. Our room was top notch and the bedding was very comfy. From check in to check out we had no complaints. We stayed here last year with our 6 yr old daughter and had a great time, and had an even better experience this time on our own. I really enjoyed the evening reception as last year having our daughter with us, I only drank pop, this year I enjoyed a few beers poolside or in the hot tub. With all the hustle and bustle Vegas has to offer, its nice to have a quiet place to return to at the end of the day. This is a great resort for families, since there is no casino. The pool is nice and clean, and the hot tub was just what we needed for some relaxation. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Vegas, with or without our daughter....and highly recommend it to anyone!"
27,321,"Nov 2 2009 	Heaven in Sin City!	We have a reunion every year gathering from coast-to-coast in Canada. Me and my cousin, the vivacious young adventurers, and my mother and her two sisters, all over 80. It's the perfect getaway. The sisters would get up and enjoy the complimentary breakfast every morning and meet guests from all over the world. The pool is a relaxing oasis where we would meet every day to make plans for shopping, shows, site-seeing, and of course our endless Scrabble tournaments. Mom and I would would then say good night to the gals and go gambling until 3am every night. Together we span 3 generations and it was perfect for all of us. See you next year."
28,321,"Nov 2 2009 	Loved this hotel	I just returned from an almost annual Las Vegas trip. I found the Desert Rose last year, after I had already booked a different hotel. I saw the reviews here on Trip Advisor, and was really looking forward to our stay here. It was great! The room was extremely clean, and well-kept. We only had one very small issue, and that was communicating with housekeeping. As seems to be usual in Las Vegas, most of the housekeeping staff is non-English speaking. Even though they say &quot;OK&quot; they really haven't understood you. I would recommend calling housekeeping, to resolve issues.The pool is great... check-in was delayed only a little, as they were full the night before and thus we waited until the official check-in time of 4:00 until the room was ready. Since this hotel gets such great ratings, I would imagine it is always full, and so you should plan to get there around 4:00.The pool was excellent. It was clean, well-kept also, and there were chairs and towels easily available.The continental breakfast was a lovely addition. Offerings were constantly re-filled, and varied a bit from day to day. I imagine almost everyone would enjoy this.I have one very strong recommendation... we were assigned to room 2217, and told it had a great view of the pool. This was true, however, if you wish to sleep in the evening, or after 6:00 in the morning, REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM!! The speakers for the pool are right under the master bedroom &amp; blast music until 11:00 at night. If this is not an issue for you, then go ahead. Also, there are loud conversations from the gym, between housekeepers, and pool guys, and people preparing the breakfast, starting at 6:00am. If you hate earplugs, REQUEST A DIFFERENT ROOM!We will DEFINITELY stay here again, however, we will be sure to request a different room."
29,321,Oct 30 2009 	Fantastic Hotel. Would stay there again.	We arrived after a very long flight from Barbados. Everyone was very helpful. Always happy and pleasant. The room was very comfortable and clean. It was like home away from home with a full kitchen. Large stove and fridge and dish washer. Nicely laid out plan. Excellent contiental breakfast. Felt very safe at Desert Rose. Excellent Location. Walking distance to the Strip. Fifteen minutes drive to Boulevard Mall. Would stay there again for sure.
30,321,"Oct 28 2009 	Ideal location very comfortable excellent value	Thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay. Hotel environment was pleasantly quiet but very close to all that the Strip has to offer. Spotlessly clean, staff helpful, continental breakfast perfectly adequate. Very comfortable accommodation at a competitive price."
31,321,"Oct 28 2009 	This place is a treasure.	We read and trusted previous reviews and booked a 4 night stay. Since we drove from Texas, it was hard to predict when we would arrive. We actually arrived in Las Vegas a day earlier than our reservation. The Desert Rose people were able to give us our room early and only charged half the regular rate for that night!! This place did not disappoint. The room was lovely and well appointed. Everything was immaculate. It is easy walking distance from MGM where we ate breakfast at Studio 24 and dinner at Rainforest Cafe.The Desert Rose is quiet and comfortable. There are no long waits for elevators that you have at the large hotels. The hot tub is great. Over all you can't ask for better. P.S. We came for the AARP convention and are 70 &amp; 73 years old."
32,321,"Oct 28 2009 	Pleasant Stay Roomy Rooms	We enjoyed our stay at the Desert Rose. The suites were roomy at over 600 square feet and very affordable for all you receive. A full kitchen was included with full-size fridge, stove, coffee maker, blender, microwave, and all cookware and utensils. TVs (older CRTs) were in both the living room and bedroom, and a DVD player with stereo system in the living room. Furnishings were very modern and attractive. The rooms were very clean, though showing their age a bit from the battered baseboard moldings. Internet access was free, though a bit slow @ 268 kbps. The big hotels charge you daily for any Wi-Fi use. Continental breakfast was free daily in the lounge, though the only hot items were toast and instant oatmeal with hot water. Only two toasters were available (one with the controls secured with duct-tape), so you had to wait a bit when it was busy. I would recommend they add an additional toaster, at least.The staff was very nice, attentive, and helpful. The convenience store was open 24/7, a nice touch, though grossly overpriced. A free USA Today paper was included though youll need to be sure to grab one in the morning as they will be gone by noon.The Desert Rose is conveniently located immediately behind the Hooters Hotel and Casino, which is across the street from the MGM and its monorail terminal."
33,321,Oct 27 2009 	Great Place	We checked in late and were upgraded to a 2 bedroom. Rooms were large and very comfortable. Nice large soaking tub for a long day of flying. We will always stay here when in Las Vegas.
34,321,"Oct 27 2009 	Did not disappoint	We chose this hotel based on the reviews it received on Trip Advisor and were not at all disappointed. My husband and I along with another couple shared a two bedroom, two bath suite. It was perfect! It made making plans much easier and maximized the time we were able to spend together since we live in different states. My husband and I arrived first and got there at 1:00. We were able to check in if we were willing to accept a handicapped accessible room. That was fine with us since we were prepared to have to wait until 4:00 to check in. About 10 minutes after we checked in we received a call from the front desk to make sure our room was satisfactory. Our friends were able to get their own room keys by just giving their names to the front desk. The walk to the strip was an easy walk and it was very near the city bus stop (we took the bus to Sam Boyd stadium for the U2 concert) and near a monorail stop as well. Even though the resort was located close to the airport, we were not kept awake by the planes leaving and taking off. We were worried about that because my husband is a light sleeper. The breakfast was light, but adequate. They had toast, danishes, cereal and either fruit or yogurt to offer. There was also coffee, soft drink and juice. The room was a little crowded, but we were able to find a seat and there was adequate seating outside or we had the option to take the food back to our rooms. There is a small convenience store located near the front desk which came in handy after a long night out on the town. We did wish we could have purchased beer there, however. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our stay at the Desert Rose and will definitely stay there again!"
35,321,"Oct 26 2009 	Fantastic Rooms - Close to the strip	We stayed at the Desert Rose for 3 nights. The room was excellent, more like an apartment then a room. Breakfast was ok, we only managed it one morning as they stopped serving at 9am, which is rather early when you are partying in Vegas!! We didn't want to be disturbed by the maid, so we put our SSH we are sleeping sign on, everyday they cleaned and tidied our room when we went out in the afternoon, which to be honest we didn't really expect! We took advantage of the Managers drinks and the free internet in reception. All in all an excellent place. Would definately stay here again."
36,321,"Oct 25 2009 	Just OK	We stayed at Desert Rose for a week in September. We had 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite. First, we had to switch the room because it was located at the ground floor by the entrance gate. Metal door kept banging all hight long. The other room was much better with different layout. The swimming pool is sad, very small. Kids swimming pool was occupied by old ladies. I was getting &quot;oh! kids! in vegas! in the pool while I'm here&quot; kind of looks. Breakfast is a joke. Disgusting coffee (proudly served by Starbucks name), toast, apples. I asked for a cream cheese but they said they give cream cheese only with bagels and bagels were not on the menu that morning. Next time we are in Vegas we will not choose this hotel. There are much better resorts."
37,321,"Oct 25 2009 	A gem!	Spent 9 nights at the Desert Rose in late October. Weather was very good (a few degrees higher than seasonal norm - mid 80's most days).Flight - Arrived mid afternoon after the direct Virgin flight from Gatwick and room was waiting for us. The flight is great as it's direct but the downside of this is that everyone is going to Vegas so a) it's full so don't expect any spare seats and b) some of the passengers took too much advantage of the free drink so it felt a bit like a rowdy all-inclusive resort. Also the seat pitch in economy is poor - much worse than other airlines to the US and Carribean.Rooms - The rooms are in three storey blocks around the swimming pool and are fantastic. Plenty of space and loads of cupboard / storage space. We had a one bedroom apartment which has a lounge /kitchen diner and then a large bedroom with bathroom. Both rooms have a Phillips TV which have loads of US news and sports channels but also HBO and TNT so you can always find a film to watch. The kitchen is extremely well equipped with everything your kitchen at home - holiday places in the UK could certainly learn a lot (i,.e. salt and pepper / washing up liquid supplied) so you don't need to buy any of that when you arrive. Some takeaway/delivery leaflets were also supplied which we used once and was very good. The bed was very comfortable. Pool - The pool got quite busy and on certain days it was a rush to get a bed - again you get the usual inconsiderate ones who bag the bed then go off for the morning - but to the resort's credit the manager came round and removed the towels! The water was not to bad - OK once you got in. The jaccuzzi was very good and very warm. Breakfast - an added bonus was the continental breakfast and free coffee throughout the day. Basic but you don't really need a full breakfast with the ginormous portions you get when you go out to eat!Manager's drinks - this was a nice addition from 5-7 pm Mon-Thurs (not sure why they don't do it at the weekend - perhaps they were worried about all the people from the Virgin flight drinking them out of house and home!). Beer and wine - but good quality. Most people gave a dollar per round as a tip. It was a good way for a lot of people to meet others staying at the resort.Location - as most people have said the resort is a block from the Strip so takes a about 10 mins to walk. You can also go in the back of the MGM (valet and check in) which is handy for the monorail. The only downside is that unless you have a car there are not any decent grocery stores nearby. There are a couple of convenience stores so you can get drinks, snacks etc but no fresh meats, salads bits etc. The only one suggestion I would make to the management is to open a snack bar by the pool for lunches / drinks and they would make a fortune.Overall - a brilliant resort away from the madness of the Strip. Would definitely recommend."
38,321,"Oct 24 2009 	Great suite	The suite was extremely well outfitted and clean. We loved it. No loud slot machines in the lobby, just a quiet clean room. The morning breakfast was a nice addition. Less than 10 minute walk to the strip (MGM Grand)."
39,321,Oct 23 2009 	Fantastic quiet location but near to all the sights of Vegas	The dessert rose one bedroom says for 4 people ok for familys but not for couples as bath and toilet are in bedroom and none inthe other room . The staff upgraded us at cost and it was great in a 2 bed 2 bathroom manythanks to Niecha. The Dessert Rose is in great quite locationbut near to all Vegas hes to offer would love t o stay again .Tipsget out of Vegas and see some great places.
40,321,"Oct 22 2009 	A perfect refuge from the chaos of the Strip	We stayed at the Desert Rose for seven nights with our three kids, aged 15, 12 and 9. Our 2-bedroom suite was spacious, clean, and very quiet (even though it overlooked the pool area). Hard to believe that the MGM/Excalibur/Tropicana/New York corner was only 5 minutes walk away.We spent most of our days and evenings seeing Vegas on foot, and by monorail and bus, so it was blissful to return to the Desert Rose for some peace and quiet. Great value for money!Just one tip - There aren't many seats in the breakfast area, so try and get there early."
41,321,"Oct 21 2009 	Comfort and convenience -- a quiet oasis	The resort was everything it advertised. We very much enjoyed the suite, the location and the service personnel. Breakfast buffet was perfectly adequate -- it gets more crowded later in the week. The cocktail hour was also a nice benefit. We would stay here again and would certainly recommend it."
42,321,"Oct 21 2009 	Wonderful Experience	We just returned yesterday from 6 days at the DRR, our stay was perfect. We found it online and booked it after reading the reviews. The Desert Rose was not a disappointment, we had a 1 Br condo and it was roomy, impeccabley clean (as was the entire property), quiet and in a perfect location. The staff could'nt have been more accommodating or nice and we would not hesitate to stay again. The continental breakfast was great, (people who complain about it must not understand what a continental breakfast is) and the coffee was the best. Our only complaint was the rude Europeans who would push you out of the way to get to a bagel (they would also take enough food back to the rooms to hold them over for the winter) and who would go out to the pool at 8am and grab up all the lounge chairs even though they wouldn't return to the pool until hours later. That being said I would not let this negative keep me from staying there again or from recommending this resort to family or friends."
43,321,Oct 21 2009 	The best value in Las Vegas fabulous roomy suites and very modern and clean.	Desert Rose Resort is just a short walk from the strip. We stayed 10 days and will definately be back. The 2 bedroomed suite was very spacious and very clean also a kitchen where all appliances were new. There was also a free buffet breakfast thrown in but go down early as after 8.30am it tends to get very busy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It is great value and much cheaper than hotels and loads of room. I saw it first on trip advisor.
44,321,"Oct 21 2009 	Almost 5 out of 5 - Incredible value	For location and price this place cant be beaten. The suites are superb, large, comfortable, clean and with lots of nice touches. Beats many Hamptons I have stayed in into a cocked hat. Great and friendly welcome too.The only failing is the bun fight, I mean breakfast buffet. I took one look at the mass of people and stuck my fingers in my ears and walked away but then for a place this size and so popular I guess its to be expected. If and when I ever come back to LV I will head here, no question."
45,321,"Oct 19 2009 	This was a great suite!	The location was very convenient to many attractions, the room was clean and very comfortable, PLUSH bedding! Great water pressure and hot water. Hot tub was hot, not luke warm like many other places. The gym had high quality machines. The complimentary breakfast was very good, nice selection that changed each day. I was very happy with the resort."
46,321,"Oct 19 2009 	Excellent place for one night or longer	We flew into Las Vegas and were only staying one night and then taking a lengthy road trip to the Grand Canyon and envrions. Well treated by the staff and given every assistance to ensure not only our stay was pleasant but that we could quickly get on the road the next day. Very large suite and spotless. For those staying longer, the kitchen area in the suite was very well appointed. If our plans had allowed, we certainly would have returned here to end off our trip to Vegas. Close to the strip (walking) but far enough away to avoid the crowds. Excellent breakfast and a place suitable for families. A definite spot to stay when we revisit Vegas."
47,321,Oct 19 2009 	100% impressed!	Best place we have stayed in Vegas for the price! Loved the GREAT rates you can get if you book early. Hope they continue to offer reasonable rates as they grow in popularity!
48,321,"Oct 18 2009 	fantastic	We stayed here for a week and got an amazing deal on Expedia. You pretty much get an apartment per couple with an en suite bathroom, fully equipt kitchen and tv/lounge area. Breakfast is basic but good value (breakfast hall got a bit crowded) but if you fancy an all American brekkie there is an amazing diner called 'Coco's Lounge' just down the road where we went 3 times and always had great food. The apartments are in a good location off the strip, a stone's throw from the MGM Casino and it was quite nice being away from the madness for a bit. We would definitely stay here again."
49,321,"Oct 17 2009 	A place you might call home	Recently my wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Desert Rose in Las Vegas while attending a convention hosted by our local Union. Having stayed at the Desert Rose previously we were aware of the careful attention they provide to their guests. However, this stay was a special experience in the way we were accomodated. The Desert Rose recognizes their elite members in a way that certainly makes you realize that you are being cared for. From the delivery of our breakfast each morning to the extra mile taken in helping us get our business taken care of the Desert Rose is truly a home away from home. One can certainly appreciate the consideration given by these folks when you are in a place that has the frenzy and glitz that can easily add more caos than relaxation. Thank you again for a job well done. We would not hesitate to recomend this location to anyone looking for a reward in Las Vegas.The Grears"
50,321,"Oct 17 2009 	Wonderful	I went to Vegas to marry the love of my life in Oct./09, we stayed the 5th and then went to the Luxor for the rest of the week , if we had not had the rooms compted we would have stayed at the Desert Rose. Their rooms are nice and spacey like me,(ha,ha)with a great location right near the MGM Grand. They really care about the customer and if there is a problem, they take care of it right away. I had my wedding cake made from scratch and brought it to Vegas, I needed to keep it refrigerated until the 7th and they did it ! When I return to vegas I will be stay at the Desert Rose every time. If Trump or Mr. Wynn were to compt me an executive suite at any of their hotels in Vegas, I would stay at this resort for sure. THEY ROCK..........GO CHECK IT OUT.......YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
51,321,"Oct 16 2009 	Faultless accommodation in great location	We could not fault this complex. Great location just off the Strip, all the amenities you could want and great value for money, highly recommended!!!!"
52,321,"Oct 15 2009 	Convenient and Reasonable	Stayed here with my daughter, her husband and 2 young children (4 yrs &amp; 18 mos. in a 2 BR suite the night before our flight back to Atlanta. It was so nice that the hotel staff at the front desk offered to print our boarding passes for us so we didn't have to wait for an available computer or print them at the airport. Our suite was very nice and clean, except the carpet was old and stained and the sofa was stained and lumpy. They said they were in the process of updating their rooms but had not gotten to this building yet. My advise would be to ask for an updated room when making reservations. If we had been staying more than one night we would have asked to be moved to a newer suite. We liked having the car close to our room so we did not have to valet park or have to walk a long distance to a self-park garage like you have to do at the big hotels."
53,321,"Oct 15 2009 	Not as close to Strip as they say but a nice place.	This &quot;resort&quot; is not as close to the strip as they say. It is basically behind and across the street from the MGM. We got more walking in than we bagained for. We had a one bedroom suite, with the bathroom accessed through the bedroom. A nicely stocked kitchenette which we didn't really use. Maids washed the few dishes that we did use. We were there to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday. When we take our son, we'll stay in a casino on the Strip, probably Bally's or Paris. Small pool"
54,321,"Oct 14 2009 	A secret gem	This is our second stay here, 4 days last year and two weeks this time. Always a great stay, daily maid service, great team and located very conveniently to the strip without the noise. Stayed in a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms and lots of room. We are recommending this place to everyone we know and am surprised that a lot of people we spoke to on our travels had never heard of the place. It represents excellent value for money."
55,321,"Oct 14 2009 	Will definitely go back!	I stayed with my my family kid, spouse and parents around Christmas time. It was fairly full. The rooms are clean and good size. The full kitchen was ideal for us including utensils &amp; dishes. The staff is friendly and they even brought a whole new set of non-stick pans for our kitchen when we pointed out upon moving that teh ones already in there had teh non-stick coating chipepd off. The breakfast buffet is excellent. They provide a vareity of food choices. It is same but it is so worth it for no extra charge! I will be goign back again this year! Free wifi in the room too!"
56,321,"Oct 13 2009 	Yearly Girl's Trip off the Strip!!!	We picked this hotel because all 5 of us would be able to stay together. As soon as checking in we went straight to the grocery store around the block and stocked up for our 4 day stay in Vegas. We ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel and dinner on the strip. It was perfect!!! They had happy hour by the pool every night with free drinks. Not top shelf, but enough to get the night started! We had everything we needed in the hotel for the 5 of us to be comfortable including all cooking utensils! Staying off the strip was perfect! When out and about we did the &quot;Vegas thing&quot;, but when we were done it was nice to come back to peace and quiet!!! Definitely recommend this hotel!!!"
57,321,"Oct 13 2009 	A pleasure... highly recommended!	What a gem! After 3 weeks of Utah tent camping, we had a relaxing 3-night stay before flying home. The location was excellent, staff friendly, the room was clean and comfortable, kitchen a big bonus... will definitely stay here again!"
58,321,Oct 13 2009 	Good Value for the Price	We wanted a place just off the strip that you would not have to walk through a casino to get to your room. This facility fit the bill. Was a block from MGM and was in back of Hooters. Place was quiet which was amazing as it was not to far from the airport and within the flight path of the tour helicopters. Very good continental breakfast but get there before 8 am to beat the crowds. Front desk is very helpful with needing cabs and the response time for the cabs was just a few minutes. Our room was a suite (I beleive most are) and was very comfortable and had lots of space. Overall good place to stay.
59,321,"Oct 13 2009 	Fantastic	Well what can I say that others havent, what a great choice for our first visit to Vegas. From the moment we checked in, it was brilliant staff from cleaners to reception always had a smile and a genuine greeting, rooms were very comfy and spacious and kitchen had every possibe appliance you needed apart from Washer but hey theres a laundry on site if you really need it. Pool area always clean and we never went without a sun lounger in the 2 weeks we were there, saying that did get busy at weekends. Desert Rose a great place to come back to after the hustle and bustle of the strip. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the begining of the strip, less if your younger and fitter. Deuce bus takes you along the entire strip with hop on hop off 7 dollars for 24 hours. Great place if like us, you are staying for 1 or 2 weeks. although you don't pay for it there is a breakfast every morning of Cereals toast, croissants, jam, marmalade peanut butter and juices. Coffee is available all day for free which is a massive bonus as is the managers happy 2 hours Mon - Thurs where beer and wine in available at no cost yes NO Cost anyone want further info just email me. would I go back DEFINATELY !!!!!!!"
60,321,Oct 13 2009 	Bargain for what you get.	Only stayed one night here but from what I experienced no fault could be given.Rooms were massive and fully furnished and clean but make sure you request non-smoking as one room in the party did smell of stale smoke.Breakfast is included of which was your standard continental but did the job nicely.Location was a 5 minute walk to Hooters.
61,321,"Oct 12 2009 	Fabulous!	My hubby and I stayed here for 2 weeks in September and loved every minute of it! We stayed and got married in the Vention last year and as lovely and beautiful as the Venetian is...I would choose the Desert Rose again due to the value! We checked in quickly and were made up with our room: spotless, comfy and everything we could have needed for our 2 wk trip, it really was a home away from home! Breakfast was fab, best to be early as any time after 8am can get crowded but pleanty of food to go around, also Managers reception was great, free beer, wine, soft drinks &amp; snacks! The lobby has free Starbucks coffee all day! The only thing negative is there isnt enough sunbeds around the pool, if you got there any later than 8 am (which was the time it opened and you had to join a que of people!!) there was towles on every sunbed and you were stuck with a chair or sometimes nothing! The hotel is situated behind Hooters and the Tropicana, it was about a 10 min walk to the main strip but we would cross at the back entrance the the MGM (over from Hooters) and cut through the MGM lobby &amp; casino as it was nice and cool! We love Vegas so much and planning a few nights next year when we travel around California and we would choose the Desert Rose over any hotel in Vegas!"
62,321,"Oct 12 2009 	What a great place with a great location and excellent value!	This was my first stay at the Desert Rose Resort. We came for the Barrett-Jackson Collector Car Event. Very nice place to stay with all the amenities you could possibley want or need! Close to the Airport and the Strip with very affordable prices. Any time I'm heading to Vegas I'm staying here!Sincerely,DellHouston,Texas"
63,321,"Oct 12 2009 	The place to be!!!!	This is my 2nd time this year staying here. I love the location. Close to everything. Very family oriented. Quite, relaxing, rooms are super spacious. The staff is very nice and helpful. Excellent price!!!! Would stay again next trip to VEGAS!!!! 2 Thumbs up!!!"
64,321,"Oct 11 2009 	Great location and friendly service - Hidden gem	Stayed for a week with husband and 2 friends in 2 bedroom unit. Room was clean and quiet, beds were comfortable and we had plenty of room for the 4 of us. Living/dining room is not large but Parents came for a day and we still didn't feel crowded with 6 people. All of the staff members we came in contact with from front desk to housekeeping were friendly and exceptionally helpful. Had no trouble checking in or out and no maintenance problems to report. Had a nice workout facility, a clean Pool and towels were provided, which is a plus (less to pack!). Resort is a quick walk, maybe a block, to south end of Vegas strip (MGM, Tropicana, Luxor, Excaliber, Mandalay Bay, etc.) so we hardly used our rental car other than to go to grocery store and downtown. Continental breakfast was served every day and was decent. We will definitely stay here again when we return."
65,321,"Oct 10 2009 	It was a great place to stay convenient to the strip and clean.	The hotel was clean and had a full kitchen. There was a good breakfast buffet. Plenty to pick from to start your day, you just had to be careful to get there before it was closing up, because it closed right on the minute it stated. The location was walking distance to the strip, where you could easilly catch a bus or train."
66,321,"Oct 10 2009 	great value	This was my second stay at Desert Rose, but it won't be my last. Talk about fantastic value...I found a sale on Expedia for only 90 dollars Canadian, after taxes for a two bedroom unit. The hotel provides breakfast. The place is spotless. The rooms are not overly large, but are spotless. Most of the guests appear to be time share people. You will need a car to get around as the hotel does not have a shuttle to the strip. It is just over a half mile to the strip and then you could take a bus along the strip if you wish. Or the monorail stop is just a block away if you prefer. But we found that a car was the most convenient way to get around Vegas. The staff at the hotel is amazing. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they always are smiling and saying hello. You could tell that the hotel is starting to do a bit of cost cutting as the breakfast this year did not have ham slices and boiled eggs each day the way they used to last year (only periodically now). But it is still a good filling breakfast and if you can find fault with it, then you should be staying home!!I love the idea of having a full kitchen and a living room and dining room when I travel. You can save a lot of money!!The only complaint I have ever heard about the Desert Rose is that the pool water is always cold. On this stay the weather was 105, but no one was going in the water as they said it was too cold. The loungers around the smallish pool were filled by 10 am.I would not recommend this place to you if you are hoping for a water type holiday. But if you are in Vegas to see the sights, then this is the hotel for you. It has the most comfortable beds. I'll definitely be going back there!!"
67,321,"Oct 9 2009 	Little tired but good value	The Desert Rose is a nice place no doubt. No frills but good value! Good location off the Strip, but close enought o walk to some of the main attractions. The hotel offered free breakfast but usually ran out of quite a few items way too soon. The pool was not heated, which was a pity, and the rooms were rather tired with some what stained carpets and faucets coming out of the wall in the shower. However, this is a nice place to stay anyway. Good size rooms, well-equipped kitchen, nicely decorated, spacious bathroom and up-to-date amenities on the property. Your dollar is well spent at the Desert Rose! Enjoy!"
68,321,"Oct 9 2009 	Excellent value and location and very close to the strip	This hotel is right off the strip located by Hooters and less than a block from MGM Grand. It is on the MGM Grand and Hooters side. The hotel staff were very accomodating. They let us check in hours before our check in time as we arrived earlier. They were very friendly. This hotel is a great value for what you get. We had a two bedroom suite. Each bedroom had large closets, windows, and large comfy beds. There were three tv's in the suite. The master had it's own bathroom and there was another bathroom on the other side of the suite. The room had a full kitchen and dining area. It was very clean. The hotel is not a large resort and offers no restaurant. There is a pool. It was too cool in April to use it. There is a continental breakfast each morning. It was a short walk to the MGM Grand tram system. We used that for most of our long distance traveling up and down the strip. We did not rent a car the four days we were there. I would definitely stay here if you want to be off the strip but still close. It is a nice quiet hotel without the smokey casinos. Great location. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
69,321,Oct 9 2009 	Fabulous stay at the DR - 5 Star comfort 	From check in to check out this hotel aims to please. Our small family reunion was fun and affordable. We even cooked one night and had every utensil and appliance necessary. Can't recommend this jewel highly enough.
70,321,"Oct 9 2009 	The staff at the Desert Rose does everything possible to make your stay enjoyable.	The Desert Rose Resort is a great place to stay in Las Vegas if you have children with you. You are off the strip, but close enough to walk to everything. You do not have the crowds or a casino on premises. The staff is very accomodating and helpful. The continental breakfast is good and the facility is clean."
71,321,"Oct 8 2009 	Cozy and Comfortable	I stayed at this hotel just this past May with 2 friends and my boyfriend, and it was perfect. We got a 2 bedroom suite, that had more than enough room for all of us. There were 2 full bathrooms, a sleeper couch in the living room, kitchen, dining area, balcony, and 2 decent-sized very comfortable beds in each bedroom. The only downfall to the hotel is the walk. If you have a car, it's marvelous and located like a couple blocks away from the strip, but walking is a little different because one block in Vegas is huge. So bring your running shoes! The desert rose also has a pool and a jacuzzi located inside for all the visitors to use which is nice if you just feel like relaxing during your trip. The desert rose isn't necessarily a party hotel, it's more of a family/lounging kind of place. So it wasn't that big of a deal going out with my friends at the other hotels, and walking back to the desert rose which was quiet and a nice change of pace after all the hustle and bustle of the city. I would definitely recommend the desert rose for those who don't mind the distance. Honestly, it was a lot nicer than even a room we partied in at the Mandalay Bay and three times cheaper."
72,321,"Oct 8 2009 	Exceeded my expectations. FANTASTIC hidden Las Vegas Jewel!	This property is just fantastic. Clean, well appointed, comfortable and the rooms are enormous given the average Vegas room. The strip is great., and the resorts are fantastic, but if you're looking to maximize your dollar in Vegas, the Desert Rose is the way to go. Like you, I read these raving reviews on Trip Advisor and wondered could it possibly live up. Well it actually exceeded my expectations. With the money we saved on their rates, we were able to enjoy a fabulous 4 Diamond Vegas dinner, and a trip to the Grand Canyon. And we never felt out of the way. We could easily be INSIDE the MGM Grand in 5 minutes walking. Unless I just have money to burn, I'll always stay at the Desert Rose. You won't be disappointed."
73,321,"Oct 8 2009 	Wonderful Hotel for the location and the price.	I found this place online and based my decision to stay here on the reviews it received. I was not disappointed. Upon arrival I notice how close(walking distance)it was to the strip. Checking in was quick and simple and the staff was very friendly. There were six of us in a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite and when we entered the room we were very happy. There was plenty of room for everyone to sleep and put away their belongings. The room was clean and we had a balcony that faced the parking lot which was nice too. They offered a simple breakfast in the morning which was good so you can eat a little something before going out for the day. Although we did not use the pool during the day, it appeared to get full quickly so it's a good idea to get there early to get a seat. We went to the pool on our last night in the late evening and it was pretty much empty and the family and I had a great time. I would definitely stay here again. If you are looking for a family friendly place or something that doesn't have a casino this is the place to stay."
74,321,"Oct 8 2009 	Brilliant stay at the Desert Rose Resort	We decided to stay here based on the previous reviews and given the price compared to the bigger strip hotels. The location is perfect, just 5 min from the MGM and the strip but far enough away to be very quiet at night. There is plenty of parking and we were able to get parked next to our rooms every day. The rooms are huge with separate living and sleeping areas. They are also well stocked and the housekeeping staff keep them very clean and tidy (even putting on the dishwasher for us while we were out). The only small gripe that i would have is that the pool area is quite small and there are not enough sun loungers so there tends to be a mad rush for beds in the morning. Other than that could not fault the place and would definitely be back for another stay in the future."
75,321,"Oct 8 2009 	Excellent value and location!	My family stayed at the Desert Rose Resort for one night, and it was amazing. We got the 2-bedroom suite at less than half price, so we were not expecting much from the suite. However, we were extremely surprised when we got there, and the suite was absolutely spacious and clean. We loved it and wished we had planned a few more nights in Las Vegas just to enjoy the resort. It's located just off the strip, so the lights and noise did not bother us, but we were close enough that it was within walking distance. Also, the gym was adequate for a simple workout, with a few machines, and the complimentary breakfast was very good. If we ever go back to Las Vegas, we will definitely be staying at this resort again."
76,321,"Oct 7 2009 	Convenient Location but...	The Good: location, service and value.The Bad: We rented two 2-bedrm suites and both were not very clean (dirty couches and bugs). Our rooms had thin walls. You can clearly hear a person's conversation in the hallway and also the constant humming of the ice machine at night.Perhaps our stay would have been better in a different area of the resort. I would avoid the rooms near the front parking lot."
77,321,"Oct 6 2009 	Loved it!	We had a great stay at the Desert Rose Resort, especially for the price. It was nice to have 2-bedrooms and comfortable living space; living room and kitchen. Our teenage kids loved the pool area, and the idea that they could buy snacks from the little shop anytime of the day or night. They were impressed with the comfortable 'at home' feeling. The staff was very friendly, especially the room attendants. We would look to stay here again the next time we come to Las Vegas. It was conveniently located close enough to the strip to walk to easily."
78,321,"Oct 5 2009 	Great place close to the strip but definitely isn't the Las Vegas strip!	Thank you for a nice relaxing and beautiful place to stay during our anniversary. The Desert Rose had very friendly and helpful staff, nice amenities in the room, and a comfortable atmosphere. We could be part of the Las Vegas scene when we wanted to and then could definitely be away from the scene when we wanted that. I definitely recommend this resort as a great place to stay while in the Las Vegas area."
79,321,"Oct 5 2009 	Great value for money in Las Vegas	After being turned off by the price of the famous hotels on the Strip for the week we wanted to visit, we read the reviews on Trip Advisor to find an off-strip hotel in Vegas. We're really glad we did, the Desert Rose Resort is a gem of a hotel very close to the back of the MGM Grand. Don't come here if you want your hotel to have the huge Vegas buffet breakfasts/lunches and dinners, but if you want a clean hotel, with excellent pool, good size rooms, easy access to the strip, free continental breakfast, helpful staff, no long queues to check in, and an affordable price then this is the one for you. Previous visits to Vegas I have stayed on the Strip (Luxor most recently), and while that is an experience, I will always try and stay at the Desert Rose Resort from now on."
80,321,"Oct 4 2009 	Comfortable Resort.	The rooms were well stocked with a full kitched, crockery etc., anything you'd need really. They were also air conditioned and clean and all apartments had their own balcony. The swimming pool was nice, but you don't really go to Las Vegas to have a relaxing pool-side holiday!We didn't have any problems with the complimentary breakfast, but then we were up really early (Nevada is 8 hours behind UK) so maybe it gets busier later but at 6am there were no problems. They had a &quot;manager's reception&quot; between 5-7 every week day when they gave complimentary soft drinks (that you help yourself to), snacks (which were not very nice ... but free!) &amp; beer/wine. The communal areas were functional &amp; comfortable. The housekeeping staff were really nice, helpful and friendly; the only problem I had was lack of knowledge on the part of the reception staff. We tried to rent a car through the hotel &amp; got so many conflicting stories from different reception staff that we ended up going on the Internet to get one through Expedia (which I think ended up cheaper than we would have paid, so it all worked out). The Internet access is now free in the lobby (I think you had to pay at one point), but it is really busy, so if you can take a laptop the free wifi in the rooms is really handy.Am defo going back to Las Vegas &amp; would stay in this resort again as it was near the strip, had ample parking and was a full apartment. I liked it."
81,321,"Oct 4 2009 	Great Place To Stay Just Of The Strip	We stayed four nights at the desert rose and are glad we did. Firstly check in was easy with no waiting and very helpful friendly staff. Later in our trip we noticed long check in lines at the major casinos on the strip so this was a big plus after the long drive we had just taken. The parking was easy and the room was just a short walk from our car. Well it is hard to fault the rooms here. They are very comfortable and well appointed. Nothing was dirty or worn unlike at previous hotels where we paid much more for a room. Our stay was quiet and with a great breakfast supplied every morning to start our day of it was hard to find anything to complain about. The Desert Rose is a short walk to the strip. We found it best to walk to the back of MGM Grand and through to the strip. The Desert Rose was really good value for the money, with helpful staff, clean well appointed rooms and quiet restful nights we will certainly be back again."
82,321,"Oct 3 2009 	Worthy of such a high rating	My wife and I came in with high expectations based upon Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointed. Our 1st time to Vegas and we would certainly stay here the next time. Convenient walking / driving access to the strip, very close to the airport, the free breakfast very good and the 5pm reception a wonderful touch when coming back to the hotel after a full day touring and before hitting the Strip for the evening. Rooms spacious and very clean - full suite for the price of a regular room on the Strip! Great find - thanks to the Trip Advisor website."
83,321,"Oct 1 2009 	Mixed bag	I left this hotel at the end of my 3 centre holiday feeling frustrated.The resort has the potential to be great but many little things all accumulated to leave me annoyed and in the whole dissapointed.On arrival at midnight we were told that due to a maintenance issue they never had a room for us and were told to go to the bluegreen hotel for 1 night and they would have a room available the next morning for us (very suspicious as there was a big fight across at Mgm that night so draw your own conclusions!!!!!!). This hotel was another 5 mins drive away from the strip and on arrival we had planned to dump our luggage and walk round the corner to the strip for a drink or two(this ended up costing us $12 in a taxi each way from the bluegreen hotel. The check in at bluegreen was not simple as the receptionist on the front desk said that desert rose had not made the reservation on line for us so she had to go and make it manually herself. The next day we got an awful room with balcony overlooking a tree (no sun) and a roof with extractor units and no apology from the staff at desert rose. I complained and they moved us to another room which on inspection looked ok. We later realised the balcony was infested with cockroaches and covered in bird droppings. I complained again and advised them i wanted it cleaned when we were out which was dealt with. On arrival back to the room we both lay down to sleep and then a constant vibrating noise started which we could not pinpoint, this was so bad we called reception and was met with the reponse &quot;well what do you want us to do about this in the middle of the night&quot;. I went straight to reception the next morning and they admitted that it was the air-con units on the roof above the 3rd floor and it can vibrate. Eventually we got given our final room which had no major problems until the hairdryer stopped working so we thought after calling maintenance(silly me it just tripped).After all the issues i had i thought it was time i spoke to the manager who i found to be friendly approachable and understanding which has certainly improved my opinion on the property.On the positive side the rooms were spacious and the managers complimentary bar between 5&amp;7 weekdays and the daily complimentary breakfasts were a nice touch.The 1 free internet terminal needs to have a time limit on it as most hotels now do this. Certain individuals spent way too long on it and were ignorant to the fact others needed on it. I would not stay here again unless changes are made. I do realise i was propably unlucky and i wish everyone luck with their rooms."
84,321,"Oct 1 2009 	EXCELLENT RESORT!!!!!!!	This is an absolutely fabulous place to stay in Las Vegas! It is close to the strip but removed if you don't want to be in with all the casinos, etc.! It was exceptionally clean, the staff were wonderful, and we enjoyed every minute we were there! We would HIGHLY recommend staying here!"
85,321,"Oct 1 2009 	Trip of a Lifetime	What a find that was based on tripadvisor reviews. One of the best apartments my wife &amp; i have stayed in. Spaceous clean rooms with excellent kitchen facilities, toaster,microwave (Takes a large pizza.) dishwasher 5 ring cooker &amp; a large fridge freezer. The staff are most helpful &amp; provide beer &amp; wine between 5-7Pm for tips. The breakfast again has plenty of choice &amp; you wont go away hungry. Free internet provided in the lounge with printing facilities &amp; in each room there is a RJ45 internet connection.We only have one negative which was the noise from external AC units are rather noisy in the upper floors. We moved to a middle floor room which was ok. We would use again."
86,321,Sep 30 2009 	GREAT HOTEL WITH A GREAT LOCATION	We were really surprised by the spacious and comfortable rooms. The hotel has a quiet situation and a few minutes from the strip. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. Only the lobby is a little bit to small to serve breakfast in.
87,321,"Sep 29 2009 	Excellent!	My wife and I stayed here in a recent trip to Las Vegas. As a traveling couple the room actually exceeded our needs for an overnight stay. Very roomy, clean, comfortable, TVs in the main room and bedroom, a full kitchen, and a wall-safe to leave our valuables while out. Adequate parking, elevators, and a security gate. The front desk staff were superb! There might be better values for the same amount of money (as I said, the room was more than we needed) but we would not hesitate to return."
88,321,Sep 29 2009 	Great place to stay close to the Strip. Clean and Friendly.	The hotel was clean and friendly. Very close to all the attractions of the Vegas strip. This would be a great place for Families to stay as the rooms have all you need to not have to go out and eat at the expensive restaurants. If you use the Shuttle from and to the airport they drop you off right at the door.
89,321,"Sep 29 2009 	Great Place to Stay	Like most other people, I found the Desert Rose to be a pleasant place to stay. Everything was clean, the rooms were spacious (it was nice to have a full kitchen after several weeks of dining out for every meal) and the pool was a welcome relief in the heat! It wasn't far off the strip (although I must admit, I wasn't really prepared for the sheer size of Vegas)."
90,321,"Sep 28 2009 	Loved this place!!!!!	Recently stayed at the Desert Rose with my husband and son. The staff there are very helpful and friendly and the room was amazing. Lots of room for the three of us and very comfortable and beautifully decorated. We enjoyed the pool area very much (nice to relax and get away from the strip for awhile), the free breakfast and drinks by the pool between 5 and 7 p.m. was a pleasant treat. I visit Vegas at least once a year - usually stay on the strip, but now that I've stayed at the Desert Rose and been spoiled I will definitely make this place my Vegas home when I come to visit. Thank you all at he Desert Rose for making this a very enjoyable stay. We'll be back!!!"
91,321,"Sep 28 2009 	Very comfortable and nicely decorated accomodations for a great price!	I must admit that I was a bit suspicious of the almost daily positive reviews by people with only one contribution on Tripadvisor. I seriously considered canceling my reservation, but decided to take my chances because of the pictures and virtual tours on their website. When we arrived, I thought to myself, &quot;the reviews may be fake, but they are true.&quot; After checking out, I received a thank you email from the hotel with a link to review them on Tripadvisor and it was then that I became convinced that they were for real. So here I am, one of the reviewers with one contribution that I was concerned about!We had traveled to Vegas earlier in the year and stayed at one of the big casino hotels on the strip. The purpose of our trip this month was to visit my sister. We wanted to be in a convenient location to the strip, but that wasn't the main focus of the trip and since my sister had a car, I explored some off-strip options. I was thrilled to death when I found a one bedroom condo with a pull out sofa for only $50 per night, just a couple blocks from the strip. This would allow her to stay with us on the days she had off from work. We opted not to use the pull out sofa, but instead she just crashed on the chaise lounge and found that to be pretty comfortable. Our king size bed was probably one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in. The only awkward thing was that the only bathroom was in the master suite so she would have to cut through our bedroom to use the restroom, but that wasn't really too much of a problem for us. It was still much more comfortable than a standard hotel room would've been. It was also nice to be able to check right in after a late flight and not have to wait in the long lines that are pretty much standard at the casino hotels.The condo is equipped with a small kitchen, complete with a refrigerator, range, microwave and dishwasher. We stored our leftovers in the refrigerator and purchased some snacks and a 24-pack of water for $3 instead of paying $2 for one bottle on the strip. We also took advantage of the continental breakfast in the morning. It wasn't the most elaborate breakfast, but had your basic cereal, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, milk and juice. They also brew Starbucks coffee all day. They have a cocktail reception in the evenings, but we didn't plan our schedules around that.My husband has labeled me an &quot;interior design snob&quot;. I am very picky when it comes to hotel rooms and I was very pleased with our accommodations. The units are very tastefully decorated with luxurious bed linens, granite countertops and high-end materials. As an Interior Designer, I was impressed with their choice of fabrics and finishes.The only complaint we would have is that the route we took past the Hooters Casino to get over to the MGM Grand stunk of sewer at times. We just held our breath for that part of the walk. The MGM Grand casino and the monorail is less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel. Another observation would be that the pool did seem quite small for the number of units there were. We didn't use the pool so it wasn't a problem for us, but could be an issue for some people.Overall, I was very impressed with the hotel, staff and most of all, the price. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone!"
92,321,"Sep 26 2009 	A real gem in the desert	Arrived in Vegas at Desert Rose not expecting too much as our friends had booked us the hotel and we saw that it wasn't one of the big names on the strip. We were pleasantly surprised to find a great place located just off the strip and opposite MGM. We were even more surprised to see our room or should I say suite. It was great with 2 bedrooms, fitted kitchen, lounge and an outstanding on suite power shower in the master bedroom. The hotel was just what we needed. No casinos to walk through in order to get to reception, but close enough to the strip for anything we wanted to do. Our teenage kids loved the pool area and the breakfast. One small gripe the breakfast area wasn't really big enough for the morning onslaught. All in all a fantastic place to stay when in Vegas"
93,321,"Sep 24 2009 	Excellent Experience	My experience at the Desert Rose Resort in Las Vegas Nv. was just awsome. The staff was great, the information they had on me was accurate. They were very helpful on the locations of bus lines, restaurants, and casinos nearby. The hotel was very clean and new looking. The room was spotless and very luxurious. The room was equipped with a kitchen including dinner ware, glasses, and silverware. Dishwasher, coffee pot microwave, fridge, and toaster. They serve a nice continental breakfast and a nice happy hour from 5 to 7 pm.. Large clean swiming pool and laundry vacilities are there to use. i was very impressed and went back three days later and had a another nice stay."
94,321,"Sep 24 2009 	A very comfortable resort with some great amenities.	We needed accommodations for two couples, and our suite at the Desert Rose was just perfect to allow a very comfortable stay for both couples. We arrived Thursday and thoroughly enjoyed the &quot;happy hour.&quot; The morning brunch was just the perfect start to the day.Desert Rose's location made for easy access to the other casinos and the monorail. I also used the workout room one morning which provided and good little workout.We would definitely return to the Desert Rose Resort."
95,321,Sep 22 2009 	Better than the strip!	Employees were so friendly and worked hard. They wiped the place down like it was a cruise ship. This was our 2nd stay at a Shell Vacations Hospitality Resort and we can't wait to check them all out.
96,321,"Sep 22 2009 	OK for Family	Stayed with infant and 6 year old. Very Clean, modern. Rooms great size. Well stocked with cooking utensils, bowls, plates, etc. Free coffee and water all day. Wi-fi worked. (We have often encountered difficulties with this at other hotels) Nice for children not to have too much Casino exposure.. Downsides: too far off of strip for tired little feet. No restaurant or lounge on premises. Pool small. Housekeeping only comes once within 4 day stay, unless you pay them a fee. Arrive early for breakfast. If you come in the last hour, they may be out of some things. The biggest complaint: we waited one hour for a Van to take us to the airport - they do not regularly pass by this resort, like they do the hotels on the strip. The desk called 3 times for us without success, then just told us to take 2 cabs (which would be twice the expense). We will definitely consider this huge inconvenience next trip or rent a car. Would still recommend, but with some planning recommendations."
97,321,"Sep 21 2009 	Best little hotel in Las Vegas	Fabulous little hotel, spotlessly clean, just off the strip. Nice pool area. Price included breakfast and during the week the hotel offered free wine/beer and nibbles (about 5pm). 3 of us travelling so booked 2-bedroom suite. One bedroom with en suite, 2nd bedroom and 2nd bathroom, full kitchen and living room plus balcony. 3 TVs. Really good sized accommodation for the excellent price through Expedia. Also benefit of laundry facilities (good as we were travelling around). 2 mins to Hooters (good value meals, good sized steak with all the trimmings $9.95). 5 mins to MGM Grand, New York, New York etc. 10 mins to airport. Good discount designer mall on the edge of town (ask reception for details)."
98,321,"Sep 21 2009 	Great digs in Vegas	My wife and I stayed at the Desert Rose Resort for six nights the first week of September and could not have been happier. The rooms were clean, bright and inviting, the resort was clean and we were within walking distance of the strip, albeit a bit of a walk. My only complaint would be the pool is a bit small for the resort, lounge chairs were few."
99,321,Sep 20 2009	A wonderful alternative...	What a wonderful place to stay in Las Vegas. The Desert Rose resort is a great alternative to the giant hotels just a couple blocks away. We enjoyed the wonderfully clean and attractive suite at a great price. The beds were wonderful and the addition of a full kitchen gave us the flexability of dining in or going out. The pool was ideal for cooling off after walking the strip - and the complimentary breakfast was another plus. The staff was helpful and provided some good suggestions on where to eat. I think it is a great place for couples or familys to stay with easy walking access to all that is Las Vegas and yet a quiet retreat from the &quot;circus&quot; on the strip. I would highly recommend the Desert Rose as a great base of operations for a trip to Las Vegas or the surrounding desert and canyon sites.
100,321,"Sep 19 2009 	Excellent value for money - Great for families	Our family of five stayed three nights at the Desert Rose Resort in Las Vegas in August 2009. It is a non-gaming hotel, located just off the Strip, near MGM, Luxor, New York New York and Excalibur. It is a great homebase to explore Las Vegas for families with young children as it is so close to everything Las Vegas has to offer while at the same time it allows you to escape from crowd and relax in your spacious suite or at the pool. Breakfast was exactly what we needed to get going. This hotel had the lowest nightly rate out of eight hotels during our Southwest USA trip and offered by far the best services. If we would stay again in Las Vegas, we would not for a second consider any alternatives;"
101,321,"Sep 18 2009 	Great place to stay	We enjoyed our stay at the Desert Rose on our road trip from San Diego, Ca to home in Missouri. Check in was extremely easy with a staff at the desk that was most helpful, knowledgeable and quick. During our 2 day stay we enjoyed a tasty breakfast each morning at no charge. Morning work outs in the fitness center that was very well equipped and clean with TVs and/or a view of the pool. After working out we spent around 3 hours in the pool which was very spacious, clean and maintained. Although the resort is slightly off the strip it is in easy walking distance of several major casinos like Hooters, MGM, New York New York and many more. We enjoyed the stay, felt very safe seeing security several times, with a clean comfortable suite that had a well equipped kitchen. We plan on returning in the near furture and highly recommend the resort to all our friends.Curt &amp; Sherry Gardner"
102,321,"Sep 17 2009 	Calm lovely place.. we stoped at the palms for 3 nights and this place was warmer better on most counts but bling	has a lovely mellow vibe, warm home from home feel, I would never stop at the palms after finding this little gem, not perfect but very good."
103,321,"Sep 16 2009 	If you want a quiet safe clean place to stay stay here!!!!!!	Other reviews sum it up! I am 39, work hard, and usually go to sleep by 9pm at the latest. I was able to have a quiet and safe night sleep here. This is not a party place, thank God! The place is very clean and well kept. I will stay here every time I go back to Vegas."
104,321,"Sep 16 2009 	An oasis of calm right in Vegas	It's great to be able to easily walk to the strip and escape to the Desert Rose Resort when your senses are overloaded. I would definitely look this place up when staying in Vegas again. It's easy to drive in to and you can park near your room, it's also easy to drive to the strip or escape the city and if you're not driving it's easy to get about. It's only three floors high which we liked. The airport perimeter is at the end of the road but we didn't have a problem with noise. Our room had a side view of the pool area with a balcony and was quiet. The staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and many a smile which helps make you feel relaxed. We didn't use the pool but could see that it wasn't that big and there was a rush to bag the sun loungers every morning at 8am. The breakfast area can also get busy and crowded if you don't get up early."
105,321,"Sep 15 2009 	Great Value and Location	What a great value. Clean rooms, continential breakfast, happy hour Mon-Thurs. This is located right behind Hooters and Tropicana. It was an easy walk to the walkways to either MGM, NY NY and Excalibur. We did not leave our end of the strip for 4 days. Staff was very nice and helpful. Definitely would stay again."
106,321,"Sep 15 2009	FANTASTIC A+++	We have been lucky enough to go to Las Vegas for the last 7 years and have stayed in both strip and off strip accommodation. This is one of the best we have stayed in. The staff 10 out of 10, the 2 bed condo style apartment 10 out of 10, Location 10 out of 10. and so on. The only fault was the pool, THEY SHOULD STOP PEOPLE FROM PUTTING THE TOWELS ON THE LOUNGERS AND COMING ROUND THE POOL LATER."
107,321,"Sep 14 2009 	I don't write reviews but this place deserves one	My wife and adult children stayed here for three nights. This was a very nice place, clean, brightly painted, with large rooms. We rented a two bedroom suite and it was very nice. I was expecting something of much lower quality based on the inexpensive price we paid. Pool is open early to late, which most 'strip' hotels are not. The included continental breakfast had a lot of variety and changes each day. Pool was very clean. The grounds were well kept. Staff was very helpful from extra towels to suggestions for sightseeing.The air conditioning worked very well. Three flat-screen tv's in the unit. When we come back to Las Vegas, we will be staying here again."
108,321,"Sep 14 2009 	good find very pleased with rooms service and location	we stayed there for 4 days in a two bedroom suite and would defintately stay there again. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, clean and are to a high standard. It is located in easy walking distance from the strip and as the strip is currently being dug up it is a mass of traffic jams so this was an excellent retreat from the hustle and bustle of vegas, which meant we had a really good quiet nights sleep. The staff are friendly and we had no problems at all, i would defintaly go back and with the cost of the rooms being so reasonable we could afford to stay for the week next time"
109,321,"Sep 12 2009	ideal Location	Desert Rose Resort is located 2 blocks off of the Las Vegas Strip. We stayed in their 2 bedroom 2 bath suite, with a full kitchen. Each morning we were treated to a continental breakfast which was plenty of food. In the evenings they served wine, beer and snacks. You could walk to the MGM Grand, the Tropicana and Hooters Casinos. You were just a short 5 mile drive from the car rental return area. The location was quiet and yet you were close to all the action that Las Vegas offers. The Staff was must helpful and their repair people were top notch. Would I recommend the Desert Rose Resort, YES."
110,321,"Sep 11 2009 	For a quiet Business solo traveller- the Best	In Vegas for work (clothing buyer for a boutique), I had opted for a different place for the major part of my trip &amp; thought Id relax on my last day at the Desert Rose. I wished that I had been there the whole week instead of one day! I could have easily walked to the strip for the Deuce bus shuttle or to the locations I had to be for my work. The full kitchen could have come in handy- they have a deal with a local market to stock it &amp; I couldve saved on expen$ive meals I had on the strip! A comfy full size bath tub, separate living &amp; bedrooms &amp; cable tvs in both rooms. Quiet too &amp; a pool (that I didnt have a chance to enjoy either), as well as other amenities like free continental bfast &amp; laundry facilities. Next year its the Rose for me!"
111,321,"Sep 10 2009 	Great trip!!!	The Desert Rose Resort was great as expected. We had an one bedroom apartment. Nice design and very clean. The kitchen was very well equipped with everything you need. Appliances were very clean and in perfect condition. Location is also great, very convenient, walking distance to the strip. The resort offers breakfast in the morning. The food was good, not much variety but fresh and tasty. The pool is always clean, perfect water. Overall we had a great time at Desert Rose, we wold recommend this resort to everyone. Awesome trip! Las Vegas is Disneyland for grown ups!"
112,321,"Sep 10 2009 	Amazing hotel near the strip !	My husband and I just returned from a 5 day vacation during which we had stayed at Desert Rose (1 bed suite). Here are some of the things we loved :* The rooms were spacious, clean; bed really comfortable; kitchen and bathroom were wonderfully done with nice cabinets and granite countertops* Only place we ever heard of that had a kitchentte and offered free breakfast !* Housekeeping was excellent ! Very few places have free housekeeping everyday.* The staff was very respectful and courteous* And, of course you cannot beat the location at this price - it is only a 5 minute walk from the strip !Whenever we go to Vegas in future, we are definitely staying at the Desert Rose. Plus, we have already recommended this place to two separate friends and they are already heading there."
113,321,"Sep 10 2009 	VFM- EXCELLENT APARTMENT HOTEL	We spent 4 nights at the Desert Rose, and were impressed with the price, location, pool. rooms,breakfast &amp; basically anything the hotel throws at you. For the price you will not find better Value For Money in Vegas, it really is an excellent base on which to start your days in Vegas.just off the strip its about a half mile walk to Excalibur, MGM, &amp; New York New York Hotels We had 2 full days on the strip and a full day tour of Grand Canyon via private jet,helicopter and pontoon boat.All of which were very enjoyable.my only recommendation on the hotels/casinos. if you have teenagers or younger kids visit the larger ones during the day, as after 9pm they do fill up with loads of people many of which are a bit obnoxtious.New York Hotel was great for kids even at midnight!!!"
114,321,"Sep 9 2009 	Can't wait to go back.	We were spending just one night in Las Vegas before our vacation through Utah to visit the National Parks. We were tied up in traffic on Route 15 coming from CA &amp; arrived in Vegas very late. What a room--everything was very classy. The suite was very spacious, and well designed with a TV for viewing in the bedroom, as well as one in the sitting area. Everything was available that one would need for a long term stay- a full size refrigerator, stove, coffeepot, cookware/silverware, ironing board, full size dining table, clothes basket, safe, extra blankets, pillows-all the extras were there. We did not have time to enjoy the pool or the other amenities at the resort, but did enjoy the breakfast. We were quite impressed. The next time we visit Vegas--we will definitely book at this resort--and stay awhile!!!"
115,321,"Sep 8 2009 	Great Getaway	Maximum bang for the buck --- the two bedroom unit was perfect for our family of five. The kids had their own space, their own bathroom, which was excellent. The kitchen was FULLY equipped. The staff, hospitable and friendly. Housekeeping was so accommodating and very, very courteous and friendly. My husband and I appreciated the Manager's Reception, while the kids swam in the pool. A mere block away from the strip, it was an easy walk to New York New York, GameWorks, Excalibur and the rest of the strip. If you're looking for a family friendly place to stay, with some distance from the strip, with privacy, and an all inclusive resort, this is the place to stay!"
116,321,"Sep 8 2009 	Unexpected	We couldn't believe the size of the rooms when we first walked through the door and then we noticed how wonderfully clean everything was, right down to the bottom of the shower curtain!( We women notice all the small details ) The hotel was mentioned as a springboard for the main reason of our trip but we will stay there every time we're in Vegas. Close to the strip without the expense, noise and business of the strip. And to be able to cook.... and added bonus again we weren't expecting. The service we received was extremely helpful and polite and caring. Thank you to all the people that made our trip an absolute delight!!!! We will recommend highly your hotel to everyone going to Las Vegas!!"
117,321,"Sep 6 2009 	Great value near the strip	Stayed here with our young children for two nights. What we liked:- The suites were really like two bedroom/two bathroom flats; very well equipped with all amenities, allowed us to cut the long series of restaurant-eating in our trip and have dinner in the room. Very comfortable bedding and bathrooms. - Great value - by far the cheapest of all our hotels over a 3 week californian trip;- Close to the strip whilst not being in the middle of the whirl (which we hated, but that's really a matter of taste); walking distance if you can stand the heat!- Staff was, with some variations, generally pretty helpful.- Breakfast overall good qualityWhat I did not feel great about was the pool, as water looked too cloudy for my taste after a long hot day (needless to say the kids loved it regardless); of course the pools is also dwarfed in size by the giant ones of the main casino/hotels. But again a good choice if you want to be close to the action whilst not being in the bigger hotel &quot;factories&quot;."
118,321,"Sep 4 2009 	Desert Rose Excellent Place to Stay in Vegas	We stayed at this resort -- found it through the RCI timeshare network -- for the first time in Aug. 2009. Loved that resort is small (vs. the huge casino hotels), clean and people were very friendly and helpful."
119,321,"Sep 3 2009 	Best kept secret in Las Vegas!	Off the beaten path, but easily accessible to the well worn Strip. Excellent value for money. Was perfect for what we wanted... golfing, Hooters, golfing, casinos, golfing. I'm not sure if giving a great review for this little gem will compromise the best kept secret in town!"
120,321,"Sep 2 2009 	Brill -made our stay an oasis away from the mega big hotels on the strip	Just returned from a 10 day stay at this fab resort, with hubby, nephew &amp; his wife who was celebrating a special birthday.Rooms were very clean &amp; comfortable, and had everything you would need.for any length of stay. Beds/ pillows were so comfortable, much needed after all the sight seeing that Vegas has to offer.Air conditioning was very welcome, couldnt do without itContinental breakfast was a great start to your day, we didn't make the managers special, but other guests were impressed with what was on offer, and remember its free.Can get a bit busy, but didn't find this a problem as everything was replenished as and when needed.Front desk staff always very friendly, every time we asked for directions staff gave us a print out, which helped. Check in/out was fast, staff always had a smile and were welcomingPool area adequate, you need your key card to get in- some times this didn't work, but other guests kind enough to let you in.Like others have mentioned, some extra loungers would have been good, just as we were leaving they were putting padded cushions out on the chairs, Clean towels are provided every day for the pool area, so no need to carry your own.Hot tub magic after a long dayThis hotel is close to Hooters hotel, approx 5-7 mins walk from strip- weather was so hot- felt like a hot hair dryer blasting in your face - be prepared take a cardi for going into hotels/ buffets as air conditioning is cool. We had a car, and it is perfectly placed to get on to the main roads, avoiding the strip.Did a trip to the canyon, booked with Maverick, Amazing- so glad we did thisAll in all, if you want somewhere clean- comfortable and friendly where you won't need your sat nav to get to the pool area or main desk, choose the Dessert Rose"
121,321,"Sep 2 2009 	Great Community Spirit in the City of Sin	Five years ago, on our first trip to Vegas, we stayed at the Sahara Hotel; a pleasant enough stay with comfortable beds, simple bathroom and nice view of the strip. The Monorail made it less challenging to get to the heart of the action in the relentless heat, or there was the option of walking via Stardust, Frontier and other Casino-Hotels that offered air-conditioning to help alleviate the pain that the oppressive sun brought upon us. The hotel was anonymous enough: we were able to sit by the pool or amble through the casino without being bothered by anyone, nor did we have too much difficulty finding somewhere to eat within our budget (God bless the Sahara buffet and the 3/4 lb hot dog from down the street, next to a useful Subway with its foot long sandwiches). We thought it was a great place to stay... until we stayed in the Desert Rose Resort this August!At first, having looked on Google Earth and having read some of the more negative reviews on here, we were sceptical: the hotel was near Hooters, near the Airport, off-Strip and small. We wondered just how safe the area was, were there going to be cockroaches in the bathroom, was breakfast as hazardous as some people claimed, was there going to be a noise issue; all manner of thoughts.Then we read through the good reviews: we saw that it was ranked as the number 4 hotel in Vegas; saw how many people loved the spirit of the place; the size of the rooms and facilities on offer; the manager's reception and the fact that you did at least get a breakfast!Providing you are up early enough, breakfast is a dream: bagels, bread/toast, cereals, fruits, preserves, muffins/danishes, cheeses (a nice cheddary one and a flavoursome white cheese with jalapenos in it), fruit salad or peaches were all readily available accompanied by a great selection of teas, coffees, fruit juices (we were particularly taken with the fresh orange juice and the cranberry punch) and two varieties of milk (2 percent and skimmed). The later you arrive to breakfast, the more waiting around there is but still the food is available and frequently topped up. True, some people have little idea as to what constitutes a line and will tend to push in, although we put this down to the fact that there could be a confusion as to whether there is one line for the cereals, meat/cheeses and toaster, or whether there were three separate ones. It didn't happen too often and most people understood the system well. There is even the option of taking food back and enjoying breakfast in your room; something we happily did on occasion. The manager's reception was also good: beer, wine, soft drinks, tea and coffee were offered along with either nachos and pretzels, or canopes of raw vegetables with a cheese sauce and a selction of mixed nuts. It was on for two hours and while perhaps not being something you would rush back for, it was pleasant enough to have if you were there at the time.Having read through other reviews, we were pretty sure of what to expect with our room but nothing could actually prepare us for the truth: they were excellent! The kitchen was very well stocked: large fridge-freezer; dishwasher; huge oven; oversized microwave; a &quot;Mr Coffee&quot; perculator (along with accompanying Wolfgang Puck coffee); a blender/processor; toaster; vast array of cutlery and crockery and enough workspace to prepare a great meal. The sink was the size of a bath which proved useful for the washing up that we did (we're not dishwasher people!).The dining table was of a very good size and was the lounge with corner unit sofa and t.v. Ok, the television could be a little more modern but it was very large and provided a good picture on the odd occasion that we sat down and watched it (usually channel 18 for the weather forecast, or the local Fox news). We never had casue to fold the sofa out into a bed although we heard that it was very confortable!The balcony was another excellent option. In a city that's prone to not letting people open their windows for fear of suicides, it was a true delight to be able to sit out and enjoy a glass of wine and the views. We were lucky: being in suite 4305, we had the pool on one side of us and the Luxor/Mandalay Bay hotels on the other. There are some cracking views to be had from many rooms although some did suffer from being inside, and facing inwards. Usually it wouldn't bother us, but we were there for two weeks so really wanted something a little bit special; we weren't disappointed! Also, being on the third floor wasn't a problem for us: some have said that the noise of the air-conditioning on the roof kept them awake - we had our air-conditioning running in the room so external noises didn't really affect us. Furthermore, the air-conditioning units on the roof run at a constant rate so the noise lessens the more you are exposed to it (rather than stop-start noises).The bedroom was good too: a huge bed, another television and a walk in wardrobe were all exceptional. I'm not sure quite how cold it gets in Vegas, but we ended up taking off the many layers of quilting and blankets that are an option for those that need it. Also, give yourself a few minutes every night to prepare the bed as someone there has an obsession with pillows and cushions! The vanity units and bathroom were simple but effective and included a hairdryer which proved useful to my partner as our European electricity powered hairdryer only runs at half power in the United States. Speaking of electricity, I'm not sure quite how the American system is but there seemed to be a lot of plug sockets and switches near to water hazards. Mains lighting with a switch in the bathroom? Sockets by the sink? I'm sure it meets up with legislation, although it took a bit of getting used to (and very precautious hand drying!). In the rooms, you'll also find: an iron and ironing board; broom and mop and an electronic safe. We were told that some rooms had a DVD in them too, although ours didn't. All-in-all, an excellent room with great facilities.Further around the resort, you'll find very friendly staff; it could just be the American way but everyone had time for you and seemed pleased to be of service. We did tip our room maid, although this lead to us having an abundance of towels in the room - by the end of the holiday we had amassed a small mountain of towels in the vanity area!The pool was an ok size. True, it's not like the pools of the mega-resorts but it was enough: three distinct areas of depth within the pool, plus two smaller jacuzzi/warm pools. Well, one pool was warm, the other was hotter than Vegas itself. However, and this is a big plus for the resort, the pool remained open until 11pm. Obviously, being Vegas, it was still warm, but there was none of the overbearing sunshine so the pool is often still occupied after the sun goes down; a very welcome offering for those with children or for those who don't really enjoy being seen swimming in daylight! Around the pool area, you have the option of using two barbeques and hotel towels. There also seemed to be enough loungers, chairs and tables (with parasols) for those that want to stay by the pool.The resort also offers a fitness centre and free wi-fi. The fitness centre has a few treadmills, a cross-trainer and a weights machine, although this wasn't working while we were there. The wi-fi proved useful but, should you not have the capabilities of using it, the hotel offers an internet connection in the foyer, at a charge. The ATM (cash machine) in the foyer charges $3 per transaction but this was the cheapest that we'd found anywhere. In fact, we'd ventured out to a bank and that still charged the same amount.Apparently, there is also a concierge at the hotel although we never saw them in the 2 weeks that we were there. However, this may be due to the fact that we left the hotel around 10am every day and didn't return until the evening - there is a lot to see and do in Vegas!!! So, bearing all this in mind, we heartily recommend this hotel. The community spirit that was spoken of in the title stems from the fact that everyone will talk with you. Whether you're in the pool, at breakfast or in the lift, anywhere in the hotel, there is a feeling that you're all in on a little secret; that you're part of a little family. Yes, the family swells at the weekend and changes fairly frequently, but the spirit of the place remains the same.TIPS: I'm sure that you're probably very aware of the things to do in Town, but there are a couple of hidden gems that shouldn't be overlooked:If you're staying for any length of time, get yourself out to Wal-Mart and stock up of ingredients. We planned on eating a meal in every other day to try and reduce costs and calories, and it offered a good bit of respite from all the hustle and bustle. The best way to do this is to walk over to Tropicana and catch the Deuce bus somewhere, paying for the all day, $7 pass. By doing this, you can use any of the buses in Vegas and can head East on Tropicana Avenue to the Wal-Mart (around 15mins on bus depending upon traffic).The car-park behind the Desert Rose/Hooters seemed safe to us: it's patrolled by security on bikes and is well lit. Cutting across it saves a fair bit of time and effort!Don't be afraid of going into Hooters: from what we saw of the casinos on the strip and downtown, the Hooters' staff are fairly respectably dressed. On Friday and Saturday night it does get a little more testosterone fuelled, but nothing too much to worry about. Also, by joining their Players' Club, you get $100 worth of free slot play for promotional machines and then a further $5 for any slot. We walked away with $15 from it; maybe not much to some but great for us! The other good Club for us (we don't gamble enough for the big places) was Circus Circus which offers $15 in casino chips.After 5pm, head over to The Hotel at Mandalay Bay and take the lift up to Mix. It's a nightclub/restaurant that offers amazing views down the strip from the 64th floor...and for free before 10pm. The lift is amazing in itself as it's external and glass - great views of Mandalay Bay and the airport and you ascend. While you're there, take time to go to the toilets too for another of life's experiences!If you forget your camera battery or need something electronic, make your way down to Fry's at Town Square. My camera battery wasn't working and I was looking at $49 on the strip; went down to Fry's and the same battery cost me $12. If you do it while having a Deuce ticket, it will save you a fair bit!Pick up the free booklets (such as 24/7 or Vegas 2 Go) as they have useful discounts: we particularly enjoyed the 2-for-1's at Hagen Dazs and Ben and Jerry's!!! However, for an amazing ice-cream experience, head over to Cold Stone in the Excalibur food court).For cheap fast food, try Jack-in-the-Box or, for something truly special, try FatBurger!!!!!And that's it. The Desert Rose Resort proved to be an excellent choice for us: great facilities, easy walking distance to the strip, good views, great value for money but, above all else, a feeling that you were part of a friendly family and not just another anonymous holiday maker in an oversized, corporate run hotel."
122,321,"Sep 1 2009 	Just Perfect for Vegas	Stayed here for one night when visiting vegas last month. It is only one block off-strip and was just right for our needs. We are a family of 5 - 3 kids (15,13,10) traveling with another family with similar aged kids. What a great place!! No slot-machines. Superb rooms - we had a 2-bed Suite which was HUGE, comfortable, well stocked. All for just about $100 for the night. Friends had a 1-Bed Suite for around $75 and were equally impressed.Great staff at the Desk"
123,321,"Aug 31 2009 	Great place	Great place to stay just a short walk from the main attractions on the strip. We stopped for three nights and were impressed with the size of the room... actually more like an appartment with seperate bedroom, large(ish) bathroom, kitchen in main living room. Better than a self catering appartment in Greece.Complementry continental brekfast was good, if a little crowded if you left it too late.Things to do in Vegas..... check out the weird 'sky' in the Venitian and don't miss the fountains at the Bellagio"
124,321,"Aug 30 2009 	Superb hotel in great location	Stayed here for 4 nights. It is just off the strip, about 7-8 minutes walk to MGM Grand so nice and quiet but close enough to be amongst everything quickly. The apartment we had was top class, service was superb, and everyone was so friendly. The pool was excellent and the breakfast was really good, although a bit crowded at times. Free drinks and nibbles every night between 5 - 7 pm (only did it once as out most of the time). This was overall a very good place to stay and value for money."
