2,226,"Nov 20 2009 	Basic accomodation free parking great location.	My boyfriend and I stayed here last may when we came up to visit our friend in the Navy. It wasnt bad. It was clean and located right in the city (which is excellent for us, as we walk everywhere). It was alittle over priced, but the location was unbeatable and they offered (free!) ample parking. Theres a mcdonalds right next door, an onsite dinner/coffee house, and a great supermarket just around the corner. I'd reccomend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a basic, no frills, place to pass the night."
3,226,"Oct 11 2009 	Smack dab in the middle of it all!	Not fancy, no frills...just what we needed to be frugal on a room where we spent barely a wink. (Who spends time in your room in Chicago?) Everywhere we went we walked; everywhere was within 15 mins.Desk staff was helpful when asking questions. Perfect for people on a budget, or wanting to spend money elsewhere in the city! Not to mention...FREE parking!"
4,226,"Sep 24 2009 	Great Cheap Stay!	My sister and I went to Chicago on whim on the weekend, just to get away from everyday life. We went to the Cultural Center, asked for cheap places to stay in the heart of the city, and this is one of the few options they gave us. We LOVED our stay here. It was simple, cheap, and right next to everything you would need to have fun in Chicago. There was really nothing grand about it, but it's really all you need. Gives you a place to rest your head, park your car, and not have to worry about anything but having fun, which is what we had came to do. Thanks Ohio Motel for making our stay in Chicago that much better! We will defiantly be back!"
5,226,Sep 18 2009 	noisy room and safety concerns	motel with ground and first floor only. I was on the ground floor and discovered during my stay that my bedroom windows were unlocked. As a solo female traveller this was not comforting to me neither were the two locks and a chain on my door. I slept very little due to feeling unsafe and due to what sounded like a generator /machinery which i think was just under my room. This continued all night . They were unable to move me elsewhere. I was please to leave and I would not hurry back. Cheap compared to many other hotels etc in the area. May be better for male travellers or groups
6,226,"Sep 2 2009 	Not great but not bad	We stayed here two nights and didn't sleep either. There was a lot of comings and goings round the back with blasting steroes at 2am on a Monday morning which didn't help. The windows shook and it didn't feel particuatly safe.The hotel is basic, it's clean enough but didn't have the rustic charm others seem to think it has. What it does have is location, and you can't beat it for that. Very central and cheap with the free parking an added bonus. I wouldn't go back, but if you're on a budget then this place isn't the worst you could find. It has a cafe attached and is next to the McDonalds featured in the Eagle Eye movie next door which is handy for breakfast."
7,226,"Jul 19 2009	A Basic Room at an Awesome Value and Close to downtown	I had read many reviews of this place and had mixed feelings. I booked anyway. I'm so glad I did! The room is an EXCELLENT value when compared to the other hotels. For example, the Best Western across the street was over $270.00 per night. I stayed in room 117 and it cost me with taxes 138.00. The room was very, very clean, but small and very few amenities. The room is only good for bathing, and sleeping which is all I need. I posted some images as well. The hotel is right on the corner of Ohio and N. LaSalle St. Across LaSalle, and down about 1/2 block is an enormous, two story, absolutely incredible, 2-story McDonald (where we had breakfast) and free WiFi, Blues/Jazz Music, a lounge upstairs, and amazing views. The McD's is open 24 hours which seemed to cause problems for some but the McD is so far away, across a major 4 lane street, and about 1/2 way down the block and surrounded by trees it never bothered me. You gotta visit this place even if it's just for a cup of coffee -- well worh the visit. Across the street - the photo I show is out my room window, is a restaurant/bar. Some folks on this forum complained about noise but I experienced NONE. Maybe if your from Kansas and you are used to absolute quite it might be somewhat noisy but I heard nothing and I live in wooden suburbia. Absolutely no noise at all. Check out the room images. Like I said, it's just for sleeping, but extremely clean I must say. The bed was kinda not soft, hard to explain but for me not a problem. Check out the images and feel free to contact me. Oh, if you go, about two blocks away is Gino's Deep Dish Pizza - a Chicago Original since 1966. The front desk recommended them and I'm so glad I went! Absolutely delicious and plenty of food."
8,226,"Jul 7 2009 	Vintage jem in the heart of the windy city	My husband and I stayed at the Ohio House Motel in May when we met friends in Chicago for a Cubs game and mini college reunion. In many ways you get what you pay for at the Ohio House, it's clean, and basic. The towels are somewhat scratchy, and the furnishings somewhat dated, though I prefer to think of them as vintage. Staying at the Ohio House is a little like stepping back in time to the days when families traveled down Route 66 for vacations. That said, you wont find a better deal in downtown Chicago. The parking is free, and that was a huge plus for my husband and I as parking in the city can be very expensive. The staff is very helpful, and the restaurant has an amazing (and cheap!) breakfast, that really hits the spot after a long night out."
9,226,"Apr 25 2009 	Cheapest I could find in the city. Free parking and good location.	Good enough for what I needed. I didn't want anything fancy and overpriced. Stayed 7 nights with no problems. Not the greatest but it was fine, and I never saw any bugs. The people on the streets and car horns can get annoying though."
10,226,"Feb 23 2009 	Exactly what you need if you're staying downtown	We had tickets to House of Blues one night and instead of paying too much for something we really didn't need we found this place. Honestly if you're staying directly downtown Chi-town what do you really need besides a bed and free parking. Room was in good shape, pretty much just a bed and dresser. Bathroom apparently was clean enough because one of the friends we went with got drunk and passed out while bathing.All in all good little find, everything downtown is in walking distance.Make sure you go walk downtown late at night and watch rats the size of dogs play in the street."
11,226,"Feb 13 2009 	location location location!	basic budget hotel in a fantastic location for access to bars, cafes, shops, etc. large rooms and friendly staff and a bargain if you don't mind not having the lil extras like coffee makers, shampoo etc."
12,226,Dec 23 2008 	Bug!!	Good location. Room is small. You gotta pay for internet access. The worst is i got bitten by bed bugs!!! Will never go back again!
13,226,"Dec 1 2008 	Flea Bag motel	Oh geez, where do I begin ? The only good thing I can say is Great location. This place was the worst in every other way. First off the furnishings are literally garbage . The table lamp in our room had black electrical tape wrapped around the center . The box springs have springs protruding and stains all over them.Some kind of red stain on the carpet,the wallpaper is coming off the wall. If that wasnt bad enough the people in the room next door were animals and fought and screamed all night untill 3 in the morning.Of course I wasnt going to sleep anyway,the bed was ready for the junk heap . I expected this place to be clean and maybe a little dated from the reviews I had read BUT ITS MUCH WORSE THAN THAT . Folks its not worth the few bucks you save . Go to priceline and get a room at the Hilton for about $35.00 more. This place was a DUMP ! ! !"
14,226,"Oct 14 2008 	Great Motel in downtown Chicago	I stayed at this motel with 2 other girlfriends and we loved it. When we first pulled up we were a little nervous about it. Before we went in we called the Best Western across the street and they were $180 where the Ohio House was $120 and it didn't really look any better then the Ohio House. We ran into a few ladies just leaving their rooms and they told us to stay because the rooms were good and clean. They even let us in to look and we were happy with them. We stayed for a weekend and were so happy we stayed there. The rooms are not fancy but they were clean and I can't say enough about the location it is close to Michigan Ave only about 5 blocks a quick 5-10 minute walk and one of the train stations is over one street on Grand, very close. Other friends with us had booked on Michigan ave at the Congress and it was way down on S Michigan, a very long walk, and about $100 more. The beds were great and the shower was nice and hot. There is a sports bar across the street and it was a little loud on Friday and Saturday night around 2-3 am although only one friend was awakenend by the noise where the other two of us slept fine and didn't hear a thing. She said it wasn't all that loud and she was able to get right back to sleep. Not a big deal because you are in heart of the city so you hear horns and such anyway. Believe me when you're in the city I don't know why you'd waste lots of money paying for a room that you're only going to be in to change, shower and sleep, there's too much to see and do for hanging in a motel room. Anyway the staff was great. We couldn't ask for anything better, they were very friendly and nice. One night at 12am we couldn't get the cable to work and the older night deskman came up to get it working for us, super nice man. We were really happy with the way you enter your rooms too. There is different sections A, B, C, etc and you have to use your key to enter into the hallway then there's a downstairs with 4 rooms and an upstairs with 4 rooms so it's great cause it's really safe and the doors to your rooms are not opening to the outside like the pictures on the wewbsite look like. It's worth it to stay here because of the location and price. We are definitely staying here when we come back to Chicago."
15,226,"Oct 9 2008 	Location Cheap free parking clean enough.	Location is north of the river, great accessibility for all central parts of town. Free parking if your staying, no valet no cost, which is amazing for this location. the cheapest place we stayed. Rooms are basic and wifi costs a little extra. But the rooms are clean enough with some quaint decorative items in the room. Some would call them old, i like to see them as eccetric.if your doing Chicago on a strict budget keep this motel and number in mind. You will save money on the other hotels in central locations.Highly recommended."
16,226,"Oct 1 2008 	enjoyed my stay	I stayed at this motel for a whole week while I had some meetings at downtown. While booking the motel I was a little bit worried because it wasn't a chain-motel and some reviews reported noise. This is why I asked in advance a quite room at the second floor. When getting there I was surprised to see a very nice and clean motel, very good maintenance, a comfortable room and a renovated bathroom. The desk clerks were very professional and kind. The location was good, in a walking distance from most of the downtown attractions. The surrounding has a lot of restaurants and fast food places. To make it short- I was very content with my selection of this motel which offer a very good value for its price."
17,226,"Sep 21 2008 	A gem	What a fabulous find. We booked on the strength of the reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed.This place is a real gem for the budget price. You can't go wrong.We were in the States for 2 weeks and drove from Rochester, MN to Chic. Parking is free and that is a huge bonus in downtown Chic.Loved the location. Everything is within walking distance and there are an abundance of restaurants around. Ask the receptionist to recommend a traditional Chicago pizza place. You won't be disappointed. We were in for a shock. Portions were huge!"
18,226,Sep 17 2008 	Great Motel!	I just can recommend this place! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights and we had a great time. Nice clean room and a very clean bathroom! Just the nightclub on the otherside of the road was a bit noisy!
19,226,"Aug 19 2008 	Greatest deal	I've stayed at the Ohio House motel twice. I really love this place. It's clean, it's very no-frills, but what do you need? The location is excellent (although surrounded by sports bars, so yes, there are bound to be some yahoos).It has a delightful little wisp of a diner (10 stools and 5 booths maybe?) with excellent french toast. The people who work in the office are very very helpful.I have to say, I might have enjoyed my stay this year a little less than last year- the air conditioning this year didn't seem as magical as last year and they're redoing the rooms and getting rid of the 1960's furniture that I'll admit, I was really charmed by last year. Now it's been replaced by pine boards."
20,226,"Jun 18 2008 	Not Worth It!	We stayed at the Ohio House Motel two times. We thought we had found a reasonably priced clean motel that had free parking and was within walking distance of some nice restaurants and Michigan Avenue.This last time turned out to be filled with problems. #1. On a weekend, the bar across the street is full of drunk people who sit outside in good weather and talk loudly all night (last time I checked was 3 a.m.). It is extremely noisy.#2. The television was stuck on Spanish. After we failed to adjust it, the clerk pulled something on the back to fix it.#3. Right after we paid, the clerk immobilized our room key, so we had to go back to the desk to get our remaining items from the room.#4. BE SURE TO LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAINS AFTER YOU CHECK IN. Make sure the window is locked. Shortly after midnight, I woke with a start to see a HAND REACHING INTO THE ROOM! I screamed and the hand went away. It made me think of the Bates Motel in the movie, Psycho. I can live the rest of my life without ever wanting to repeat that experience!#5. No shampoo or amenities. Flat pillows and very thin sheets. And Clean? Look under the bed!"
21,226,"May 8 2008 	10th anniversary night!!! We'll be back again!	5/2/08Hubby and I met in the city to celebrate our 10th anniversary. We had gotten tickets to see Sweeney Todd at the Cadillac Palace Theater (fantastic, by the way!) Had dinner at the Italian Village and went to the show. We figured that we would want to relax after our evening of dinner and theater, so hubby assigned me the task of finding a place to stay. Now, we have stayed in most of the larger hotels downtown at one time or another. We both worked in the Time Life building for decades. Chicago has some lovely old and new hotels. Many now are cookie cutters of each other, but still others are standouts. The recent renewing of the loop by converting some of the old sky scrapes to boutique hotels is fantastic... but what of the old 2 lane highway variety lodging? The reliable mom and pop motel room with snappy clean sheets, postcards in the desk drawer, good water pressure, a flickering television to keep you company...and a comfy diner within walking distance that could provide you with a tasty breakfast and a cup of joe to get you on your way! Look no further than the Ohio House! Wont cost you a Kings ransom either!We had a wonderful evening and a great nights sleep! We were pleasantly suprised by the lovely little room we stayed in (I think it was 206). We will definately stay at the Ohio House again. The parking was free and secure. The desk man was very nice (we were early...no problem!). The housekeepers were very friendly and did a great job keeping the rooms clean. We were able to walk from the theater to our motel. We had a relaxing and romantic evening! By the way... all the reviewers complaining about noise must have been out on the prairie for too long! This is downtown Chicago. You know... Frank sang about it? Al Capone used to rule the streets to the dismay of the law but to the delight of the masses! What about Dillenger? Probably the only noise he regretted hearing was the &quot;BANG&quot; outside the Biograph. The Cubs haven't won anything in 100 years there! Chicago is bound to make a little noise over that, dont you think? All I am trying to say is that we were not bothered by any noise during our stay. We had the windows open all night and I didn't hear a thing. I'm not a city dweller either... I was raised on a farm and we now live in a very small and quiet town.  Thank you Ohio House!"
22,226,"Dec 8 2007 	Great Budget Accomodation in the heart of the city	We stayed at the Ohio House last weekend on a three day stay in Chicago. Being a fairly expensive city, budget accomodation was something we needed and the Ohio House provided.The Ohio House is located close to the heart of the city (a few blocks back from Michigan Avenue). The rooms are small to average size; bathrooms average hotel size, with very 60's style appearence and decor. Most people tend to assume that budget accomodation in an expensive city means hygiene problems, however the Ohio House, we found to be, was extremely clean (5 stars in that department). The Motel also has its own small coffee house where we had breakfast on one of our days there. Its was nice, but again very 1960's style which was interesting. Chicago is full of delicious resturants and cafes though - my personal recommendation is a little French style cafe 'Cosi', a block or so back from Michigan Avenue). The Ohio House is also directly across the road from a large McDonald's (not that you'd go all the way to Chicago just to eat McDonald's!)There was only one issue we had with the Ohio House and that was the noise from the streets at night. But the Ohio House is a very clean, comfortable stay for anyone wishing to take a budget holiday in Chicago - which was a beautiful city. Personally, I would stay there again if I was looking for budget accomodation - but should there be available funds, I would probably choose to stay in one of the larger hotels in the City."
23,226,"Nov 17 2007 	Perfect for what we needed!	Ohio House Motel is an inexpensive oasis in the middle of an expensive city. We wanted to stay in the middle of the city, close enough to walk to major attractions, restaurants and bars. Ohio House was perfect for that! Several eateries in the immediate vicinity of Ohio House were great. I sit here drooling over memories of eating Chicago's deep dish pizza as we speak!! Mag mile was an easy 10 minute walk, and we found that we had no problems getting around on foot. The furthest we had to walk was to Soldier Stadium, around 40 minutes away. The accomodation was basic, but clean. it is what it is - a decent motel smack bang in the middle of a big city. House keeping did a really good job each day, and we would look forward to a comfortable bed after a long day exploring a really nice city. We stayed for 7 days, and the only thing I would have liked to have had access to for that period of time was a small refridgerator. Air conditioning worked well, showers were always hot, and for people with a car needing to stay in the city, it is perfect with a parking lot in front of the property. Motel staff were always nice and helpful enough, without being overly friendly or personal. We stayed at this hotel from the 29th June - 7th July 2007, and were able to go to the Taste of Chicago, and experience the 3rd,4th, and 5th of July fireworks. What a great time to visit!A couple of small notes - The rooms are right next to a major street, with an all night mcdonalds next door, and a night club across the road. It didnt really bother us, we had no problems sleeping, but for very light sleepers it may be an issue. People used to large hotels in cities where your room is far from the entrance to the building and any passersby, may not appreciate people being able to walk right by your room on the street.Though with two security locked doors between us and the outside, we never felt unsafe or uneasy at any time.Also, check out the large sports store ( Sports Authority) next door to the motel. With a great bargain basement, and seven stories of sporting goods, my boyfriend was in heaven. I think that people from overseas will especially appreciate the huge store, as I know we dont have anything like it at home!We stayed at this hotel from the 29th June - 7th July 2007, and were able to go to the Taste of Chicago, and experience the 3rd,4th, and 5th of July fireworks. What a great time to visit!All in all I would be happy to stay here again, if we ever get the chance to visit this great city another time."
24,226,"Nov 5 2007	Great Location and cheap free parking and clean	We would definitely stay there the next time we go to Chicago!!! Yes,it's old, and outdated inside, but it is clean, and the rooms are spacious. The location is walking distance to EVERYTHING!!!! We went for the weekend to see the &quot;Jersey Boys&quot; and could even walk to the theatre. We walked to the Mag. mile, the loop, all over...and the parking is free, your car is right there, if you need something from your car, you don't need to find it in a parking garage. Only negative we had, it is noisy at night, you hear everything going on outside, but the bed was comfortable, and we did get enough sleep. Will stay there again. The hotel across the street was double the price. Try it, it's worth it, if you plan on seeing Chicago, and justwant to sleep and shower!!!!!!!"
25,226,"Oct 9 2007	Great value	What you need to bare in mind about this motel is that you are paying $100 (50) a night to stay in central Chicago. Yes, it is a basic motel but in my experience, it's clean, secure, has cable and it's 50 a night! There's a subway station about a 5 minute walk away and the world's biggest McDonalds opposite. Whatever you may think about McDonalds, at least it means taxis know exactly where you're staying! If you're on a budget like we were then it's definitely a place to stay. Try and get a room that faces into the courtyard as the back rooms can be noisy. And if you're in Chicago, take a boat tour , yes it's touristy but you'll get amazing photo opportunities!"
26,226,"Oct 2 2007 	Excellent budget accommodation	Stayed here for 5 nights in Sept 07. The room was very clean and bed really comfortable. Shower was great, but other plumbing was a bit erratic. My room faced the alleyway at the back, and the early morning garbage trucks were a bit noisy. My friend's room faced the parking lot, which was much quieter, so it might be better to request one of those rooms. The diner attached to the motel was fantastic - great breakfasts and terrific value, and the lady owner is a real sweetheart.The location could not be better, with public transport within a couple of blocks, and plenty of great bars and restaurants within walking distance. The wi-fi (which you have to pay for) was also a bit hit and miss - did not work in my room, but worked OK in my friend's. All in all, a great choice for those on a budget, who want to be close to the loop. I would stay here again."
27,226,Sep 9 2007 	Great value and super local!	I stayed at this property back in mid July for a couple nights. This trip to Chicago was a bday present to myself but I was on a super tight budget when it came to hotels. I had seen this hotel back in Feb on a previous trip and decided to check it out. Man am I glad I did cause the rates for the rooms are more then worth it. I will admit that the weekend noise from the club across the street can be much and the rooms are in need of some new furnishings but over all the room was clean bed not too bad and those were the two things that I was looking for. Public transport is only a couple blocks away as is Portillos. Next time I am in Chicago and want to stay downtown I will give the hotel another shot just for the price alone.
28,226,"Jul 19 2007 	Average Rooms Good Location	My boyfriend &amp; I stayed at this motel for 2 nights in June. We found it to be of average quality, but in a good location, close to the city centre &amp; transport. It takes about 40 minutes to get from Chicago-Miday Airport to the motel, via the l-train. There is a car park for guests, &amp; the motel is across the road from the largest McDonald's in the USA. There are many restaurants, clubs &amp; bars in the close vicinity, with the Magnificent Mile &amp; other shopping generally about a 15-minute walk away. The room was fairly spacious but had a funny smell. It was in need of rennovation really, but in general it was definitely passable as a central city motel. The shower was pretty good, with plenty of hot water. There was also HBO, I think. Don't stay here if you are looking for hotel-class accommodation - in the end you get what you pay for, but this motel was satisfactory. We stayed in a room close to the road (the motel is near a large intersection) but weren't too bothered by the traffic noise. There is wi-fi at the motel, &amp; the proprieters let us leave our luggage after check out, which was nice - both the gentlemen we met there were really helpful &amp; friendly. The neighbourhood didn't seem the safest, but it wasn't scary either.The only real downside was the delivery trucks that kept parking in the alleyway next to our room in the early hours of each morning, where they would create quite a racket - it might be better to request a room away from the streets/alleyways if you are a light sleeper. There is no breakfast served here &amp; the cafe on the corner is not really worth it (it's small, dingy &amp; greasy - not in a good way), so save your pennies &amp; venture further afield for something a lot nicer. There is a supermarket not too far away as well, if you are on a budget. And Giordano's deep dish pizza (or Pizzeria Uno, &amp; Gino's) are to die for (&amp; not far away) if you're not worried about your waistline!Overall, this hotel is a little shabby around the edges but is certainly up to scratch value-wise. Enjoy your stay!"
29,226,"Mar 22 2007 	Best price in town but expect some discomfort	I stayed at the hotel together with my girlfriend during a weekend trip to Chicago. The hotel is probably the cheapest accomendation in downtown Chicago but you have to expect some discomfort when you go there. The room and bed where okay but the windows where pretty thin (compared to the typical situation in Germany) so you hear pretty much everything what's going on outside. Our window was towards the back side of a huge department store and there where noisy fans running all night long. Besides that you hear a lot from the big crossing next to the hotel, and people in Chicago really like to use their horn. On the other side you have free parking and other hotels in downtown are 200 bucks up...Enjoy your stay,Markus"
30,226,"Oct 22 2006	Great locale and good for the price	What an amazing spot! Chicago was the last stop on a 5 week tour of the US and this motel couldn't have been better located. A little slice of history too and quite adequate for the price. Was clean, safe and central AND had free parking. We ejoyed our stay here. It's not the Ritz but you wouldn't find a better located hostel for that price. I really dont knowwhat some people here are expecting - it's a MOTEL!!!"
31,226,"Feb 17 2006	it's right in the middle of everything	The hotel itself is fairly mediocre, but itis right in the middle of everything!ESPN Cafe, Rock and Roll McDonalds,Hard Rock, Pizza Unos's are all close by.Miracle Mile and State Street are only afew blocks away. One night I got intotown late and had to stay at a realdive, the Tokyo House. YeecH! Thisplace is nowhere near that bad, has a nice little diner next door, as wellas free parking. Compare this with theBest Western across the street which istwice as expensive.Excellent for studenttravelers or others on a budget."
32,226,"Jan 23 2006	another nice stay	stayed here several times in the past and was in town this weekend (jan 21-23) before going to work in indianapolis for 5 weeks. gotta love the free parking and the close proximity to everything chicago. while it is a motel past its prime, they now have wireless internet in the room. it is loud if you get a room on the side where the main road is; ask for a room on the backside."
33,226,"Jan 8 2006	You get what you pay for	$85/night for a queen room plus free parking in an attached lot is pretty much unheard of anywhere in the city limits of Chicago. So, you have to be a little suspicious going into it. We kept our expectations low and ended up satisfied with what we got. For the price, we knew we weren't going to have lavish decor and plush linens. The rooms are spartan and no-frills, but they are clean and adequately sized. The bathrooms have small bars of soap but no other toiletries, so be prepared and bring your own. If you're a light sleeper, this may not be the place to stay. Street traffic can be heard at all hours, as well as the bass beat of the music playing at the club across the street. We brought a travel fan and it helped drown out a lot of the extraneous noise late at night.For the location and the price, the Ohio House is hard to beat. Just be realistic about your expectations and remember that you get what you pay for."
34,226,"Nov 17 2005	Weird little place with awesome staff	You'd be surprised to find a place like that downtown Chicago. It has no website and is not featured on Travelocity and the likes (as far as I know). I found it in the Lonely Planet Chicago in the budget section after failing miserably at booking any other place for the Chicago Marathon. Everything was booked 4 months in advanced, except for $400 and up luxury suites. This place still cost $89, which would buy you a decent room on a day other than the day before the Marathon (but I think prices a much lower the rest of the time).Anyway, when it says &quot;Motel&quot;, it IS a motel. Straight out of the '50s. It is not just retro-themed, it is truly retro, so if you like that sort of thing, go for it. I still am not completely sure what that gadget that reminded of an old record player/radio (it wasn't a record player) in the corner was, but artifacts like that ceased to exist at least 5 years ago. The place was really worn out, but with a remodeled bathroom. The sheets and blankets must have been on those beds for generations. It was clean, although still looked kind of sketchy, the kind of place that would be featured in the noir film. Customer service was excellent! The gentleman who helped us check in, was one of the most pleasant people I've ever met and that is the reason why I didn't hate the motel. You can't hate a place where such wonderful people work. We also needed some help the next day and the day shift woman was also great.I would recommend this motel for people on a tight budget who don't care for frills."
35,226,"Aug 19 2005	What Can You Expect	My girlfriend and I stayed here for the weekend to see a Bears game. If you want a fancy hotel then pay the money and stay at one. But if you an ok room at a cheap price, then this it. Area was nice...No problems with the locals. Within walking distance to what downtown Chicago has to offer. Our room was ok..except for the adult magazines and McDonalds garbage that was left in one of the drawers. Their was no bugs and you cant beat the free onsite parking. I would stay here again."
36,226,"Jun 26 2005	Slum motel?	90 degrees outside, 95 degrees inside! Even with the so-called air conditioner on! This room was apparently the only one available. we ended up with a room with two twin beds on wheels w/ dirty sheets. and they were both leaning inward and the head of the bed was much lower then the bottoms. We had no choice tho all other hotels were booked and it was late. We had planned a weekend stay but after one night stay we cancelled the rest of the weekend becauseI refused to stay another sleepless, excruciatingly hot night here. After the Third Cold shower to cool down I realized that We also were not supplied with any of the normal bathroom amentities (soap, shampoo, etc.)When i complained to the supposed manager about the heat of the room, he blatantly ordered an 80 something year old housekeeping woman to &quot;look into&quot; it, (........puhlease..........) and in response she looked at me and exclaimed ...... &quot; you should thank god you even have air conditioning in these rooms, some people cant afford air conditioning.&quot; I was so humiliated, I turned and just walked away in disgust.My advice...? Be afraid, be very afraid."
37,226,"Jun 12 2005	Very satisfactory great price	We stayed for four nights in May. Comfortable room, plenty of space, clean, everything worked. No problem with noise at night. Helpful and courteous staff. Would confidently recommend this to any normal tourist. Very good value ' $89 plus tax."
38,226,"May 29 2005	Perfect for (Thrifty) Night Owls	If you have a car and you want to stay downtown, the Ohio House may be the best choice. When you factor in what the other budget hotels charge for parking, the Ohio House is about the cheapest (respectable) lodging place downtown. Plus you can look out your window and actually see your vehicle in the parking lot. I don't like the idea of having my car in a public garage, out of my sight, as is the situation at the other cheap hotels. My only problem with the OH was noise. I stayed in the room above the office---the quietest in the motel---but it was still kind of noisy. Car stereos were the problem---- Ohio &amp; LaSalle is a busy intersection. (The guy who thought of putting subwoofers in car stereos ought to be doing time in prison for crimes against humanity.) The traffic didn't die down until 1:00 am. And I was there on a quiet night---the disco across the street was closed. The room was clean, by the standards of budget motels, and fairly spacious."
39,226,"Dec 3 2004	never again	After visiting Chicago for the day, we decided to spend the night. After trying to get into several other motels with no luck(no available rooms,needed a credit card)Ohio house gave us a room,a single dirty room with two beds for $130.00. Also if you plan on sleeping, don't forget your ear plugs or you will be sorry!! There is a dance club across the street that closes at 5 am. Also the constant honking of taxi cabs ALL night long was awful. However were grateful we didnt have to sleep in our car."
40,226,"Aug 26 2004	AMAZING!!!	Wow!!! You simply won't find a better deal in Chicago. For a very reasonable fare (under $100/night, even with taxes) you get a fantastic location, very safe environment, clean and reasonably sized room, and cheap food at the diner. I was able to walk to the Sears Tower from my room (granted, it was quite a stroll, but still.) and it was pretty accessible to the subway. And the parking is free! I have zero complaints about the Ohio House. None. If I end up back in Chicago it'll be the first place I call... if some chain hasn't tried to put a tower on top of it by then."
41,226,"Aug 24 2004	Great Price	While it's been some years since I've stayed at the Ohio House, I did have a great time in Chicago. I have recommended this place to several people since. The room and bathroom are a little dated, but very clean &amp; NO BUGS!!. Most people go to Chicago for all that the City has to offer, so your hotel room is really for sleeping and showering. Why spend the big dollars on a room you will only be in for maybe 6-8 hours? Not to mention the free parking, right outside your door. Give it a try you wont regret it. Dont forget to go to the Coffee Shop for breakfast."
42,226,"Jul 28 2004	Great price great location	Stayed there July 20-25 2004, place looks very retro and the little cafe looks like it is out of the 1960's. Rooms clean and spacious, cafe is cheap and standard diner. All major attractions downtown are within walking distance, and the bus to wrigley Field is 2 blocks away, hard rock Cafe 1 block, Spot of Trump's new building is 1 mile or so away. The Rock and roll McDonald's is across street but is being rebuilt and will not open until 2005. Free Trolley to Navy Pier is 2 blocks away. The area is really clean and I did not see any hustlers, hookers or drug dealers. Any other hotel in area starts at $135.00Great value, great location, I can't believe some chain has not bought this place out. Free parking a plus as some hotels in the area charge for parking in addition to the expensive room. There is no pool but the beach is about two miles away."
43,226,"Jul 6 2004	It works for me!	Granted, its more quirky than quaint; more plain than plush. But the Ohio House is a great value. The location is awesome, you can't beat the price, you can park right in front of your door, and there are usually rooms available. It may not be grand, but it is clean and I will stay there often!"
44,226,"Nov 14 2003	Super stay!	We stayed in the room above the check-in office which has one full wall of window - it was great! Very clean, bright, and comfortable. Nothing fancy-but perfect for the budgeting traveller. Free parking a bonus - and the Ohio Hose cafe had good cheap breakfasts. Will stay here anytime I go to Chicago."
45,226,"Sep 24 2003	Best location for the price	This is hands down the best location in Chicago for the price. It is the only place we stay when we go to Chicago on a budget. The rooms are basic and nothing fancy but have always been clean, especially the bathrooms. We have never been bothered by transients or prostitutes. It is a very busy corner and have always felt sazfe there. Free off-street parking is also a huge plus."
46,226,"Jul 22 2003	Can't beat the price	Straight out of the 70's. Nothing fancy, nothing extra. It was clean and we didn't see any bugs or prostitues. For the location and price, it can't be beat. :)"
47,226,Jun 24 2003	Can't Beat It...	I stayed at the Ohio House back in the '80's' and it was around $50/night so when I wanted to go 6/03 I was afraid of what the pricing would be. I paid $89/night for a busy Chicago weekend...the hotels DIRECTLY across the street and down the block were asking $125+/night. All I did was watch an hour of TV and crashed...took a shower the next morning and left. I can't see paying for a lap of luxury in the hotel when there are so many places and things to do up there! The rooms are clean and unlike Motel 6 you get your choice of shower or bath!I am going to stay at Ohio House anytime I go for more than a one day stay.
48,226,"Mar 30 2003	A Bed and a Bathroom	A very basic, no frills motel with free parking in a lot outside the motel. Very interesting variety of customers. Good &amp; fast food in adjacent coffee shop...if you can find an open seat!!"
49,226,Feb 7 2003	It's great	This is the best place to stay in Chicago for the price. The location on where it is the greatest. It is clean and where else in Chicago has free parking?!
50,226,"Nov 11 2002	Decent place for a decent price	I've stayed in the Ohio House a few times over the past few years. It's a decent place for a decent price, with free parking. It's pretty clean, and while the furniture isn't brand new, it's really close to all the good spots, and it's on the &quot;good&quot; side of them all. It's a little noisy at night, but HEY - IT'S DOWNTOWN. The blocks on the far side of the motel from Michigan Ave seem a bit dicey, but there's really no reason to go there at night, anyway. I didn't see any hookers there, but to be honest, I wasn't looking, either. If you want the Hilton, then stay at the Hilton. Just get ready to pay $140 or more a night, plus $30 for parking daily. If you want a decent price with a great location, this is a relatively good place. It also has a very convenient little b-fast place that has good (though not too health conscious) food. Enough bang for your buck for my weekend, anyway."
51,226,Sep 21 2002	Honda Hotel	What a HOLE. The service stinks and so do the rooms. I recommend sleeping in your car.
52,226,"Aug 27 2002	Ohio House	My husband and I stayed at the Ohio house while we were on our week long honeymoon. We stayed in one of the suites above the coffee shop. It was VERY clean, and had a kitchenette and everything. We were over joyed with the service, we had the most delicious breakfast everyday at the coffee shop. It's also close to most every attraction in the city. We loved the Ohio House and will stay there every year for our anniversary! P.S. We didn't see any vagrants or prostitutes either!"
53,226,"May 16 2002	At least there's no bugs	Yeah, it's not the Hyatt, but it's cheap, convenient and there always seems to be rooms here."
54,226,"Jan 18 2002	What a Dump!	Go anywhere else, unless you want to be surrounded by transients and prostitutes."
55,226,Oct 22 2009 	Sorprende

57,226,Aug 26 2007	essenziale ma in posizione eccezionale
1,231,a much needed relaxing stay!	Good hotel service starts at check-in and the front desk agents at the Red Roof are always so friendly! They made sure we had the things we needed for the night and greeted us everytime we walked past the desk. Our room was cozy and very clean. The comlimentary coffee in our room was perfect in the morning. I'll definitely stay there again soon.
2,231,Nov 24 2009 	The crew at this hotel makes your stay worthwhile - especially Ms. Robinson!	Great staff. Great location. Needs renovation but all in all a great place to stay.
3,231,Nov 23 2009 	You've got to include this hotel when you go to Chicago Downtown	Perfect location with perfect value! Walking distance to Navy Pier. Just one block away from Michigan ave.
4,231,"Oct 8 2009 	Great trip to Chicago	This was my first time in Chicago, we came for a Cubs game. After reading several negative reviews we were very hesitate about staying at this hotel but we were pleasantly surprised. We checked-in at about 4:15pm on a Thursday, it was very quick. We had a king room on the 16th floor. It had a nice flat screen tv &amp; a small desk. The elevators &amp; hallways are very small but...I didn't go to Chicago to spend time in them. The room was more then big enough for my husband &amp; I. I don't know what their double rooms are like but I could see that maybe 2 beds in a room might be a bit tight for a family of 4. However, for as little time spent in the room, I don't think it would be a big deal. If planning to be in the room for long amounts of time, I probably would spend a bit more for a nicer hotel. The elevators &amp; hallways are very small, but again...not there to spend a lot of time in the hotel. The location of this hotel can't be beat, especially for the price. Just steps from Michigan Ave &amp; Magnificent Mile shopping &amp; we were able to easily walk to about everywhere we wanted to go from the hotel. The only real negatives I have about the hotel room are this: the carpet seemed quite dingy with a big pink stain in the corner, the bathroom needed a bit of deep cleaning ie. walls around/below sink &amp; the grout in the shower needed to be scrubbed. This is a no frills place... if you're on a budget &amp; looking for a place to change clothes &amp; sleep at, this is a great value. I really can't complain about anything considering we paid only $50/ night thru Priceline...you can't beat that for the heart of Chicago.Food &amp; drinks in downtown Chicago can be pricey so I recommend the TGI Fridays that is on the other side of the block from the hotel (on Erie St.) They have a very nice bar area &amp; drink specials every day of the week. We didn't find this place until our last day &amp; wished we had much earlier. Great place to sit, watch a game &amp; have a drink after a long day of walking. We also stopped by the Signature Lounge on the 96th floor of the Hancock Bldg. for a drink. Instead of paying $12-$15/person to go to their observation deck, we went to the lounge &amp; had a drink. Drinks are pricey but you get a great drink while enjoying the great view. I recommend going during the afternoon to avoid the crowds for your best chance at a seat by the window. There is also a McDonalds &amp; a Walgreens about 4 blocks west on the same street as the hotel. Also to be checked out: Maggiano's Restaurant (great food, reasonable prices), Navy Pier for fireworks at night (Billy Goat Tavern for a drink), Second City comedy club (great show).We were really impressed as to how easy everything was to get to, either by walking or public transit. We ordered a 3-day pass from the CTA website prior to our trip. They were mailed to our house (included in price) &amp; don't activate until the first time you use them. They are good for unlimited rides on the bus &amp; el train. Use Google Maps for directions, it is connected to the transit authority &amp; will map your way for walking or public transit, giving you the correct bus # or train &amp; how to get to the correct bus stop. We used it on our Blackberry &amp; it worked great! We had one of our best trips ever &amp; the hotel was great for what we needed it for. We would stay here again &amp; I'm sure we will."
5,231,"Sep 25 2009 	Was a Good Value For the Price	On a spur of the moment I decided to go to Chicago to see Paul Potts and wanted an inexpensive place to stay. The hotel's location is ideal being only one block off Michigan. The room I had was a corner room was rather small and sparse but it was clean. For the price level you got the amenities you expected, small bar of soap, plastic wrapped plastic glass, shampoo in a package similar to ketchup pack. It was adequate and since it was just me the room was large enough. I had not read all the negative reviews of the hotel but found the staff helpful. I don't have any complaints. If you are looking for basic hotel serices at a great price (from Priceline) this is the place."
6,231,"Sep 16 2009 	lip service to roaches and bugs	My wife and I had stayed at the RRI on a previous visit, and I felt OK booking her and a friend there again. Unfortunately, her room had cockroaches, other bugs, and other cleanliness issues. A complaint brought an apology and excuses from the GM, but nothing else. A free night or a reduction in rate would certainly have been appropriate.In her note, the GM says &quot;I realize we have lost your business&quot;. How right she is."
7,231,"Sep 15 2009 	DO NOT stay here	cockroachs, black mold/mildew in bathroom, staff allow panhandlers into lobby, room is dirty even after staff cleaned; more like just replaced the towels"
8,231,"Sep 14 2009 	Great location for the budget traveller	This hotel had some dodgy recent reviews, so I was pleasantly surprised at the friendly and helpful staff. Bedrooms were a trifle small, but this room (on floor 15) seemed in good decorative order, and bathroom was bright and clean. There's a safe in the room for your valuables; hair-dryer, iron and in-room coffee-maker. It's well situated for the Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile and an easy walk to Navy Pier, the river, Water Tower, the El and shopping. Some tasty and inexpensive eateries (Burrito on the Beach) are nearby. I'd gladly stay here again."
9,231,"Sep 13 2009 	Red roof inn is very near and walkable to all chicago attractions	Red roof inn is very near and walkable to all chicago attractions,but for parking, stay in redroof inn was very cost effective."
10,231,"Aug 31 2009 	Perfect	My wife and I stayed for one night and we were very skeptical after reading the reviews; however, the hotel served us perfectly. The staff was very friendly and the location was awesome. The room was small but certainly adequate, and it was clean. The bathroom was just fine. The flat screen TV was a nice amenity and the bed was comfortable. Hey, we only paid 50/night through priceline and you can't beat that. I would stay there again in a heartbeat."
11,231,"Aug 10 2009 	You get what you pay for..Nothing!!	I decided to take a weekend trip with a friend to Chicago. After searching through many hotels, I decided upon the Red Roof Inn because of the location and the cheap price. I should have known that the cheaper the price the cheaper the service. Upon arrival the desk clerk took my credit card and ID and started the paperwork. However, she kept answering the phones, and it took nearly 15 minutes just to get our room keys. When we entered our room, the air conditioning was broken. We called the Front Desk and they said they would send a maintenance man up to fix it. After 3 more calls to the desk in an hour and a half period, she offered to switch our rooms. The other room was smaller and had a broken light. The maid didn't even clean our room the next day until after 5pm!! My parents stayed at the Best Western and only paid 20 dollars more. Next time, I'll ante up the money and stay at a place that is deserving of my business."
12,231,"Aug 8 2009 	Red Roof Inn Downtown Chicago	The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is that they do not tell you how expensive the parking is...As a first time visitor to Chicago I did not know the parking situation.When I booked a room here they never told me...they probaly assumed I knew....That parking was an extra $36 a day...I was on a budget,and that blew my budget all to hell.Beware that parking is alot extra...the hotel it's self was fine...my room was a bit small but what the heck do you expect for one of the cheapest nights stay in Chicago...It was clean and comfortable...Staff was very friendly and one valet recommended and excellnt place to eat dinner that was under $10 for the entre."
13,231,"Aug 4 2009 	Spend the extra money and stay somewhere much nicer.	I stayed at hotel June 5-7 2009, though the location of the hotel is perfect, the hotel &amp; service itself is less then that. Upon checking in I was put into a room that was dirty and had spider webs in the in the windows and was the size of a closet (yes it's a downtown property I accepted that, the cleanliness however was not acceptable) I called down to the desk to see about switching rooms and was told I was in the largest room, they didn't offer to move me until I asked for a refund to move elsewhere. I was put in a much nicer room. This seemed to be partly remodeled. The day of check-out a person who was in the room with me dropped their phone between the bed and wall, went to pick it up and found old dried up vomit on the wall, floor and side of the bed. At check out i brought it to the ladies attention and was simply asked if I would like another copy of my bill. I decided that when I got home I would call the manager. Manager was nice apologized and offered to refund my money. Long story short it has been about TWO months and due to lake of competence, and just plan disregard with the extent of this issue; I am STILL waiting for my refund. The customer service is seriously lacking, I have gone through 3 different people promising my refund, none of which have actually followed through. I would advise you spend the extra money and stay in a much cleaner hotel to avoid any situation of this matter."
14,231,"Jul 28 2009 	Perfect for Teen/College Students	This hotel is in a perfect location downtown. The cleanliness wasn't the best, but if you're going to Chicago for the city, and not for the hotel, it's definately worth it. The cleanliness mentioned in other reviews was not experienced during our stay. We had a blast in chicago, and the Red Roof Inn provided a great night's sleep for us."
15,231,"Jul 24 2009 	Ok hotel but would pay more to stay somewhere nicer next time.	We stayed with my 2 daughters (8 &amp; 12) for an overnight fun trip in Chicago. We booked on priceline &amp; got a great rate, so I suppose you get what you pay for. I had been reading others reviews on the hotel &amp; honestly was terrified on what we'd find when we arrived. I was prepared to forego my money &amp; just head home if it was as bad as others had said. I was pleased to see that our room was clean when we arrived. Although I couldnt wait to get out of there because it was so SMALL. We were all tripping over one another &amp; really felt trapped almost. The check in staff was very nice &amp; friendly, as was the valet. It is definitely a 2 star hotel, so dont expect extra perks or luxury features. However, I was at least thankful that our room was clean. Lesson learned however, it was nice to spend less, but at the end of the day, I'd just assumed have paid $25 more &amp; stayed in a better quality hotel. The location was great though-right by everything in the heart of the downtown. We probably wont return again though."
16,231,"Jul 24 2009 	Good price for the area. The service and cleanliness were not so good.	We couldn't have asked for a better location for the money. That said, I travel quite a bit with my job and the Red Roof Inn on Ontario is one of the worst hotels I have had the pleasure to stay in. When we arrived, the air conditioner in the room did not work. I called the front desk to get something done about it. The girl at the front desk assured me that it would be taken care of. It wasn't. We didn't press the issue because the weather was mild during the week we were there. The room was not altogether clean. There were dirty q-tips, a face cleaning pad, and a wad of toilet paper in our ice bucket when we arrived. They stayed with us all week. I would only recommend this hotel to someone if they are willing to sacrifice customer service and cleanliness for a cheap room in an excellent location."
17,231,"Jul 10 2009 	Phenomenal value in prime Chicago location.	I booked through Red Roof's site, some promotional rate they had. I had a hard time figuring out where in Chicago the hotels were, as I wanted to be near certain addresses. Asking a native for the name of the neighborhoods, as well as spotting some hotels, helped. The hotel on E. Ontario is a great location. Checking in was ominous!! Two young people were at the desk and the young lady did not stop her personal conversation the whole time she checked me in. She filled out a document while commenting on the pregnancy of an acquaintance, and the other clerk gossiped with her about it while I stood completely ignored. Not a query, not a question, not a how are you. How I hate this kind of reception!The bell man was very attentive. The room was oddly shaped, but large in comparison to a NYC hotel of three times the cost. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the room had a microwave and fridge. The bathroom was a comfortable size. Ironing board, adequate closet area space, large TV. Hairdryer but no fancy giveaways, but that is fine. The floor was populated by young folk from Europe. One time in the elevator, two maids were very friendly and 'real', and expressed their hope that my room was all right. That was surprising and nice. The bell man helping me out with luggage was great and I had to push a tip on him.I'd stay there again because of its location. Maybe next time I'll interrupt the clerks and ask them to pay attention to me! I was on floor 11.The information on parking was accurate and told me that in no way did I want to use their parking arrangement. I appreciate the candor &amp; made other arrangements. I tried to use the wifi and when it failed I did not have time to mess with it. I'm not sure they have it; I may have been picking up a signal from a building nearby."
18,231,"Jun 26 2009	Great area wouldn't stay here again though	I stayed with a coach group and found that the hotel was dirty and the staff rude, maybe because we were in a group they didn't seem to care. The carpet in the hallway on our level was filthy and/or stained. Our room was OK but I was too afraid to touch anything. The bathroom seemed fine. The lobby was TINY, but I guess there wasn't much else they could do with the space. The bonus coffee and flat screen telly in the foyer were nice. It was close to everything but the standoffish attitude of the staff and the stained carpets have stuck in my mind."
19,231,"Jun 25 2009 	The good news is they let us leave...	On a recent business turned leisure trip to Chicago my boyfriend and I were booked to stay at this hotel. I read the reviews and was apprehensive, but I didn't make the booking so I didn't really have a choice. It seems as though the reviews for this hotel are bipolar. My experience was definitely on the negative side. The staff seemed apathetic, the room was small and the decor depressing. I recently spent two weeks in Europe staying in budget hotels: I can put up with tiny rooms, shared bathrooms, cheerless decor, and surly staff. I cannot put up with uncleanliness. There was debris on the carpet, for instance toothpicks laying in the middle of the carpet. The bathroom floor had what I can only describe as 'crud' in the grout and around the toilet. The tub was dirty and had people's hair stuck in it. Hair was clearly visible on the floor. I was concerned that If they don't even pick clearly visible toothpicks off the floor, do they wash the sheets? My boyfriend asked that we be moved to a different room, the staff obliged, but that room was just as dissappointing. The other concerning event occurred while I was in the lobby. Several young men came into the hotel lobby and began soliciting people in the lobby - trying to give them fliers and stuff. They were rather harmless, though they did mildly sexually harass me, but they clearly had no business being there and the staff made no attempt at removing them. The only good news about this hotel is that they let us cancel everything and leave without a fuss.Fortunately, the Courtyard Marriott, located right across the street had open rooms, it cost approx. $2 more a night. The difference was night and day. (I highly recommend them - Courtyard Marriott Mag Mile - they are currently doing construction but only during business hours on weekdays.)"
20,231,"Jun 9 2009 	A very good option try it and you won't be disappointed	Dear traveler,I had a real pleasure to spend some days in this hotel. I must confess, I read the comments about this hotel only after booking it. Therefore, before getting there, I was scared to death. But, after arriving, I had a great wonderful surprise. Everything was perfect: clean room, good conditions with regard to the price, best location, very friendly staff people. As a world traveler, I had spent days at great hotels, i.e. Ritz, Four seasons, Hilton, Hyatt, Best Western, Fairmont, Sheraton etc . So, do not expect to find the luxury here. But, for the price you pay and the location, you should be very confident. Again, do not hesitate to choose this hotel and you'll be very pleased. I had no complains, on the contrary. Good luck!"
21,231,"Jun 5 2009 	Best location ever	The hotel is one block away from the Magnificent Mile and that's why we went there. Also because it's one of the cheapest in Chicago downtown! We had to wait a lot to check in because the room wasn't ready. The room wasn't very clean either. We think that the person that cleaned it was loosing her hair, because there were hairs everywhere! (yes, even in our bed). Anyway, if you're looking for a great location at a low price, you'll find it ok."
22,231,"May 25 2009 	Great location could have been cleaner.	Booked this hotel on Priceline and was somewhat concerned when we saw which hotel we won. The location relative to Michigan Avenue couldn't have been better. The room was decent sized and had a nice tv. The bathtub was dirty and didn't drain well, and the carpet was not vacuumed very well. It's fine if you're looking for a room in downtown Chicago and don't plan to spend much time at the hotel."
23,231,"May 18 2009 	felt cleaner before we showered... the streets would have been better	We traveled with students and had a block of 6 rooms. Of the 6, 3 tv remote controls did not work, 1 tv did not work, and 1 blowdryer did not work. There was a suspicious stain in one room that looked like blood. We found lettuce on the floor in one room and hair on the sheets in another room. After complaining and asking to switch rooms, no action was taken. Finally we demanded a new room and were given a corner room with a leaking seal in the toilet, leaving our floor wet the entire time. The rooms were not cleaned while we stayed there. The desk staff was incredibly polite and nice, yet unable to do anything about the status of the dirty rooms. We stayed there for the location and the price, but would not stay there again. Try the Congress Hotel or the Best Western are much better deals."
24,231,"May 12 2009 	Decent budget hotel right in the centre of downtown Chicago	We have booked 2 rooms for myslefI ,my husband and a friend for 2 nights in May. After reading the reviews and before checking- in to this hotel, we were very skeptical to the point of even canceling our reservations, but it is not as bad as the earlier reviews make it sound like. Infact it is worth more than the value we paid for the stay and the location.It is a CLEAN, decent budget hotel right in the centre of downtown Chicago. All major attractions/restaurants are of walking distance.Staff is courteous and polite.Rooms were clean (although it gives a slightly old feeling) but has a LCD TV.Towels and bathrooms were clean only problem was the shower, which was not working in our room but it was alright in my friend's room.Even temperature control was working fine.However, please note that since it is a budget hotel, there are no water bottles available within the hotel, so it is recommended you carry one with you.Overall, good value for money."
25,231,"May 10 2009 	Affordable and acceptable	After reading the other reviews on this site, I was expecting to have to barricade myself in my room while sleeping in my clothes and trying to fend off hordes of lice. In my experience, this hotel does not deserve the reviews it's received.Let me preface this by saying this is a &quot;DISCOUNT&quot; hotel. And they even call themselves that. If you want high class, go book the W. I made a weekend roadtrip into Chicago and wanted something very cheap and very central to get the most bang for my buck. Red Roof delivered.First, service. When I checked in the service was polite and to the point. They didn't chat me up, try to up-sell me, or bother me with any other trivialities. They checked me in and showed me the way to my room. Sure it's nice at the W when they ask you, &quot;What is your wish?&quot; but that comes with a price tag. The staff were helpful when I asked for directions and were not rude at all.Secondly, the room. After reading the reviews on cleanliness I gave my room a serious once over before unpacking anything. The room was a little run down as it's an older building, but there were no real cleanliness concerns. It was a little dusty under the bed with a few stains in the dark coloured carpet, but nothing I'd consider unhealthy. The sheets and towels were pristine white and clean. There were no odours or anything unpleasant as has been commented in other reviews.The room was quite small. It would be a little cramped for a couple, and I certainly wouldn't want to be sharing the room with kids. My room only had 1 bed though, so the others may be larger. For 1 person it was perfect, but I don't go on vacation to spend a lot of time in my room.The room is also equipped with a safe.My only complaints would be that there were a few broken items in the room. The window looked like someone had tried to force it open so I was able to actually remove it from its frame. I only noticed this because it was a little noisy, but being right downtown that's to be expected. The A/C also wasn't working in my room, but I didn't need it at this time of year. It wouldn't surprise me if the two were related.Third, location, location, location. It doesn't get much better than this! 1 block from the Miracle mile, a 10 minute walk to the Navy Pier, and less than 10 minutes to the John Hancock building. It's a phenomenal central location to be able to cover a lot of sites on foot.Lastly, value. I booked on priceline and got my room for $50/night! No complaints there considering the prices of other nearby hotels. Now valet parking was another $40/night but after asking around that sounds like it's pretty typical.In conclusion, as a single traveler looking for a cheap central hotel on a sightseeing vacation, I'd have no problem returning to this hotel again."
26,231,"May 7 2009 	Cramped Rooms Bad Tempature Regulation	I stayed here one night in late November 2008. The service was friendly but when we got up to the room we turned on the heater (it was in the 30s outside) and within an hour the room was still cold. We told the front desk and when we got back the room was too hot! Also, the beds seemed old and the room was tiny. This hotel takes people under 21 and is a GREAT location but the rooms were pretty bad.You have to purchase a T-mobile hot spot to get wireless."
27,231,"Apr 14 2009 	A great last minute decision.	My friend and I visited Chicago in early April to see RENT. Unfortunately, we had booked a room at the Howard Johnson that was completely horrible and was able to find this hotel with an opening at the last minute! We were so grateful that they had a room for us. Paying $36/night for parking kinda hurt but the valet takes the car for you and they were very nice and accommodating. The room was small but clean and cozy. All of the staff was very friendly. We wanted to go to the Field Museum on our last day and checked out at 12pm but they still kept our bags and car until we were done at the museum free of charge! I would definately recommend this hotel for anyone. The price for the location and value was great!"
28,231,"Apr 9 2009 	So Filthy had to shower standing on a towel	Shower floor had thick shelack of filth and grime and god knows what else. Feet sticking to floor in shower!!! Thin throw blanket only on bed along with dirty bed spread. Hard to argue with price and location, but even a one night stay was unbearable. Lastly, were instructed the valet would need 20 minutes to get car - we waited an hour, a fitting end to our stay."
29,231,"Apr 6 2009 	this place is a flea bag	I am not a very picky person and that is especially so when you only pay $130 for a room in downtown Chicago-- you don't expect it to be fabulous, but you do expect it to be clean. The room was so small we could hardly get a round the beds and the decor looked like it hadn't been updated in 20 years. None of us would walk in the room without our shoes on because the carpet was so disgusting. I would compare it to a motel off the freeway in the middle of nowhere that you would pay $29.95/night or maybe pay for by the hour . We left and went across the street to the Marriott Courtyard. They said they routinely get customers like us. I will say the location is great and the staff was very nice and they took $40 off our bill without us really griping . Pay the extra bucks for somewhere decent."
30,231,"Mar 28 2009 	Be afraid be very afraid	Traveling with two teenage kids, we paid extra for the &quot;deluxe suite.&quot; It was filthy. There were still crumbs on the floor and the bed sheets were NOT changed (there was someone else's hair in the bed already! How Gross!). The room smelled like dirty socks. The bathroom door was off the hinges. The bathroom had mold on the sink vanity. There were candy wrappers in the corners of the room. The TV remote did not work. The A/C rattled us out of the room. We ran out of this flea infested firetrap after staying one hour. We paid for -- and completely enjoyed -- the marriot courtyard direct across the street. This is the ONLY post I have ever made on this website."
31,231,"Mar 21 2009 	one step up from a homeless shelter	This has to be the sleeziest, dirtiest, most disgusting hotel I have ever encountered. No heat, no hot water, leaking toilet and sink, window didn't close all of the way, filthy carpet, dingy linens, no customer service...The front desk was no help in correcting any of the problems with the room or with moving us into another one. (I actually doubt they had another one in any better condtion to move us into.) This hotel should be condemned. It's hard to believe the health department doesn't close them down because of all the mold, filth, and leaking urine from the toilet. I can't believe they have the audacity to charge money for these rooms. They should close down while they do renovations. This hotel is in a great location and would do very well if it were not in such deplorable condition. One would think that Red Roof would see what they have with this building and at least bring it up to liveable conditions. Unless your standards are much below substandard, you would do yourself a favor by steering clear of this pit. If you don't care about cleanliness or warmth, at least make sure you are up to date on your vaccines and bring a supply of antibiotics. I would sooner stay in a homeless shelter than subject myself to this atrocity again."
32,231,"Mar 6 2009 	Disappointing	The hotel is well located, but the rooms you would hardly wish to remember: the window could not be properly shut, and there was no heating - in the month of November in this &quot;windy city&quot;. Well, It seems that for this amount of money you cannot expect anything better in Chicago downtown..."
33,231,Feb 13 2009 	Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid!!!	I stayed two nights at this so-called hotel. It was more like a housing project. The only reason that I stayed there was because I had business at Northwestern's School of Law and this hotel was very close. I'm surprised I made it out alive. The hallways are narrow and quite seedy. The elevators are slow and loud. This place may have been a grand hotel in 1920. Now it's a slum. Expect to take a shower in cold water as well. You can also expect to hear everyone's conversations because the walls are paper thin. I seriously considered barricading the door to stop some thug from breaking in and robbing or boogering me. Yikes. Stay away.
34,231,"Feb 11 2009 	good location and nothing else	Room 401. Seal on toilet on floor was leaking. Bathroom floor was constantly wet with urine/water. The entire bathroom absolutely reeked of urine from the moment we arrived. I cannot believe that a housekeeper cleaning that room would not have noticed this. Given the strength of the smell, it must have been going on for weeks or even longer. Drunks in the hall kept us up half the night. Floors were dirty. We slept in our clothes. This was a block off of Michigan Ave (this would have received a &quot;terrible&quot; rating from me otherwise), and the price was cheap -$50 on Priceline- but I would never stay here again. Spend the extra $30 and stay somewhere that doesn't turn your stomach."
35,231,"Jan 11 2009 	Penicillin may be needed after staying here.	Hotel Name: Red Roof Inn Chicago Downtown  We were excited when we walked in and saw that the lobby had been renovated. There were two lounge areas with new sofas and a big lounge table. There was a bracket for a flat panel TV but there wasnt a TV attached to it. The hotel only had one person at the desk at check in so there was a line that we had to wait in. The elevators were small as is expected in older city buildings. When we exited on our floor there was a pleasant smell from the deodorizer the housekeepers used. And the hallway was clean.  Upon entering the room, I noticed that the door was a little small, not a 36&quot; standard. Although the room next to ours was handicap excessible. The second thing I noticed was that the rooms were not updated as the lobby was. THe room looked nothing like on their website. There were a few furnished updates such as lamps and a chair, but the beds were small and low to the floor. The bed coverings were also outdated and looked worn. The sheets and pillow cases however did look new. I then looked over the room and the wall that enclosed the bathroom had a big crack down the middle and the wallpaper had started to peel away along the whole length of the crack. In the bathroom all of the grout had mold and mildew. The tile in the tub/shower surround and above the sink had been painted and was peeling. The toilet was no longer affixed to the floor, which I found out when I sat on it. And when I looked at the ceiling there was an attrocious ammount of BLACK mold all over it. The tile in the surround was also warped and regrouted maybe as if there was a ruptured water pipe. The only things that were done to make the bathroom look nice was a new mirror and light fixture.  When walking out of the bathroom I looked at the entrance/exit door and noticed that it looked as if the door had been pried open, because the entire frame of the door by the deadbolt was cracked and pulled away from the wall. My husband and I were thoroughly disgusted with this hotel."
36,231,"Jan 3 2009 	Good Price Good Location	I stayed at the Red Roof Inn from Dec. 6-9 as part of a business training in the area. We had several rooms and chose the hotel basically on price and location alone. Hotel is in a perfect location. Although we were on business, we were able to spend time enjoying ourselves because of the location - it was right off of Michigan avenue which meant many restaurants and shopping.Although inexpensive, the hotel was perfect for us. The rooms were very clean and it looked like they were beginning to update them as well. My room already had a new flat screen HD TV like I have at home (nice touch!) and a few surprises we did not know about when we booked like coffee makers in the room. One of my colleagues had what looked like a renovated room with new bedding and carpeting.The only small negative thing was the lobby was being renovated with new paint, etc., but who cares - you don't stay in the lobby!If you need an inexpensive, clean and no frills hotel choose the Red Roof Inn on Ontario."
37,231,"Nov 14 2008 	If you still stay here after reading this...	If you still stay here after reading this, you shouldn't bother with this website. I have stayed at this Red Roof several times, and it isn't great, but never as bad as this visit. Big trade show. All hotels unreasonable. Trying to save money. Big mistake!No hot water 3 of 5 mornings. Tub didn't drain 3 of 5 mornings even after I complained. Didn't clean my room or make the bed one day. No soap or shampoo most nights. No towels one night. Sink falling off the wall, toilet seat broken. Door wouldn't open a few times. Tiny room and bathroom. Plus, it was a comedy of errors on the part of the maid service. They only had two very pleasant staff members in the entire hotel one night. I don't know how they stayed so nice and polite. This is a dive and is getting worse. I wonder if they have remodeled since the 50's. The mtc. guy said they were going to remodel starting soon, but that wouldn't solve the cleaning staff problem. This is only the half of what was wrong..."
38,231,"Nov 13 2008 	Ughhhh	The most deplorable conditions I have ever encountered in a hotel anywhere. The room had a window that was jammed open, the heater didn't work, no hot water, filthy carpets, and a huge stain on the comforter that looked like blood. Had to sleep wearing a coat! The front desk said they could not move us to another room because they were fully booked. They said they would send someone up to make repairs but never did. Management says they will be starting renovations soon, but DO NOT reserve a room in this hotel unless you are guaranteed a renovated room or can see the room for yourself first."
39,231,"Nov 4 2008 	Great location	Red Roof locates just a street from the main shopping shopping stretch, near COACH, and jazz bars, short walk to Hard Rick cafe, Heaven on 7 (cajun food) and convenience stores.Room is cosy enough, warm but dont expect great amenities. Service staff friendly, recommended great places to visit...i would stay here again, oh and it's close to pizza UNO, the famous Chicago deep dish pizza..yummy"
40,231,"Oct 20 2008 	Worst hotel ever! I'm not kidding!	This hotel advertises &quot;Surprising luxury at affordable rates&quot;! This is a bold lie, there is not one bit of luxury at this hotel.Carpets are FILTHY, don't take your shoes off! One elevator broke down and the Chicago fire dept. had to rescue stuck people.Elevator stopped on every floor going up and down. This was not due to someone pressing all the buttons as this happened for 3 days straight, day and night. The front desk was notified by dozens of customers and still nothing was done.There was vomit next to one of the beds upon check-in!The hallways look like a dark cell block and the rooms are smaller and dirtier than a cell!Absolutely disgusting, please, please take my advice and stay elsewhere! I would not stay in this hotel again if it was complimentary!!!"
41,231,"Oct 13 2008 	Get what you pay for!!	I'd read the reports of this hotel so I kind of knew what to expect. It was a central city hotel, right on the corner of the 'Mag Mile', with a relatively cheap price so I wasn't expecting any kind of luxury. Carpet could do with being changed, but the bathroom was clean if a little tired looking. The room had a smell as the windows wouldn't open. The front desk staff were helpful with directions and maps - but my wake up call didn't come. Not a hotel I would recommend for a long stay but bearable for a couple of days before picking up my tour which was right outside the door."
42,231,"Oct 12 2008 	Average place in a good location	We stayed one night in the Red Roof Inn in October 2008. We booked the room online in advance. It was the least expensive option in the area and we did not have high expectations. We arrived early for check in, but were accomodated efficiently by the front desk. The main glitch was that the first room we were assigned was still occupied, but the front desk apologized and we got another room quickly. The room itself was a bit ragged. There were peeling paint on the ceiling in the bathroom and the furnishings looked a bit dirty, but we think we just worn. The beds were okay but a bit soft. The room size was very big, but oddly shaped - very long and narrow. Not a lot of amenties, but the TV worked and there were no other issues with the mechanicals of the room. The front lobby did have coffee for free, but we did not try any.The location is the main reason for staying here. It is one block from Michigan Ave and fairly close to a lot of nightlife and restaurants in the area.Overall, if you need a place to sleep and do not need any frills, this will do."
43,231,"Sep 27 2008	Disgusting	I arrived for a two night stay at this hotel on 11 September 2008 as a member of a coach tour, looking forward to a comfortable room before travelling across to Los Angeles. What did I find? Carpets in corridors were absolutely filthy, no facilities for a hot drink in rooms (only from machine in lobby between certain hours, overall decoration dirty and dingy, trouble with door lock, air conditioning very noisy, could not regulate temperature and it still made a noise even when switched off, sockets nearly off the walls, hair dryer not working, ceiling in top floor corridor leaking quite badly and to crown it all the toilet was not fixed to the floor so it moved and rocked everytime I sat on it.Apart from being near to the Magnificent Mile shops this hotel has absolutely nothing going for it. In fact my opion is that it should be closed down it is just so bad. I just wish that I had taken photographs to prove just how unsavoury this hotel is."
44,231,"Sep 17 2008 	Scary Ugly and Noisy	We stayed at the red roof inn for one night when we arrived early and the hotel we had reserved was full that night.It was a horrible experience, the rooms were small, smelled weird and the door locks were loose. It was only my sister and myself, so we used the iron board to hold the door shut. I wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel at all! Worse this was that it wasn't cheap!"
45,231,"Sep 16 2008 	Worst value in Chicago	Wow, this is the first time I've written a review just to tell how bad a hotel was. It's not so much that the hotel was a dump, it's the value of it. We paid nearly $250 for our &quot;king suite,&quot; which was really more than we had wanted to spend but it was the last minute so we just figured we'd suck it up and at least enjoy a nicer hotel than we'd typically book.No luck there.This was a drab, uncomfortable hotel. Linens, carpet, furniture, everything were bottom of the barrel and worn out on top of it. The bed was uncomfortable and the room smelled funny. The toilet clogged our first night there -- which I think it would have done even if all I'd used it for was to clip my toenails over -- and it never got fixed, luckily there was another toilet in the room because it was a suite. That one was equally weak so I used it reeeeeeeeeeeally conservatively. Should I have to count pieces of toilet paper in a $250 a night hotel?To their credit, the front desk did give me toothbrushes when I told them we forgot ours. That was the highlight of our stay.If you are forced to spend your pennies in this place at least get a room on a lower floor. We were on the 16th and, even when it made no stops, the elevator took so long to get to the darn lobby and back that I almost didn't want to run down to get a cup of coffee in the morning. I was especially irritated when I found they were out of cups."
46,231,"Sep 1 2008 	Not horrible but pretty bad	This hotel is located in a prime area downtown. So, location is good. However, after notifying guest services a few times about no air conditioning in our room to no avail, I gave up and took off the cover of the AC unit and messed around with it for about 15 minutes to get it work myself. So, the customer service, especially at night, was poor. Additionally, after paying for internet here, the only signal I got was &quot;very poor&quot; and I was unable to actually utilize the internet on my laptop. Again, customer service was of no help.Summary:Although the location is good and the price is decent, I would rather pay $20 or $30 more and stay at a nicer place downtown."
47,231,"Aug 12 2008 	The Worst Red Roof I Ever Stayed In	I booked the room on the Red Roof website, but when I arrived (even with my &quot;confirmation number&quot;) the people at the desk could not find my reservation. I still got the room at the rate I was promised, though.On the other hand, it was not a pleasant experience. The room smelled like dirty socks that had no place to air out. So, I turned on the a/c full blast as I unloaded the car from downstairs. Speaking of the downstairs loading zone, the valet parking attendant suggested that I give him my car keys so he could move my car in case the police decided to tow my car since I was parked halfway into the loading zone and halfway out. (I quickly figured out that the car that dominated the loading zone was HIS, because I saw him taking a couple of smoke breaks in it while I was dealing with the problems at the registration desk. I decided I would take my chances with the police rather than trust this guy with my keys.I had to park across the street and down a ways in the lot for another hotel. It was not easy to get to: because of the series of one-way streets I had to go around a couple of blocks to get to it even though it was a short walk from the Inn.Returning to the room, I found that the phone did not work, and several tiles were missing from the bathroom walls and floors. The hallways were dingy and the carpet unclean. The elevators were slow and small, but necessary for a 15 story building. I had to go down six floors to find an ice machine.I've stayed at many Red Roof Inns in different cities.. They tend to be &quot;cookie cutter&quot; copies: kind of boring, but at least you know what to expect. But not this one. While I would stay at another Red Roof Inn, I would avoid this one like the plague."
48,231,"Aug 8 2008 	bad experience worth the price	Located on Ontario and N.St.Clair- this hotel is a perfect spot to walk to Navy Pier, Michigan Ave shopping, and even cross the river. Our stay, however, was not good. A pipe had broke in the hotel a day earlier and it smelt like stale washclothes. In our room the sink was clogged, their was mold on the ceiling, and the table was dirty. With much effort we were switched to a different room. It is a dingy place, but for the location, it is worth the cheap price we payed."
49,231,"Aug 1 2008	Red Roof Inn in downtown Chicago	This hotel was horrible -- dirty and nasty. We only stayed 1 night and I felt like I was going to get lice or worse. The carpets are filthy in the hallways and the rooms. The hair dryer didn't work, the room was creepy and dirty. I slept fitfully and first thing in the morning found another hotel close by that for only $40 more a day was 1000 percent nicer. I will never stay in another Red Roof Inn. I doubt that the CEO of the company would let his family stay at this place. It is a shame, because it is a good location."
50,231,"Jul 6 2008	Recommend to stay elsewhere!	The only positive about this hotel is the location. It is extremely convenient not only to Michigan Ave but all the Mag. Mile area. It is 4 blocks to the Red Line (ESPN Zone, Niketown, etc.)We were on a school trip and had 40 kids with 18 rooms. We expected better, and out of 18 rooms you would think that at least more than half would be recommendable.Just about everything was a bad experience. Front desk clerks were rude and indifferent. They had no hotel safe anywhere. The two elevators were extremely old and so slow. Hallways were dark, dingy and dirty. The carpets were NASTY. Our socks were black from walking on the floors. The rooms were very small, outdated. Bathrooms were falling apart. Some of the rooms had toilets that leaked, faucets that leaked, loose tiles, clogged showerheads. It was a nightmare.There is no parking. Nothing. Nada. You're on your own.Chicago is way too big a city with too many options to choose this place."
51,231,"Jun 22 2008 	Bottom of the barrel	We stayed at the Red Roof because we were directed there by a wedding planner. One who must never have visited the site. From a distance the price seemed reasonable for the area, so we booked a room. Where to begin. The elevator: one broken, the other on its way out. The management had the really bad sense to tell the guests that the cable broke. Off the elevator (while it still worked) and on to the hallway to the room. Dingy. Dark. Carpet dirty, wrinkled and torn in places. I'm getting the creeps. And then the room: tiny, even by NY City standards. We needed to move sideways around the bed. No room for a sitting chair. Battered furniture. The thick, accumulated dust of months on non-desk and dresser surfaces (ie, the furniture was dusted, other horizontal surfaces not). There had been an attempt to renovate the bathroom. This consisted of painting over the ceramic tiles and the tub. As might be expected, said paint was cracked and peeling.After one hellacious night on the medieval rack of a bed, I grabbed my computer at 6AM and found a better deal at a lovely place -the Fairfield Inn- literally three doors down the block but a world of quality away, complete with free internet and breakfast, real shampoo in bottles, big bars of soap and free magazines about Chicago! We felt like we'd checked in at the Ritz.Overall, this Red Roof was an over-priced, depressing experience. I would advise anyone to steer clear of it. Head down Ontario St. a half a block and check into the Fairfield Inn."
52,231,"Jun 17 2008 	Horrible!	My boyfriend and I were attending a wedding taking place on Michigan Avenue the weekend of May 17th, 2008. The groom of the wedding advised us that The Red Roof Inn would be perfect since it was only a 2 blocks away from where the wedding was and it is in such a prime location (a block away from Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile). So we followed his advise b/c we thought it was such a good deal especially w/the prices there...well, you certainly get what you pay for! The service we received at the front desk was excellent. Even w/how busy they were, the 3 woman working there was on top of everything and very friendly. However, the room itself was horrible! The bathroom floor was stained brown in multiple places and it smelled like dirty feet. We tried to prop up the bathroom door to air it out but there was no where for the smell to go since the windows were bolted shut. I dont' know how to describe it, but the room was just plain dirty! I felt gross just being there. Also, I know that the information about the velet parking states that you should take all of your values out of your car, but I had no idea it was possibly b/c of the velet employees! I figured they were just concerned in the case that your car was broken into. We arrived on Friday afternoon and left on Sunday morning. The whole time we were there the car was in the hotel's parking garage. As far as we know the velet employees were the only ones in the car b/c there was no signs of a break in. We had quite a bit of luggage and when we first arrived we were unable to take EVERYTHING out of the car. So we left a bag of snacks/beverages in the backseat (we were driving from IA so we stocked up for the car ride to Chicago) and a small tin w/change in it for all the tolls. However, when we got our car back on Sunday, we had a Red Bull, $2.25 in quarters and $1 in dimes missing out of our car! I felt it odd that someone would break in and steal just these random items and not the car stereo, all of the money change or all of the food/beverages left in the car. I know there's no way to prove it was the employees but it just seems too strange for anyone else."
53,231,"Jun 6 2008 	Great location for Michigan Avenue shopping	The Red Roof is one small block from the main shopping street, Michigan Avenue, and therefore good for a number of shops. Unfortunately it's not close to any subway stop, so you may find yourself taking advantage of one of the many taxis which pass the hotel. Our room was comfortable, with TV, iron/ironboard, hair dryer and air conditioner (although the cool function didn't seem to work ). There was no mini bar, safe or coffee making facilities, although there is complimentary coffee in the lobby. Our room and ensuite looked tired, with flaking paint in the bathroom, chipped bathtub and a toilet which was fitted so close to the wall they had to cut the handle to make it flush properly! But at least it was all generally quite clean.The staff were very friendly and helpful, and they even sent someone to fix our blocked sink within 30 minutes of reporting it!"
54,231,"May 20 2008 	Price and location make it a good place to stay	Visited Chicago from Cleveland with a group of friends. We stayed at the Red Roof 5/08-5/10/2008. The hotel was ok. The rooms could use some updating or maybe a good scrubbing. We had a corner room and a wonderful view. Our group was all on the same floor. The shower was clogged, called the front desk and they had someone to my room within a couple of minutes and it was fixed. The staff was friendly and helpful. There is good coffee in the lobby. The price for this hotel makes this a good option if you don't want to spend a fortune but want to stay in great location."
55,231,"May 19 2008 	Remember it is an ECONOMY Hotel!!!	My friend booked a room in this hotel for us to share while in Chicago for a recent conference. And I'll admit, I was a bit worried after reading some of the comments on this and other sites. But I was very pleased with the hotel, the staff, The LOCATION, and the security.  This hotel is NOT a luxury or resort hotel, and if that is what You are searching for then just skip over it. But if You are a conference attendee, a traveler who plans to spend more time out of the room than in it, or someone who just needs a bed for the night, then You will be pleased. The rooms were small and sparsely furnished, but the beds were comfortable and there was more than enough room to unpack our luggage. The bathroom was TINY but adequate - just had to keep the makeup and grooming stuff out on the closet shelf. The room was obviously worn and dated, but very clean.  The staff were all friendly and charming, and gave each guest their undivided attention while taking care of their needs. Sometimes the lines at the desk were a bit long, but that was because of said attention to detail. I was more than happy to wait or just come back later as I knew I would also have great service.The only 'negative' I can think of was that the 'pseudo-chino' free coffee machine in the lobby was often not functioning - but I don't drink that stuff anyhow, and would throw on a trench coat over my nightie each morning to go across the street to Starbucks. An added plus for conference attendees or super shoppers - there is a post office one block down so You can mail home Your conference materials or purchases!"
56,231,"May 19 2008 	would never stay again	website stated was recently renovated but was not. carpet was stained and filthy. We had a room on the 16th floor and there were ants in the room. There was mildew/mold in the shower. Housekeeping did not make the beds, they changed towels and did nothing else. We talked with the manager on the phone and he said he would talk with us when we checked out but that morning he was unavailable. We would have switched hotels but there was a conference in town and hotels were booked. This hotel has a great location but that is all it has going for it. Very disappointing."
57,231,"May 15 2008 	Impressed!	Clean room, TV, microwave, mini fridge, desk, comfy bed, clean bathroom. For the price and location its worth the stay. The hallways are narrow (so what) and the elevators are pretty tiny and can be slow, but you don't spend your time in elevators and hallways, its the room that counts. There's a Trader Joe's down Ontario about 3 blocks - so you can load up on cheap food/drinks and save a few bucks. Or take that $100 you saved on the Red Roof and splurge across the street at the Capital Grille. Bar Viand also across the street for cocktails and quiet conversations."
58,231,"May 7 2008 	Great Location	Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Red Roof Inn, Chicago and have to say the location is fantastic for the price. One block from Michigan Avenue and within easy reach of Navy Pier, John Hancock Tower and other sites.As other reviewers have said the rooms are quite small but if you only need a place to rest and recuperate after enjoying Chicago then I don't think you can beat this place for the price - we paid just $129.00 per night. The bathroom was small but clean, with a good shower and plenty of hot water.We breakfasted at the West Egg - a great little cafe just around the corner from the hotel. We also had a good evening meal at Copperblue restaurant which is near Navy Pier.All in all if you are on a budget I think that this hotel is ideal."
59,231,"Apr 28 2008 	Made it through one night but would not stay again.	We took a group of teenagers from our church for a &quot;senior trip&quot; for the weekend. Luckily we only stayed one night at this hotel because we did not enjoy our stay. The rooms were small and had a very bad musty smell. The elevator is the smallest I've ever seen and can only hold about 2-3 people with luggage. The hallways are narrow, poorly lit, and dirty. After the first day of sight-seeing, we returned to our room being very hot. We had the air conditioner running the whole time we were gone but it was obvious it was not working. We called the front desk and we were told the A/C would not be turned on until next week. So we roasted the whole night! The only good thing about this hotel is the location. I definitely would not stay again!"
60,231,"Apr 25 2008 	Great location basic service	Red Roof is located in the heart of downtown Chicago, easy walking to the lake, parks, restaurants, shopping. And it is very moderately priced. But it is basic, really basic. Tiny lobby. Tiny rooms. Dingy elevator. Room keys that needed to be reprogrammed twice in one day. If you want a reasonably priced place to stay in the middle of the city, this is an ok choice, but do not expect any amenities."
61,231,"Apr 17 2008 	diamond in the ruff	(if you are in a hurry, skip down to the last 2 paragraphs)We came to Chicago to see Widespread Panic.Just me and my buddy.i had searched for hotels all day on the day before we left and couldnt find anything under 200 - 300$$ in downtown chi-town.we decided to just get our tails over to chicago and see where fate led us.After talking with some people we found there who were seeing the same show and visiting the lobbys of few hotel rooms - still no luck. we did find one place -travelodge, that was willing to &quot;squeeze&quot; us into their sold out establlishment. exicted and happy we would be near the venue we pulled out our cash...then the reality of that visa commercial hit us - i am sure you all have seen it - everything stops when the guy trys to use cash in the symphony of everyone using charge cards? anyway - to use cash they required a 250$ deposit. unheard of. blasphemy. mainly because we didnt have 250 to leave sitting at the front desk until the next morning.Heads down we walked out and down the street - we stopped at a camera shop and the kind people there let us use their phone book to make a cpl calls around and see if we had any luck that way.i remembered red roof being one of the only afordable hotels i noticed online the previous day, (afordable without being downright scary that is). we called them after calling about 6 others. reservations said they had one room left and gave me the local phone #. it was great - we called the local # and the service, latasha and marvette - we're wonderful. they held the room for us until we could get there, no credit card #. they sold us the room without a deposit. i had to call them one time on the way there when we got stuck in traffic to plead for them not to sell our room - i didnt have to beg and marvette said, &quot;your good&quot;.yes it was small - but for us, it was PERFECT. two tour kids that just needed a place to crash under 200$.it was clean and the people inside working and staying were nice alike. the lobby was renovated and two rooms were done as well. the coffee machine in the lobby spun out really great tasting joe and at 2 in the morning when we needed to eat - front desk referred Ranaldi's - the best pizza i have ever had. Chicago was great due in part from the red roof. we checked out the next day and thanked the staff for the kindness yesterday from the other two employees and they exclainmed, &quot;we're nice too!&quot;the place was perfect."
62,231,"Apr 14 2008 	Small but Nice.	I arrived early in Chicago, but they let me check-in anyway. The hotel itself is a bit on the small side, but the king suite had plenty of room. I did not have any noisy neighbors, so I had a good nights sleep. If I return to Chicago again, I will be staying here. The price, $119 on their website, was well within my budget, and from talking to other participants in the summit I was in, much nicer than the $199 &quot;closet&quot; (as one member desbcribed his room) that others paid at the Hyatt regency."
63,231,"Apr 10 2008 	Getting Progressively More Horrid	This is my second stay at the Red Roof Inn.The property is conveniently located off of Michigan Ave and the staff is very friendly accommodating. That is about it.The following things don't work or are not right:a) Second door or hotel opens at turtle speed.b) The elevators are chipped, scuffed, paper all over and dirtyc) The hallway carpets (12th floor as a benchmark) are smelly and filthyd) There is garbage and random ice buckets scattered on the floor next to 1215 for three days of my staye) Rooms smell This property is going down hill and down hill fast. It will be horrid esthetically in no time if the management does not start providing upkeep to the property"
64,231,"Apr 5 2008 	Not that Bad	We read a lot of the negative reviews after we had booked this hotel. We called the property to discuss our concerns and they assured that our room would be well taken care of during our stay. The room was fairly clean but rather small. The bathroom was acceptable but there wasn't much counter space and made getting ready a little difficult.The price (avg $109+tax for three nights) and location more than made up for the size of the room. For a big city, this was not too bad."
65,231,"Apr 3 2008 	Dirty	I stayed at the Red Roof once last month in Chicago for $99 a night, and my room had recently been renovated, was clean with a desk and ample outlets. The location is terrific.Based on those benefits, I decided to stay there again a few days ago. Bad idea. This time I was in a smelly room on the 6th floor that was dirty and dusty. The radiator was very loud and didn't make the room warm, so I finally gave up and turned it off. Plus my room rate was $140. I twice had difficulty getting into the room because my key didn't work. The hallways were narrow and dim, with streaks and scratch marks from people's luggage rubbing everywhere.The people at the front desk asnwer your questions, but do so with reluctance.So, if you decide to stay at the Red Roof, make sure you at least ask for a renovated room!"
66,231,"Dec 3 2007 	Deplorable conditions terrible customer service	You know those hotels where everything goes wrong? This was it. Disgusting, old rooms. The hotel seems to be under the impression that if there is a flat panel TV in the lobby, that makes rooms wired with extension cords run under the carpet and yellow wallpaper acceptable. No hot water in the morning. We checked out, and had to check in to another hotel. They &quot;comped&quot; our rooms. Then mysterious charges appeared on our credit cards. By early December, they had resolved the credit card issues. Location near Michigan Ave. was obviously excellent, but it doesn't make up for such a truly awful hotel."
67,231,"Nov 6 2007	nice location nothing else	A girls weekend, the four of us checked in On Friday. When we started to unpack we notice a leak under the bathroom sink, apparently it had been there a while because of the rust stains.Then we notice the room was not fully vacuum and dirt around the edge of the bathroom floor. So we asked to be moved to another room. We looked at five total and decided that our room 1116 happened to be the cleanest of the six. We stay put until Saturday afternoon. We had packages to drop off drop and the room across the hall was being clean, we looked at it and asked if we could move to 1105 and not be charged anything extra. Yes the manager said. When we checked out Monday morning they wanted to charge us $100.00 more than what was agreed at check in. After talking with two managers at the same time, one being the manager from Sat and 30 minutes later, we were not charged the extra amount.Only two ice machines where working, one on floor 6 and one on floor 15. There are two coffee machines in the lobby however, only one of them worked."
68,231,"Oct 22 2007 	Perfect for my needs	This hotel is certainly not a 4 star class hotel, but I give it 4 stars based on value. To begin with, the location is superb. The week I visited, all hotels were booked and rates seemed to be averaging $250 to $400 per night. The rates at Red Roof Inn were below $150. My corner room on the 15th floor was clean, had a pleasant view of Ontario and Michigan Avenue and was cleaned every day. Granted, the building is old, but does have character. Though not huge, the room was large enough for my needs. No, there is no counter space in the bathroom, but I have encountered this shortcoming in a number of boutique hotels fitted with pedestal sinks. It didnt pose much of a problem. I dont know about the other rooms, but mine was fine. The ice machine on my floor worked fine.The room was outfitted with a small desk and chair, television and air conditioning that worked well, an iron and ironing board, plus a hair dryer. Shampoo and soaps were pretty generic. Id suggest packing travel sizes your favorites if it concerns you. Sheets were not designer label, but they were clean an the bed well made. Plenty of pillows.The staff was professional and extremely helpful. Plenty of wonderful restaurants within a block or two, convenience stores, drug stores - even a Trader Joes. In addition, I was told that within a few months, all rooms would undergo renovation. By all means, if you enjoy luxury accommodations and dont mind paying the price - take advantage of the numerous grand hotels in the area. If you are looking for safe, comfortable friendly lodging in a pristine location, the Red Roof Inn might be the hotel for you. It worked for me."
69,231,Oct 22 2007	Mixed feelings..a more expensive version of the old Cass	When I thought about reveiwing this hotel I tried not to mention the old' Cass hotel but it really is unavoidable.What you get is about the same but for about twice the price. Now let's be fair the 'old' Cass now costs about three times as much and for the money/location I think that the Red Roof is now the only game in town on the Magnificent Mile.Plus Points:Location: Right on N Michigen AveCost: Average of $130 (plus 15% tax plus $5 hotel tax per night)Bad Points:Rooms a little care-worn although clean. A bit like our old friend the 'old' Cass. Carpets have seen better days but OK.Room very poorly litNoisy A/C although not really a problem for me as I can sleep throughanything!Sheets not changed daily Staff a little bit uninterested.Pet PeeveThe drinks vending machine was empty on arrival and still hadn't beenfilled on departure (seven days!)All in all OK and the best value you are going to get these days on the Magnificent Mile. Just don't expect The Ritz.
70,231,"Oct 22 2007 	Dirty room	Great location, staff helpful re. a/c that didn't work. We were prepared for old, grungy room but not for the dirt,hair,whatever in the corners and all around the edge of the carpet....also something splashed on headboard of one bed. Bathroom was clean but toilet seat not well attached on one side. They did give a $60 adjustment ( 4 nights there)when we mentioned the dirty room....we will try very hard to come up with something else next time!"
71,231,"Oct 5 2007	Small Rooms Loud Noises..but close to everything!	Our first stop on our tour of the South was in Chicago at the Red Roof Inn. I was a little surprised to find quiet a small room when I opened the door. The room was ok and seems clean enough. I did notice the way the bathroom door did not stay open and slammed shut everytime one entered or exited the bathroom. You could also not expect to open the bathroom door and room door at the same time as there was not enough room to open both. We also had a street side room and noticed the &quot;singing&quot; of fire engines/ambulances constantly all through the night. As for location, this was by far the best hotel for that! We could walk outside turn the corner and hit the &quot;magnificent mile&quot; shops, water tower place, hancock observatory, wrigley building, and restaurants were very abundant as was a Trader's Joe for picking up any fresh fruit or bottled water. I must make note that one of the staff members, an asian girl, at the front desk was very unfriendly and unaccomadating. Could use a little lesson in customer service. While not a stellar hotel, location was definately a plus!"
72,231,"Oct 5 2007 	Awful	What an awful experience.Walking into the room, I was stunned at how small it was. I couldn't believe they fit two double beds in there. The bed felt like I was sleeping on concrete, towels and sheets seemed to be made of sandpaper. And no matter what I did, the room was always cold and slightly damp. I didn't want to go barefoot anywhere in the room or bathroom. It looked clean enough, but I got the feeling it wasn't. The staff at the front desk was a joke. It took forever for to get someone to the desk to check out. I also asked for a wake up call. Good thing I set the alarm on my cell phone or I'd have overslept."
73,231,"Sep 23 2007 	Not even good enough for my dog !	WE stay at many USA hotels and this by far was one of the worst. We stayed one night and checked out and checked in across the street at the Marriott Courtyard. We were part of a wedding party and had multiple rooms reserved. Many family members ended up following us to the Marriott for the remainder of their stay. Upon check in at the Red Roof Inn, the check in procedure was disorganized, long and unimpressive. The elevators was not working and we had to tow our own luggage up the stairs. When we reached the correct floor, we were unable to find our room, due to missing room numbers. Finally finding our no number room, we entered into a very small room with two double beds that had dirty sheets and wrinkled sheets that obviously had been used before. There were not enough staff to bring us new sheets, we had to get new sheets from the front desk ourselves. We had to make both beds ourselves. The door jam had been forced before and the jam broken. The halls and room were in much need of renovations. The air unit was very noisey with a matallic banging noise all night-we were unable to get any sleep. We had to shut off the air and did not open the window because we were above an outdoor cafe and the chatter from the cafe was loud even with the windows closed-could not imagine how noisey it would be if the windows were opened. That is even if the windows could open. We checked out the very next morning and was given a full refund. So awful of a place and would not recommend this hotel even though the location was superb. We have stayed at other Red Roof hotels around the country and never had such a unpleasant experience with inferior accomendations."
74,231,"Aug 18 2007 	Worst Hotel I've ever stayed at!!!!!	This hotel was very inexpensive compared to others in the area and in a great location, however, I would never return to it again! The room smelled musty, the bathroom tub didn't drain, and there were stains on the sheet and carpet. The lobby had been remodeled and was ok for an inexpensive hotel, but the rooms are in desperate need of work. Only stay here if your budget doesn't allow for anything else and location is a major priority! This is a Motel 6 wanna be!!!"
75,231,"Aug 14 2007 	Wouldn't stay here again	The location is perfect and the staff were pleasant enough, but the rooms are ridiculously small. This was bearable, but my biggest beef is with housekeeping. We stayed from Thursday to Monday and we had maid service only once after specifically requesting it. They made the bed and replaced the towels, but didn't empty the trash or clean the bathroom. The second time they showed up, they thought the room was vacant and so they walked right in to find me standing in nothing but a towel. For the rest of our stay, we just walked into the housekeeping closet and helped ourselves to clean towels.It's a fine enough place otherwise. But don't expect to come back to clean room at the end of the day. I'm not especially picky, but for $190 CAD per night, I expect the bed to be made, clean towels, and the trash to be taken out."
76,231,"Jul 18 2007	Get Out While You Can!!!	About the only pro was that they allowed my party to check in early. Cons: The price I was given for my room was not the price I was charged. I was actually charged $80.00 more a night. (Problem was fixed after four straight days of trying to talk to a manager. They kept blowing me off, that did not make me happy.)The first room I was given had problems with the water draining out of the bath tub.The second room was smaller than my first room (which I could hardly imagine anything smaller than room 1, but they did it).When we closed the curtain gnats came out.The bathroom had a horrible odor.Only one elevator worked and it was slow. They had to call the fire department because something happened to it.The beds were the most uncomfortable things I have ever slept on. You might as well have been sleeping on the floor. The towels and wash cloths were terrible. They were extremely rough and thin. Overall, this was a horrible hotel. I understand that the price was low for the location. However, this is no excuse for any of the above."
77,231,"Jul 12 2007 	Lots of issues- all bad	We ended up with one of the &quot;bad&quot; rooms that others have mentioned. Toilet tank half open, and what you could see inside was a rank combo of mildew and dirt. Generally dirty bathroom with sink and shower not wanting to drain. Dirty carpet that left our socks black, and a musty smell and really loud air conditioner. I went downstairs and asked for an upgrade, and there were no other rooms to be had. The clerk was honest enough to say that about half the rooms had been refurbished, so if you must stay here, ask for a refurbished room. When I went to check out, the clerk refused to check me out because he was running late to get to his day job. He left the front desk unattended, and I had to wait 30 minutes for a new clerk to arrive. Also, do not store your luggage here. When you ask to get your stored luggage, they hand you a key and you get it yourself. I could have taken anything I fancied."
78,231,Jul 9 2007	great location - good night sleep	We attended from Ohio for a wedding. Compared to other area prices it was a steal. I planned only to cleanse and sleep in my room and it was more than adequate. Plan to return in the fall to enjoy more of the city.
79,231,"Jul 8 2007 	Great Location and a Good Experience	From reading the posts prior to coming to Chicago and staying at the Red Roof Inn I was not sure what to expect. But from our own experience we were pleasantly surprised. From the start the staff were very friendly and helpful. We were here for the July 4th holiday.We stayed on the 9th floor and had a corner room. Our room was updated, clean, and our air conditioner worked well. We had a great view of the city and N. Michigan Ave. I think for a $129.00 a night in a city like Chicago and the location of the hotel you cannot beat what we got. If you are looking for 5 star this is not for you. I have to say our room was cleaned everyday!! We live in NYC and know that we would never find this hotel for the price ANYWHERE!! If your looking for a great location in Chicago, no thrills, and not looking for a fancy hotel room and spending hours in it, this is the place for you.It is really close to Navy Pier, Magnificent mile, all shopping, several GREAT restaurants, and public transportation. Some of our favorite restaurants were:Weber Grill (great burgers, ribs, and steak)Bice restaurant, which happens to be next to hotel (Italian)Ballo's (Italian) You must try the meatballs!!!Gino's East Pizza (great deep dish pizza) the 45 min. wait is worth it.Grand Lux Cafe (great breakfast)Tempo Cafe (another great breakfast) order an omlet or pancakesAll of the above were reasonably priced and simply delicious.!!Overall we had a great time in Chicago and would go back again and for the price and location would stay at the Red Roof Inn again."
80,231,"Jul 4 2007 	Got what we expected. Decent great local.	Read all reviews here so we were a little nervous, but were pleasently surprised. We paid 120 a night with Sam's Club membership.We only spent time in the room to sleep, but that is all we needed it for.We were within walking distance of Navy Pier, Broadway in Chicago, Milineum Park, Sears Tower &amp; the Hancock Building, etc. Valet parked our car and we never used it again for the next 5 days.Only complaint is the elevator was very slow &amp; small. We were on the 12th floor and it took a while for the thing to get to the lobby. Room was very small but again we only used to sleep &amp; bath.I will definetly go back. The price was less than half of the next cheapest we could find."
81,231,Jul 1 2007 	Hated the Red Roof Inn	I went in knowing that the room would be very basic and didn't expect much except clean. The room was horrible. Stuffing coming out of the sofa cushions. A toliet seat that clearly hadn't been cleaned. The air vent above the showere filled with dirt and dust. The outlet in the bedroom had no face plate and to top it all off our &quot;clean&quot; towel had dried blood on it. NEVER AGAIN would I stay there.
82,231,"Jun 22 2007 	Locatin location location	I am so glad that I read the reviews on TripAdvisor and reserved a room here. I knew exactly what to expect - not so great room in an incredible location. My boyfriend and I are traveling across the country quickly and only had one day to experience Chicago. We didn't have time to stay somewhere cheaper outside town and take transit or drive and park. We arrived at midnight - the valet parked our car. We didn't see the car again until we left. The staff was polite, but not overly friendly, but we had everything we needed. We crashed as soon as we got into the room, which was very small as indicated on this website. We woke up and hit Chicago, which a half a block away. This hotel is in the best neighborhood - incredible. We walked all over the place during the day and did our sightseeing. We stopped at the room for a quick change of clothes and shower and hit the streets for dinner. The next morning we hit the streets and left. The only negative comment I have is about the air conditioner, which wasn't negative for us. We love having loud white noise in hotel rooms - especially in loud cities. It drowned out any other noise. But if you are used to quiet at night, this air conditioner probably would have bothered you. But the downtown location would probably bother you too. I loved this hotel and would stay again. All the other hotels in the neighborhood were $300+ per night. We paid ~$170 for the Red Roof Inn. If you are picky and want to hang out in a perfect hotel room, this is not for you."
83,231,"Jun 20 2007 	Can't beat the location but wouldn't stay again for anything	Like others have noted, the reason to stay here is the price and location alone. Don't expect any extras, unless you consider a hair dryer and A/C big perks. Room was small and wasn't that clean and the housekeeper didn't bother to come until our third day there. The shower did not drain--disgusting--and housekeeping could not fix it. A/C was full blast or nothing.We came with our toddler and received a crib, but it was stained and old. No refrigerator in our &quot;standard&quot; room, either. Not the best place to bring young children, but we survived. There is an Italian restaurant there, but notfor families with young ones. To their credit, when checking out I mentioned the drain problem and I rec'd an $80 credit adjustment."
84,231,"Jun 17 2007 	Good hotel no problems at all	We have stayed at the Red Roof Inn for 3 days early May. I hesitated for a long time to stay here because of all the bad comments. But for us it was a pleasant surprise. Location perfect.Reception very nice and helpfull. We arrived too early and the room we booked had not been cleaned. We left our baggage and came back after lunch, about 3.00 p.m.Because the room was still not ready they offered us an upgrade to a bigger room without any costs. A nice corner room, with 2 beds, a desk and 2 chairs. Everything was clean.So no complaints at all for $ 116.00 per night!We would come back here again."
85,231,"Jun 14 2007 	Couldn't wait to leave	I should have known better after reading some other comments, but I thought I'd take a chance......big mistake.........filthy...walk barefoot on the carpeting and the bottom of your feet are blackened.......small does not define the bathroom(not even compared to some in Europe)....part of the wall under the shower came crashing into the tub....what an experience......never thought I could say this, but I would have rather paid to stay somewhere else, than stay there for free!!!"
86,231,"Jun 7 2007 	Value Hotel Stands on Excellent Location	i stayed there for 3-nights, that was good experience. All of the hotel was average. My room at 2nd-floor was not spacious but okey. Staffs were not so helpful, but polite enough.Although only 1-block distance from Magnificent Mile, the rate had so much value. So, I recommend this hotel for economy travellers."
87,231,"May 4 2007 	You get what you pay for	The Red Roof is not the most luxurious of hotels but is functional and well located and I would recommend it if you're looking for somewhere to stay on a budget in downtown Chicago.True, the rooms are not huge and the customer service is not great but our rooms were clean and quiet and for the price we paid I would not expect any more.If you want an upmarket hotel, don't stay here, if you want a location right on the Magnificant Mile at a fair price this is a decent option."
88,231,"May 3 2007	basic hotel good location	This is a basic hotel in a good location. The halls are tired, narrow, dirty and noisy. The room is small with a smell of cleaning products covering mildew. No chair or desk in the room. Sheets were clean, towels were small and threadbare. The most challenging aspect was that the door to the bathroom would not stay open. You have to prop it open with the waste basket in order to get any ventilation. It's not the kind of place you take your shoes off in the room. The front desk staff is nice, if under trained. For the location the price is very reasonable. Even though I'm not giving it a very good review, I'd probably stay there again if I couldn't find a better price in the area."
89,231,"Apr 14 2007 	Downtown location not as shown on website	Room was not as featured on website. Too small for conference stay --no desk or chair -- barely enough room for the beds. Not vacuumed prior to arrival- required a call to housekeeping. Refills of daily needs had to be requested- shampoo, glasses, toilet paper. Nice folksworking there, though. Location was good for conference, shopping, restaurants. If money is your only concern, this is the place. Otherwise, we recommend that you call for reservations and ensure that the room meets your needs. There are larger rooms but paying in advance prevented us from upgrading our room, which we attempted to do."
90,231,"Apr 6 2007	Disliked the Red Roof Inn	Chicago: Red Roof Inn Chicago,Illinois Ontario St &quot;Not so clean''Date: April 6th 2007Reviewer: VistorOur family just returned from our trip to Chicago. We stayed in the Red Roof Inn. The first night we stayed there it was okay. When we woke up the next morning my son had really big bumps on his leg all over! My mom went to the front desk and asked them if they clean the beds a lot.They said they change them daily. We went to sleep the next night and he still had them but worse. We asked them about it and they said they are pet friendly. When we left they wern't concered about it. We really didn't like our stay at the Red Roof Inn."
91,231,"Mar 10 2007 	happy with the Red Roof	Receptionist was extremely nice- while we ordered a queen bedroom, she offered to upgrade us with no extra charge to a king bedroom, and also ask for our preferences whether we want upper or lower floor. Also asked if we would be using a laptop and anyhow gave us a very nice and spacious room (1002), which looked like it was quite recently renovated.As previous posts, I concur that the location couldn't be better. On the street the hotel is located are both a good Indian (&quot;Indian Garden&quot;) and Italian restaurant (&quot;Bice&quot;). Also, as recommended in previous posts- the &quot;West egg cafe&quot; is an excellent breakfast option.There is also a cinema complex near by on Ohio st. (just across a &quot;Virgin&quot; mega store).Our only complaint was that this red roof is a t-mobile hotspot, and it didn't function well. We bought a pre-paid weekly pass, and had a lot of problems both with the initial connection to the service and in later on usages. Still, I'm guessing the problem is more related to t-mobile service than to the red roof.Anyhow found the red roof to be a really good deal and had a pleasant stay there."
92,231,"Feb 28 2007 	Great location but better off with Priceline	There is only one reason to stay here - the location 1 block off Michigan Avenue and a few blocks from Lake Michigan is great.That said, there are many reasons not to:- rooms are incredibly small by American standards, and even compared to city centre hotels in a number of European cities- there is no charm- staff is neither rude nor customer service focused- in the summer, you'll tend to get fellow guests in the early 20s looking for a cheap place to stay while they party in Chicago, which may or may not be desirable to you- it's not as &quot;renovated&quot; as they lead you to believe- while not dirty, the room wasn't cleanBut most of all, reviewers focus on the price. Sorry, but that just isn't a sufficient reason to stay here when you can use Priceline. If you've never used Priceline, consider Chicago a great chance to start. In April 2006 I booked a room at the Hyatt Regency on Wacker through Priceline for $75 each night and again booked the same rate during our trip in February 2007 at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. In addition to simply being nicer hotels, both rooms were 2 to 4 times larger than our room at the Red Roof. Literally...So, if location is all you care about, Red Roof can be a good find. If your focus is location and price, due yourself a favor and try Priceline first. You won't regret it, even if you pay a little more. If your focus is anything else, don't think about staying here."
93,231,"Jan 23 2007	Not Worth the Savings	My husband and I got a &quot;VIP&quot;pass at any Red Roof Inn because we had such a DREADFUL stay in the St. Louis location LAST year. We decided to try the &quot;Redesigned Rededicated &quot; Chicago site last weekend. The ONLY thing this hotel has going for it, is the location, right off Michigan Avenue. If not for that, you would think you've landed in some tenement in a seedy side of town.We were greeted by the desk clerk in a friendly fashion, and given our room keys to our 9th floor room. We took the elevator to the 9th floor, and found our room in the corner. The room was no larger than a small college dorm room, and was about 50 degrees! It was shabbily decorated with drab, dirty-looking bedspreads, and non-descript walls. We turned on the heat immediately, and to our surprise the heater started buzzing very loudly. We both agreed we would NOT be able to sleep through the noise, so I asked for another room at the front desk. The clerk seemed surprised that anything was wrong in the first room, but gave us keys to another room on the 2nd floor. (I wondered why he didn't give me this room the FIRST time instead of shippng us up to the 9th)We took our overnight bags to the &quot;new, improved&quot; room, to the 2nd floor to open the elevator door to the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke. Since I had requested a non-smoking room, this did not bode well. However, once we got into our room (again in the corner) and shut the door, the smoke odor was not obtrusive. We decided this room would be &quot;fine&quot; for just an overnight stay. It was slightly larger, but still very small and drab. The window curtains had to be either SHUT completely or opened to all of the other high rises around, as there was no under-liner to let in just the light, but give you privacy. The room being claustrophobicly small, we chose to leave the curtains open until bedtime.Bathroom facilities were minimal......tiny sink, with no place to put toiletries......old tub and toilet that needed to be replumbed, since the toilet &quot;ran on&quot; all night long, even after several attempts to &quot;jiggle the handle&quot;. There was a very narrow shelf over the toilet, but it leaned down toward the toilet, so nothing could be placed here unless you wanted it IN the toilet.If all you require is a place to lay your head that is right off the magnificent mile, and are not going to be spending any time in your room, I suppose this hotel would fit the bill. It IS much cheaper than most. I will say the sheets seemed clean, as did the towels, but the bedspread was questionable at best.We've decided we're going to steer clear of the RED ROOF from here on. It's left a bad taste in our mouths twice in two years. Like the old saying goes, &quot;Fool me once, shame on you.......fool me twice, shame on me!&quot;"
94,231,"Jan 16 2007	great location basic stay	I travelled to this hotel with my Girl Scout troop. We were looking for the best location for as little money as we could get away with. The Red Roof Inn was perfect. The rooms are small, but we weren't in the room for more than sleeping and showers. The front desk staff was very helpful and understood that we were travelling on a tight budget. The hotel was fairly quiet for being so close to Michigan Avenue, we only heard a few ambulances. I would highly recommend this hotel to budget-minded families who want a downtown experience."
95,231,"Jan 15 2007 	Cheap and cheerfull	I booked the Red Roof Inn but didn't expect all that much based on the reviews from here and other sites.However what we got was quite surprising! It wasn't the most fabulous of hotels but it was more than worth what we paid and unless you plan on staying in the hotel all day, you don't need much more than what you get from the place! The reception staff were really really nice. They gave us extra pillows, towels and hangers. Not just one or two like most hotels - they gave us loads. The people behind reception were helpful and friendly. We asked for a few things during our stay and they were super helpful.The room was huge! It was basic but that's what I expected. It had a king size bed when I'm pretty sure I booked a double - bonus! The only bad thing was the fact that the window didn't open but it's to be expected. It was cleaned daily and was always spotless. The location is brilliant. Short walk from Navy Pier, John Hancock Centre, Michigan Avenue and most importantly the Herseys shop!!!!I was so surprised by the Red Roof Inn. I was expecting to be a bit disappointed but it was pretty cool! Would defo stay again."
96,231,"Jan 6 2007 	""Abandoned"" Property?	Everything was satisfactory at this unremarkable hotel, until after we checked out of our room and got to the airport. It was then my husband remembered that he when he took his shoes off the night before, he put them under the bed and forgot to pack them. I called the hotel from the airport (it was only two hours after we checked out) and reported the forgotten shoes. The front desk clerk said there was nothing he could do about it right then and to call back later. I called back a few hours later and he said no shoes had been turned in by the housekeeping staff, but to call back the next morning. I did...and still no shoes were turned in. I found this rather odd b/c my husband knows he left the shoes there and I told them exactly where to find them. I called the Red Roof corporate office and told them about this, and three days later I got a letter saying that any property left in the rooms is considered 'abandoned property.' Abandoned property? Even after I called and reported it within two hours? Somehow I envision a maid's boyfriend or husband walking around with my husband's almost new $150 pair of Timberland shoes. Never will I stay here again or ANY Red Roof in the future. (Before this incident, our overall stay was okay, but the front desk staff could sure use an attitude adjustment. The front desk girl was on a very personal call when we checked in and had us wait while she finished making her after-work plans.)"
97,231,"Dec 12 2006 	Never Again...	As mentioned, the location of this hotel is great and that's about where it ends. The staff was indifferent and non attentive. When we first checked in, the first room we were given wasn't cleaned yet. So we called down to the front and she was non apologetic and just said, come down and i'll give you another room. So back down we went to get a room 3 floors lower.The bathroom left much to be desired with nothing but a tiny sink and toilet- no vanity space, nothing. The room overall was drab and seemed dirty. The windows were so filthy you couldn't see out them. The heater went full blast all the time - there's no other option. 2 tiny pillows, a nasty brown blanket, crunchy sheets and a bedspread that hasn't been washed in a while make up the bed.We stayed here to save a few bucks (we've stayed previously at the Fairfield right down the block) and we'll never do that again. After a busy day in the city, this room wasn't a relaxing refuge to come back to."
98,231,"Nov 28 2006 	Great little place	Great hotel. Rooms were a little narrow, but for the price paid, I expected a lot less. Room was very clean, quiet considering it was in a busy area. Good location, excellent for tourists looking to get a good night's sleep or a short stumble home after a big night out. Checked in very early, 9am, and had no hassles considering their recommendations are 2pm. Friendly and helpful service."
99,231,"Nov 28 2006 	Fantastic Location for basic rates	Just spent three nights at the red roof inn and have no complaints. The hotel is basic as you would expect for the rates but rooms where clean and big enough. Plenty of good places to grab breakfast all within a block if the complimentary coffee in the lobby isn't enough for you.Big selling point for red roof though is location, literally on the Mag Mile which is fantastic and surprisingly clean and hassle free! As w a whole would recommend Chicago and hotel. Worth jumpimg in a taxi (about $15) to wrigleyville for a night out plenty of cool bars.One complaint about hotel, must be on a hospital run as can occasionally hear the wailing of ambulance sirens at night. All in all though good value"
100,231,"Nov 18 2006 	Great Location	OK, so this place is not the Ritz! But what it does have is a fantastic location and rates that cannot be had within a seven block radius on the Magnificent Mile. From here the city of Chicago is laid at your feet for the exploring.The rooms are a bit dated, but I had no troube with cleanliness and my room was spotless. Rooms smaller than normally found in the US, but massive by European standards. Front of house staff were generally helpful and Lashanna in particular was outstanding! Nothing was ever too much trouble for her and she was professional and pleasant throughout.Main down points are the lack of complimentary wireless Internet and breakfast although you can purchase wifi access cards and there is good reception in the room,there is free coffee and tea served all day in the Lounge. Overall, a great choice if you want to see Chicago on a budget."
101,231,"Nov 13 2006 	Terrible Hotel - Too Cramped and Uncomfortable	I stayed at the Red Roof Inn Chicago for the Chicago Marathon weekend. It was a dreaful experience to put it nicely. Here is my list of reasons NOT to stay at this property.1. Front desk staff unattentive and unknowledgable2. Cramped rooms - I've stayed at the W in the financial district and the room was the same size, but did NOT feel cramped.3. Heating system did not work properly - either too hot or too cold4. You could feel the coils through the bed - not good for post-marathon sleep.5. Shower did not have hot water - only took lukewarm showers.6. I booked a room in January and they gave me an &quot;accessible&quot; room - no bathtub!7. No free internet access!On top of all that they were refacing the front part of the building and I had a layer of dirt on my clothes and the bed. I could not believe how horrible that was! I was blowing my nose all weekend - I asked to change rooms and they were unapologetic and did not work with me.DON'T stay at this hotel... there are far better properties in Chicago!!"
102,231,"Oct 30 2006 	Below Average	Why is this hotel such a great deal for being just steps from Michigan Avenue? Because the rooms need serious attention!Housecleaning vacuumed, but didn't bother to go into the corners or next to the bed (we found skittles, M&amp;M's, Advil, and dust bunnies on the floor). They must have used a dirty rag to clean the bathroom. Hair on the walls in the soap tray and top of toilet. The toilet seat was falling off, and when we arrived, there was no soap or extra toilet paper (OOPS!). The bathroom smelled like urine which made us wonder if they even bothered to use disinfectant cleaner. We realized that it was Halloween, but did not appreciate the REAL spider webs all over the windows.Last, but not least, there is a hospital nearby and Ontario is the one way street that the ambulances use to race to the scene with loud sirens and honking horns. Remember, accidents happen at ALL times of the day and night, even at three in the morning. Bring your earplugs!We stayed at this hotel because it was one of the cheapest near MIchigan Ave., and we were just looking for a place to sleep. Now we know why it was so cheap and NOW YOU KNOW WHY ALSO.If you are bringing children, do not even think about staying at this dirty, unsanitary, siren screaming hotel.Buyer beware! You get what you pay for."
103,231,"Oct 6 2006 	Budget-minded Bliss	Nine friends and I decided to stay here while we were in town to run the Chicago Half Marathon. We all wanted to be near shopping and good dining, too , so I suggested the Red Roof Inn Downtown based on other reviews I had read on Trip Advisor. Great Location and great value! Rooms were clean and the staff was okay (some more accomodating than others). After reading about the small rooms, we booked double deluxe rooms (four women / room) . The size was just fine for our needs. However, we could not get rooms next to each other as there is only one doulbe deluxe room per floor. We were able to get a late checkout (so that we could shower up after the race before the long ride home). The staff seemed hesitant to grant this request, but when we explained the reason why, they relented. I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend this place to buget-minded travellers."
104,231,"Aug 29 2006 	Great location for the money we paid	My husband and I just got back from a weeklong trip to Chicago.I was adamant to stay in the downtown or Mag Mile areas despite the high room rates because I wanted us to be in the middle of everything. But we were on a budget.The pros: Rates about half of those for hotels just across the street. Clean rooms and quiet, considering the location of downtown. We had the choice of several king size rooms on different floors - getting a 5th floor room was ideal as it kept noise to a minimum.Location - just a short walk to Water Tower and Hancock. Michigan one block over.A great breakfast place just down the street - the West Egg Cafe.Free coffee, hot water for tea and hot chocolate available at all timesA 24 hour Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins is across the streetPatient staff who answers questions of first time visitors instead of brushing them offWe will definitely recommend them for anyone on a budget who wants to stay in downtown/Mag Mile Chicago."
105,231,"Aug 19 2006	Value and convenience	On the advice of other TripAdvisor members, I requested a king size bed. The room was small, but there was enough room for one person. With two people, it would be quite cozy. Three people - e.g., parents and a child - well, it's probably best to pick a location and stick with it. The elevators are a bit on the slow side. The hallways are narrow and tired looking, but the rooms are fine. The mattress was in good shape, not too soft, not too hard. There are reading lights over the bed and a desk and lamp. The bathrooms are small and the door will not stay open. And if you had the door open you couldn't use the toilet, anyway. There was plenty of hot water. There is no extra counter space. My sink and toilet top slanted forward, so anything not carefully place would slide into the sink or toilet. The tub is not low sided nor does it have grab bars, so if you have a disability plan ahead to get a room that is accessible. The tub does have some texture on the bottom so it is not slippery.Wi fi is available for a fee. If you are only there for a day or two you might want to get day passes ($9.99). One month's access is $39.99. I lucked out and got an end room, which had two windows, so connection strength was excellent. The desk clerk said it was not very good in some rooms, in which case the guest has to come down to the lobby.The lobby is nice with places to sit, a TV, and tourist info. There are two machines that offer a variety of coffees, hot water, and hot chocolate all day. There are no steps to deal with, an automatic door, and valet parking available.But the shortcomings of this place are overlooked by the great value and great location. It's cheaper or as cheap as any other place downtown. With an AAA discount, my rates ranged from $80-$98/night (depending on whether it was a weekday or weeknight). It's within easy walking distance of many restaurants, some of which are recommended in travel guides. There are small food stores, drugstores and a laundromat within a few block radius. There is a subway station about 4-5 blocks away, but Michigan Avenue is but a block away and you can catch many buses there. While the room is average, the problems can be overlooked. I rate this property above average because of price and location."
106,231,"Aug 16 2006 	Great value for money for Chicago	I was a bit worried about this place from some of the reviews....but I needn't have been. The staff was courtious, the hotel was clean (albiet small), and the location could not be better. If you like luxury hotels and spend most of your time on vacation in your hotel room...splurge and stay somplace else. But if you intend to spend your time experiencing Chicago and just sleeping in your room at night....this is the place for you (and you'll save yourself a good $100 per night!) I paid $140/night."
107,231,"Aug 4 2006 	Excellent value	We stayed at the Red Roof over the July 4th holiday, we have stayed in Chicago before and have paid more than $220 for a nice hotel, this cost us $110 a night inclusive of tax. The rooms are very clean and whilst reviews on this site state the rooms are tiny I would say they are smaller than a standard motel room but not tiny(we were travelling route 66 and this was our first stop on a 3 week stay so we had plenty of luggage). The location as most reviews have stated is superb and cannot really be beaten. The free coffee in the foyer is a nice touch in a morning although it is available 24 hours. Overall we were impressed with the Red Roof and would have no hesitation whatsoever in staying again,"
108,231,"Jul 24 2006 	Great Location	Stayed for 3 nights. Originally rqstd one bed-got two (booked on-line 3rd party). Room quite small w/two beds. Have to shift body sideways to let other person by, though rooms/bath (tiny) are very clean. Went to front desk that evening and spoke w/Allyn who was incapable of a securing a next day room change and was told to speak to anyone the next morning. Valerie the next morning, was quick and courteous to help locate a one bedded room. Rm804 queen. Though it was a smoking room, what a difference! Much roomier room and bathroom; figured out it was a handicap room, complete w/writing desk and chair. Definitely made the stay more enjoyable. Thanks again to Valerie who was kind and helpful! Erica was great at c\i &amp; c\o, and w/local brkfst. recommendations. Go to West Egg Cafe for breakfast 'til 3pm, if your a late sleeper, two blocks away. All $hopping w/in walking distance. KING TUT exhibit 'til Jan.30 is disappointing-no sarcophagus. Get tickets in advance, sells out quickly for the day."
109,231,"Jul 18 2006	Loved the Red Roof Inn	We stayed at the Red Roof Inn in downtown Chicago in June, 2006, after reading the reviews at this website. The rooms were tiny, as are most in the high rise hotels in Chicago, but very clean and well equipped. I brought my own coffee maker to use in the room because they don't have them, but they have gourmet coffees available in the lobby 24 hours a day. There is also a Starbucks right across the street. The hotel is very centrally located, walking distance to just about everything. It is a little noisy with all the traffic if you want to sleep in, but great for being in the midst of everything. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and everyone always had a smile on their face. The parking was extremely expensive, and the amount changed from when I called to inquire about it. The website said to call for current rates, I called two nights before my arrival date. They said $28.00, and then it was $33.00 a day by the time I checked out. They apparently switched valet companies on me during my stay. But other than that, it was a great place to stay, much cheaper than the surrounding hotels, and I would stay again in a second!"
110,231,"Jul 11 2006	Great Location good value	We booked the hotel based on the comments below and agreed it's a good value for money. It's located in the hotels district which is close to many restaurants, cinema and just next to the shopping street. The following sights are all within walking distance: Museum of Contemporary Art, HIstoric Water Tower and Pumping Station, LUMA (which is showing a very interesting exhibition &quot;The Gods as We Shape Them&quot; through Sep 10) and the Hershey's Chicago store."
111,231,"Jul 6 2006	Wonderful location nice rooms great service	We visited Chicago for the first time June 30, 2006 - July 3, 2006. We booked the Red Roof Inn - Chicago based on price and the reviews on this website and other travel books. It was wonderful. I am used to staying in very nice, expensive hotels but I didn't want to pay Four Seasons or Intercontinental prices for this trip. We booked our room for $107 a night which is a steal. That was with a AAA motor club discount. The location is amazing. It is half a block from the Magnificent Mile, it is in a safe, well lit area. There are many restaurants near by (next door, across the street) which stay open VERY late. As we have never been to Chicago before but to NYC, Boston and LA many times, we were not used to city stores/restaurants shutting down early. That wasn't a problem in the area we were. Check in was very quick and easy. We had such a great rate that the front desk man actually asked when we booked because he had not seen a rate that low in ages. He also said they were not participating in the AAA discount anymore (which was not a problem for us and we had booked when they still took that discount). We requested a king bed, non smoking, renovated room facing Ontario St. I read in many online/book reviews that rooms facing Ontario St had more light and better views. They were nice enough to oblige and we got everything we requested. Our corner room was on the 11th floor and it was very nice. The only complaint I had was that it smelled musty. I think the smell was coming from the air conditioner. But we got used to it. The room was nicely appointed (king bed, tv, alarm clock, night stands, desk, chairs) and it was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable (and I have a very bad neck/back). The view was very nice. We had a view of Michigan Ave from one window and of Ontario St from another window. The bathroom was fine. It definitely was small but clean and the bath/shower has a curved rod so there is more room. The room looked just like it did in the pictures online. I would have taken pics for this review but I forgot my camera!The elevator was small and slow and not air conditioned but that was easy to deal with. They have valets (which we did not use) and sort of door men who called cabs for us.Free coffee, hot chocolate, tea in the lobby. I would definitely stay here again."
112,231,"Jul 2 2006	Great location and good value for money!	We stayed at the Red Roof Inn, Chicago, for 4 nights in June. The location is great - a half block from the Magnificent Mile (Michigan Ave) - lots of shopping. We walked to most locations. Caught the Chicago hop-on/hop-off bus for the first 2 days. The first day we re-acquainted ourselves with the city (it's been 6 or 7 years since we last visited Chicago.) We took the Heritage bus tour too. The next day we hopped off at the Museum of Science and Industry and saw the wonderful Da Vinci Exhibition. Another day, we boarded the Wendella Chicago River and Lake cruise (1 1/2hrs). It was a beautiful clear blue sky day and the tour was another 'winner'! The Inn is in an area that's scattered with lots of eateries - TGIF, O'Neill's Bar, a cute all-day Corner cafe where lots of locals eat/take-away breakfast/lunch etc and a chinese restaurant across the road from the RR Inn and the usual take-away 'joints'... your choice of food and prices... Check-in/check-out were quick and painless (I had booked on the web and pre-paid) Front Desk staff were friendly and obliging when we asked for advice on where to get a snack. Our 10th floor room was small, but had a really comfortable king size bed (my husband is 6'4&quot; and I really appreciated that the request for a queen size bed, had been taken into consideration). The bathroom was small - shower/bath combination. The toilet was also in the bathroom. Our airconditioned room overlooked the street and the building opposite. It was quiet enough (just the usual doors slamming in the corridor with inconsiderate patrons) Chicago is a clean, green (Australia is still suffering from drought conditions!) and the architecture is wonderful!"
113,231,"Jun 12 2006	Good Location small rooms!	This is a great location when visiting Chicago. It is within walking distance of everything. The hotel staff is very nice and easy to work with. The rooms and the elevators are TINY!! Two people couldn't walk around at the same time. We had one room with a king size bed and a different room with 2 doubles and the beds took up the entire room. The elevator was very small. It was clastrophobic. Our a/c was broken, so the staff transferred us to another room. The staff was very knowledgeable when it came to the train station. Very good stay except for the size of the rooms."
114,231,"Jun 1 2006	A perfect location	I recently stayed for 1 night at the Red Roof Inn downtown Chicago, I booked it tjrough Expedia and got a very good deal.I was very surprised when I arrived, to discover its location, for this price, it was VERY centraly located, around the corner from Michigan Avenue.The hotel is not the best I have stayed, but for this budget it worked fine for me.The rooms are a bit dated and need refurbishement, but bathrooms are very nice and clean.Moroeover the frontdesk and cleaning staff were very nice and helpful, doing their best to please us.One thing was missing though : no restaurant to get breakfast at the hotel, there is only a free coffee machine in the lobby..but it was no problem for us as there was plenty of places to eat in the morning, especially a nice bakery with a terrace around the corner from the hotel.Overall I would recommend it to travellers on a budget looking for clean, cheap &amp; central accomodation in Chicago."
115,231,"May 23 2006	Very good value and location	I agree with many of the positive comments written so far about the Red roof. Rooms are indeed quite small, but we took the business king suite (10$ more than a regular room) that had two washrooms, a king bed and a queen sleeper sofa  perfect for two adults and three children. There was a fridge + microwave, two TVs and everything was quite clean. It's a great location, and for the price, a very good deal. The staff is also very helpful.Finally, I share the same opinion with others that mentioned that it's an older building, with elevators that are rather small and slow and the noise from the street can sometimes be heard. That being said, I find those points to be rather secondary in relation to the other good aspects of this hotel."
116,231,"May 12 2006 	Borderline Accommodations	I stayed here on business May 2. You get what you pay for. It was the least expensive suite hotel in the area and for a reason. Just a little creepy based on the clientele, hotel staff and old building. I stayed here to see if I could/should bring my family here this summer for sightseeing. Compared it to the Seneca and Homewood Suites and will choose one of the others. Red Roof has the best location but just barely met my modest standards. It isn't for the family."
117,231,"May 5 2006	Good location	This hotel could not be in a better location. It is a block from the Magnificent Mile and some really good restaurants (including The Cheesecake Factory). The lobby has just been updated and the staff was very nice but the rest of the hotel is very old and a little run down. The rooms were very small and not very nice but we were just there for a long weekend and it worked. As long as you are not claustrophobic you should be ok. The lobby has plenty of information for visitors and taxis are easy to catch out front. Because everthing is tight fitted, noise is an issue for those morning birds or late night guests who don't know how to respect other guests. You should request a low floor because the elevator seems to always be crowded and takes forever. Also, don't plan on showering before check out time because there was no hot water!"
118,231,"Apr 30 2006	Good location clean (but small) rooms	For the price, a very good deal. It's a great location, and our room was clean--if quite small--with a comfortable, king-sized bed and small desk with comfortable chair and 25 inch TV.It's an older building, so the heaters are noisy and not always totally effective, and the elevator is tiny and slow (especially if you stay on the top floor). Also, keep in mind it's often used by school groups, and the walls aren't especially thick, so it can be noisy at times, but we never had trouble sleeping. Staff are friendly and helpful."
119,231,"Apr 23 2006	Location Location Location	The best thing about this hotel is it's location. You cannot move for shops restaurants, bars etc.The price of the hotel was reasonable and in comparison to the other hotels in the immediate area was probably quite cheap.The hotel is in an old building. The foyer has been modernised and is quite comfortable with very good friendly staff. The lifts to the rooms are small and are often quite busy. The rooms themselves are small and whilst the bartroom was clean it was evident that the hoover did not reach the corners of the room with a thin layer of dust running around the edge.If you are fussy kind of person then you will find plenty to fault this hotel. If you are using it as a base for exploring this great city, are not spending too long inside the rooms and are sensible with your money then this hotel makes a great deal of sense."
120,231,"Apr 19 2006 	Great small hotel -- keep fire safety in mind	The Red Roof Inn Chicago is a great small hotel property in the city and the location is prime. It's just a few blocks away from the main thoroughfares and in a good neighborhood between the hospital campus, other hotels, and busy restaurants.Front desk staff is very courteous and the few times I called for assisance I got quick responses. Like many old properties hallways are small, elevators smaller, and rooms are not traditional U.S. size. But they are not jammed either and the owners have invested in contuing upgrades to the public areas and rooms and the decor is very current in all areas with good lighting and comfortable furnishings.Not many people consider fire safety when they select a hotel, and older properties have their own challenges. Nevertheless, my stay at the Red Roof Chicago was the first time in a while that I was conscious of the fact that I was in a building with no central sprinklers, and the two exit stairs consist of one internal staircase around the corner from the main hallway, and a rear fire ESCAPE (i.e. an outside metal-mounted staircase/ladder), not a stairwell. Federal employees generally are required to stay in newer properties with more fire safety systems, and I am in no way suggesting that the property is not safe -- in fact, hallways were always clear, well-lit, alarm system appeard to be upgraded, and there are fire extinguishers/hoses. But it's worth remembering that not all hotels have the same level of life safety technology available. At the very least, just being a little more aware of fire exit locations is a good idea when staying in an older property like this one."
121,231,"Apr 19 2006	Great Location but Horrible Hotel	I travel all over the world and I would not stay at this hotel again. Although the location is perfect, the place is old and disgusting. There was hair all over the bathroom walls and the floor was dirty. One crumby dresser with a TV on top. The room was tiny. Heat was broken and noisy and we ended up getting $50 off because they couldn't fix it. Also there is only one tiny elevator and there was a convention in the hotel so we had to wait a long time for the elevator whenever we wanted to go out. Shop around or walk an extra block and pay a few dollars more because this place is NOT worth it."
122,231,"Mar 6 2006	Red Roof Inn a cheap gem!	Stayed at the Red Roof Inn in Feb 2005. First of all, great location, one block from North Michigan and the shopping! Check-in was all of one minute, and I was in my room immediately! It is an older hotel, so the carpet is not brand new, but I don't choose a hotel for the carpet. My room was extra clean and bathroom was immaculate. The only &quot;disappointing&quot; thing I encountered was the ice machine on the 2nd floor where I stayed. It was broken, so I went to the 9th floor where the other is located. That gave me all but 3 ice chips after about a 5 minute wait. I highly recommend this hotel. I will definitely stay here again."
123,231,"Jan 24 2006	I would not reccomend this hotel ever!!!!	This is not a friendly place to stay. After making reservations months in advance,my husband and I enter our room only to discover that they gave us a queen size bed when I had requested a king. So we hauled our lugage back down to the front desk. I told the employee about the mistake and he told me that there were no more king size rooms avalible. I told him that I wanted the room I had made reserations for(I had a confirmation #) or a discount on the room that was given to us. After talking with a manager(via phone)I was given a key to a king size room(I thought that they were none left). No one apologized to me. The room itself was clean but small. I would not stay at this or any other Red Roof Inn again."
124,231,"Dec 14 2005	Location Location Location ....and great price	After reading the reviews here and a personal recommendation from a friend, we decided to try this Red Roof Inn. Me and 2 other friends traveled to Chicago for a girls weekend and knew we wouldn't be in the hotel much. We were just looking for a safe, clean place close to the shopping and sight-seeing areas. This suited our needs. It's nothing fancy. We had a suite and were pretty satisified. The full bath was very, very cold since it was on an outside wall and had a window. But the water temperature was good. Heater was very hot in one room and cool in the other. Our suite had a refrigerator and microwave, but no coffee pot in sight. Coffee is only available in the lobby and only in the morning. Room was clean and furniture in good shape. Requested non-smoking room, but was given smoking with no option to switch to another non-smoking suite. Only offered a non-smoking double. We checked out the suite and decided it wasn't too bad. Although the hall reeked of smoke some mornings. The desk staff could have been friendlier (except for one exceptional young lady there) and they need to invest in coffee pots for each room. Visit West Egg Cafe down the street for breakfast (get there early to avoid the line) and Joey Buona's for great Italian (pizza and pasta)."
125,231,"Nov 21 2005	Good Location and Good Price	The Red Roof Inn is in an ideal location if you want access to Michigan Avenue. The hotel is located near many eateries and bars (Try O'Neils - 3 store fronts down from RRI, the bar is only 12 feet wide but a great time). The staff of the hotel was very friendly and helpful. The only issue we had with the hotel was our room was not clean. There was some issues in the bathroom and trash on the floor. The hotel rooms are very small as well, but as long as you do not want to hold a social in your room, your ok. I would stay here again based on price and location."
126,231,"Nov 21 2005	Downtown Chicago bargain	We visited Chicago the first weekend in November with our two teenage sons. We were looking for something affordable yet close to the sights and booked the Red Roof Inn based on reviews here at Trip Advisor. The hotel was exactly what we were looking for: inexpensive, in the heart of downtown, clean, friendly staff. Yes, the room was a bit crowded for 4, but we weren't there much and the convenient location was more than worth it! It was perfect for a family on a budget. Don't stay there if you want luxury or extras, but if you are happy with the basics, it's the right place for you!!!"
127,231,"Nov 21 2005	Great Hotel	This is one of the best hotels in Chicago because of its price and location. It's half a block away from the Magnificent Mile and is surrounded by very good restaurants. There are also convenience stores near the hotel. Very convenient to public transportation. We stayed in a standard room during our first night. The room was small but clean. The bed was comfortable. The next night, we moved to the King Suite which had a lot of room for 3 people. The staff was very helpful and friendly."
128,231,"Nov 12 2005	Impressed with the Red Roof Inn	Very well located, clean and pleasant rooms - I would stay here again in Chicago!"
129,231,"Nov 8 2005	Great Place Great Location Great Price	Just got back form the Red Roof Inn Chicago. First the location is EXCELLENET-  Block from everything you want on the magnificent mile, and next to it is the Marriott (whose prices were 3x that of the red roof inn). The rooms were nice. We got a king Suite with king bed and bath in one room and a separate living room with fold out bed and its own bath. We also got a double deluxe with a big room and two double beds. The staff was very friendly and helped us with everything we needed. We had a late flight leaving and we were able to store our baggage after we had checked out and they have internet that you can rent. The are remolding and it looks like the place will be ever better the next time we stay there. This is not a 5 star but it is a wonderful place for the price, I HIGHLY suggest the red roof inn."
130,231,Oct 28 2005	Great Location	I stayed at the RRI this summer my teenage son and nephew. I got the deluxe room with two double beds. I guess by getting the deluxe room we did not have the problems some other reviewers had with storing luggage and moving around. There was an area outside the bathroom for our luggage and clothes. We left the hotel early each morning and returned late at night so we were only there to sleep. The room was clean and the location is great. I did not want to spent a lot on a hotel so the RRI was perfect for us. We ate at the Corner Bakery which was a block away for breakfast.
131,231,"Oct 27 2005 	Great value great location no frills	I was pleasantly surprised by my short, early week stay here. The location is perfect, in the heart of downtown close to great restaurants and bars. But don't stay here if you want the extras, they don't have them. There is no one waiting at the door to assist you with your baggage, the rooms are small and the bathroom smaller, you may have to go to another floor for ice. I would estimate it's been 15 years or more since the carpet has been replaced. Although they just started re-doing the small lobby the day I left.However, the staff was friendly and helpful and you can't beat the price for this area of town. I would definitely stay here again."
132,231,"Oct 17 2005	Mediocre Hotel	We paid only $80/night by booking through Expedia. The location is great...a short walk to the Magnificent Mile and bus stops. The subway stop is several blocks away though. The room is too small for more than two people in my opinion. My partner and I had just enough space for ourselves and two suitcases. The hotel only has two small slow-moving elevators serving 16 floors. The elevators were often full, and we would have to wait for it to come around again.We were given a smoking room even though I had requested non-smoking. One of the bedspreads had several dark brown stains, and we requested to have it changed on our first morning there. I pulled the bedspread off, and then I placed it on the floor with the stains clearly visible. The housekeeper made the bed with the same stained spread. I called and requested a new spread again, and then I made the bed myself once it was delivered. The bathroom was very clean -- a definite plus. None of the front desk staff members we encountered were personable. We talked to several staff members, and none of them seemed enthusiastic to be there. Two different staff members were engaged in obvious personal calls while checking in guests. (One was talking about her baby shower, and another one was making plans for later that night.) I requested a second luggage rack, but my request was denied because they do not keep extra on hand. Overall, we were not real impressed with hotel. The price was great, but the staff and cleanliness were not impressive."
133,231,"Oct 5 2005	Better than the price indicates.	Last year I stayed at the hotel across the street from the Red Roof Inn. This year, that hotel's price went up about $80 a night. This required a change in accomedations for this year's trip. We had seen the RRI last year and decided that it was worth looking into for this year's trip. Boy am I glad I did that. It's the same location for half the price.When I judge a hotel, there are two things I look at. The first is the bathroom and the second is the cleanliness. At this RRI, the bathrooms were a little tight around the toilet, but the shower is roomy. The rooms were very clean and the housekeeping came every day. We got rained on two of the days we were there and the front desk gave us extra towels with no questions. These rooms are small and there is minimal furniture in them. They are shapped like a long rectangle with the door and the head of the beds against the long side. There's about 3 feet from the end of the bed to the other wall. This makes them feel smaller than they are. If you have more than one piece of luggage per person, the room will get crowded as there is no real good place to store you bags. We paid extra for a refridgerator and microwave and it was worth every penny. There was a desk in a corner and a small dresser with the TV on top of it. The hangers were at the far end of the room near the bathroom.I do want to stress that for the price, this is the best hotel near Michigan Ave."
134,231,Sep 25 2005	happy staff/ happy customers/equals a great stay	my wife and i stayed at the red roof from sept 10 to 15th we got the L train from ohare to clark st $1.75 each and a$6.00 cab to the hotel the staff were very pleasant for the whole visit and any advice or tips were no problem to them the location was great 50 yards from michigan avenue and 10 to 15 minutes stroll to navy pier loads of resturants and bars nearby the room we got on the 15th floor was very clean and tidy and had two double beds we paid $700 you could pay a lot more for something more upmarket but if your their to see the city and not law and order 2 times a night this hotel was just fine enjoy
135,231,Sep 16 2005	Good Experience for the Price	We stayed at the Red Roof Inn when we were in town for a wedding. I wasn't expecting much and was pleasently surprised. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The location is fantastic. The room was smaller than I expected - even for a city hotel. If you are traveling as a couple alone I would suggest requesting a room with one king sized bed. Our room had 2 double beds and it was difficult to navigate. We had trouble finding places to put our suitcases!Overall it was a good experience.
136,231,"Aug 28 2005	Great Value	This hotel is a wonderful suprise. Like every other review says, the rooms are small. But if you are in Chicago and spending your time in your hotel room other than to sleep, there is something seriously wrong. This hotel is very clean and quiet. It is so close to everything. It is only one very small block from Michigan Ave. All city transit is very close and accessible. All the major shopping is close. It is close to restaurants. Anything you could possibly need. The West Egg cafe is the place for breakfast. Just one block from the hotel. There were line ups for this place every morning we were there. My only complaint of the hotel is that there was only one staff on at night. We had called down to the front desk for more glasses and we were asked if we could come down and get it as they were the only one working at the time. But for the price we paid it was a small inconvience. We had looked at other hotels in the area that were almost twice the price and i am very glad we did not pay the extra. This really is a great value hotel. Also for deep dish pizza, you have to go to Gino's East, probably the best pizza i have ever had. It was about a 5 - 10 min walk from the hotel straight down Ontario St."
137,231,"Aug 11 2005	Great Value 	I want to say first, that i was very nervous about what to expect. I had read a lot of reviews on your site about Chicago hotels and the prices being paid...i didn't know what to expect. Boy was i ever PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!The Red Roof Inn is a very nice hotel in the heart of Downtown Chicago. I read about small rooms, but the key i found was getting the &quot;KING SUITE&quot;, like $10-$15/night more...it was plenty of room for my wife and i and 2 teenagers (they slept on the fold out sofa), 2 TV's, 2 Bathrooms, Microwave &amp; Fridge in the room. We paid $130/night, compared to $200-$300/night in hotels that we walked past on a daily basis (i.e. same location).The Best part of the deal was the location. You are literally 1 short block off the heart of Michigan Ave/&quot;Magnificent Mile&quot;. Free Trolleys run to all the places we wanted to go (museums, shopping, navy pier, parks, etc.) which you can catch within 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Lots of wonderful restaurants, we took the Amtrak to Chicago from San Antonio (wanted to &quot;experience&quot; the train) and never rented a car. We did mostly the trolleys and a few cab rides.Again, the room was very nice (not the 4 Seasons, but comfortable beds, nice linens, and very clean...plenty of hot water). This is a GREAT place for budget minded families who are more interested in Chicago and a nice place than a &quot;palace type room&quot;.By the way, I tried the Garrett's Popcorn (caramel corn), it was AWESOME...i knew it had to be good when i counted 32 people standing in line waiting to get it on Michigan Ave...well worth it if you like caramel corn.Thanks TripAdvisor....i will ALWAYS use your site in my future travels"
138,231,Jun 18 2005	Good Deal	Stayed here for 5 days. Decided to get the business 17&quot; TV and got a pretty spacious room. Suspect by paying a little extra got a slightly bigger room which was more than adequate for the price and well worth it.Location is extremely good. The only down side was that the toilet was &quot;wedged&quot; against the wall meaning it was uncomfortable to use. Not sure why this was done as there was plenty of space to move it out a little.Would stay here again.
139,231,"Jun 7 2005	Wow!! Small rooms	My friends and I stayed at the Red Roof Inn from June 3-6. I had trouble deciding between 2 and 3 stars. The room was very clean, which is wonderful, but it was SO SMALL!!! We just could not get over how small the rooms were. I had read reviews in which they said that, but thought, &quot;How small could they REALLY be?&quot; and booked there anyway. The answer: SMALL!!! :) There was hardly anyplace to store our luggage or anything, no room to walk at all, and the bathroom was tiny too. It reminded me of some of the tiny hotel rooms you see in Europe or something. The front desk staff was nice enough. This is definitely a no-frills hotel, and you get what you pay for. So, the good things were that it was a clean hotel, but if I had to do it all over again, I would pay a little more money and stay someplace nicer."
140,231,"Jan 22 2005	Excellent place to stay!	Great place, location, and price! If you want to go to the windy city for a couple of nights, this place is perfect. You are just a few steps away from Michigan Ave. My room was clean when I arrived, and was cleaned every morning. My only complaint is with the heat in the room. It was about 10 degrees outside, and the heater was blowing cold air. I went to the front desk to ask for a blanket. (I'm thinking for the rate I'm paying at this place, asking for an extra blanket is fine. I could be paying $400/night across the street at another hotel, and still have the same problem.) Not a big deal to me. When I came back to the room the next day, they had replaced the heating unit in my room! The staff was very friendly. It is not a place for those looking for the treatment you receive at some other hotels. There is no free breakfast, no bellhop, no room service, and no USA today paper delivered at your door. (I think a free paper might have been available at the front desk though, as well as free coffee) Valet parking is available. I paid $24 for it. If I chose to park the car myself and carry my stuff to the room, it would have been $22. 2 extra bucks well spent in my opinion. Best value in downtown Chicago!"
141,231,"Oct 11 2004	Great Place for the Price	You probably cannot find a hotel with a better location in Chicago at a rate anywhere nearly as reasonable as the Red Roof Inn. The rooms are small and somewhat out of date, but if you are in Chicago, why are staying in your room anyway? Get out, eat the great food and have fun. We asked the staff for recommendations, and received great advice on restraurants and cafes. Although I consider this a good place to stay when you are in Chicago for fun, I could not recommend the Red Roof for a business stay, unless your goal is to save money."

2,244,"Nov 18 2009 	Outstanding facility very comfortable everything service could be warmer.	I stayed one night on business. Had a room on the 16th floor (right across from elevators, but no noise issue at all during the night -- but kind of wondered what the big deal is about being Silver Level in the hotel's program if that gets me right across from the elevators with a so-so view). Great work space, plenty of strong lighting, easy electrical access, and easy to use (t-mobile) wireless. Terrific TV (flat, huge, swivels). Well-stocked mini-bar. Well-designed closet, generous sized bathroom with nice design and level of quality furnishings. Shower pressure excellent. Speaker phone by the loo ... a little odd. Bedding extremely comfortable -- extremely. Room service dinner. Hamburger cooked medium -- if you don't like bright pink, go for medium well. Fine size portion and above average quality. Breakfast was very fine. Fast service. Ordered the basics (oatmeal and toast -- the best oatmeal and toast ever; that might sound underwhelming, but order it and see for yourself).Had a box delivered, room service delivered, restaurant breakfast, counter check in, and doorman hailed a taxi. The doorman was very helpful with luggage and making sure I knew where I was going. Everyone else was efficient and pretty business-like, in contrast to the Sofitel in Manhattan, where everyone was friendly and welcoming. That was a little disappointing. Still, I'd stay there again, business or pleasure."
3,244,"Nov 12 2009 	Pretty Decent	Stayed for 3 nights across the weekend of the 23 Oct as part of our honeymoon. Thos hotel was everyhting we had wanted and expected it to be.Friendly and efficient check in staff &amp; Bell Boys. Clean, modern room with views - we were onthe 27th floor. Attentive service (told them it was our honeymoon in advance and got some free strawberries dipped in chocolate.Good location close to Mag mile and 1 block from the subway if wanting to go down to the loop but Chicago is a pleasure to walk around.Didn't eat inthe hotel as have plenty of option close by.One grip would be we were kept awake by some very noisy machanical sounds on a number of night which went on constently - could have been the lifts but more likely the air con units onthe roof (not our in room air con as it was switched off). Quite annoying but otherwise a ver pleasent stay."
4,244,"Nov 9 2009 	Excellent trip	The trip was excellent. The rooms were clean, and the beds were super comfortable.The hotel staff professional and they took care of every need. They had taxis waiting on the street if you needed one or provided suggestions and/or walking routes if needed. The only complaint that I had was the rooms were a little smaller than expected. The hotel is also close to Rush St. which has a lot of good restuarants like Mike Ditka's Restaurant and the Original Pancake House."
5,244,"Nov 7 2009 	Comfortable	I came to Chicago on business and needed somewhere comfortable and hassle free. The hotel met my needs and I would recommend it both for business and leisure. The hotel is just to the north of the main business district, at the start of the Mag Mile, so well placed for shops and the Hancock Tower. The room was big, with a very comfortable bed and a flat screen TV. The view was great. The bathroom was modern and clean with white fluffy towels and Occitane toiletries. I asked to change from the 11th to the 21st floor to get a better view and my request was accommodated. Breakfast was good. There was no buffet - everything was a la carte. Breakfast was on the expensive side - US$16 for a bagel, coffee and orange, but there is a great diner literally one minute's walk away (Tempo) which is very popular with locals if you wanted to experience something more authentic. The breakfast room and bar are at ground level which seems a shame given the great views from higher up. There is no pool but there is a gym. There is also free internet access on level 2. There is a good buzz in the evening in the bar and there is a wide range of cocktails. All in all, a comfortable place to stay in a safe neighbourhood, and well placed for the shops and transport."
6,244,"Nov 3 2009 	Great Hotel right by the Magnificent Mile!	We lucked out and got half off of the rooms. The hotel is in a great location for walking to the subway (the El), and the Magnificent Mile. Also the Hancock Tower is just a couple of blocks away, right on the Magnificent Mile. The service was excellent, and we had no complaints during our stay! If you stay here, you are getting great service and a great location, guaranteed! Extra notes, walk out the front door and take a right, there's a great breakfast place called Tempo Cafe!"
7,244,"Oct 26 2009 	Totally awesome.	Chicago was so fabulous, we decided to stay on for a few days after our conference ended, and wound up at the Sofitel due to the reviews here and a special price the Sofitel was offering. It was the best decision possible. First of all the Sofitel rooms are exquisitely comfortable, with perfect beds, pillows, robes, slippers, lots of storage for all your clothes and impedimenta, and gorgeous baths with tub and separate shower stall with great shower head. The modern decor is surprisingly warm and spacious-feeling, much nicer &quot;in person&quot; than the internet photos suggest. The lobby and common areas are quite nice. The restaurant is rather expensive even by Chicago standards (e.g., $18 for a turkey sandwich) but the quality of our breakfast meal of Belgian waffles ($16 pp including choice of juice) and French-press coffee was very nice, presented and served perfectly. A nice extra: the Sofitel room safes are large enough for a widescreen laptop if you kitty-corner it in. The widescreen TV was an LG, with no loss of perspective, i.e., the picture wasn't oddly stretched. Free computer access is available on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Front desk, door, bellman, and housekeeping service is impeccable. Our room overlooked the western part of the city, which isn't terribly inspiring, but the high-floor location improved it and was appreciated. The location is at the edge of the Mag Mile and Gold Coast, close by the Water Tower and Hancock Tower (about 2 blocks) so it's easy to catch a bus. The Chicago Metra station is relatively close too. It's not as convenient as the Loop area if you're in town for the theater, but there are some fabulous restaurants nearby, such as the Grand Lux Cafe and Quartinos, which are both along E. Ontario St, as is Trader Joe's if you need some basic groceries. There is a Starbucks about 3 minutes walk away on Chestnut St closer to the Mag Mile. Across the street is an Ing Bank cafe --- I didn't buy anything there, but a lot of people were loading up on the inexpensive coffee and pastries there in the morning.Conclusion: this hotel is totally awesome. Stay here and you'll be spoiled for life for any other hotel with fewer amenities or luxuries."
8,244,"Oct 26 2009 	Great hotel...minor quibbles	This was my second stay at The Sofitel, the first being a one-night stay in late 2007. This time, I was there for five nights. I do love this hotel. But having become a connoisseur of hotels as of late, there are a couple of minor things that prevent me from giving the Sofitel Water Tower 5 stars. But let me start with the good stuff...* Super comfortable beds.* Great Bose alarm clock.* Robes and slippers provided.* Excellent gym for a hotel. People have noted that the gym is small...I've stayed in a lot of hotels and this was pretty good for a hotel gym. 6 of 7 treadmills. Three cross-trainers. At least one exercise bike. A lot of free weights and some weight machines. Also, the gym is free, unlike at the Sheraton where you have to pay.* Lovely little bar. Even when I lived in Chicago, I would come here for martinis and cocktails. I just really like the vibe.* Super clean. One thing I tend to notice is hotel wear and tear on walls and carpets. My room was pristine. The gym walls were pristine as well. Facilities is really doing their job here. * Great Aveda bath products.* Free coffee and croissants in the a.m. No one seems to mention this, but it's there in the cafe. (Unless I was supposed to pay and didn't realize it.) The first morning, I asked if they had any tea and they said yes, what kind. I asked for mint tea and a few minutes later they brought me my own pot of REAL FRESH mint tea. It was awesome. Good croissants too.* And lastly--and this might sound silly--but the baguettes at breakfast were fantastic. Because I live in London and spend a lot of time in France, I eat a lot of baguettes. The Sofitel's baguette at breakfast was amazingly crunchy on the outside, yet just the right amount soft on the inside. I had to ask if they make it themselves on site, and they do. So, the main thing that prevents this from being a slam-dunk for me is the lack of free wireless. Even if I had just gotten a free 10 hours or something, I would have given this five stars. But the fact that I had to buy the T-mobile package was really annoying. The other minor quibble was the consistency of housekeeping. One night, during the turndown service, they didn't leave me any bottled water. And during the regular morning service, one day, they forgot to replace my bath products so I didn't have any conditioner left. Also, I'm a sucker for when they lay out all your beauty products on a towel on the sink--I see that a lot at higher end hotels--and they didn't do that here. In short, this wasn't five-star housekeeping. Although it was good and very clean. So...you really can't go wrong here. My constructive comments are really aimed more at whoever is reading this at the hotel so they can kick things up a notch!"
9,244,"Oct 25 2009 	Experience it	There are times in ones life when we know an experience is extraordinary. My traveling companion and ventured to the Windy City for a weekend of entertainment, socializing and relaxation and I was impressed by the top shelf treatment we received at the Softiel Chicago Water Tower. The seamless transition beginning with curbside luggage service to prompt, courteous room service was executed by a staff well trained in hospitality.Hotel employees took a special interest in where we were from and our weekend plans. We especially remember Vera and Paula for being pleasant and helpful. In addition,Chef Martial Noguier prepared delectable off the menu vegetarian dishes to accommodate my dietary choices. When youre in Chicago, experience this."
10,244,"Oct 24 2009 	Lovely Place So-so Value	Here for five nights stay. The location is great on the upper end of Mag Mile but off the madness by two blocks, so nicely quiet. The building itself is impressive on outside, inside is interesting (but not as daring). Front desk staff pleasant, concierge staff helpful. We had a 16th floor room with great city view. Rooms still felt new to us and very clean. Bathroom was big and nice to have separate shower and tub (though not very deep). Housekeepers were always very friendly and tried very hard to please.It is a lovely place, but I will agree with a previous reviewer that I was expecting a bit more 'wow' I guess, based on all the glowing reviews here. I know hotels are especially expensive in larger cities, but I feel as though for the price the room was small, and how much contact does anyone really have with the staff anyway on average? Also have to pay for wifi; no pool. When we travel we're usually out almost all day and part of the night seeing the city/location anyway, so time spent in our room is usually minimal. Lesson learned...again. (FYI, I know the Drake and the Palmer House have lesser ratings, but their lobbies alone would be worth trying a stay it seemed.)"
11,244,"Oct 24 2009 	Great location	We stayed at the Sofitel for a weekend getaway. The primary reason we chose the Sofitel was its location, and it did not disappoint. Short walks to the Hancock building and Rush Street were just what we expected. The bell staff were also extremely courteous and helpful. Though a tad small, our room did have a good view, and the wifi connected easily. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was huge. It was also very quiet, which made sleeping easy. We would definitely stay here again, as this location is just hard to beat.The only negative we had was that we booked through Orbitz, and the staff did not have our reservation in the system when we checked in. They were able to quickly locate it, however, and to be fair, I had not confirmed the reservation prior to our arrival."
12,244,"Oct 19 2009 	Above all else fantastic staff!	A clean, modern hotel in a great location, good design, good food, good bars; all very well done. What marks this hotel out above others is the extreemly good level of service from all members of staff. The attentive yet discreet attentions of everyone I met was just right, something very few hotels seem to get right, well done Sofitel !"
13,244,"Oct 16 2009 	Cute Comfortable Cozy	This hotel is in a great location. Close to everything you would want to do downtown (Shopping, eating, sight seeing, etc.) The rooms are average in terms of design but they are new &amp; extremely clean. Wonderful bed. The front desk staff was extremely nice &amp; helpful. The lobby is beautiful and chic. The gym is small but adequate ( they provide complimentary refreshments, water and towels in the gym). The only CON about this hotel is that there was a dried of piece of chewing gum on the railing in one of the elevators and no refrigerators :("
14,244,"Oct 12 2009 	Deserves to be #1	I picked this hotel solely because it was #1 on Tripadvisor. I loved everything about it. The hotel is perfectly located at the beginning of the Magnificent Mile, about 2 blocks of. Very quiet. Genuine and friendly staff, very helpful. The beds are extremely comfortable, you don't want to leave them. The rooms are nicely equiped and super clean, including the bathrooms. I didn't eat there at all, I do think cereal and a banana for $10 is over the top, escpecially with all the great restaurants in the area. The gym is top-notch. Really enjoyed staying there. Would go back in a heartbeat."
15,244,"Oct 12 2009 	Great location friendly staff	Traveled for the weekend with 1yr old and spouse, and we had a great weekend trip! Location was great: close to shops, nice and casual restaurants, and easy to access the El or cab. Rooms had great bathrooms, were a bit small, but we also had a crib in there with us! Our son cried a bit before going to sleep (naps and nighttime), and when we were leaving the room once our neighbor was shocked we had a child in there...so walls must keep noises in neighboring rooms to a minimum!! Nice hotel bar, too!"
16,244,"Oct 11 2009 	Great hotel-even for babies	We stayed at this trendy French hotel for 2 nights with a baby in tow. We were intially conerned that it might not be family friendly. We were way off. The first thing that I noticed when we first got there was how incredibly friendly each and every staff member was to us-from the bellman to the extremely professional and customer service oriented front desk person-ours was named Steve. The hotel was busy during our stay as it was the Chicago Marathon weekend but though the lobby was buzzing with activity, service was unhindered. Our king room was on the 25 th floor-nice city view and had a beautiful marble bathroom and a super comfy bed. Not a huge room but that was ok as we could have upgraded to a larger one but didn;t want to. We had requested a crib and a fridge for the baby and they were sitting there when we walked in. Room was quiet and temperature control was perfect. For convenience we had pricey room service supper the first night and food was excellent and delivered hot. We also had 2 breakfasts at the cafe there and again though pricey it was excellent. Croissants and crepes were the real deal and the wait staff was friendly to our baby. So for us the customer service sold us on this hotel and we would recommend it."
17,244,"Oct 10 2009 	Fabulous view great beds wonderful bathroom	Boarded the train at Elmhurst (a local suburb)after a crazy night out with old friends and in a little under an hour we were in Chicago. The area outside the main train station is a little 'shady' but we were soon in a cab heading for Sofitel Water Tower. We've both stayed here before and its location is great for getting out and about. Five minutes from Michigan Avenue &amp; the main shopping area. We were greeted warmly by door-staff &amp; then reception who checked us in very quickly wishing us a pleasant stay. Unlike previous reviewers our experience at reception was good (maybe they've listened to feedback)?  After dropping off cases in room we headed straight to the Bar for one of the nicest smelling cosmopolitan's I've had, even the Monkeyboy said it smelt like perfume and it tasted great. I went to taste his beer but noticed glass was cracked. They replaced with apologies, it was an easy thing to miss but a nice touch would have been to comp the beer maybe? We sat by the window &amp; watched the comings and goings including a bride and the various guests dressed in their finery.  Room was great - when booking online we requested the highest room/best view and was given the 28th floor smack bang in front of John Hancock tower (visited 2008 -fab views from that room too!) room 2810 so I imagine all rooms ending in 10 would have similar views? Ice was available across the hall &amp; directly opposite the stairs/fire exit. Bathroom was lush - great mirror &amp; a magnifying mirror great for applying make-up. Slight grumble re lighting in shower as there isn't any but guess that's just poor planning. It's adequate re light from main area but could do with bit of extra light. Bed is so comfy we actually bought one based on a previous visit at a sofitel. This base was slightly softer but nevertheless linens are clean, white and very comfortable.  It's a bit noisy even this high up but mainly due to sirens etc and the A/C which switches on and off at intervals. However I always travel with earplugs so it's not an issue. Didn't hear any-one outside the room at any point.We ate breakfast in bed twice and had a great egg benedict, along with toast and muffin, the Monkeyboy had granola, yoghurt and fruit. Breakfast was served with a huge pot of coffee in a silver thermos so stayed hot and fresh for ages. All in all a great stay, highly recommend the hotel and can't wait for a return visit at some point."
18,244,"Oct 10 2009 	Great Stay at the Sofitel	Spent a 3 day weekend at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower and very much enjoyed it. The hotel is modern, the staff very welcoming and the location is outstanding. The hotel is very close to all the sights but since it is a block or so off Michigan Ave you don't walk out into a packed street. It's also close to the CTA and taxis queue right outside the front door making it very convenient to get around if you visiting places outside the downtown area. If you like to have wine &amp; snacks in the room (like I do) there's a market around the corner on State and a cute bakery on Delaware.The room was very comfortable with a good layout and enough space for 2 people. We were on the 16th floor looking east so there were no real landmarks in our view but a big view is nice to have no matter what. The amenities provided in the room were great. Enjoyed the use of the fluffy robe and slippers. My only disappointment was the bathtub which is very shallow and not what you would consider a &quot;soaking tub&quot;. But the shower was fantastic- great water pressure. I appreciated the turn down service which included a bottle of Evian.Didn't try the restaurant or room service since there are so many wonderful places to eat in Chicago!Great place to stay- comfortable, modern and stylish. Perfect location. Would definitely stay here again."
19,244,"Oct 8 2009 	Outstanding and Luxurious!	We went to visit our daughter who just moved to Chicago. The location was great, and the accomodations and service were superior. The bedding was wonderful !I would stay there again without hesitation!!We were treated like royalty."
20,244,"Oct 8 2009 	Great hotel - needs slight improvement on service	Great location in the middle of everything. Short distance to restaurant area, Hancock building, shopping, Watertower, Harbour area.Very stylish triangle building. Minimalistic, yet comfortable interior. One of the best workout rooms we have experienced in a hotel. Reception area an stair to second floor is a must-see.We had a Jr. suite, that were well equipped and roomy. Stylish interior, very comfy bed. Liked the electrically controlled curtains/blinds.Bar were and obviously a popular spot, also by Chicagoans.We would rated the hotel to a clear 5 if it had not been for the fact that some of the service were lacking. To explain a little: the bellboys were very good. The receptionist that checked us in were great, and the receptionist that checked us out was also very good. The room maid were very nice and did a really good job. The bar personell also performed a really good job and made us feel well taken care of.What made this be a 4-hotel instead of top score was; a mediocre concierge service, slow waiters during the breakfast and a very grumpy receptionist (despite the other to very good receptionist. Anyway, all in all a hotel we will return to."
21,244,"Oct 7 2009 	small rooms large bathroom good location very clean	Just returned from 3 nights at the Sofitel Water Tower. We thought that a Luxury room would be better than their standard when booking. We discovered that standard and luxury are the same except luxury is on the upper floors. We paid around $210/ night with pay 2 get 1 free deal through their website. The bed was comfortable with feather bed and down duvet, however, the 4 pillows had lumpy synthetic filler. They should have been down as well, especially at this price point. The travertine tile bathroom was large with high end bath products, robes, slippers, loofa, terry mits, nail buffers, cotton pads, q-tips, shower caps, hairdryer etc... The small room was the same size as the bathroom and included a king bed, desk, table with one chair, ironing board/iron and flat screen tv.We were on the 26th floor where our cell phones did not work well. So we had to go to the lobby or outside for full service each time we used our phones. They also claim to have wifi which is not correct since we couldn't find the connection. They do offer complementary access to 3 computers and printers on the second floor. However, it was occupied with conference people during the day. When we checked out, they told us that AT&amp;T service doesn't work well in the hotel and they were working on a solution. They also said to e-mail in advance next time we visit and they would put us in a larger room. Im not sure if this would really happen since I spoke to someone at the front desk about it the day we arrived after seeing the room. Even though we are new A-club members and they said that we would need to pay to upgrade to a larger room. They give complementary upgrades to upper level members.Staff was very friendly, except Shae from the concierge made me feel like we were bothering her with questionsisnt that her job?.a smile would have been nice too. Umbrellas by the doors came in very handy with the unpredictable weather. And they get an A+ for cleanliness.Overall, I'm not sure if I would return."
22,244,"Oct 5 2009 	Enjoyed our stay	While this hotel is very stylish, the staff great, and the location wonderful, I have a hard time believing this hotel should be number one in Chicago. I all comes down to the rooms and the decoration, styling, and size of the 'junior suites' left a lot to be desired. Though the bathroom was spacious, the shower stall was hardly big enough for my 6'1, 175lb frame, and the tub offered little relief. The color scheme and furniture also seemed a bit out of place. It felt more like an episode of 'Trading Spaces' than a french style luxury hotel. Plus some furnishings were starting to show wear. Maybe I just got a bad room, because everything else about the hotel was great. Valet was gracious without being snooty, front desk staff was friendly and gave no impression that I shouldn't be wearing an t-shirt and jeans to check into their hotel. The bar is just as cool as it look in pictures, but I am a bit puzzled as to why they would put it on the ground floor when most of the other hotels in the class had bars on the top floors.The Hancock building was a quick stroll away as was the Miracle Mile, but there was plenty of good eating and bars in the area. We enjoyed Pippen for some post exploration beers and Fiest for lunch. I think I might try something else for my next trip to Chicago, but this was still a nice place to stay for a long weekend of fun and live music from America's last surviving grunge rock band."
23,244,"Sep 29 2009 	Relaxing and Enjoyable Stay	We stayed for 4 nights in a suite ( excellent rate through expedia). The rooms size and layout were excellent with my only reservation being the furniture was starting to show a fair amount of wear and tear ( unusual for a Sofitel). The locatiion was very convenient for shopping and restaurants in the area are plentiful. The Tempo Cafe next door is excellent for breakfast. The service and staff at the hotel were first rate. Very quiet rooms with usual excellent bed. No paper at your door and no in room coffee available , which would have been nice. The fitness centre isn't much."
24,244,"Sep 29 2009 	(shrugs shoulders) It was perfectly okay	Great location for shopping Michigan Ave. Staff was friendly enough. Concierge made a great recommadation for dinner near Briar Street Theatre (Blue Man Group). The hotel was perfectly......okay. Awesome bed......... Upgraded room was a disappointment. 30 floors up with a view of the high rise condo next to you. I watched a hung over, rich guy smoke on his balcony in his tighty whities at 9 AM on Sunday morning. I paid extra money for that priviledge....although that was not the hotel's fault that he couldn't put on some clothes.Had to pay extra money for internet access in the room. Price for internet, room service continental breakfast, and parking................410$......nice hotel......but not great for the amount of money I spent."
25,244,"Sep 23 2009 	Excellent Location for sightseeing in Chicago	Sofitel Water Tower Hotel in Chicago is certainly in the heart of the city. We stayed there for 3 nights at the end of August whilst visiting a friend also. We picked the hotel as a result of the strong positive reviews on Trip Advisor and it was No 1 on the site also.It is certainly a very nice hotel, not as wow as I was expecting but I was not disappointed with it as an experience. We had our room upgraded on arrival as a result of our friend chatting to the concierge while we were checking in and it cost us about an extra $100 in total for the 3 nights. We ended up with a suite which consisted of a large bedroom, king bed, flat screen TV and wardrobes. Sitting room leading off the bedroom had double doors and it had desk, couches and another flat screen tv. Bathroom had double sinks, large shower and Jacuzzi bath with toilet.Room was nice and quiet and you would not hear a lot going on outside at all. Beds were definitely very soft and after 3 nights we were struggling with our backs as we are used to a hard bed at home!We did not eat or drink in the hotel during our stay as our friend collected us each day and we did not spend a lot of time in the room as a result.We used the gym on two occasions, and it is small but has everything you might possibly need (fresh fruit and water available for guests).My only disappointment is the views, no matter which floor you are on, you can only see other buildings around you, we were looking into a block of flats and could see right into the bedrooms and dining rooms etc, not the hotels fault but am sure some of the other hotels have better views if that is what you are after.The staff all appeared to be friendly and courteous, room service was good and could not fault it as a location. Walking distance to anywhere you might want to go in centre of Chicago. Booked the room directly on the hotel website as it was the cheapest of all the websites offering the hotel rooms. If I was travelling back to Chicago would stay there again."
26,244,"Sep 18 2009 	Excellent hotel and location	After extensive internet research (particularly trip advisor reviews) and assistance from family living near Chicago, we d Don't worry - as soon as you sign  ecided on staying at the Sofitel Water Tower hotel. We were not disappointed! Extremely well appointed rooms and very comfortable beds. The concierge staff were very helpful and produced 'direction cards' upon request to all of the major Chicago sites. The location is excellent - near enough to the Magnificent Mile, but set back in a quiet area. My only (minor) complaint would be the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the room. Excellent breakfasts available at the Tempo cafe which is virtually next to the hotel"
27,244,"Sep 13 2009 	Probably a good business choice	But on a holiday wearing shorts and sneakers we felt we were not welcome. We felt it a pretentious business hotel. After almost 3 weeks of travelling, we choose this hotel from its ratings to end our trip in style. Got a great rate and was looking forward to our stay, and the room was great. After 3 weeks with free internet at even the most mediocre hotels, it is a change that you now are charged USD 10 if you need to go on-line, we had forgotten that when on a business trip, you have to pay extra no matter what you need.We had booked and paid room and breakfast in advance and gotten an email confirmation. When checking out, I was informed that this was not registred in their systems. They could not solve the problem on the spot and all they could suggest was for us to sent an email. We did and problem was eventually solved. But the feeling of distrust and the fact that it was I who had to prove their systems was malfunctioning, made me fell uneasy."
28,244,"Sep 12 2009 	Staffing issues let this place down	To start with the positives: - Good value for the quality of the room and location, which is excellent for a short stay - Room very well furnished and well decorated, with great views from a higher floor (and I think the views lower down would probably also be not half bad) - Everything clean enough, although bath had some rather odd scratches and the sink overflow could do with a deep clean, there were a few black stains visible when I bent down towards it whilst brushing my teeth. - Soap appeared to be vegetarian (although no way of knowing with the shampoo and shower gels, which wasnt so good  vegetarian guests want to know that kind of information)- Clear emergency exit signs, and checking the fire exit I found it was completely clear and I had confidence that the place was safe, with a smoke detector and I think a fire suppressor (sprinkler) in the room- Very quiet, with no noise disturbance from other rooms, the corridor or outsideGood quality flat screen tv able to accept HD television, with a good range of channels including HD- Excellent air conditioning  could go cool without becoming too noisy- Free and very rapid internet / printer in the business centre, good quality machine and screen, and clean keyboard and mouse- Allowed early check-in, as the room was already open  which I thought was great, although obviously that is just luck - A highly professional manager who sorted out some serious problems that arose during my stay.So, with such a lot going for it, it is a pity to report that there were some negatives that badly spoiled my visit.A few minor negatives to start with - No kettle, tea or coffee  its too posh for that, which I find annoying and pretentious. Waking up early I like a cup of coffee before I dress and leave to face the world (and that includes going to a hotel dining room) - its poor that some hotels (generally better ones) consider that too common for them. When Ive asked, Ive been brought a cafitierre and kettle before in better hotels than this, but given the level of comprehension and friendliness I'd encountered at check-in I didnt fancy my chances so didnt bother asking. - A minifridge you cant put your own water in, because its one of those spring-loaded things that automatically bills you if you even move one of the bottles already in there. Annoying, but as noted in the positives, the ac was good. - Slightly soft bed with only feather mattress and pillows  I prefer non-animal bedding products but this isnt an option. And then the real problem, which is the reception and concierge staff.- Check-in was about as limp as Ive encountered. She struggled with my fairly simple English surname, and hadnt been taught to repeat letters spoken to you, so it took longer than it should for her to understand my fairly simple surname. A E? No A, for Adam E? No A,.. Painful, and heaven help people with less common surnames. I suspected she was French, as the A/E thing can happen with native French speakers and my French is awful so I'm not being anti-French. No welcome, no explanation of any facilities (are there any? After leaving I heard there is a fitness centre, but wasnt told so wasnt aware of it), and she was already walking away when I got to ask a question is breakfast included in my rate, which met with a simple no  not a No, but you can buy it.or no, but there are nice cafes nearby, just no., and she was gone, so lucky I didnt have any more questions. I dont like gushing welcomes, but basic hospitality is important and it was absent. - Checking out I asked for directions by public transport to the airport. The receptionist informed me that was no public transport available, the only way to get to the airport was by taxi, it cost about fifty bucks, and I could get one from outside. I explained that I prefer not to travel in motor cars / automobiles (no good reason  I just dont like them) and had never been to a big city airport that couldnt be accessed by public transport of some form, be it a train or a bus (I'd arrived in Chicago by train, my first visit there, so it was a genuine question I needed an answer to). Again he insisted it just wasnt possible. I said I found that simply incredible and said would go to the internet machine nearby and find the route myself, at which point he went to confer with a colleague and returned with a nicely printed out direction card for the simple, cheap ($2.25) and quick (1 hour door to door) route from the hotel to OHare via the metro. No Ive just learned something or sense that hed learned anything that would help him serve future customers, just the same blank, limp, half-baked, cant give a damn attitude Id already encountered there.I wanted to pay cash (gives me a better exchange rate) and that request was met as though Id said something a bit weird. Ive paid cash in other American hotels, no issue at all, but to this person it seemed odd. He went to check that it was okay, and I was transferred to another staff member who took my money. She was the same as the others - no engagement, no energy, no understanding that transactions can be courteous and friendly and dont have to be monosyballic and no-eye-contact- got-over-with-as-soon-as-possible affairs. That was the tone throughout the hotel. As I say, Im personally not hugely into excessive friendliness or fakeness, but the staff at this hotel are on the wrong side of the line and I felt they didnt actually understand that I was a paying guest who happened to be paying their salary for the time they were dealing with me. It may be they are all new and inexperienced and just lacking in confidence dealing with foreigners, but if that is the case they need some training. It got worse, although I only found out after checking out. My brother, who couldnt contact me by cell but was planning to check into a nearby hotel with friends, had arranged to call me so we could meet up for dinner  wed not seen each other for a long time. He called the hotel only to be told I was not staying there  I was actually waiting in my room for his call and stayed in, checking for messages! He repeated my surname several times (he found that they don't know the basic technique of repeating each letter to confirm if its mutually understood - he speaks very clear south of England English, as do I, so it's not as though we have heavily accented English that could have thrown them). He then asked if they would do a search on my first name, as there couldnt be that many people of that name staying. He was transferred now to the front desk, who simply declined to search by first name, in a sort of Sorry, cant help limp kind of way, which reminded me, when I was told about it, by the half-baked way I was originally greeted when I checked-in. So he thought Id not checked-in and was worried about where I was. We met up the next day as I tracked down his hotel via a friend so we did get to meet up, but Id missed the dinner the previous evening and one friend I didnt get to see as hed left town in the morning. I returned (I had to collect my bag from the concierge en route to the airport) and asked the concierge if I could see the duty manager (it was early evening, and I didnt expect the hotel manager necessarily to be there). Duty manager? he said incredulously, as if hed never heard such a term and needed it explaining. Yes, the manager who is on duty. Oh, do you have an appointment? No, I have a complaint  do I need an appointment to make a complaint? He is over there (he pointed to the guy near him on reception). Appointment indeed! What absolutely second-rate impertinence. The manager couldnt find any record of my stay on their system, and it was only when I produced my receipt that he explained what the problem was  Id been booked in, unbeknown to me, with my surname and first name reversed. He said that should have been sorted at check-in. He agreed, however, that this didnt explain why his staff had declined to search for me by first name as well as second name when asked to do so by my brother. I complained to him not just about this, but the general poor quality of reception and concierge service I had received  one of them was standing nearby and was literally gawping at me as I spoke to the manager, too poorly trained to understand that this type of audience can only exacerbate a difficult conversation. Professional front desk staff know how to behave and with the exception of the manager the people at that front-desk didnt have a clue. The manager recovered the situation with a fulsome apology, and, I have to hope, an understanding that he needed to sort out some staffing issues. He made a courtesy reduction on my bill which made me feel his apology was a sincere one and this retrieved the situation so Id consider staying at the chain again  I explained to him Ive stayed in other accor and Sofitel hotels outside the US and always experienced good service in the past. So I dont feel as if I can actually recommend this hotel at the moment. I am returning to Chicago next year and I'd like to stay, but I'd want to know the staffing situation had been sorted out. Currently, there are staff who dont know that they should know the names of their guests, that they should be prepared to look at a simple list to locate a guest when someone wishes to speak to them; they dont know that they shouldnt be phased when someone wants to pay in cash; they dont know that part of their job is to briefly summarise available facilities; they dont know that it is provocative to ask a customer with a complaint if they have an appointment to speak to the manager who is on duty a few feet away; they dont know that there is a metro to the airport and that it is wrong to insist that you can only there by taxi. This catalogue of half-baked, rude and ridiculous incidents involves several staff, not just one, so I think its a total culture change they need  if I was a high-up person with accor I'd consider closing the place for a week and training up new staff. I would repeat, however, that the manager was professional and courteous and did apologise for the errors, so there has to be some hope there I suppose."
29,244,"Sep 12 2009 	Brilliant	Was really surprised with this hotel.Great experience, will return!!"
30,244,"Sep 9 2009 	Quiet Retreat in the Heart of Everything	We stayed for 4 nights at the Sofitel, and I cannot say enough good things about it. I read a lot of reviews of a lot of hotels in Chicago before making a selection, and had not been in Chicago in 8 years, so I didn't know quite what to expect. This is the top tier of 4-star hotels. The location is superb: 2 blocks from the red line, 1 block off Mag Mile (not on it!), and walking distance to everything. Bus to Boystown (#36) is 1/2 block away on State Street. I was greeted on my very late arrival by a very friendly and accommodating front desk staff who happily granted my request for an upper-floor room. The lobby of the hotel is dark and very soothing; like walking into a calm retreat. The halls of the guest rooms are also darker toned. I never saw a maid's cart except my last day, when I was checking out late; I dont know how they do that. Every staff member was so polite and courteous, from the concierge on down. Housekeeping was excellent. I got a refrigerator in my room at no extra charge. The bathroom is spotless and very spacious, with a nice corner glass shower. There is EXTRA ample storage space for clothes and shoes in both the closets and dressers--unusual these days! Best of all, the room was extremely quiet and the bed was a dream, and I am very picky about those things. Special kudos to the very busy concierge who nonetheless gave me knock-out directions to everything I needed (I dont remember her name, but she was working Friday 9/5/09 late morning). Ok, if I had to say something negative, it is that the 'gym' is about the size of a broom closet, but I have very low expectations of gyms in hotels, so it is par for the course. Also, it is a shame that this and all 'luxury' hotels charge for wireless. Come on! It's just a pain to go across the street and get it for free, but that I did."
31,244,"Sep 8 2009 	Elegance and Style	I have stayed here several times, usually weekends with my spouse. This place is my favorite in Chicago. Well appointed rooms, impeccable service, fantastic location. While its not the newest of the luxury hotels in Chicago (think trump ) it by far is the best in overall service. My room ws higher up, city view - definite plus if you can get it - try the breakfast with french pressed coffee - wonderful. Close to many decent restaurants, Tavern on Rush, Carmines just to name a few - and excellent shopping. Everything very clean and nice ammenities. Bar is friendly and accomodating, but also more on the elegant side - a great spot to start a special night out."
32,244,"Sep 1 2009 	Nicely located well appointed great staff!	I was lucky enough to be taken here for a 50th Birthday treat, whilst I wouldn't go as far to say it is a luxury hotel it is 'very' nice. Very well appointed and tastefully decorated The staff are great, nothing is too much trouble, all extremely polite. As it was my birthday I had a lovely chocolate dessert brought to the room, scrumptious!We stayed in a Superior King Size room on the 8th floor and had a great view of the Hancock Tower, but not much else. You are within two blocks of the main shopping area, the Magnificent Mile. Easy to find your way around and plenty of shops, eating houses nearby. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on that but the restaurant and bar area looked really nice.The gym is a bit of a let down, modern machines but the actual exercise area is far too small.Would I stay there again? Absolutely!"
33,244,"Sep 1 2009 	My kinda town..	Chicago is an amazing city- friendlier than NY, cheaper and just as spectacular. The Sofitel chain is pretty impressive and the Chicago one is great. Excellent location, funky but not pretentious lobby, laid back and casual vibe. We were in shorts and Ts all holiday and no one questioned us once or asked to see our room key.Room was great although a higher floor would have been better but it was a busy weekend and we booked late.The concierge staff were extremely professional and knowledgable - booking us a table at a fashionable local restaurant.We skipped food in the hotel as the choice of dining in the city is amazing. Best for breakfast is Tempo a 24hr diner just round the corner. Get there early though if you don't want to queue.Highlights of the trip include the skyscraper walk, the science museum and the Art Institute. We also went out to Wrigleyville- not to catch a game but to soak up the great atmosphere and try the best ribs ever in the Sheffield Bar micro brewery. I would never have guessed that Chigago would have so many great local artisan beers on offer."
34,244,"Aug 31 2009 	Couldn't Be Better	Sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel, even if you tried. Such was the case with Sofitel, where we'd never stayed before. It's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with European touches. We spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. The room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. The public areas were wonderfully decorated. The restaurant served a good breakfast at, for Chicago, reasonable prices. The staff was excellent. My wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. The staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her."
35,244,"Aug 31 2009 	Excellent	Stayed 3 nights in July and could not have been more satisfied. Excellent location just a short walk from Michigan Avenue, trendy design and great service. The spacious corner rooms are highly recommended. Will definitely stay here again."
36,244,"Aug 29 2009 	Convenient location friendly staffs but bed was toooo soft	Sofitel is very conveniently located just a couple blocks from michigan avenue. The staffs were very polite and friendly. This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel but I would give a 3.5. I wasn't too impressed with the decoration and quality of furniture. And it was too dark. I found a deal online so overall it was pretty good for the money. However, I am not sure if I would come back for a regular rate. The only problem I had was the bed. I use a firm mattress at home and the bed was way too soft and I had a back pain. Oh, the room was a bit too small but i liked the L'OCCITANE bathroom products."
37,244,"Aug 29 2009 	Good Choice for solid Chicago Hotel	This Dentist from Denver spent a great weekend in Chicago at the Water Tower. It has a perfect location, and the price was good at $177 a night. Decorations were modern, my wife raved about the bathroom and the service was solid. We had a wonderful stay."
38,244,"Aug 29 2009 	Decent Hotel in the middle of Chicago	Great Location in Chicago, just a minutes away from the John Hancock center.We had a lake view room, but even in the 19th floor you hardly can see it. The room was clean and luxurious but not too spacey. Really nice equipment in the room.For parking do not use the Valet service of the hotel, as it is 47$ for 24h. If you do not need your car every hour use the 900 North Michigan parking garage for 34$ for 24h."
39,244,"Aug 28 2009 	Awasome Hotel.........	Fom the moment we arrived on Thursday until checkout day Monday, the staff members at the Sofitel Chicago Tower made us felt very special. I couldn't have picked a better Hotel in Chicago to Celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The room was absolutely incredible ultra modern and luxury, very spacious, spotless, great amenities, the bed was SO comfortable, the gym is small but have the perfect equipment to do a great vacation workout. A special shout out to the entire staff who could not have been more accommodating. Thank you very much for made our stayed in Chicago the best and we would definitely stay there again. MM"
40,244,"Aug 26 2009 	Great Chicago Hotel	Stayed here for the first time about a month ago. I highly recommend this hotel. Three things I look for in a hotel while traveling is clean rooms, comfortable beds, and easy access to surrounding attractions. This hotel has all three and a beautiful bathroom. I actually booked this hotel for our October visit and not the normal hotel I would normally stay at in Chicago."
41,244,"Aug 26 2009 	Awesome location awesome hotel	I stayed for four nights while attending a conference. The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St., but just off the busy streets. The room I had was spacious, and very well-appointed. The staff was friendly, and the fitness center, while not huge, was well-equipped and clean. I've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago, and this one is my favorite. Internet wasn't free, but at $10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels, and it worked very well."
42,244,"Aug 25 2009 	Fabulous Accomodations	We stayed 3 nights in a Prestige suite at an advertised rate of $254.00 per night. The suite was beautiful and spacious with flat screen TVs in both the bedroom and living area. Bathroom was large. Everything was immaculately clean. The bed was soft and comfortable with down pillows or you could get other pillows if you are allergic to down. We had no problems sleeping as we do in some hotel beds. The hotel is very contemporary and our only complaint is that the couch in the living area was not very comfortable for reading the morning paper or unwinding after sightseeing. We had one meal in the restaurant - dinner - and the food was excellent. We got the fixed price dinner that included dessert, but we had to leave for the theatre without it. The wait staff told us to defintely stop in after the show because they would be opened late and we could have our dessert then. That's exactly what we did and they greeted us warmly and made us feel very special and not as if we were imposing for coming back. We used the concierge twice, spoke once to housekeeping, and used the doorman for taxis many times. We had a car one day/night from Enterprise (next door to the hotel) which made it convenient. The hotel overnight parking is very expensive but we had no wait for the car when we needed it. Everyone was always friendly and accomodating. It was our first stay at a Sofitel, but it will not be our last."
43,244,"Aug 19 2009 	Excellent as usual-one gripe!	I am a retired London cop and holiday every 2 years with my wife, but we try and do it in as much style and comfort as we can. I have found that booking a suite in a Sofitel is not cheap, especially bearing in mind that we used to spend $40 per night for a motel room when travelling with the kids. However returning to a Sofitel suite after a hard days sightseing is an absolute pleasure. Their beds really are like marshmallows.The Water Tower Suite was much larger than our New York Suite and a real thrill. 17 floors up with glass walls was a bit of an eye opener for this Brit. The lounge was large with 2 couches, desk and a large 40&quot; widescreen Plasma, mini bar, and footstools. The bathroom was my wifes favourite, separate bath, shower and WC, glass doored inside, with all amenities. When I rang housekeeping about our hairdryer a new one was brought within 10 minutes. We took advice from trip advisor members and avoided an apparently expensive hotel breakfast instead grabbing a bagel etc nearby. We used 'Tempo', almost next door, once for breakfast but found ther portions just too big to handle and a bit of a waste of money for the average UK appetite. We ate at the hotel on our last morning and wished we had eaten there more often, especially the basket of pastries. I urge you to eat there early in your stay, I wish I had. Buy a 'Go Chicago' Card for at least 5 days, excellent value. Use the Italian restaurant on Main St, opposite 'Chilis' its cheap and magnificent.My only complaint about the Sofitel , and I raised it with them so have no qualms about listing it here, is that they expected me to pay for Wi Fi even when paying $300 per night for a room! Get real! For the cost of a cup of coffee I could go to the ING Cafe across the road or Starbucks around the corner and get it for free! It's time premium hotels started to be realistic about this, and to be honest it left me with a bad taste in my mouth that after taking $300 per night, excluding breakfast, they would hook up with a service provider and try for another $7.50 per day.In conclusion the room was great, the location was excellent, use the Chicago Card, do the walking tour for the architecture, visit the Frank Lloyd Wiright studio and tour and you'll relish your time in Chicago. I know we would love to return and stay at the Sofitel.RegardsPHIL KING"
44,244,Aug 19 2009 	The best in Chicago	The service is really something in this place! After reading the reviews we decided to stay here and we don't regret. Overall is a bit pricy but it worth it.The restaurant is great and we saw the Chef himself which is a celebrety in town.Pizano's right on the corner is a great restaurant as well.I'll be back for sure!!!!
45,244,"Aug 18 2009 	Fantastic stay	My partner and I stayed here, because people were staying at our condo who were in town for our wedding. We were upgraded to a suite and received strawberries and wine, an hour after check in (compliments of the hotel). Ellen, who worked the front desk was so wonderful, as well as the rest of the staff for our 4 night stay. Everything about the hotel was first class- almost makes me not want to write a review, so that I can keep this hotel all to myself :)"
46,244,"Aug 16 2009 	Excellent excellent excellent!	Stayed here for 2 nights in November, and had a great day. The decor is stylish throughout, the rooms are large, comfortable and tastefully decorated. The staff are helpful and the location was great. Would definitely stay here again."
47,244,"Aug 15 2009 	Amazing!!	I recently stayed @ The Sofitel, Chicago Watertower on 06 August 2009 for 1 night. I was originally booked at The Dana Hotel, but the hotel ended up being TERRIBLE, so I Checked out of the hotel immediately &amp; moved to the Sofitel. Upon arrival, I wanted to see what the room would look like &amp; Jeffrey at the Front Desk was incredibly polite &amp; offered to show me the room----Mandy was also great @ the front desk--The Room was beautiful, (#2816) with a slight view of the lake--AMAZING bed, great room service, L'Occitane en Provence bath amenities, LOOFAH in the tub (the hot water did take a couple of minutes to get really hot, but this wasn't a problem)---Very quiet room, perfect A/C, etc. The Concierge (Justin) was really great---super friendly! The location is really great (5 min. walk from MICHIGAN ave. shops, tons of restaurants, etc.), but the people working there were really nice----they were aware of my bad expereince at the Dana &amp; cared that I was at the hotel---even the bartenders were so nice----Jeffrey at the front desk was the best, as well as Justin --Jeffrey asked how everything was &amp; seemed concered to make sure everything was good----The lobby was really cool &amp; the Floral arrangement were stunning--really creative &amp; Avante Garde displays......Great Hotel &amp; I would def. return upon my next visit to Chicago, which is an AMAZING CITY!!!!!Safe Travels,Best,Patrick W.NYC15th Aug."
48,244,"Aug 15 2009 	big league hotel	we were in chicago for four days to catch the Phillies and Cubbies. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor we booked a room at the Sofitel. This turned out to be a great move. This hotel has it all. It's super clean, has a nice location, and the staff could not be better, As others have stated, the rooms are fairly large and have large, well lighted bathrooms. A flat screen TV gets about sixty channels and the bed could not be more comfortable. The concierge was friendly, informitive and very helpful, as was the desk clerk. The staff at the hotel bar was outstanding. The hotel provides free coffee and newspaper in the morning. We ate breakfast at the hotel and it was perfect. There are many nearby restaurants from which to chooze. We liiked Mike Ditkas, located about one block from the hotel. We stumbled onto this place after going to McCormick and Schmicks for an afternoon drink and running into the worst bartender in the universe. We sat at a nearly empty bar for twenty minutes with this boozo looking at everything but us. When we got up to leave this said I'll be with you in a minute. I will never go to another M &amp; S again. Anyway we then went to Ditkas, where the bartender was fine. This was our kind of bar and we ate two dinners there which were excellent. Chicago is a fun city and although we had been there before the Sofitel and Ditkas made this trip A-one. (plus the phillies cleaned the cubs clock). Although we took the El to Wrigley we did use cabs at other times. The Chicago cab drivers must train at Indy. I thought the cops were chasing us a few times. They were good but fast. Should I live long enough and return to Chicago I would stay at the Sofitel."
49,244,"Aug 12 2009 	Great stay!	My 15-year-old daughter and I went to Chicago for a 2-day shopping spree. This hotel was awesome! It is about a block away from the Magnificent Mile. We walked all over the place. The beach on Lake Michigan was a 10 minute walk. The location is fabulous. I emailed the hotel a week or so ahead and told them it was a special trip for my daughter. The hotel sent up a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries on our first night. My daughter thought that was really cool. The staff bends over backwards to help you. We used the valet parking (which was $47/day), but it was worth it! The bathroom is huge and all marble. The beds are super comfortable with feather-top mattresses and down comforters. The view was beautiful (looking down on an old seminary), especially at night. One thing I didn't know - if you don't request top sheets, you won't get them. We asked when we realized we didn't have them, and someone from housekeeping brought them up right away and even put them on the beds. Great stay at a great hotel!!! We would definitely go back. Two things I would have liked - a coffee pot in the room or free coffee somewhere, and free internet. Those are the only 2 things I would change. :-)"
50,244,"Aug 12 2009 	Wow... Haven't been pampered like this in a while	Truly amazing hotel - expensive but worth it. Hotel is gorgeous, room is fantastic and the bathroom left me quite spolied. Great location, 5 minute walk to the Magnificent Mile right at the John Hancock building. Service is impeccable, I especially liked the fact that when it rained the bellman offered you an umbrella when leaving the hotel, this was a nice touch. It's never fun to be away on business, and this was the first time I would have been happy to stay longer! Food was also incredible - be sure to splurge and be prepared to be spoiled!"
51,244,"Aug 11 2009 	Good overall stay	I typically stay in 4 or 5 star hotels around the world and I am familar with the Sofitel brand from Europe and Asia.Good points:- Location - just a few moments from Michigan Ave- Rooms - clean, good amenities and all you would expect from a 4 / 5 star hotel- Business centre - 3 computers to use (although very busy during the day)- Gym - small but usable with fresh fruit and water machine- Chic Picnic - Got this package which gave us a picnic with the stay. It rained on the day we had booked and they were kind enough to take back the basket and restock with fresh food the next dayBad points:- Check-in - slight confusion with my booking at check in - I was on the chic picnic package but their system did not show this. However, it was sorted out in the end- Loyalty perks - I am a platinum (top tier) a-club member but did not get any benefits. Free upgrade (subject to availability) was apparently not available. Requested my free 'gift' on arrival which I qualify for, was promised something but did not receive anything- Bed - far too soft. Not good if you need support or partaking in other 'activity'!Tips- Booked on hotels.com and got a very good rate - book in advance - Got to the restaurant next to the hotel for bfast (out the door and turn right) - get there early though as queue build- If going to Lincoln park don't bother with a taxi, the bus from Mich. Ave goes straight there- Take a Chicago food tour- Book lunch in the John Hancock tower instead of paying to go up. Avoid the buffet though-"
52,244,Aug 11 2009 	Loved the Sofitel Experience!	We had the pleasure of spending 6 nights at the Sofitel. All I can say is it exceeded our expectation! The staff are so pleasant and helpful. We celebrated our anniversary during our stay and they left chocolate-dipped strawberries in our room while we were out....plus an incredible picnic basket. Can't wait to stay here again! The location is fantastic too!
53,244,"Aug 11 2009 	Sophisticated great value superb location - Chicago personified	We booked a nonrefundable deal with the hotel direct and got a great rate on a junior suite.The rooms are very well equipped and modern, with far more space than I have experienced at other, more expensive alternatives. Staff were very helpful indeed and the restaurant and bar are destinations in their own right.The location is spot on, only a short walk from Michigan Avenue shopping and within easy reach of all the sights and nightspots.All in all one of the most successful choices in many years of travelling. Also the first hotel I have stayed in that I felt compelled to review!"
54,244,Aug 10 2009 	The double beds are horrible	My wife and two children stayed at the water tower with a great three day rate. The room was a bit small but overall all right. The beds however were REALLY BAD. After one night of sleeping slanted to the right and almost rolling off and not sleeping at all I told the front office staff. They showed up with five people to &quot;inspect the so called lopsided bed&quot;. After they saw the bed and my wife's bed was just as bad they moved us to another room on the top floor (which was nice). We received the same type of beds (cruddy) but not lopsided anymore. Completed an on-line survey and they said they &quot;apologize&quot; for the poor beds. Only reason I would recommend is for location to Chicago red line and public transportation and the thinking that their King beds would be better.
55,244,"Aug 9 2009 	Very comfortable and great location	I stayed for 3 nights for business and found that the hotel lived up to its top rating. It was very posh, had 24 hour fitness center, good ambiance, good location and top notch staff. My only complaint was on the desk chair. While beautiful and nice to look at, it's not quite functional and much too low for the table to actually do work. I had to use the lounge chair which wasn't as comfortable to work. Otherwise everything was perfect."
56,244,"Aug 9 2009 	Fabulous friendly French	This was our second stay here over the past couple years. Thanks to QuickBook, we managed a terrific deal on the room (about 35% of the list price). We stayed in a &quot;Superior&quot; Room, which while a bit small, was more than comfortable enough. The room was very clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable. What stood out, though, was the friendliness and attention to service provided by every single employee. It seemed like they went out of their way to make sure our stay was memorable. Great look, great location."
57,244,"Aug 5 2009 	Great location clean great service	flew in for 1 night for a business meeting.faultless, great location only a few minutes from Michigan Avenue. Great staff, great bed."
58,244,"Aug 5 2009 	Comfort and service extraordinaire.	My husband and I enjoy time away from home to relax, sleep, eat and sightsee so Sofitel Water Tower with a view of the Hancock Tower was a good choice. Our king bed was super comfy and the housekeeping staff actually heeded the 'Do Not Disturb' sign outside. Bathroom was enormous with a beautiful shower and tub. Robes, slippers, mini-bar are high quality and the room service was also quick and well done. (Morning french press coffee is superb.) Service means something here. I forgot my BB charger in the room. A call and it was couriered, actually beating me back home."
59,244,"Aug 4 2009 	Nice hotel	We paid $305/night and i think it was worth. Great location, great rooms, the view was ok (not wow), room was clean and modern, spotless bath, beds were SUPER. Nothing excessive though, so I would not pay more than this price. We haven't used the gym or pool but they look small in pictures. $50 valet parking... I guess $305 is the Maximum I would pay for this hotel. DO NOT go to Tomo's cafe next corner, like one review here recommended, Lousy place!"
60,244,"Aug 3 2009 	Great Location Not worth the hype	Furnishings a little shabby, lobby is chic. Service was a bit condescending. We were there for our honeymoon and they brought champagne up, didn't knock and just came into our room, where we were in bed. I complained to management and was offered an apology, but not a very heartfelt one."
61,244,"Aug 3 2009 	Great weekend stay at the Sofitel!	I had the pleasure of spending the weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Sofitel. Everything was great! After check in, I was upgraded to a lake view room on the 28th floor after utilizing my A club card. If you don't have one, I would highly recommend applying. It's free. I had brunch on Saturday and Sunday at the hotel restaurant and it was excellent. They never disappoint :) A+"
62,244,"Jul 31 2009 	Wow! Great stay....	I have stayed at a bunch of Chicago hotels over the last year and I have to say that this one had it all. I got a rate of about $200 on Hotels.com for a Monday night. I asked for a room with a nice view. They gave me a beautiful room on the 31st (it might have been 30th?) floor that looked directly out at the Hancock Tower and had a lot of filtered views of the lake! The view was unbelievable! On my most recent stay I was at the Knickerbocker (about two blocks away) and while the rooms were nicely appointed, the Airconditioning was horrible and the rooms only looked out at what I believe was the Westin. No views at all. The staff at the Sofitel really stand out. They were eager to please and very polite. The rooms were spotless, the A/C worked great, the bathroom was modern and wonderful. I usually have complaints at hotels and I can honestly say that I had a great and carefree stay at this hotel. I can't point to anything that wasn't perfect. Keep in mind, I'm not saying that this is a Four Seasons but its not priced as a Four Seasons. This place is WAY better than the Knickerbocker, The W, The Hardrock, The Westin, The Affinia etc. This is in a class of its own in comparison to those hotels.It also has a great location.You won't be disappointed! This was a nice surprise."
63,244,Jul 26 2009 	Couldn't have been better	We spent 3 nights at the Water Tower and had the best time ever. We had already been to Chicago before but the concierge was excellent and found great activities for us as well as recommending restaurants and making reservations. Great service...The hotel itself is beautiful and stylish and comfortable with amazing views. We use Sofitel a lot but this is probably one of the very best ones we have stayed at. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
64,244,"Jul 26 2009 	Great location rooms a bit disappointing	We have stayed at other Sofitels and found the rooms at this one a bit disappointing. I confess, I was surprised after all the rave reviews on the site. There was nothing actually wrong with the room at all, but it seemed a bit dated in comparison with the rest of the hotel. The lobby bar and public areas are all really funky but the rooms seemed fairly bland in comparison. Having said that, despite the styling issues, the room was very comfortable, had a great view and was quiet. The bathrooms were lovely - as usual for a sofitel! The breakfast room seemed very small for the size of the hotel and on one morning there was a 20 minute wait for a table - although on the other days this wasn't a problem. Food was excellent and service at breakfast was good. We didn't eat in the hotel in the evening (there are so many options in Chicago) but one evening when we were tired and tempted to stay in, we did notice the restaurant seemed quite high end and there didn't seem to be an option to have something simple like a Club sandwich in the evening. Only snacks/small plates were served in the bar. Again, I found this unusual for a hotel of this size. The location was brilliant - a stone's throw from the magnificent mile and only about 15 minutes walk from the river. We loved Chicago and were fortunate enough to see some of the Blues Festival which was fantastic. My top tip - take one of the (less well publicised) Chicago Architectural Foundation boat tours if you are even remotely interested in architecture. it was money very well spent and you get some great photo opportunities from the river."
65,244,Jul 25 2009 	Good Hotel brilliant location	I have nothing particularly bad to say about this hotel. It was in a great location. Very central to explore Chicago. The room was reasonably large and the bed was very comfortable. Fanstastic high definition flatscreen TV. However the bathroom left a bit to be desired as the shower head fell off whilst I was using it and the bath was quite small.The hotel has a good and large lobby and although we didn't use the bar it looked quite comfortable for a hotel bar. However the concierge was quite unhelpful when we left as there was a problem with the trains and we are going to the airport. She wasn't particularly forthcoming with advice and in fact told us the wrong information as it turned out. All in all this hotel did the job and I would stay there again if only for the location. However it didn't wow me and I'm surprised that it comes out as the number 1 hotel!
66,244,"Jul 25 2009 	this is a terrific hotel	we travelled with a group of friends to chicago for the fourth of july weekend. we stayed here based on the reviews on tripadvisor. we could not have been happier.this is a terrific hotel. the location is perfect as a base to explore the city.the hotel and its decor are very modern , so be sure that is what you are looking for. is is very clean. well appointed , very comfortable rooms. i found the staff to be very helpful and happy to assist with anything you need. there is also a bar , right off the lobby that is comfortable to sit in and review your day. i recommend it more highly."
67,244,"Jul 22 2009 	wonderful hotel	Thanks to ratings here, chose this hotel and got great deal online.It is on the upper end of Michigan Ave, but still only a 10-15 min walk to the river along all the shops. Modern and clean lobby and rooms, european style. Little complimentary bottles of Evian with turndown service were a bonus."
68,244,"Jul 19 2009 	OMG WOW!	This is the best hotel I have ever stayed at, by far. Heavenly beds to sleep on, spacious rooms, and amazing bathroom with giant tub! The towels were soft and the TV was awesome. The cleaning staff came through twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Best hotel ever!"
69,244,"Jul 18 2009 	Sofitel exceeded expectations	We wanted to stay near public transit and Michigan avenue and also give our teens a cultural experience and this hotel fit the bill. It does not have the typical ammenities that attract kids or teens, but it offered a look at contemporary architecture and design, provided a French feel, and superb service. Our room was a nice size, clean, unique, and the bathroom was exceptional. Little extra's were everywhere. One downside was the price of breakfast, but this was not a deal breaker. Staff was very accomodating and professional."
70,244,"Jul 17 2009 	Great Service Location and amenities	Upon a recent stay to the Sofitel Water Tower I was greeted by name at the front desk - the guest servies are above par in expecting guests needs. Room service was quick and quality of food wa excellent. the amenities in the room were great with tub and separate shower, large vanity. COuld have different lighting in bathroom as it was a bit bright - maybe a dimmer. ther ewas a shade for the large window overlooking the neighborhood.Restaurants are 2 blocks away, there is a great cafe across the street, and the hotel restaurant is a bit stuffy but the food is great. I enjoyed the doorman opening the door, remembering my name, and the front desk/ concierge. i would recommend for the business traveller, weekend warrior. One note a prostitute did try and romance me in the bar - but hey that means it is a swanky hotel!"
71,244,"Jul 17 2009 	Very solid choice--good balance between business and hip	As a business traveler who probably spends 30 nights/year in a hotel (conservatively), I'm usually have a pretty good set of options. In Chicago, I've stayed at the W City Center downtown in the Loop, the Trump, and the Hard Rock. Most recently I decided to take a trip to the Gold Coast area and stay at the Sofiftel.I've stayed at the Sofitel in Washington, DC, and have been impressed by the chain's balance between being hip and being a functional business hotel. The Chicago Water Tower location succeeded on both fronts.The lobby is dark and the decor is pretty hip without being too minimalistic or trying too hard. It's going to be hip for a guy who's used to staying at the Westin or Hilton but for a guy who's used to the W, it's gonna be more businesslike.Check-in was efficient, and the front-desk staff address you by name and ask if you have stayed with them before.Rooms are fairly spacious, with a very comfortable bed and decent toiletries from L' Occitane. Desk space is pretty good, and there is good closet space for longer stays. Rooms are quiet, and you have a good amount of privacy and quiet, even though you're in a fairly busy/hip area.The bathroom has a separate tub and shower, so you can take your shower while your girl soaks in a tub.Room service was decent. I had some kind of club sandwich with some tasty fries. There is a minibar in the room, which is reasonably stocked. I think there is ice service on all floors, as well.When checking out, I realized I had one bag too many and might get stopped if trying to do everything as carry-on, so while checking out at 4:30 a.m., I asked the concierge to ship my computer bag back to me. No problem, they said, and they directed housekeeping to pull the bag and e-mailed me the tracking number soon after. A very nice touch!I would definitely come back here. My next stay, however, is at the Dana Hotel &amp; Spa."
72,244,"Jul 16 2009 	Excellent - rooms staff food location everything	This place is about my perfect hotel.The rooms are superb and full of luxuryThe staff are excellent, attentive and really superbThe food is excellentThe location is excellent"
73,244,"Jul 16 2009 	Love love love this hotel	We stayed at the Sofitel about five years ago and really enjoyed it, so when we returned to Chicago last week we didn't look anywhere else. Great location, close to Michigan Ave, the Hancock Tower and public transportation. The rooms are fantastic with great bathrooms. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The bar was packed on Saturday night and the bartenders make a great martini! We had dinner one night at Pizano's across the street, fantastic!We went on to another hotel in another city and we missed the Sofitel!"
74,244,Jul 16 2009 	Pleasant but very impersonal	A recent stay at the Sofitel was pleasant. It is well placed but very impersonal. The concierge is well informed but not overly friendly. Having asked if a knowledge of French is ' de rigeur ' to work there and been told 'non' it is surprising to be greeted at all times in French in an English speaking city in an English speaking country!
75,244,"Jul 14 2009 	My Favorite Hotel	I'm currently staying in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for the third time in the last three months. I'm someone who is fortunate enough to travel fairly frequently in the U.S. and I go to Europe twice a year. I get to stay in some in very nice places, but this hotel is probably my favorite. i guess I like this place because it's rather upscale, but not in a stuffy way. The building itself is one of the major positive aspects of staying here. It is a beautiful, contemporary high rise. The rooms I've stayed in have always been in immaculate condition and have very nice, spacious marble bathrooms. This is a hotel that may not be right for everyone -- the design aesthetic is very modern. It also doesn't seem to offer rooms with twin beds. The rooms seem to all have king-size beds. But if having two beds isn't a requirement and you don't want traditional decor, this place is hard to beat. Everything about the physical facility of this hotel is really very good. I noticed on this stay that the door to my room has rubber seals around the door frame and a seal on the bottom of the door to help control noise from the hallway. I'm here in mid-July and the air conditioning in the room is great. I can set it to nearly frosty, if I want. There are a lot of elevators for a hotel of this size and I've never had to wait for an elevator for more than a few minutes. Compared to some of the hotels I've stayed in Chicago with problematic older buildings, this place is just immeasurably better. This evening I had dinner in Cafe des Architects, the hotel restaurant, and was very pleased with the good food and gracious service. The prices at the restaurant aren't cheap, but for dining in a first class hotel the prices seem very reasonable. I've found breakfast here to be very nice and the staff seems fully aware that you may require prompt service at breakfast. I've found good prices for this hotel at the Sofitel web site. I'm currently staying here for about $215 per night, for three nights, with a special deal for a $50 dollar hotel credit for dining, etc. The room I'm in is a deluxe king on a high floor with a terrific city view. Compared to other places I've stayed in Chicago, this seems to be a very good deal. A lot of the major chains with hotels in Chicago are as expensive, or more expensive, and they have lousy, outdated, rundown old buildings. There are, of course, some very nice ultra high-end hotels in Chicago. But for those of us who don't want to spring for the cost of the Park Hyatt or the Peninsula (both of which are in the same neighborhood as the Sofitel), I think the Sofitel Water Tower is a really good deal."
76,244,"Jul 13 2009 	Great Hotel in Great Location	We stayed at the Sofitel Water Tower in Chi-town for our anniversary weekend. I chose this hotel after a month of researching many hotels in the area. We had heard from people that the Sofitel in DC was a very nice place to stay and after reading the reviews on this one we decided to try it. The lobby of the hotel is very nicely decorated and the staff was helpful. Our suite on the 33rd floor had a good city view and the modern style of the room was pleasant as well (I am an interior designer and pretty picky about decor). We also liked the fact that the plasma TV was on a swivel so we could watch it from the sofa, or from the bed. The bathroom was nice, and although the shower was a bit on the small side, I enjoyed the L'occitane (French I assume) spa products offered. The icing on the cake for me though was the bar in the hotel. The atmosphere there was like no other, I could have stayed in there the entire time and they make a great dirty martini. The only complaint I can think of is that the waitress in the bar area couldn't find the NBA semi-finals on the TV in the bar area. She searched for a while then came and told us that she guessed they didn't have TNT. We were a bit shocked because we had just been watching it in our room before we came down. That was certainly minor, so it just goes to show you how well we enjoyed the hotel. The location was great as we were able to walk up to Michigan Ave in about 2 minutes and we walked to the Navy Pier in about 25.As a side note, the Tempo Cafe on the corner has the best breakfast (get the pancakes) and Ditkas (down the street) has a good menu and great food!"
77,244,"Jul 12 2009 	Beautiful hotel	I was traveling with my wife and two young children and decided to splurge on a &quot;suite&quot; at the Sofitel, given its excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. Although I lived in Chicago for six years, I've been away for nearly as long. Therefore, I assumed from the hotel's name &quot;Sofitel at the Chicago Water Tower&quot; that it was actually in the Water Tower Building. That of course is the Ritz, and the Sofitel is actually a block or two away. When we got up to our room, I was a bit disappointed as I had imagined a true suite with a separate bedroom where we could put our kids to sleep and close the door. When I called the front desk, they indicated that they did have such rooms, but it would be a $50 upgrade/night. We decided to do it, even though we were already paying over $200/night. I'm very glad we did.The the second room was much larger, and we did end up putting the kids to bed and spending the evening talking with friends. One of our friends was pregnant and ended up going into labor that night right in our room. We were able to get her over to Northwestern very easily while her husband went and grabbed the bag with all of their supplies. The comforts of the room were very nice to have in that situation.The only disappointment came when we called housekeeping around 1 PM to have them put sheets on the rollaway bed so our daughter could nap. They indicated they would bring them right up. I called again after 20 minutes, and they seemed surprised that I wanted them right away, but assured me someone was on the way. The concierge even called five minutes later to see if someone had brought them. Unfortunately, we still didn't have the sheets. After ninety minutes, we still didn't have any sheets and it was too late for her to take a nap.I called the manager (Jeff) later in the day to explain the situation. He was very apologetic, and assured me that he would personally make sure the sofabed was made up before we returned from dinner. When we did return, the bed was made and Jeff had even given the kids cookies and milk and a free movie. It was a very kind gesture and much appreciated gesture. I know that lapses in service can occur, but responses like Jeff's make me forget about them and remember the best things about the hotel. I'll definitely consider the Sofitel next time I'm looking to splurge in Chicago."
78,244,"Jul 9 2009 	Great Location Great Hotel!	We spent our 4th of July weekend at Sofitel, and would definitely return again, the rooms are great, the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are spacious, modern, and well appointed. We didnt try any of the restaurants, however we did hang out at the bar, use the business center to check in online for our flights early, and also found the stocked mini fridge conveinent (fee for food and drinks of course). THis location is walking distance to Michigan and State Sts and also very close to rush st for great bars and restaurants. Tempo Cafe - next door to hotel is also great for brunch or late night dining - just note that they only take cash and tend to have a wait around breakfast/brunch times. You will also be in walking distance to Walgreens for anything you need as well as a Giordano's for great pizza - love this place and would definitely return! We had a basic room and it was just fine for us, since we were out and about most of the day"
79,244,Jul 8 2009 	Great Stay	Had a great stay at the Sofitel. From the front desk to the bartenders and housekeep. Great place to stay for the price. Much different from other hotels. Very modern and upscale.We had a problem with our bill because we move some of the item in the mini refrig to fit our left over dinner food. Call the front desk and asked for a small frig and recieved one with no charge. Our bill was fixed and our stay was great. A very quite hotel.
80,244,"Jul 7 2009 	Beautiful.	Simply the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. The building, staff, beds and bathroom are all exquisite.We don't normally spend this much on a room, but it was worth it.Well worth the price..."
81,244,"Jul 6 2009 	Location Style and Comfort	We stayed at the Sofitel Water Tower over the 4th of July weekend and it was a very nice experience. The hotel is a bit mis-named since the Water Tower is at least 5-6 blocks away and you can't even see it from the hotel, but that is fine. The hotel is close enough to the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave to be convenient but far enough away that the traffic is light and the pace is a lot quieter. It is across from a lovely small park and just a few blocks from the nightlife on Rush Street and the condos and rowhouses of the Gold Coast. So a very nice spot to be.Our room on the 30th floor had a commanding view and was very nicely appointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and inviting. Modern art, a flat screen TV, a large desk and an lounge chair with footstool completed the room. The bathroom was very nice with lots of marble, nice lighting and nice amenities. Bring your own washcloth though as they only offer little mitts that may work well in the large tub but are not much use in the shower. Things that were missing that were a little surprising at a hotel of this caliber were a morning newspaper and no in room coffeemaker or free coffee in the lobby. And while the complimentary bottles of Evian water that accompanied the turndown service were welcome, so would have been some chocolates or mints. Check in service was very professional with the desk clerk even walking around the counter and into the lobby to welcome you and hand you your key card.We had an even numbered room and while it had nice city views, we suspect the views would be better on the odd number rooms since they would face Michigan Ave and Lake Michigan.A very nice place to stay. In the neighborhood we would recommend Bistro 110 and Devon Seafood Grill for closeby dining and the Lux Bar off nearby Rush Street for breakfast starting at 8 am."
82,244,"Jul 6 2009 	Splendid location and overall feel	I had booked this hotel directly in November of 08 as a gift to my 11 yr old son for one of his Christmas presents. He had always wanted to go to a Chicago Cubs game, and I had never been to Wrigley Field, so really we both got to experience something we have had to yet. Let me start by saying I have stayed in 5 star and 2 stars in my life. I travel all over the world, and you can check my reviews of most of my recent travels. I have rarely complained and feel am a good source for travelers. I chose this hotel due to its' reputation, location and service record. I feel I am not too picky, but do ask that if you tell me you can provide a service, that one should adhere to it. Upon booking this room, I requested a king bed and roll away for our 11 year old. Was told in Novemeber that this would not be a problem over the phone. I then in March called again to confirm our reservation and again requested that there be a roll away for our son. A lady named Bianaca emailed me that &quot; there would be no problem in getting a roll away and there was no problem&quot;.I also kept a copy of this email. So, I was rest assured upon driving 4 hours thand arriving at 11 am all was ok. The hotel itself is wonderful. I felt it was a cross between a Sofitel and a &quot;W&quot; hotel. Very modern, angular and clean. Valet was wonderful, and service was very good throughout. Upon entering the vibe was relaxing. Outdoor eating area, inside bar and lounge. Very nice, again like a &quot;W&quot;. We were greeted promptly by the front desk, and I was given a room right away. Impressive as we were early arrivals. I also asked her to verify that we needed a rollaway. She seemed surprised, I showed her my email, etc...and said no problem. I said we were in no hurry, as we were to get a bite to eat, and got shopping on Michigan, and anytime before 9 pm for the roll away would be fine. We went to our room on the 25th floor. Fast elevators, very clean. Entered our room, it was well appointed, huge bed, plasma, electric powered blinds, and a marble bathroom, that was to die for. The bathroom was 9 by 14 feet and had a tub, huge walkin marble shower, and nice toiletries. Well stocked towels and refridge. Very happy with the room, but the mirrored closet doors kept coming off track and closet space was minimal. Room safe was easy to operate and the provided robes and slippers (altough not used by us) were a nice touch. We unpacked and went down to the restaurant in the outdoor area of the hotel. Very nice, nice kids menu, mostly French. Lunch with drinks(wine) was around $150. Not bad for 3 in a nice hotel and area. We then went off and did some shopping etc. Came back to the room, took a shower and went down to watch the fireworks on The Odyessey ship that we had booked months in advance. After that we went back to the room at about midnight, and there was no rollaway. We called down to the front desk, and they stated they don't have rollaways at this hotel. I said that cant be, I have confirmed twice, along with an email, and again that morning with the front desk. Lets say, we didn't get our rollaway.We set up our son on the floor next to us best we could. The next day we went to a Cubs game, but on the way down I spoke with the concerige, stipulating this whole story once again, telling her I don't want an upgrade, I don't want anything free, all I want is to explain that I was deeply dissapointed that we have been lied to about the rollaway. She then said they DO have roll aways, and I told her, it is beyond that point, our son has made his &quot;nest &quot; on the floor and I just wanted them to know I was not happy with the &quot;run around&quot; and wanted to just &quot;vent&quot; and wanted nothing in return. We ended up going to the game, shopped and came back and took showers and went to Hugo's Frog down the street on Rush. Very nice, simular food to Morton's but a laid back atmosphere. Great service and nice vibe. Came back to the hotel , and room service got us extra towels, turned down the bed and made our son's &quot;nest&quot; a little nicer.(Thank you) That was a nice touch. Check out and valet were extremely fast. I must give a big thanks to Heather to whom was working with us throughout our stay and some prior. What a great person, and asset. Would I go back?.....absolutely. Restaurant food was impeccable, and their breakfasts are wonderful. Just maybe I would quadruple check any requests prior to arrival."
83,244,"Jul 1 2009 	Comfortable Suite Great Service Competitive Price	This place has one of the more professional desk, concierge, host, door and housekeeping staffs I've ever encountered Stateside. Absolutely attentive at every turn with no hint that your middling requests are an inconvenience. The Prestige suite features a good sized living room with a couch, love seat and sofa blocks, then a long hallway to an all marble bathroom, then onto a comfortable bedroom. Limited closet space I have to say for such a big room. Food in the restaurants and from room service were exceptionally good."
84,244,"Jun 29 2009 	Very Nice wonderful service	The rooms were not huge but very clean and beautiful. THe bed was soft and comfortable. The in-room wireless internet was a little spotty, but ultimately worked alright. The common areas were very nice, with the lobby smelling of fresh cut flowers each day. Very good hotel, with the one outstanding feature being the service...everyone we dealt with was incredibly helpful and friendly. Service sets this place apart."
85,244,"Jun 22 2009 	What can I say...	On a recent trip to Chicago to attend a major trade show I had the pleasure of staying with the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. I say stay with as that is how they make you feel, from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return.The rooms are clean, chic and roomy, the beds - the best I have slept in, bathrooms large and super clean.What can I say, my new home when in Chicago..."
86,244,"Jun 19 2009 	Gorgeous Hotel in a Great Location	The Sofitel Water Tower Hotel was perfect for our Chicago visit. The interior is gorgeous, but its the staff that treats you like royalty even if youre in a pair of sneakers and jeans. This hotel definitely deserves its high ranking on Trip Advisor. Heres my take on the Sofitel:STAFF--Over-the-top genuinely friendly and helpful. From the moment we got out of our taxi, the bell hops were there to assist with luggage and get us to our room. The front desk had a good system in place. While one person was keying in our information on the computer, someone else chatted with us making us feel even more welcome. Room Service personnel are some of the best Ive experienced. The Concierge Staff, especially Jacquie, offered great suggestions that really made for a great weekend. She told us about the best restaurants in the area, and gave us great suggestions on what to do, including a beautiful boat ride and absolutely wonderful bike tour. Thank you Concierge staff.ROOMS--Tastefully decorated, comfortable beds and but average in size. All of the needed hotel ammenities were provided.VIEW--I booked a Deluxe Room which had great views of Rush Street, down toward Michigan Avenue. We were 20 some stories up and the view was spectacular. LOCATION--Cant be beat. Right on Rush and State Street, blocks from Michigan Avenue and shopping. Blocks from the Rush Street Entertainment Area, and blocks from the Lake Michigan Lakefront and Bike Path. All these are must sees while in Chicago and the hotel is perfect for all of them.RATES--You can definitely find a less expensive hotel, but you wont have the same experience anywhere else for the price."
87,244,"Jun 11 2009 	Excellent! Trendy and Chic. One of the best places to stay!	It is indeed one of the best hotels I've stayed so far. Very trendy. Staff is courteous, room service is awesome, view is amazing, decor is fantastic, I mean almost close to perfect! Just that it doesn't have a swimming pool and spa, and not many food options within the hotel (though room service is very good). I would strongly recommend this to everyone who visits Chicago"
88,244,"Jun 6 2009 	Outstanding Accommodations	Based largely on the TA reviews, we selected the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a five-day stay in May 2009. We were not at all disappointed! Our room was comfortable and spotless; the staff was very accommodating, and the meals we had at the hotel left us wanting to come back for more. The location is convenient to shopping and restaurants, with public transit about two blocks away. Considering the level of comfort offered, we thought the hotel was an excellent value (especially when booked early at a discounted price). Without a doubt, when we come back to Chicago we will plan to stay at the Sofitel."
89,244,"Jun 4 2009 	Great hotel in great location!	Stayed in the Sofitel in November 2008 for a winter get away. Staff very friendly, room huge with comfy bed, lots of space, large flat screen TV and large luxurious bathroom.Location spot on at the beginning/end (depending on where you're coming from) of the Mag mile and near some great resteraunts (Hugos Frog Bar being one of them).Couldn't fault anything and will definately be returning."
90,244,"Jun 3 2009 	Fantastic hotel - would definitely recommend	Have just returned from a 1 week stay at the Sofitel and had a brilliant time. First of all the location is excellent, just a few minutes walk from the Mag Mile. The hotel is very modern and very clean with contemporay decor throughout. We had a King size room on the 28th floor with great views of the city and lake beyond. The bed was very very comfy (and huge!). The bathroom was great with a bath and separate walk in shower , L'Occitaine products and bathrobes. Free water was delivered to our room every night. The reception staff were very friendly and the service great. Free internet access on the 2nd floor, a nice extra touch. They also let us have the room for an extra few hours on the day of checkout, no charge, no fuss - really helped us. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food. We were put off by the price of the breakfast and thought that staying in the heart of the city we should be able to hunt out our own breakfast for cheaper - which we did!! There is a breakfast place on the corner of the block called 'The Goddess' which serves good coffee, filled croissants, bagels etc. We also visited L'Apetitio many times which is a fab little Italian deli at the bottom of the John Hancock Centre (5mins walk from the hotel on the Mag Mile) - they have yummy toasted sandwiches, croissants, muffins and coffee and you can fill up for a lot less than the cost of a hotel breakfast. Both places you can eat in or take out. Overall well worth the money and I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for modern luxury and excellent service in the heart of Chicago."
91,244,"May 28 2009 	It is hard to say more...	We, my wife and myself, stayed there for three days and I have to say that all good reviews here are perfectly accurate. This hotel is almost perfect !!The building is an architectural piece of art, everything seems to be cared in the details, the room, we had an executive suite, is spacious and confortable, everything is new and well kept. The bed is quite comfortable, the marble bathroom is huge with the shower space separate of the bathtub, what is quite nice.The location is perfect, just two blocks from magnificent mile and within walking distance of all Chicago downtown atractions .The staff is perfect, they helped us in a very professional and personal way.The only two things I think they have space to improve are, first is the hotel breakfast that is good but a little pricey ($ 50 for two), there is no buffet, and the food tastes too American to me, I would prefer a more European style breakfast, Maybe it should be better if we had breakfast in some other place. The second one is the fitness center that is too small and crowded, the equipments are very well but the space deserves an improvement, specially in a city with such inclement weather like Chicago !!Overall, this is one of the best hotels I have ever been, I strongly recomend it to everyone !!Last of all I would like to recommend an Italian restaurant, Rosebud on Rush, that is two blocks from the Hotel. It is cheap and has a marvelous Italian food and a quite good wine list that makes us very happy !!"
92,244,"May 24 2009 	Absolutely PERFECT.	I booked this hotel for a romantic getaway with my girlfriend based almost exclusively on the Tripadvisor ratings, all of which were based on hundreds of rave reviews. Count me in as among the same, this was an OUTSTANDING experience! I travel for a living and know a good hotel when I see it and this is among the top 1% of experiences I have ever had. Splurge and get the executive suite, it was perfect! Strongly recommend passing on the $20 breakfast as the Tempo Cafe is THE place for breakfast, just right around the corner on the same block at half the price (awesome food!). Next time I'm in Chicago, this is the only place I will settle for, location, value, comfort, class, service ... all first class, truly a perfect experience all-around!"
93,244,"May 22 2009 	Well appointed hotel in good location. Great pastry chef of course!	Stayed 4 nights for cost of 3. Suite was a relatively good deal - comfortable and well appointed tho' on a relatively low floor given the tall buildings in the neighborhood. Service was excellent all around. Hotel restaurant was too crowded (with locals?) to accommodate us on Sunday morning, but concierge steered us to several nice neighborhood alternatives. Delicious pastries in the restaurant and addictive french candies at the front desk."
94,244,"May 17 2009 	Extremely good hotel- excellent staff	Absolutely everything is first rate at this hotel with only ONE downside.Charging $47 PER NIGHT for parking is a massive turn off.If you're not parking, this is a first rate hotel. restaurants are nearby as is all possible shopping.Try Japonais Restaurant for an absolutely memorable meal but be warned, either book or you will not get in."
95,244,"May 12 2009 	Great hotel. Great location.	The hotel has everything you need for a weekend away (or longer!). Decor is fab and the staff are really friendly and very helpful. Hotel is located about 2 minutes walk from Michigan Avenue, right near the John Hancock building and lots of shops. I always judge a hotel room by the bathroom...this one was lovely! The room was a good size (we had a good sized crib which wasn't a problem in a standard room) and the bed was very comfortable. We didn't eat at the restaurant (just didn't fancy anything on the menu) but we had drinks and desserts in the hotel bar (Le Bar) and they were delicious. Tempo Cafe is on the same street as the hotel (about 1 minute walk) and serves a great breakfast/brunch - it gets really busy on a Sat/Sun AM but it's worth the wait. We didn't drive, but parking at the hotel looked pretty pricey (although I'm unsure of parking rates in Chicago in general!) Nothing bad to say about the hotel or Chicago. Loved it!"
96,244,"May 11 2009 	Perfect Hotel for First Chicago Visit	Stayed three nights at the Sofitel on a 'third night free' offer - extremely good value. Booked a 'suite' and was upgraded to a one bedroom suite on floor 15. The rooms were great with a good sized living room and a vestibule leading off to the bathroom and bedroom. Floor to ceiling glazing along one wall meant the entire suite was light and airy whilst the orientation allowed it to feel quite private too. Great bed. Good bathroom - although the bath seemed quite high and whilst I wouldn't say it was small (as other reviewers have commented) it is a European size ie deeper than a typical US bath. The service in the hotel is faultless. We did not have to open the front door once, if it rained umbrellas were provided in abundance at the door and the concierge service is excellent and helped with everything from restaurant reservations (and cancellations) to site seeing and TV scheduling....... Well we didn't want to miss the American Idol results. Good location too one block from the John Hancock tower and the top end of Michigan Ave plus easy access to all the stores. Plenty of good restaurants and coffee shops around. Any negatives? well there was no chocolate on the pillow with turndown but I would prefer the cool bottle of Evian provided on my bedside cabinet any day."
97,244,"May 8 2009 	Wonderful experience	Stayed two nights in this hotel for our 20th anniversary. The location is fantastic, near great shopping, restaraunts and entertainment. The staff was great. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in. I wanted to take it home with me! The rooms and halls were quiet and peaceful. The bathroom was incredible, sparkling marble, huge space, impecably clean. The only down side was how expensive it was to park our car. YIKES! Over all we could not have asked for a better hotel and we will definately stay here again. It was worth every penny."
98,244,"May 7 2009 	Not amazing but a very nice hotel	Does the Sofitel deserve to be number 1 on tripadvisor? Possibly. It's housed in a great neighbourhood near some lovely bars and restaurants which has a bit more character than the heart of downtown. It is also set in an architecturally very impressive building. The service, especially from the concierge, was absolutely great and they booked us dinners at some very nice restaurants. I also liked the little touches like the free internet and printing as well as the trendy bar with its rather lethal absyinth menu! So why not 5 stars? Well our 'luxury' room was nice but nothing amazing. The bed wasn't that big though it was very comfy and while the room was quite big for a city hotel, I wouldn't say that it had any wow factors. It was also slightly business-like with a pine desk area that could have been lifted from an IKEA catalogue. I also agree with the reviewer below about the bathtubs - they are far, far too small and it really is difficult to have a relaxing soak. So overall it was fine and I certainly didn't regret staying at the Sofitel, but perhaps if I go back to Chicago i'd look for somewhere where the room was a bit more luxurious."
99,244,"May 2 2009 	Perfect Location	My daughter and I spent two nights at the Sofitel Water Tower for a college visit. Although we had little time to take advantage of the many amenities offered by the hotel, we found the rooms clean, and the beds super comfortable. As this was our first trip to Chicago we were thrilled by the location of this hotel which is in walking distance to Lake Michigan, tons of shopping, and many other attractions. All of the hotel staff that we encountered during our stay were courteous and professional."
100,244,"Apr 29 2009 	Great location great service	We lived close by when we lived in Chicago, on Chicago and Wabash, and purposely chose to return to that area because of the convenience factor. Excellent restaurants are within 5-15 min walk, with shopping close by. Subway (red line) is 1 1/2 block away (Chicago and Wabash). 3-4 grocery stores within 15 min walk (Potash Brothers closest, Trader Joe, Whole Foods, and Jewel-Osco). Service at the hotel was excellent, and hotel room is typical Sofitel standards - not much else to add if you've been to other Sofitels before."
101,244,"Apr 27 2009 	I don't get it	Was &quot;wowed&quot; by all the reviews here, so excited about booking for our stay. I am an interior designer and also really love hotels, so judging by the reviews, versus our experience, I can only conclude that we got the stump-end room of the whole place. Our room was absolutely tiny; to get from door to sleeping area, you went down a very narrow hall. Bed was about 9&quot; away from the closet which ran along-side, making it a hassle to hang clothes. I am fussy about lighting; one lamp on desk gave a soft glow, while the uber-modern sconces flanking the bed gave a harsh, in-your-eyes glare--not cool. Bath lighting had only bright and bright as options, again not cool for romantic bath, etc. Bath: Had separate tub and shower, but I am a 5 foot, nine-inch tall woman, and the cheap, acrylic tub was so crampy, there was no nice bath to be had there. Bath toiletries were a European label with &quot;natural&quot; in the name...and all were very chemical when you looked at the label, not a shea butter or green tea extract, etc., in sight, only un-pronounce-able ingredients--yuk! Robe was nice, slippers nice touch. Loofah was nice, but again--could not enjoy in the micro-tub that was no nicer than a Motel 6.Bed was very comfortable--But we think it was a queen, is that possible??? Seemed smaller than a king, my husband swore it was queen-size, while we had ordered king. But plush and comfy. Not good reading light, however.So while we would not stay there again (and in fact, after 2 nights moved to the Talbott around the corner which, while being completely different (traditional vs. super-mod), was very cozy and well-done, it was the A player of the trip to be sure!)--I have to conclude that we must have somehow been given one of the very few extremely average-to-poor rooms of the whole place. Yes, has cool super-hip lobby, slick bar, but so does your average Marriott these days. Devotees, enjoy--But we just DIDN'T GET IT!"
102,244,"Apr 23 2009 	A 5 Star Experience	Not only was the hotel highly convienient to everything but the service knocked me out. The concierges are first rate ( Thank you Heather and Brian) and so is the rest of the staff. Any request was responded to quickly and with extra courtesy. I had a taxi accident and needed ice for my injuries and the bell man brought up packages of chipped ice wrapped in towels. Another example among many, was a housekeeper who was vacumning, saw me coming and pushed the elevator button so I wouldnt have to wait. The General Manager ought to be quite proud of his staff. The dining room didnt disappoint. I enjoyed a wonderful appetizer of tuna tartar with an avocado relish on top. For dessert I was one happy camper. Picture a shallow bowl of pink strawberry crme Anglaise and a white floating island, almost like a fluffy cloud of white poached meringue, sitting on top. Underneath the floating island a scoop of stewed rhubarb was tucked into the bottom of the white puff. I wondered why dishes like this arent are more menus and then of course, I realized I was in a French hotel. I say Bravo. And for those of you traveling at different seasons, the chef recreates the dishes based on seasonal ingredients.If you are watching your weight check out the egg white scramble."
103,244,"Apr 22 2009 	Nice Hotel Good Location	I read many reviews here prior to selecting the Sofitel Water Tower for my recent visit and couldn't believe how glowing the majority were...sounded fantastic. After having stayed five nights, I can attest that the hotel is nice and very well situated. Service is courteous and prompt, but not outstanding...I don't think it was anything more than I've experienced at other hotels. If you want a solid, well situated hotel in the heart of Chicago it's great...just not extraordinary. I thought it a little odd that wireless internet access was provided by a third party for less than the hotel's own wired service. That said I would reccomend the hotel and it provides decent value overall."
104,244,"Apr 18 2009 	Excellent hotel great location	Sofitels can be a bit hit and miss, but this one is really great. I had a room on the top floor with amazing views. The room and bathroom were both a good size and very clean. All the furniture seemed very new, with none of the tattiness you see at some of the other Sofitels. As an A-Club member, I got a voucher for a free drink at the bar, which was very atmospheric, with floor to ceiling windows giving a great view of the snowstorm outside. The restaurant was good too.The location is nice, close to some great shopping and lots of restaurants. I'd definitely stay here again."
105,244,"Apr 16 2009 	truly great hotel	I do quite a bit of travelling and love boutique hotels. There is something about the Sofitel chain that I feel makes them really wonderful places to stay around the world. I usually stay at Sutton Place Hotel or here and this hotel is better. It's just something they do that makes it better than a lot of other 4 star hotels. Rooms are oh so clean - no dust that you might find in other places. Bathrooms are PRISTINE. Size of room is large but the design still makes the room cozy - just a different feel than your standard avg. hotel room. The hallways and elevators are beautifully decorated and the view from the 17th fl is amazing! The beds have featherbeds so their uber comfy and rooms offer plenty desk space if you are working. The hotel charges for wi-fi in rooms but Tmobile is cheaper per day you can get too. There's a level of quality that makes this hotel my fave in Chicago. There are other cuter more boutique hotels that actually fit my style but Sofitel has for me always been clean, service friendly and consistent most importantly. I like that the staff is courteous, helpful and friendly - professional - w/o trying to be your friend which some hotels do. I'm from Chicago just visiting on this trip but if in Chicago for the 1st time, location in Gold Coast is ideal for restaurants and shopping."
106,244,Apr 9 2009 	best hotel in chicago	myself and my wife stayed here for 7 nights and i have to say that this hotel is excellent. the rooms were large and very clean and the bathrooms again were large and clean.the hotels location is its selling point with everything on your doorstep. we never tried the hotel restaurant simply because there were so many nice places to eat around but it was always busy. staff were very attentive and i had good fun with the bar staff. overall i would tell anyone reading this review to stop wasting their time reading about other chicago hotels as the sofitel was perfect..........i spend around 6 months per year in hotels because of work so i should know !!
107,244,"Apr 6 2009 	Terrific Hotel and Location	The Sofitel Water Tower Place is one of my favorite hotels in America. I probably spend an average of 15 nights per year there and have never been disappointed. The location is great - just one block from Michigan Avenue, Water Tower Place, and Two blocks from the high end fashion on Oak Street. Also easy walking distance to Gibson's, The Whiskey Bar, Level night club, Le Coloniale restaurant, and the really rowdy party district up at the end of Rush Street. You will not hear a sound once inside your room.The staff is very attentive without being pushy (I can cary my own bag, thank you). I am often surprised when the parking valet or one of the desk staff remember my name even when I haven't been to the hotel in several weeks.The lobby is spacious and modern and has a great vibe. A very international clientelle stay here. The rooms are well appointed, I believe they all now have flat screen HDTV. The feel is luxurious contemporary and the bed is perhaps the best anywhere. Just crawl under that big Frette comforter, pile up the pillows, and you'll never want to leave.Bathrooms are fantastic. Cream marble and blonde maple finishes. The best designed vanity mirror/light anywhere. Good shower pressure (some bathrooms on outside walls can take a long time to get hot water in winter months) and very nice bath product.All rooms are of a nice size. The upgrade to &quot;executive&quot; (or whatever they call it) gets you a larger work desk and small seating area. Most of these rooms also have a separate tub and shower.If you splurge on a suite, ask for a room ending in 01 or 08. The 01 rooms are on the triangular point of the hotel and have a nice living area separated from the bedroom. Each of these rooms is somewhat unique, as the corner of the building expands the higher up you go. The 08 rooms are even larger still and have an even larger bathroom with separate toilet room, shower, bath tub (no Jacuzzi) and lots of room to spread out.Unforttunately, over the years, many highrise buildings have been built around the hotel, and lake views are very limited. There are still some great views of the city.Le Bar downstairs is a very good spot for cocktails and often has great scenery no matter what your gender or orientation. You can also get dinner served here from Les Architects, the hotel restaurant. Les Architects has always been a good restaurant. However, they brought in a new chef aboout a year ago and the quality has improved significantly. Some VERY good food here.If you want to camp in the room without using room service, there is a Potash Bros. market just behind the hotel and a very nice wine and gourmet food store as well.If you have stayed at the Sofitel in Rosemont near O'Hare and were unimpressed - so was I. The Water Tower Place location is 100 times nicer.I also recommend The James hotel in this same general part of the city."
108,244,"Apr 4 2009 	Best place in downtown chicago and i've tried a few	this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago, and I've been to this hotel at least 4 times. the rooms are clean, wonderfully designed and comfortable. The staff is friendly, service focused - and the restuarant is great, especially for the breakfast fruit crepes. Love this hotel. It's a great location, very good and consistent service and quality ."
109,244,"Apr 3 2009 	Good value - walking distance to Michigan Ave lake Water Tower...	I am a new fan of Trip Advisor and Sofitel. My husband and I wanted to get away to the city for a day and do sightseeing. We booked Sofitel since Trip Advisor rated it so high. It fufilled the expectations. We were able to check-in at 9:30am, drop off luggage and walk the couple of blocks to Water Tower, Hancock, Michigan Ave. etc. We'd hoped to catch the sunrise over the lake in the a.m but it couldn't be seen from our window( tho I recommend the higher floors for the view of the city). So it was a fun 10 min walk to the lake in the early hours. Appreciated the earlier reviews of the El Tempe Restaurant for breakfast and Pizzeria Due for dinner - worked out well. There is a nice stocked fridge in the room and the Evian water on the nighstand before bed was a nice surprise. The fitness room is a bit tight for space but had bowls of apples and bananas, nice touch.Absolutely no complaints."
110,244,"Mar 25 2009 	Very nice hotel	Very nice hotel with excellent staff. The large room size and exceptionally helpful staff are really what make this place great. I was able to check in early and easily got a large room on a top floor simply by asking for it. I failed to pack an umbrella but the hotel was happy to let me borrow one during my stay. The bathroom was spacious too with lots of amenities and a separate walk-in shower. The room had everything except a coffee maker. If you need coffee in the morning, you can get complimentary coffee downstairs in the restaurant downstairs (which happens to be very good) starting at 6am. If you are on a tight budget, don't look to the hotel bar to save any $$. It's good but expensive. I agree with everyone else--the Tempo cafe at the end of the block is the place to go for a hearty breakfast. Please note, they only take cash. There is also a Starbucks around the corner. For dinner, I highly recommend walking a few blocks to Pizzeria Due for their classic Chicago deep-dish pizza. It's about $10 and you'll have to wait 30 minutes. It's worth every minute! Another good option is Frontera Grill for some gourmet Mexican food (just be sure to make a reservation). Only downside is that you have to pay for internet access from your room. Otherwise, they offer a business center with free internet access."
111,244,"Mar 23 2009 	Top floor with a view of the lake	Excellent stay, staff friendly and efficient. We had a large well appointed room on the top floor with a view of the lake, nice bathroom. Starbucks and Potash grocers within a block if you need coffee or beer and prefer not to pay 5* prices."
112,244,"Mar 18 2009 	Can't Wait to Go Back	We usually stay at the same hotel in Chicago but decided to do something different. I am so glad we decided to try this hotel!! The lobby smelled WONDERFUL. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was exactly how it appears in the pictures. We will definitely stay at this hotel again. Go ahead and splurge at least once. You'll be glad you did. For a great inexpensive breakfast, try the little restaurant on the opposite end of the hotel named El Tempo Cafe. Nice portions for a great price."
113,244,"Mar 16 2009 	excellent hotel - staff so helpful in crisis; can't wait to return	my wife and two teenage daughters stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in late july 2008.unfortunately, our elder daughter took ill on the first night of our stay and had to spend the rest of the time in hospital before she was discharged and considered well enough to fly down to florida.the hotel were brilliant in helping us with her illness, and the reception staff invariably asked how she was doing as we passed in &amp; out of the hotel on our way to visit her in the hospitalnevertheless, the hotel was great and we are determined to return and enjoy the hotel in happier circumstancesthe good things this hotel did for us was arrange for a limo to meet us at the airport, suggest and arrange on our first day (before illness struck) for us to go on a historic river cruise (the concierge got us the last 4 tkts for the last cruise of the day), and also when our daughter became ill in the middle of the night were very quickly and courteously on the scene to see why we were running from one room to another at 4 a.m. they also arranged a taxi and guided us to the nearest emergency room, phoning first whilst we were on our way to advise them of our imminent arrival.in our opinion, there are two massive factors when rating a hotel: cleanliness being the absolute first, and location thereafter. the common areas, bedrooms and bathrooms of the hotel were spotless; towels and bedding crisp and clean; a great range of toiletries in the bathroom. the hotel is brilliantly situated, a safe walk from the main shops and sights in central chicago our daughter's illness had no connection with our stay at the hotel (it was a return of the kidney stones she had suffered some weeks before our arrival in the US), and the care shown by the night staff / security team who responded in the early hours presumably because they had seen us dashing across the hallway on CCTV was exceptionally reassuring in retrospect.the hotel was also good value; had we booked when we first chose to stay there the prices were sensational, but by the time we actually booked a few weeks later the prices had gone up - still reasonable but the first prices were fantastic and we regret not booking then. clearly, if you are in a position to book several months in advance, savings can be made!!"
114,244,"Mar 14 2009 	We are spoiled now!	We got a good deal on a suite at the Sofitel and decided to splurge, and were not disappointed! The hotel location is fantastic -- so nice to walk just 2 blocks and be at Water Tower Place -- and the property itself is great. Our suite was modern and bright and impeccably clean, with great views of the city. Beautiful, fresh orchids in living room and bathroom, and turn down service with a personalized note and chocolates. Roomy bathroom, bedroom, and living room. The safe that's big enough to accomodate a laptop was great -- most are too small. We had two kids with us and when we called to get linens for the sofabed, housekeeping staff came and made the bed and quickly took care of requests for extra pillows, etc. The concierge was great with restaurant recommendations, too, and didn't try to push us into the hotel's spot. Would love to return! One note... it's not the hotel's fault, but parking is pricey. There's an attached but independent garage, and it cost us $34 a day. Ouch. Would be great if Sofitel could work out some sort of validation / discount with them."
115,244,Mar 10 2009 	good value	Got a great rate here. Very stylish decor and relatively small hotel. friendly staff. We were upgraded for free but supplement for king size bed is a bit steep otherwise. Happening bar. Liked free computers available to use
116,244,Mar 8 2009 	Best Hotel in Chicago	Every thing is top notch at the sofitel. The minute you arrive your are immursed in pure luxury. The prestige suite we stayed in is very spacious and luxurieous. Bath room is great with wall to wall marble. Great service from the staff. Best stay in Chicago!
117,244,"Mar 4 2009 	Clean comfortable great location!	Stayed two nights with the better half for a birthday weekend in the city, and we were very pleased with this hotel. We decided to spring for a suite since it was my birthday. We received a very nice rate booking directly from the hotel website; much cheaper than standard rooms at comparable hotels. Our room was spotless, and very well appointed with two flat screen TVs, and a Bose Wave Radio on the nightstand - a nice touch. The staff were always friendly and we were always greeted with a &quot;hello&quot; and a smile when passing in the hallway. Despite the great room and friendly staff, the main attraction of the Sofitel is the location - just steps from some of Chicago's most iconic destinations. Overall, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
118,244,Feb 24 2009 	Don't mistake high price with high quality.	Great hotel in great location. 2 blocks east to north end of Michigan Ave near Hancock / Water Tower Place and 900 Shops. 2 blocks south to Chicago stop of Red Line subway. Good McCormick &amp; Schmicks across the street. Coffee shop (Tempo) and 2 small markets (Potash &amp; Goddess and the Grocer) on same city block as hotel. Great bed - great bathroom - good (mostly just numerous) staff. Stay here or try other top end properties.
119,244,"Feb 22 2009 	Great location. Fantastic bed	I read the great reviews in advance and was not disappointed. Everything was pretty much first-rate, especially the bed. The staff were also great.Okay so paying for the wireless was a bit of a downer, but most of downtown Chicago is within easy walking distance, so why are you in your room surfing the web."
120,244,"Feb 19 2009 	Excellent experience	Went for a long weekend for Valentine's day - from the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the service was excellent. The room (King suite) was spacious and nicely decorated, the hotel is in a great location and the staff were very helpful. Definitely would recommend."
121,244,"Feb 19 2009 	Best Hotel I have ever stayed !	Just got back after my Girlfriend booked a Valentines weekend trip to Chicago !What can I say ?? .... She booked a Junior suite only to find they upgraded us to an Executive suite ... Kingsize bed, big flat screen tv in one room .... big flat screen tv with Bose sound system in the lounge area, which also had a nice glass desk with fast internet connection ($9.95 per day) and sofas to relax on. Beware of the mini bar though .. can of Coke $5 !!!We had a nice big marble floor bathroom .. with a big bath and a large walk in showerLike other have said .. the beds and pillows were so comfortable !We didnt eat in the hotel, but had a massive breakfast at the Tempo Cafe next door which kept us going till we had dinner in the evening.The staff were heplful and polite .. the decor of the hotel was very nice and the foyer had nice smelling candles burning .. the location was good ... 200 yards from the Water Tower shopping mall, Magnificent Mile, Hancock Building and the Cheesecake Factory.We cannot fault this hotel at all ... it was awesome .. it was the icing on the cake for such a memoriable trip to a great city !!"
122,244,"Feb 16 2009 	Great hotel	Fantastic hotel. Staff were great, room was huge (it was a top floor suite) and comfortable. Room service was great. We has no faults at all while here. Location is great as well."
123,244,Feb 6 2009 	I want to live at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower	This was such a nice hotel. the rooms were large and comfortable and the staff were amazing! The location is just a few blocks from the Mag Mile and we walked everywhere. You're also just a couple blocks from the Red Line which got us to The Green Mill and Wrigley Field and shopping in Lincoln Park for just $2.25. The restaurant and bar had excellent service and great food. I would go back to Chicago just for this hotel. It was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. I loved it!
124,244,"Feb 3 2009 	Great hotel great location!	We stayed in Chicago for a short break end Nov/Dec 08.Hotel was great. Lovely rooms with little luxuries. Friendly atmosphere, attentive staff. Most amazing breakfasts in the French restaurant. Room service prompt and delicious though expensive. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurant for lunch or dinner.Situated on a quiet street just off Michigan Ave. Fantastic location for shopping and sightseeing. Main sights (John Hancock Tower, lake, pier, river, shops) within walking distance. Chicago is a fantastic city with lots to see and do - we wanted to move there after we had visited!!Knowledgable concierge, arranged an architectural river cruise for us which was fantastic. Would recommend this hotel, and Chiacgo for a fantastic break. Would stay there again should we return to Chicago (hope to soon)."
125,244,"Feb 2 2009 	Great Chicago Hotel !	Stayed here for a family wedding and really was impressed with this hotel ! The location is perfect for shopping and (in warmer temps) walking to some nice restaurants. Rooms are nice with oversized bathrooms. The actual sleeping area is a little smaller than I anticipated, but rooms are kept very clean matching the contemporary style. The front desk is very helpful and the gym is small, but effective with a good amount of treadmills and free weights. Beds are comfortable, but they are soft... Those with back issues take note.Note that the hotel does not have a gift shop or snack shop. A great $1/coffee Internet cafe is directly across the street as is Tempo Restaurant where breakfast is spectacular ! Their staff is friendly, helpful and seem to enjoy their jobs. A great hotel !"
126,244,"Jan 19 2009 	Unbeatable place to stay in Chicago	Based on other TripAdvisor comments, we booked two nights there this past weekend. Turned out to be absolutely the right choice.1) Great location, just off Michigan Avenue and all the shopping, an easy walk downtown to the Art Institute, lots of interesting streets all around, a few blocks from the lake front.2) Beautiful room, unbelievably cushy bed, lots of bathroom amenities, cool view, etc. etc. 3) Very good French-oriented restaurant in the lobby, Cafe Architects, which also apparently handles the exquisite room service. We ate a light dinner downstairs, had room service, both were excellent. 4) For breakfast, though, ignore their pricey option and go where everyone in the area goes: walk the fifty feet from the front door to Tempo Cafe (www.tempocafechicago.com). Worth the wait, if you have to.5) Really fine service. We had a small issue with hot water, they had a servuice guy at the room in two minutes fixing it. The concierge in the lobby had the answer to any question we had, and, when we said we needed a charger for a cellphone, pulled out a box of them left behind by previous guests!Overall, definitely worth it. And my suspicion is that there are always room deals to be had."
127,244,"Jan 4 2009 	Great experience!!	My husband and I had a fantastic stay at the Sofitel! The highlights:-incredibly friendly and helpful staff. They de-feathered my room (I have a feather allergy) without any sort of complaint, and at the convenience of my husband and I. I rarely experience that anywhere - many hotels ignore my requests until I demand it.-our room. The staff gave us a free upgrade from a low floor to a room on the 28th floor with an incredible view of the Hancock and the lake. The bathroom was amazing, the view was (again) incredible, and the bathrobe/slippers were super comfy.-location. We went to Morton's (just a few blocks away) for dinner, and passed a number of other great restaurants on the way.-restaurant. We had an amazing Sunday brunch at Cafe des Architectes. We both got the brunch sampler, and it was absolutely delicious.Overall, it was a fantastic stay. We were nothing but pleased and will definitely stay there again!"
128,244,Jan 3 2009 	Amazing Hotel	This hotel was amazing. We had a suite and it was very comfortable. The room was very clean and tidy.It was in a perfect location and felt very safe.The staff were all very friendly towards us and very polite.The free internet was nice although I couldn't seem to get the wireless to work for free and had to use the network cable on the desk.The highlight was the bathroom! Have never stayed in a hotel with such a huge bathroom!Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
129,244,"Jan 3 2009	Great...but not sure all the packages are worth bothering with	Mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. First the good: Outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland, as befitted the season. The restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them, remember clients clearly from one day to the other, and go above and beyond consistently). Rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! The gym is well equipped. Second the slightly off putting:mmmhh...we got the &quot;I love chocolate package&quot; which advertized: bfast every day, dinner once, snack once and...a gift. And we have an A-Club favorite guest membership, which also advertized &quot; a gift&quot;. So, no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. Upon enquiry, &quot;the snack was the gift&quot;. Not at all what the package suggested. That said, bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. Some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem.Would absolutely go back, but probably not on a special package."
130,244,"Dec 27 2008 	Perfect Choice For A Get-Away	My wife and I take a yearly trip to The Sofitel. The hotel is perfect for our get-away. Rooms are impressively decorated, comfortable and very quiet. The staff is efficient, professional and helpful. The lounge provides a relaxing venue to enjoy a libation and conversation. We ate breakfast at tthe hotel restaurant and enjoyed it immensely. The hotel is very close to shopping areas and the Rush Street restaurant/club area. We look forward to visiting again next year,. There really is no reason to go elsewhere."
131,244,"Dec 22 2008 	modern decor nice change	Loved the modern, abstract, and innovative public areas. Food very good. Service very good. And consistent. Would definately stay here again if price was right."
132,244,"Dec 11 2008 	Simply FANTASTIC !!!!!	We used Trip Adviser when booking a hotel for our recent trip to Chicago and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is justifiably at the top of the rankings - it's in a great location, stylish but not pretentious, rooms are outstanding with everything and more you could want - and the beds are out of this world. The staff are all extremely helpful and professional as well as being extremely personable. We were made to feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. We can recommend the hotel bar for its ambience - we also used room service which was excellent. The hotel is surrounded by great places to eat and drink - we can recommend McCormick &amp; Schmick's right across the street for its fantastic seafood. We'd definitely stay here again when we go back to Chicago.Chris &amp; Viv, Manchester, England"
133,244,"Dec 10 2008 	Very disappointed!	After reading the Trip Advisor reviews, I was expecting an exceptional stay. I was not impressed overall. The concierge, the view, and the hotel resturant were the highlights. The bed, although not horrible, was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home, and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. I was traveling for business, and although not dressed in formalwear, was also not dressed down, but all in all, it felt a bit pretentious to me. There are better options for the money, and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place, Sheraton Towers, or Trump for the similar price and better stay. I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings......not #1 in Chicago, in my book."
134,244,"Dec 6 2008 	Best hotel ever!	I had a hard time finding a place to stay in Chicago because a very large conference was going on. The usual place I stay was booked up, so I got a room at the Sofitel.IT WAS AMAZING!The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. I didn't really need them besides checking in and checking out, but had no problems.The room is amazing. I was on the 32nd floor, which is the top floor. I didn't have a view of the Hancock tower but instead had a south-east view. I still loved it. I just had the standard king room. Great bathroom, great seating area with chair and sofa and coffee table, and AMAZING bed. The bed was the most comfortable bed you can imagine sleeping on.The bed has a feather top that is about 4-5&quot; thick with feathers/down. Then they have a down duvet on top of that. It's like you are in a sandwich of softness. I slept so well. I never heard any sound from the hallway or other rooms, and I was right by the elevators.The wireless internet was very reliable (T-mobile hot spot). If you don't have wireless, there is wired internet available in the room from the hotel. If you don't even have a computer, there is a business center with computers and internet access you can use for free.The restaurant is not like any hotel restaurant. I would be happy to go out to this restaurant for a nice date or dinner anytime. The breakfast was amazing! Expect to pay about $20 after tax and tip (which includes the main course, coffee, juice, and your choice of toast or a bread basket full of an assortment of french pastries and bread).I had dinner once in the hotel restaurant and it did not disappoint either! The atmosphere is great.The hotel is only 2 blocks from the Chicago/State red line, so very convenient. Cabs are always close by. You are just blocks away from Water Tower Place. Yet there is relatively little traffic outside the hotel. You couldn't ask for a better location.The turndown service with complimentary bottled water each night was welcome too. I guess if I was looking for something to complain about, there was no chocolate on the pillow. heheheheSeriously though, book this hotel. You will have an even more amazing trip in Chicago because of it."
135,244,"Dec 6 2008 	Excellent Business Hotel	I have been staying at this hotel a few times each year for a couple of years when I need to be downtown Chicago and must share with fellow travelers how spectacular this place is: excellent location, great staff, attention to detail, comfortable and luxurious rooms and bathrooms, hip lobby, fantastic food, wide screen TVs that are truly wide! It has become my home away from home. Highly recommend to fellow female (and male) fussy business traveleres."
136,244,"Dec 4 2008 	Thank You One and all	Simple as this Sofitel Water Tower is amazing. I know, we spent 7 nights in Chicago, 4 at Sofitel, 3 at James Hotel, Sofitel was less expensive and by far way ahead in every department. We knew it was a special place once we entered main door, not one single complaint. Our room on 30th floor was superb with every luxury imaginable. Room service has to be experienced to be appreciated, turn down service, complimentary water (we were charged 8 dollar at James) was lovely. All in all staying at this hotel made our trip, cannot recommend it highly enough. To the management and staff, congratulations and very well done. If I return to the wonderful city of Chicago there will be no other place for me."
137,244,Nov 23 2008	one of the very best hotels that we have stayed in	Now know why this is such a highly rated hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our four night break -to the extent that it could almost be classed as one of the holiday highlights. Normally we like a good buffet breakfast which comes as a brunch to newly arrived european timezoned travellers. However we were won over by the impeccably served breakfast menu especially the &quot;eggscellent&quot; deal and coffee is the best we have had in USA. The beds are probably the most comfortable hotel beds that we have ever experienced.
138,244,"Nov 21 2008 	Excellent hotel in every way	This is my second stay at the Sofitel here and it has been excellent both times. The staff are friendly, helpful and very efficient. The hotel is very well located, two minutes walk from the Water Tower, and with many rooms having great views of the city and lake. The building is beautiful and both the public spaces and guest rooms are stylishly decorated and comfortable. The restaurant and room service are excellent, and the bar manages somehow to have a good atmosphere despite seeming a bit of an aftertought in the corner of the ground floor. On top of it all, it's really good value: I've stayed at all the premier hotels in Chicago and this is not only my favourite but also the best priced."
139,244,"Nov 17 2008 	Fantastic location	Wonderful hotel in fantastic location. Ugg shop directly opposite. On the corner of Rush Street where there is plenty of bars and restaurants. Close to the shops, especially water tower shopping centre and the John Hancock Building. Easy to pop back to the hotel for a rest and drop off your bags! Very helpful staff on the door and at reception. Beautiful room and bathroom with added bonus of the most comfortable beds. We loved it and would definitely recommend to others and stay if we were to return."
140,244,"Nov 14 2008 	Wonderful Hotel	Big room, big bathroom, nice view, great service, comfy bed... what more could you ask for?"
141,244,"Nov 10 2008 	THE Best Hotel.Ever	Stayed October 2008 for 5 nights. I have had the privilege of staying at a number of hotels across the world, including fantastic hotels in Las Vegas, but I can honestly say this was one of the best hotels I have stayed in. Location, Location, Location - a very short walk to the Magnificent Mile (near the Water Tower Centre), which is next to the Hancock Centre. Everything was nearby including Jazz Clubs, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, the famous Pancake House and also convenience stores. Overall the location felt very safe and ideal for walking to restaurants and shops. You can walk to Water Tower Centre and Hancock Centre in 5 minutes, Navy Pier in 20 minutes and Wrigley Building in 20 minutes. The Room - A fantastic view of the Hancock Centre  ask for a high room when checking in. The beds were like a giant marshmallow, fantastically comfortable and the rooms were so quiet it was the best sleep I have had in a hotel (although I am not sure whether or not we had guests next door). Hotel Bar - Comfortable with a selection of beers, cocktails and food, although it is not as hip and lively as their website makes out.Service  This was second to none. First class including concierge, reception, and bar staff. In fact there were literally dozens of staff on hand to assist with anything including holding the main doors open for you.The only criticism was that the room keys constantly malfunctioned, denying entry to the room. Other guests experienced this too and I was told by reception it is because they become de-magnetised if held next to a mobile (cell) phone. Well this has not happened at any other hotel and I never carry my mobile phone when on holiday, so this was not the reason  so this is something for them to address.There is absolutely no question I would return to this hotel again. Finally, try the Segway Tour  absolutely brilliant fun to explore Chicago with a guide and at $70 for 3 hours it is great value."
142,244,"Nov 6 2008 	Sofitel is exceptionally Good	This hotel has great service and a breathtaking decor. It is within short walk to Michigan Avenue(Magnificant Mile). The beds are really comfortable and the rooms smelled and looked execeptionally clean.It was just a pleasurable stay.I am not a coffee drinker, but those who are, should know there is no coffeemaker in the room. Given everything else, this point truly is not worth mentioning.The conceirge referred us to Lawry's for prime rib, if you get that same recommendation, I advise you not to follow it. Lawry's has great service, but it certainly should not be in the steak business in Chicago."
143,244,"Nov 4 2008 	Very Nice A Bit Pricey	This was a great location to stay in Chicago. It was a first visit to the city for 4 days to see primarily architectural sites. The concierge was great, helping with restaurants, car rental, and transit information. Only one bad steer, pointing us to a pizza place that ended up with a 2 hour wait... no thanks! The bar is a great spot for to relax after a full day, but we did not try the restaurant. Lots of good options for food nearby. The room itself was very nice. Spacious, and from our 22nd floor east facing room, we had a great view of buildings along the Miracle Mile. We even could see the lake through a couple of gaps between buildings. We are very noise sensitive, but there was nothing to notice, as either our neighbors were quiet or well insulated.  Overall, it was a good choice, and while expensive, worth the price for all the bad stuff that didnt happen!"
144,244,"Nov 2 2008 	Swank Stay-cation Spot	My husband and I found the Sofitel to be very comfortable and luxurious for a one night &quot;staycation&quot; in Chicago. The room and bed were clean and super comfy. The staff was helpful and friendly, going out of their way to help us: one woman backtracked on her path leaving the elevator to turn around and push the 'up' button for us! About three people stood at the entry way to open the doors and wish us a pleasant day.I love the Sofitel's modern, boutique style, gorgeous flowers in the lobby and sofas that allow lots of people to sit comfortably without feeling like we're in each other's way. (Practical and gorgeous!) There was just a 15 min wait for Sunday brunch (which was surprising considering the number of people in the lobby), and the menu had something for everyone. The property is centrally located to walk to Michigan Avenue and lots of good restaurants. I definitely recommend the Sofitel to friends coming to Chicago."
145,244,"Oct 28 2008	sofitel chicago. staff appalling.	Given the price, uou would expect the Sofitel in Chicago to be a genuinely enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, the staff are rude and dismissive. The decor is profoundly unimaginative and slightly worn. The lay-out is badly thought through. It's a very very average hotel with an eye-watering pricetag."
146,244,"Oct 26 2008 	Great stay at the Sofitel Chicago	We just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. It was faboulous. Fine Linen, nice room with bigs windows, bathroom with a shower, flat TV. Check for the deals on the Sofitel website, we had 3 nights for the price of two !"
147,244,"Oct 22 2008 	Top Class Hotel in Top Class City	Loved everything about the place,Hotel is location a few blocks from Michigan Avenue, close enough to be in the heart of the City but just far enough to be away from the crowds.All the rooms have great views of the City and are extremely comfortable for a City break hotel, all have king size beds, huge flat screen TV, seating areas, large bathroom with separate shower.The restaurant is recommended for breakfast or dinner and Le Bar, which gets busy on a week-end, is a great place for a pre-dinner drinks or night cap. Take advantage of the free coffee to take away from the restaurant every morning which is on the bar.There are some great restaurants near by, MK was one of our favourites, but also recommended is the Chicago Chop House  be warned, starve yourself before going, the portions are huge. I would also ask to be in the downstairs restaurant as this has plenty of atmosphere as well as live piano.Chicago has plenty to offer all ages, here are a few I would recommend:Take a trip up the Sky deck in the Sears Tower ($15 approx)Take in the views from the Observatory within the John Hancock Tower ($18)Take the Speed dog Architectural Tour ($25) which does the sites on the Chicago River but also a 10 min speed boat ride of the bay offering great views of the City.Take a Tour bus ($29)Go to Lincon Park Zoo (Its Free)Visit the Field Museum ($11)Shall definitely visit again!"
148,244,"Oct 20 2008 	Very nice (I'm a fan of modern). Plus a fabulous brunch spot.	A couple of years ago I met some friends in the lobby and loved the space but this was my first stay at the hotel. The service was above average. For the folks at the front desk that knew what they were doing, they were very helpful. However, there always seemed to be a long line of guests and some of the front desk staff seemed like they were still in training and a little perplexed.The rooms are not huge, but very nice. Some smart, modern design throughout. Loved the remote curtains and shade. Very comfortable bed - although not so comfortable to warrant a listing in the book of Sofitel items for sale, which includes the ability to purchase the bed, comforter, pillows, etc. But hey, If you love it - you can buy it.My family lives in Chicago and they think that the brunch in the hotel restaurant is one of the best in the city. I haven't tried many others in Chicago, but it was a great brunch. French press coffee, fabulous bakery basket of croissants and pastries and great eggs benedict. If you have the time, it's well worth it and not too pricey."
149,244,"Oct 18 2008 	Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - Worst Service EVER	I have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly rated hotel. I had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift. When my parents arrived, they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly. My parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip.Additionally, my father had requested a non-smoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was non-smoking. When my parents got to the room it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches on the desk tabletop. When my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches - something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was non-smoking.NEVER AGAIN."
150,244,"Oct 11 2008 	Excellent	Excellent hotel, moderm bulding, friendly people in reception. Very good location just in front of the John Hancock, Water Tower and Magnificient mille. Rooms are very good, moderm and with everything you need for a business/pleasure trip. Free internet in the business center."
151,244,"Oct 8 2008 	This is one of the best Sofitels	I'd booked a luxury room through the hotel's website - there was nothing else on offer, but when I arrived it wasn't quite that luxury at all. Quite small, the plasma TV blocked the mirror behind it and you couldn't fully open the doors of the wardrobe because the bed was right up against it. But there was a small seating area and the bathroom was spacious and well equipped ( apart from no slippers). I asked if I could upgrade to another room, but the hotel was full. However, the concierge Dominique could not have been more helpful. After a bit of a search he found a room that had come free unexpectedly, which was much bigger with a seating area and more space. it was perfect. Throughout my stay he constantly asked if everything was ok and whether I was happy with the room. I was.I found the service in the hotel really good. Everyone was pleasant, helpful and very polite and really did try and make your stay a good one. The hotel is in a great location, just off the Magnificent Mile and looks fantastic, very futuristic with a great lobby and bar. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone staying in Chicago. Keep up the good work Sofitel"
152,244,"Oct 5 2008 	My favorite in Chicago	The Sofitel is beautiful, hip, and the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. They have true hi def televisions with a nice menu system, not just cheap flat panels pretending to be hi def. This might not matter to many people, but I like to watch a little tv and hate the sets and the service at most hotels. The bar is fun to hang out in. The service was without fault."
153,244,"Oct 4 2008 	'So-fabulous' is the Sofitel	Beautiful hotel, greatly located near all the shopping streets.Could not fault the service, cleanliness, room choice or comfort levels. I was on the 9th floor.. not such a great view but it really didn't bother me. The room was gorgeous: bright, clean, pure comfort, loads of wardrobe space, loads of toiletries, bathrobes, bose music system, flat screen tv, room safe &amp; 2 phones. Expansive room service menu too..but watch out for the statutory 18% tip and 3 dollar delivery charge, and when the food is delivered you're obliged to give the delivery guy something too! ;o( Expensive mini-bar too but is to be expected in such a hotel (5.00 for a soda!!) Overall a perfect stay..expensive but absolutely worth it.Hotel also offers a gym, business centre and great bar/restaurants and great concierge service...A top recommend - great for business or leisure.I would definitely stay there again!"
154,244,"Sep 26 2008 	Very high standard in a great location	Stayed here for three nights during September 2008 and thoroughly enjoyed it. The rooms were large, clean, comfortable and very well appointed - I especially enjoyed the huge HD flatscreen TV and the Bose Waveradio. The furnishings are to a high standard, lots of toiletries, bathrobes, towels - really everything you needThere are the usual facilities - we ate breakfast in the hotel only once and whilst it was of a very high quality and, again, superb service, it felt a little pretentious. So we walked 200 yds up Rush for something a little more Chicago.The hotel staff were to a fault courteous and helpful, nothing was really too much trouble. It's also a very attractive building located around 200m from the John Hancock centre on Michigan Avenue. Perfect for shopping, and only 250m from the Chicago CTA Red Line station so very easy access from O'Hare.Very highly recommended."
155,244,"Sep 25 2008 	A pleasant surprise...	We had booked the hotel based on the fact that it was no. 1 on tripadvisor. That said, neither of us were expecting it to be that great. We were wrong. It was a very nice hotel in a great location and the staff were lovely.The room was a good size, the bed was comfy and the bathroom was huge.The only real downside is that there's no free internet access so you have to go across the road to the ING Cafe or Starbucks."
156,244,"Sep 18 2008	Great location	This was a great hotel in a great location - around the corner from the Magnificent Mile and a short walk from the lake front. It's also near lots of great bars and restaurants.We stayed for my birthday and my lovely boyfriend had called in advance to request a special birthday cake (as I have food allergies). The chef produced a delicious chocolate cake without dairy or wheat - it was fabulous and made my day.We booked a suite, which was wonderful and a surprise for me - all facilities were as expected or better (great HD TV!). The bath in the suite deserves a particular mention - it was huge.On the downside, my boyfriend had booked via the Sofitel website and the deal he chose included a $250 Bloomingdales voucher and an extended checkout (until 4pm) on the last day. The hotel knew nothing of these (although we'd booked on their website) and we had to provide documentary evidence to prove that the extras were as booked. This left us with a bad taste. The lesson for others, take a printed copy of the details of your booking.Overall, a great hotel and holiday!"
157,244,"Sep 11 2008	Tryly excellent	There were staff everywhere, you did not need to open a door once. The location is impossible to beat in Chicago, and the hotel is very new. Front office staff were very pleasant. Don't let their occasional use of French words surprise you, most actually can't speak French. Furnishings are contemporary. The parking valet was prompt and courteous. hard to beat, but quite expensive. Spend a $100 more at stay at the four seasons for nicer rooms."
158,244,"Sep 11 2008 	Overrated	Booked the Sofitel Water Tower for its location. Arrived on a Saturday at 5pm and took about 10 minutes before we were served by a Front Desk staff. I was then told that the room wasn't ready and had to wait a further 15 minutes.The room was large enough, as was the bathroom and was clean, but it's the little details that the hotel misses. The bathroom doors are French double doors, so you have to open both doors to get in. Also, one of the doors is backed almost into the door of the room so much so that everytime I open the room door, I'm met with the door of the bathroom staring straight back at me.There are also no dimmer switches for the lights so when getting up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, you literally have to grope your way around.One evening, while I was getting ready to go out for dinner, the chambermaid knocked on the door and asked if I wanted a turndown service. I asked if she could come back in 15 minutes but was told that she couldn't as her shift had come to an end. So much for service!Internet connection in the rooms is also not free, which is a shame as I had stayed at the Four Seasons only 2 months prior to this stay, and for about $10 more a night, the experience was night and day.All in all, it was an ok stay, but it's unlikely I'll ever stay at a Sofitel again."
159,244,"Sep 9 2008 	Loved this hotel	I just loved this hotel. The room was clean, had all the amenities that I like, and just felt great to be in. The hotel is fun to walk around in. I liked the modern atmosphere and thought the lobby was one of the most stylish I have seen in Chicago. I think this hotel can only add to your Chicago experience. I have stayed at several hotels in Chicago and feel this one is my favorite for style and cleanliness. Also it is in a great location for shopping and going out to eat. Have fun!"
160,244,"Sep 2 2008 	We just love this place!	My wife and I recently celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary with a stay at the Sofitel and everything was very good. I had ordered chocoloate covered strawberries, a rose display and a card to be in the room upon our arrival and it was, with a split of champagne sent up with the compliments of the manager. We stayed in Suite 2308 and I highly recommend this suite - great views of Michigan Avenue, the Hancock Building and Lake Michigan, and since it's a corner there is another view of the city to the south. We paid $325 for the night and felt we'd received excellent value for our dollar. One problem was the mirrored door covering the closet space was off its track but I was able to fix it with little effort.We had drinks in Le Bar and a room service breakfast on the morning of our departure. The food, drinks and service in both instances were great. We had stayed here once before during the winter and like it then...we now look forward to making Sofitel our regular place to stay in the city. Merci Beaucoup Sofitel!"
161,244,"Aug 31 2008 	Nice but small rooms	My husband spent one night at the Sofitel in Chicago. We are both avid travelers and have stayed at a lot upscale hotels in our day. Although we did enjoy our stay there were a couple of things that we felt the Sofitel missed on. The room was very small for what we paid, there was no dresser to place our clothes in, our turndown service consisted of the bedsheets being folded back, and there was no pool on the property. We did enjoy the huge shower and the wonderful smelling amenities in the bathroom. Our breakfast was outstanding however $50 is still a bit steep for breakfast! Overall we would recommend the Sofitel if we ever had to stay again."
162,244,"Aug 29 2008 	Vive le Sofitel	An over-the-top staff, a bathroom bigger than some hotel rooms, a bed that looks and feels like a cloud, a theatre sized flat screen TV. Comfort, charm, cheap (200$ on early bird) - why would we ever stay anywhere else?"
163,244,"Aug 27 2008 	nice hotel	Very much enjoyed the hotel. Nice location. Easy access to all of Chicago. Was unhappy that the hotel advertises &quot;Internet access&quot; and then charges $10 per day, per user. With all of the lower grade hotels now offering free internet access, it seems petty that Sofitel is not only charging, but advertising &quot;internet access&quot; as if it is some kind of perk. I mentioned the charge to the reservationist and all she said was, &quot;I'll inform management.&quot; Maybe they should advertise telephone service too."
164,244,"Aug 27 2008 	Faultless	From the moment we arrived we felt like valued customers. Our room was on the 31st floor with views of John Hancock Tower and the lake. Everything was provided, both in the room and the bathroom including a UK/US plug adaptor. The place was spotless and eveything was great quality. We ate in the restaurant and used room service - both were excellent ,food and service. The staff were friendly, attentive but not intrusive. Nothing was too much trouble. It was my birthday during our stay and the hotel provided chocolate covered strawberries and a card for me. Another fantastic touch.Absolutely faultless in every way. Book this hotel and a make a great visit to Chicago very special."
165,244,"Aug 25 2008 	Unprofessional Behavior by Sofitel Security on Second and Third Shift	I was a guest of a friend at the Sofitel of Chicago, IL, where we had stayed from June 27 through July 1, 2008. On June 30, 2008, we were having drinks at the Sofitel Chicago LeBar when around 10:45 p.m. my friend got into a disagreemment with another patron. SECURITY WAS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. Then I heard the Security officer call for assistance from another Security Officer several times and he was no where to be found. All I know is where they found him, I guess he was apparently flirting or doing something not work related and the other Officer needed help. He screamed in front of all of us that the other Security Officer always ran away from his job and was always doing other things besides Security&quot;. I thought at one point the two of them were going to fight. Very unprofessional I think. The two Security Officers acted very unprofessional. Myself along with other patrons heard the whole thing. I think Security Officers employed by Sofitel should be doing their job. On several occasions that I have stayed at this hotel, when I needed assistance, Security is never around, or from what I have seen Security flirts way too much with hotel guests and always hanging outside. I am in town with my friend on several occasions and I think that this is unprofessional behavior for Security of such a presitage hotel like the Sofitel. It is giving the hotel a bad reputation.I don't think that this Security at Sofitel especially the ones that covers between 8 p.m to 2:00 a.m. know what the definition of security is. Tell them not to argue in front of hotel guest, not to flirt so much and definitely not to drink and sleep. They should always be on alert because Security should know they never know who is watching or listening to them. Or maybe this is what the Sofitel allows and do not care. I hope this is not the case."
166,244,"Aug 23 2008	Sold 4 star hotel in a 5 star location	This hotel is a solid 4 star hotel with rooms, bedding, toiletries, restaurant and bar being up to this level. The only aspect of the hotel not four star level is its location which I would give a solid 5 stars. It is right at the foot of the Rush Street scene with shopping, restaurants, bars, clubs, and the Magnificent Mile .The restaurant is ideal with adequate outdoor seating in a protected patio on a busy street so it is great for people watching. The hotel did have a health club but no pool. My only complaint with the hotel is that there is no complementary wifi in the rooms. You have to go through TMobil service and pay for access. I cannot understand why a such a great hotel tries to pinch a few extra dollars from its guests from wifi instead of just providing it for free like Motel 6 and low end hotels do. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a 4 star hotel in the center of the entertainment area of Chicago. Down the street are some really world class restaurants but they are always crowded. Try to go to Gibsons for a bone in Prime rib that is two inches thick. Also Carmines has wonderful , cheap and plentiful Italian food."
167,244,"Aug 20 2008 	Simply superb	My wife and I visited Chicago on the strength of recommendations from friends etc. We stayed here for 11 nights and it is a simply fabulous hotel. Very clean hotel, with friendly, unobtrusive staff. We had a great room with a great view of the Hancock building. Somehow we never got around to using Cafe Des Architectes even though it looked fantastic - there was so many great eating places nearby. Bar was great, and very popular too. It's easy to see why this hotel is number one. It's location for the beach, Michigan Avenue, the Pier was fantastic. We are definitely going back...!"
168,244,"Aug 16 2008 	Great place to stay	Very nice room - service was excellent - the staff are obviously well trained. The Consierge service was very helpful. The location is excellent if you want to be downtown near the city's major attractions. Only one block from the Mag Mile, Hancock Centre, Water Tower, etc. and only a short walk from a subway stop. We had a good room - 25th floor with a view of the Hancock Centre. Lovely decor throughout - fresh flowers in the lobby, clean and attractive. No pool, however the workout facility looked nice.The restaurant and bar are average - the prices were high. I would recommend, if budget-conscious, eating/drinking mainly at other locations.We would stay here again."
169,244,"Aug 14 2008 	Great place great location!	A 2-block walk from the Chicago Avenue stop on the red line, this location can't be beat. (Can ride all the way from OHare for $2!) Our 23d floor room gave us a bit of a lake view, &amp; the green roofs on neighboring buildings were also interesting. Room was nice size, all the amenites we expected (except no pool and didnt check the fitness stuff--enough walking to do around town!). Morning pastry basket at the 1st floor cafe seemed pricey at $14 until we tried to replicate it in the neighborhood. Hey, it's a French hotel and they get great French pastries, so why look elsewhere? From the hotel we walked to Merchandise Mart (interesting kitchen &amp; bath retailers), the excellent Frontera Grill, and took the free trolley to and from Navy Pier, where we rented bikes and rode along the lakeshore."
170,244,"Aug 13 2008 	A beautiful place	I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this property which had it ranked as #1 in Chicago. I got a king room overlooking Michigan Ave. The view was beautiful. The room was also impeccable. Nice and bright, very fresh and modern. I find it very hard to fault any Sofitel's. The service, attentiveness of staff, cleanliness and luxury are always top notch. Location was great, head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants. Straight ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise. A great place to stay, and much better value than Park Hyatt. I do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy, such as for the internet. When you are paying top dollar, a few inclusions would be nice."
171,244,"Aug 12 2008 	Incredible Hotel	Stayed at the Sofitel Chi for my Bachelor Party. Incredible room, reasonable prices, great location. Furhtermore, the service was second to none. Every wish granted.I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone visiting Chicago who wants a great North Side location close to all the best restaurants and bars."
172,244,"Aug 11 2008 	excellent choice	Back today from a 3 night stay at the Sofitel. This is an excellent choice in the centre of town. Great location for all the shopping on Michigan Avenue and an easy cab ride to all the other sights.We had a room on the 10th floor which didnt have stunning views but was more than adequate for our needs. Large comfy bed, large well equipped bathroom and all other mod cons with the exception of no iPod dock which is not a problem but worth knowing.Hotel was buzzy with good restaurant and great bar which is a destination in its own right.Would not hesitate to recommend this Sofitel for anyone looking to stay in Chicago and not necessarily wanting to go for the full on 5 star choice. That said, the service and facilities in the Sofitel are no less 5 star than any of the other top properties we have stayed in. Can't see why anyone would be disappointed with this choice.Only thing I wish I had known was how booked up the top choice restaurants get, particularly on the weekend. If you want to go to the likes of Gibsons, Joe's, Hugo's Frog Bar or Carmine's you should not leave it till you get to Chicago to make the booking if you want to eat at a sensible hour."
173,244,"Aug 9 2008 	One of the best stays at a domestic hotel ever!	My husband and I spent a special 20th anniversary at this Sofitel. Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations, and it was a most wonderful stay. Our room was a very nice size and the bed was incredibly comfortable and luxurious. Our room was immaculate, and there was a leather couch and chair to relax in as well as a handsome desk to use. The TV was a 40&quot; flat screen HD and it swiveled between the settee and the king bed areas. The Bathroom. WoW! There was a soaking tub, shower for two, SOFT towels and live ORCHID in a very luxurious marble bathroom. How about a soft robe and slippers to slip into... Heaven!Chicago experienced a killer heat wave when we were there, but coming back to our plush, cool and quiet accomodations was the best. We felt like Rock Stars.It just doesn't get better than the Sofitel!"
174,244,"Aug 6 2008	Cafe Des Architects is a great place for lunch!	We did not stay (yet) at the Sofitel, but were very pleasantly surprised by the way the lobby looked and the overall impression the hotel made. We did however have a really good lunch at the Caf Des Architects, which is in the hotel. We took the 'one plate / 4 mini-course lunch' which includes an appetizer, salad, main course and dessert of choice, all for a bargain. The food was truly excellent and being Europeans, we thoroughly enjoyed the modest portions. Excellent wines too, friendly service and everything classy styled. We promised ourselves, if we ever return to Chicago, to try the Sofitel."
175,244,"Aug 5 2008 	AMAZING service location amenities	My husband and I have very expensive taste in hotels, but booked this Sofitel based on Trip Advisor reviews, not on hotel class (like five-star, etc.) which is our usual criteria. This hotel was not the most expensive in the city, but definitely seemed the best - not lacking in luxury. This was our 10th anniversary vacation, and due to limited time, we decided to do city/shopping long weekend instead of tropical/beach resort. We were NOT disappointed! This hotel was in a great location right in downtown Chicago, we walked everywhere and only used a cab when I was wearing my sky-high heels or going to a place far away. Great restaurant in the hotel (Cafe De Architecture) was awesome for sitting outside for breakfast and dinner - food was wonderful (and again, we have very high expectations). The service from every person we dealt with was exceptional. Very courteous and happy to assist. Almost never had to wait for anything. The cleaning staff were practically invisible. I dont think we ever saw anyone in our hallway, but our room was immaculate whenever we got back from shopping. Room was very contemporary chic with amazing city view. Great restaurants to be found everywhere around our hotel, best shopping in the Midwest too."
176,244,"Aug 4 2008 	Always Fantastic at the Sofitel!	My friend Patty and I have stayed at the Sofitel and loved it. When it came time to make plans for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary last year and this year we chose to stay at the Sofitel. It is beautiful, clean, and the staff is helpful and friendly. You can walk to everything fantastic location! Candles always lit and burning in lobby (smells wonderful) Rasberry not over powering just right. Fresh beautiful flower arrangements in the lobby as well. Last year for our 16th anniversary they happend to have a suite available on the 16th floor and they upgraded us and gave us the &quot;royal treatment&quot; this year there was a wedding celebration but we were upgraded to a room with a great view! We will always stay at the Sofitel it is a great &quot;romantic get away&quot; and they truely make it a great experience. Thank you Hotel Sofitel see you in March of 2009 for our 18th anniversary celebration! Norine &amp; Brett King"
177,244,"Jul 30 2008 	The Sofitel was great	My wife and I just returned from a four day trip to Chicago and the Sofitel was wonderful. We had a suite in the 23rd floor and it was everything that I had imagined. We have stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and other upscale hotels. This was by far the best. It was super modern. We had flat screen televisions in each room. The King bed was the most comfortable hotel bed that we have ever slept in. When the Bose alarm clock went off, I didn't want to get up. They sent us two Voss waters and some truffles the first night. Everything was well done.The hotel is two blocks from the Magnificent Mile and everything that we wanted to see was a short walk or cab ride from the Sofitel. We will definitely be back."
178,244,"Jul 30 2008	Very good hotel but...	Good hotel, excellent location, very attentive staff. Everything up to scratch!But: the rooms are quite small, although the big windows help not making them claustrophobic. Also I found the lobby quite dark even during the day. True enough, it was very atmospheric, but it made it difficult to see properly!"
179,244,"Jul 26 2008 	Great place to stay	Wife and I took a quick weekend to Chicago last minute. Booked hotel thru one of the last minute travel sites at around $200 per night. The hotel is very chic and trendy. Room was extremely comfortable and clean. We had drinks in the hotels bar when we arrived. A little pricey but very enjoyable. The hotel is one block off Michigan Ave near the John Hancock building. We had breakfast right next door at Tempo and had a great breakfast before heading out for the day. Be prepared that Tempo only takes cash so plan ahead for that. All in all a great weekend trip to Chicago. Great shopping, great food and lots of fun. Bring lots of money and worry about how much you spent when you get home."
180,244,"Jul 26 2008 	Like everyone says...	Yes, like most reviews written here, it is the 'hippest' place to be staying while in Chicago. Now in all fairness, it is the only place I've stayed in Chicago..I hope to go back one day.My sister and her husband suggested to us that we stay here because of the rooms and location. Our welcome and exit wasn't the warmest I've encountered, but it was fast and routine. No issues. Rooms are tiny, but very nice. The washrooms are awesome! And location is everything. Who knew Chicago had so much to offer - I didn't. I fell in love with this city and would tell people of this hotel. A little expensive for what you get, but if you're looking to be in the heart of the city, this is it. We also ate breakfast at the Cafe des Architectes and it was delish. A little expensive, but well worth it."
181,244,"Jul 25 2008 	Simply excellent!	My wife and I have stayed here several times and it is always consistently excellent.The bellmen greet you like friends and the valet takes good care of your car.The lobby is attractive and modern. The receptionists are friendly, and this last stay, they upgraded us to better rooms for no additional charge!The rooms are gems. Clean, modern and attractive. Super-comfy beds with great comforter-sheets. Nice soft pillows. WORKING air condictioners (nothing is worse than when the A/C doesn't work) . Bathrooms are granite-lined, clean and attractive.All one block off Michigan avenue and all for about $300/night with the taxes.You can't beat it."
182,244,"Jul 23 2008 	All's Perfect @ Sofitel	Can't add much to the rave reviews; only can confirm to the fullest extent as to every positive previous review in all aspects with no negatives whatsoever! Do yourself a favor and spring for the suite. Can't vouch for the restaurant as there are so many great places within easy walking distance: Hugo's/Gibson's, Rosebud, Ditka's, etc., etc. but the bar was quite enjoyable for cocktails and people watching."
183,244,"Jul 15 2008 	Loved it!!	Stayed here as a treat to myself while in Chicago recently for a concert. I totally LOVED IT here!!When you called either the Front Desk or Room Service, the phone was answered with &quot;Hallo Mrs (Name)&quot; which was a great personal touch. Vanessa at the front desk, went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before I could book into my room. My room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious. I was on the 30th floor and the views were superb. We ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice. The doormen were great too and I wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me, so no snobbery there.Comfortable, cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom, the lights went on in the wardrobe (never seen that before!!), tv was HD ready and flat screen. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud - best sleep for a while.Would I stay here again?? Oh yeah!! No problem - just need to save up first!!"
184,244,"Jul 15 2008 	First Class Hotel!	This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The rooms were AMAZING, Bathrooms were first-class, and Service was impeccable. The location was perfect... walking distance to John Hancock Tower, Rush St, Michigan Ave., and Red Line Train Station. The price is a bit high, but I found a good online deal. I hardly ever write reviews, so I felt this hotel deserved my 5-star write-up."
185,244,"Jul 7 2008	More of the Best	Haven't had a better stay -- ever. I was sad to leave and that I couldn't stay for longer. What struck me first was the smell of the hotel, it was fantastic. In fact, I had to buy the candle to bring it home. They have a great gift shop and a fun hotel bar -- good signs.Ever detail was thought of and I recommend this hotel very highly to anyone that wants a breathtaking experience from the moment you walk in the door."
186,244,"Jul 7 2008 	Will Never Stay At Another Hotel Again	This was by far one of the best vacations I have ever been on. The staff at the Sofitel is amazing - from the front desk down to the housekeeping. I just loved every little touch that they added even down to the fresh flowers in the lobby. I honestly will never stay at another hotel again unless there is no Sofitel at my destination.The building is beautiful, the bathroom was gigantic (compared to other places). There was a bath and a shower. THe bed was the most comfortable bed ever and the room service in the morning never disappointed. I could go on and on but it was a magnificient stay and there is a cute little park across the street you should check out too"
187,244,"Jul 7 2008 	Absolutely Fantastic Hotel	Stayed for four nights at this amazing hotel. Booked a suite and what a surprise. Room was huge not to mention the bed! Had a pull out sofa bed in the sitting room, which I stayed on and I have never slept so well. Bathroom was huge with beautiful Hermes products. Turn down services every evening with comlimentary bottles of water. Staff were extremly helpful and friendly.The reception area was fantastic with fresh flowers everywhere, the smell of which would greet you at the door. Can honestly say was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and cannot wait to return. Fantastic location close to everything."
188,244,"Jul 3 2008 	MacLure's - London ON - Loved it!	My husband and I just got back from a 3 night stay at the Sofitel in Chicago. It is by far the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at (and we have stayed at a lot). All of the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The bathrooms were large, bright, and &quot;clean&quot;. The turn down service at night and bottle of water on each bed side table was a nice touch. We would defineitly recommend this hotel."
189,244,Jun 27 2008 	Remarkable Architecture	Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life. The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night's sleep I've ever experienced in a hotel. Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment. Sofitel is worth the extra $'s.
190,244,"Jun 18 2008	Very nice but not as nice as the London Sofitel	Just returned from 5 days at the Sofitel. Yes the beds are fantastic and the rooms are immaculate. Service was very good, but we have stayed at a Sofitel in London and the service there was superior. So, by comparison, we simply couldn't rave as others have. It may be because the London hotel was smaller. The front desk staff greeted you by name and knew what room you were in. When the lobby tea room closed, the front desk brought me tea to the computer room. They made a special effort which we did not see at the Chicago Sofitel. We found the doormen were certainly respectful and we were not dressed, but service on the door was not consistent. Most times we were opening the doors ourselves. No big deal, but just not perfect service.Again by comparison, the concierge service just was not as good. I think it was good service, but you didnt get the feeling that they really cared. One in particular could barely crack a smile. However, housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful.The location is very good, but again, not perfect. We found we were always travelling to the theatre district, the Millinium park area, so would have preferred a hotel more central on the Magnificent Mile area. That said, it was close to restaurants ."
191,244,"Jun 11 2008 	Fabulous	I can't really say anything about this hotel that hasn't been said before. Simply fabulous. It was the attention to detail that impressed myself &amp; my husband most. The automatic soap dispensers, the free internet access and the fact that the maid came into our room while we at dinner to straighten up to name but a few.We ate at the Cafe des Architectes and were very impressed. Delicious food which was reasonably priced for the quality. Great service too.If you fancy eating out there are some great restaurants very close...Pancakes to die for, great fish at Hugo's Frog House and a very unique experience at Giordanos pizza place. We saved hard to stay at this hotel and it was worth every single penny."
192,244,"Jun 5 2008 	Fantastic - Be Prepared to Ooooh and Aaaaah	The Sofitel Water Tower is simply fantastic. I have traveled extensively throughout Europe and the U.S., and I can easily say this is one of the best hotels at which I've ever stayed.The experience starts even before you enter the gorgeous lobby with its contemporary glamor. Whether you arrive by car, cab, or by foot, the doormen at the Sofitel are there to offer you exemplary service, greeting you cordially and opening doors. On Mother's Day, they even hand out pristine roses with thorns removed! I cannot say enough to adequately describe how top notch the service is at this hotel! And yes, while the interior - everything from the lobby, your room, the bar and the restaurant - is stunning and will delight you...the service is what will really blow you away here. Stay here. You will not regret it.Finally, a note regarding some of the negative reviews on this hotel, specifically those who claimed the doormen were &quot;snotty&quot; or &quot;stuck up:&quot; I simply didn't see it. That is not to say it never happened, for I wasn't there to witness anything. All I can say is that my mother and I stayed here for Mother's Day weekend and we dressed comfortably in jeans...and yet we were treated with every bit of respect as businessmen in their suits. So from my perspective, the service was uniformly wonderful at the Sofitel Water Tower."
193,244,"Jun 3 2008 	Wow! Cannot fault it at all...	I cannot give this hotel enough praise - it has to rank up there with some of the best hotels I've ever stayed with.We stayed there for 3 nights (May 8th - 11th) and had an incredible experience. Firstly the hotel is amazing architecture from the exterior and you are wow'ed as soon as you pull up to it.The reception/lobby/bar area is very spacious and grand, it is all so chic and contemporary inside it's gorgeous. In the evening and and night they light scented candles throughout the lobby which smell divine.Our room was on the 23rd floor (room 2311 I think) and it was perfect, we had a central view of the impressive John Hancock Centre straight in front of us and could see the top of the gorgeous old Water Tower too. The room was a generous size, with a generous size bathroom and it was all decorated to the highest contemporary standard. We had a chaise lounge and a flat screen TV too. The best part of the room though has to be the bed. I have never slept in a more comfortable bed in my life, it was amazing.The hotel itself has a great location, it's just a few minutes walk from the John Hancock Centre and the Magnificent Mile. I was a bit concerned after reading a couple of negative reviews that the staff were snooty if you didn't dress the right way or look monied. We are just 2 regular 30-somethings who dress very casually in jeans and t-shirts and we had just got in from an 8 hour flight so didn't look great. The staff were very friendly and pleasant and they were throughout our stay, very helpful and pleasant.It's excellent value for money for such a high-class standard of hotel. I have relatives that live in the Chicago area and they have friends and family who have stayed in other 'major' hotels which are more costly and a lesser standard than this. They rate the Sofitel Water Tower very highly too.Book it, you won't be disappointed. See the photos for all the evidence you need."
194,244,"May 23 2008 	My best experience in Chicago hotels	This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Chicago. I've also tried Amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown. This one was the best. Great service, beautiful room, roomy bathroom, top-notch amenities."
195,244,"May 23 2008 	I love the Sofitel!	I cannot say enough good things about this property. The hotel is attractive, my room was very nice and the hotel fitness center was top-notch. I ordered room service breakfast during my stay and it was one of the best room service experiences I have ever had...the food was amazing! The hotel uses Frette linens and towels which are very plush because they have a very high thread count. I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud! The hotel is located a couple blocks from all the shopping on Michigan Avenue so it is an ideal location for a business or leisure trip to Chicago."
196,244,"May 22 2008	Fantastic Sofitel	I have just returned from a three night vacation to Chicago and it would be fair to say that this hotel is one of the best I have ever stayed in. From the moment of our arrival we were made to feel welcome. Our flight got us into Chicago and to the hotel by 11am, so we really just expected to drop our bags off and go out for the day. We were able to get into a room straight away- and not only that one with a great view of the Hancock Tower from the 20th floor. The concierge were helpful throughout, offering advise on how to reach certain attractions, and were more than happy to book restaurants/tours for us on our behlaf. We had also ordered baseball tickets to be delivered to the hotel in advance of our stay, which were held on our behalf by the hotel, and we got them upon check in without a problem.The rooms themselves were fantastic. They were exceptionally clean and modern, and they felt so new it was as if we were the first to stay in them! The bed and shower were the best I have ever had in a hotel stay without question.We ate at the hotel restaurant one night, and the food was of good quality, and again, excellent service, which was the recurring theme of our three night stay.Great central location. Couldn't ask for anything more. We booked direct with the hotel for the best rate. Definately recommended."
197,244,"May 18 2008 	I adored this hotel!	The Sofitel Water Tower was a splurge, but so worth it! All the great reviews on TripAdvisor inspired me to stay here during a February 2008 trip to Chicago, and I am so glad I did. This is absolutely the most comfortable hotel I ever stayed in. It had the coziest bed, with down pillows and comforter, an HD flatscreen tv, plush bathrobes, and a lovely marble bathroom. I was so comfortable that I didn't want to leave. I also found the customer service to be exceptional. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and attentive."
198,244,"May 17 2008	Solid professional service for business	We hold numerous 2-day meetings a year, all over the U.S. at premium venues. For this group's Spring 2008 meeting I thoroughly researched the downtown Chicago meeting &amp; conference hotel market, before selecting the Sofitel. Our group of 12, including 8 CEO's, thorughly enjoyed the Sofitel experience. The meeting and banquet staff did a great job responding to our needs, and rooms were perfectly comfortable, clean and quiet. Food for private breakfasts, breaks and lunches was 5-star quality. Bell staff and Concierge handled special requests unhesitatingly and competently. When we returnn to Chicago we'll go back."
199,244,"May 16 2008 	Top Class hotel ; lovely experience in Chicago	This is one of the best downtown hotel that I have ever stayed which is top class and business friendly. I have stayed here twice so far this year and all I can is, you just wont go wrong for selecting this wonderful hotel for corporate events or personal leisure trips. Staffs are really friendly and all the business facilities it offers are really good. The restaurant manager last time offered me a complimentary breakfast for having to wait 5 or 6 min extra for table on a busy Sunday morning. Hotel is great for leisure hunters or shopping enthusiasts as it is just 1 minute away from the heart of magnificent mile. Since I'm a eco-friendly travel enthusiast, last time I found that the CTA metro station is just 2 min walk from the hotel (Brown line  Chicago avenue station which comes north bound from the Loop) Room facilities are great, great bed, quality toileteries and loved those HD channels playing on the large 36' lcd TV.And, for all those who are a bit nipping type and love to read negative comments, yes I can write one in your favor too. This hotel does not have a pool and I really dont see that as major drawback because you are staying in downtown and there are many better activities yards/blocks away in my view than relaxing in a pool. Whole heartedly would recommend to anyone!"
200,244,"May 14 2008 	Unconfortable hotel.	Front desk was cold and unfriendly. My room had a stained carpet and was very small. When I informed the front desk I was unhappy, they moved me to an even smaller room (with a smaller tv) that DID have a cleaner carpet, but was located next to the maid's closet. Needless to say, I had to listen to the housekeeping staff going into their storage room all night and day.The room was small, generically decorated, and poorly designed. The lobby is also small and seems stuck in the early 90s. Bartender was surly and unfriendly. I will never stay there again."
201,244,"May 8 2008 	Business elegance	We decided to stay here partly because of Tripadvisor No 1 position and partly because of good room price deal (300 USD per night).It is a nice, big hotel and as you would expect from Sofitel more fancy oriented. Rooms are large with very (really very) comfortable bed and HD plasma TV though a bit soulless.On the first night we ate at Cafes des Architectes and it was very pleasant experience, tuna was amazing and I would definitely recommend eating there at least once. We were there for breakfast too and food was nice but it seemed to me that they were understaffed; waiting for breakfast could have been a little bit shorter (it is not buffet, you have to order everything).There is a diner next to the hotel called Tempo, we havent been there but all the time people were waiting in the line to get in so maybe it is worth trying eat there at least for breakfast.Hotel is full of business people even on the weekends and hotel has very strong business feeling, it seemed to me that this is perfect hotel for businessmen who would like to feel that they are at very stylish place.On the arrival there was no bell boy or anybody waiting for us (we came at around 9 p.m.) but all on all other days there were really many staff people taking care of doors and taxis incl your bags.Gym is on smaller size and if you arrive at around 7a.m. it can be full (happened to me once). Equipment is top quality though.It was funny how everyone in Chicago reacts with admiration when you say that you are staying in Sofitel.Overall it was pleasant experience and we would stay there again."
202,244,"May 5 2008 	Wonderful Experience in a Terrific Location	We recently returned from a 3-day weekend at Chicago's Sofitel Water Tower. Here are our observations:Positive:1. The hotel is located in the very upscale, beautiful Gold Coast of the city, two blocks from Michigan Avenue, and also a few blocks from the beach. 2. Every aspect of every management and employee-level worker at the hotel was professional, gracious, friendly and accommodating to a fault. 3. The hotel interior is beautiful, modern and elegant without any hint of excess or phony snobbiness. 4. Our room (27th floor) was spacious, extraordinarily clean, and ethereally quiet. We had a view of the city and Lake Michigan. The bed was by far the most comfortable we've ever experienced, and the marble bathroom with separate shower was purely decadent. All of the usual luxury-level hotel amenities were provided, including the usual toiletries, a very powerful hair dryer, robes, slippers, iron, ironing board, fully-stocked minibar, large electronic safe, 40&quot; flat-screen TV, a desk with hookups for internet, etc.5. Some niceties were provided upon our arrival, including a cheese platter, fruit, chocolates, and bottled water.6. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architectes) provided wonderful service and abundant , 5-star food. Our room came with breakfast included. When we opted to have only coffee one morning because we had brunch plans elsewhere, we received a $30 credit on our hotel bill for not eating, a very thoughtful (and virtually unheard of) gesture.7. The bar (Le Bar) was also very accommodating for late-night drinks, food and desserts. It was crowded and hopping until 2am nightly, yet we got a table and fast, friendly service both visitsNegatives:1. There was no coffee-maker in the room. We were quite surprised at this, considering the plethora of other amenities offered.2. Contrary to what we were led to believe, the hotel charges $10/day for internet access.3. No daily newspaper was provided.The biggest negative of all was that we only got to stay for two nights at this terrific hotel. You can spend a lot more at other hotels in the neighborhood (Peninsula, Four Seasons, etc.) but I'm not sure how much better the accommodations or service could possibly be to merit the additional charge. The Sofitel Water Tower was one of the finest hotels we've ever had the good fortune to stay at in the world."
203,244,"Apr 27 2008 	Loved this hotel	My husband and I have stayed at several hotels in Chicago over the last few years (the Renaissance on Wacker, Westin Michigan Ave, and Hotel Monaco) and the Sofitel is definitely our favorite. The beds at this hotel are amazing (I didn't want to leave in the morning!), our room was comfortable,clean, and bright, and the bathroom was very spacious. The lack of a coffeemaker was perhaps a slight inconvenience, but honestly, it's Chicago -- there's a Starbucks on every other corner.The location is within walking distance of many restaurants and shops (only a block and a half away from the Ghirardelli chocolate shop -- a great plus for any chocoholic :)), including all the craziness of Michigan Avenue. We found the staff to be very friendly and polite. The only problem we encountered was a miscommunication between the front desk and the valet one morning when we wanted to pick up our car. Somewhere between our call to the front desk and the front desk's call to the valet, our request for our car was lost and we ended up standing outside for several minutes, wondering if the valet had lost our car. But as soon as we returned to the front desk to inquire about the delay, we were offered an apology and the valet rushed our car out to us very quickly. No harm done, and it certainly didn't tarnish our view of the hotel.All in all, a great hotel, and we'll definitely return the next time we're in Chicago!"
204,244,"Apr 17 2008 	Nicely-lighted rooms snotty staff	Sofitel Chicago is a great place to stay, if you dress and act like a well-to-do European. Think twice if you like to wear casual clothes or are of small stature, or a person of color. The rooms here are nice- I liked the huge window that covered one wall, and the color schemes of warm beige, that are calming and comfy. Also, the restrooms are roomier than the typical hotel, and has a separate bath and shower.The service? Well, I definitely felt the staff could have been a lot nicer. Most staff that I interacted with were very stiff and snotty. There is no warm greeting from front desk nor smiles from doormen. Several times, the doormen would ignore my presence and fail to open the door for me, although they saw me nearing the hotel doors. I stayed at the hotel for a week, so I ended up opening doors for myself numerous times. The doors themselves are very inconvenient if you are handicapped or old, as they are very narrow and heavy double doors."
205,244,"Apr 16 2008 	Perfect	Stayed one week in March. Perfect hotel, very friendly and helpful staff, great location. Hotel and rooms stylish and well kept. Very quick check in and out, staff always asked if i wanted a taxi whenever i was walking out. Would not even consider another hotel if i was going back to Chicago. My only complaints would be the room didnt have a coffee maker or microwave, but that's the extent of it. Room ordered stated wifi access, but this costs $10 a day, and there is an RJ45 on the desk which also cost $10/day. Slightly misleading wording when booking about internet access"
206,244,"Apr 14 2008 	Highly Recommend the Sofitel	Just spent two nights at the Sofitel and had a fabulous stay. Immaculately clean room, contemporary/comfortable style, plenty of space for two guests in one room, city view. My favorite thing: quietest room I've ever stayed in!! Complete silence. Housekeeping didn't knock on the door or bug us in any way. When we left for a while, we let them know and we came back to a nicely refurbished room.Room service food was excellent and promptly served. Flat screen TV was a plus as we decided to stay in one night and watch a movie.All in all, a wonderful stay in a perfect location for a reasonable price."
207,244,"Apr 12 2008 	Great hotel	As a hotelier, I have to say it was one if the best hotels I have stayed. Nice blend of contemporary and classy design. The rooms were clean in design but still had a warm feel to it, and were also large for a city hotel. The service was great - experienced the Fron office, the bar and the a-la carte breakfast restaurant. Staff were friendly and professional. Also, I loved the flower decoration in the lobby. Look forward to the next stay!"
208,244,"Apr 6 2008 	Loved it - could very easily move in!	We stayed at the Sofitel for a week in March after reading all the reviews on trip advisor. I'm happy to report that almost everything was perfect! The bed (mattress &amp; pillows) were probably the most comfy ones i have ever slept on!! Bathroom was large and power shower was superb. I appreciated the 24hr gym with the tv screens fitted to all the cardio equipment, and the free fresh fruit (apples &amp; bananas) in the gym was a nice touch. The &quot;turn down&quot; service in the evening was also a nice gesture - bottle of evian water each, and re-making of the bed. The &quot;business centre&quot; downstairs with free internet access came in very handy. The staff at the front desk and doormen were generally very helpful and friendly. There were only 3 faults i could find. The first (minor one) was that housekeeping only left enough shower gel/shampoo for one person daily even though there were two of us in the room! The second was that heating was controlled by a vent which was a bit noisy, so needed to turn off the heating at night or else the noise from the vent would keep you awake. The room still remained reasonably warm though. And the third, most significant one, was that their restaurant downstairs, had virtually no vegetarian options for breakfast or evening meals!! However, we found an excellent vegetarian restaurant about 10 min walking distance called &quot;Karyn's Cooked&quot; on 738 N Wells Street. The food was so amazing we ended up having most of our meals there! Overall, i would definitely recommend staying at this hotel, and will stay again the next time i'm in chicago!"
209,244,"Mar 29 2008 	Sofitel delivers	Recently spent a night at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower -- very nice hotel in a great location, beautiful building, nice room, nice view, nice bathroom. Everything worked. Prices were not bad, either in the bar or the restaurant -- and the continental breakfast featured fabulous French style pastries. All in all, this is a well priced, well run hotel. Would definitely stay again..."
210,244,"Mar 24 2008 	Worst Hotel For The Money	I never write these reviews, but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the #1 2008 travelers choice. Terrible Service, Lazy Doormen/bellmen/concierge/valet, Lack of Respect, allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints, Phantom charges to room, front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus. The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son, and the doorman watched on doing nothing. Me and my girlfriend are young, look young in how we dress, but in all honesty make more money than most...and we were treated like cheap poor kids. I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up, the concierge exclaimed that, &quot;You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr. Blank?&quot; Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star $200/person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young? Very Dissapointed. Very nice looking, comfortable beds, great room service, contemporary, younger crowd, but service was terrible."
211,244,Mar 24 2008 	Excellent experience	My husband and I spent one night at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. We wished we were staying in town longer because the hotel was excellent. Our room and bathroom were very nice. The bed was very comfortable and was made with very nice linens. We had no issues with noise and slept very well. The hotel staff was very accomodating and friendly. We strongly recommend this hotel and will stay here again.
212,244,"Mar 23 2008 	First class!	My first stay at the Sofitel Water Tower last week. The room was beautiful, very stylishly decorated, enormous TV set. Service was good, staff very helpful. Definitely recommend to others."
213,244,"Mar 22 2008 	Disappointing	What a disappointing experience! For my money, I could have gotten a much better value at another hotel. First, even though it is only two blocks west of Michigan Avenue, it is almost in the middle of nowhere. No interesting restaurants, bars, or shops. Luckily, there is one good breakfast place on the same block - Tempo's. Eat breakfast there; you'll love it. Skip the hotel's breakfast offerings and head to Tempo's.Check in was quick and uneventful.Our room was on the 22nd floor and had a nice view of the Hancock. But the only downside of the room was this nasty noxious cleaning spray housekeeping uses - and they visit your room twice a day. Each time we'd enter the room, this poisonous cloud of orange smelling cleaning would attack our senses. If we had stayed longer, I would have probably called down and asked for our room not be to cleaned.Oh, this is the reason I'll never stay there again: $9.95/day internet access. [-] T-Mobile access that you have to constantly log back in to.The beds were comfortable, but the robes were not.Turn down service was a nice touch, especially with the water bottles - but the staff turned the A/C off and our room was swelltering when we returned to it.Two people cannot fit into the shower, so don't try it.We won't stay there again, mostly because of the whole internet issue."
214,244,"Mar 15 2008 	A true Luxury stay...	I had heard about this property so much before staying and usually you are always a bit disapointed after.... But with this one it just lived up to my expectations....I stay in a Deluxe Room which is much bigger than the standard (worth upgrading for a few more bucks).... THe room had a brand new flat screen TV, great Sofitel feather Bed .... great view as well stayed on the 32nd floor.... The restaurant is just one of the best in town I would definitaly recommend it, and has great brunch during weekends.... The hotel looks like it just opened and is very much in shape we can see that everything is looked at very carefully....And last but not least you are just 2 blocks away from michigan avenue and all its shops.... great location..."
215,244,"Mar 10 2008 	Fabulous hotel right near the miracle mile	I decided to stay at the Sofitel because it was ranked #1 in Chicago on tripadvisor and it certainly lived up to expectations. The room was not big but it was clean, sophisticated, the linen was very high quality, the baby crib was setup when we arrived with lovely linens. The bathroom was big with a very large shower and nice toiletries.Highlights were;The breakfast - beautiful pastries and the eggs benedict with crab cakes was amazingThe coffee in the car when the valet delivers it to you - a very nice touchThe concierge staff printed out the mapquest directions for us a couple of times for events we had to attend in the suburbsAll the staff were helpful and very nice.I booked online with the hotel direct and got a decent rate because I booked a couple of weeks in advance."
216,244,"Mar 10 2008 	Even the cleaners smiled	Our best hotel experience for five years! OK, so we went out of season, so there was little pressure on the staff, but everyone, and I mean everyone, including the many, discreet, cleaners, gave you a smile.The room was very well equipped - as well as a generous sized shower and bathroom, there was the latest 42 inch HD plasma TV to enjoy while on the super comfy bed.The one downside was the restaurant, where service was a little slow and the food not great value (surprising for a French-owned establishment).But the clincher was the great doorkeepers. In even the most freezing weather, they showed unfailing courtesy and helpfulness. Other hotels would do well do try some mystery shopping at the Water Tower to find out how it should be done."
217,244,"Mar 8 2008 	would stay again	Stayed for one night. Easy to access by train and underground from airport, only $2, stop at chicago and walk 1 block.Staff in reception pleasant and helpful. large reception lobby pleasant with restuarant, didnt eat there. Had breakfast (as cheaper ) at Diktaas just next block.Room very clean, smart with large very comfortable bed and HDTV.Easy walk to hancock tower and michican ave, very central for seeing sites.would stay again"
218,244,"Mar 8 2008 	Comfortable and modern	I booked this hotel via the hotel website as it had the best deal on the internet. I was expecting a very high standard considering the website and the masses of positive reviews on TripAdvisor. It's situated very well: short walks to the main shopping areas and great bars/restaurants (gold coast). It is a very modern and clean hotel with an impressive lobby, albeit very dark and glossy! The room did not &quot;wow&quot; me and my friend when we checked in. Having paid over $950 for 3 nights (room only) I was expecting a larger more luxurious room. For two girls sharing, there was not enough room for all our luggage. Having said that the bathroom was immaculate with a great fog free mirror, the bed was extremely comfortable and nice touches such as Evian water at turndown was nice. The decor was modern, clean and tasteful with a cool chaise longue in the corner of the room. We used the room as a base, so didn't see much of the hotel, apart from the very small bar for a quick drink one evening. (Lots of city type customers and extremely noisy). As a Brit abroad I miss having the opportunity to have a hot drink in my room first thing in the morning and at bedtime, and I refuse to pay room service prices for a cup of tea or coffee. But Starbucks are a plenty! We did ask the concierge for some advice on things to do inside (as it was bitterly cold) and some of the information was not correct, with regards to museums etc. I would advise checking the websites of museums and art galleries before you travel. It will save you unnecessary taxi rides and long walks! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. It does what is says on the tin! After having completed an online hotel questionnaire I was emailed directly by the manager with regards to the room size and have been offered an upgrade on my next stay. Its worth telling hotels what you think of them as soon as possible, so they can rectify problems quickly and keep you as a future customer. One further piece of advice for British travellers - if you plan to present your debit card at check-in, the hotel will want to take a refundable amount off your card. They wanted to charge me $1000 for a 3 night stay, which left me reeling (and also short of a lot of spending money!) Fortunately the check in staff only charged me the minimum of $125. Not everyone wants to pay by credit card, so please be aware of this rule when using debit cards."
219,244,"Mar 7 2008 	What A Great Staff!!	Everything was outstanding, but the attitude of the staff was over the top. At our rate of $185, we thought it was a tremendous value. We'll stay there again."
220,244,Mar 6 2008	Perfect in many ways	This is my favourite business hotel hands down! Stayed here many times. Wonderful location and food. Once had the stomache flu and had to stay at the hotel instead of attending meetings....I couldn't have been happier. The beds are so comfortable it's hard to get up. Ask for a corner room....the bathrooms are bigger and nicely appointed.
221,244,Mar 3 2008	Perfect for Romantic Getaway	My husband and I went to Chicago for a 4 night weekend.I booked directly with the hotel after I had exhausted all other online opportunities. I got the best deal by calling directly.The hotel is 2 blocks from the Magnificent Mile so it's quiet but close to everything. The staff were exceptional. I asked for an upgrade when we arrived and they gave us one. The room (King deluxe) was a good size and the bath was lovely - very separate and private from the rest of the bedroom. The bed is exceptionally comfortable. Room service was outstanding - breakfast in the room every morning.We would definitely stay again and would use Sofitel in other cities.
222,244,"Mar 1 2008 	Snobitel	We stayed one night at the end of January. The woman at the front desk answered a phone call in the middle of checking us in and basically dismissed us after that. I tried to ask a question and was blown off. The room however, was beautiful with a fantastic bed. The location is also wonderful, we could see the John Hancock Center from our room. The dessert in the hotel restaurant was also fantastic. The chocolate/Grand Marnier combo was one of the highlights of the trip. Our experience in checking out was a little bit better, but still not warm and friendly, hence the name &quot;Snobitel&quot;."
223,244,"Feb 27 2008 	Positive Overall	This wasn't the greatest hotel I've ever stayed in, nor was it the worst (not even close). The only disappointment I had, and I think my friend felt the same, was that our room was dinky. That, and there was no coffee maker in the room, which isn't a huge problem with a Starbuck's every block, but she's English and would have enjoyed her nightly tea! I also like to start my day with coffee and would rather not pay $12 for a pot from room service. The beds were excellent and the room was quiet, the tv was better than average for our pre-sleep viewing, and it was always nice to come back to the room to find the bed nicely turned down and a bottle of Evian at the bedside. I would stay here again, but I would hope to get the room cheaper next time through one of the discount sites. Only other complaint was being told at concierge services that all of the city's museums were free for the month of February, then after taking a $20 cab ride to The Museum of Science and Industry, we were told we had to pay the entry fee. Not a big deal until we found out afterward they were closing in 45 minutes. Lesson learned: Always double check what a concierge tells you."
224,244,"Feb 22 2008 	Nice Hotel Nice Location	We stayed at the Sofitel for a week in October '07. Its location is great (not noisy, short walk to Michigan Avenue &amp; subway station). The staff were polite and the concierge service was excellent. Our room was a double with very comfortable beds. Not large but not small either (Nice Comforters, Huge Window, Very Nice Bath, Well Decorated). The hotel's bar was small but well appointed (I'm from Cal and not used to smoking allowed in bars). The lobby is huge and very chic. We didn't try the hotel restaurant but plenty of places around town and the cafe (can't remember the name) on the same block on the corner was nice and homey. Overall, the Sofitel was a great pick and we had no complaints. I'd recommend it to a friend without reservations."
225,244,"Feb 19 2008 	Nice Stay	Recently stayed a long weekend at the Sofitel Water Tower with my partner. The staff was really great and overall we enjoyed our stay. I would stay there again. However, some of the small details that set hotels apart were not always taken care of. I'm Sofitel Privilege member and typically get some in room perks (wine, etc.) upon arrival. This did not happen here. Not a big deal though. The one issue was the lack of hot water in the shower. We mentioned this, but it appeared there was nothing the hotel could do. If you sleep in, your out of luck. We got a great rate on this hotel and its really in a prime location. Nice rooms, nice views too on the upper floors. Great breakfast in the hotel cafe. I highly recommend it. Be aware the north-bound red line subway is not operating right now due to construction."
226,244,"Feb 16 2008 	Took care of problem. A+ stay	I stayed at the sofitel for business and upon arriving tired and late my reservation could not be found. I had booked my stay with a hotel reservation site instead of the hotel itself and even though nothing could be found, I was able to get a room at the rate I said I was being given. The hotel manager followed up with me about the problem after I was back home just to make sure everything felt good. So much for either of the &quot;W&quot; hotels or other places I normally stay while in Chicago...Sofitel, with it's great location, dynamite beds and luxury bathrooms is my new home in the windy city."
227,244,Feb 6 2008 	Loved It!	I have stayed in many Accor hotels around the world and this certainly tops them all. My room was outstanding - extremely comfortable and well appointed. The bed was amazing - so comfortable. Great bathroom as well. Staff were always courteous and efficient. Location was perfect. Highly recommended!
228,244,"Jan 29 2008 	Wonderful hotel!	We loved our stay at the Sofitel Water Tower Chicago. My husband and I wanted to stay somewhere near downtown and walking distance to different sights. The hotel was located just a couple of blocks from the John Hancock building and close to Michigan Avenue and shopping. The hotel and rooms were very clean and never saw any of the cleaning staff in the hallways while we were there. There was always a complimentary bottle of water next to the bed each night. Very nice touch. Also we read a comment about the candles being lit in the lobby everyday and how nice it smelled, well it was the same while we were there too. We would stay here again and recommend it to others."
229,244,"Jan 27 2008 	Perfect in so many ways	We took the Amtrak train into Chicago departing from the Milwaukee Airport station. First, I must highly recommend this as a way of getting to Chicago. The train ride was quick and easy. Once you are in Chicago, cab rides are fairly inexpensive within the city and it was great not having to deal with the traffic, getting lost, and finding parking or gas involved with driving into the city yourself. We arrived to the Sofitel Water Tower very early and I was worried that our room would not be ready, but to my suprise, we were able to go straight to our room on the 32nd floor (top floor!) right away at 9 am. We had an amazing view of Downtown Chicago and even Lake Michigan. The bed was extremely comfortable, and with the curtains tightly closed we were able to sleep in late, very comfortably. Steps away was the luxurious bathroom that I am missing already, only 8 hours later! We spent a lot of time just relaxing in the suite and enjoyed the large LCD tv. We had sushi delivered from Kamahachi and it was great. Not as great as our favorite sushi place, but great that it was delivered right to our suite! The Sofitel was a nice walk from Michigan Ave, and with a pleasant suprise in warm weather, in the 30's, we were brave enough to shop a bit. I can also recommend the restaurant Caf des Architectes as a great place for breakfast. The french toast and fingerling potatoes were perfect! Room service breakfast the next morning was just as perfect as it was downstairs. I can see why this hotel is rated as #1 and I will probably always stay at this hotel when I return to Chicago. In fact, I will be sure to check for a Sofitel Hotel in any other city that I travel to. Perfect in so many ways!"
230,244,"Jan 26 2008	Sofitel was lovely!	I agree with all the other reviews. This hotel was beautiful and service was fantastic in all respects! Prices were high but the value was very good. We stayed there in a beautiful, modern suite on a &quot;romance package&quot; --this included dinner at the excellent Cafe des Architectes. As part of the package, they waived the entire dinner charge for our family of 4, including tip! We would definitely stay there again."
231,244,Jan 25 2008 	New Tradition	I stayed at this hotel last year (2006) with my Mom for some holiday shopping. We enjoyed our stay so much and found the location to be perfect that we came back again in 2007. The rooms and service are wonderful. I live in Chicago and have made it a tradition to stay downtown with my Mom for a night and Christmas shop on Michigan Ave. The location is truly perfect for hitting all the stores and the staff was so helpful with our many trips back and forth to the hotel with lots of packages. The Sofitel is going to be the place we stay -- it is going to be apart of our tradition.
232,244,"Jan 19 2008 	Stunning lobby great rooms fantastic hotel!	We spent a few nights at the Sofitel last week and were very impressed by its design, comfort, location, and staff. After having visited, we can fully understand why this is the best rated hotel in Chicago. The wonderful experience starts at the lobby, which manages to pull off a rare blend of sleek design and decadent comfort. If you ask for a room on the high floors, you'll get a good view of Downtown Chicago and may even glimpse Lake Michigan. However, the views are not the high points of the rooms. The bed was quite simply the most comfortable one I remember sleeping on! So much so that we ended up spending much more time in the room than out and about. The bathrooms are great - spacious, luxurious and bright. The Sofitel is located only a few minutes walk from one end of the Magnificent Mile, and is an excellent starting point for a walk around Chicago. Oh, and if you visit in winter and don't want to brave the elements, the room service menu is actually quite decent. We will definitely be coming back to Chicago and will, without a doubt, stay at the Sofitel again."
233,244,"Jan 18 2008 	Nice Hotel Great Location	Stayed here for a couple nights inFeb. 2006 The hotel lobby is stunning. Very sophisticated. I would recommend this hotel for adults traveling without children or business travelers. Just not a family-friendly establishment. The room was of good size and the bathroom was just wonderful. They have a stereo system to where you can hear the tv in the bathroom. Nice feature when one of your party has to get up to get dressed early in the morning, while the other is still sleeping. The gym here was also very nice with new equipment. I had breakfast in their restaurant. It was average....not really worth the price. Skip it and go to McDonald's around the block. The location is excellent, just a short walk to the John Hancock building. My only complaint is that we kept hearing a noise in the bathroom wall. We finally called down to complain only b/c I had difficulty sleeping b/c of the noise. They sent up a repair man very quickly, but he could not fix the problem. Something about the pipes in the wall shrinking and expanding, so we were stuck with the noise. I wish the hotel staff would have at least offered to put us in another room. That's the only fault I could really find though."
234,244,"Jan 9 2008 	Fantastic French hotel with stunning views.	One of the greatest hotels that I have ever stayed in! I was over from the UK on business and I picked my girlfriend up from Chicago airport and decided to make use of the valet service. They were brilliant. Car was taken off me and the bags were in the room before I knew it. We had a meal in the restaurant which was very very good and not too formal. There were lovers, families and business people all in the same surroundings without anyone looking out of place. The bar was great and stayed open until 2am at the weekend which was great fun! The room was a little small but nevertheless the views from the 23rd floor were amazing! Our wardrobe door was broken which was a pain but we were having so much fun I could not be bothered to report it until we left!! Superb location. Stayed for two nights.Believe all the reviews this hotel is awesome! 10/10"
235,244,"Jan 2 2008 	Absolutely Fantastic	We loved loved loved the Sofitel and Chicago. We had a five night stay to celebrate two 30th birthdays, both our rooms were fab with gorgeous views of the John Hancock building. We had strawberries dipped in chocolate on arrival waiting in our room. The cleaning staff were unreal, we never saw them but any time we left our room we came back to a cleaned room with fresh towels, also a small bottle of evian each every night. The reception, door and bar staff were extremely friendly - as was almost everyone we met in this wonderful city. The hotel is in the best location, everything was in walking distance, great restaurants, bars and shopping. As a frequent traveller to New York, I have to say that Chicago blew it out of the water for our group and we will certainly be back... and will definately stay at the Sofitel."
236,244,"Jan 1 2008	Fantastic!!!	We stayed here for 5 days in Dec 07. Ours was a standard room on the 17th floor. Room was a good size with an amazing bathroom. The windows were floor to ceiling, which made the room feel light and open, and we had a nice view. The bed was very comfortable! Location was fantastic. Less than a 5min walk from the Hancock Tower &amp; Mag Mile.The staff were efficient, friendly, and very helpful, especially the concierge desk.We did not use the hotel restaurant, bar or room service, so can't comment on those.There is free internet access on the 2nd floor, which could sometimes get busy, but was handy if you quickly needed to check e-mails etc. We booked direct using the Sofitel website and paid roughly 100 per night, which for such a lovely hotel with a fantastic location, in my opinion was a bargain."
237,244,"Dec 21 2007 	Modern and Beautiful	We stayed here for five days in October 2007, in a standard room. The check in process was very swift and the deskperson provided us with maps and useful advice when he realized we were tourists. He even suggested places to avoid, and we appreciated his candor.Our room was a beautiful but tiny gem, with floor to ceiling windows. The bath was very large, and equally attractive, with an awesome rolling barn-style door. The bath layout is very open, so there's not much privacy, though the size of the room could have permitted a separate toilet area.There are several computers with free internet access in the business center and the free fitness room is nicely equipped. Check out the bathrooms on the second floor near the conference rooms-- wow!.Overall, we found the design, location, and service to be excellent. The room was expensive (~300/nt, I found the best deal on the Sofitel site), but I suppose that's not so bad for Chicago.Because of the tiny room sizes, I suggest that they switch to flat screen TVs. The TV took up nearly the entire table at the foot of the bed, making the room feel cluttered and cramped. This certainly didn't detract from our stay though!"
238,244,"Dec 19 2007 	Wonderful stay at the Sofitel	We stayed at the Sofitel for a brief getaway. From check in the service was prompt and exceptional. We were given early check in and because we were celebrating a special occasion given chocolate covered strawberries (a nice touch). The room was tastefully decorated. The location is great, just one block from the Hancock bldg. On departure we had late check out. The bellman were prompt and the concierge extremely helpful with restaurant advice and obtaining last minute reservations. This hotel is truly deserving of one of the finest ratings in the city."
239,244,Dec 19 2007 	Luxury respite from the cold	Really loved this hotel. November in Chicago was cold as expected which made it all the nicer to return after a day of sightseeing to a quality hotel. It felt cosy - really nice bed and bathroom and we felt at home in our 4night stay. The staff were friendly. Good central location for walking and metro stop near too. We had a great view from our room and the great design of the building meant it was easily recognisable amongst the skyscrapers on our return home at the end of the day. Had to shop around for a good price but it was worth it!
240,244,"Dec 19 2007	Wonderful Hotel	We had a weeks stay at the Sofitel in November. We found the hotel to be wonderful, the decor and overall look of the hotel is very nice. One thing I particullary liked was that every evening in the lobby they lit scented candles, which smelt gorgeous and gave it a really nice feel.The room was a good size with a very clean bathroom and great shower. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud!As for the location, it was just right for us. It's a very short walk from Michigan Avenue and just aound the corner from the subway stop. Up north from the hotel, on rush street there are some really good bars and restaurants.Overall we had a wonderful stay at the Sofitel, and could not complain, definately recommended!"
241,244,"Dec 16 2007 	Luxury hotel	Great hotel, especially for the money. Nice size room (and we booked the standard), great treatment by all staff, plenty of fast elevators, excellent food in restaurant - someone complained about the portions - note Sofitels are a French chain so you receive French portions - if you want to stuff yourself Fogo de Chao is an excellent Brazilan restaurant not far away where you can eat and eat and eat! I love this location a block or two from the Hancock building - great for shopping or just roaming this part of the city and more - we walked to Navy Pier one day and the Daley Center the next. There's a McCormick &amp; Shmick's right across the street - Bistro 110 is on the next block - the list goes on... I would stay here again in a heartbeat but to give a complete review let me note a few things that may or may not be negative: older tv's - you pay for internet in the room - you pay $40/day for parking - while the beds are fabulous, we did ask for and received softer pillows and no top sheet is provided just a wonderful comforter - no mouthwash provided - no coffeemaker in room but free morning coffee in cafe - the lounge/bar is so popular it is nearly impossible to find a seat after 7pm - no tourist info in room but just ask conciere - if you have any questions or concerns about ANYTHING, ask for a &quot;focus manager&quot; - this hotel is very service friendly - but you may have to ask."
242,244,"Nov 28 2007 	Absolutely great	We had a absolutely fantastic stay in the Sofitel Hotel in Chicago. The rooms are amazing and the city view is stunning! All the staff have been very friendly to any time from the cleaner to the receiptionist all have been very kind. The room especially the bathroom was spacious. I definitely regret that we have stayed too long in New York in the Hilton as this was totally overpriced and average. I definitley recommand the hotel. By the way the food is also great and the prices are reasonable. The location is fantastic just 1 or 2 blocks from the main shopping street. Just a great hotel with great rooms, great location, great staff and also great architecture."
243,244,"Nov 24 2007 	Excellent hotel!!	Spacious room, very, very comfortable bed, attentive service and a hotel staff who would do everything they can to help.I could not recomend this hotel highly enough!!"
244,244,Nov 23 2007	Sofitel Chicago Water Tower = Top Notch	I had a fantastic stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. The service is perfect and the rooms are clean and tasteful. The hotel is ideally situated near the Magnificent Mile and taxis are always at your disposal around the corner of the hotel to explore the city. The staff is friendly and did their utmost to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I highly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure travellers.
245,244,"Nov 22 2007 	Fantastic!	We recently stayed at the Sofitel for four nights and were thoroughly impressed. My husband &amp; I along with our 2 children (ages 11 &amp; 13) were in town for a family wedding &amp; chose the Sofitel after reading the reviews on trip advisor. The hotel surpassed our expectations in all areas: service, ambiance, convenience &amp; comfort (our king size feather mattress was incredible). We had booked a king room with city views and were upgraded to a king suite with a sofa sleeper at check in. The 2 room suite was huge &amp; had wrap around views of the city. They even provided an extra twin feather blow up bed at no charge as our kids didn't want to sleep together. Anytime we called roomservice, housekeeping, the concierge or the front desk they responded promptly, professionally &amp; in a few instances went above &amp; beyond the call of duty. My husband &amp; I have travelled quite a bit all over the world &amp; this hotel is definitely on our top 10 list. Cheers to the Sofitel!"
246,244,"Nov 7 2007 	Attention to detail and great package	I booked the romance package through Sofitel.com, a little over a grand for the weekend and the perks were well worth the price. I travel too often and the Sofitel made my wife and I very relaxed. Seems like the stars aligned as everything was perfect. Early check in, dinner at the hotel restaurant, the suite was perfect - feather stuffed bed, seperate living area, giant bath. European feel. Location in Chicago was perfect - walking distance to lake and shopping, short cab to other districts. Ill recommend this hotel to all my friends travelling to the city."
247,244,"Nov 6 2007 	spotlessly clean and well located	Great bathroom, amazing beds and all over good service.I did have a couple of issues like the gorgeously presented but woefully small dinner portions at the Cafe de Architectes and this was resolved by the manager as soon as I brought it to his attention. If you must have your coffee in the A.M. it is complimentary for guests in the cafe. I was not told this when I checked in and this was also taken care of immediately when brought to the manager's attention.,These folks really are very responsive and want your complete satisfaction....just ask if there is anything you need. The hotel is luxurious and our room was quiet with a nice view.Will stay there again.."
248,244,"Oct 29 2007 	Perfect room and location	Three night stay from October 27, Very good rates through Orbitz. Very nice, clean, and fresh room. Separate shower and tub in full size bathroom. Comfortable bed. TV needs upgrading with more channel choices. Very helpful staff with outstanding service. Great location for the Mag Mile, dining, and site seeing. Would definitely stay here again."
249,244,"Oct 29 2007 	Nice stay at Sofitel!	My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights during an anniversary trip in April. The hotel location is perfect for walking to Michigan Ave. and other shopping/eating areas. Also, there is a little market cafe (The Goddess and Grocer) just to the north on Wabash that has delicious breakfast and quick lunch items. The Sofitel is also a short walk to many public transportation routes if you don't need to get a rental car. The staff were amazing, very friendly! They put chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely card in our room to wish us a happy anniversary. They even let us check out late at 3pm to accomodate our late flight home. The rooms were clean (although small), beds were comfortable and amenities were plenty. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower but the tub is tiny and very shallow, not the most relaxing. Overall it is very nicely designed, superb staff and excellent location, we will be back!"
250,244,"Oct 22 2007 	Really enjoyed stay	The Sofitel was great - modern decor, marble bathroom with huge shower and separate tub, helpful and friendly staff, so close to Magnificent Mile shopping and lots of restaurants. I signed up for their Privilege card which helped me get early checkin and late checkout, one complimentary drink and a small gift (chocolates). Small bottle of Evian water was provided with turndown service each night. Conference facilities and food were also very good.Minor dislikes - noisy air conditioner and clunky tv in the room."
251,244,"Oct 17 2007 	Wonderful Experience	My stay at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was just wonderful. From the excellent client service to the beautiful room and facilities, I could not have stayed at a better place. The staff was beyond helpful and always kind. This is the first hotel I've stayed at in a very long time where I felt that I didn't need to disinfect everything first! Would definitely stay again."
252,244,"Oct 14 2007 	First class all the way	Sofitel is very sophisticated in a modern, European style. I booked through whatahotel.com and got an upgrade, free breakfast, even a nice appetizer, a better deal than Amex Platinum fine hotels. The hotel itself is in perfect location, near Peninsula and Park Hyatt. Architecturally, it is a fascinating structure. Check in was quick and pleasant, and I got a large suite with a great living room, huge bathroom and magnificent bedroom. The only negative is the television set. Oddly enough, they are old and clunky, really a dissapointment in such a plush and luxurious setting. The bed was super comfortable and the suite was enormous. Breakfast was delicious, and the bar on the second floor is active and fun. I don't see how you can go wrong here."
253,244,"Oct 11 2007 	Lovely Stay	If you want to have great service and be in a perfect location forall that Chicago has to offer, then this hotel is for you.Everything from check in to check out went smoothly and this could not have been a better travel experience.We made an early check-in request when the reservation was booked but were told to call the front desk 1 hour before our arrival. We called that morning and the rooms were blocked out for us in advance. We checked in and were in our rooms by 10:30am! Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was delish and reasonably priced. Location could not be matched for the $$$."
254,244,"Oct 4 2007 	Great choice in Chicago	Based on the reviews of this site, we decided to stay at the Sofitel for two nights at the end of August. We couldn't have been happier.The location is perfect, right off Rush Street and a block from the John Hancock building. It is only three short blocks from the Chicago station on the red line and less than 30 minutes to the river on foot.The rate of $235 per night for a top floor (on 31st) was a steal. We booked directly on the hotel website and got the 15 day advanced booking discount.As others mentioned, the rooms aren't huge but the mirrored closet and full length windows make it appear more open. The bathrooms are heavenly, and I made good use of the soaking tub both nights. The beds are very comfortable and I usually don't sleep well at hotels.We only ate breakfast at the cafe once, it was okay and the waiter was very conscientious of the fact we were in a hurry. Drinks at the bar were great; a little pricey but comparable to other area establishments.Lastly, the concierge desk was very helpful. The recommendation for dinner at Le Colonial was right on point.We would recommend to others and will likely stay again."
255,244,"Oct 3 2007 	Could Have Been Better	October 3rd, 2007My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007.The hotel is VERY modern. The room was immaculate, but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA. It was chipped in many places. The light switches were difficult to find, and the HVAC made noise. However, the bed was wonderful. The bathroom was large and well maintained. Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted. The restaurant was small. You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo. If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel. However, after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel.Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full. When we checked in, we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals. Upon returning home, we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it. This reduced the line of credit, and it took several days to be removed from the card.Great location! Reasonable value. If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon."
256,244,"Oct 2 2007 	What a great hotel..what a great city!	We planned a weekend in Chicago to break up our journey from the UK to San Fran. What an inspired choice! Chicago is a must visit city, such beautiful architecture, friendly people and it must be the cleanest city in the US. We chose the Sofitel for it's central location (close to the shopping) and it could not have been better. Out three nights there were a treat ~ fantastic service from everyone we encountered and we did not hear one sound when we were in the spacious and very comfortable room on the 29th floor.Oh and my wife has not stopped talking about &quot;the most comfortable bed she has ever slept in!&quot;.The room had great views of the lake and the surrounding skyscrapers. I hugely recommend this hotel and the surrounding area is great for bars and restaurants too."
257,244,"Oct 1 2007 	Sofitel Water Tower is Sensational!	Just spent the weekend in Chicago at the Sofitel Water Tower. What a fantastic place. We got a great rate for a really fabulous room. Beds are amazing, as are the linen &amp; towels. Rooms kept to very high standard. Foyer and public areas are modern and groovy. Great staff, wonderful location. Breakfast was good, would have preferred buffet style. A great place to experience Chicago."
258,244,"Sep 29 2007 	not as good as these reviews make out	We stayed here for 2 nights having previously stayed at the Sofitel in New York some time ago. The hotels do not bear comparison. Chicago is a large impersonal place lacking in any soul or atmosphere. The room was surprisingly small and was not the double double I booked from their website. On the plus side the room was spotless and had everything you would expect from the flagship Sofitel brand. It did not , however, represent value for money and I expect you can get better deals for the money elsewhere in Chicago. Also for the price I was astonished to have to pay for a WiFi connection."
259,244,"Sep 25 2007 	Good Choice and Location....	Stayed for 2 nights and upon arrival we were given Room# 3202 on top floor, but room windows have a structural problem and condensation builds up and you can't see a thing. Went down to Front Desk and within 15 minutes were given a new room #2914 which had a fantastic view towards Lake and Hancock Tower. Hotel has a sleek Euro feel, and room was nicely appointed. Turn down service provided 2 free bottles of water every night. It is centrally located near lots of shooping and restaurants near Mag Mile. Will definitely stay here again as our $270 per nite rate was excellent."
260,244,"Sep 21 2007 	Not impressed at all	I stayed here for 1 night for business. Granted I arrived very late, but the hotel failed to impress me. The hotel thought I was arriving at 10 AM (instead of 10 PM), so they cancelled my reservation when I didn't show up at 10 AM (even though the room was prepaid for 2 nights). Being a French owned hotel, it took forever for the staff to acknowledge the hotel's mistake and finally give me the room which my company had already paid for. The room was okay. On the plus side, the bed was extremely plush and comfortable, and the bathroom was extremely large - almost as big as the bedroom (which is on the small side for the price). However, my first impression when I walked into the room was that the furniture looked like it came from IKEA. It was all blonde, modern Scandinavian wood that was probably much more expensive than it looked (it looked like cheap veneer, quite frankly). The lobby was more Euro modernist decor - and the hotel keeps it dark at night for some reason. My meeting was at the W Lakefront, whose decorator is apparently a Euro wannabe..."
261,244,"Sep 20 2007 	Excellent hotel in hard to beat location	Just back after spending almost 2 weeks at this hotel, no complaints at all, spotlessly clean and great service from start to finish. Upgraded to a suite at check in, well worth the extra cost. Bathroom opulent and generally everything about the hotel is very classy. Location is super, 1 minute walk from the magnificent mile and Hancock Tower. Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby, and wonderful city views from most rooms. Glad to recommend this hotel, and would certainly stay there again. Air con in roms was great as it was in the 90s for most of my stay."
262,244,"Sep 15 2007 	Excellent choice	We really enjoyed the Sofitel, it was in an excellent location was clean and the beds were to die for so comfortable. We only had breakfast in the restaurant so cant comment on lunches or dinners but what we had for breakfast was v. good and not expensive either."
263,244,"Sep 7 2007 	Best in the City	My husband and I spent Labor Day weekend at the hotel and from the minute we pulled up to valet (word of caution, it's $40 per day) until we checked out, we were delighted by the experience. At check in, we were upgraded to an upper level room that directly faced the Hancock Building...fabulous view! The rooms are styled similar to those in the trendier European hotels (reminded me so much of hotels I've stayed in when in Holland). We couldn't beat the location, service, and style for the price. We actually thought it was a steal. I'd recommend pre-paying if possible. We saved $150 on our bill by doing so. We'll be staying at the Sofitel when we visit Chicago from now on."
264,244,"Sep 3 2007 	Best beds and hotel in Chicago!	Do not stay at this hotel if you plan to do any sightseeing as the beds are seriously comfortable - you will not want to leave!The hotel is ideally located just off Michigan Avenue (2 blocks), but far enough away that you don't have all the hustle and bustle. The location of course makes it ideal for shopping and the sightseeing if you can get out of bed, or it's of course perfect for collapsing into after a hard day!The rooms are modern and well furnished, with fantastic views of Chicago. Did I mention how great the beds were?!The restaurant (Cafe Des Architectes) was really nice with great breakfast, although I found the service a bit of a let down.I really can't rave about this hotel enough and it would be my first choice in Chicago (and other locations) in future!"
265,244,"Sep 2 2007	Remains the top hotel for the money	Returned to this hotel recently for another weekend getaway to chicago. In the 3 years that I have been staying here can say that the experience remains above-average. Whilst my style of hotel would run more towards that of the Peninsula, I prefer the feeling ofbeing at this hotel.-Rooms continue to be well-maintained; super clean, beds extremely comfortable, ample toiletries. I have generally stayed in suites here but arranged a room for my brother that he indicated was extremely comfortable.-Service always great; polite, friendly and helpful staff are the general rule here.-Sofitel bar; one of the best hotel bars you will find in chicago; great vibe, great service, outstanding meeting place. Major plus for this hotel.Because my objectives in chicago are only 2-night weekend getaways perhaps I do not seek as much from a hotel than others on this site but I cannot recall anything negative about this hotel. Highly recommend."
266,244,"Aug 25 2007	Wonderful	I've stayed at MANY MANY hotels (for business and pleasure) and I have to say that Sofitel Chicago is probably the BEST hotel experience I've ever had! We went to this hotel for a romantic getaway weekend and simply loved the entire experience.OVERALLFirst of all the hotel is VERY French (french style, french decor, french staff). My boyfriend is also French so I think it felt a bit like home to him. The staff were also curteous, genuine, and helpful. THE ROOMOur room had floor to ceiling windows with an unbelievable view of the entire city. The decor was fantastic - everything looked new and modern, the beds were AMAZING and the lighting/ ambiance in the room was perfect. THE FOODThe food at the hotel restaurant was great - not blow your mind away amazing - but for the price it was quite good. The best part is that they bake their own French bread - and it's INCREDIBLE. They even sent us home with a fashionable looking doggie bag full of fresh baked bread."
267,244,"Aug 23 2007	Great location stylish and value for money	Had a wonderful experience at the sofitel. Have had not so great experiences at other sofitels (found them very sterile). Chicago sofitel was in a perfect location for going out and shopping, rooms were sizaeable, clean and stylish. Rate for the hotel (about USD 260 / night) was far cheaper than the nearby Peninsula or four seasons. Would definitely recommend it - good business center as well"
268,244,"Aug 21 2007	A good stay but not entirely worth the $$$	Hubby and I stayed here this past weekend (Aug 17-Aug 19) The service from the staff was very, very attentive. I think, after valeting our car, we had 6 people greet us and/or open doors for us. It was stunning! Check in was ok, but I had booked this hotel 6 months ago and had called once before my stay to make sure they had my Sofitel privlege card in the system. I was assured they did. Upon check-in, I found out, they did not. We did end up getting our 'free drink' coupon but not until the very end of our stay (when we could no longer use it.) Also, no newspaper outside of our door at all. One of the big pluses I like about staying at any hotel is the free newspapers to read. I can't believe we were paying over 350 per night and didn't even get a lousy newspaper. The room was nice, but certainly nowhere close to being one of the nicest I've stayed in. Not even equipped with flat screen televisions. Hubby commented on that right away. So odd. The sitting room was all 'art deco' and was not very 'welcoming' really. Would have been perfect if we had been hosting people for drinks or something, which we were not, but the area was not very comfortable to just 'hang out in.' The TV was placed so far away from the couch that faced it, that the whole scheme of the 'sitting room' didn't make much sense. The location of the hotel is good. It's a couple of blocks from the 'top' of the Magnificent Mile of shopping, but not far from everything if you are up to a walk and are in good health. Definitely go next door to the Tempo Grill for breakfast. It's fast and very good! The highlight of the Sofitel is the excellent concierge. One of them (named Jackie) actually got us an extra last minute ticket to a sold-out Second City show (we had tickets but needed one for a friend.) All of our interactions with the concierge at this hotel were top notch. All in all, it's a nice hotel. It's well decorated and very attentive staff. However, the little things like not having a view of the lake (from most rooms,) not having a daily newspaper delivery, and not being right on the Mag. Mile, are detractors when you are paying what we were paying. I don't feel like I wasted my $$ but I do feel that I could have gotten more for less (if that makes sense.)"
269,244,Aug 19 2007	Clean beautiful and friendly	It is one of the best hotels that I've ever stayed at--and I'm very picky.Pro's: great location one block off busy Michighan Ave  terrific restaurant and outdoor cafe friendly unpretenscious staff incredibly clean and brand new sleek decor hip international clientelle I always felt safe (see theft stories below)Con's: it can be a little pricey (I paid @315.00/night) no adjoining rooms great city views but not much of a lake view 40.00/day for valet parkingOverall a wonderful experience. I almost stayed at the Drake-but I'm very glad I didn't. I checked it out while I was there and it has become very dated and run down.
270,244,"Aug 18 2007 	Sofitel architecture mixed staff	Stayed here one night in the summer for a convention. The location is not on the lake, nor on Michigan Ave, and in fact there are so many tall buildings around, that even on high floors, the lake is barely visible. Three blocks to Rush street/nightlife was ok. The interior is Sofitel chic, kind of like a W but not so dark, if you get what I mean. There are many rich people lurking in the lobby and bar, so it feels as rich as it looks.One of the staff had a French accent, but the rest did not, and in fact only one was the expected &quot;Sofitel-attentive&quot;. She made up for the others, although the laissez-faire trait came out a tad---oh to be in Paris again. The room was decent, not huge but deluxe in many ways. The doors to the bathroom were double wooden doors, the bath itself was huge and opulent. The desk could have been more functional, in more of a &quot;glad they thought of that&quot; sort of a way. The concierege was outstanding. Overall, I liked this place, The Millenium Knoickerbocker I stayed at a while back was horribly old and noisy and just below par for what she should have been.The Peninsula nearby has to be one of my all-time favorites in Chicago. That place has it all-modernity, cleanliness, service, coolness---just a great place. The Sofitel was not that but still in in the top 25%. For perspective, I stay in these type of hotels 10-15 times a year in the US. 75% business, the rest with family for pleasure."
271,244,"Aug 16 2007	Excellent	We had a junior suite on the 25th floor, it was excellent. The suite was huge, had a lovely king bed and was beautifully decorated throughout. In fact, the entire hotel was beautifully decorated and thoughtfully designed. The hotel staff were all first class, reception were prompt and very polite and the concierge was the most knowledgeable I have ever encountered.We didn't eat in the restaurant although it was always busy. There are many great places to eat within a very short distance of the hotel.The hotel is very well situated just a block or so from some great shopping on Michigan Avenue and you can also catch the trolley tour bus outside the Hancock Centre.Would certainly recommend this hotel to others looking for good quality four-star accommodation. We'll definitely stay there the next time we visit Chicago."
272,244,"Aug 15 2007 	Love the Sofitel	I agree with all the positive reviews below. The Sofitel is a wonderful hotel. Very modern, contemporary. Love the lighting in the lobby. Bathroom was VERY CLEAN. Loved the robes. I had one very minor complaint about housekeeping just barging in on two separate occasions (I was nearly naked both times). Wrote about it on the survey I received after stay and mgmt responded very promptly with an apology. I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend it."
273,244,"Aug 10 2007 	Wonderful Hotel!	This is an excellent choice when looking for a hotel in Chicago. From the moment we checked in, we noticed the attention to detail in everything from the flowers in the foyer to the service of the staff. The room was clean and modern with a bed that was so comfortable that we didn't want to get up. We slept so well! We found an excellent deal on the internet and were able to stay here for the price of less luxurious hotels. We were very happy with our choice and our stay. You will not be disappointed with this hotel."
274,244,"Aug 10 2007 	I never wanna stay anywhere else in Chicago	The outside of the hotel is pleasing to the eye and very classy. The front desk staff is so attentive and wonderful. We got to the hotel at 8:30am on a Thursday after a red eye and requested to check in early. They didn't have rooms available yet, as check out wasn't until 12pm and check in wasn't usually until 3pm, but they said they could give us a room by 1pm. They also didn't bat an eye when I advised them that my boyfriend was allergic to down feathers and said they would &quot;defeather&quot; the room. We left to go sightseeing after leaving our bags with the bellman (very patient while we organized ourselves!) but the woman at the front desk asked for a phone number to contact us once our room was ready. She gave us a call at 11am and left a message to let us know our room was ready and our keys were at the front desk.There were robes for each of us in the room which was nice. The room was simple and modern, but very pleasing to the eye. We were on the 10th floor with a view of the buildings (Hancock tower was viewable) and a small courtyard/park next to the hotel. The bed and pillows were wonderfully comfortable and the bathroom was gorgeous, complete with marble tiles, shower and counter. Full size hair dryer was supplied (not the connected to the wall mini kind!!), separate tub. And there are speakers in the bathroom so you can hear the TV in the bedroom! Magnified mirror in the bathroom (helpful for shaving to my boyfriend!) along with a live bamboo plant in the bathroom. The lounge is nice, very modern with a good vibe, but currently allows smokers which was a disappointment. STRONG martinis, but very attentive service to go along with it. Great atmosphere. Didn't eat at the Cafe des Architectes but hear it's very good. There is a small adorable boutique shop that is just adorable and has wonderful items available including soaps, lotions, jewelry, intimates and novelty books. I voiced my only displeasure (smoking in lounge) in their survey after my stay and promptly received a personalized e-mail from the hotel manager. I love this personal service, wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. This is an awesome location close to Hancock tower, the shops/mall and just everything we were looking for!!"
275,244,"Aug 7 2007 	What a great hotel!!!!	This was a great Hotel we stayed one night for our anniversary and this was a top choice, the bed was the best and service very good and it is a great location, only downfall when retrieving my car they said come on down in 10 minutes and it took 30."
276,244,"Aug 6 2007 	Not as good as expected but still a great hotel	As the reviews here will confirm, this is a really nice property in an ideal location. It has a crisp, contemporary feel that is certainly more W than Four Seasons, yet more upscale than a typical W. Lots of dark colors, dark wood, moody lighting, frosted glass, and some transparent tiles in the lobby floor that change colors. Cool architecture from the outside if you're walking toward the hotel from several blocks away at the right angle. Shopping and dining within blocks of the hotel is incredible. We had a particularly good dinner at Le Colonial and a nice Summer lunch on the sidewalk patio of the Tavern on Rush.The room wasn't too large but was designed with clean lines, a very comfortable bed, and a pretty marble bathroom with a separate tub and shower. The hidden speaker in the bathroom that pipes in the TV audio was a fantastic touch. We had nice views from the 26th floor, and although we were right next to the elevator and the hotel seemed pretty full, we never heard any noise from the hall. Housekeeping did an excellent job.I wanted to give the Soiftel a 5, but after a big service blunder, I can't justify anything more than a 4. Service was generally friendly and efficient during the stay, but we had a rough start. We checked in at 10:30am, and knowing the room wouldn't be ready, we had a bellman check our 3 bags (I also tipped him up front) and I gave the desk clerk our 3 baggage claim tags and asked her to have the bags sent up to the room when it was ready. We knew we'd return at around 6pm and didn't have much time before dinner to change and head back out. Upon return only 2 of the 3 bags made it to the room. After 3 calls and about 30 minutes of waiting for them to bring it up, we got no response. I couldn't wait any longer or we'd be late for dinner, so I went down to the lobby and found that no one had even attempted to find the bag. Nobody at the front desk (where all bell desk calls seem to be routed) had taken ownership of the issue and the bellmen didn't seem to be aware that we needed the bag --- which was sitting in the bell closet the whole time. I wouldn't have cared much if they had forgotten to send one of the bags up and then delivered it right away when I called, but that didn't happen. I was disappointed in how this was handled and no one really seemed to care. Other than the above issue, we enjoyed the Sofitel and thought the $275 summer weekend rate was pretty fair. If the top hotels in town (Peninsula, Four Seasons, Park Hyatt, Ritz-Carlton) aren't double the Sofitel's rate the next time I'm in Chicago, I'll probably try one of those instead. They were all in the $450-600 per night this trip, and I just couldn't justify the difference."
277,244,"Aug 2 2007 	Wonderful!	Stayed two nights at the Sofitel. Absolutely wonderful hotel. Great location. Short walk to Mag Mile and the heart of Rush Street. Every staff person I talked to was extremely kind and went above and beyond in every way. The room was very modern. The room itself was not overly big, but the bathroom was large with a separate tub and shower. We ate at the French restaurant in the lobby. The food was good. We had beef and fish and both were prepared and seasoned perfectly. We had a couple of wine flights that were very tasty. The lobby bar was also very lively, although they do allow smoking there, but the atmosphere overall was very nice."
278,244,"Aug 1 2007 	Outstanding Location and Staff	Booked this hotel after reading reviews on your site and was very pleased with the choice. We joined the Sofitel Privilege scheme as suggested elsewhere on this site and was allocated a high level room in the hotel with a good view. The room was clean and well furnished. The bathroom - separate shower and bath was luxurious with a good selection of toiletries. The staff could not do enough for you and were always available to assist in planning trips, giving advice on the transport system and pointing out places to eat. We did not try the hotel food as there were plenty of places to eat nearby -good spots included Bistro 110 just round the corner and the lively eateries just down Rush street. With the Einstein Brothers for breakfast and a Deli adjacent to the hotel it was always easy to get any food required. The Hotel's location to the Magnificent mile makes it a superb place to stay and its location off Rush Street gives access to the night life. Ideal for a shopping trip and sightseeing. The free trolley service from the water tower serves all the major attractions - but it is possible to walk as far as Navy Pier, Millenium Park or the loop from the Hotel.Would certainly stay here again if in Chicago. Contray to other comments on this site - security in and around the hotel was excellent and rooms contained a free digital safe and a deadlook on the inside of the door.A wonderful experience!"
279,244,"Jul 30 2007 	This is a wonderful urban hotel	We stayed at this Sofitel during a freezing, blustery, cold week-end in February. Our large and stylish room became a refuge from the Arctic conditions outside. The room was designed with an elegant, understated modernity and like all Sofitels around the world, was created with fine fabrics and linens. The bathroom was large and utterly comfortable. Service at the hotel could not be better and we absolutely loved the breakfast at the hotel restaurant. I worked out in their well equipped gym which allowed me to partake of Chicago's fine cuisine. The hotel is located in a fine neighborhood a few blocks from the bars of Rush Street and the shopping of Michigan Avenue. This is a hotel that other city accommodations should try to emulate. You cannot do better, in this price range, in Chicago."
280,244,"Jul 28 2007 	Great hotel	We really enjoyed our two night stay at the Sofitel.Our high-floor room was stylish and well furnished and had a decent view of the city. The location is great for the magnificent mile and other shopping, dining, the Hancock Centre and the Museum of Contemporary Art. It's less convenient for the business district but that wasn't really a problem for us.The bar was excellent (but would be even better if they'd stop playing insipid techno music in the background - it isn't sophisticated, it isn't French and hardly anybody in Europe listens to it so just stop, OK?).We didn't have the opportunity to eat in the hotel as there was so much choice in the surrounding area including a great McCormick &amp; Schmick's just across the street.The staff and valet attendants were well-presented, friendly and attentive, proving that you can do &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;welcoming&quot; at the same time.Aside from a bit of confusion at check-in (which might have been my fault, as the Accor website asks for first names and surnames in the reverse of the usual order) this was a near-perfect stay.It comes at a price but it's worth it!"
281,244,Jul 26 2007	High Five	The staff at this Hotel is excellent. Every employee from Reservationist to check out was efficient and professional.
282,244,"Jul 25 2007 	Fantastic Hotel	I adored everything about this hotel: the decor, the service, the room, the bed, the view, the elevators, everything. The hotel restaurant &quot;Cafe des Architectes&quot; is well worth the money (especially for breakfast). If you love comfortable modern chic with extremely friendly people, this is the hotel for you. I highly recommend staying here."
283,244,"Jul 24 2007 	Fabulous Hotel excellent location great weekend!	Just returned from a weekend in Chicago that was just fabulous! Arrived at Midway &amp; took the train to the hotel (had one super easy transfer with elevators for luggage and got off at Chicago and walked all of a block to the hotel), as a matter of fact we pretty much exclusively used public transportation all weekend except for one night to dinner.The weather all weekend was not to be beat, so of course that helped the overall experiencewe checked in with ease. Got a really sweat deal on the Sofitel website that included breakfast for two in the $275/nite cost &amp; it was well worth it!. To my surprised we were booked on the top floor, 32nd. Fabulous views, request this if you can. The room was immaculate, bathroom was over the top with all the marble and oversized shower. And most importantly the bed was comfortable, not the best I have ever slept on for this price, but the feather top made it nice. The only complaint here would be that they did not have down pillows, most hotels at this level do. But honestly that is the only thing I can find to complain about.This is a very international hotel with guests from all over the world, which makes it fun and interesting. The lobby and public spaces are modern but very comfortable. The bar was hopping every night, very much a lounge setting. I did use the wireless for my computer and they use T-mobile at $10 a day, this is not included in the room fee (they also have hard wire connections). The highlight was started each day with breakfast (for no additional charge!) everyday. Its not one of those insane buffets, you order from the menu and literally whatever you want. Order eggs, pancakes and French toast? Yup, they take it all off the check at the end. They have indoor and outdoor seating as well. Oddly enough, I got a message on the phone one afternoon that our breakfast was comped because we had to wait a bit that morning to get our order taken and were sorry for that. that is the act of a hotel that takes its business seriously. The only issue I had was that when we checked out all the tips I had left at breakfast were wiped out along with the food costs, so I had them add the money back to my bill as they apparently all pool tips. The service at the hotel was quite attentive, from the restaurant to the doormen, with one exception.We have found that one of the best ways to see almost any city is on a bicycle, and Chicago is no exception. We covered so much ground in one day it was insane, and you are not so exhausted at the end of the day you cant sit up for dinner. So the bed hotel incident was when we came back to the hotel at one point to grab something one of the valets coming out of the garage with a car almost took out my boyfriend on the bike, it was so close he had to drop the bike in front of the car and get out of the way, the guy just did not look before he pulled out like a bad out of hell. No one was hurt and I am not all that sure the valet understood what happened as his English was rather limited. That was the only issue, there are a lot of people coming &amp; going in that area, their entrance is fairly tight, so they should just be more careful in general.So, the bike tourfirst I cant say enough about the Chicago Greeter program! This is a service the city offers where you can hook up with someone that lives in Chicago that will give you a personalize tour for free! Who better to show you the town than the locals?! You can pick from a variety of tours or request your own, which is what I did. We asked for a bike tour of neighborhoods. You can certainly get these from the bike touring companies (and I have done those before) but nothing beats the personal service and touch of this program. Aside from its FREE, as in their service if free and the bike rental was free, insane! They get the bike from the same company everyone else rents but the fee is waived through the greeter program. Who knew!We took the train down to the park and walked the rest of the way. Marshall was there waiting for us and we got on our way. Interesting to note on this Chicago Greeter program  they like you to book at least 2 weeks in advance and it was needed for the custom program I requested (no big deal) but they all have greeter on demand (or something like that) on the weekends, so you can go in there and get someone if they are available. I think there are like 200 volunteers in this program, many of them retirees, and its just a really fun way to learn more about the city as opposed to some canned script.We toured around for about 2+ hours and saw much of Chicago that I had not seen before. Again, on the bike you can see all of Grant and Millennium Parks in a fraction of the time to walk it, and stop along the way when you like. Also, what is fabulous about Chicago is Mayor Daley and his serious commitment to biking as transportation. There are bike lanes on streets, racks on all buses, bike route map for the city streets and bike directional signs on the streets  it makes a big difference. You can really feel comfortable that even if you dont know the city you can make your way around without being too intimidated.From there we then rented the bikes for another 4 hours (this we had to pay for) and rode all over the place. We trekked out to Wicker Park and Bucktown, we definitely got the neighborhood feel out there. Walked through a mass of eclectic shops &amp; had a bite and headed back through Lincoln Park (lots of nice shopping)  very nice area. Then through more parks and out to the shore and then returned the bikes. It was awesome fun! So much we would have never seen on foot alone.For highlights on the weekend we went to one of the most expensive restaurants of my life, Spiaggia, but the food &amp; service was pretty darn excellent. They do courses, which I love, because you get to try so many flavors without being so full you cant breath at the end of the evening. The waiter even suggested a great wine that was under $100, no small task when bottles went as high as $800+. Was a great way to kick off the weekend on the first night. Around the corner from the hotel on Rush St is Downtown Dog, a take out hotdog place that is just the bomb, always have to hit that when I go to Chicago. One night was dinner up Rush Street at Carmines (I thin) it was really late when we ate so finding a place was not that easy, food was great, I have been there before as well. One night we headed south of the Loop to the Chicago Firehouse in search in steak. This place is nice, an old firehouse that has been restored, very cool space &amp; also has outdoor seating. The food as good, not over the top fabulous, but the change of scenery was nice, apparently Mayor Daley moved down to this emerging part of town and hangs there a lot. Our waiter Noel was excellent, has been there since they opened, the service all around was quite good. And closed it out with a game at Wrigley field! Great fans and the mini-stadium seating on top of the houses surrounding the ball park was something you have to see in person!"
284,244,"Jul 22 2007 	Modern clean and fun	If you're gonna stay in downtown Chicago, you're likely going to pay over $200/night. You might as well stay at one of the nicest hotels and pay a little more. That's the Sofitel.It's very modern looking throughout. The room was very clean and simple. Was surprised they didn't have flat panel TV to round-out that modern look. The bed was extremely comfortable - great linens, mattress and pillows. Bathroom was very nice and well sized.I really like the design in the lobby. The floor has a great rotating color light coming up through a few translucent tiles - really cool. They have great modern looking flower arrangements and a nice bar.Wireless internet is not free here. Gotta pay for T-Mobile wireless access.It's better to get a room facing north or east. You'll see in my photo that the rooms facing southwest don't have much to look at - decent, just not great."

289,244,Jul 15 2007 	Loved the decor	We spent our 10th wedding anniv. here and it was beautiful. Loved the modern decor. We had cocktails in Le Bar before our dinner reservation and Luci the Brazilian bartender was delightful. The lobby is lit with scented candles in the evening and the rooms have real orchids which I found to be a very nice touch. Everything was within walking distance. The room was extrremely clean and we had a very nice view on the 23rd floor. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend the Sofitel.
