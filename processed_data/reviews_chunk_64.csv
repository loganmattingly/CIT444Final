13,1580,"Jul 29 2008 	GREAT stay at Lord Berri	I truly liked the Lord Berri. How important is the greeting at the front desk? VERY. Veronique greeted me in a very welcoming manner and checked us quickly. She offered the parking garage, and although the price was $7 cheaper next door on the street, I am glad that I took the offer for the parking garage. The garage was clean and a very easy walk to the elevator. Our car seemed much safer in the garage than on the street.We stayed in suite 505. It was really very large: one bedroom, two bathrooms, two closets and a living room. Everything was superior in cleanliness. The furniture was a dark wood. I especially liked the &quot;entertainment center&quot; piece in the living room, and the books on the shelves. One book was the life story of Anne Sexton. Read that story in college.Room included: a safe, a refrigerator, a coffee machine, two air conditioners.Breakfast at the hotel was good. The waiter was very friendly. The restaurant features Italian food, offers a dinner special on mussels ($16.95 ?), and has two wide screens TVs.WIFI access was immediate for $10 for duration of stay. WIFI reception in the room was strong and fast.The maid left lots of supplies and clean towels.University of Quebec at Montreal is directly across the street.Metro stop is a short walk, as is Chinatown and Vieux Montreal.There are a lot of YOUNG beggers / homeless / drug addict kids on St. Catherine Street. Say &quot;desole&quot;, or sorry, and they will live you alone. This hotel appears to be very family friendly. The kids we see in the elevator appear to be happy and enthused with their stay.Nice hotel, great reception at the front desk."
14,1580,"Jul 28 2008 	All is well that ends well!	I'm not usually one to take the time and write reviews, but this time I had to make an exception. My girlfriend and I decided to plan a weekend trip to Montreal for a bit of shopping, cultural experience, and a to enjoy the night life. Booking under a week to the date, and on a busy summer weekend, as well as not having any experience in Montreal travel, I was quite worried looking for a reasonable place to stay. Browsing through many other hotels, b&amp;b's, and apartments, I was quite nervous of book a place from many mixed reviews. Price was an issue, but we didnt want to go too cheap at the expense of quality. I settled on the Lord Berri because of a majority of good reviews, appealing website and photos, as well as there own underground parking garage. I highly recommend this hotel with the following key pieces of advice.- Get there early on the day of your reservation, even if your room is not ready, so as to secure a spot in their limited underground parking. It's price is similar to independent street level parking lots, but secure and gives you a piece of mind if you're like us and unfamiliar to the safety of areas within the city. - Book online through the hotel website as they often have deals and I managed to score a really nice room with a queen size bed for only $99.Some addititonal good points of this hotel is: - It's two steps off of St. Catherine street where most of the action is. - Ten/ fifteen minutes walk to major shopping/happening spots.- Right beside a Metro stop which by subway can take you anywhere.- A little quieter than staying a few blocks away on the busiest part of town. - I had read mixed reviews about the staff and rooms, however staff was very helpful and provided us with constant directions as well as restaurant ideas. Rooms were also excellent in condition and clean!- Grocery store, drugstore, liquor store, and coffee/book shops, all extremely close for last minute convenience or necessity. Other points:If you're looking for a hotel with other major frills, this might not be the best for you. The lobby is basic and hotel restaurant/bar/cafe was alway empty and quiet. But if you're only there for a short period of time and dont require any special facilities in your hotel, this place is perfect. My recommendation is for the discounted website specials, this hotel has amazing bang for it's buck. If I was going to pay the normal rate at close to 170, I might still choose this hotel, although I'd research around a bit more to see if I could get more for that price. Being as I was looking in the 100 dollars/per range, after all my research and nightmares, this was the best possible outcome I could have hoped for."
15,1580,"Apr 23 2008 	New Years	Stayed at the hotel for new years eve with college friends, and enjoyed the stay but it was nothing special. The price was good because we traveled with a group that got a good rate, and bus transportation from Boston to Montreal included. The hotel is pretty old, slow elevator, basic bath, average rooms. A nice restuarant located in the main lobby which is great because it has a bar with decent priced drinks for a hotel bar. The serivice was good considering the hotel was full of college students there to party for new years eve. almost the entire hotel was full of students who were there to party, so dont go here on new years for a family trip, i would not recommend it. The hotels location is GREAT and is right in the heart of the city and all the best night clubs and bars. As well as very close to all the historical parts of the city of montreal. I have stayed here the past two new years and am planning on going again for NEW YEARS 2009 at the end of this year, and will stay at the lord berri again. and will enjoy my trip there again."
16,1580,"Jan 15 2008 	Decent but way overpriced for what you get.	I have stayed at the Lord Berri twice, and I can honestly say that I have no substantive complaints. The hotel is very basic, safe, relatively clean and quiet.However, for what you get, IMO, the price is a bit steep. You can find small hotels and B and Bs not too far away that are far better value. A couple of years ago, this place was a good deal but for the amount they are charging now, I would take my business elsewhere."
17,1580,"Aug 1 2007 	Lord Berri was a Great Spot!	My friend and I were just at the Lord Berri for a two night stay. It's in a very convenient location (right at the start of the Gay Village, just above ChinaTown, and right next to the Latin Quarter) , and is clean and comfortable. They upgraded us (at no extra charge) to a one-bedroom suite as our requested room type wasn't available upon arrival. It was lovely, with a huge king bed, a sofa bed in the living room, two washrooms, fridge, ironing board/iron. The sofa bed was very uncomfortable (we needed two separate beds so we needed to use the sofa bed) but other than that, it was a perfect spot. The staff was friendly and polite, and with the size of the place (only 10 stories) you don't feel lost in the crowd as you would at a bigger hotel."
18,1580,"Jul 31 2007	Good thing I'm a smoker	Being a smoker, I reserved a Smoking room, but somewhere between me, Travelocity and the Lord Berri, I got a non-Smoking room. Lucky I only had to stay there one night, because the room smelled awful! It smelled like stale sweat only muskier! Next day I was assigned a Smoking room and it had no unpleasant odors at all. In fact I thoroughly enjoyed my remaining four nights in this hotel. Room was comfortable, and quiet even though it was right above a busy street. Staff was pleasant, friendly and very helpful. Had a problem with the tv; they couldn't completely fix the problem but showed me how to manually bypass it to get the tv to work."
19,1580,"May 8 2007 	Great place to stay and a bargin for the location	I have to say that I have stayed at the hotel 3 times now during the montreal jazz festival. The hotel staff were nice and the rooms were very large. The hotel is a bit old, but for the price it was great. In addition everything was very clean and our window had a great view of the city. I will stay at this hotel again this year in July. The other hotels in the area are either not as close or to expensive. In particular during the jazz festival."
20,1580,"Apr 9 2007	Not as bad as other reviews would suggest	We stayed at the hotel while joining some friends who were on a tour from France, so we did not book the hotel ourselves but were part of the tour. When I got the name of the hotel and checked the reviews on Tripadvisor.com, they were so uniformly bad that I almost canceled the trip. All I can is that I'm glad i didn't, as we had a totally different experience. While this is by no means the Ritz , Sheraton, or Hilton, it was perfectly adequate for a night's stay. We came in late independent of our group and the reception was very helpful in finding our reservation and assigned room. The room itself was fine - firm beds and clean, although I would have appreciated an extra blanket - because it was so late I didn't bother calling the desk."
21,1580,"Feb 13 2007 	If I could sue this hotel I would 	I was employed with a group of people in a temp job for a week, and the employer put us up in this hotel. I didn't know much about the hotel, other than it was in a great location downtown, and had a restaurant attached to it. When I walked into the hotel, I felt like I was in some seedy motel that I would see in these old movies. The decor in the lobby appeared to be from a time before I was born. The desk clerk who checked me in, who was actually pretty friendly, indicated that my hotel room was paid for by my employer. She noted that there was 2 of us staying in the room (myself and another employee that I had yet to meet). She indicated that although the room was paid for, I had to leave a credit card or $500 cash to cover incidentals. The other guest would have to do the same when he/she arrived.I was really reluctant to give my credit card info, given that I was in a foreign city staying at some strange motel - who knows what would happen to my personal and credit card info? Seriously - when you walk into this place, you don't get a sense of poshness or security - one doesn't feel safe - very disconcerting actually. But she indicated the nearest bank machine was quite far away. So despite my serious reservations, eventually I gave in, and gave my credit card info, but made it absolutely clear that it was ONLY to be used to cover incidentals and nothing else. I signed the registration form, and off I went to my room.The room was OK. At least the water was hot. Again, the bedcovers and decor was from the 60s or 70s and the carpet looked like it hadn't been washed in decades. The locks on the door looked flimsy - really only a push button lock that can be jiggered with a credit card. I had to put a chair in front of the door. But I've seen worse. Restaurant food just OK - can walk one block east and one block north to the mall, and get early breakfast for a 1/3 of the price though.Check out time - I make sure I get a receipt - showing the room is paid in full, and that I didn't owe anything because no incidentals were charged. I figured, I'm pretty safe.3 months later, I get a massive charge on my credit card for almost $1000. I call the hotel to get an explanation, and they tell me that the clerk who told me that the room was paid for told me the wrong thing, and that they had the right to charge me because they had my credit card &quot;on file&quot;. They also had the right to charge only me, and not the other guest, because the room was under my name, presumably because I checked in first. Because I had signed the &quot;guest registration card&quot; (which didn't even have any credit card info on it), the credit card company refused to reverse the charge.When a hotel takes your credit card, and tells you that they agree to only hold that information for the purposes of paying for incidentals only, and then months later attempts to make some arbitrary charge on it at their own discretion, without any notice to you, knowing that you're not likely going to be there again to fight it, if you even happen to see it on your credit card bill... well, that's pretty SCUMMY. There is nothing that I can do to control what else they do with my credit card or personal information. The lodging themselves were already quite dodgy, and had I known what the lodgings were like, I would have stayed in a hostel instead. But this practice absolutely apalls me. STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!!! For your own sake."
22,1580,"Jan 4 2007 	Well...........................	Well.... I live in montreal and I had to spend one night at this hotel during renovations at my house. First, I want to answer a previous commentary... Even though the bars and others close at 3:00 a.m., it is true that every where else, you can't make noise after 11:00, even if you're at home. It's only a question of respect for other people. There are lots of groups that go there, but also young people studying at the university on the same street, that use this hotel like a residence. Also many people who are waiting for their status concerning immigration. It was not too bad for one night, but I wouldn't have stayed there longer. In our room, we called the reception because we had a question and they answered us awfully, making us feel like .... really disturbing them. The room was really hot even if we were in december ! We even had to use the air-conditioner. It was ok until around 3:00 a.m. This machine started to make an infernal noise and we had to stop it. But the room went hot again immediately, seems like the heating systems was not working well at all. Then at 7:00, the vacuum cleaner began and did not stop for an hour, so we couldn't continue to sleep. Last point but not least... the hotel's restaurant (italian.. Il Cavaliere I think) was horrible, really. It was even really expensive even though it was not good at all."
23,1580,"Jan 2 2007	Never stay there *Please read*	I went to Montreal with a large group of 16 people. We all stayed at the Lord Berri for 3 nights and all had the same horrible experiance. Firstly, they make you feel as if you are there because of punishment rather than pleasure. The first thing you see on your desk is a list of rules and regulations (some of which are absolutely absurd). Along with fines for damages. Some of the rules include: No walking outside your room in your pajamas, no glass allowed, no eating food outside of the room / bar, doors must be closed at all times, and they keep going.Secondly we had a &quot;security&quot; guard tell us that it was a national law in Quebec that quiet hours start at 11. Yes, he was serious. When do they end? Who knows because he wasn't bright enough to divulge that information. Clearly a lie because clubs on the exact same street as the hotel are open until 3 am. But at the Lord Berri that is an offense for which you can get kicked out.Dumb rules yes, but do they actually enforce them? YES. There is a &quot;security&quot; guard on every floor and their sole purpose is to enforce these rules. You will be constantly invaded by one of these guards, and they will not reason with you. 9 times out of time if you try to reason all you will recieve is: &quot;ITS OVER!&quot; and a stern look. One guard actually tackled someone down in the lobby and gave him a fat lip before he profusely apologized.Bathrooms are clean, which is nice. But if you like hot water you'll be out of luck. When showering there is zero hot water and instead it is ice cold. I had to shower out of the sink with cups because the water was THAT cold. It was this cold for all 3 days, not just one.The TVs look like they were made in 1967 but we had an OK picture. One of the rooms in our group though had one that didn't work and the hotel did nothing.There are cleaning services, but if you are caught leaving a &quot;dirty&quot; room and dont pack up all garbage / used towels you are fined an absurd amount. We kept our room clean though.Lastly, here is the most repulsive issue I have ever seen and we could probably sue them over this. Throughout the trip our toilet would not flush. It was fixed though and apparently all was well.One of our friends come home from our New Year's Eve party around 2 am. They realized they left something in the room, and when they walk in our whole room is flooded because the toilet is pumping water into our room at a constant rate. Quickly they shut the toilet off, and remove the furniture from the room. They being attempting get atleast some of the water out.During this process the &quot;security&quot; guard walks up to them and has the nerve to yell at them for having the door open and a chair outside of the room. He did not want to hear what happened, and my friend finally got through the &quot;IT'S OVER&quot; (x's 100000) and once he realized what had happened maybe you'd expect an apology, or someone to help clean up the mess that their faulty toilet caused...nope not at the Lord Berri.They were left alone to handle it, and were told that someone would come in tomorrow. When all of the parties of that room arrived home to a flooded room / damaged personal property because of the water, surely we could stay in another room.We explained what happened at the desk (in a polite manner), and asked if we could stay in a different room for the night. The man at the desk laughed and said sorry that they could not help us, and said that we needed to speak to a manager who wasn't there but would be there in the morning. So 4 people had to sleep in a toilet water infested room, with no explanation at all. So after 3 hours of sleep Will (one of the 4 in our room) wakes up early (8:30 AM) to speak with the manager. They told us again that he was not there. We checked out later that day with no explanation at all. An apology was in order, but nope it never came. Instead we were rushed out with no apology, no refund, and nothing at all. We did get out 20 dollar security deposit back which is a surprise because when the room flooded my friends were told that we'd be paying thousands of dollars worth of damages. We were a room that obeyed every rule, cleaned up after ourselves, and was always polite even after the room flooded. We have the aftermath of the room on video if this seems like too much to be true.DO NOT STAY AT THE LORD BERRI. If it is your only option delay your trip until another hotel is available."
24,1580,"Dec 14 2006 	Nice place great location	Stayed here once with friends for a weekend....nice place..good value, although there is better value in the area as well.Location: 10 min walk to Old mtl...5 mins to Village or Latin quarter...near metro...20 min walk to the Plateau or downtown.Staff: Didint really talk to any...Cleanliness: Clean rooms &amp; bathroom...Paid parking was in the basement...the rooms had fridges &amp; coffee maker.... Its clean, nice, and has decent value, although I can find cheaper rooms in Mtl that are just as nice."
25,1580,"Nov 13 2006 	poor service and promises not met	i wish i read the reviews before booking this.i went to the montreal grandprix race end of august 2006. this was a great loction as it was steps away from the metro underground station what would only take us 10 min to get to the event venue on the island.i booked for a room with 2 double beds, and made the note on the booking.i called hours in advance to confirm my booking and asked to have them read me what was booked. they said 1 double bed. i told them to read my comments. and they said oh sorry, just come and we'll sort it out. i came and was given 1 double bed. i insisted i had already made 2 arrangements while booking and also while calling to confirm but at this point they had nothing available. i dont know why and how they would try and slide this fast one on me.. eventually i was told they OVERBOOKED.. this is not new news to me as far as hotels but im not a fan of it considering i had made arrangements while on the phone while booking and confirming to get something. if i knew they could not or would not be able to keep their end of the agreement then i would not have booked with them. they didnt offer a discount but rather offerered to move me to a double room for my second nite stay and give me 2 vouchers for conennential breakfast their onsite restaurant. i requested to speak to the manager but was told he was out for the week, i contacted them a week a later and they didnt contact me back. perhaps they didnt get my message but either way i was not pleased with the service. im a nice guy and dont give the front desk staff too much of a hard time knowing they're just doing their jobs but i dont apprecite poor service, they just keep saying &quot;what do u want me to do sir, there are no rooms?&quot; on serveral ocassions i said, make me an offer to try and correct this hotels mixup, after having failed me on 3 ocassions to meet my requirements prior to booking.there is only one elevator that goes up, the other tends to be locked for use to access the basement parking, since there is no stair access to the basement.parking is limited indoors to about 15 spots underground, you'll have to park on the parking lot next door which is outdoors and run by another company, where you will have to leave your key with the front desk overnite so they can pack tonnes of cars in their tiny parking lot. give them about 45min headstart prior to leaving so they can move all the cars to get to yours.the tv's in the room were smaller then average. i was in two rooms and they both had a small tv that seemd to be of the older style and about 20inch max. when i was upgraded to the 2 double bed room we also had a small tv, this was a suprize, as i would expcect something average. i wasnt impressed.the location is good as there are restaurants and the metro access is nearby. st. catherines street is along the hotel so u can go for walks and explore the city. i would not and will not go back to this hotel. they failed."
26,1580,"Nov 4 2006 	Looks ok but very bland inside	This hotel charges the amount they do simply because they know they are in a great location of Montreal.You see the east part of downtown montreal (east of the city centre's core) has little competition with large scale hotels.Well, that may wake them up soon with Hilton taking over a property soon and opening up a DOUBLETREE CLUB hotel five minutes from their destination.The hotel is old, needs to be renovated.The rooms are basic, a bed, a small bathroom, a tv with cable but no HBO or extras. Your lucky if you can get 2 beds.I have stayed in their suites as well : Consisting of a room with a pull out sofa and a tiny bathroom (no shower) the king size bed is in a seperate bedroom and has a slightly larger bathroom with a shower. Tv, iron noard, table, and one chair. That's it.... and that's a &quot;suite&quot;My advice, en francais, T'ut Suit :) think twice befire booking there.We also had another issue which shocked us and will keep to ourselves, but let's just say trust is what is keeping us from there ever again."
27,1580,"Oct 3 2006	Awful. Staff should all be fired	Were supposed to stay here 1 night , but we had to find somewhere else to stay. Hotel is in a horrible part of town, bums sleeping in the parking lot. Hotel smelled, staff incredibly rude. I would rather sleep on the corner of St. Catherine's street in a sleeping bag then stay here."
28,1580,"Aug 15 2006 	Great location ok hotel	We stayed here for 3 nights during Gay Pride weekend - the location is perfect for festivals, etc. as there's a large park used for such events just 1/2 block away on Ste. Catherine. For gay visitors, the location is excellent as the gay village is just a few short blocks further down Ste. Catherine. Needless to say, this weekend the hotel was just crawling with sisters!There are very few big hotels in this area, which is a shame - St. Denis is a block away, with its 3-4 blocks of small restaurants and cafes piled on top of each other; a Metro stop is just a couple of blocks away; you can walk anywhere downtown easily from here.The rest is all very 2-star: the rooms are dull but serviceable, and even though we asked for a quiet non-smoking room, it reeked of years of stale smoke and the double windows couldn't block out the street noise (Berri is a busy street, except during festival weekends when it's closed to traffic). Luckily the A/C was working great, as it was very hot and humid. There's a convenient internet kiosk ($1 for 15mins) in the lobby which worked well.Parking was sold out when we arrived, so we parked in a large private outdoor lot right next door ($15/day); the next morning we got an indoor spot (again $15/day, but tiny - only 16 spaces)."
29,1580,"Jan 1 2006	New Years Eve Rocked	I spent New Years Eve in Montreal with 12 of my buddies. We stayed at the Lord Berri and it was great. The location was great, the staff was awesome and the rooms were clean and larger than we expected. I thank the staff at the Lord Berri for accommodating us, we would stay there again next year. Happy New Year 2006!!!!!!"
30,1580,"Aug 19 2005	Berri Good Deal For A Short Trip	I stayed at the Lord Berri on a trip from my camp. I do not know how much money was spent per room, but it must have been a very low amount...LOBBY: The lobby of the hotel is very nice for lounging. There is a computer in the corner where you can get 15 minutes of internet access for $1CA, a very good deal compared to what I've seen in most hotels.ROOMS: The rooms were very large and the Air Conditioners were very responsive. You could set your temperature to anything and the air conditioner would work instantly. The TV got some good channels, mostly in french, which was not good for the all-english speaking camp tourgroup. It was interesting however to watch American shows with the French dubbed. You could imagine what they were saying, which was fun. Fridge/Freezer in each room was a nice touch, and unexpected to us.BATHROOM: Nice amenity kit for a budget hotel, including sewing kit, and Pantene Pro-V shampoos, one of the nicest I've seen in any hotel I've stayed at. The showers had good pressure and temperature, however there was a plastic wall that cut into the shower that I did not think was necessary. This was not providing the maximum showering space, which I did not like.BEDS: Very comfortable. I had a very nice sleep in the bed for the two nights I stayed there.DOWNSIDE...only one telephone, located no where near bed, making wake up calls a hassle to answer.LOCATION: A good location to all of the activities we were doing. Parking is adjacent to the hotel which provided a conveinent spot for the cars. Within walking distance from Old Montreal, which is a place to definitely check out. OVERALL: I only saw people in groups at the hotel, and I think the hotel does a good job at catering to groups. If you do not like a lot of children around the floors, Hotel Lord Berri is DEFINITELY the wrong hotel. If you don't mind children, and not having a pool or fitness center, Hotel Lord Berri is a great hotel."
31,1580,Jul 5 2005	Great hotel great price!	Stayed in Montreal for 3 days. I was VERY impressed with this hotel. Clean and location was perfect. I would stay here again without hesitation!
32,1580,"May 24 2005	Rip off	I should have listened to the above reviews saying not to stay here. The staff is indeed very rude and does not care at all if you are not happy. Every time we called the front desk to ask for directions or help on where to go for food or entertainment, they didn't have a clue about anything and was like pulling teeth to get them to help. When we asked if they had a vending machine the guy at the front desk told us that no they don't have one and what do we expect for a 3 star hotel! That's actually what he said! We witnessed the girl at the front desk tell someone that there is a $50.00 fee if you check out late and she actually hung up on the person she was telling this to. So if you stay there don't check out late! Also, we arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. Check in time is 3:00. Our room was not ready yet and we were told it would be another 30 minutes! Room should have been ready at 3:00!! The room itself was OK, A bit outdated. Not the nicest, and definitely NOT worth the $149.00 we were quoted on the phone when we called. We ended up with a last minute deal for $93.00 but I'd say this room was worth maybe $79.00. The girl at the desk told us we had an adjoining room and we ended up with two rooms down completely different hallways. When we asked about this she told us that she didn't know what adjoining meant. We had a couple of problems with maids telling us they had written down on their sheet that we were checking out that day when we weren't so we had to go clear that up with the front desk. And they never did bother to come and give us clean towels or make our beds on our second day. We had to find a maid in the hallway and ask her to come and do that at 5:00 in the evening. The day we arrived our bath tub had hairs all over it. So they clearly don't clean that in between customers. And the &quot;indoor&quot; parking has about 10 spots (for $16.00 a day). Good luck getting in and out of that parking garage. We were charged $1.15 for each LOCAL call we made. Usually that is free. We had two rooms and the phone in the other room wasn't working properly. On a positive note, the guy who ran the bar in the restaurant was friendly and far more helpful with directions than the front desk and the young guy who worked in the smoke shop was friendly also and helped us with directions. They should be at the front desk."
33,1580,Apr 10 2005 	Excellent	I stayed for a night at this hotel and since I came late I requested an extension of the time of the checkout and my request was very nicely accepted. My room was very clean and the staff were very professional and very nice even guiding me through maps over the major outlets in the city and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is in a business trip in downtown or for leisure.
34,1580,"Mar 11 2005	Obviously they do not care about their customers	We booked 2 nights in Montreal at the Hotel Lord Berri about a month in advance of our trip. We booked through hotels and on the web site concerning the Hotel Lord Berri it stated &quot;indoor parking (free)&quot;. Well when we got there, the desk clerk told us there was no indoor parking and we had to park outside and pay $13 a day. Upon leaving the hotel we discovered there was indoor parking and asked to speak to the manager about it, since our two night stay turned into a three night stay due to damage while we were parked in the parking lot outside. He was not in and two desk clerks were very helpful with our concerns and issues. However, the first employee we talked to was beyond the point rude. She was not helpful at all and infact insulted us instead. We were told the manager would call us in a day and discuss our concerns with the parking and his employees. He did not call and when we finally called in a couple days later, while we were still on vacation, he made it clear he purposely did not call us and would not help us. After a long chat he said he would call us back in a week after talking to his employees. Well he didn't and when we did again he began yelling and simply hung up on us. The hotel obviously is not concerned with the satisfaction of their customers and I would never reconmmend that hotel to even my worst enemy."
35,1580,Oct 29 2004	Good hotel great location	The hotel was clean. Staff friendly. Restaurant served a good breakfast. One block from Berri subway station. 2 blocks from Quarter Latin. Quiet area. I couldn't ask for a better hotel for $80.00/night. My friends and I are going back next year and we will again stay here.
36,1580,Sep 24 2004	A Comfortable Place to Stay	A decent place to stay for a weekend getaway. Facility is clean and close enough to St. Catherine's Street. The rooms are comfortable. The price is fair. I stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and I am actually booking another trip to Montreal next month and this is where I plan on staying.
37,1580,"Oct 3 2002	Rip off	For the price $120 a night its complete rip off. Its is not 3 star hotel AT ALL. I booked 3 weeks in advance asking for non-smoking and guess what...got smoking room. Its an old hotel therefore the floors are smelly. Rooms have tiny windows looking across the other hotel. At the front desk young guys are on minimum wages so dont expect any professionalism. I asked for iron in the morning, wow! they did not know it was broken, it was 100 year old iron. The people in the hotel are all groups. This hotel sells rooms at discounted prices for probably $30 to a groups so buses all over. If you don't want to spoil you trip in Montreal, don't stay there. We only could stay one night and moved out to Fabourge hotel closer to downtown. Its a 2 star but what a difference!!!! for SAME PRICE!!! New hotel, just a year build. Breakfast included, valet parking, professional staff, beautifull!!! Recommended very much."
38,1580,"Apr 1 2002	Good and resonable place to stay.	Lord Berri, is always really reasonable and good accommodations. I have been to the more expensive hotels in Montreal and I found that my experience at Lord Berri has been the best."

1,1582,"Nov 5 2009 	..perfect location	just in the heart of downtown, this small hotel is an excllent option if you don't want to spend much but still want to stay in a convenient location in downtown..the staff were friendly...an old house turned into a hotel...rooms are of good size..didn't like the breakfast service (included with room) though..my overall experience is very pleasent and would like to go back and stay in the same hotel!!"
2,1582,"Jul 10 2009 	Good and clean but felt squeezed in.	We went to this hotel because it was recommended by Fodors. The location is great. The place offers paid parking if you reserve it in advance. The breakfast in the morning is sufficient to fuel you in the morning. The staff is very friendly - if you are arriving early or departing later, they can store your luggage before you check in/ after you check out. Check out the stairs near the reception, looks like a mirror!However, the room was extremely small. We had shower cubicle and a sink inside the room and the toilet outside (the manager did tell us this when making the reservation). Our blanket had tiny holes in it. Also, no elevators here - you will have to carry your luggage to your room - so travel light! For what you get, the room felt pricey for $100 + taxes (which is quite high in Montreal)."
3,1582,"Oct 24 2007 	Fantastic location charming hotel	After reviewing the web site of this hotel, I was already charmed. Service on arrival was very courteous and helpful in planning our stay in Montreal. The room was large, very clean, comfortable and very quiet. We had a very pleasant trip in Montreal largely due to the recommandations of the manager (Lucie) and to the easy access of most point of interest in Montreal, including the old city and underground shopping area.I highly recommand this hotel for its charming victorian style, a good price and an excellent service."
4,1582,"Jun 7 2007	Try to Avoid If You Can	The hotel is in a great location to be downtown and close to the Metro. The standard room is VERY small and needs some work. The rugs are old and stained and the room also smelled like urine. You must beware that even though the hotel site states they have wireless internet, what we didnt know until we got here is that its extra money to get a username and password to access their server. Luckily we are only here one night because we can barely open our suitcases and you definetely cant walk around the bed with them open."
5,1582,"Jan 21 2006	Charm and location	We picked this location for our stay in Montreal because of its downtown location and novelty of staying in a small inn off the beaten path. We weren't disappointed. The staff was helpful and accomodating throughout our stay. Our flight arrived in Montreal at around 1am and after checking with the management in advance we were able to check in at this late hour. Even though the staffer &quot;on duty&quot; that night had to get out of bed to check us in, we still felt welcomed.Our room was on the top floor and had a private bathroom. The room was clean, well-maintained and more spacious than I expected. No, it's not as big as a room at the Hilton or Sheraton would be, but we didn't feel cramped. The complimentary breakfast was definitely not the highlight of our stay. There were a few choices of dry breads and muffins, as well as coffee, tea, juice and milk. The breakfast room felt like we were eating in a staff lunch room. This was a charming hotel for our stay in Montreal. It's definitely a different experience than staying at one of the large chain hotels, but I truly enjoyed it. As already mentioned, the hotel has a great location - just off the McGill Campus, right downtown, a block from a Metro station. I would have a hard time visiting Montreal and NOT staying at the Manoir Ambrose....I'm very pleased."
6,1582,"Aug 1 2005	Very comfortable at Manoir Ambrose	Our stay at Manoir Ambrose was very comfortable and quiet. Although the weather was very warm outside, the AC and the portable fan kept us very comfortable. The room was clean and roomy enough. Definitely above average for the price paid. The manager and evening staff were very pleasant to deal with."
7,1582,"Dec 16 2004	Glad I cancelled my reservation there!!	I am glad I cancelled my reservation at the Manoir Ambrose Inn! I am a diabetic,and due to worsening diabetic-related health issues,I was under medical advice to cancel my entire Montreal trip this week. I regret only cancelling the trip. I have stayed in Holiday Inn,:Midtown,Sheraton Midtown, also Hotel de la Montagne. All of these hotels,esp Hotel de la Montagne,and the Sheraton,are far better than the Monoir Ambrose Inn. After I sent an e-mail letter 48 hours to the Innkeeper,advising them of my reasons for cancelling,I received a rather uncivil and rude and nasty reply. They wanted to charge me for the room. Based upon the comments here,this Inn is no bargain. In the words of the Film Industry (which I work for) the Manoir Ambrose Inn is a &quot;Stiff&quot;!! In future,the Manoir Ambrose Inn will not receive any business from me. I DO NOT recommend this Inn AT ALL. There are better Inns in Ottawa,London,Kingston."
8,1582,"Nov 2 2004	our favorite	having tried several places in montreal i will always return to manoir ambrose it's location, price and decor are unparalleled. never dissastisfied."
9,1582,"Sep 28 2004	Ambiance and Value	I was utterly impressed with my stay at the Ambrose Manoir this weekend in Montreal.The price was 112(CAD) after all taxes (2 people). I was a little concerned because of the way they told me my suite was in the basement and the bathroom was seperate (private w/key- but outside the room). However, when I got their I thought that it was awesome - it was like a cozy basement apartment. The room looked just as good as any hotel room and the bathroom was really clean an original. The location is also perfect. Right near St. Catherines and about a ten minute walk to the train station. As well, the outside of the building had this awesome vintage old Montreal feel to it.I was completely satisfied."
10,1582,"Apr 27 2004	Good Location	The Manoir Ambrose is reasonably priced, quiet and in a convenient location, near the McGill campus and the nightlife on Rue Crescent. Our room was small but decently furnished, though the water pressure on the third floor made the tiny shower a bit trying. Also, the climb up the narrow, steep stairs might be difficult for some folks.Nobody should expect first-class amenities in a small hotel at that price, but one might hope for a little more charm. The staff was inattentive and rather cold and the continental breakfast was paltry and bland.Overall, it's not a bad deal if the location suits you. Otherwise, you can probably do better elsewhere."
11,1582,"Nov 17 2003	None of the complaints as above.	The Ambrose was recommended in Frommer's Budget Traveler magazine and lived up to the review...it was clean, the staff was friendly and the location was good. What more do you want for $65 (US) a night. We encountered none of the problems that others dealt with...fortunately, I guess!"
12,1582,"Feb 19 2003	Worst hotel ever!	This was absolutely the worst hotel experience I have ever had. When a friend of ours tried to call our room, the concierge would not transfer her call, and proceeded to call our room to tell us (angrily) that we had woken her up. In addition, she actually came to our room, said that we were told that we could not have a phone call after 10:30pm (which we were never told), and insulted us, saying we &quot;needed to learn how to hear&quot;. Because of her rudeness, we left the hotel in the morning and stayed somewhere else the following night. She even had the audacity to make us pay for 2 nights... we were just glad to get out of there! I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone!!"
13,1582,"Nov 16 2002	Value and location	The Manoir Ambrose is in a very good location, close to stores and the subway. It's in a quiet area and for the price, we found it to be very good. Any other place in this area would cost double. If you have unlimited expenses, sure, pay for a 5 star hotel, but for travellers on a budget, this place is fine."
14,1582,"Jul 22 2002	you get what you pay for......	...well, the Ambrose is not the Ritz, but it is located only a block or so away. The location is great and so is the price. No, you are not going to feel pampered here, but with the money you save you can get out and enjoy the city. If you are looking to save some cash this is a comfortable place to crash. The basement rooms are a bit dank, but a great way to beat the heat in the summer. If you have a room on a higher floor, make sure it has AC."
15,1582,"May 15 2002	Manoir Ambrose better look elsewhere	While the location near McGill is nice, as well as the exterior, the hotel is the pits! Our matress was lumpy and stained beyone belief. The rug was also stained. Breakfast had a new twist: you are advised to wash your own dishes. While I wouldnt mind this in a dorm or even a B&amp;B, in a so-called hotel its a joke.When we decided to leave asap the next morning to find other accomodations, the manager wanted to charge us for another night! An outrage.You can do much better for less in Montreal by staying in a B&amp;B, of which there are tons. &quot;Pierre and Dominique&quot; is a nice one in a great area.NOT recommended!"

1,1587,"Nov 3 2009 	Trendy nice hotel in great area of Montreal	This hotel was trendy but had very good service. The rooms were nice, very confortable beds and bathrooms. Within walking distance to restaurants and bars. The hotel restaurant was very good."
2,1587,"Oct 11 2009 	Pretentious	The hotel room has very modern furnishings that it is bordering on being uncomfortable. The lighting in the room is insufficient unless you prefer your rooms to be in the barely-lit category. There is one &quot;desk chair&quot; that is as comfortable as a molded plastic chair and the &quot;comfy chair&quot; doesn't have much padding on it either. We had coffee on the 2 days that we were there and they replenished the coffee without replenishing the sugar. I don't know if it was missed but since the containers were side by side you would think that they would replenish that when they did the coffee. Thank goodness I take my coffee black because they don't provide creamer either. The hotel is bordered on one side by a street that is inhabited by drunks and substance abusers. Be careful when walking on Rue St-Laurent because people will accost you for change and there are men who urinate on the sides of the buildings so be careful of those wet puddles, they might not be water. I will recommend this hotel only if you like rooms that have gray concrete ceilings, dark brown furniture, dark blue walls, dark gray carpet, brown window shades and low lighting. I'm glad the bedding was white or I would have never found the bed."
3,1587,"Oct 10 2009 	Top-Notch Service	What stands out most about the Opus is the professional and courteous service--from the doormen to the cleaning staff, to the front desk. The room was cleaned twice daily, and the front desk personnel made dinner reservations and handled taxi cabs. The rooms were certainly nice, but not exceptional. The adjoining bar was convenient and classy."
4,1587,"Oct 6 2009 	Chic Hot Spot with exceptional service at a down to earth price	Perfect location withing walking distance of Saint Catherine for shopping, Notre Dame for Old Montreal, Cresent for Dining, Saint Laurent for night life, This hotel Has it all! Great restaraunt, club inside, and service to boot. Everyone was friendly and cutious. It wa also a Aniversary for my wife and I and the upon entering our room, the turn down service had left a bottle of Champaign. We Will be staying there again!"
5,1587,"Oct 4 2009 	think twice!	I have never written a negative review for a hotel, this is my first. Hotel room is too dark, I guess they were trying to go with their modern style of decor. Although I like how the bathroom is set up, however it doesnt have enough space/hooks/bars to hang or put your things on, again this could be due to their decor style. After a long day of travel or sightseeing, you want to be in a room that is comfortable and cozy. Opus Montreal is not.Also, location is not recommended if you are just a tourist.One good point: free wifi access at the lobby"
6,1587,Sep 30 2009 	Amazing service stylish cool chic comfortable friendly great location	My stay at the Opus was fantastic. I had high expectations for service style and comfort and I am happy to say that all expectations were surpassed. The location is in walking distance of all that is a must see in Montreal. You don't have to walk to far though for an amazing dining out experience as the hotels restaurant and cocktail lounge &quot;KOKO'S&quot; offers an exciting culinary experience and serves up some real tasty and unique beverages. Certainly the place to see and be seen..very cool!
7,1587,"Sep 27 2009 	Comfortable beds - too bad I couldn't sleep	I wish I had read some of these reviews before deciding to stay at the Opus Hotel in Montreal. The hotel itself was very nice, comfortable, and the valet staff was great. However, the nightclub kept us awake until 3am with the thumping, and the front desk gave me directions that had me driving down a one way street the wrong way. Needless to say, I would NEVER stay at this hotel again, which is too bad because it has such great potential."
8,1587,"Sep 26 2009 	Good hotel if you don't intend on sleeping	Trendy spot has great beds and good service. Unfortunately it also doubles as a nightclub which blared music right below our room from midnight until 3am, two nights in a row. Two other guests we talked to complained of the same thing. The management at this hotel need to decide if they want to be a nightclub or a hotel."
9,1587,"Sep 23 2009 	The valet damaged the transmission in my car.	Nothing too remarkable about the hotel itself. It's on St-Laurent so if that's near where you plan to go out the location is nice. Room rates are far above average for Montreal so it is no bargain, especially if you consider the hidden risks. On check-in they gave me the wrong type of room. The front desk fixed the problem by bringing up keys to the correct type of room but mumbled something about it somehow being my fault. I don't understand the purpose of their comment. What difference does it make? It was no problem at all until they made a fuss.Room was fine but construction noise started early in the morning (08:30) in the courtyard. After checking out the valet brought my car around and we drove off. I realized pretty quickly that the valet had done serious damage to my transmission. I had no reverse gear. This was a problem that could have been easily solved if the hotel covered the modest cost of the repair but instead they quite obviously (and quite embarrassingly! Poor front line staff!) avoided my calls for 2 weeks until I gave up. I guess they must be running out of money."
10,1587,Sep 19 2009 	2nd visit and Opus does it again! Amazing!	We just had to return to this hotel during our recent tour on the East side of N. America. Everything is well thought out. It's a great place for young and &quot;in&quot; travelers or anyone that appreciates a contemporary hotel.Great restaurant called Koko with beautiful decor. Great staff all well dressed and groomed.Top 3 most comfortable beds I have ever slept in!Just keep in mind that this is a place that is known for it's nightlife... there will be noise. Embrace it!!!
11,1587,Sep 18 2009 	Excellent service and experience!	We had such a positive experience with all the staff at the Opus. We were a comedy of errors as we had messed up our reservation on line and then our car broke down. Every one was extremely helpful as we were &quot;Chaos&quot;. We loved the Koko's restaurant on Saturday night - incredible food and attention to detail. My husband and I brought our bikes and loved all the extensive bike routes through the city. Coming from a different time zone - we were able to sleep in and not hear any noise from other rooms or in the halls.The bed is comfortable and the room is stylish and functional - very European. The area hosts excellent restaurants -all in walking distance. We totally enjoyed it.
12,1587,"Aug 31 2009 	Passe chic average value and at boundary of stylish neighbourhood	An average chic hotel, designed by the same mindless people as those who built similar style hotels in Taipei, Paris, Hong Kong, Bangkok, etc. Lack of lighting, dark walls and floors, noisy ventilation, leaking glass shower stalls, funky accessories from Pier 1... except this one is very spacious and bright."
13,1587,"Aug 17 2009 	Great Spot But With Some Notes	Just returned from a weekend stay at the Opus Montreal and overall it was a very good experience. It is a boutique style hotel and is very hip and can be loud but if you go expecting that than you will be happy with the stay. The place is very well situated in a great area for shops and food (go up St. Laurent to find all kinds of great spots).The only issue I have is that compared to the Vancouver Opus, I found Montreal to be less accomodating. In Van, the staff went out of their way to serve our every need and it seemed that &quot;no&quot; was not in their vocabulary. In Montreal I found the staff were not at all like that. Early check in...no. Late check out....no....In Vancouver I asked in the lounge/lobby if there was a place where I could get coffee and tea and I was told to sit down and they would bring it. In Montreal, a waive toward the corner 'theres a coffee machine over there'Just the subtle differences in the quality of service but regardless, Opus Montreal was still a great place to stay."
14,1587,"Aug 10 2009 	Vapid like Paris Hilton (not the hotel - the personality)	If Style is important to you and substance is not - than this is your hotel. We stayed at this hotel during the Montreal Jazz Festival. The location is great - and the hotel looks great. What is missing is the ability to sleep. There is a THUMPING NIGHT CLUB right below you. We asked for a room far enough away so that we would not hear the club - they put us on the 4th floor. It did not work. The ear plugs they provide do not help - the bed, floor and room vibrate. People were talking loudly from 3-5am - and even were screaming at some points during the night. I told the front desk in the morning that it was one of the worst nights sleep that I ever had - and the response was (oh Yeah the night club is pretty loud on weekends)... not even a &quot;we are sorry&quot;. I said that I was going to write a scathing review on TripAdvisor and other webpages - and I just got awful stares - with no words at all. What a disappointment and complete waste of money. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!"
15,1587,"Aug 10 2009 	Awsome hotel.	I travel to montreal about once a mth for the last 20 years, staying in hotels for the last 8. I would have to say of all the hotels in the city I have stayed at, the OPUS ranks up there. The valets were EXCELLENT, the atmosphere was trendy, and the front desk very helpful. Located in the heart of St Laurent St, the was a quick walk and ride to many places. The room rates were respectable, and to top it off, when you turn on the TV it has your name on the screen! Rooms were clean, quite and very nice, whom ever said there was a noise issue, or room service was always knocking when you didnt ask them were wrong, I had my DO NOT DISTURB sign, and wasnt disturbed till about 3pm, and i politly asked front desk that i am out of the room, may i get service,and boom by 4pm when i was back, room was clean, and they even found my partners earings from the night before. HIGHLY recomend this hotel, small, trendy, good looking patrons, and being 28, just the right atmosphere for me!"
16,1587,"Aug 9 2009 	Wouldn't stay anywhere else!	Great staff, ideal location, and perfect vibe. Having lived in Montreal, it is amazing to stay in a hotel, be able to walk out the front door and be minutes (walk, metro or taxi) from &quot;all that's happening&quot; in the city. The staff recommended great places, Koko was a blast and the rooms (we stayed twice..) were very comfortable, one with a courtyard view, the other with a stunning city view.Special requests (more ice, glasses, towels, re-booting the TV/internet which I broke, extra umbrella and a hotel car ride to the train station, etc) were accomodated exceedingly well. Even the fitness room was a pleasant surprise (we typically find hotel gyms useless - this one worked for us)We'll be back - and would not stay elsewhere in Montreal!"
17,1587,"Aug 4 2009	Great place to stay at.	The room was beautiful, hotel was very cozy and comfortable and the service was excellent."
18,1587,"Jul 29 2009 	Opus hits it right on all your business and leisure needs	I have stayed at Opus several times for both business and pleasure. From the moment you drive up to the door, you can tell that this is a first class establishment.From the valet to the front desk, you get the feeling right away that the staff has had a higher level of training that most.The rooms are sophisticated with a modern feel without going overboard.Koko Restaurant is amazing. the food is exquisite and portions are generous. I highly recommend staying around until the party gets started usually around 11:00 ish. The place turns in to a club / lounge with Montreal's best looking people. And the terrace has to be Montreal's best. If you know anything about Montreal, you know that Montrealers live for terraces.I recommend Opus without hesitation."
19,1587,"Jul 28 2009 	Opus is my favorite hotel in Montreal.	The Opus Hotel is the perfect place to say if you are traveling to Montreal. It has wonderful rooms, a great restaurant, friendly staff and is very lively for those of you who are looking for something to do after dinner. Not to mention it's great location in relation to all of the best shops, restaurants and culture in the city."
20,1587,"Jul 24 2009 	Great service and location!	Pros:We stayed for an entire week in July in a Privilege King room. From reading other reviews, we requested a room on the 5th floor and had absolutely NO problem with noise/vibrations from the bar.The service for our room was great. Our bed was made daily, the radio was turned on to a classical station to welcome us whenever we arrived at night, all bathroom products were promptly replaced even before they were half-done and the &quot;refill boy&quot; came by a number of times to ask if our coffee machine needed refills. Even if we left with the Do Not Disturb sign on, the cleaning lady always made sure to ask us if we needed extra towels, etc. when we ran into her. The front desk was also very helpful, and it seemed that there was always someone opening the front door regardless of the time of night (or morning) we came in.By far the greatest PRO would be the great location: On St. Laurent with the trendiest restaurants and boutiques; a walk away from St. Catherine and Crescent Street for shopping and more restaurants; a metro station a couple of blocks down. Overall, everything I wanted to see/do was close to Opus and we rarely took a taxi or public transportation.Cons: The only complaint I have about the room was that it was TOO DARK during the night, with no ceiling lights since their ceilings are made of concrete. Even with two lamps, two bedside table lamps, and a mirror light on, the room was very dark, making it hard to get ready, put on makeup, etc. In retrospect, I am almost certain if I asked for another tall lamp they would have provided it.Also, don't order the breakfast from the hotel. It is extremely overpriced! A simple breakfast with juice will cost one person $22. However, if you walk north of Sherbrooke on St. Laurent you will find a restaurant called Cafeteria that will serve more than what Opus offers for less than $9. To me, Koko was also overpriced; you are paying for the ambience and not the amount of food on your plate. The service was not exceptional here either; expo brought out our food assuming our appetizer plates had been cleared (since they sat empty for 20 minutes) and we also waited a long time for our refills. Go there for drinks - not for dinner.Despite these cons, I would 100% stay at Opus again. The service was exceptional and the location was great! If you are interested in coming when the Jazz Festival or Just for Laughs is on , this is a prime location."
21,1587,"Jul 23 2009 	SPECTACULAR - EXCITING - ROMANTIC - COZY - AMAZING!!!	As guests at the OPUS HOTEL MONTREAL in May 2009, for a very special occasion, we both felt very welcome and given all the attention a King &amp; Queen expect plus more. We felt totally relaxed and comfortable. We want to thank both management and staff for a wonderful and memorable stay.Until our next visitDoreen &amp; Louis Schlomowitz"
22,1587,Jul 12 2009 	Awesome summer getaway	This hotel is conveniently located off St Laurent Blvd which is packed with Montreal's top restaurants &amp; nightclubs. We literally walked out the door and into the heart of the action. It would highly recommend the Opus Hotel in Montreal!
23,1587,"Jul 6 2009 	For inexperienced wealthy travelers only - others go elsewhere	1- Strict check-in timing 3:00 pm and not a minute earlier - nowhere to freshen up meanwhile; staff was not accomodating at all, especially with our 3 year-old. 2- Our main suitcase was missing from the luggage brought to our room - had to convince them we were missing a suitcase and then wait for them to find it 3- staff instructed to knock insistently on suite door even if &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign is hanging on door knob, in order to check the mini-bar.... employee was litterally banging on the door until we opened it and was not about to apologize! 4- breakfast at Holiday Inn is better than what Opus served, even the bagels were old! 5- $30CDN/per day for valet parking is more than any other Montreal hotel. 6- weekend bar/lounge music made hallway frames shake - room was quiet though 7- cleaning was average, although we had asked for new towels, our old ones were put back on the rack and the staff did not provide coffee after the first day. We have traveled extensively throughout the world with and without children and this hotel is among the worst &quot;luxury&quot; hotels we have ever stayed at. Needless to say, Montreal has a lot more and better luxury hotels and we will be more than happy to explore them next time. We go there twice a year at least and will not soon forget this $400CDN+/night nightmare!"
24,1587,"Jul 5 2009 	What a great experience	The Opus Montreal was truly a refreshing change from the large hotel chains I stay at for business. From the time the cab drops one odf, the experience begins- One enters this inviting interesting lobby, one is greeted with a welcoming smile at receptions. the room are faulous and have a modern yet relaxing feels about them.Suko is a very social bar. Dinner at KOKO is a must-fabulous food and fabulous decor-WOWif you are in a quandry as to where to go for dinner just ask Patrick-his recommendations were all great-Thanks!All in all a fantastic experienceWE WILL BE BACK"
25,1587,"Jun 8 2009 	All show--don't go	Like many other reviewers, we too were kept awake until the wee hours by an entirely unacceptable level of noise. Functions until 3am, then people talking loudly in the halls until 5--beyond the pale. We got the &quot;Oh, didn't they tell you&quot; runaround when we talked to the front desk the first morning after, and got parking and room service comped, but that hardly makes up for the one, primary, non-negotiable service a hotel must provide: a good night's sleep!Service was so-so outside of that. Room service was unimpressive. The price for room was fair; other prices less so.Overall, had the impression of what a hotel run by Apple computer (or Steve Jobs) would be like: pretty to look at, entirely (and overly) trendy, but short on delivery.If you must go, be SURE you are not on the side of the hotel facing the bar/function courtyard."
26,1587,"May 27 2009 	48 hours without any sleep!	Every room on our side of the hotel was over their night club, which had events both Saturday and Sunday night that lasted until after 3 a.m. in the morning. The ear plugs next to the bed did nothing to help with the fact that the room was vibrating. It was truly horrendous. The hotel itself is very nice, but for the price I'd expect to be able to get some sleep. Never again."
27,1587,"May 7 2009 	perfect location from all the attractions.	We recently had a guys weekend in Montreal and stayed at the Opus hotel. This was a perfect locale / setting for the weekend. The hotel itself is located at sherbrooke and stlaurent, which are the two prime streets in montreal, intersecting - Within a short walk in any direction is incredible nightlife, restaurants and shopping. The hotel has a sleek, chic boutique feel with very friendly, non-pretentious staff. The rooms are very tastefully decorated. On the main floor with special access for guests is Koko restaurant which turns into a very happening nightspot post dinner. I travel frequently within the US and Canada and it definitely is one of the better hotels i have stayed in (south beach chill feel with a subtle new york coolness to it)."
28,1587,"May 6 2009 	Designer ear plugs at the bedside a real tipoff!	We appreciated the perfect location, impeccable room design, and lush lobby of Opus Montreal, but the box of designer ear plugs at our bedside was a real tipoff! We heard every conversation in the rooms on either side of us, every door slamming in the halls, every elevator ding, and every piece of luggage being rolled down the hallways. It was just unacceptable for a hotel that is so first-rate in other ways. Just appreciate the art direction of the lobby, the outside deck, and the restaurant, but don't stay here."
29,1587,"Apr 28 2009 	Stylish comfortable hotel.	Very comfortable room, lots of desk space, nice bathroom arrangement. Noise wasn't an issue, but likely because we were there on a Sunday night. The restaurant/bar is certainly set up for loud, swank nights. Restaurant for dinner was very good, the quality lived up to the price. Continental breakfast buffet was not bad. All staff were helpful and pleasant.WiFi in lobby was iffy; didn't purchase WiFi in room. Hotel is right across from Just for Laughs venue."
30,1587,"Apr 20 2009 	Noise Level is Unacceptable: Higher End Hotel with Low End experience	I too made the mistake of not checking this site before booking the hotel. To be sure, the public areas are very nice and we found the staff courteous and helpful. The restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent. But the noise from the bar was awful. We were placed in the room right over the bar. The furniture rumbled, the lights shook and the decibel level was so loud, the ear plugs were useless. (Honestly, ear plugs....at a high end hotel?) The staff are well aware of the problem but we were not advised before we booked the room. I complained and asked to be moved. We were told that the hotel was full and this was not possible. The supervisor offered a 50 percent discount for the room. I declined saying that 50 a percent discount for half a night's sleep was unacceptable. We received a full refund. To my mind, the compensation we received was a bare minimum. A hotel that is unable to guarantee conditions that support sleep, shouldn't be in business as a hotel."
31,1587,"Mar 2 2009 	Wonderful Weekend Stay!	The Hotel Opus is a true gem! I rank it as one of the top hotels that I've ever visited. The staff and their level of service were remarkable, making the stay even more enjoyable. Koko, the restaurant at the hotel, is a must when you visit - the food there was delicious! I will definitel stay at Opus again."
32,1587,"Dec 30 2008 	What a great Choice!!!!	From the moment we got there we LOVED it!Katherine was very helpful with the reservation (including dinner reservations at Koko), Ralph the bellboy and valet guy was just great.... We didn't want to leave....Rooms are amazing, Koko was delicious and trendy.This is the RIGHT WAY to experience Montreal!We will be back for sure!"
33,1587,"Dec 30 2008 	High style mediocre service	The Opus had loads of style and a great location. The bed was comfortable and the shower was absolutely lovely with plenty of hot water.On the downside, the service was sub-par. The doorman was rarely at the door, our room wasn't made up at four o'clock in the afternoon and the bar wasn't open on Sunday afternoon when we went down for a pre-dinner cocktail.A word of warning for light sleepers, the hotel bar is quite loud at times. On Saturday night, we could hear the music from the bar in our third floor room. Although there were earplugs in the bathroom (someone must know of the issue!), you might want to request a room far away from the bar if this might keep you awake!"
34,1587,"Oct 27 2008 	Opus Montreal was great	This hotel felt very trendy/funky without being pretentious. The rooms were really big, and the beds were so comfortable, it was hard to get up in the morning. The turn down service left green tea chocolates...pretty cool.Definitely felt like you were part of the action; the restaurant downstairs always seemed to be busy, and became a late-night hot spot for locals."
35,1587,"Oct 27 2008 	Loved Everything	I stayed at Opus for one nite in September and was impressed from the moment I pulled up to the curb. The Valet took my baggage and keys right away and led me into the reception area to check in. They were incredibly professional and very welcoming to the hotel. Once I got to my room - I actually had to snap a couple of pictures to send to my wife right away as I wished that she could have joined me on the trip. It was amazing!!! Then I proceeded down to Koko for drinks and dinner later that afternoon and was even more impressed by the surrounding, great service and amazing food and cocktails.All in all - I would say that staying at this hotel is a must if you are going to Montreal on business or pleasure - I cant wait for my next trip to be scheduled.Thank you to everyone at Opus!!"
36,1587,"Oct 18 2008 	Pretty on the outside....	Very pretty to look at, I actually really loved the decor. Pinks and blacks. When I arrived well after check in almost 5pm my room wasn't ready. Front desk informed me the shower in my room was being repaired and it would be ready shortly. I was in fabulous mood and decided to wander around the neighbourhood. Upon returning front desk apologized. After checking in and setting up my laptop I noticed my internet was not complimentary as was promised by the entertainment sales manager. I called the front desk and they took care of the problem promptly. A few minutes later there was a knock at door. I was expecting an apology favour (considering what a high profile boutique hotel the opus is) only to have my door opened by two engineers apologizing as they didn't know the room was occupied. Then a few minutes later a woman from housekeeping opens my door (no knock what so ever) sees me and without an apology or any explanation shuts the door. How unorganized was this place! It blew my mind. Aren't we in the year 2008? I thought this chic boutique hotel would of at least had some sort of system to notify two different staff members that a room was occupied. From that second forward I felt the need to put my double dead bolt on. Unreal. Sunday breakfast was dead in their restaurant. Our server was lovely and it was so sad to see the place empty. Over all this hotel is slick and very pretty but not worth the price for the lack of organization I experienced."
37,1587,"Oct 11 2008 	Party On!	We give this hotel three stars because as a hotel it is great, but it really depends upon what you are looking for. If you want a great place to party hop from, this is it! In seconds you are in one of the hippest bar scenes in Montreal, including an '80s club with people dancing on the bar, and several others that I am way to old for (I'm 38). For a rockin' getaway with very little sleep, this is great. My husband and I did not get in until 3:30 am either night. The first night we slept soundly-- no noise (Friday). Then NEXT night, there was a full-fledged party on our floor because of the wedding party staying in the hotel. Well, you can imagine that we wanted to sleep. Oh well, we couldn't, despite the ear plugs that are given out as a hospitality!  To cut down on the noise I suggest you ask for a room that is not above the bar or which opens up over the swank open-air bar in the hotel's lower level."
38,1587,"Oct 4 2008 	Noise is indeed an issue here be cautious!	I stayed at the Opus for 4 nights. When I entered my first room I was pleasantly surprised with how modern it was great decor, nice accents but unfortunately bad lighting.. the rooms were light deprived. My first room was overlooking St Laurent near the club. When midnight came i was awakened by NOISE! people fighting on the street, dance music and the INSANE beats of bass on the speakers. As others have mentioned on this board,, its Loud!! First night i got 2 hours sleep :( they encourage you to wear their ear plugs to sleep but cmon who wants to do that. The next day i complained and they moved me to a quieter room. Much better! My remaining 3 nights there was fine. Free wireless was provided in the lobby. The Japanese restaurant on the ground floor had delicious food! the best Steak and frites. Try the complimentary coffee machine on the ground floor, tea, expresso, cafe latte. Delicious chocolates are placed each night on your pillow.If you are a light sleeper even a heavier one please take caution with the noise. One last thing you can't beat this location! Its in the heart of everthing."
39,1587,"Sep 15 2008 	way too loud!	now i have to confess i didnt look at this website before booking this hotel - big mistake. we had a room on the first floor facing the inner courtyard aka the outside bar area. i cant believe people are stupid enough to stay at this hotel - they must have been like me and not read any reviews. it was so [--] loud - esp sat night when the weather was good and the bar in full swing. on the sat night, after having an admitedly quite tasty and reasonably priced cocktail at said bar we went to our room at 11pm, tried to watch a movie which still couldnt drown out the noise from the bar. it reminded me of staying in miami beach. in actual fact we were so exhausted every night we actually feel asleep - with the earplugs in of course. its a great area for shopping - but would never stay here again, unless perhaps in the winter when the outside bar area will be covered in snow and hence no music. the room was quite nice, very &quot;cool&quot; with chocolates every night and l'occtaine bath products, but the lighting was bad."
40,1587,"Aug 29 2008 	Real Disappointment	Having had a friendly telephone conversation with a member of the reservations staff to book my stay, I was looking forward to my first visit to Opus. The hotel's location is convenient to explore the city but the building is situated on a busy cross-roads with constant traffic heard throughout the building. The first suite I was shown to did not have a bath as requested and I was moved to a small standard room overlooking the courtyard. Luckily it was a Monday, the receptionist did not recommend rooms overlooking the courtyard from Thursday to Sunday due to the late night party in the bar below. I stayed in the room for 3 nights before moving to a suite with a bath which I had originally booked. The room was spacious but painted a lurid orange and overlooked a side street littered with refuse. The room was badly lit and had no privacy from onlookers. A majority of the staff were very unfriendly and two receptionists in particular were extremely inefficient in carrying out simple guest requests. The highlight of this hotel were the porters / bell boys who always had a smile of their faces, nothing was to much trouble for them. Shame about the others. A real disappointment."
41,1587,"Aug 23 2008 	Rock and Roll Hotel... You will NOT sleep.	I booked this hotel on Hotwire for a very low rate, otherwise the few bad reviews would have kept me away. Unfortunately, the bad reviews here are 100% correct so let me just recap.Don't go to this hotel if you plan on sleeping at night. Maybe if you want to sleep from 5am until noon, but otherwise forget it. The bass from the club is so loud it sounds like it's in your room (and our room was no where near the club!) Also, there were some people who snuck out onto the rooftop right outside our window and camped out there until 5am. Yes folks, 5 am - laughing and hollering and stomping their feet! The hotel puts earplugs in the room but they didn't help at all. Also our Hvac unit was broken so our room was 82 degrees. Phone was broken too so forget about calling the front desk to rat out the people on the roof.Pros: Door men are very helpful and friendly, especially Tony. We did complain about the intense heat in our room which the hotel staff did fix. We also complained about the rooftop partiers the next morning and within moments, staff was on site screwing the windows shut so that it couldn't happen again.Cons: WAY too much noise. Too many defects. Dull dim lighting in the bathroom so you can't make sure you look decent before you go out. The hotwire rate was nice, but you really do get what you pay for sometimes."
42,1587,Aug 6 2008 	I Loved it!	I loved everything about this hotel ... the location can't be beat ... our room was beautiful ... the service was great ... the restaurant was fantastic and the the outdoor lounge was perfect for spending time with friends having some cocktails and people watching!
43,1587,"Jul 20 2008 	great stay	had a great stay here recently. very modern, hip hotel. great for young (35 and down, no kids) travelers. didn't get a chance to check out the bars and restaurants in the hotel, but they seem very chic. rooms are very clean and decor is modern. within walking distance of restaurants and boutiques. not close to major tourist attractions, but close to metro station which is easy to navigate. service was great; front desk staff very nice and helpful. only complaints are that the rooms are very dark and breakfast is not included."
44,1587,"Jul 16 2008 	Amazing Location OK Hotel	I am not a high maintenance hotel stayer. I like modern, clean rooms with a location central to my interests. The Opus delivered on both of those. Having said that, there was one BIG problem. The sound!I am a 30 year old woman. I love to party and stay out late...however, when I am ready to go to sleep, I want to be able to. There are 2 sides to this hotel. One faces the ultra hip, posh, overly priced restaurant/club Koko..the other faces the busy street. I don't know how the sound is on the street side, but on the club side it's obnoxiously loud!! Until 3-4 am on the weekends and about 2 on the weeknights. One day, we had been sightseeing all day and wanted to ttake a nap to be ready to go out later. There was a wedding in the courtyard of the restaurant and they started playing music at 5-6 pm (and it was still going when we got home late night). The music was typical annoying wedding music and top it all off, we had to hear all the speeches in surround sound. The volume was 19 on a scale of 1-20. We were very irritated and did not feel rested upon leaving this hotel. The staff is on the snobby side, and definitely cater more to the trendsetters, than the average joes. Room service stops serving at 11 pm..at least if you're going to force me to stay awake hearing your music..feed me!BUT the location is fantastic!! A few blocks from St Denis and the Latin Quarter, right on St Laurent with limitless restaurants and bars, a few blocks from Old Montreal, Prince Arthur Street, St Catherine, the metro, buses etcI would not return to this hotel."
45,1587,"Jul 9 2008 	Loved  loved loved the Opus!!	My husband and I stayed at the Opus Hotel in Monteal -June 27-30th while enjoying the Montreal Jazz Festival. It was hard to leave the hotel!!! From entering the lobby, we had incredible service right from the moment we entereded the front doors. The front desk staff were efficient, welcoming and very polite. Security is great, since you require your room key to access your floor inside the elevator. Decor is great, ultra modern, a nice change from the &quot;typical&quot; decor of hotels. There is an area, just adjacent to the lobby where there is a free,fresh coffee and tea bar with very comfy sofas and chairs and free wireless hookups.The various daily papers are free as well.  Our room was just perfect!!! The colors are all spectacular and each is different, hot pink, mustard, chartrusse, and our was purple, mauve and grey! We loved it- the king bed was incredible, the linens were the best I've ever slept on in any hotel! (HMMMM- do they sell them?) The room was very large, comfortable, and a bonus was that the window opened-we stayed on the 4th floor overtop the covered patio area and off to a side street. We did not have any noise problems. Our window when closed was very soundproof. We also found an &quot;O&quot; umbrella in our closet - which came in very handy. The bath products are great, they use L'Occitane en Provence- very luxurious! Nice white fluffy bathrobes (with a lime green &quot;O&quot; -very cute)- huge shower was a nice treat too! The lighting in the room is great - no ceiling lights, but instead, lamps and recessed lighting in one wall behind the bed. In the evening we had turndown service with decadant chocolates on our pillow, soft romantic lighting, the beautiful copper roman shade drawn- and the silver ice bucket full- ready for our nightcaps!! The lounge and restaurant are elegant- the outdoor courtyard very stylish and one floor below at Suko's Lounge- the outdoor patio is just decadant- chaise lounges and pillows surrounded by a great garden area, accessable right to the street. We were only blocks away from the Jazz Fest and steps away from Old Montreal, fantastic shops, restaurants (Thanks to Fritz!! for the tips on breakfast and lunch spots!!) wine bars, great patios, I could go on and on. But bottom line, if you want to stay in a GREAT hotel, in a perfect location - you cannot miss with the Opus Hotel. We heard that they have an Opus in Vancouver and can't wait to experience the BC one soon!!"
46,1587,"Jul 5 2008 	Loved the Opus	Just returned from a two night stay at the Opus and could not have been happier with our choice. As always I use Tripadvisor as my guide before booking a hotel and although there have been a couple of poor ratings for this hotel it certainly was not our experience. The hotel is very modern, clean and staff extremely helpful from the front desk staff to the doormen. We did not experience any of the problems with sound in the room at all.Location is excellent.The only complaint I have is that the food and bar prices are &quot;way&quot; too high and would definitely not avail myself of either the restaurant or bar.Would stay here again."
47,1587,"Jun 3 2008 	Maybe for some people...	I booked my stay over a month in advance with Tablet Hotels. The money had been paid to the hotel in it's entirety 3 weeks before I had even arrived, yet there was no room waiting for me.I immediately noticed that Opus is definitely going for a specific clientele. Young professionals, or celebrities with money to burn will enjoy extra-special attention from the staff, while those like myself will get a bit of the old 'upturned nose' treatment. When I was finally able to get a room one of the concierge at the front desk said to me that he'd like to find me a quieter room, when he saw the one that was assigned by the woman who had originally greeted us, but was abruptly cut off by her as she told him that our room was &quot;fine&quot;.Beware that if you plan on going to bed before 3am, half of the hotel's rooms overlook the courtyard which Koko (the upscale yuppie hotel restaurant/nightclub) opens onto. Our room was the floor above the courtyard and was vibrating from the bass in the restaurant's sound-system and we could clearly hear the people in the courtyard smoking and yelling to one another over the music. When I called to ask for a different room, I was told that the hotel was &quot;Sold Out&quot;. This is a *likely story*.The decoration/design of this hotel is very trendy, and while it is nice right now, it is very dark and will date quickly.If you like to stay up late snorting coke, drinking awesome martinis and partying with other yuppies, you will love Opus Hotel in Montreal. This is not a family hotel, nor is it a hotel for people who like a peaceful or relaxing weekend away from home."
48,1587,"May 28 2008 	Nice Clean Friendly	My boyfriend and I visited Montreal and stayed at the Opus Hotel Montreal this past Memorial Day weekend. We were pleased with the hotel as far as cleanliness, friendliness (especially the front desk) and location. We were able to walk to many sights including museums, restaurants, etc. Everything else was a few minutes car ride away.Amenities in the room were L'Occitane and were very nice. The only complaint I have was the $26/night charge for valet parking. Even in a big city, this was too much in my opinion. Otherwise, we enjoyed our stay (the complimentary coffee/espresso/capppuccino machine in the lobby was a very nice touch). The bar/lounge downstairs is nice, though the cocktails were quite pricey. However, we expected that in a big city. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
49,1587,"May 28 2008 	Do NOT Believe the other reviews WORST HOTEL WE EVER STAYED IN.	I am convinced that the other reviews that show this property in a positive light are either fake, written by management, or the hotel has some sort of policy to reward this fake praise. For the first time ever, I was completely duped by Tripadvisor, usually my wife and I have a great experience and the reviews are spot on, NOT this time. All I can say is, please, listen to me, do not stay at this property if you value your time, money, and sleep. Here is a list of the defects:1. The Hotel has terrible sound proofing. The club blasts club music until 3:30 and you will hear every word, feel every bass note, and generally feel like you're in the club even on floor 5. Even between rooms, expect to hear the neighbors having sex, and everything going on outside on the street. This is a problem ACKNOWLEDGED by management, which is why the put earplugs under your pillow. 2. The new eatery, KOKO, is a complete joke. In such a city which is rich in culinary skill, do not torture yourself by dining at this feeble attempt at gourmet. There was a mistake on our order, and the waiter then charged us to bring out the correct item. When asked to get a manager, he refused to call one. 3. The rooms have terrible lighting. No recessed lighting, and the fixtures are sparce, and the bulbs were burnt out during our stay. 3 days and 2 calls later to front desk for repair, still no lights. 4. Our safe didn't work. 5. Our egg room service breakfast came with no fork, knives, or napkin. 6. The finishes are very cheap, laminate counter tops on all the furniture, with the dark oak front edgband veneer peeling off in many places. Cheap doors, cheap trim, the bed frame has unfinished MDF showing around as the mattress doesn't cover it completely. Trend forward design gone very bad, think an &quot;IKEA hotel&quot;, but not as good. 7. The HVAC units are in room and very loud. 8. Our telephone didn't work, and was not fixed after 2 days. 9. Did I mention that you won't sleep?Overall, this place was a joke. When I was at the reception complaining, there were 2 people ahead of me, and I overheard them complaining for the same things. It defies logic how there are so many positive reviews. Save your money and your vacation time, stay elsewhere."
50,1587,"May 27 2008 	Great location good value contemporary hotel.	Perfect location if you're going to take advantage of the restaurants and shopping on St. Laurent. Intimate boutique hotel with a similar feel of the W, but a little more subdued. I like it and would definitely consider staying here again. Clean rooms, good sized and comfortable."
51,1587,"May 18 2008 	Great design hotel downtown Montreal	The Opus Montreal is located next to many bars, restaurants and shops. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and new like the rest of the hotel. The staff is friendly and attentive. Food at the restaurant is very good and the bar is nice."
52,1587,"May 7 2008	Hotel Opus - A Work in Progess - For the Better	The Opus is sleek, modern, airy, spacious, and dimly lit from the lobby all the way up to the hotel room. The staff is very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous.The Opus is in the midst of constructing their restaurant that is expected to open by the end of May. Until then, at street level there is the Suco bar and lounge with an outdoor patio facing St. Laurent where you can enjoy great tunes, drinks, and tapas.If you are a light sleeper, make sure to use the ear plugs provided as the windows are not very soundproof and do not keep out the street noise. Regardless, the beds are very comfortable and the hotel room offers all of the latest modern amenities.Restaurants and shops along Ste-Laurent are all within a short walking distance from the Opus. For additional restaurants and shops and if you are not keen on walking, a short cab ride will get you to Old Montreal/the Port, Crescent Street, Ste-Catherine, and Ste-Denis.Nearby Dining: For a truly authentic excellent Italian meal cooked like mamma, be sure to make a reservation at Da Emma (514.392.1568) in Old Montreal. For a filling breakfast (served until 3:00 p.m.), lunch or dinner, check out the funky Avenue on Mt-Royal Avenue East (plus two additional locations) and have patience as they do not take reservations and there is always a line-up. It is worth the wait."
53,1587,"Jan 4 2008 	Very hip - A 'Must Stay' Hotel	This is a fantstic hotel - very chic, in a great location near everything, the staff is awesome and so extremely helpful. The rooms were so luxurious it was hard to leave the hotel and explore Montreal. We went for our 1st wedding anniversary and felt pampered the whole time we were at The Opus. We will definitely be staying at The Opus on every trip we make back to Montreal. We had a fantastic experience and wouldn't change anything about the hotel."
54,1587,"Dec 12 2007 	Awesome spot!	I stayed here for my bachelor party with about ten other guys. The hotel was very chic and yes I did say chic. Front desk staff helpful, and the doorman let us know all the good hot spots! Beds were comfy, rooms were neat. The TV/computer combo was a little hard to figure out after a bottle of alcohol had been consumed, but I'm sure it worked fine. They were very accomadating when asked for a lot of ice, a HUGE tray filled with ice was delivered in no time at all. All in all a great stay. I would return to the Opus becuase of its proximity to the local nightlife, and if it wasn't close, it was a quick cab ride wherever you wanted to go!"
55,1587,"Nov 26 2007	Pretty good	Excellent staff from the bellhops to the front desk, everyone was super courteous and very quick to help you out. The hotel decor was pretty nice, they are goin for that trendy NY look. We stayed in the executive suite which was two rooms, a living room and then bedroom with two bathrooms with included baths/showers. Lighting was bleh, to dark for me. Overall nice hotel room, looks like it had been partied in pretty good though but didn't bother me, hehe. Was expecting an IPOD dock of some sort, but i improvised and bought one of those ipod headphone jack to audio input wires and plugged into the back of the tv and bam! IPOD. Have a ton of pics of the room if anyone is interested."
56,1587,Nov 19 2007 	Exceptional!	First time visit to Montreal and what an incredible city! And the trendy Opus Montreal matches its host city in everyway. The dcor in the rooms and lobby was vibrant and fun. Staff were friendly and very helpful with directions plus some outstanding dinner recommendations. Location was perfect  right next to a whole bunch of great shops and restaurants/clubs.
57,1587,"Nov 18 2007 	Dark but overall pleasant place to stay	I stayed at Hotel Godin (now Opus) twice earlier this year--once in February and once in June. Both were business trips.Some aspects of this hotel I really liked, others not.The rooms ARE dark, mostly due to concrete ceilings that mean no overhead lights. (Plus everything is painted in gray tones.) Also, huge windows are shrouded in very dark curtains. This might be great if you need pitch-dark to sleep, but a bit oppressive for being in the room at other times. I immediately opened all curtains, and that helped, but people could then look right in, from the place across the way, so I had to remember to change in the bathroom or close the curtains!Both times I was in what they call a &quot;Privilege&quot; room--that's the smallest. Bed was great--that's important! And chocolate treats at turn-down were a nice touch.The pictures show a bathtub, but neither room I had included one--only a shower, although a spacious one.There is a nice long desk, which was good for working. One trip I was able to negotiate internet to be included in the room cost, but the other time I had to pay a daily fee. No coffee maker, but there is free coffee in the lobby downstairs. Room service is - as you might expect - expensive. Plus, fairly small portions. Fortunately, there are lots of places to eat within walking distance. Still, overall it was a pretty good experience."
58,1587,"Nov 16 2007	Mini Ian Shrager?	Lots of rave reviews, but I thought it was trying a bit too hard to be 'New York'......constant 'cool' hotel music everywhere you go, the bar just doesn't quite cut it.....not saying it was bad - it was fine - but it aint Schrager/Stark even tho it wants to be.But having said that, at $179 maybe you cant expect the real thing?"
59,1587,"Nov 14 2007 	Location Location Location	For my first visit to Montreal, the Opus Hotel was the ultimate choice because it's location was close to everything. We only had a few days to stay in Montreal, so the location of our hotel was very important. The Opus Montreal was a short walk to shopping, and had many restaurants nearby. Most of our travel to and from the hotel was by taxi and was usually under a $10 fare, whether it was to a restaurant, nightclub, or the Bell Centre hockey arena.The rooms were funky and spacious but we did not spend a lot of time in them as we were enjoying everything cultural that Montreal has to offer. When we needed a dinner reservation, the staff were friendly, helpful, and bi-lingual.I will stay there again."
60,1587,"Nov 14 2007 	Awesome.	From the moment we got out of the taxi, the Opus staff were very attentative and helpful. The entire time it felt as though we were receiving special treatment - even though we were regular guests. The lobby is beautiful, but not over done - they have a small bar/lounge in the lobby area and a larger bar downstairs - so great for pre-dinner drinks. The rooms are unique, new and stylish - loved the concrete ceilings. They are opening a larger bar in the spring which will make the Opus even more of a hot-spot. I highly recommend this hotel, and I will be staying there every time I go to Montreal."
61,1587,"Nov 11 2007 	Exactly what I wanted!!!	Couldn't have asked for anything better! The service was excellent, the employees were courteous, and the room exceded all expectations!! Highly Recommended! I've been to a couple hotels in montreal, nothing compared to Opus!!!"
62,1587,"Oct 29 2007 	Hip Cool Great Location	Perfect spot if you're looking for a hip hotel located in the heart of the coolest neighbourhood in Montreal filled with great stores, restaurants, etc. Staff was very friendly, rooms were clean, quiet, high end with nice personal touches. Great bar scene!"
63,1587,"Oct 22 2007 	Loved the Opus Montreal!	Amazing staff, very helpful and friendly. Opus is very chic and modern. I was traveling for business and found the location was perfect---very centrally located to all the main attractions and neighbourhoods. Some hotels have fantastic lobbies and then boring rooms but not at Opus! My room was amazing and so were the bathroom products. I especially enjoyed turn-down service; each night when I returned from a day of meetings there were delicious chocolates on my pillow! Love, love, love Opus Montreal and will definitely be staying there again when I am in Montreal for work (or even just for fun!). Note: Room service was very good, the tip/delivery charge is included on the bill so you don't pay all those hidden charges that come with most room service bills. If you are traveling alone like I was, have a drink in the lobby lounge, the staff are really friendly and offer great wine suggestions."
64,1587,"Oct 21 2007	romantic getaway	My husband and I spent our 1 year wedding anniversary at Opus. it was truly a romantic experience. The hotel itself is just beautiful and the staff was just great. We stopped for a few drinks at Suco bar which is in Opus hotel. The ambience was great. The bar tenders were so friendly and ready to serve you whenever you needed a drink. The music was really good. It was that lounging music you want to hear when you are out having a good time. The music wasn't too lound like some bars that you can't even hear yourself think. You can actually have a conversation with the people you are with. Right after a fun evening we headed to our room which was just to die for. Modern, clean and comfortable. I just wanted to stay in there comfy bed all day long. The room was a good size and the bathroom was bigger then the room.(almost) Deep bathtub, huge shower and 2 sinks so I didn't have to fight over it with my husband. Ha! Ha!. We pre ordered our breakfast the night before, but I forgot to write the time I wanted it served to our room. So when I woke up I called reception and they told me I forgot to write a time and they didn't want to call us to wake us up, which I found very respectfull of them. Within minutes our breakfast arrived on a table with flours, fruit, croissants, muffins, juice, coffee and of course my bacon and eggs. The presentation was just beautiful and added to our romatic weekend. All in all I reccommend Opus Montreal to not only couples but to anyone who wants to stay at a really nice hotel and have a good evening at the bar.It also is located in the heart of town town Montreal, which is the place to be. I defiately would go back. Maybe every anniversary!"
65,1587,"Oct 15 2007	Amazing Energy!	The OPUS Montreal pulses with an amazing energy. For a trendy boutique hotel the rooms are a lovely size - with great features including an amazing tub/shower room! (check out the cool reversible door- hinge on the wc/bedroom door!) This time it was only my husband and me, but after peeking into one of the suites (complete with murphy bed) we've vowed to go back soon with kids! And talk about location... you want the heart off Montreal - you got it!!!"
66,1587,"Oct 9 2007 	Outstanding...	only amazing things to say about the hotel, the property, and the staff. there is a really great story about the history of the building which definately adds to the experience. located in a wonderful, central part of town. we were there is the fall and it was just beautiful.nothing bad to say about opus montreal."
67,1587,"Oct 4 2007 	Hip happening hot	Montreal's hippest hotel. Incredibly friendly (and gorgeous) staff. As someone else said, it's a celebrity haven - you never know who you'll meet in the lobby or the elevator. The beds are heavenly."
68,1587,Sep 28 2007	Loved Opus Montreal!!!!!!!!	Last weekend was my bachelorette party and a bunch of us stayed at the opus hotel in montreal...BEST hotel EVER!!!! The staff is amazing!... the rooms are incredible! and the service rocked! I had a great time and a very enjoyable stay!! I recommend the opus montreal to everyone and anyone!! you can't go wrong!!
69,1587,"Sep 25 2007 	Celebrities everywhere! Best location!	I recently went to Montreal to see the Beastie Boys concert and stayed at the Opus Montreal. I was blown away to see that I was staying in the same hotel as the Beastie Boys... and what more? I even met Bjork in the lounge!!!! All the shopping and restaurants were around the corner and to top it all of I was greeted and taken care of with such professionalism, and slept in the best bed ever! Easily my best vacation, will be returning for the Jazz Festival!"
70,1587,"Sep 11 2007 	Excellent Boutique Hotel	I am a gay traveller and also owner of a Travel Agency. The OPUS Hotel Montreal has exceeded my expectations, not only on the design, services and location, but also on the Guest and Customer Service. The staff is very friendly, warm and welcoming.I would recommend any of you seeking the best value option to stay in Montreal the OPUS Hotel not only as a guest/client of the hotel but also as a travel expert.Excellent location, walking distance from the main touristic atractions, the restaurant districts, and the gay quarters for the gay travellers.FYI it is not a Gay hotel, but you can sence the friendly ambience in the air.I give them a 09 point out of 10.Carlos Melia"
71,1587,"Sep 9 2007 	Absolutely Amazing !	As of hotel staying, you might call me a professional. I stay in hotels more than in my own home ! If I had the chance to choose a permanent destination, Opus Montreal would definitely be it !From the warmful welcoming to the prompt check-out, my &quot;too short&quot; stay at Opus charmed me, from top to bottom !Considering the busy Labor Day weekend, the staff was available for any requests and ready to perform backward flips for all my little personal attentions. I felt just at home in the beautiful rooms... major plus with the glass shower !I could go on but will keep it short. Opus MTL is THE boutique hotel to choose to keep a sane mind about your staying needs !Thank you Opus !Ian RenaudFood Critic for Gastronomie, Weekend.ca"
72,1587,"Sep 8 2007 	Fantastic Opus Montreal	From the moment my family and I (two small children 4yrs and 5yrs old) entered the hotel, we were welcomed with open arms. The staff was very courteous and professional. All the elements from the lighting to the dcor were warm, welcoming and very hip.The rooms have an element of style that made our stay very pleasant. My daughters love the comfy beds and so did I. The staff was always quick to respond to all our needs with a smile. I will be returning to Montral very soon and I wont be looking to stay anywhere else."
73,1587,"Sep 7 2007	Loved the Opus Montreal (formerly Hotel Godin)	We just returned from an extended weekend stay with the Opus Montreal (formerly Hotel Godin). It was a very conveniently location -- close to the Metro and restaurants. The staff members were very professional, courteous, helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and nicely decorated. We especially loved the evening bed turn down treats!"
74,1587,"Sep 6 2007 	Cool Modern Hotel Great Location	Hip boutique hotel. Our room was nicely equipped. basically a queen bed with two bed-side tables, a table and chairs, a very large, very long polished metal mirror that took up one whole wall, flat screen TV, long wood consoe (12' long) was very useful. The only downside of the hotel was the room was very dark, even with all the lights on, it was occasionally difficult to read. Hip and romantic though. The walls and the cieling are poured concrete, very dark. The toilet was in a separate room from the shower/vanity area. The shower/vanity was very nice with a large shower area with glass tile, the vanity had a large raised vessell sink and plenty of room on each side. Real positive was the location right on St. Laurent and Sherbrooke, close to Old Montreal, downtown, and our favorite part the plateau, St. Laurent, St. Denis, Mt. Royal. Very convenient location, helpful staff. WiFi did not work in room, had to go to the lobby for that, a bit annoying. Fitness center was small, but nicely equipped and never crowded and open 24 hrs. I specifically do not eat in the restaurant of the hotel I'm staying in (part of the fun is getting out and about), so I have no opinon on that. Convenient valet parking, very helpful. One Word Equity: Location. with a nice dose of hipness. Would definately recommend to the right person (not my parents) looking for a nicely located, moderately priced, hip boutique type hotel, but would not be everyone's cup of tea."
75,1587,"Sep 6 2007	Worst Managed Hotel in Montreal	I am a huge fan of boutique hotels and I travel to Montreal frequently. Opus (formerly known as the 'Godin') is quite possibly the worst hotel I have ever been to. The service from check-in to check-out was tedious, annoying and unprofessional.My credit card statement showed that they had charged my account double the amount that they were supposed to. It took two weeks and numerous litigation for me to receive my money.Funny thing - is that I had heard about the hotel being poorly managed, but I didn't listen - BIG mistakeUntil they wipe out their management system - stay clear!"
76,1587,"Sep 4 2007 	Stunning!	A must stay!The perfect location! Close to downtown shopping, nightlife, restaurants and the plateau, a must see of Montreal. Beautiful and trendy decor, professional, friendly staff.A must stay in Montreal."
77,1587,"Jul 30 2007 	Opus Hotels expands in Montreal	A recent addition to the Opus Hotel Group. The former Godin Hotel Montreal is a v. good place to rest your head. Designed by Canadian Architects Yabu Pushelburg it is well thought out and planed. The basic rooms (Prestige) are large. The service is friendly and professional. My complaint here is that the hotel seems understaffed and requests seem to take a a long time. Well located near the St Laurent restaurant scene the hotels own restaurant is not yet open for business. My only real complaint was the poor quality of the breakfast buffet. Un inspiring choices, cheap linen and poor coffee. Come on guys you are in Montreal. Montreal bagels and pastries, fressh fruit and linen and lose the stainless steel serving bowls ! All in all a good choice. If your journey takes you to Montreal look over The Sofitel, W Hotel and in the old town Le St James,Nelligan and The Saint Sulpice. Enjoy Montreal !"
78,1587,"Jul 29 2007 	Great location	The location of the Godin, sorry Opus (the hotel had just changed ownership as I was staying there), is superb.It's about 4 blocks away from the main shopping street (St. Catherine) and right across the hotel, there's a street full of great bars and restaurants. The location cant be beat, there's everything nearby that you might want. While the hotel is located next to a busy street, once you get indoors, it's all peace and quiet.The lobby has a bar in the evenings and there's always free coffee available which was quite good. I ended up drinking a lot of it since the I couldn't get the internet connection working for my laptop up in my room. The wifi access in the lobby is free and fast. To use the internet in the rooms you have to activate it via the tv and it didnt work at all for me or any of my colleagues.The room I stayed in was spacious and had a massive comfy bed. Its pretty dark in the room and the only window was facing an closeby office and the street, from where one could see into the room, so the shades had to be kept down most of the time. The decoration is pretty basic. It's not the &quot;friendliest&quot; hotel room you are going to be staying in.The bathroom was spartan but big. The toiletries were fine and there was plenty of towels. The toilet was in a room across the bath and interestingly there's one door that was the door for the toilet and the living room, which was a bit weird.There's a restaurant downstairs that served up a tasty if limited continental breakfast. The staff very very courteous and friendly."
79,1587,"Jul 8 2007 	Great location and very interesting design	Hotel Godin is a beautiful full service hotel, on the level of perhaps a Westin, but slightly less expensive. The interiors are very interesting, with muted colors and bare concrete. I could have used a bit more light in the guestrooms. But service was great and you certainly can't beat the location right on St. Laurent. Underground parking is available, but PRICEY at 25 CAN a night."
80,1587,"Jul 6 2007	Godin = excellent hotel would stay here again in a heartbeat	Excellent hotel. Pay no mind to the Internet naysayers who say that this was missing or that that was terrible or whatever. This place was excellent, the staff and service was excellent, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended."
81,1587,"Jul 4 2007 	Godin for Jazz Festival	We stayed at the Hotel Godin for the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and chose it for its great location (only 2 blocks from the festival, and a few blocks from Rue St. Denis) and its mod styling. The lobby and lounge area are cool, and you can enjoy free espresso and free wireless internet access. There is also a bar in the lobby that is open until 11pm. The rooms are cool and have a nice minimalist styling, and the ceilings are poured concrete with builder notations scribbled on them (which we thought was cool). The beds are very comfortable, and you will find a free newspaper outside your room each morning. The finish isn't quite up to par with other mod-styled hotels like the W, but it's also a little less expensive. The staff are very friendly. There is a club/ lounge/ bar downstairs, but it didn't seemed to be open during our stay. Also, plan on having breakfast elsewhere, unless you've always wanted to try a $25 omelette (check out La Brioche Lyonnaise on St. Denis for some good local breakfast grub)."
82,1587,"Jun 29 2007 	Nickel and Dime	A very nice, stylish hotel that tries its best to nickel and dime you to death. Granted, this is increasingly common in today's world of travel, but, when you pay $250 a night for a room, you'd think they'd throw in a bottle of water or internet access.Water is $2.50 a small bottle. Although they're free in the workout room, which is nearly always empty. Internet access is $10 a day, something that's not mentioned in any of the hotel literature. There is FREE wireless access in the lobby, but they always keep the techno-music blaring (even at 4 a.m.). A glass of wine in the lobby is $12. Champagne $24.Staff is helpful but typically dense in a young person sort of way. Room pricing is all over the chart depending on where you look. In May, the Hotel Godin website listed rooms at $279. Travelocity had the same room for $225. Expedia had it at $179.All that said, The Godin is conveniently located and nicely run, but you'll come away with the sense that you've been ripped off even though you've probably had a great time."
83,1587,"Jun 25 2007 	Service location style...	The hotel's location is second to none. Close to downtown, the village, Saint Laurent night life, underground city and all major attractions Montreal has to offer. The room was super comfortable, a mixture of old features that made a bold statement (i.e. the ceiling was unfinished, yet the decor of the room was stylish and didn't sacrifice comfort). The bathroom was spacious and super clean. Service is definitely key, we were given directions to everything, and the staff always went above and beyond the call of duty to our every need. Will definitely be back."
84,1587,"May 30 2007 	Loved the Godin	Went to Montreal this past weekend with a girlfriend! we loved the Godin. Room 240 was gorgeous, the bathroom unbelievable! As other reviews mentioned, lighting was a bit of an issue. If you don't mind noise, then the hotel location wont bother you. Street noise is really load. Not the hotels fault just the location. If you want to be in the action, this is perfect. Service was fair, depending on who you get I suppose. i called for a saftey pin, and the girl I spoke to was wonderful! Then I went to Front desk to let them now our A/C wasn't turning on , and she didn't really care at all. Everything in Montreal is extremely laid back anyways. We found service to be slow everywhere we went. Overall I would stay at this hotel again."
85,1587,"May 28 2007 	Poor service poor value go somewhere else for this price	We stayed for a weekend in cold, snowy February. Booked two rooms. The hotel is overpriced for the service levels - we've since been in the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth and it is sooo much better. Go to another hotel - plenty of better choices within the price range, and while the location is good, so are most locations in Montreal - it is a liveable city!1) Valet parking were NOT friendly, access is difficult on busy Sherbrooke if a car or two are already &quot;dropping off&quot; guests - there was quite a mistake with the valets and it ended up on a double billing at the end of the stay. ... that would have been a pardonable mistake but...2) No coffee or cookies in the lobby, despite them being advertised on both the website and the hotel brochures. Cold light-couloured brew was sitting for hours... no amenities of that sort in-room (no coffee maker basics)3) Rooms look and feel rather drab than &quot;chic&quot;, and the dark colours only seem to mask the dirt. However, I agree that the bed/ mattress was firm and linen pleasant.4) Poor sound insulation between walls - we shared the next-door neighbours &quot;sweet valentine&quot; exploits - I must say we got jealous! Unfortunately it didn't help us get sleep...5) The restaurant wasn't open and part of the hotel was &quot;under construction&quot; - yet they still dared to charge full-price...poor.Overall I would not go back to this hotel, it is overpriced and the level of service and overall &quot;feeling&quot; isn't up to snuff for what they charge or for what they presume to be. Plenty of better choices in Montreal."
86,1587,"May 9 2007 	Cool Canadian Chic	The Godin is a very modern spin on a boutique hotel. Lots of glass, chrome and dark colours. If you don't see beauty in different shades of grey then this hotel isn't for you. It is fair to say that the rooms and the lounges could do with more light - suffice to say that the bare concrete ceiling (it was supposed to be like that) in the room didn't have a light fitting in it. Nevertheless, the hotel is well appointed and the decor is tatsteful and eventually grows on you.The lobby has free wireless internet and an expresso machine. If you time it right you get free cakes as well! Staff are friendly and if you speak kindly to the maids they will you extra chocolates when they turn your bed down!Location is good, very close to lots of restaurants and bars on Rue St Laurent. However, the metro stations are a couple of blocks away.Overall, an enjoyable experience in a classy city hotel."
87,1587,"Mar 30 2007	Decent but not the value it used to be.	I've stayed twice at the Hotel Godin, in September 2005 and October 2006. The first stay was amazing. The second stay was decent. The pluses during both stays were the perfect location; the quality of the bed, shower and amenities; and the friendliness and efficiency of the staff. What made the second stay less positive was the decline in value. During the first stay, free bottled water was available in the lobby and the room, a continental breakfast was included in the room rate, and front of the line passes to restaurant/clubs owned by the Godin owners were given out to guests. By the time of the second stay majority ownership had changed and all these were no longer available. So the Hotel Godin is a decent hotel and if you like modern hotels and want to be close to nightlife and good restaurants and a reasonable walk away from the Latin Quarter, Chinatown, and the touristy old town, you'll enjoy a stay there."
88,1587,"Mar 10 2007 	Dark rooms where is the doorman?!	First impression was &quot;where is the doorman or bellman?!?!&quot;. I had lots of luggage and trying to cart it in the slushy side walk by myself. People at the front desk saw that and didn't help! I would understand if they were busy with guests but both were just standing there chatting away. The rooms were very dark. I loved the bathroom except just like the bedroom it was dark, I suggest ladies to apply make up in front of the window! Based on their website I thought they would still have Fresh products. There seemed to be a recent change in amenities to Gilcrhrist &amp; Soames, such a shame... Continental breakfast served downstairs was very good. I almost wanted to ask what bakery bakes their bread! Service was very good too. I loved the location. Close to fantastic restaurants and a couple of trendy stores. I can imagine staying at this hotel in the summer would be fantastic."
89,1587,"Jan 29 2007 	Fantastic	Hotel Godin is great. Good Location, real slick looking lobby, helpful staff, excellent breakfast, and fantastic rooms. There is no other place to stay in Montreal accept this place. Right at the foot of the shops, restraunts, bars, and clubs on St. Laurent and a short walk to St. Catherine. You won't be dissapointed"
90,1587,"Jan 1 2007 	Fantastic location great stay	My girlfriend and I stayed at the Godin over Christmas for 4 days. The hotel was great. Its location on Sherbrooke and St. Laurent was in the center of the great restaurants and bars. The decor was ultra-modern and the prices of in-room services followed that. Room service was ridiculous... $25-$35 entrees. Breakfast for ONE person cost us $25. This could be temporary, since the hotel's restaurant and bar is not yet open.Apart from that, we felt like we were staying in a hotel that was much more expensive than what we actually paid. Hotel + Flight from NYC was $500 each for 4 nights. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Ask for Jean-Pierre at the concierge.. he was extremely helpful and accomodating."
91,1587,"Nov 6 2006 	Loved it!	Hotel Godin was a great stay! Like everyone else has pretty much said, the rooms are a bit dark BUT, the rooms were clean and the furniture was chic and modern. I felt very comfortable staying. Also, the staff was absolutely friendly and helpful! They suggested places for my boyfriend and I to eat. From the manager to the bellboy(especially the bellboy), everyone was absolutely interested in making sure that my boyfriend and I had everything from reservations to directions. I can't rave enough about this place. Maybe my boyfriend and I got really lucky in meeting all the right staff but we really loved the whole staff/room/hotel itself. The location is really great too because its right on the corner of two major streets of Montreal! you are just walking distance of SO many clubs/restaurants/shops!It's a shame that this hotel has so much potential. They couldn't get their liquor license so there is this HUGE space for where the restaurant should be...along with the bar. Because of this, hotel Godin is a hidden GEM! My boyfriend and I will most definitely go back! Thank you to other trip advisors who contribute!"
92,1587,"Oct 30 2006 	Don't bother	What a let down! Hotel Godin is overrated. On the plus side, it is new, well located and clean. However, most of the rooms do not have bath; rooms are dark; when you lay down on the bed and look at the ceiling you would think that you are sleeping in the parking garage (no paint, no ceiling, just ciment!). Good luck if you want to shave or put make up in the washroom...it is so dark....The service was poor. It called itself a boutique-hotel...it is not. Don't bother. Go elsewhere."
93,1587,"Oct 18 2006	Nice Stay	After reading a few reviews on Tripadvisor, I decided to book my reservation. It basically met my expectations. Nothing great, nothing bad either. Here's a breakdown of the pros and cons:Pros:-Location-Price-Service-Amenities: Nice gym, toiletries, etc.-StyleCons:-Dark rooms"
94,1587,"Oct 4 2006 	location location	Situated on the corner of St Laurent and Sherbrooke, there is no better location than the Godin to begin a night on the town. The rooms and lobby are well designed, with the ambiance of a locally owned boutique hotel. The clientele is exactly what you want to see (no cheesy corporate types!). The staff are friendly and helpful. On a lesser note, I am tired of the nickel and diming the better hotels are charging for internet access. It should be free, and at the Godin, it's overpriced. In the past, the staff encouraged me to have breakfast for free, yet on my last trip, after having my breakfast, I was charged, and told that they now charge the guests (it would've been nice to know before eating a banana and a croissant for $14).  Regardless, I much prefer the Godin to the W, as it is a true Montreal establishment that seems to be waiting to flourish, as a major nightclub/hotel phenomenon. I believe it will. And as I said, the location is perfect for enjoying the nightlife."
95,1587,Aug 12 2006 	Great atmosphere - very trendy	I travel alot for work and as I love Montreal I wanted to find a hotel that would be different and Montrealer. I had heard of the Hotel Godin but now after having experienced it I will definitely go back. Everyone was very professional - the service was friendly - I loved the lounge area in the lobby and the european style breakfast. Very modern and clean. Great location as you are able to walk almost anywhere downtown Montreal. Very safe area with lots of trendy restaurants and bars. I will definitely be going back next time I am in the montreal!
96,1587,"Aug 7 2006	Hotel Godin-Best Kept Secret	We had booked a last minute trip to Montreal Aug 5-7, '06. 1/2 business 1/2 pleasure. Having heard of a 100+ room boutique hotel in the downtown area, we thought it was worth a try. What a refreshing experience. From the cool music, chic and smooth lobby, to the well dressed employees, I haven't felt more welcomed in a hotel in years. The room was a little larger than a standard size with dark purples and greys-very different. Black tiles in the bathroom with a glass shower and funky sinks. Every hallway we walked down there was a staff member that smiled.It was within walking distantce-15 minutes to Old Montreal where was a bounty of great restaruants and cafes. Up the street is Sofia's for a great bowl of Goat cheese ravioli and bottle of Vino. A little expensive...but worth it. We went the the hotel restaurant for breakfast which was bright and airy-the server had the sliding doors open to the street. My most pleasant surprise was when we came back to the room both nights and found the room turned down, ice in the buckets, curtains drawn and a treat of chocolates on the pillow. Very welcoming as our feet were sore from walking all day. Didn't find a pool as I dont think they had one. Some planned reno's attachd to the builing are apparently for a banquet hall. I'm glad we went out of our way to try it. Too often we stay at the same chains and are tired of it. Too bad about the taxi's-I've never been for whiplashed so bad coming back from the casino last night. LAstly, go for the espresso in the lobby..."
97,1587,"Jul 26 2006 	Great alternative to the ""beige box""!	If you are looking for an alternative to the &quot;beige box&quot; this is it! Modern and cool yet comfortable with fast, efficient service. Loved the fluffy duvet &amp; pillows, the simple, elegant decor, modern technology and the spa like shower. Would recommend coffee maker in the room as well as more lighting. Great location for shopping &amp; dining."
98,1587,"Jul 6 2006	Way Overrated	Uninformed reviews appear to put the Godin at the head of the pack of Montreal's trendy boutique hotel market. Clearly, those reviewers haven't experienced the Godin firsthand. Service is terrible; the concierge consistently screwed up our dinner reservations, the front desk was alerted about luggage arriving from the airport and we asked them to phone the room when it arrived, but no one ever did.On top of all of that, the Godin's supposed &quot;pluses&quot; were conspicously absent. Cool bar? Nope, not open. Restaurant? Closed. Wireless internet? Not in the rooms, and wired internet access available for a hefty $13 a night. The room keys got demagnetized on a regular basis. Not to mention very dark rooms which, even with all the lights turned on, were still dank and depressing (rather than &quot;trendy&quot;) at night, even during the day.I stayed at the St-Paul just two months prior and for the same price there is no comparison. The St-Paul had a charming staff, which were HELPFUL, not to mention a fully licensed bar and restaurant, beautiful rooms, free internet access, and character missing from the Godin.The Godin had one factor which set it apart from the other boutique hotels in a good way - its location on St-Laurent and Sherbrooke (rather than in the ubiquitous Old Port like every other boutique hotel) made the Plateau, Mile End, Downtown, Old Port and the Village accessible by easy walk. Too bad the hotel is so disappointing!"
99,1587,"Jul 5 2006	We liked it but there are some things you should know	My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Godin from June 30 to July 4. We paid about $215 a night plus $25 a night for parking.LocationIt is definitely better to be in this part of town instead of Old Montreal. Old Montreal is beautiful but it's a place for tourists and does not feel like a real, vibrant city. Godin's neighborhood, Plateau Mont Royal, is half cool and half lame. Unfortunatley Godin is closer to the lame half but is sitll closer to the good half than any hotel i know of. The bad half is Ste Laurent, the street next to the hotel which is often referred to as &quot;trendy&quot; and &quot;cool.&quot; I may be a jaded New Yorker, but i found most of Ste. Laurent to be cheesy and soulless. All the restaurants were playing bad house music and were filled with tacky furniture. But don't be discouraged. The cool half of the Plateau is just a few blocks further to the corner of Duluth and Dorlet streets. This area has beautiful parks and residential architecture. The restaurants were sophisticated, authentic, and had great food. I especially recommend L'Express and Laloux. ServiceEveryone we encountered was friendly and professional. The concierge wasn't around too often but the people at the reception desk were always able to answer our questions. RoomThe room is VERY dark. It's even hard to read unless it's daylight and the shades are up. It was frustrating that there was no translucent curtains that would allow light in but not allow people to see in. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was slick but usable.Food/DrinksThe hotel is not finished yet. There is no sign of construction but large portions of the hotel are empty and unused for no apparent reason. The hotel also doesn't seem to have a liquor license or serve dinner. This wasn't a big factor for us but would be a huge turn-off for someone traveling alone who wanted to meet people in the hotel. The place was a ghost town except during the free breakfast (which was very good)."
100,1587,"Jul 5 2006	Great Room. Depressing Hotel. Bad Shower	My partner and I stayed at the Godin over the July 4th weekend. We decided to come up from New York to check out Montreal. We didn't find the city to our liking (too many depressing buildings and tacky-ness.) The people were blankly nice, but not overwhelming helpful. It seemed as though nobody had any enthusiasm for their own city. This extended to the staff at the Godin. There was no attempt made to help us out in terms of discovering the city. There was no knowledgable concierge on hand to make recommendations. And St. Laurent St.....sad little clubs and gaudy restaurants. not very hip.We bought a bottle of Vodka and holed up on our bed (which is super-comfy) and padded around the nice room. The shower DOES blow though. It's not for tall people and the water pressure is terrible. The room service menu is way overpriced for such a low-rent place. I think it was 24 bucks for a burger.The overall interior design of the hotel is college modern art museum meets new college dorm complex. there is way too much space. no intimacy. aside from a few Ligne Roset lamps in lobby, there is nothing here to shout about. the breakfast room is inversely large in proportion to the selection of food there (no meat, sad little croissants, limited fresh fruit)The exterior of the hotel is pretty joyless as well. Right across from an Esso station. Like an office building. It's not a site to behold and make you think &quot;great....we are at our hotel&quot;.We stumbled through Jazzfest one day. Such a blight. Spilling from St. Catherine to that horrible Place de la Artes. Concrete drabness. Badly dressed people. Soprano Sax....We left the hotel as early as possible and hung out at the airport all day."
101,1587,"Jun 24 2006	Lovin' Godin	Just spent two wonderful nights at the Godin this past week. This is a very cool, comfortable hotel with a location that cannot be beat at the corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent.Best Things:- Super comfortable beds- Large Bathrooms with fogless mirrors- Fresh bath products- Complimentary breakfast in the bar- Cool lobby with mood lighting at nightThings to Improve:- Bar is not open yet but will be soon- No restaurant (maybe next year)The bar and restaurant situation is not a big deal considering some of Montreal's best restaurants and bars are a 2.5 minute walk from the hotel (check out Time Cafe, Madonna did when I was there) The staff was very attentive and helpful, and had lots of suggestions for restaurants and things to do. My room was super quiet with a nice mix of materials: wood, carpet and a concrete ceiling. I can't wait to go back to Montreal and when I do I will be staying at Hotel Godin."
102,1587,"Jun 16 2006 	a Wannabee Hotel	Before I arrived somebody told me it was a wannabee hotel. It was only after my arrival I understood what he meant. This hotel wants to be fancy but it isn't. It wants to be trendy but it isn't. It is build with cheap materials, has no isolation and if you look very carefully it is actually very poor. To make everything worse it is ran by people that apparently have no experience in the hotel business. It misses the class and charm of a good hotel and scores zero when it comes to service. Can you imagine a breakfast room with no coffee spoons around? Can you imagine the sprinkler of the shower mounted to low on the wall so you can not properly shower? can you imagine to wake up by people going to the bathroom in the room above (you think that a complete bathtub is falling on your head)? Can you imagine people from the reception not calling you back after you called them with a specific request? Only looking at the rates you realise why they actually &quot;want to be&quot;. Unfortunately they aren't and the next time I will stay as before at Le Germain. Probably one of the best hotels and not only in Montral..."
103,1587,"Jun 4 2006	The love is gone...	As a travel writer, who has stayed from 5-star hotels to youth hostels, I don't expect too much from my accommodations besides a comfy bed and warm shower. Until, that is, I stayed at Le Godin in Montreal, Canada. Besides the trendy lobby, chic rooms and beautiful staff (which I have seen from New York City to Bombay), there was only one very special feature which really made my stay there unforgettable. Only one thing that spoiled me beyond any other hotel I've stayed at. It was the hotel's star concierge, Anna.As I am always travelling to cities for one or two days at a time, nights spent alone eating room service is common practice. When Anna found out that this was my first trip to Montreal and that I was there on my own, she went out of her way to make a full-day itinerary for me, covering day trips to museums and shopping, to the nightlife of eateries and clubs. She explained, and truthfully, that Montreal was a city to be experienced at all hours. She even made sure to call all the places I was visiting ahead of time to let them know that I was coming and to treat her guest exceptionally well. She even passed by to see me during dinner to make sure that my day had gone well. It had, and very well in fact. As soon as I was back home, I booked another trip back to Montreal in 2 months time.Well, was I shocked to learn that upon arrival in Montreal, Anna was no longer working at Le Godin. What's more, her entire position had been eliminated. A concierge was deemed as &quot;not necessary&quot; at this chic hotel, where clients expect a high level of service (as confessed by one of the remaining staff). Long gone is the specialized attenton to each customer. Long gone is the much-needed advice and suggestions offered on the beautiful city of Montreal. Long gone are the kind words and pleasant smiles of Anna. It is safe to say that my second trip to Montreal fell far short of my first visit. This second encounter has not soured my taste for Montreal, but the same can't be true for Le Godin. Without Anna, this boutique hotel falls short on all points, especially customer service. The new management, which swept in and eliminated Anna and her position, has buried itself in quick sand. As a travel writer, whose job it is to make recommendations on where to stay in international cities, I am stating to you, as I did to my colleagues, family and friends, save yourself the trouble of bad service and foolish management and don't stay at Le Godin. The Comfort Inn would be a better bet, in my opinion. My mission, since the day I found out that Anna was no longer at this hotel, is to find her and take all my business to her new employer. Stay tuned for my next entry... I'll let you know where this jewel of a concierge is hiding."
104,1587,"May 31 2006 	Cool but things you should know.....no booze!	The Godin is designed as a cool, boutique style (read dark wood, polished concrete and fresh white linen) hotel, and it works on that level. The reception area is airy and welcoming, but we had read about the famous 'in room check in' and there was no sign of it despite the hotel not being too busy. The rooms are spacious with really comfortable beds, but no tea or coffee facilities and the wireless access didn't work in my room.Breakfast is pretty good - toast, cheese, fruit, fresh bread and pastries - but the bran muffins weren't at all tasy and they frequently ran out of coffee, juice and eggs through not topping up often enough. There's a funky looking bar and sound system, and a terrace where you can take breakfast.Now for the downside - they 'forgot' to collect my dry cleaning before the 9am deadline (despite my calling down) and as a result I had to chase to get my still dirty clothes returned before checking out the next day. No acceptable apology from housekeeping, although the guy who returned them was clearly embarrassed. My Canadian clients had arranged for a gift to be in our room on arrival, and it wasn't delivered to the room until 11.30pm at night. Having just got off a UK flight, it wasn't fun to be woken up by unsolicted room service! Finally - and importantly - they have no alcohol license! No-one in the hotel mentions it, either when booking or when you're there, but there's only a soft drink mini bar and no way of purchasing wine, beer, anything. My Canadian clients informed me that the owners couldn't get a license, and that it was a bit of a standing joke accross the city that this cooler than cool hotel was dry!All in it's a nice hotel, but service isn't quite right yet and they should really be telling people about the bar absence. You've been warned.....!"
105,1587,"May 26 2006 	Very dark and gloomy	I was bumped to the Hotel Godin for a conference I was attending at the Congress Center. It is not really close to the Palais de Congrais/Congress Center. I think you need to be a person who likes this type of hotel to enjoy it. Good points: The beds are VERY comfortable thought. The staff is nice as well.Bad points: The walls in the bedroom are dark grey to light black. Everything in the hotel is various shades of grey. I found it depressing and hard to see in the room at night. No coffee maker, no iron, no lobby store if you forget something. I dont think Id stay there again as it was to dark for my liking."
106,1587,"May 21 2006	Charming classy	It's not often we find boutique hotels that are cool without being cold, but Hotel Godin is it. We stayed in the basic room with kng size bed, which was spacious, airy, superbly designed, and wonderfuly comfortable. The included continental breakfast was great, and the espresso machine in the lobby with complimentary pound cake was a welcome sight after a long trip The staff were all utterly gracious, competent, and helpful. Add to this the perfect location, and we'll definitely be back over and over and over again."
107,1587,"Apr 29 2006	Nice Hotel	Clean very modern room. Very nice and recommended. Not a big business hotel, small with character."
108,1587,"Mar 27 2006	Fabulous.	I simply loved this hotel. It was chic, simple, stylish and perfect for a weekend getaway with the girls. I came with my best friend the other weekend and adored the room, the service (the concierge is the best thing that ever happened to us!) and the overall ambience. We partied all night at the Globe Restaurant down the street and had a great time. The next morning, the breakfast was the perfect hangover cure. It was the best I've seen at a hotel so far.For two girls who work in fashion publishing from New York, this hotel was a perfect answer for a few fabulous nights of partying in Montreal. I would think it to be Montreal's SoHo Grand or maybe the Mercer...its in a really trendy area that seemed to be close to everything that was worth seeing."
109,1587,"Mar 1 2006 	Elegant Boutique Hotel!	Our room was exceedingly stylish. Attention to details such as creative lighting, a very comfortable bed, dark warm colours for winter mixed with large mirrors and windows for light, all contributed a very balanced and comfortable -not to mention aesthetically pleasing- interior. We wish the bathroom had a bathtub and not just a (albeit beautiful) shower: it's cold in Montreal and we would have liked to immerse ourselves to thaw. We got a good deal on the hotel room online and so price versus quality was really quite astounding at the Godin: that is one reason we rate this hotel excellent and not simply above average. The service at the hotel was discreet (in a European invisible hand way) and very helpful when we asked for advice on Montreal life and where to go out. The location is excellent. We especially enjoyed two nearby restaurants: Au Pied de Cochon and L'Express. It's worth mentioning that the Godin feels a little unfinished -partly because their bar has not yet opened: it is a beautiful space. I hope it's open next time we're in Montreal -we'll be staying at the Godin."
110,1587,"Feb 21 2006	Great boutique hotel though not perfect	Wanted to stay at a boutique hotel in Montreal with my significant other - lots of choice of course, but wanted good value as well. Found Hotel Godin at $140/night for Friday and Saturday night which seemed like a steal and read great things about the history and design of the hotel and rooms.The positives:- Good amenities in the room: nice bathrobes, modern flat screen TV (24&quot;)- Decor was very modern / trendy with deep colors, but still comfortable- Privilege (standard) room was large enough and comfortableThe negatives:- Service was hit-or-miss. Half the time there was no bellman at the door and we had to wait / look for him. Also the staff did not respond to a request for additional towels and glasses, claiming that &quot;the hotel was quite busy&quot;. All in all, staff could have been friendlier, but service was not terrible- Lighting in the rooms is not great, as others have mentionedOverall, we were quite happy with the stay. It is a hotel with quite a lot of style. In fact, I would say that the rooms have a similar style to those at a W Hotel."
111,1587,"Nov 30 2005	Country Gal Loses Her Heart to Montreal	As a first-time tourist to Montreal, all I can say is thank you to Hotel Godin for making my stay so absolutely fabulous. When I had first thought about vacationing in Montreal, I was planning on staying at one of the bigger hotel chains, such as the Holiday Inn or the Sheraton. But then I saw an advertisement of Hotel Godin in a magazine, and decided to go for a more intimate experience. I am so happy I did so! The rooms are stylish, the location to restaurants and nightlife is phenomenal... But the most impressive part of my experience was the staff. After speaking with the concierge and the front-desk staff, I abandoned my pre-arranged schedule of must-see tourist sites, and listened to their suggestions instead. They were able to tell me about events and places to visit that I never would have found on my own. Friendly, knowledgeable and generous, everyone at Hotel Godin went above and beyond in providing me with the best service. I will definitely come back to Montreal in the future, and the only hotel I would ever consider staying at is the Hotel Godin."
112,1587,"Nov 21 2005	Has potential	This hotel is very beautiful and has a lot of potential, but........ The doorman &quot;forgot&quot; to bring our luggage to our room after we checked in, whenever we wanted a tea or coffee from the lounge there were no clean mugs or water (and there were certainly no nibblies either), our internet connection and the pay movie channels were not set up for us leading to 30 minute wait, lightbulbs were burnt out in one of the lamps, the mini-bar was broken and wouldn't open, no wine glasses, corkscrew, iron, or ironing board in room, hard time getting a hold of reception or valet service, and a few times the doorman just stood near the door looking at us (without opening the door)as we were entering the hotel leading to an awkward entrance LOL. It got to the point where we were never surpised when something went wrong. Seems like they took staff from their restaurants to run the hotel.That said, the room and bathroom, although dark, were very clean and nice, the breakfast was great, we loved the &quot;Fresh&quot; toilletries, the location is excellent, and the gym is nice touch. I realize that the things I am complaining about are very menial (I'm by no means a princess), but you expect a certain amount of service and attention to detail when you are staying at a hotel such as this. I would not stay there again only because I have stayed at what is considered their competition (many of them) and had better service.........and I could see myself in their bathroom mirrors!)."
113,1587,Nov 4 2005	beautiful hotel	this is an excellent hotel. striking design. comfotable rooms. central to both the Latin Quarter and Downtown.they do not have a liquor license yet which they are up front about. some articles have errounesoubly mentioned the drinks they serve.
114,1587,"Nov 4 2005	Great Hotel	My husband and I stayed at Hotel Godin for four nights. We had searched on Trip Advisor before booking and were pleased that we chose this hotel.Our first impressions were very good - friendly receptionist - helpful porter - great location.Our room was very spacious, comfortable and clean and the bathroom was amazing with a large walk in shower and plenty of fluffy towels. We had one disappointment when after two peaceful evenings the neighbouring room was occupied by a couple of very noisy women - waking us up in the early hours on their return from clubbing! We did complain to reception and they moved us to another room.Breakfast was excellent with a varied choice of cereal, fruit, bread, pastries, tea, coffee and fruit juice. An endless supply of bottled water was available and if you are able to return to the hotel late afternoon, small nibbles are supplied with tea and coffee in the reception.We found the staff to be polite and helpful and would stay here on a return trip to the City. It is in an excellent location for exploring the city and the old town is only a short walk away."
115,1587,"Oct 10 2005	Fun if you're not looking for hominess!	We stayed for a night and knew we were expecting contemporary. It's pretty stark and dark in the rooms but comfortable. The bathroom was very cool with purple glass tiles and black shower. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was yummy with french pastry, fruit and cheese. The only thing I wasn't keen on was how dark things were. The lighting to the lower level bathrooms was so dark you had to run your hand on the walls so you knew where you were going. Otherwise the visit was fun."
116,1587,"Sep 27 2005	The right hotel in the right location	Three friends and I stayed at Hotel Godin for three nights. I would echo the broad theme laid out by all the other reviewers: superb location, attentive/professional service, great rooms, no restaurant/bar yet, stylish, access to trendy bar/lounge/restaurant clubs. Location: the corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent turns out to be really a very central location. It is 1 - 15 minutes away from the Latin Quarter, the Village, Chinatown. While we walked to the Old Port area -- most people will probably want to take the Metro or taxi. However, the Old Port area was incredibly touristy -- the equivalent of Times Square in New York City. Sherbrooke and St. Laurent was the equivalent of Tribeca/Soho in New York City. Lots of interesting restaurants, micro-breweries, lounges, clubs and bars -- mostly attended by locals of various ages and interests. We were 5 minutes walk to Schwartz Deli -- which is Montreal's very effective response to New York's Katz's Deli. Hotel service: The four of us came from all over the U.S. at various time. The hotel staff was very careful to remember our preferences, arrival times and helped us coordinate. After we had already &quot;used&quot; our rooms (towels, etc.), we had decided to get two adjoining rooms -- the hotel staff looked into it and immediately accomodated us. While I usually find it extremely creepy staying at hotels where the staff is better looking and better dressed/groomed than the guests, Hotel Godin was the rare exception where everyone was really friendly. Great rooms: Stylish rooms with great bathrooms. The beds were extremely comfortable. LCD tv. Endless flow of free bottled water. Only complaint I would have was the rooms were a little dark and there was no bath tub. As others have mentioned, there was extremely nice space for a bar and restaurant, but they were not opened. I really hope they get to open them soon.Access to restaurants: Montreal has a few restaurants that turn into dance clubs as the night progresses -- a very neat and fun concept. As we were going to various bars, the bartenders mentioned a couple of places to us: Gogo Lounge (not a strip club!), Myst, Cafe Buona Notte, Globe, Time Supper Club. We went to three of these. It turned out Buona Notte, Globe and Time Supper Club were all owned by Godin. There were huge lines of very beautiful people everywhere, but to my huge surprise (being a cynical New Yorker) the doormen escorted us in at the very front right away at every place when we mentioned we were from Godin.Overall, great experience at Godin (and Montreal). We got a phenomenal price through Expedia ($165/night) but I would be willing to pay a lot more when I come back to Montreal again during Jazz fest. I only hope we can get a room then."
117,1587,"Sep 22 2005	Great location hip rooms 	A fun hotel with friendly staff in a hip area. It would be nice if there was a bar - but the extensive complimentary breakfast made up for it! The gym is small, but really all you need for vacation."
118,1587,Sep 20 2005	Very beautiful!	Wonderful hotel with modern decoration. A bit expensive but worth it.
119,1587,"Sep 18 2005	Wonderful hotel in the best location in Montreal!	I've never written one of these reviews before, but after my stay at the Hotel Godin, I felt compelled to. My husband and I just spent two nights there. We usually stay in the Loews Vogue, and have stayed in the Residence Inn downtown. The location of this hotel and the quality of service both make it better than the others. Hotel: At the Vogue, I've encountered plenty of snobbiness (maybe because my husband and I are young; I don't know). At the Hotel Godin, everyone was incredibly friendly from the moment I checked in until the moment I checked out. The Privilege King is a great room; ask for a room with a tub--it's very deep and plenty of room for two. The King bed is so comfortable; the pillows are incredibly soft. There is not a lot of counter space in the bathroom (none really--you have to improvise with the little stand next to the sink). The toilet is in a separate small room from the Shower and tub, which is a good idea. Even though I think the hotel was fairly crowded, it felt like we were the only ones in the entire hotel. It was quiet (except I could hear very late-night revelers outside my 4th floor window, but I didn't care). My laptop didn't pick up a wireless signal, but we purchased it through the TV for 9.95 for 24 hours. Neither the bar nor the restaurant is currently open (as of 9/18). The free breakfast is nice--fruits, cereals, breads, assorted cheeses, croissants, etc. Parking is 24 (CAD). Location: half a block from Rue St. Laurent, with plenty of non-tourist trap restaurants (unlike those restaurants surrounding the area of Loews and the Residence Inn). Maestro SVP was a great seafood bistro; we also ate at Pizzedelic. You hear French a lot more in this area of Montreal, but everyone we encountered spoke English as well. I just arrived home, and I'm already looking into staying there in November. My husband and I had a fantastic time there. I've never encountered a nicer staff. Not even a hint of snobbery. Tip: book thru expedia, as it seems they have the best rates (a lot cheaper than my quotes from orbitz or the hotel). You will not regret staying here!"
120,1587,"Sep 17 2005	Great Location - keep reading	Lets get this straight  Overall, the hotel is lovely and modern - like a photo spread from Wallpaper. (If you dont know what Wallpaper is, you probably will not appreciate the dcor and should take particular note of the following paragraphs).The moment I walked in to the hotel, I appreciated what the owners were trying to do and I was very comfortable. However, the hotel holds itself out as being in a very select league and when you play in the big leagues.well, you know.From reading the hotel website, I had a certain picture in my mind  that expectation was not met. I was hoping for a boutique modern Schrager-esque hotel run like a Swiss watch  that did not happen.The Hotel Godin in a brief description: A modern Schrager-esque hotel run like my grandpas railroad watchWhile the spits and putters of the hotel (and my mixed metaphors) did not destroy the experience - I would say that this wine is being served before its time and the hotel needs to breathe a little before I come back.A few issues:Under-staffedUnder-soundproofed for street noiseNo bar. No liquor license.No restaurant.Don't let the website fool you - just Google &quot;liquor license and Hotel Godin&quot; and you will see that after putting $30 million in renovations, the owners of the hotel have not been permitted to obtain a liquor license - because their other properties have a history of liquor-law violations.So while you can go to the W and lounge and party in the lobby bar and eat in the hotel's restaurant - at the Godin you are stuck with empty space.For some people that would be fine - they like peace and quiet....But please note where this Hotel is located. The corner of Sherbrooke and St. Laurent is ground-zero for nightlife (think Rush and Division in Chicago) and if you did not know that before you stayed in the hotel - you will know the first night when the horn honking and drunken revelry sings through your windows.The positive side of location, location, location is that you can walk to an assortment of cafes, coffee houses, restaurants, bars and wander back home to the Hotel Godin with no fear of getting lost - you are truly in the middle of the action.The downside of the lively street life is that when the lights go out and before the Xanax kicks in, if you close your eyes really hard, it still sounds like you have camped-out in the hotels backyard (or you left the windows open).I am not sure if I slept for more than one uninterrupted hour at a time due to the noise.The next problem.. strike that: the next issue....the staff. Let me clarify: The staff is wonderful!! Nice, suave, polite, etc... The problem is the &quot;understaff&quot; - you see because the hotel is not fully up-and-running - the hotel is severely understaffed.As frequent Montreal travelers know - there is a flat fee from the airport for transport to the city. About $30 for a taxi and $50 for a limo (Town Car). The limo driver got lost because for some reason no taxi driver or limo driver knows about the hotel - the point is: We were dropped off on the side of the hotel and stood outside for 10 minutes waiting for someone to help us with the bags - there was no one &quot;on duty&quot;. We schlepped all of the bags inside to reception and had to lug our bags to our room. The nice reception lady (girl) was about 5' tall and weighed 100 lbs wet  Do you think I was going to ask her to carry the bags?? Even if she had offered - which she didn't - I was not going to play the colonial governor, so I lugged all of the bags myself.Later in the stay, doormen sporadically appeared, a wonderful concierge appeared and overall the experience was wonderful....Wonderful but &quot;one-off&quot; - and until they get their act completely together I am going back to the W. With all that aside however, the hotel is really ABOVE-average, but it is not excellent.... and I am afraid that with this price-point only the excellent survive."

1,1589,Oct 27 2009 	Very nice stay	This hotel is a 2-3 minute walk from the Place des Arts station. Downtown is a 15 minute walk or 5 minute metro ride. Old Montreal/Chinatown is also a 15 minute walk away. I arrived at this hotel around 12:30 PM and was promptly given a room on the top floor. Staff were always friendly and helpful with any questions I had. No free breakfast but lots of places to eat around hotel including a Cora's across the street. Also a Provigo is across the street so very convenient however there was no fridge or microwave in my room. No free pc to use but there is free wireless internet access. The charge for the pc was I think $3 for 20 minutes. You can go across the street to the 24 hour internet cafe which charged $4 for 1 hour. One thing to be aware of is a new building is supposed to go up next door but construction hadn't started yet when I stayed there.
2,1589,"Oct 12 2009 	Good value great location	My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and had a great stay overall. The hotel is in a great location downtown Montreal, close to several great restaurants, shopping, bars, and parks. Even though we were right downtown, we found the hotel nice and quiet. The staff were very nice and helpful directing us around the city. The rooms are nothing special but have everything you need if you are mainly just going to be using your room for sleeping and as a base point."
3,1589,"Aug 12 2009 	Great hotel excellent location	We have now stayed at this hotel 3 times over the past 3 years and we find it very convenient in location to both downtown and McGill university. We have always had clean rooms and courteous staff. The air conditioning always worked, we always had internet accessible and it met all of our expectations. We found it easy to walk downtown or take the subway which is only a block away. The university is easily accessed. The restaurant leaves something to be desired, but just a 10 minute walk leads you to some of the best restaurants in Montreal."
4,1589,"Jul 25 2009 	Nice place to stay	We were there five nights, Saturday through Wednesday. The room had a refrigerator, adequate clothes storage, a sofa, and free wireless Internet service. The staff was quite helpful and courteous, and did everything they could to help us; we needed their assistance numerous times.Our room was clean, comfortable, and always well-made-up every day. We had a corner room, with an extra hallway, which ensured it was quiet, even when the hallway was noisy (there was a boisterous group of athletes in the hotel the first couple of nights).We especially liked the location, with a drugstore and grocery store, as well as several other useful businesses across the street, a two-block walk to the Metro, and a major bus line. It's a short walk to Rue Sherbrooke, Rue St.-Laurent, Rue St.-Denis, and Rue Ste.-Catherine.The only dislikes were relatively minor for us: the room keys usually didn't work on the first try; the television didn't show closed captioning; and the wireless internet was slow when a number of guests were using it.If we ever return to Montreal, we will strongly consider coming back to the Downtown Quality Hotel."
5,1589,"Jul 20 2009 	No attention to detail No Parking Bums sit outside and beg	Just returned from a visit to Montreal and (unfortunately) stayed at this hotel. We had stayed here a few years ago because I had &quot;free&quot; nights, but was unhappy then due to the hard beds and lack of parking (despite the advertising!)...anyway, decided to give them another chance due to the &quot;Sweet Deals&quot; promotion by Montreal-Tourisme - stay 2 nights, get the third free, continental breakfast, and other gifts and promotions for the Laugh Festival, held nearby. Once again, there was no on-site parking available - had to park down the street at a non-secure outdoor lot where the local bums congregated at night. Was informed that there was NO continental breakfast offered - later corrected and given vouchers for a continental breakfast at Cora's(choice of a bagel, cold cereal, or oatmeal) , across the street; however no gifts or promotions for booking as promised (and no effort to rectify after showing the ad to a manager!); a pair of panties left hanging on the bathroom door from a previous guest; dirty bed linens, and an air conditioner that didn't work (but was fixed). The small room refrigerator needed to be defrosted, but worked OK for the items purchased at the Provigo supermarket located across the street (where they charge you 5 cents per bag!) Late night returning would find one or two of the local bums sitting on the bench outside the hotel, (as well as throughout the general neighborhood) asking for handouts! The general location is OK for tourists, near a Metro station, and you can walk (a long walk!) to the Old Port and to the nightime activities on Crescent St. However, for the price charged ($191CAD) for the king-suite (a rather small room) there are other, superior choices in Montreal, with this hotel to be bypased by me in the future, no matter how many &quot;free&quot; nights I can get!"
6,1589,"Apr 13 2009 	Surprisingly Pleasant	Four of us were in Montreal for one night. We needed two rooms, each with two beds as we wanted the comfort and privacy of not sharing beds. The hotel had to be close to McGill and we were on a budget. This hotel met all our needs. I was unsure of what to expect because it is a smaller hotel. It was wonderful. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, comfortable and elegant. It was like staying at larger, luxury hotels, except the rooms were a bit smaller, though still a good size. The hotel was well maintained, the beds were comfortable, the furnishing and linen fresh. No run down feel here. We'll book here next time in Montreal whether we're on a budget or not."
7,1589,"Feb 12 2009	Nice hotel	It is a very nice hotel in a great location. We were with a group and all rooms were nice and updated. One room the t/v didn't work and we phoned down and they said it would be fixed, but it never was. It didn't matter much because we were only there for 1 night. Overall great hotel in nice area."
8,1589,"Oct 23 2008 	Great deal great location	I was skeptical about this hotel before arriving from some of the bad online reviews - but even the much more expensive hotels in the city also have some bad reviews!The room (1 queen, pull out small sofabed) was a little small, but not cramped. Bed was hard, and pillows marshmallowy, but not bad.TV was very small in a cabinet that also was the clothes chest and &quot;closet&quot;. The door concealing the TV would swing closed when you walked by it - minor annoyance.The bathroom was clean and modern with decent water pressure in the shower.Elevators were always fast and desk clerks pleasant.Great location - half a block from Sherbrooke Ave where all the higher priced hotels are. 2 blocks from the Metro entrance. Half a block from a 24 hour Second Cup coffee shop. 4 blocks from McGill.$15 a night for secure parking is a good deal - most hotels are charging $25 and many of the stand-alone lots are not secure."
9,1589,"Oct 17 2008 	Great hotel convenient access to the rest of Montreal	Let me start by saying my wife and I had three free nights coming to me, so the rooms were free - I only had to pay for parking. While the hotel parking was $15/night, I saw other parking lots throughout the city charging the same 24-hour rate, so I wasn't too disappointed. I've stayed in other cities of this size or larger that charge much more per night.I really can't say anything bad about the hotel. The lobby wasn't huge or glamorous, but I'm not spending any time there. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and at my request even provided me with some hints about what to see, where to go and even a few key French phrases. Everything was very clean as well.The room was simple but clean and met our needs. The pillows could have been a little more firm. The heat worked fine when needed. The TV was fine. Ice machine on our floor.The big perk this hotel offers is convenient access to the Metro (5-minute walk) and numerous eateries and convenient stores in the area. I found the grocery store across the street convenient but a bit expensive. I found another grocery store on St. Laurent (10-minute walk) that was less expensive. I'd have no problems recommending this hotel or staying here again."
10,1589,"Sep 25 2008	Not Bad Not Great	I stayed at the Quality Hotel September 20-22.The best part about this hotel is the location; you're right in the heart of downtown Montreal, only a few blocks' walk from a variety of shops, restaurants, bars and night clubs.The downsides? Some of the rooms are very outdated (friends of ours had better luck in other rooms). For example, our room had a very old TV that had the alarm clock built-in! The mini-bar is $10 per day, and our fridge was really old. The bedding also left a little to be desired - very firm mattress, average sheets/pillows, and a comforter that had the color and texture of a burlap sack.The front desk attendants also warned us to watch our luggage, bags, etc. everywhere we went in the hotel outside of our room. They said that unattended bags are always getting stolen, especially from the lobby. However, I'm sure this isn't unique to this particular hotel; it probably happens anywhere in downtown hotels.All in all, if you're looking for a decently-priced hotel with basic amenities but access to all that downtown Montreal has to offer, this is the hotel for you. If you want a hotel experience that's anything above ordinary, I suggest you look elsewhere."
11,1589,"Sep 2 2008 	Pleasantly Surprised	We were pleasantly surprised. Great location, clean room, except for funky smell when we first came in, but I believe it was attributed to the maid just cleaning our room before we got there and cleaning tools may have been the culprit becasue the smell eventually dissapeared (like wet mop or used wet towel smell).It was just confined to the bathroom, and like i said, went away after a while, so we didn't complain. If you're simple people, or have a family, this is the place to be. I'll summarize and keep it short with my pro's and cons below:Pros: 1) location, location, location! short walk to subway, st. catherine street, st. laurent st, mont royal parc, old montreal, etc - perfect location! (across the street from a supermarket and tons of restaurants nearby) and close to subway too!2) friendly and informative staff 3) Parking, high $15 fee, but worth it with the in and out privelages 4) Clean and overall inviting feeling of hotel.Cons: 1) parking lot got full, and if you left, you might not get your spot back. But we left the car parked anyway, so it didn't bother us. 2) Funky &quot;wet smell&quot; in bathroom that eventually went away. Overall, a great value and cool place if you're looking to save doe on hotels, and use that saved doe for the night clubs or retaurants!"
12,1589,"Aug 8 2008 	Decent hotel bad experience	We stayed at the hotel one weekend in July. It's in a good location, walking distance from Vieux Montreal and Rue Sainte-Catherine. The room size was good and clean.Unfortunately, they decided to paint our floor without telling us beforehand. We get off the elevator on our floor, to find a worker spray painting the hall. He freaked out and shoved us off the floor. We couldn't get into our room, and had inhaled toxic fumes!The front lobby told us that they left a message at our room, about changing rooms. We checked - it was left close to 11:30 am the same day! The hotel staff had to get all of our stuff. It was not a good scene.We had to wait until the general manager was in Monday - we were going to be credited for one night's stay. But it took me several emails and phone calls over 2 weeks to finally get my credit card deducted.It's too bad because the hotel was fine otherwise. But the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth."
13,1589,"Jun 11 2008 	Worst Hotel I have ever stayed in	We staying at this hotel during Grand Prix weekend 3 adults and 1 infant. For over $1500 for 3 nights we were incredibly disappointed. The only thing that was good about this place is that they let us check in at 11 am because of the baby. After that it was all downhill. We were told the hotel had Wi-Fi access, and it did not, when we went to get a cable it did not work. We called down to the front desk and they informed us that the 8th floor did not have internet!On the second day (Saturday) we left the hotel at 9 am to head to the race track. When we arrived back at the hotel at 3 pm we found our door left open! On top of that our room was not made. Nor did any one come to make it. We called down to make a complaint and they told us that someone would be up to check our door lock. They told us that the results were inconclusive and that it must have been us who left the door open. Sunday We left at 9am again I arrived back at 2:30 with the baby, again the room was not made. When the maid came by I was feeding the baby on the couch and all she did was put a dirty towel back up on the rack. Throw some towels in the washroom and change a garbage, plus she left the door open again! Which I did not notice until my brother came back because I was on the couch the whole time and could not see the door! When my brother called to the front desk they said there was nothing they could do and that he would have to wait to see the manager the next morning. Every time we asked for something they told us they didn't have it. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and the food was absolutely horrific. However our waitress was very very kind and gave great service. We want a refund for our stay because they have a 100% Satisfaction guarantee that if there is a problem that is not solved they will issue a refund. When we mentioned this, they said nothing. Overall it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had I will never be back to this hotel!"
14,1589,"May 19 2008 	Okay experience; receptionist unfriendly	Stayed at the hotel for a few days, it is a good location, pretty close to Downtown Montreal. The rooms are okay but smaller than other hotels. Room was well furnished, exterior of the building was okay as well. Garage was a bit dirty.Upon checkout, the receptionist was not very friendly, and probably dealt with us differently than she should have because -we were non-French. When we left, she muttered something in French that was possibly an insult. I would not want to visit this hotel again if it is the same receptionist. When we first walked in, our first impression of the hotel was that it was very small, and it actually is. there's hardly a concierge area, and hardly even a lounge. A restaurant shares the first floor with the hotel, and there are no amenities.Overall I would say it was an average stay for us at this hotel, wasn't that great but okay for us to live in the hotel."
15,1589,Mar 13 2008 	Hotel Stay	We were two adults and two teenagers that arrived at the Hotel on a sunday and planned to stay till tuesday but changed our mind after one night. Ask for the connection to internet and was told that they didn't have any left. Television picture was very snowy and every time you shut it off....it had to be unblocked by the front staff. We ask questions about the area and the clerk couldn't answer us. Parking at 15.00 a night is a bit expensive. The restaurant attached to the hotel is great and the service was exceptional with good food.
16,1589,"Feb 12 2008	Great place!	I visited this place as a solo traveller as I got a great rate from Expedia. For its location and price, you can't go wrong. The room was comfortable and very clean, although the room could have been a little warmer, given it was the depth of winter.Lovely, friendly staff and a supermarket across the street, made this an enjoyable stay."
17,1589,"Jan 23 2008 	great experience would do it all over again	We are from Victoria BC and visited Montreal for the first time in January 2008, my son, myself and 2 friends. We were there for the habs game and everything was perfect. Front counter staff was very helpful and everything you need is very close to the hotel. Being first time visitors to Montreal, we were glad we could experience the night life without taxing all over the place. Beautiful view of the city line aswell. Also very close to Bell Centre. Paid corporated rate so it wasn't too expensive, two double beds and a couch. Would we go again, YES and stay at the same place. Thanks for a great time. go habs go!!!"
18,1589,"Oct 17 2007 	Perfectly Acceptable!!	I got a very good rate on Hotwire for a five night stay over the long Coumbus Day/Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel is located on a decent street near McGill. Walking distance to most everything and very close to a Metro for everything else. Very nice supermarket right across the street. You really cannot beat the convenience or the price for a basic, clean hotel experience.Room was clean and well maintained. Nicely organized, although no closet at all. Free ethernet Internet service. My only issues were with lack of follow-up at the Front Desk when my lost luggage arrived and a lack of organization or logic with housekeeping that kept my room from being made up for my first three days at the hotel. The latter was somewhat caused by my schedule but the housekeeper did not follow up and clean my room when I was actually away from the hotel as I had asked. It was this general lack of communication among hotel staff members that caused the only disappointments during my stay."
19,1589,"Oct 10 2007 	Standard Safe Clean and Good Location	This is an average standard chains hotel, very clean, safe and located in down town. The ladies in the receptionist desk were polite and helpfull. Nothing to brag about this one, a bit pricey for what it is...."
20,1589,"Sep 29 2007 	Nice hotel	The room was clean, the bed was good, the tv was 29&quot; flat, well located, staff sometimes gently but sometimes not. There is a subway station near and a market in front of the hotel. We stood there for 4 days. we had a little problem with the door lock - it didn't open but it was solved quickly."
21,1589,"Sep 4 2007 	Pricey for its class	This hotel is located on the outskirts of hotel row off sherbrooke boulevardPROS: Location is across street from supermarket  walking to Old Montreal is about 20 minutes  Metro stop is about 5 min. walk  good continental breakfast if your package includes  parking in facilities(extra cost)  4 pillows per bed was helpfulCONS: Very pricey for quality of hotel  beds were uncomfortable  furniture is from the 1980s  room had musky odor (when told of problem, the fix was to spray the room with a scent)  Carpets were worn and quite dirty  AC didn't work so well  only 2 people operated front desk when we were there (we were a bit concerned since upon arrival, two homeless persons were sitting in front of the hotel staring at us)"
22,1589,Jul 5 2007 	Good location - high price	I inquired about the price and the man at the front desk quoted me a price. I asked if there was parking. He said 'no' but recommended a lot. I left to check the parking. When I came back the price had gone up. The hotel was OK otherwise. The location is good.Park on the street if you have a car. The parking instructions are in french. Have somebody translate what the parking rules are. Everybody speaks english.
23,1589,"Jun 9 2007 	Fantastic Value in the heart of the action!	Boyfriend and I stayed in the hotel on our way through to Atlantic Canada. Clean, comfortable rooms at a great price. Wonderful location in the heart of downtown Montreal."
24,1589,"Apr 24 2007	Great hotel	We had a wonderful experience at this hotel. We were somewhat uncertain, having read the other reviews on the site. We arrived early and were immediately shown to our room. The people at the desk could not have been friendlier or more helpful throughout our stay. The room was clean and, along with the bathroom was a nice size. The location is ideal; there is a 24/7 restaurant in the lobby, a grocery store across the street, a small mall up the street, it is near the downtown shopping, and there is a lovely pedestrian area filled with restaurants (avenue Prince Arthur) in a short walking distance. We would definitely stay here again."
25,1589,"Apr 15 2007 	Great Location! Great Staff!	I felt that this hotel was wonderful!As two couples of 24 year olds, all first timers to Montreal, we we're not too sure what to expect. After fist finding our way to another Quality Inn and being scared for our lives by the outside view, we were happy to realize that we were at the wrong Quality. After finding our way to the hotel, everything from there on was perfect. As Choice Privilege members, we did inquire about our complimentary upgrade. They had upgraded rooms available but we would not be able to have close rooms. An employee escorted us to view the rooms to decide if we wanted to upgrade and be apart, or keep the original rooms and be connecting. The upgrade rooms were a tiny bit larger, but did not offer much else except a mini fridge, so we chose to stay in our lower grade rooms. The hotel is RIGHT across the street from a grocery store that is open late, where you can purchase some alcohol, snacks, breakfast foods, etc, if you want to save on some money. We did dine in the adjoining restaurant in the hotel. The food was good, but the waitress appeared fairly absent minded.. forgetting plenty of our requests. Our room also had floor to ceiling windows that overlooked the street which was nice to watch the hustle and bustle (and people watch the shoppers in the grocery store).The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main streets for shopping, and there are a multitude of restaurants once you step outside.There is a daily fee for secured parking in the underground parking lot.The front desk staff were very helpful, from the moment we inquired about viewing both room types before deciding whether to upgrade, right up until we checked out.One of the girls at the front desk (I really wish I could remember her name) was great. As we didn't know much about Montreal, we wanted to experience a bit of the nightlife but weren't sure were to head. She let us know what clubs would be busy on what evenings, and even called a friend of hers that was dj'ing at one of the clubs to get us placed on the guestlist and some complimentary drinks.On our last evening, after a heavy night of drinking we did not end up checking out to nearly 1:30 p.m, and no one called our room to kick us out! :)Unfortunately, I cannot say if the price was worth our stay as we had a Quality Inn Employee discount (which means we had a very cheap rate), but I am pretty confident that it would be worth the full price (even if the hotel was terrible, I would pay it for the location only!)The next time I return to Montreal, I will definitely be staying at this hotel!"
26,1589,Jan 3 2007	terrible experience don't go there	I had a terrible experience there. These people promise you one thing but do something else. They simply lie. Do yourself a favour and avoid this place.
27,1589,"Oct 23 2006 	Good price Great Location	We booked the Quality Hotel Downtown for a girls trip to Montreal. The price was extremely frugal ($45 USD on Priceline.com). Although with the parking ($15/day) and the charge of $10/day for a non-smoking room, drove the costs up a bit. Priceline had originally booked us into a smoking queen room but we needed two doubles non-smoking. I had called ahead to the hotel twice to request that but was told that I would have to take my chances at check-in. Luckily, we did get the room we wanted.We loved the hotel for it's convenient location...it's within walking distance to St. Catherine and only one block away from St. Laurent.The rooms were clean and the beds were hard and comfortable. Pillows were a bit lacking so if you're picky about those, I suggest bringing your own.It's nothing fancy but it was perfect for us."
28,1589,"Aug 22 2006 	Excellent value for money!	We didn't have any idea what to expect with this hotel &amp; we were pleasantly surprised. We had a 2 night stay &amp; found this hotel to be awesome. Great location, very friendly front desk staff. Rooms clean &amp; good size. Supermarket across the road. Metro station 2 blocks away. Very happy to stay here again."
29,1589,"Jul 3 2006	OK hotel	We stayed two nights - Sunday &amp; Monday - as part of a touring holiday.Checkin was a little slow as we had a trainee, but very polite and clear. We parked the car in the car park (under the hotel) and left it until we checked out.The room was OK - outlook onto the graffitti on the next building. Reasonably clean.We found the location a little off-putting - not the beggars that another reviewer commented on - they seem to be in any big city, but depending on which way we went the area changed drastically. Going east seemed a shabby, run-down area with &quot;adult&quot; shops &amp; entertainment. West was definitely up-market.We walked south to the old-town area - under 15 minutes and also had a similar walk back from Mont Royal.We ate the second morning in Werby's the lobby restauarant where the staff were deluged by a school party &amp; still coped quickly &amp; in a friendly manner, apologising for the delay, which we had barely noticed.Overall we would say the hotel was OK for the money, but we wouldn't enthuse."
30,1589,"Oct 12 2005	Great Experience!!!	I stayed at the QH Downtown from October 7-11, 2005. To be honest, I really expected the worst based on some of the reviews below. However, I was absolutely surprised and pleased with my stay at this hotel and would definitely stay here again in the future.1) The hotel is located one block away from Sherbrooke, one of the main streets in Downtown Montreal. It's also a 10 minute walk from St. Laurent (&quot;The Main&quot;), one of the most ultra-hip and exciting streets in the city. It sits on the edge of downtown but is closer to The Plateau, the artistic district of Montreal. (Great inexpensive restaurants and bars in the area, including some restaurants where you can bring your own wine!) It is also less than a 5 minute walk from Jeanne Mance (ever seen photos of the iron staircases in Montreal? Chances are they were taken on Jeanne Mance street.). 2) The hotel is directly across the street from Provigo, a well-stocked and clean grocery store (check out their pastry section!). It was WONDERFUL (and inexpensive) to zip across the street and pick up provisions for the weekend. 3) The only problem I encountered was that the movie channels would not work when I arrived. Rachelle at the front desk went above and beyond to try to get them to work again Friday evening and continued to follow up with me throughout the weekend to get them functional. 4) The restaurant was closed while I was there, but there is a local restaurant (Alto - pick up a menu in the lobby) who will deliver as late as 5:00 a.m.!!! Good food, quick delivery. I highly recommend their pizza. 5) I found the front desk staff to be accommodating, warm, and very helpful. They went above and beyond to ensure I had a good stay. All in all, it was a very good experience. Granted, this isn't a four star hotel, but you get a great value for the price."
31,1589,"Sep 22 2005 	It's not bad	It is fine if you just want a base from which to explore the city. It is nowhere as scary as the &quot;Never Again&quot; post would indicate. I got spooked by that post and ended up booking another hotel for the first three days of my stay. Yes, that other hotel (2.5*) is head and shoulders above the 2* Quality Downtown, but if you happened to get this hotel from Priceline, don't worry and enjoy your stay as long as your aim is to explore the city instead of worrying about the service level of your hotel.The neighborhood is a mix of downtown businesses and student housing. On Sherbrooke, which is only 1/2 a block away, it's all businesses and posh hotels. On Ave du Parc, it's a mixture of convenient stores, restaurants, outdoor cafes, and a supermarket. The hotel is also within walking distance of the Metro and St. Laurent where a lot of Montreal nightlife takes place. The point is if McGill students managed to live through 4 years of their education living in this neighborhood, you'll be OK for a few days."
32,1589,"Aug 24 2005	Quality is Adequate	Me and a few friends just returned from a weekend stint at this hotel. As said before this hotel is a 3 star. You get what you pay for. It provides you with the basics. A Room with A.C., adequate beds, trademark flat hotel pillows, and maid service. It is a great hotel because of its location. Close to Supermarket, Liquor Store, and the club scene and night life is all within walking distance. As said before last year I stayed at the Delta nearby on President Kennedy and that is a cut above but that is a 4 star and well you pay more. It's around $15 or so per day for parking in the garage. We just parked it when we arrived and took it out when we left. Close by to everything. We were on a floor with an ice machine. If you are in need for ice like we were it does the job but if you are looking for a large amount of ice in a short amount of time it may do the job but not real quick. Maid on the last day since we didnt ask for maid service sort of yelled/informed us about how &quot;NOT TO OPEN THE WATER&quot; she was saying not to open the bottle of water in the room that is on the table and just replace it with tap water and how she would know. Found that okay a little weird cause who is going to drink a medium size bottle of water that is $3.50? All in all no real complaints. When we requested more towels we got them. Front Desk when going in and out were friendly. If you plan on staying in the hotel for a while during the day when your not out then the hotel doesnt really have time consuming things. It is simply put ADEQUATE for people that just need a place to stay that will give you a place to sleep (in smoking and non-smoking) and any of the other basics. If you lookin for more its going to cost you more."
33,1589,"Aug 3 2005	Locationlocationlocation	I had a good deal in hotwire,it just us$45/night(tax not included) we booked the hotel for 5 nights,what can ask for this price in the downtown.The room is fine,the front desk is quite helpful.but the most important thing is the location,you can walk to metro for less than 5 min(but I can't imagine in the winter),the bus stop just the corner(check for the time ,30min in non-rush hour)if you want to the old montreal/chinatown, either bus or walk is fine ,it a straight road.Easy to access anywhere like shopping,sightseeing...There's supermarket across the street,very convenient,not only the supermarket,a bakery,couples of resturant,Cara is the place we went twice,try the breakfast, the crepe filled with lot of fruit,dip with nutella,very great.I saw some beggars beg for money along the streets,I experienced a beggar came to me for the money when I walked from the metro to hotel.And one night we saw a man slept at the front door of the hotel,few people looking at him,the staff of hotel came out and ask something ,then she returned to the hotel,it seems this happen before(a woman walking along and said he just faking always)So i advised girls to be watched out when you have to go out at night.One more thing,you have to pay $10/day for the high speed internet,really expensive,and when we called the service desk ask about the service detail,she gave us wrong information,the service should be from noon to noon,but the one one the phone said its from midnight to midnight,so be careful."
34,1589,"Dec 29 2004	Never again!	Firstly I think the reviews below are for the Quality Inn Downtown at 1214 Crescent St and NOT where I stayed which is Quality Hotel Downtown at 3440 av du Parc - even though they are part of the same hotel chain with similar names they are different.The hotel furnishing and fittings were a bit run down and not up to scratch. For example loose strands of thread on the sofa, a dodgy coffee maker, and in the bathroom a section of the wall that had been patched with filla but never painted / papered. There was a perma air freshener smell that hotels have, this one I think was apple blossom, but it was so awful and corrosive that it actually made my throat burn when in small places like the lift.The location was OK but not great, it is a number of blocks to Rue St Catherine, and I suggest you check on maps before booking if you want to be near certain things such as the Notre Dame Cathedral in Vieux (Old) Montreal. I ended up doing a lot of walking around the city just to get to somewhere, which in sub-zero temperatures is not always fun. There was a super market across the road, although I found a smaller but nicer one at the Galeries du Parc a few minutes away. There is also a good 24 hour internet caf across the street.My first morning there I was woken up at 7am by a work crew who were there to totally redecorate the communal parts of my floor. There was no attempt to be quiet. I had shouting, ladders clanging, singing, humming, loud conversations and electric sanding all just outside my door. There was no excuse for this. Their business is being a hotel and at the very least they should have mentioned it to me, but they could have put me on another floor or got the crew to start work at a more sociable hour for guests.When I compare this to what I got in Toronto and Ottawa for the same money there is no way I can consider this a good deal. I was wary about booking into any hotel with Quality in the name, but based on the other reviews (which I now know to be for a different hotel) I thought I would give it a go. Never again will I risk going to this hotel, there are plenty of other good hotels at the same price.PS I enjoyed Montreal, and hope to return soon for another vacation"
35,1589,Jun 3 2004	Good location good price.	My friends and I spent a few nights in this hotel and were pleasantly surprised. I guess we had low expectations but everything turned out great. The parking is in a secure garage and the food in the restaurant downstairs was great. We got a really good deal on the rooms from expedia so we weren't sure what to expect for the price. We were in walking distance to a lot of places and there's a grocery store right across the street. I'd probably stay there again if I ever go back to Montreal again. This is a perfect hotel if you plan on sightseeing Montreal and go places.
36,1589,"Jun 2 2004	bang for the buck it has lots of value	Great location, just 1 block off of the center of St Catherine street. Close to the local subway which I found so easy to navigate. Private Garage asures safe parking. Great resturaunt called Mango's adjacent to the hotel located on the main floor. ( they serve a great breakfast) and keep a well stocked bar. The Front Desk was an excellent help, always happy to make dinner reservations for us and never being off when recamending a place to eat or visit. The rooms were clean &amp; quaint, the bathroom is a bit small but definetly sufficent, the tub was deep enough for me to soak my 6 foot 240 pound frame which is nice after a day off treking around the city. Right accross the street is a full service grocery store(great for the budget concious) or if you just need something you forgot to pack. Considering I paid less then $300 for a 4 night stay I would recamend this hotel and may even stay there again. It would have been nice to have a few more amenities (like a pool) but hey I was there to see the city not lounge around a hotel."
37,1589,"Oct 20 2003	Cresent Street NIGHTLIFE!! NIGHTLIFE!!	The Quality Inn Downtown on Crescent Street 1 block south of St Catherines has been recently refurbished and is clean and safe. No it's not the Ritz but for $65-$90.00 USD depending on the season also consider the fact that within a 6 block radius of the Quality there is some of the best nightlife on this continent...!!!!!!!!!Restaurants, Cafes, Bars, Disco, Jazz, Rock, Irish, sophisticated to grunge, and when the bars close at 3 (If you have been there for a while they close the doors at 3 and let you stay till 4 usually drinking for free by now if you had been taking care of your bartender) now you only have a two short blocks to stumble home to your hotelWhen checking in ask for Jerry (one of the managers) introduce your self to him and he will take excellent care of you!!

4,1590, but now all of sudden there was a sudden urgency for us to leave the room. This was also very unprofessional. After a few minutes of arguing the clerk did allow for the late checkout. This is all without mentionning the poor state of the room: - the tub would not drain properly - several towels during the week were dirty with blood stains or yellow stains - the toilet was unstable - the bed was uncomfortable - the air conditionning only worked intermittently - the curtains were dirty and stained

It was fairly clean but a lot of the fixtures in the bedroom and bathroom could do with updating. We opted to use the hotel carpark as on street parking can be very expensive, and we assumed that our car would be safe. On our second morning there we were woken by a phone call from reception telling us that the car had been broken into. The entire back window was smashed in and there were dents in the passanger side door. We spoke to the receptionist about this and he didnt care and told us that we should expect it as we were staying in downtown Montreal! Also, we later realised that 2 mins walk from the hotel, there was a secure carpark where we could have parked our car in for an extra $3 a night! The secure carpark also has designated spaces for guests staying at the hotel. We asked the hotel staff why they never told us about the carpark, but they were unable to give us an acceptable reply. Overall, if you need somewhere cheap to stay in the centre of Montreal, then this place is ideal. If you have a car make be sure to use the secure carpark complete with cctv and security guards."
3,1592,"Jul 4 2009 	Smelly	We got here and noted that the halls and the room were rank . The hotel staff wasn't too friendly, but being from New England that did not bother me. The rooms were decent-sized and appeared clean except for that smell. The hotel was definitely not worth the low price we paid. Also, the walls are very thin and there was a very obnoxious group of American college kids there to party- why they decided to party in that place is beyond me. At any rate, it was noisy and smelly, and tough to get a good night's sleep. The location is good, except that it is right next to a strip club. But there are other hotels in the area and I can't imagine they wouldn't be better than this one! The reason we booked at this hotel was the location, and we figured we would not spend much time in the hotel but rather seeing the city. This was true, but I would have preferred a place at least with a neutral odor!"
4,1592,"Jan 12 2009 	DO NOT BOOK HERE!! Horrible experience will never return	The main reason we chose this particular hotel is we wanted to get the most bang for our buck. BIG BIG mistake. We arrived at the hotel around 3:30 pm on a Monday and went to check in. Was notified at that time, although guaranteed parking at the hotel, that we would be parking a block away in the public underground parking in the library for 10$ a day.Once we brought all our luggage into our room, which smelled of musky, stale smoke (we had to spray perfume, open a window and turn on a fan in order to get rid of the smell), we went to park our car and walked back to the hotel. As we were walking to our room, the front desk clerk (and owner, which we later found out) rudely informed us that we should respect the other patrons of the hotel and not be loud or we'd be kicked out. We found it extremely disrespectful considering the only reason he said this was because we were three young girls (20-22).We got to our hotel room to find that we only had 2 towels so we went down to ask for one extra as there were three of us, and he reluctantly gave us an extra towel. Every time we would leave the hotel, whether it was early in the morning for sightseeing and shopping, or later at night for dinner and dancing, the front desk would always ask us which room we were staying in, which we found to be a little odd. We didnt think much of it.On our third day at the hotel (new years eve), we arrived at the hotel after sightseeing to the police at the hotel. We later found out that over 1000$ worth of items and money had been stolen from a room on the same floor as us. The hotel does not provide safes and does not use swipe cards for their rooms. We are provided with one key and the extras are all with the hotel staff. The owners denied having any involvement in the robbery, and refused to let the police search the housekeeping or owners vehicles or property for the stolen items... a little fishy in my opinion.The hotel staff, aside from one individual who worked the overnight shifts, are crooked and give horrible customer service. Not once did we feel welcome. We will never be back to this hotel and I hope you will chose another place to stay during your visit as well. Their staff are not trustworthy and completely ruined the one groups (who's property was stolen) new years and trip, along with ours.The fact that they asked what room we were in when we LEFT our rooms, random phone calls/hang ups late morning and early evening to see if we were in our rooms, etc... it all added up. DO NOT VISIT THIS HOTEL WHEN IN MONTREAL!! It may seem like a good deal at the time, however, I'd STRONGLY advise against it. Whether this incident was a one time occurance, I would hate to see this happen again to another group of travellers."
5,1592,Oct 6 2008 	Not worth the money	Excellent location. Better not to write about the rest
6,1592,"May 19 2008 	An OK hotel	I booked this hotel mainly for the price. We wanted to spend a weekend in Montreal, but without breaking our budged: I believe the price I paid was $76 plus taxes. I have to say  if you value your comfort and you want a big room with a big bathroom, this is NOT the place for you. This hotel must have the smallest rooms I have ever been in, though it was clean. It looks more like a hostel. I personally didnt care so much for the furniture, or TV, or for any of the other little things, as I was there just to sleep, not to spend my day. It is a very modest looking place though!! The breakfast was little but OK, though I could see how this is not enough for a guy. Also, the eating area was pretty poor looking  yet, I would not hold this against it. The pluses: the hotel is located close to many clubs and bars, and for young people this would be an ideal location. I didnt care much for most of those clubs, but the hotel is in walking distance (maybe a 20 min walk) from the more upscale clubs and restaurants. So if you dont want the hassle of finding a parking place in downtown and just ride the subway, returning to the hotel late in the night wont be a problem. Also, I would list the price as a plus. The staff was helpful, and we had no issues.The minuses: because it was close to so many bars, it turned out to be a very noisy location too. I mean, extremely noisy, because I am pretty tolerant myself. The parking could be an issue in the winter. We parked a block away, in the garage at Cegep Du Vieux Montreal which was I believe $15/night. There are cheaper options, but these are not covered parking lots, which may be an issue in the winter. And obviously, if you are all for comfort you will be a bit disappointed about this place. For instance we had to ask for towels because there weren't enough.Overall, this is a good place for young people traveling on a budget. You get what you pay for!"
7,1592,"Mar 6 2008	My Filthy Experiene With Unfriedly Service	This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. When we first arrived the person at the front desk demanded we pay for our 3 nights in advance,which I reluctantly agreed to,(that was a mistake!)When we entered our room there was stains all over the carpet it smelled and there was very poor lighting from 2 small lamps on the attached piece of plywood hanging from the wall. We figured we could endure, after all it was only 3 nights. when we got up the next morning we seen how bad this place really was with natural daylight. We figured that things may get better when they cleaned the room,mistake #2. When we got back from our sightseeing day our hotel room had not been cleaned, so I went down to the front desk to complain And was made to feel that it was my problem. Bear in mind that this was a weekend of the Presidents Cup and the $59 nights were now $129 nights. After the second night I had enough and went down to check out, at this time I was told that the hotel required 48 hours notice but they would be nice and only charge me for 1 night. I made my reservations over the phone and was not informed of any cancellation whatsoever . Overall,this was the worst travel experience I ever had. Did I mention this hotel is right next door to a strip club(sort of sleazy,no? )"
8,1592,"Nov 25 2007 	Perfect !	I stayed 1 night at Hotel Quartier Latin in a 2 double beds room in November. We were 4 University students going to Montreal to attend a Conference. I strongly recommend this hotel to everyone, especially young people who like night life, because, we have to say it, the hotel can't be in a better location. You are in the middle of everything, and St-Denis Street is all about hanging out with friends, visiting bars, and boutiques of all kinds. The room was perfect, very clean, a good size, a little small but perfect, TV, the washroom is very clean, no problem there, we also had a cute dormer window. The receptionists are also very very helpful, since we didn't know the city, they gave us a plan and helped us a lot. I have know negative to tell about our stay there. Maybe, one little thing is that we had let the window opened during the night and at 3h30 in the morning, we were waken up by people who left bars. But it didn't last long. Perfect perfect! Moreover, the building has recently been renovated. I recommand this hotel to everbody!!!!!! The fees are also so low!!!!"
9,1592,"Nov 13 2007	Perfect Location Nice Place	I found this hotel through Orbitz, and we liked it alot. It is in an old building so the rooms have that kind of old Europe size and character. Nice and clean, we enjoyed our 2 night stay. The rate was excellent, and we were centrally located to downtown so dining and tourist fun was all within walking distance. Short drive out to Olympic area. The only negative is parking. Parking isn't included and they only have a few spaces. Parking in nearby lots and on the street is manageable but inconvenient. I slept a few minutes late and got a parking ticket. There is a go-go bar nearby but the neighborhood is safe and friendly with nice shops and excellent restaurants."
10,1592,"Nov 12 2007 	We enjoyed our stay	I have visited Montreal three times this year. During our last visit, we stayed here and we found it to be quite reasonable for the price. I dont remember exactly how much we paid for our two rooms, but for the price, what else could you ask for? For young adults, the frills dont seem to be of as much more importance than having a bed to sleep in and a bathroom to use. We stayed for two nights. I dont thnk that the rooms were small at all. We had a window with a &quot;sort-of&quot; ledge i guess that you could sit on and look out on St. Denis. We never ate breakfast here, we always walked accross the street to the cafe. Its a great location, if youre there to have a good time and experience montreals nightlife. Shopping is great, no matter how much you walk. Honestly, i wouldnt want to experience it in any other way. We are planning to visit again in November. We have made reservations to stay here, i hope i dont experience anything like the rest of you have.Also, the other two times i have visited montreal, i stayed at econo and some other SMALLLLLL hotel in old montreal. I would recommend this hotel tremendously over the other two! Much cleaner, better location. I guess its a matter of opinion."
11,1592,"Sep 23 2007 	Horrible Hotel Experience!	My Fiance and I stayed in this hotel for a week in June. The location was perfect, right in the centre of everything. However, on leaving the hotel it was very obvious that my fiance had several items of his clothes missing. I have searched everywhere and the clothes were GONE!! When I contacted the hotel 3 days after checking out, they told me that the room still hadn't been cleaned, and said they would contact me if they found anything... I am still waiting for that return call."
12,1592,"Jul 20 2007 	Not luxury but great location	The room was dark and looked out on the air shaft. This actually was a bonus because we were staying when Montreal was having a street festival. Since we had an interior room, it cut out the noise from the street. The room did have dim lights and and could use some painting, but it was clean, the bathroom was clean and the door was secure. We also were able to pay for off-street parking. It's a good value if you are looking for cost and security and are not concerned with the frills. It also has a great location. Directly on Rue St. Denis, it is near a subway station and has many interesting restaurants within walking distance."
13,1592,"Jan 7 2007 	Moldy Misty Humid And No A/C	No air conditioning, hot humid days were with us in Summer 2006, and rooms were musty, hot and felt wet, moist, &amp; humid. My room door was open when I got there, propped open by a garbage can, presumably to get misty-ness out of the room before guests arrive. Rooms are tiny, beds are tiny - Hotel is right beside a strip joint. Rooms do not accomodate 2 people, bed is too small. Did I mention no AC? Lobby door of hotel is wide open to let air in. Not accessible, steep stairs. Staff aren't professional, it's some guy in early 20s, for about 20$ more I got a room at the Sheraton on Hotwire, and left the room at Quartier Latin, it was garbage it was not worth it."
14,1592,"Aug 30 2006 	Bad Hotel	The only great thing I can say about this hotel is the location. The price they charge for our stay (5 nights) was expensive. The rooms were unclean, the patio had lots of dirty bottles in addition to dirty windows. The towels well worn and our room was relatively small with old and well used dresser and night table. The TV was located above on a ledge whose shelf was very unclean. Our sheets were not changed at all during the entire week we stayed at this hotel. The staff unfriendly. This hotel did not accomodate for disabled with no elevator at all in the building. One had to pack your suitcase (s) to the entrance then to your hotel room. Never bothered with the continental breakfast. Would not recommend this hotel for anyone to stay in. Lastly, they charged my credit card for unknown cost in which I disputed and disallowed payment despite the fact, my hotel room was paid in cash for our 5 night stay."
15,1592,"Jul 19 2006	College Dorms Have More Charm	First, the good news: This hotel is inexpensive and in a very good location. Now, the bad news: This is a four story building without a working elevator. Hence, I had to schlep our luggage up four flights of stairs. They told me they have no elevator, but I found it the next morning with tape over the buttons. It was probably not working and they didn't feel like fixing it. We also had a problem with the airconditioning in our room, which by the way was the size of a walk-in closet. The hallways were ice cold. It took three phone calls the night we checked in to get someone to turn on the air. Each time we returned to our room, the air conditioning was off, yet the manager insisted it was working. I think they turn it off during the day when guests are out to save money. Then there was the continental breakfast, which consisted of 1 muffin or croissant, 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of O.J. I think they would be better off doing away with the free breakfast so they could save enough money to fix the elevator. Parking in the rear was adequate. The room was clean, but the towels were old and battered. Overall, if you need a place to sleep for a few nights and service is not your top priority, then I highly recommend this hotel."
16,1592,"May 23 2006	Can't go wrong either way....	After reading a couple of bad reviews of this place, my buddies and I thought that staying at this place would be a terrible idea--we were totally wrong. True, that this isn't exactly your Ritz Carlton, but remember that you get what you pay for. Don't expect a five-star hotel for $80 a night. It's basically your no frills hotel.Would this be a good hotel to bring the family? Maybe not. Is it a good place for young people to stay to save a couple bucks so they can party harder in Montreal? Absoutely.For a couple of young guys in our 20's, we had a memorable time in this hotel. Being on St. Denis, it's close to many popular restaurants, clubs, and bars. Interestingly enough, the hotel is right beside L'Axe strip club. That may be a good thing for some of you boys out there. It's also close to the St. Catherine scene (if you know what i'm talking about). And for those who like to party crazy until the sun comes up, Aria is just right down the street--the hotel is in a perfect location to stumble in for a late morning snooze. As well, the hotel is within reasonable walking distance to the popular St. Laurent club and bar scene.The hotel is crammed with many young money conscious people. So if you're looking for a couple of guys or gals to party with, this could be the place.There were a few negatives about this place:- First, the parking situation at the hotel was less than ideal. I did not trust parking my car behind the back alley of the hotel. Parking was very cramp and would only hold about 8-10 cars max. The parking was also very incovenient. You basically had to walk up to Ontario St. and then make your way down St. Denis to the hotel. - The rooms in the hotel are very small; however with some creative rearranging of the furniture, our standard one bed hotel room was able to house 3 guys and 2 air matresses.- Third, our hotel room had a really funky smell to it. The smell was so strong that I was able to notice the noxious odors while I passed out after a night of heavy drinking and partying.- Finally, the wake up call system was non-existent. We put in a wake up call for Sunday, May 21, 2006 at 11:00am and to this date we're still waiting for it; they never called. As well, there are no alarm clocks in the room, but thankfully cell phones have alarm clock features.The Latin Quarter definitely has some character to it. If you're looking to have a good time in Montreal and only need a hotel room to sleep, get intimate, and house your personal belongings, then this is the place for you. Montreal is a fantastic place with all its history, culture, nightlife, and most importantly, its dark-haried French beauties. It's a top-notch place to unwind and have a great time. When in Montreal, there's no need to be uptight. It's a great city and when you're having this much fun with all the things to do here, the hotel should be the last thing on your mind. Yes, I may have noted more negatives than positives, but I think this hotel rocks! I definitely would come back and stay at the Latin Quarter again; it's a great bang for your buck."
17,1592,"Apr 24 2006	Perfect Budget Hotel -- If you're not a crybaby.	I am utterly shocked at all the bad reviews about this hotel. Don't believe them!!! I'm 23 years old and have travelled extensively through Europe. If you are a young, budget traveller and have ever stayed in a hostel or pension, this place will make you very happy. It is rediculously cheap too. The location is amazing, especially if you are going to be going to nightclubs. We walked everywhere. I personally was extremely pleased. The staff was very helpful and spoke English. The towels were thin and scraggly but who cares, you are getting a budget hotel because you have no money, if you require plush towels then pay to stay somewhere nice, it doesn't take a genious to figure that out. The room was clean, the bathroom was clean. Since everyone is so hair obsessed on this site, here's what I have to say: There were 2 brown eyelashes on my pillow. I plucked them off the pillow and ate them because who cares about a couple of hairs?!!! You won't die. You won't even get sick. You won't get a disease. Brush them off. The sheets were obviously clean because they smelled like a fresh spring day. The room was BIGGER than expected. I was so inspired I hung up my clothes in the closet and put my socks in the drawers. I never do that. There was a TV. There was a hair dryer. There was soap. That is all you need. My girlfriend who is deathly afraid of bugs, hairs and stains and who refuses to stay in hostels was totally fine with this place. Not a complaint at all from her and that says alot.If you are an conservative adult who is used to staying in big chain hotels and never roughed it in your life, or you are the kind of person who demands an entirely new burger at a restaurant because they accidently put tomatoes on it and even if you take them off &quot;there's still a little bit of juice on it&quot;, or you used to tell the teacher when people cheated when you were in high school, or you correct people's grammar during ordinary conversation, or you home school your children... then don't stay here. You are obviously very uptight and picky. Go to the Holiday Inn where you can get all that complaining out of your system, snidely acting like a big shot when you tell the manager you are going to &quot;contact the regional offices about this.&quot; Hotel Quartier Latin is $60 Canadian for a room, are you nuts, what do you expect??!? Obviously this place isn't worth a 5. I mean its a 2 star hotel. But really, I was generally impressed by this place for the price. We got a double bed room for $74 Canadian. 2 couples sharing the room, we $20 each a night for our stay and loved every minute of it.PS- Budget minded, relaxed adults don't think that this is a &quot;party hotel.&quot; It was actually extremely quiet as well!!PPS- If you are under 25 years old and have a problem with this place, it's time to learn to &quot;chill out&quot; a little bit.COOL TRAVEL TIP:In this hotel, there is no stereo in the rooms... But the TV has auxillary inputs in the front. So, if you bring your iPod and the cable you use to connect it to a stereo (headphone jack to red and white plugs), you can plug that into the front of the TV and use the TV's speakers as a stereo!! Awesome!!"
18,1592,"Apr 11 2006	Disgusting Room	I was looking for a clean inexspensive room for a four day stay. I came across the Hotel Quartier Latin. I saw the pictures and thought well I am there for Montreal not the room. Upon arrival I found that the street was completely under constrution and that I could not drive up to the hotel. I had been in contact with the management just days before to confirm our reservations. The managment never once let us know that the street was completely torn apart. We tried several ways to get to the Hotel and finally just parked the car and walked. Once we got to the hotel there was only the cleaning staff and they only spoke french. I speak a some french and it was difficult to comunicate but we did understand each other. I was to go behind the hotel in a alley and find the rear entrance to the hotel and that is where I was to park. I didn't feel to good about leaving my car there but I had paid cash for parking. When we got to the room it was as big as a closet. I stripped the bed right away and found numberous hairs. Long black hairs. I both beds. The floor had not been vacuumed in days. It was digusting. Long hair and other stuff on the floor in the bathroom. I did go to the front desk and stated that I did not want the room. The young lady that was at the desk did not speak english but we were able to communicate that the manager would be there in just minutes. He arrived shortly and I explained that we were not happy with the room. He gave us a new room. It was bigger but the floor was disgustin. Stains everywhere. The floor had not been vacuumed in days. Again hair in the shower, long black hair. Hair on the floor. It was obviouse that the room had not been cleaned since the last person was there. We did decide to stay only because we were on a budget and also we felt that we would have a hard time to find another room since it was a weekend. The second day we asked the management to clean the room. Management with a stern and staight face tells us that the room will be cleaned that afternoon. We stated to him that the room had already been cleaned because the beds were made up but the floor was still dirty and that we had proof that the floor was not vacuumed and that there was long black hair in the bath room. He refused to see for him self and that he just continued to say the same thing over and over again that the room would be cleaned by the afternoon. Well it never did. We were there for four days and the room was never vacuumed or cleaned. It was the dirtiest room I have ever stayed in and i would never recommend the hotel to anyone. It was the one and only time I will ever stay there. It was just disgusting . As for the breakfast I never saw it, not even a hint of it. No service, no clean room, and the management could care less. Also the towels were the worst. Very linty and thin and scratchy. Just a bad experience from the get go."
19,1592,"Oct 3 2005	Great for the Price	After reading all the awful reviews i was nervous to stay at this hotel. The price was too good to be ignored though and my boyfriend and i kept the reservation. The hotel is in the center of the downtown montreal excitement. I would say this hotel is probably better for a younger crowd. This was all we saw for guests and it seemed apt. The walls are thin but except for a couple loud guys in the room next to us the last morning it was not a problem. The price we paid was near hostel prices and the accomodations were much more private with a full bath. The Creperie next door was wonderful as well, though slow service. We ate there both mornings. Staying away from the more touristy stuff we saw a lot of live jazz and blues for free. the artists were all friendly and interactive. Great stay over all. Better for people looking for a cheap place to stay instead of a romantic or a quite one."
20,1592,"Sep 26 2005	The Worst Hotel I have ever stayed	I selected this hotel because it was situated in downtown with most of the famous attractions within walking distance. Therefore the location was ideal. I and my husband stayed 2 nights. Our experience with the hotel during the 2 day stay is far from satisfying. First, the hotel staff is not friendly at all. They need to be taught how to smile! They did speak English which was very useful for us because we didnt speak French. But the staff needs to be trained on Personal Relations&quot; skills. We found them very unfriendly and depressing. Although the hotel advertises them as &quot;a friendly atmosphere with outstanding service&quot;, they are far from it.The rooms were small but manageable for a few nights sleep. I found the room and the bathroom to be surprisingly cleaner than expected. The free-continental b'fast cannot be called a continental b'fast at all. It is either one muffin or one croissant. Not both! The bfast was served by one of the staff. Why cant they allow the guests to serve themselves? On both days that we went to get bfast, the person who served the tea and croissant spilled the tea on my tray. I found them to be very clumsy and careless. How can this happen on both days??? Anyway, he did not offer to change my wet tray or the croissant. He just apologized and said he is new and offered an additional napkin!For parking, they charge $10 a day. If you park your car there, never, never hand your keys to the front desk. I was unlucky enough to hand them the keys so they car move the car within the car park. When I got in to the car the second day I found somebody has nipped my loose coins (kept to pay tolls) and a bag full of snacks away from the car and the hotel staff is clueless about it and wasnt very helpful when approached. We have stayed at many other hotels in the past and this hotel is by far the worst."
21,1592,"Sep 1 2005	What is everyone complaining about? It was great!	I guess there is no pleasing some people. From the moment my fiance and I arrived, we had a great experience.First of all, St. Denis proved to be such a cultural melting pool, with different ethnic cuisines everywhere you looked, and it literally begins at the base of the hotel steps. The maps and information located in the lobby proved to be indispensable, as well as the service from the front desk. Checkout time was a full 8 hours before our return flight home, but they offered to store our luggage while we spent another full, fantastic day wandering the streets downtown. Upon our return to the hotel, they had a taxi waiting for us! Couldn't have been more helpful. The Berri-Uqam metro station is a 2 minute walk away, and you will find 3 different major routes to access, that take you downtown, to close to Mount Royal, and following a short bus ride after the train, over to La Ronde and the FANTASTIC Casino Montreal (more fantastic due to the fact we left with more money than we walked in with!)As for the actual rooms, pretty small, but what more do you need from a room in Montreal than a bed, a TV, and a shower. Throw in a fridge to chill some wine, or a few beers, and fresh towels everyday, and who really cares about &quot;a smudge or two on the wall&quot;. A hair in the shower or sink? TURN THE WATER ON AND RINSE IT AWAY!!All in all, for $77 Canadian a night, we couldn't have imagined anything more perfect, and we plan on returning next year."
22,1592,"Aug 5 2005	Excellent Value Budget Hotel	If you are looking for a good value budget hotel right in the middle of Montreal's St-Denis street Nightlife you can't be better served. For a little under 60 Canadian Dollars I got a clean budget hotel in the center of town. I was actually looking on foot for something closer to where I usually go out at night than the Holiday-inn I had stayed in the year before was and for 1/3 the price I couldn't be happier. I don't spend much time in my room besides for sleeping, taking a shower and perhaps catching the news on the TV so in my case it did fine."
23,1592,"Aug 5 2005	Inexplicably bad service dirty rooms questionable honesty	My husband and I had a fine stay at the Hotel Quartier Latin earlier this year on the recommendation of a friend. Admittedly, the room was not as clean as it should have been -- there was hair in the shower and on the bathroom floor, and I'm still not sure what the smudge was on the toilet roll dispenser but I'd rather not think about it. But we were having such a good time we decided to let this slide, and booked again for July.What a mistake.I phoned in June and made a three-night reservation for late July. I received a confirmation number over the phone and assumed all was fine. When we arrived, everything again was fine, and I filled out a (completely blank) check-in card with my address, license plate info, etc. All seemed well and we settled into our very small but adequate room for two uneventful nights. There was a refrigerator in the room, great for my husband's medication, and the room was reasonably clean.On the morning of our third night, however, the problems began. The day clerk told us upon returning from brunch that he'd expected us to be out at noon. I explained that he was mistaken and we were reserved for three nights, and he said that was wrong and we would have to leave the hotel. I dug out my confirmation number and personal notes indicating the correct dates I had requested. The clerk, who had no real evidence to the contrary, attempted to convince me I had agreed at check-in that we were staying only two nights and that I had written it on the check-in card. This card was blank when I filled it in, and after the fact he had written in the dates to turn on and turn off the phone -- not real evidence at all. He then told me outright that I must be mistaken about the reservation because he would have tried to charge me $174 for the Saturday and not $89 as he had the previous two nights! Apparently there is no system for writing down reservations at the hotel with accurate information that he could show me, despite the fact that I had a confirmation number handy.The clerk attempted to call, or pretended to call, the hotel manager twice to discuss the situation and eventually said that he'd handle it himself since the manager &quot;probably wouldn't be as nice&quot; as he would. (?!?) His &quot;nice&quot; solution was to have us move rooms (why??????) and charge us not $89, $89 and $174, but rather $109, $109 and $109 for the three nights. Since I was reserved for $89, $89, and $89, I was put off to say the least. But since my husband is ill and we hadn't the time to reschedule anywhere else on a very busy night (with Gay Pride right behind the hotel -- hmm, do you think they were hoping we'd leave so they could get a better price?) we agreed to let the hotel charge us an extra $60 *just to continue staying there when we were already reserved*!Then we were not allowed to stay in our room since it was &quot;rented&quot; already, and were moved to a larger, much dirtier room! This room had no refrigerator, had black scuff marks on the wall next to one bed, hairs ALL OVER the sheets of both beds, and the bedside lamp was broken. It was an inexplicable and inexcusable &quot;solution&quot; to what was in the best case a mistake on their end, and the room was definitely not worth $109 no matter how busy a day it was. The clerk also tried to get me to pay him in total up front numerous times, despite having my credit card on file and my insistence that I would pay my balance in cash at check-out. Perhaps this was because he knew the next day's clerk was exceedingly bad at math, even with a calculator, as another reviewer mentioned. This actually worked in our favour as he failed to overcharge me *quite* as much as the other clerk had intended. I also complained at check-out about the dirty sheets and the clerk seemed confused and embarrassed, and when I mentioned that the lamp was broken, he just said, &quot;I don't know anything about the lamp.&quot;Add us to the list of &quot;never agains&quot;!"
24,1592,"Jul 9 2005	I should've taken pictures of the icky	If I had known I could post pictures to this site I would've taken photos of:1) The supposedly &quot;clean&quot; sheets which were covered in human hairs (well, by covered, I counted 18 different hairs). 2) The brownish/greenish/yellowish slimy mildew on the lovely, forest-photoed shower curtain.3) The weird stains on the carpet4) My boyfriend's face covered in white pills of cloth from the translucent towels. 5) The tacky picture that was fastened to the wall in an incredibly crooked position.6) The look on the staffer's face when I asked for new sheets (not nice).7) The cardboard bed.8) The yellow stains on the pillows.9) The bag of Fritos left behind from the last occupant.Overall, I don't expect much from a one-star hotel...but to me one-star is like a Motel-6. All i ask for are clean sheets, clean shower and a halfway decent mattress. Not here!First, there is no parking so be warned that you're going to have to park a block or so away which is about 40$ for 2 days. So it'll be worth spending an extra 40$ for a better hotel with parking.Second, expect to wait 25 minutes for someone to come to the desk to give you your key. We even tried calling the hotel from the front phone... the other phone just rang and rang and rang... Third, When dragging your luggage in, don't expect the staff to open the door for you. Instead, just let them watch you struggle.Fourth, When you ask for clean sheets, don't expect concern or even sheets right away. I got the inquisition even after I showed the guy all the hairs. He kept pointing to the creases telling me that was proof that they were clean. Fifth, you can't cancel a reservation completely. If you do, your cancellation fee is one night. You also have to give 48 hours notice. We wanted to cancel our 2nd night and were allowed the option of paying and giving up the room...even though they were sold out and could've sold it."
25,1592,"Jun 30 2005	Good deal for the price	Ok, this is a budget hotel, so everything feels kinda cheap, but for the price I felt it I got good value for money.We stayed there 4 nights, my wife and I had a double room (one double bed) and my sister stayed in a single room.The hotel does provide breakfast: coffee or tea, orange juice and either a croissant or a muffin (both from costco). Breakfast won't win any awards but for a budget hotel its nice to get something to start your day of site seeing not on an empty stomach. The rooms were of fine size, included a small table with two chairs, a small closet and dresser and a bathroom. There was enough floor space to open our suitcases and still walk around and use the table. There was no in-room coffee maker, but the TV worked fine. The hotel is centrally air conditioned but you can't control the temperature from your room, when we were there they tended to keep it a little on the cool side, which I liked though my sister did not. Location: The hotel is in lively rue St Denis which is just wonderful. It really comes alive at night (the street, not the hotel) and is full of great restaurants. Even late at night there are lots of people on the street (not scary at all) all going to and from the local eateries. During our four nights there we ate at a different restaurant every night, all were great and none were more than 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Note however, that the hotel is not in downtown, it's about 15-20 minutes walk from there. This is a short distance that I don't think will be an issue to a tourist who expects to spend the whole day walking from site to site. In any event, the subway station is only 4 minutes walk from the hotel, so it's not a big deal anyway.There is no parking in the hotel and the street is always packed. There is no elevator.Finally, do bear in mind that this is a budget hotel, so don't expect the level of decor or the quality of the furnishings to reach that of the more expensive chain hotels. If you keep in mind what you paid and use the money you save to enjoy eating out at one of the many fine restaurants on rue St Denis I think you'll be satisfied."
26,1592,"Jun 23 2005	The worst experience of my life!	This place is a dump! No parking, small rooms, dirty carpets, poor service from hotel staff, bad continental breakfast, etc. I visit Montreal quite frequently (3-4 times a year), and there are many other hotels that offer a better value in the downtown area. Don't even bother with this one!"
27,1592,"Jun 6 2005	Didn't give us our reservations!	This hotel looked great on the internet, from the outside, and in the lobby. However, when we arrived, we were told that &quot;there was water damage&quot; in our room and would not be able to stay there. However, they arranged for us to stay at the Hotel Europeene. Another bad choice. They &quot;forget&quot; reservations and try to pawn you off on a worse place."
28,1592,"Apr 5 2005	It was great!	We stayed there last summer in July 2004, during the Just for Laughs comedy festival. The hotel was right in the middle of the festival, which made getting there a bit confusing, but once we were settled it was great to be in the middle of everything. The room was small yet clean, and we had no problems at all with our stay there. I would definately reccommend it!"
29,1592,"Oct 7 2004	Cheap hotel in a central location if you don't mind a dirty room	My boyfriend an I stayed at this hotel this past weekend. The location's great for the price, but beware, rooms are not kept clean. We found hair in the bathtub, the sink and in our sheets. Another thing to beware of is that the heat and air conditioning is cotrolled at the front desk. We had to constantly call and ask to have the air conditioning put on. Very disapointed, would not return."
30,1592,"Aug 9 2004	Good Hotel for the Price	For the price, this hotel is a very good buy. It is not a five star hotel, and does not claim to be. There is no elevator but you can get some assistance with taking your luggage up if you wish. The staff was most cheerful and courteous. We never came in or went out without someone greeting us. The cleaning staff was efficient. The contenintal breakfast was served with a smile and the croissants were warm and the muffins fresh. Children were treated very kindly. Rooms are small, but beds are comfortable and clean. (Who cares what you see when you look out the window.) We went for the Montreal Jazz Festival and were just a short walk from the main stage. For the money, you cannot find anything more satisfactory. And frankly, we did not see any ants as was mentioned in another review."
31,1592,"Jul 26 2004	Fantastic Location and Decent Value But the Staff is Inconsistent	I stayed here for two nights from 24-25 July 2004, in a single room, #410, on the top floor for C$69+tax. Although my floor was technically the 4th floor, the 2nd floor was actually street level and 1st floor the basement, so I only had to haul my luggage up 2 flights of stairs. I found my room adequately clean, basically furnished and ok-sized, given that this is a budget, European-style hotel (i.e. small rooms and few frills). At least I could move around the room without having to worry about banging my arm or feet against something. My room was at the back of the hotel with a view of the back alley and some parking lots beyond, but I did manage to get a glimpse of the fireworks on Saturday night when the International Fireworks Competition was active. The TV with cable channels was quite well sized for the room, probably 21-inch. The rationed breakfast was available in the breakfast room during the short time frame of 8-10am, and I never bothered to eat there because of the wealth of cafes and breakfast places immediately outside the hotel. Parking is available in a parking lot 1-2 minutes away by foot, but the price varies from free to C$10, depending on how busy the hotel is and who you speak to. Basically the hotel maintains a couple of monthly passes at the lot which they then give to guests. I stayed during a busy weekend (much of the Latin Quarter was pedestrianised for the Francofolies festival) and paid C$7 per day for the parking. The staff can be friendly, but the guy who did my bill was lousy with math (even with a calculator), so check your bill carefully. The biggest selling point of the hotel is the location - close to the UQAM subway station and the Central Station for trains, and right in the middle of the Latin Quarter on rue St-Denis. One will not starve or thirst here."
32,1592,"Feb 23 2004	Basic but in a great location	This is a basic hotel, but clean, cheap, and in a great location.It's surrounded by lively restaurants - there's a great vegetarian buffet across the road, and Italian, Thai, pizza, Chinese etc just a few doors away. There is a university in the area, so there are lots of people out and about till quite late and it feels quite safe. It's toward the fringes of the restaurant area, so the rooms are quiet.It's very easily walkable to Old Montreal and, if you like walking a little further, to many other great areas. Although there's no parking onsite, it's only one block away from a major subway station. The subway will take you around town and to all major tourist attractions, and also to the shuttle that goes to the airport.The rooms are small, but adequate, and have a small refrigerator. The views are of the surrounding streets etc, but if you're going there for the location and price, they really don't matter! The tvs only have basic channels, so plan to see Montreal while you are there!Breakfast is simple, but nice, with croissants, muffins, various cereals, juice and coffee, and they will try to give you as much as you can carry!CONS: There are no laundry facilities, however we were told that there was one nearby if we needed it. There was also no iron available, so bring non-wrinkle fabrics, but they do provide drawers and hangers. If you like thick toilet paper and towels, bring your own, but they will happily provide more if you need them. Next door is a strip club, but it has pleasant security guys, you can't see in, and the rest of the area is nice. It never bothered us, however if you are taking your family and don't want to explain what it is ....In conclusion, this is a great budget hotel (we paid approx CA$70), in a lively and convenient location. We recommend it to other budget travellers, but don't expect luxury."
33,1592,"Oct 14 2003	Very frustrating stay	We researched hotels (but unfortunately not the previous and very accurate review that someone else already left) and found this hotel in the heart of the city. We paid $120 a night for what we were told was a very nice, large room. The room was smaller than any hotel room I'd ever seen. The carpets were gross, there was NO parking (and I had been guaranteed parking when I called as I knew we were arriving at midnight on a Friday). After 7 hours of driving and just wanting to get settled, I arrived and was told I had to drive around crowded city streets and try to find an open lot with space. I never saw any sort of breakfast.We ended up cancelling the rest of the nights and went to the Holiday Inn. It was the same price for a very nice exective room in a clean hotel with concierge, an indoor pool, gym, sauna, parking and city views. I can't believe the Quartier Latin was charging as much."
34,1592,"May 27 2003	Worst Hotel I Have Ever Stayed In! Beware!	I went to this hotel because Orbitz showed that it was 2 star, close to Catherine St., city view, and parking available. What A Lie! It was close to Catherine St, however, there was NO parking, in fact we had to park in a garage two blocks away and make two trips back and forth to our car in the parking garage, the cost of parking was expensive. Our room was on the fourth floor (no elevevator) and the room was overlooking the &quot;city&quot; which was really just a dumpster out back. It gets worse... I left a bag of cookies on the nightstand and went out for a few hours, and when I came back there was a huge ant infestation in the room, all over my clothes, in my bed, and all over the cookies. I told the person at the front desk, and at first he suggested we spray the ants with something to kill them, after enough arguing, he agrees to move us to a new hotel, two blocks away... making all our belongings 4 blocks away from our car. WHAT A PAIN IN THE ***!!! Not to mantion the room is the size of a broom closet! Oh yeah, the continental breakfast is a frickin muffin and a croissant that they must have bought down the street... and out front the sign reads &quot;bead and breakfast.&quot; Dont be taken for a fool! BEWARE!!!"
35,1592,"May 3 2003	A good cheap stay!	We took a chance on this cheap hotel ($64 CA a night) and were pleasantly surprised. It is pretty basic, but was very clean and new, and had a comfy Queen sized bed. The location was amazing, right in the heart of a bustling area. If you are looking for a place under $100 a night, I'd recommend it!"

1,1595,Nov 16 2009 	Good Business Hotel	The hotel is located very close to Atwater Metro station and is nicely located very close to Montreal Downtown. This is a pure business hotel with decent breakfast and good rooms to stay. The building is very old. However the rooms are well maintained and there is a pool and GYM at the top floor of the building. There are no restaurants inside the hotel but a 5 minute walk from the hotel gives u lots of options to eat out. A very nice and good Value for Money hotel for business travellers.
2,1595,"Oct 24 2009 	Residence Inn Montreal Westmount: Good location! friendly helpful staff!	This is not your standard Residence Inn like ones in the U.S. A friend recommended this Inn based on its location. I had my doubts since I didn't have good experience at Residence Inns in the US on two previous stays. I was pleasantly surprised by this Residence Inn for its cleaniness, good location, and friendly staff.What I liked:+ Full breakfree+ Helpful, friendly bilingual staff + Good location - close to downtown Montreal business districtWhat I disliked:- parking"
3,1595,"Oct 21 2009 	Friendly helpful staff. Good breakfast and good location.	Hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Hotel lobby was very clean and inviting. We stayed here because we needed the separate bedroom and kitchenette for a family (parents and toddler). Hotel offered a crib free of charge, but we had our own. Our rate included free breakfast in the lobby restaurant which was very good. Offered was eggs, waffles, pancake, bacon, sausage, variety of breads and bagels, cereals, fruit, yogurts, coffee, tea and juices. Nice location on a quiet residential street near Dawson College. Two blocks away is Atwater Metro station. If you have a car, there is a nice outdoor lot two blocks from the hotel on Rue Sherbrooke. The rate is 7$ CAD per day. You pay by leaving exact change in an envelope in a mail slot. Lot is very safe and spaces are always available. No attendant, come and go as you please. Also two blocks away is Rue Sainte-Catherine. There you will find all sorts of restaurants; easily walk-able. Also, where Atwater Metro station is, there is a shopping mall that offers retail stores, a supermarket, and even a discount store similar to a Wal-Mart."

Clean, nice spacious rooms with kitchen. and a complimentary breakfast buffet. Underground parking, and a nice friendly bilingual staff."
5,1595,"Jul 10 2009 	Not the best Hotel	I stayed at this hotel for 10 nights with my husband who is in Montreal on business. Here what I wish I had known before being stuck there.The pool is very small, the photos on the web site make it seem much bigger. The &quot;sauna&quot; is a closet sized room in the individual bathrooms. The pool and fitness room closes relatively early (as do most places in Montreal). i asked if I could sit on the Patio, apparently it is more commonly referred to as a terrace, but no I could not sit outside in the sunshine, this was reserved for special use by the hotel. Several times the elevator got stuck on our floor, the doors would open, close, open, close. When we told the front desk he just said the elevators were old and sometimes you had to jump up and down a little to get it to work...c'est la vie!! Unbelievably I actually tried this, it didn't work. The balconies off the rooms seem like an after thought in the construction of the building, slabs of concrete, jutting out and pitched slightly at an angle downward, I assume to let the water run off from the cooler, which seems to be a swamp cooler, in a place with 80% humidity??? It was very, very noisy. The internet works well enough, but it's not wireless, like wireless internet is some newfangled technology in Canada. There was no table to eat at in our room, which was smaller than the suites. My husband's employer PRE-PAIDED for this room, but they tried to check him out prematurely twice. They also charged $200 to the credit card he gave (for things we might charge to the room) 5 DAYS AFTER WE CHECKED IN!! The explanation given by the front desk was they had to &quot;make sure the card worked&quot;, so they arbitrarily charge $200, 5 days after we check in, without informing us they are going to do this. Front desk guy defended this logic saying &quot;all hotels do this&quot; and that &quot;What if we put a hole in the wall&quot;...Ummm, not any I've stayed in. And finally, the parking in expensive, $17.00 a night.OK, here are the positives, for me, anyway. The beds were comfortable and the pillows down. The maid would do our dirty dishes for us. The room was clean. There is a laundry downstairs, $1.50 Canadian to wash and dry. There is a pretty big free breakfast. It's close to the metro (Atwater) and Starbuck.Here's my advice, if you're over 22, stay in old Montreal. This is a college neighborhood, a little weird, and not a lot for a tourist to do."
6,1595,"Jun 28 2009 	Well run hotel	I'm staying here for a long period, for business travel. The rooms are large, reasonably well fit out, and with a simple kitchen, and balcony. The staff are helpful, there is a good breakfast included, and the rooms are clean. There's a basic gym and pool on the top floor.. with a nice view of the mountain.An extra lift would be appreciated... 2 lifts for 20 floors leaves you waiting quite often."
7,1595,"May 11 2009 	Nice people hard beds.	If you don't mind sleeping on a brick, the place is nice. Another drawback is no hot tub, (which you will need by the end of the long walks you will be taking). Good breakfast with a lot of choices."
8,1595,"Sep 29 2008 	Not up to par at all	Stayed for a weekend at this hotel. I usually check reviews for any hotel that I am planning to stay at and this was no exception. This hotel has very decent reviews here and other places. I was very disappointed however and I am not a picky traveler, just want to get my moneys worth.I was surprised at how small and uncomfortable the rooms were and how old/dated the rooms/things in the room were. It was nice to have a kitchen but everything was old. The bed was small and uncomfortable, the sheets old and torn in some places, same with the towels. You dont expect this at a Marriot.The room was clean but old and uncomfortable. This hotel is advertised as 3-4stars but it is no way even close. It was like staying at a decent motel. However the price of $150.00 per night is insane for this place. It is not worth half that price. I stayed at 4Seasons last year for the same price in a much better hotel in a better location.Location is ok but nothing to write home about, you are better off staying on Sherbrooke between University and St. Laurent. There was always street parking available nearby so that is a plus. it was also nice to have a balcony, but it was not very useful since they dont even have any chairs or anything out there and you cant even smoke cigarettes on the balcony. I am not a smoker but it seemed like a strange rule for an outdoor balconyOverall it is a decent motel experience but really bad for the value. For 150 a night, I expect way better rooms."
9,1595,Sep 2 2008 	Worst Hotel Ever...Ever	I personally prefer to stay at the Residence Inn (Business or Leisure). This was the worst hotel I have stayed at so far. Our stay started with the horrible parking experience. There were about 10 parking spots per floor in the underground parking. I had to wait there for about half an hour to find an empty spot. Then there was the elevator wait. I stood by the elevator for 15 min every time for it to arrive(I was on the 7th floor and started using the stairs in and out after experiencing the same problem about 2 times). Then there was the room. The fridge was at least 20 years old with a loud squeaking noise. Old carpet with a nasty smell. The balcony was filthy with algae on the floor from the water leaking out of the air conditioner. The front doors squeaked. The thermostat did not work. There was no exhaust in the washroom. The sofa bed was the most uncomfortable nights sleep ever. And they charge $1 for every local call.Upon complaining about the above the response from the front desk was &quot;We are working to make things better&quot;. They did not offer any fixing or regrets.Never again will I stay here. I travel quite a lot to Montral. I would suggest the four points hotel (Same price much better service with the valet parking).
10,1595,"Sep 2 2008 	Location OK Service Great Lots of kids	I booked this hotel with Marriott Reward Points, so I cannot comment on prices and value. This was a last minute trip as I re-routed to avoid Hurricane Gustav and did little or no advance planning on he trip which required a higher level of staff assistance than I would normally ask for.Getting there: The hotel is located in a residential area of Montreal about 2 miles west of downtown. If you have two or more people, its probably not a bad idea to get a cab directly to the property. The flat rate of C$38 is competitive with the C$30 fare for two people on the L'Aerobus shuttle service from the airport. If you do take the bus, you will get dropped off at the main bus terminal. From there you can go downstairs to the Berri/UQAM metro station and ride to Atwater. Come out of the station on the Rue Maisonneuve side and walk a half block north on Rue Atwater to Lincoln. The hotel is a block down past a couple of old apartment complexes.Check in: Slow. The hotel had a couple of groups checking in at that time and the check-in desk has room only for two agents to handle the load. They did the best that they could.Room: Small. When I was promised a double room, they weren't joking. Its a double bed rather than a queen which is a good bit smaller than I am used to. Appliances in the kitchen look really old, but are functional. There is a small den area with a desk and a large balcony. Internet is free in the room, but as is the case with Marriotts I stay at, it is not wireless. But when its free, I will take what I can get. The toilet did not flush when I arrived. But it did get fixed almost immediately after I notified the front desk.Staff service: Really great. As I said, I was in a bot of a pinch and did virtually no advance planning. The staff was able to help me out with opening and closing times, directions and recommendations. This was pretty key since Labor Day is a holiday in Canada at the same time as in the US. Everything is closed on Labor Day. Overall, very friendly and cheerful folks and I am glad they were there.Breakfast: Big fan of the free Residence Inn breakfast. But this is a family hotel if every I stayed at one. Breakfast was overrun with kids and the atmosphere was more Romper Room than hotel. I suppose that makes it &quot;family friendly&quot;. But it also means that I also lost my breakfast plate a couple of times dodging the kiddies running around. Still it was a generally good selection of breakfast foods.Overall impressions of the hotel were OK. The biggest problem here is not something that will surprise the staff if they read this. Its the elevators. If you are above the 10th floor and want to go downstairs, plan ahead. If the elevator is not headed in the direction you want, get on. Ride it up and then back down. At least you are on, which is more than I can say to some of the poor souls who found a full elevator when it arrived at their floor.This really isn't a pheonomenal location for exploring Old Montreal but its OK. Atwater requires a change of train to get to the Orange Line and it can be a bit of a walk at the end of the day when you are beat to get back to the metro and then back to the hotel. Still, you are only two stops away from Peel Station which is where a lot of the action is on Ste Catherine Street. Given the choice, I would have tried to get a room downtown or in Old Montreal. I think the prices are generally competitive with the 3-star set downtown."
11,1595,"Aug 28 2008 	Reasonable rates and very comfortable	This hotel is a little out of the way - but close to the metro station.It was very reasonably priced and includes a fully equipped kitchen and a little balcony.The staff are really friendly and helpful - even to an English speaker like me.Very reasonable and comfortable,"
12,1595,"Aug 28 2008 	Clean Comfortable Good Value	I stayed at the Marriott Westmont recently for four nights. I was with my wife and 11 year old son. We got a special deal so the rate was very competitive, particularly because it includes a full hot buffet breakfast every day. The breakfast is not brunch at the Ritz Carlton, but it was always a nice start to our day. Our room was a suite with a fully equipped kitchen as well as a balcony offering a panorama of the city. It was clean and in very good condition. The hotel has a nice rooftop indoor pool which we used a couple of times. The parking garage with in/out privileges was another nice feature. The only complaint I share with others is the elevator situation in the hotel; there are only two and at peak times you may wait for up to five minutes to get one. I travel frequently and in general I am a big fan of Marriott, they are very customer focused and their product is very consistent, The Westmont is no exception."
13,1595,"Aug 17 2008 	Great Hotel	My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights recently. The room was neat and clean - we had a bedroom, living room, balcony and kitchen stocked with everything you'd need if you wanted to stay in and cook. The breakfast was wonderful - hot and cold food, lots of variety and nicely laid out. The staff were very friendly and helpful - the front desk recommended several nearby restaurants - we tried two and they were great. It's located in a very pleasant neighbourhood. The metro is only two blocks away, and from there you can get anywhere in Montreal quickly and efficiently. Old Montreal and China town are ten minutes away by Metro, and the botanical gardens about twenty minutes away. Overall - a great place to stay."
14,1595,"Aug 2 2008	Great Service!	This is a great hotel with excellent service. Right near Attwater subway and huge shopping centres, its close enough to the city and restaurants. The service is fantastic and we enjoyed a great apartment with kitchenette and spacious surroundings. We would recommend this hotel for its functional rooms, great staff, good breakfasts and position."
15,1595,"Jul 21 2008 	Residence Inn Montreal Westmount not up to par	I generally prefer staying at the Residence Inn chain. I don't know if the standards for the properties is lower in Canada versus the United States but this place was expensive for what it offered. First, while the room had a kitchen(outdated!) there was no dining table nor chairs nor a sofa and coffee table (as I have experienced at other Residence Inns). Secondly, the bed was hard as a rock and the carpeting was so thin, there was no doubt you were walking on a concrete slab floor. Thirdly, while the public spaces were newly decorated, the rest of the space felt like an old apartment building that had been converted into a hotel. If you like Residence Inns, I wouldn't recommend this place. If you are looking for a nice hotel, I would shop around because this wasn't even a nice hotel."
16,1595,"Jul 12 2008 	Good hotel but OLD and not close to anything	The hotel was good, but the elevator was not working for a while, and there is only one computer downstairs to use for internet.Room was clean and nice... but you can tell the hotel is OLD.When I flush the toilet the sink does not have cold water until the toilet fills up.And this hotel is not close to the good stuff in Montreal, so look for other hotels if you want to be close to all the big events in Montreal.I paid $149, would only stay here again for $120 tops."
17,1595,"Jul 9 2008 	Just OK - family with young children	This hotel has a lovely lobby and a wonderful breakfast. The staff were very nice.The room we were in was in bad need of renovation, though. It smelled of smoke (gross!!!) even though it was supposedly non-smoking. The rooms were redecorated maybe in the 80s, so things look a bit tired and old there. Also the toilet kept clogging. All the thresholds of the doors we saw had these huge bump-like lips, making them difficult to traverse with a stroller (and I'll bet a wheelchair too). Wheelchair accessible door button did not work from outside the hotel, either."
18,1595,"Jan 21 2008	Good apartment style hotel	I've stayed in this hotel multiple times for business and it is a nice apartment style hotel. There have been times when the room that I was given had problems with hot water. I mentioned this and was told to keep the water running for awhile. Othertimes there weren't any problems with the hot water. The reception desk will call you about 30 minutes after you check in to verify that everything is okay. This is the only hotel that I've stayed at which does this. The gym is okay (1 treadmill, 1 stairmaster, free weights). Being an apartment style hotel, it has a full size fridge (with freezer), a stove, utensils, pots, microwave, dish washer, etc. which I find to be very useful. They sometimes have free early evening snacks depending on the day (schedule posted on fridge). The free breakfast buffet is very good. The parking is indoor (pay $) and underneath the hotel (accessible from hotel without exiting). The parking allows for multiple ins/outs and you pay per day/stay. The hotel is located in a quiet 1 way side street at the outer edge of downtown (near westmount). It is considered to be downtown for all intensive purposes. The hotel is completely non-smoking. The free internet is wired."
19,1595,"Aug 8 2007 	Very Good Value	I recently stayed at the Residence Inn in Westmount for two nights on business. I am from Montreal originally and know the area well. The location is very good, being close enough to downtown without being &quot;too&quot; close. It is on a quiet sidestreet and although the building looks fairly ordinary (cement highrise) the interiors are spotless. Check in was fast and efficient, and the rate of $129 / night was more than reasonable considering what other downtown hotels charge. Their underground parking is for small cars only (they warn you about this), and there is plenty of street parking nearby which is free from 8 pm to 9 am. I would save the $$$ and park on the street.The rooms are very well kept, with full kitchenettes (a microwave, a range and a fridge). The only minor issue was with the noise level of the AC, which could be better. But it was not something that kept me awake. The hot breakfast (included) is outstanding and far superior to the usual boring fare. Very good quality buffet-style food, with yogourts, breads, cereals, etc. Top notch.This is not a &quot;luxury&quot; hotel, but is an excellent value. I will certainly stay there again and highly recommend it to anyone."
20,1595,"Jul 26 2007 	Great room and view	Our family stayed here during our recent summer vacation. We arrived quite late (22:00ish) and the girl at the front desk gave us a reception that we thought we were in Paris :-( However, the next morning, the continental breakfast is something else; the waffle is so good I can sit there and eat them all day. The room are comfortable but for those who are afraid of height, get the room on the lower floor. Otherwise, the view from our room is marvelous (we are on the 18th floor) ! Don't expect the american standard of Residence Inn (ie. soap, tissue, ... ) there's none whatsoever. One precaution: imo, the room may not be sound proof ( I can hear my children running in the room from the elevator). The swimming is small but if your room does not have the view, come up to the PH floor and have a great tan !"
21,1595,"Jan 12 2007 	Wonderful Property	Stayed at this property Jan 5-9, 2007. The location is a little ways out from the &quot;tourist&quot; areas, but it was not a bad walk to Rue St Catherine or Blvd Maisonneuve were one could find plenty of restaurants and shops. The metro (which gets you to many sites in the city) was only 2 blocks from the hotel. The neighborhood is not beautiful but encountered no problems, hotel exterior is blah but the lobby/public areas are very comfortable. Checkin/out was very quick and efficient, the hotel personel were very friendly - greeted everyone in English &amp; French and then in the guests language on subsiquent meetings. The room was basic - but all I need is a good bed and a bathroom. The room had those plus a balcony and a fully equiped kichen. Our room was next to the elevator but the bathroom blocked any noise from it &quot;entering&quot; the rest of the room. It was nice to have the option of the buffet breakfast - the menu was scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, waffles, a variety of cereals, fruit, yogurt, and breads/pastries. Very good selection. The pool was on the top floor and very nice (on a clear day probably had a great view). Will definately stay at this property on future visits to Montreal."
22,1595,Oct 29 2006 	Wonderful stay	when i arrived at the hotel in Montral i was greeted by the housekeeping staff on strike... apon checking in the hotel and arriving in the room i open the curtains and to my shock there was dirt on the outside of the window (there were doing renovations on the balcony) breakfast was good the staff was not very helpful at all sent me in the wrong area twice when i received the proper directions the front desk manager i was quite pleasant and gave me the directions for the area I was looking for. I will say this staff over all was exactly was I expected in a Marriott property.
23,1595,"Jul 24 2006 	Not bad but not really a hotel	I have to say first that the Residence Inn was once a medium sized apartment building that has been converted into a hotel. So, keep that in mind. First, the hotel is very clean; rooms, foyer, etc. I never saw any problems whatsoever, and I like rooms clean! My friend stayed there 3 years ago, and I stayed there (with same friend) in July 2006. I'm not too sure about the $175 cdn per night, think it could be more like $120?The lobby is just like in the pictures. As mentioned by others, there are only 2 elevators, so you may have to wait a little bit, but not terrible. The free breakfast wasn't bad. My friend mentioned that is was a continental breakfast, but there was cereal, yogurt, small pancakes, sausage patties, scrambled eggs, bread, bagels, juice, tea and coffee. You could eat here no problem, but the pancakes were a little dry and flat :( They also have free hors-d'oeuvres about 4 nights during the week. One night they had chicken nuggets, salad, mini quiche, bread rolls, juice, and coffee/tea. So, having said that, I will say that if you are used to big name hotels that have the nice buffet set out, looking all pretty, you will not find it at the Residence. It is much more casual fare, something you may throw together for yourself and your kids if your were at home, but still laid out okay. The room in which they serve the food is small, and can be a bit noisy. There are a number of tables out in the lobby area, which are more quiet, and cooler. We had a room on the 14th floor, which was clean and bright. The furniture was clean, did not appear well used at all, and was comfortable. I slept in the king size bed in the bedroom, and my friend slept on the pull out couch. You have to make up the bed in the pull out, so be prepared for that--bed stuff is in the hall closet. I read stuff about the A/C being loud, but you know, that is with a lot of hotels, but not the big name ones. It wasn't extremely loud, but it reminded me of when my family and friends have stayed in motels with window A/C, so it is about that noise level, but it didn't bother us. There was plenty of space to put away clothing, etc. There is large closet in bedroom, along with drawers in chest. Also chest of drawers in living room in front of pull out couch. The kitchen is great, having all utensils, plates, pots, etc for you. Great size fridge, but microwave probably should be replaced. Stove was older, but very clean. There is a balcony for each hotel room, but, it is a standard apartment balcony, with no chairs or anything, and there is some water which is just from the air conditioner unit. Also, people may go out there to smoke, and our balcony had not been cleaned of cigarette butts. I didn't really care, because I would never use the balcony anway, but the &quot;dirtiness&quot; of it could turn people off.Now to the comments about the general area. Yes, this area of Montreal is not like being directly downtown. You walk down the end of the street, and you see graffiti, and some people don't take care of their gardens. It almost seems dirty looking sometimes. There are a lot of panhandlers/beggars, whatever you want to call them. I think Montreal needs to do a clean sweep of these people. That was one thing that turned me off, and may turn off a lot of tourists that are not used to that. You will have to walk by them (most of them are sitting) but be prepared for some of them to come right up to you. Again, just make a point of walking away. Most of these people were on the main streets, and also in downtown Montreal. This is a Montreal problem, cause they are everywhere.I will say that I never felt unsafe. I think the area might make you feel that way, just because it doesn't look great, etc, but my friend and I walked at night a few times, but there were also other people out, and we were okay. If you are someone who really likes the large name hotel experience (room service, large foyers, restaurant, lots of elevators, immaculate rooms, etc, etc), then do NOT go to this hotel. Go to one of the hotels in direct downtown Montreal. If you can handle the idea that for your stay, it would be like living in an apartment building, but with free food, and front desk help, then you could probably handle staying here. You have to remember, this is a RESIDENTIAL area, not the pristine streets of a metropolitan city. If you want shops, be really close to old Montreal, etc, then go to the downtown hotels. Have I made you understand what type of hotel this is? Like I said, it would be like living in an apartment in a residential area of Montreal. No fancy shwancy stuff. It is quiet, there are no problems there. Again, I want to prepare you that Montreal is not always clean looking, the graffiti, etc may turn you off as you start walking down to the main street, and which you may see at their Metro (train station), but other than that, Montreal is a busy, interesting place, with MANY places to eat. If you want some interesting nightlife, go to Crescent street. Montrealers love their patios, and this street is full of them, and is THE partying place at night, mostly Friday and Saturday. For a great breakfast, go to Burgers&amp;Benedicts (at the Pepsi Forum, just a couple blocks down). I had the 2 eggs with meat plate for $6.00, and it came on a big plate. Lots of bacon and grilled potatoes, etc. Very good food. Have a great time if you go, and make sure you visit old Montreal, it is fascinating with the architecture, cobbled streets, etc."
24,1595,"Jul 12 2006	Quiet but inconvenient location	I should first say that I don't travel much and have only stayed at a few hotels in the past. The reviews I read didn't seem too bad, and since this hotel is run by Marriott I decided to give it a try. I was going away for just the weekend so I wanted a nice, comfortable place to stay. My room was indeed comfortable, clean, and quiet and also spacious. I booked a one bedroom queen suite and there was a separate bedroom, living area including a dining table and desk, and kitchen. More than enough for just one person. This hotel is ideal for families and others who plan to stay in Montreal for over a week. I was so busy, I didn't even have time to use the kitchen, which was one of the main reason's I chose this hotel. If you are only going to stay in Montreal chose another hotel. Residence is on the very edge of downtown, and I was very disappointed to be so far from the action because I had hoped to walk to most places, but the only way to get to any attractions is by taking the Metro or a cab. Stay somewhere more centrally located. But I will say that there is a Metro station close by and the front desk staff are very friendly. Also, the room I stayed in, room 1703, though the balcony was closed for repairs, I had a great view of the mountain, so be sure to ask for a room on that side of the building."
25,1595,"Jul 10 2006	Somewhat Disappointed....	We stayed at the Residence Inn this past weekend and I can't say it was a miseralble time but I have stayed in much better hotels. This was a last minute trip and this hotel was right for the price and it had a small kitchen where we could make our own breakfast. The staff was super nice and friendly. My only problems with this hotel was that the parking garage was horrible. Too small and cramped and very expensive for what you have to go through to park. But better than getting a ticket for the residential area parking.I was really upset to see that on top of the 34+ dollars I was charged for the parking, I also had to pay for local calls!! I had no clue that calling a restaurant around the corner would cost me nearly $1.50. And we called several. Nice surprise when ready to check out! Overall the hotel was very clean and neat. I brought my own pots to cook in and the cleaning lady did not put them into the dishwasher, uuuuurrrrggggghhhh! But all of the other dishes that were in the sink were put in. Was also ticked that the hotel advertises that each room has a private balcony. You cannot go onto the balconies as there is construction going on. If you need someplace to stay on a whim, for not too much money, then this is your best bet but I am sure there are much better hotels in the area. Note: This hotel is really close to a university and thus the neighborhood is in not such a good condition. Seemed somewhat safe though."
26,1595,"Jun 26 2006	As bad as they say	We stayed there for a few days for a wedding. It is a good location near the old Forum. The hotel has lots of problems. The construction is one - first the garage is a mess. Bad to begin with, add the braces and it is awful.Union is on strike - hope you like a choice of contruction noise or union chants. The temporary housekeeping is not great. They left tthe door open on my parents room.We had a hotel room. Should have stayed in Old Montreal at the Springhill suites - and had a nice room.We had a cubby kitcken. That was fine. But no place to eat - we had a desk chair (and desk) and another chair but no table to eat at. Also, only 2 dresser drawers. When I asked they said that this type room did not have these things and it is a Residence Inn so no place to put suite cases. KInd of worse of all worlds. We stayed in Syracuse at the Courtyard and in Toronto in a Courtyard and they where much better. Marriott should get rid of this blemish on their reputation. I would never stay there again."
27,1595,"Mar 12 2006 	Not as bad as some describe (for me at least)	I can't say I was much impressed with this hotel. On the other hand I have little to complain about either.Something that will help you understand the previous reviews: this property used to be an apartment building. That explains why there are only 2 small elevators.The room I had used to be an apartment, so it had a large bedroom, a living room, and a kitchen. The price included a breakfast but it was pretty basic. I went the first 2 monrnigs and skipped it for the rest of my stay -- it's just not worth it.To be sure there are better hotels in Montreal, but this one is not all that bad."
28,1595,"Nov 16 2005	Disappointed Stay	I am a Silver Member and travel a lot during the year, i have stayed in different Marriott in Canada and USA, this is the worst one. Residence Inn Downtown (the one close to Peel metro station) is a lot better. We have reserved 2 rooms more than a month in advance and have requested close to each other , but when checked in the staff said the 2 rooms would be at different floors. Only after i repeated my request that they said there were 2 rooms next to each other, how come they did not arrange that in the first place! Then the breakfast room was crowded and there was a kitchen lady who was very rude. As the room was crowded, so we took food upstair but she questioned us in a very impolite manner. This ruin the start of the day. The a/c was very noisy and the lighting in living room was not sufficient. Have to wait the elevator for a long time, sometimes i have to use stair even i was at 8 floor. At check-out day no invoice was at our door at 7am, (but we have asked the front desk that we would got one at 5am on day of departure). There were errors on the invoice and the staff did not know how to fix it and asked us to wait til next shift to ask the day time staff. Would never stayed in this hotel in future."
29,1595,"Aug 27 2005	Don't stay at this hotel...very dissapointing for a Mariott	As a silver elite Mariott Rewards member I stay at Residence Inn properties very often. This one is not deserving of the Mariott name and is certainly nowehere near the standard of your typical Residence Inn. Quite frankly, it was a dump. I must say however that the front desk staff was very friendly but that is the only positive comment I can make. Here were the problems: noisy a/c, tiny room, insufficent elevators (waited 20 mins to get to our room), no ice machines except for the top floor and the ice tray in our freezer was empty, crumbling outside deck without any chairs, uncomfortable bed and linens, poor quality towels (2 of them were stained). I would never stay at this property again. If the Mariott folks ever review it themselves I'm confident they would dump this place. I still trust the Mariott name, but certainly not like I did before staying at this hotel. Do yourself a favour and stay elsewhere in beautiful Montreal."
30,1595,"Jul 28 2005	worst Residence Inn I have stayed at	I read some complimentary reviews but maybe those folks don't travel much or have kids and just want a place to crash and eat take -out pizza.Depends on what you are looking for, but I have stayed at some very good Residence Inns in the southern part of the US and outside Toronto. This was not one of them. The front desk was very nice and helpful-that I agree with. However, the room left a lot to be desired. Noisy A/C, shabby carpet and uncomfortable bed. Balcony outside looked like it was ready to crumble (no chairs even if we'd wanted to sit out). Think this was a reconverted apt bldg. My husband called it a &quot;dump&quot;.The elevator situation is horrible-constant waiting for 2 tiny elevators. Breakfast was a fiasco. They'd run out of lots of items and I got down there when they still had 45 min to serve. Very noisy and crowded. I grabbed 2 boxes of cereal and milk and took to our room. We ended up stopping for coffee and a muffin.And yes the area is kind of seedy-lots of students living in big old homes converted to apts. with probably cheap rent. We did walk back from central downtown at night and didn't have any problems though. There are quite a few depanneurs (little groceries) in the area. We were supposed to stay for 5 nts and checked out after 1 night ."
31,1595,"Jul 13 2005	Residence Inn comfortable but overpriced	For $198 CSD/night, we got a standard suite (queen bed, sitting area, kitchen) and a view of the water, plus breakfast in the morning. The bed was comfy and everything was functional but overall the room and bathroom appeared quite used...would have suggested a price closer to $120/night for the level of amenity.Good walking distance from St Catherines and tons of noodle houses (it's a student area)."
32,1595,"Jul 9 2005	Wonderful place!	Our family traveled from Florida to Montreal for a week (end of June - early July) and stayed at the Marriott Westmount. As a family of four, we travel on a budget, not luxury, so perhaps someone used to the Ritz would not be impressed - but we were! As other reviewers have mentioned, the included breakfast was wonderful, but somewhat crowded. The manager herself was helping to move things along by tending the waffle makers on Saturday morning. In the suite, our kitchen was fully equipped to make and serve dinner for four - something we have rarely found in places claiming to be 'suites' with kitchens - and the housekeeping services include washing the dishes! There is also a free grocery shopping service. We didn't use it, since we wanted to see what was available in the local grocery for ourselves, but on a long-term stay it would have been nice. We were in Canada during a heat wave - 90 degrees and humid - and our a/c kept up just fine.We thought the place was very clean, our housekeeping staff was great, and we had plenty of room when the sofabed was folded. The rooms and lobby really look just like the photos on the website, so there were no 'surprises.' For families like us, who do loads of laundry even on vacation, the laundry room was sparkling clean and pleasantly decorated, and the clothes were actually fully dry at the end of a cycle! Buy your detergent, etc at the grocery though - even if you only use half of it, it is cheaper than the $2 a load in the dispensers.The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. They had great advice about everything from where to get a pizza on Sunday night to the best viewing place for the Canada Day fireworks. Two things keep this from being an 'excellent' rating: the elevators and the location. There are only two small elevators in the building, which the staff and guests grumble about equally. Since we were on the 16th floor, stairs were not an option, and there was usually a very long wait. The location is not bad for getting around - we could walk or catch the Metro to anywhere we wanted - but it is not in one of the nicer neighborhoods. There were a lot of graffiti, weedy yards, and trash around that we did not see in some of the other more central neighborhoods. There were panhandlers and drunks on the streets in the evening - no trouble, but I wouldn't want to be walking alone. I guess people used to living in large cities wouldn't notice so much, but it was uncomfortable for us. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it and return there. It was a great value and very comfortable for family travel."
33,1595,"Jul 3 2005	DISAPPOINTED - SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE	$200 CAD for this suite hotel was a rip-off! I guess I can see why someone would consider this nce if they have never stayed in a suite hotel before or have had a bad experience in the past. I would only spend $100 CAD here. I have been a part of Tripadvisor for a while now but this is the first time I felt that I needed to speak out about this hotel so others are not mislead like I was.The picture gallery of all the picures I've found on the internet showed this hotel being really nice. Good thing about this hotel: nice lobby, free breakfast, free high speed internet if you have your own laptop. The parking is tight with columns dividing every space so you must be careful driving your car in. Good thing about parking is that there are elevators in the parking lot that goes straight up to your floor ONLY ON PARKING LEVELS 2 AND 5. The living room space is only the size of the sofabd. The linen is old, pillow case are washed but pilows are NOT and they smell. We open the balcony and there is water leaking from who knows where. If you have young children, becareful because there are spaces in the balcony---the walls of the balcony are not attached to each other. The washrooms are too tight for a suite and for the hallway, everyone can hear what you say in your suite! I've read on the internet that Old Montreal is about 30 mins walkign distance but the front desk says dont' walk it, take the subway because it is too far. So overall this hotel is not worth your money, go elsewhere ."
34,1595,"Jun 3 2005	It's not bad...	My husband and I traveled with a friend to Montreal and needed to find a suite with two separate rooms (hard to find in Montreal). So we found what we needed in this hotel. Two rooms, a shared bathroom, and a common area. The location was ok, near a Metro stop, convenience store, etc. The lobby was nice and modern. The staff was very helpful and the breakfasts were plentiful considering they were free. But the rooms themselves were bland and lifeless, the bare minimum, and not like what you would find at a Residence Inn in the states. So if you need the suites, go for it. But if you are traveling alone or with one other person, you might want to try to find something with more character."
35,1595,"Apr 19 2005	Decent Hotel Hospitable Good price	The four of us (two adults, two young children) stayed here for two nights in April 2005. In whole, it was an enjoyable experience. The hotel is very well located (right near the old Montreal forum and the Atwater metro, although about two Metro stops away from the major business and shopping attractions downtown) and we were able to find parking on the residential street where the hotel was situated. Be warned, however, that if you have an SUV or minivan and cannot find parking on the street, the hotel will direct you to a public parking lot about a block away as the hotel garage cannot accommodate any vehicle taller than 5 feet 6 inches. The lobby and breakfast area were trendier and more European by far than the Marriott Residences that we have stayed in the U.S. The breakfast was very good, with many healthy choices (and unhealthy ones too).The Penthouse pool was a little small, and the gym consisted of a number of treadmills and a few free weights. There is an excellent view from the penthouse floor where the gym and pool are located. The staff was very friendly and very hospitable. The price for the hotel was about $130.00 (Canadian) per night before tax, which included one master bedroom, a living room with a pull out couch, and full kitchen applicances. The hotel provided a nice crib for our under two year old with clean sheets, all put together for us, at no cost. The down side to this hotel is that the interior of the rooms seemed a little dingy, as do the floors where hotel rooms are located. The carpets look like they can use an upgrade and/or a good cleaning. However, the rooms themselves are kept clean, as are the sheets, towels, kitchen etc. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, however, to those looking for a romantic weekend away or for a sophisticated hotel experience, this is not the hotel you are looking for."
36,1595,"Feb 14 2005	Nice but not great	I have stayed here a few times. I was impressed by how fresh and hip the lobby and hallways were when I arrived, only to be somewaht underwhelmed by the rooms, which were previously apartments. The rooms were clean and fresh but were rather old and had undergone a &quot;soft&quot; renovation rather than a &quot;hard&quot; renovation prior to conversion into a hotel.  Parking under the hotel is handy, but limited overhead clearance is tough if you drive anything but a car. And, be sure to unload your bags on the street level, as it's a labyrinth of stairs getting the bags from the garage into the elevator.  The staff was friendly and accommodating and the breakfast above average."
37,1595,"Oct 14 2004	Nice not spectacular.	As other reviewers have said, nice but not spectacular. I spent one night here and it wasnot a bad choice. Rooms &amp; kitchens modern &amp;adequate if a little cramped. The 20th floor fitnesscenter &amp; pool were crisp ,clean &amp; enjoyable, as there is a great view from the outside terrase.The hotel is on a quiet, semi-residential street.Good access to Concordia, McGill &amp; la salleUNiversities. Lots of good takeout (or sitdown) restaruants. Plenty of small grocers (&quot;depanneurs&quot;) to fill your refrigerator. Double check if your room will havethe balcony promised. Staff is pretty friendly &amp;helpfull. Pretty good choice if you arestaying more than a few days &amp; are willing to walk a few blocks."
38,1595,"Sep 17 2004	Solid but dull.	Stayed here for 4 nights (Aug 04) and it is a solid suite based hotel. Upsides were 1) walkable to center of Montreal 2) balcony 3) friendly staff 4) breakfast was included 5) clean and presentable Downsides 1) no character whatsoever (realise it doesnt claim to have any) 2) no washer in room (was one in basement) and dated white goods 3) lift was incredibly slow and small (got the stairs more often that not) 3) breakfast was over subscribed as the opening times were too short 4) were next to the lift which while slow could be heard. Wouldnt stay here again, not because there is anything wrong with the hotel just because there is no reason to and Im sure your money could be better spent elsewhere."
39,1595,"May 11 2004	An excellent hotel	I stayed at the Residence in early May. It is a great hotel. The lobby, and public areas are very clean and appealing. The rooms are excellent, as well as the bathrooms. Even a kitchenette, if one desires to cook up something. An excellent buffet breakfast is included. The staff very nice and helpful. A huge shopping mall two blocks away, as well as a 22 screen movie complex, and a Metro stop. Could not have been a better place to stay for the price as far as I am concerned. Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed."
40,1595,"Mar 30 2004	thanks to Front desk staff	I just returned from a long stay in Montreal at Residence Inn Westmount. I did love the free grocery service provided with efficiency by the Front desk. I wish I could have the same at home. Room nicely decorated and comfortable. Not to mention the Lobby, very european. Breakfast is big and delicious. I do commend it."
41,1595,"Jan 6 2004	Nice Area But A Bit Removed	I spent three nights at the Residence Inn Marriott Mont Westmount (Jan 1-3). The hotel is situated on a nice quiet street (Lincoln) just below Sherbrooke. The room was okay but like many Montreal hotels is in need of renovations. I normally stay in the Latin Quartier or around Crescent St so being all the way down in the Atwater area was a bit inconvenient. The pluses are the AMC Forum is nearby so you can see great movies in a colossal theater and the Atwater Metro is right across from the Forum. The room had a great kitchen but the sleeping area needed sprucing up as did the bathroom but it was all clean. Also each room has a balcony. But the best part is the breakfast which is served daily and is included with your room rate. There were waffles, eggs, fruit, muffins, and numerous other items. Very economical. This hotel also charges a dollar for each outgoing call even local so that was a bit disconcerting but since I had made quite a few to friends, etc. Please note that all rooms that end in 6 or 7 are located right next to the elevator shaft so the constant droning can make you nuts. I was lucky that they had another room available on a lower floor which was much quieter. All in all not a bad place with a great staff and adequate rooms."

Stayed here for business travel - Friendly, helpful staff at front desk and restaurant. It was easy to get a good night's sleep because the bed/pillows are very comfortable and the rooms are quiet. Nice and clean with good location to freeways and subway station right next door. Decent pool and gym area for fitness.I am grateful for the helpful, honest and kind attitude of the hotel staff and management on how they handled my missing iPod. I reported it missing the day before I checked out and I concluded it must have happened during room cleaning, either taken or accidentally thrown out. The front desk management and, later, the hotel manager contacted me for more information and investigated the situation. They were understanding and empathetic about my loss and kind and generous in trying to recover and replace it. They said this was the first time for any kind of loss at this hotel."

We were referred by the Quebec Tourism (which is a great free service!!!), this hotel is rated as a 4 star and their review said &quot;within minutes of the Casino&quot;. Well let me tell you...a very roundabout confusing trip, a very lucky turn and 15 minutes later we found it, but this hotel SHOULD offer a shuttle service between themselves and the Casino! If I had known how hard it was to get to this hotel and the distance from the Casino I would have chosen another hotel. It took me 3 tries to find the right turn off, the right side road and the right driveway...and that was using a GPS unit!!! You can't be an inexperienced driver to manoeuvre your way around Montreal!I can say that it was clean, the people were friendly, the beds were comfortable (the best I slept in the whole trip!), and that is where it stops! There was no fridge, a TV (but you cannot plug a portable DVD player / or game system into), and private bathroom, but very outdated, no breakfast (but there is a McDonald's around the corner)."
4,1598,"Aug 9 2009 	great hotel and location	updated and clean rooms, great pool and gym, friendly service, subway at doorstep takes you anywhere in Montreal. would stay there again."
5,1598,"Jul 28 2009 	OK experience with some negatives but it was cheap	$84 for a night through Travelocity. The hotel seemed OK from the website and reviews so I thought I'd give it a try for an overnight stay in Montreal. The front desk experience was OK, although I was sure that the Travelocity reservation mentioned a complementary continental breakfast but the front desk person said that they didn't have one. The room itself was quite worn and my wife said that the carpet was dirty. The ice machine down the hall had its front hanging on by its hinges and the dispenser was held together by what looked like caulking (probably some sort of adhesive but it certainly wasn't done with care). The pool was OK and a decent size but shallow. When leaving in the morning, they had the entrance to the front of the hotel blocked off to cars for some unknown reason so I had to circle around and re-enter through the pay parking lot (but I didn't have to pay; it was just a pain). If I had paid $120, I would have been very unhappy. At $84, I was OK. If I could have given it a 2.5 rating instead of 3, I would have. Would I recommend it to a friend, though? Not likely, although if they were very frugal, I might."
6,1598,"Jun 30 2009 	Beware construction nearby.	Very disapointed, even though I didn't have high expectations, given the price point. Stayed there for 3 nights at the end of June 2009, with the family. While the location seemed convenient, being right next to the subway station and the free parking. But there is extensive construction going on nearby, which starts at 8am even on Saturdays. So if you've had some late nights out, don't plan on sleeping in too much. It woke us up even though we were on the 12th floor and had the AC working. From the looks of it the construction might take quite awhile. The service was good though, they gave us a room with 1king-bed by mistake, when we called they were able to change our room for a 2queen-beds right away. Also the hotel looked shabby from the outside, rooms and sheets smelled musty even though they we're clean. Probably from the lack of ventilation fan in the bathroom. Won't be staying there on next visit."
7,1598,"May 27 2009 	Disappointed	My husband and I were really disappointed with this hotel. When we were driving up to it we thought our GPS had lead us astray. It's not near anything of interest. We found the rooms to be a little shabby (there were floor tiles duct taped together in the lobby and an unfixed hole in the ceiling of our bathroom). Yes, the free parking was nice, and the Metro station couldn't be any closer, but we found the Metro to be somewhat of an inconvenience. The places we wanted to go to all required a transfer, which meant waiting for two separate trains and having to navigate through Montreal's huge Metro stations (they're like mini airports, seriously). Plus, for the two of us to ride the Metro to the city and back twice probably would have cost us the same as if we'd paid for parking somewhere in the city, and we would have wasted a lot less time."
8,1598,"May 27 2009 	good location	Chose this hotel due to location next to a metro station.Hotel was clean and tidy, reception was always very helpful, no safe deposit boxes in rooms, but more than happy to sort one out at reception. Swimming pool and gym both very quiet, small but functional.Best tip, get yourself to Reubens for a fantastic lunch (deli sarnies etc) fabulous value for money.Ate in the hotel first night due to long flight, pizza and beer were ok, but probably twice the price of outside, but that's not unusual in hotels.All in all a good hotel for our purposes."
9,1598,"Feb 27 2009 	Very nice accomodations next to a metro station	We were very pleased with our room on the 9th floor. It was winter, and the convenience of the Metro station right next door was a prime reason we stayed there. Leave the front door and enter the Metro station, and the city is only minutes away. Free parking is a major plus."
10,1598,"Dec 30 2008 	pleasant location	Near an amusement park.Not in the the center city of Montreal but a simple metro to Montreal.Enjoy the breakfast at Tim Horton's in the metro station.They speak english here.I had a double, it was good."
11,1598,"Dec 9 2008 	no so good  too far from the city	I didnt like this hotel at all , it was far from the city . our room wasnt clean and was smelly . stay away!!"
12,1598,"Oct 14 2008 	Terrific place to stay	Everything about the Sandman was wonderful-clean, spacious rooms. Staff extremely helpful and reception desk English-speaking. Location next to metro station very convenient. (We never drove our car for the 3 days were were there.) We would recommend this hotel to anyone-great value for the money."
13,1598,"Sep 30 2008	Nice modern hote excellent rooms not the best location	This is a modern hotel, with good facilities- swiming pool, quality restuarant, and bar. Restaurant has above average price, service not great, but set meal worth trying. The rooms are above average size, clean and comfortable. The only let down is the location, it is a few subway stops out of the centre. We were with a tour group and got back from sight seeing very late most nights, which meant we either had to eat in the restuarant or get on the subway to find food, as there is only fast food available nearby. But if location is not an issue for you, then I would recommend this for the price."
14,1598,Sep 22 2008 	Sandman was great!	We went to Montreal for my boyfriends birthday and had a great experience at the Sandman. It's a beautiful hotel that is clean and convenient. A little less expensive than right in the city which was great! It was convenient having the subway right next door.
15,1598,"Sep 3 2008 	Great Value	We stayed in a Queen room (2 queens, tv, bathroom, no fridge) for $87 a night ($100 with tax) off of a web deal on expedia.The front desk was very helpful, and kind, printing out directions to anywhere we needed to go, and routing us through the subway system. It's a toss up - we stayed there b/c it was cheap, had free parking, and was rated high on tripadvisor (meaning it was clean, service was good, and there weren't any glaring objections to it. It even has a pool and gym). It was outside of the city though.To tell you the truth, many attractions were easier to get to by car, so it's not such a big deal in terms of getting to places, and with that you have the subway nextdoor. But you're not in the heart of the city at all, if that's important to you (please see the price we paid above to determine if it's important to you).The place was a steal for the price, for what it offered. It's a good hotel, yeah a little old, and not so so pretty on the outside, but absolutely fine on the inside and the amenitites were fine (as opposed to glamorous).Stay here if you're looking for comfort on a budget, and you don't mind being 15 min. from the city, and taking a subway (or as I call it, a language barrier)."
16,1598,"Aug 26 2008 	Good value	We found the Sandman to be a good value. The averaged-sized rooms are clean, but nothing to get excited about - just two beds, a standard bathroom, a fridge, and a desk. The pool was quite nice, and the exercise room was sufficient to get in a weightlifting and aerobic workout. The front desk and dining room staffs were very pleasant. The Sandman is somewhat in the middle of nowhere, but a subway entrance is right next door, making it easy to get into Montreal."
17,1598,Aug 12 2008 	Great hotel!	Stayed here with a large tour group. We were here the night of Canada day so we caught a train(right next door) to town to watch the celebrations and back again. The room was nice and clean and very big.Staff were friendly and it is easy to get around!
18,1598,"Jul 14 2008 	Great budget hotel for families	This was our 2nd stay and again it was good. The first time we found the level of the noise coming from the highway too high, so this time we requested a room on the metro side. Unfortunately, it was still noisy. We could hear other guests coming in and out of their room and the beep of the elevator.Overall, it is nice, a little old, but clean. I recommend it to families you want to visit Montral. The pool is CROWDED but nice."
19,1598,Jul 10 2008 	Good Hotel	Had an good stay when we visited Montreal in the long weekend. Very close to downtown and La Ronde.Washrooms did not have fan in there which make them stink all the time. The worst thing was that they have placed the coffee maker in the washroom.
20,1598,"Jul 9 2008 	Good value reasonable location	We asked for the CAA rate and stayed for $105 a night, a good rate for this hotel in July. This hotel is outside Montreal, but the metro station is immediately below the hotel which makes it an attractive place to stay outside the more expensive Montreal core area. The one factor to consider is the closing time for the metro and whether you will need to stay downtown Montreal past that time.Driving to the hotel location was relatively easy, as it is close to the Jacques-Cartier BridgeThe standard hotel room was clean, everything was in working order. We did not have any problem with our stay other than one burned out lamp. The ice machine on our floor was out of order, but everything else we encountered was fine. Average to above average hotel."
21,1598,"Jun 14 2008 	Sandman was superb!	Having read the reviews we decided on Sandman for our 4 night stay to visit Canadian Grand Prix. While these reviews accurately described the absolute comfort and cleanliness of the rooms and quality and variety of the meals, we were most pleasantly surprised with the nearness to the Metro Station for mainly access to all of Montreal by Metro but also quality of shops within the Metro station, especially the grocery shop where we could have quite happily bought 1st class food items from chill cabinet and lovely beers and wines from shelves and chillers. We spoke to other holidaymakers staying in downtown Montreal who were having problems with noise etc...we had none of this, plus we had views of the island and river, an excellent location which we could honestly recommend to everyone!"
22,1598,"May 27 2008 	Excellent overall value	We just spent a week's vacation in Montreal and were really glad we chose the Sandman. It's right across the street from the Longueuil Metro station, putting you only 2 stops away from the center of town. If you stay out after the Metro shuts down, the hotel is right over the river from Montreal, so the cab ride prices were reasonable.  The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and fluent in English. The room was clean and comfortable, but the beds may be a bit hard for some. When the bathroom light went out, maintenance was there within 15 min to fix it. The indoor pool was clean but shallow. There is a small fitness area with weight machines, 2 treadmills and 1 stationary bike.Overall, we were very pleased and will stay there again."
23,1598,"May 26 2008 	Excellent Hotel good value and close to Metro.	Excellent Hotel. Everything we wanted. Very clean, tidy, nice Bar, Restaurant area (had a nice breakfast buffet), good indoor Swimming Pool, Carpark (free) and well situated for the Tube to Montreal's city centre. We booked our room on the Internet, a few weeks earlier, with no problems. We flew in from England (UK) to Boston and drove over the USA/Canada border to Montreal. As we drove into Longueuil we had problems finding this Hotel. Perhaps we were getting tired after such a long journey or the map from The Sandman's Web Page was lacking detail, a bit of both I suspect, as we got lost a number of times in the surrounding Hotel's area. So if you're a lousy driver like us, get plenty of Maps of the area printed off first. This is just a minor moan/detail and hope it does not detract from the splendid Hotel. On arrival we were greeted by very friendly and helpful Reception Staff. The one Lady even helped me make an international phone call home to England using their public phones in the reception area. I failed miserably with all the Codes and Language barrier, but she took the time to sort out this problem and my connection was made. I've stayed at other Hotels and asked for similar help and they will not get involved....so, well done that lady! The Sandman Hotel was a good choice and would use (and recommend) this Hotel again on our next visit to Montreal."
24,1598,"Apr 10 2008 	Unbeatable Value!	Excellent location directly next door to Metro station. A quick 10-minute train ride to downtown. Free parking for hotel guests and accessibility to transit across the street made for easy travels all over Montreal downtown.Apart from the location, this hotel has AMAZING value! It might not be downtown, but it is quick and easy and almost half the price! We paid $100 CAD a night and similar 3.5 star hotels downtown were charging upwards of $160. Indoor pool and hot tub were great and breakfast buffet (although very busy) offers a great selection and price. Front desk staff helpful and courteous. Will return anytime!!"
25,1598,"Mar 9 2008 	Nice 3 star	We had a one-night stay, en-route to the States. The Staff at Reception are most helpful &amp; friendly. The hotel is clean. Rooms &amp; bathrooms adequate. Beds comfortable. Nice &amp; quiet on the Sunday night that we stayed. The pool &amp; sauna we had to ourselves on Monday morning. Location is excellent proximity to major highways. We would definitely consider Sandman Longueuil for a stop-over again. Excellent value for the money...we had booked on-line with Sandman's own web-page for $85 prepaid a couple of weeks in advance. Parking was free."
26,1598,"Jan 20 2008 	Nice hotel	I stayed three nights in Sandman-Longueuil. The rooms are nice and clean, there was a telephone and an RJ-45 plug for internet access in my room. The heater / air conditioner is a little bit too loud and starts and stops automatically. It is hard to adjust temperature, it does not maintain a set temperature very well, but otherwise the location is good and the price is very reasonable. Staff is friendly, corridors are clean, not too many people and it was pretty quiet. The best part about this hotel is that it is within 3 minutes walking distance to &quot;Longueuil&quot; Metro station. There isn't too many dining places within walking distance, though. There is free parking outside, which is nice, but no lunch was included in price. The bathroom is pretty clean, water is hot. It takes about 20 minutes to reach Downtown Montreal from this hotel, so I can say, it is conveniently located, even though it is on the other side of the river. It is pretty safe there, I believe, doors are good and are opened by magnetic swipe-cards. I definitely recommend this hotel, although it is not extremely romantic...."
27,1598,"Dec 31 2007 	Great Place to Stay!	I go to Montreal quite a bit with friends for long weekends. I have stayed in many hotels down town and have stayed a the Sandman 3-4 times. Overall, I think the sandman is the best value and place to stay. Many of the hotels right in the city are double the price and not as clean. The Sandman is very clean is is located right outside of a metro stop. We usually take the Metro into town for a night out and then get a taxi back to the hotel. The taxi usually costs about $20 canadian dollars. Even when I stay right in the city I end up taking a taxi at night so it is not that big of a deal. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Montreal!"
28,1598,"Dec 19 2007 	You Have to Consider this Hotel for your Montreal stay	This October, as the leaves are changing color in beautiful Montreal and Quebec, I stayed at this hotel for the second time...and I will keep coming back. (This was my 7th time in Montreal).The most compelling reason to stay here is the exceptional location that, while not in the Montreal city limits, is IMMEDIATELY across the important Jacques Cartier Bridge so Montreal is 5 minutes away by car or, if you want to use the Metro, the terminus on the &quot;South Shore&quot; is across the parking lot from the hotel and it will also have you at the main &quot;Berri-UQAM&quot; stop in 5 minutes.There are other reasons as well. This used to be a Radisson property so the standards are high in terms of creature comforts. Because it is in Longueuil, on the &quot;South Shore,&quot; the prices are much more competitive. The rooms are super comfortable with a sitting area adjacent to the floor-to-ceiling windows. From my sofa, I was able to sit, read the paper and look at the Jacques Cartier Bridge with Montreal's skyline behind it. The staff has real &quot;joie de vivre,&quot; that Quebecois exuberance that was so incredibly pleasant, exemplified by each staff member and in both visits. They were extremely enthusiastic about helping me and making sure I was satisfied with my requests or questions.Other bonuses: a free of charge business area and free parking for guests (try finding that in Centre-Ville Montreal !)...I did not partake in the food offerings as there was no breakfast included, but at $ 105 CDN, I can't complain given that I received 4-star accommodations. Also, the gym and pool always seemed so lonely that I chose not to use them and go to places in the area that were better attended.This hotel might be overlooked because it doesn't come up under Montreal or is under a special heading. I am a good sleuth and found it by seeing the Radisson sign (when it was a Radisson) next to the Metro Terminus complex as I was crossing the Jacques Cartier Bridge in my rental car several years back. I'm glad I took notice. I recommend it."
29,1598,"Oct 1 2007 	Sandman was great	I loved our stay at the Sandman. We would definitely stay again. Very friendly and helpful staff. Just mention that you would like internet and they give you a cable modem free of charge.The metro was very convenient and made everything very close. It was a little tricky getting from the airport to the metro. If you take a cab it will be expensive, the bus will work but make sure you get directions from someone, we used the info phone in the airport to get directions. Here is a very good write up on how to use the bus to get to the metro:[--]"
30,1598,Aug 21 2007	good value	excellent location - right next to metro station. very clean room. and we had a great view of Montreal from 17th floor room.
31,1598,"Aug 9 2007	Not impressed at all	Had an OK stay when we visited Montreal in the long weekend. Beddings were quite old. Washrooms did not have fan in there which make them stink all the time. The worst thing was that they have placed the coffee maker in the washroom. I will never stay in this hotel again. They say its 4 star but according to my experience, it barely makes upto 2 star. Had MUCH pleasant stay ay Novotel Aeroport."
32,1598,"Jul 13 2007	All you could ask for	Clean, average sized room. Clean pool and workout room. Internet access worked but was a bit weak. Very friendly and helpful staff. Book through Expedia and it will be cheaper than going through the hotel."
33,1598,"Jun 20 2007 	Above Average	Every year we stay at this hotel. I just found out about tripadvisor not all that long ago, so I decided to post a review this year. If you are going to Canada for Grand Prix weekend this hotel is excellent. The metro station is right outside of this hotel which makes it very conveinent. The staff is wonderful. They are always smiling and always helpful. The pool is a decent size and there is a nice sitting area outside of the pool. Grand Prix weekend the breakfast buffet is included in the cost and the food is GREAT! My fiance just loves it. It is one of his favorite parts of our stay there. The rooms are a decent size. They have king beds, sofas, beautiful views, nice tv's, ironing boards, hair dryers, closets, and even a mini fridge. We love this place."
34,1598,"Mar 22 2007 	It is a roof-over-your-head....	I will start with a good point... The hotel is nowhere near downtown, but it is directly beside the Metro. The Metro is very easy to use thank goodness, because a taxi ride from downtown to the hotel is approximately $20 CAD.The beds and bedding are not the finest, our tap in the washroom would not turn off unless you wriggled it and turned it upside down... The air conditioner near the window, when on, would blow at your head when sitting at the desk... helpful if you have forgotten your hairdryer...I was sharing 2 connecting rooms with my family (total of 7 of us), and there were no fans in the washrooms... yes, I can't believe there were no fans to whisk away the humidity of the shower, and other things which I will not write about... (i thought fans in washrooms were some sort of standard? maybe I am wrong) but I ended up fanning the room using our door to the hallway...The lighting in the washrooms made me look like a zombie, and there were many many problems with getting the in-room internet to work properly... some of my friends on the 8th floor couln't get theirs to work at all and had to use the business lounge near the lobby... And as for the elevators... They were so PAINFULLY slow that I ended up getting frustrated each and every time, and I just took the stairs instead, high-heeled-shoes or no...The ONLY redeeming quality were the 2 or 3 young and friendly staff. One young gentleman took it upon himself to seek out the only corkscrew in the whole hotel, which I think was kept in a safe somewhere... and he finally did find it, and helped me to open my bottle of wine that I could drown my miseries in...To me, this hotel was a roof-over-my-head, and lived up to it's 3-star rating. When returning to Montreal I will try a downtown location and hope for the best..."
35,1598,"Oct 17 2006 	Excellant Choice	This Hotel was excellent. From the minute we walked in the door, the bi-linguel staff could not help us enough. This is the first Hotel we have stayed in on this trip that has not had free internet in the room, but I would say that this is the best hotel we have stayed in so far, half way thru our 21 day tour. The room was well presented and clean, the desk staff were very helpful when asked the routine &quot;tourist&quot; questions, the restaurant staff were very pleasant and the food was excellent. The hotel is located accross the road from a subway station making the location very convenient as you can be in the centre of town in a few minutes. The internet is available in a business centre where you can use their computer or connect your own. Public phones are available in the foyer if you wish to avoid the $1.00 surcharge for all phone calls made from the room. The only bad point is the road noise that you can hear from the freeway and we were on the 16th level, but it certainly was not loud enough to bother us at night. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to anyone."
36,1598,Oct 12 2006 	good buy	We stayed there for two nights and it was nice especially the the price we got online. Location is good you might take metro to go almost everywhere in town. The metro station is just across the road and actually the hotel parking lot is the metro parking!
37,1598,"Oct 11 2006 	Superb Sandman	Some bad reviews state &quot; i did not know they spoke french?&quot; Like me you should know montreal is populated mostly by french canadians, whom are very friendly and courteous. The Sandman Longueuil is a fantastic hotel, the room was spacious and modern. we was on the 12th Floor overlooking the st lawrence river &amp; olympic tower in Montreal. The only criticism I have about our room is that they did not provide us with any spoons to stir coffee/tea - all we had was plastic sticks ! The Hotel was literally next door to the metro station which was only 1 stop away from Montreal centre, now that's convienient ! I Parking is free at the Hotel and easy to get to from any direction on the interstate. I would definately stay here again."
38,1598,"Oct 11 2006 	Average Hotel but Good Price	Got a great price from Expedia for a three night stay however visitors should be aware that this is primarily a business hotel and also used by large coach parties.The Sandman is classed as a four star according to the name plate outside however I would definately put this as a three star for rooms and facilites which are bog standard Novotel style rooms which need updating. The staff however were cheerful and helpful.If I visited Montreal again I would definately pay a little extra to stay in the Old Town as the suburb of Longueuil, where the hotel is situated, is on the end of a branch line of the Metro so you have to travel to a hub station before going anywhere within the main city - saying that the Metro was clean and efficient."
39,1598,"Oct 5 2006 	Great stay at the Sandman	After a horrible day of driving and the realization that the attraction we had just driven six hours to visit [the nearby La Ronde amusement park] was CLOSED due to poor weather, we checked into the Sandman ready for some drying off and sleeping.The hotel has a great location, as has been pointed out in previous reviews. A METRO subway station is right outside, leading to downtown Montreal. Parking is free, as well, so the cost to get downtown is minimal. The proximity to La Ronde can't be beat, it's less than a five minute drive from La Ronde and Parc Jean Drapeau.We paid under $90 Canadian per night in late August, easily the cheapest three-star location that I came across in my searches. Location to restaurants leaves a bit to be desired [a large strip of restaurants is about a ten minute drive away], however the hotel does feature an in-house restaurant and bar, which we did not dine at. Prices are very high, however.Room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly. I'd definately recommend this location to anyone."
40,1598,"Oct 4 2006 	very helpful staff	Our first time to Montreal, and the staff couldn't have been more helful. Booked our tours, explained the metro, and gave excellent recommendations for good, reasonable restaurants. The Metro is right beside the hotel and very convenient. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel's restaurant.Had a very good dinner there late on a Saturday night.The hotel is maintained well. Only complaint; they could stock more English language papers in the lobby. Would use this hotel again."
41,1598,"Aug 30 2006 	Best value after all	My wife and I stayed there two nights in mid August, during a road trip USA-Canada-USA. I reserved my room in July through the hotel's website and catched a special offer at 99 CDN per night plus taxes. As far as I can remember, the offer also included the breakfast, however the confirmation e-mail just mentioned &quot;hot deal&quot; in the conditions. When we arrived at the hotel, we were assigned a spacious and clean double-bed room as expected, but we were told that the breakfast was excluded from the rate. When I tried to check back the website, some days after, the offer was no longer present on the website.Despite this inconvenience and the need fot some external renovations, I must award this hotel with the best price/quality ratio of all hotels we visited during our trip to Boston, Ottawa, Toronto, Niagara Falls, Geneva and New York.We were able to keep our car in the (complimentary) parking lot during all our stay and move with the subway, which is literally on the other side of the road and offers connections to the city centre and the &quot;Plateau&quot; neighborhood. We just used the car to visit Mont Royal and the Olympic Stadium.I would definitely recommend this hotel, unless you want to stay to a location very close to the city centre."
42,1598,Aug 27 2006 	not impressed	First of all be awere that Montreal is a mostly French spoken city.The Hotel we stayed at charged us $18CA for internett access. We stayed at 3 other Sandmans and it was free. Room does not have a fridge and is in need of a revamp. Bathroom was tiny could not close the door and use the toilet. The train station near by only had stairs and carrying cases made it very difficult
43,1598,"Aug 27 2006 	Great hotel	Stayed for 3 nights with 2 teenagers. Metro right next door (2 stops to Old Montreal). Comfortable, clean good sized rooms with great views - excellent price through expedia. Lovely, good sized pool and gym area. Very friendly, helpful staff. Free carpark. Great base to see Montreal."
44,1598,"Aug 22 2006 	A Solid and Affordable Hotel	My wife and I both agree that the Sandman is a great hotel for anyone who wants a decent hotel at a decent price, nearby Montreal.The staff was friendly. The hotel stuck by our reservation with no surprises. They bumped us up to a king sized room on arrival, instead of two queens. This gave us a comfy couch, coffe table, and plush chair to enjoy the view out the window. Our room was spotless. The bathroom was extremely clean with much room.It only takes you thirty seconds to walk from the hotel to the metro. In the metro building are some stores, fast food restaurants, and a small grocery story.Our only dissapointment was the breakfast buffet. Though it included pancakes, bacon, breads, cereal, and fruit - it seemed rather bland and not worth the money. If you can wait, go elsewhere for breakfast. Be warned, there are not many choices within the hotel vicinity to dine. Part of enjoying Montreal is choosing where you are going to eat. Hop on the metro, and within 15 minutes you can start your adventure."
45,1598,"Aug 19 2006	Good hotel GREAT VIEW - good value for money	Your standard room, King with a fold out couch. GREAT VIEW of Montreal. 100ft from the metro. Used metro and left car in lot. Parking was free. My son enjoyed the pool and exercise room. Very handy, McD's in the train station, and a grocery shop with sandwiches and the like. Stayed 2 nights, would use again."
46,1598,"Aug 8 2006	Great place for the money	This hotel was comfortable - just steps from the subway - easy to get in and out of the city. Taxi costs about $40 to the airport from the Sandman. Staff was friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 16th floor with a view of Montreal. They have a pool and fitness room. They have free internet access available, a place to eat, also close to McCafe for those requiring that type of thing. All in all, I'd stay there again."

1,1607,Oct 26 2009 	Dont bother!	We paid for the best room ! - The electricity was constantly going off for long periods. OK this may be part of the Indian way but why advertise it as 24/7 electricity. Even when the electricity was on the shower NEVER worked - not good for the price of the room!!it was dirty and grubbyThe staff were unfriendly and rude.The only decent person there was in the roof top restaurant - he was a really nice chapDont go there - spend your money elsewhere!!
2,1607,"Aug 26 2009 	Great value place for backpackers	A great place to stay for backpackers and those travelling on a budget- probably one of the more decent choices in the area as the adjacent hotels we had seen were disgusting. We paid 700 INR a night for a double room which was clean with a/c, hot water, and even a plasma screen tv! Great value for money. The hotel had a relaxed communal area with pool tables, a German bakery and cheap internet/ wifi service. The only thing I didn't like was the food service in which I found the staff quite slack and the orders took ages to arrive.The location is fine if you want to be part of the hustle and bustle (the hotel is surrounded by local bazaars), but if not it can be quite chaotic. Generally, Ajay Guest House offers good budget accomodation and I would definately return there again."
3,1607,Jun 13 2009 	basic accomodation - Good area	We have stayed at Ajay's 2 times and would stay there again.It is basic accomodation in the busy Paharganj area.The rooms can be a bit gloomy and typical indian bedding ( thin mattreses) but you get what you pay for.The bathrooms do have a western toilet and hot and cold water which is another bonus.They also have cheap internet on site and a travel desk to book tours and change money. The restaurant down stairs is alway busy and has nice toasted sandwiches and cakes they call it the german bakery.If you want to stay in the paharganj area then this is in the middle of the hustle and bustle and is ok for the price ( the prices have gone up since i stayed there last).
4,1607,"Feb 27 2009 	Terrible Terrible Terrible	We had made a reservation via e-mail based on recommendations in a guide book. Our reservation and price were confirmed as were our travel arrangements. However, when we arrived after an overnight train, we were told the only room available was double the price we agreed. The staff were rude, aggressive, totally unwilling to explain to us why the reservation had not been held. They accused us of not having made a reservation and then when we could prove we had, they then told us we were too late arriving, 90 mins after our train was due to arrive at a station 40 mins away, even though they had our train details. The room we were offered did appear clean, however, it was the appalling manner in which we were treated which left a lasting impression. If you are staying here, confirm, re confirm, print your e-mails from them and have a back up plan."
5,1607,"Jan 15 2009 	Everything a backpacker guest house should be and more!	I have regularly stayed at the Ajay hotel over the past 10 years, mostly in the budget rooms (basic: room, bed, bathroom - that's it). This most recent visit, I stayed in one of their refurbished rooms on the third floor and I was most impressed. 600 INR per night for a good sized, immaculate AC double room (with sheets and blankets), with wide screen TV, cable and en suite bathroom.As well as an excellent location, what i like about the Ajay is that it provides everything the India backpacker could want - lots of communual meeting/hang out areas (roof top cafe, seating areas on each floor, a bakery/cafe, pool table and internet cafe - and all at a budget price for those trying to stretch their pennies as far as they will go.On the downside, few of the rooms have a window, which can be disorientating if your body clock demands daylight to know what time of day or night it is, and the large open design of the building means that noise travels rather too well within the building. Use ear plugs. On the plus side, tucked up a little side street off the main Parharganj market road, it misses much of the street noise. Overall, the Ajay is an excellent and dependable budget hotel by Indian standards and I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful (actually, about 10 years ago, I got a bit of a bollocking from the manager for not locking my room properly one time, but that is a different story - it did show me that he took security seriously) and is a safe and secure place in the &quot;downtown&quot; part of New Delhi."
6,1607,Nov 7 2008	Terrible place!!!	I found address in internet and contact with them. They replied so I deside to stay there. Thanks for God I pay only for one night! That place is horrible! And absolutely agree with other comments!
7,1607,"Apr 11 2007	Horrible place to stay	This was my first visit to Delhi, and I have to say i was really horrified by this guesthouse. I'd already been travelling for 4 months and i dont think my standards are particularly high. It put the grubbiest of my student flats to shame! I arrived at about 3am, so was tired after a long flight and was picked up(arrnaged through guesthouse) in a small van which didnt start, we had to get pushed several times by strangers in the street! The room i got was tiny, like a prison cell. The white walls were covered in dirty grimy marks and dead insect stains.The bed was old and though i think the sheets were relatively clean, the place had a grimy dirty feel to it. The bathroom was disgusting, old, falling apart and felt dirty. I also had the nasty experience of someone waking me up at about 3am the next night knocking on my door. I said hello a few times but no one answered me and i could hear feet shuffling outside.I didnt open the door as im a lone female traveller but it made me very scarred. Thankfully i had bolted the door. Needless to say i left after one night."
8,1607,"Dec 18 2006 	Grubby and unfriendly	My husband and I have just spent 2 nights at Ajays. It's not at all like the guide books say. The bathroom was filthy, the sheets were stained, there were men lurking on each floor. The staff were unhelpful and unfriendly. We asked for the bathroom to be cleaned as it was so filthy it obviously hadn't been cleaned in months, they didn't clean it. We won't be going back. On the plus side you do get cable TV which is a good distraction from the dirtyness!"
9,1607,"Apr 10 2006	Who likes sticky beds?	It may be recommended by many guide books, but frankly speeking, I found the Ajay Guest House in Pahar Ganj (the Main Bazaar) really horrible. Our room was dirty, the bed was sticky - I don't know whether the bedlinnen was cleaned at all, but they should definitely changer their washing powder, if yes. Staff wasn't helpful, either, and they overcharged on the airport pick-up (450 Rs instead of 300 Rs at the prepaid booth). It might be cheap for Delhi (ca 500 Rs for a double room) but in my opinion, it's not worth even that. There are better places at the same rate around.Ajay Guest House, Delhi, India, Paharganj, 5084 Main Bazaar Tl : --- Email : ---"

1,1614,"Mar 20 2009 	Not worth the money spend	External appearance is great. The employees dress like professionals. But it is only in their dress and salutations! All employees accept great tips. But service is really poor. I stayed in one room. There was heavy construction noise very nearby. Also there was block in bathroom sewage. Reported the trouble. They changed me to another room. Room was clean. But again not so good bath room and toilet (for the amount they charge). In the bathroom ventilator of this new room there was bird's nest and the birds were making noises. Looking out of the 4th floor room window, the view is in to the yard of a small house. You can enjoy everything happening in that house. Internet connectivity from your room: They charge you almost 15% of your room rent for internet connection for a full day and the connection is very poor. You cannot do any serious work with their connection. I stayed only for two days even though I was in Delhi for more than five days. The third day early in the morning itself I moved to another better hotel."
2,1614,"Feb 21 2009 	Hotel wasn't bad but not in the best location	We stummbled upon this hotel accidently, were originally stayed at Raj Hans down the road...but it was soooo disgusting we paid double to stay at the Atrium the next night...our last night in India. so after staying in the crappiest 5 star ever the nite before the Atrium was definetly an upgrade...but it felt empty . We got there late ..about 11pm and were going to check out at 9 that morning so they lowered the rate for us. The location of this hotel sucks, the area is unlit at night...desserted....so for a first time traveller it made me uneasy...it was basically in the middle developing hotels...construction surrounds it...I think they are trying to build a community of resorts. The room was small but nice, modern. We ordered room service, it wasnt bad. Room was clean but there was a door joining our room with another and we could hear the people next door clearly...the walls are paper thin. I dont think I would stay there again but it was nice enough....we never did see any other guests,"
3,1614,"Nov 21 2007 	Terrible Hotel Terrible location	We had the misfortune to be allocated to this hotel by a tour operator.We were told we would be staying in a four star hotel in Old Delhi. However it transpired that we were instead booked into this hotel which is 25k from Delhi in another town altogether, Faridabad, an unattractive industrial area.Our first impressions of the hotel were of a massive construction site spewing dust onto a building with peeling paint and dirty windows. The room was the worst we stayed in throughout our two week stay in India. It was dirty, the electrical sockets were not attached properly to the wall, the sheets were stained and had holes and for the first 24 hours we had no hot water. The construction site began at around six am and made noise which was loud enough to wake us through a closed window.The hotel is arranged into four atriums which are massive and deserted. It seemed that our tour group and handful of others were the only people staying in hotel which had a capacity for at least ten times that amount. The service was not remarkable but a little lax. A room service tray which was outside our room when we arrived had not been removed when we left nearly 48 hours later, despite various staff coming to our and the adjacent room during the period.It took between 40 and 90 minutes to get in and out of the centre of Delhi depending on traffic and therefore it was not a practical choice for sightseeing in the city.I would not recommend that anyone stay at this hotel."
4,1614,"Jul 5 2007 	Horrible intrusive service at the Atrium	I had the misfortune to spend around 10 days at the Atrium hotel while travelling on business. Really it was quite disappointing from start to finish. I was given a room with a tiny window in a corner, facing out onto an active construction site that was active almost around the clock. Besides the noise, construction workers could look right into the room as soon as a the curtains were open which left me without natural light most of the time. When I got to the room the shower didn't work, and it took them ages to fix, the toilet seat was broken, there was hair on the bedsheets, the carpets in the room were filthy and other small details in the room, glasses etc, were just not clean. I was never offered a new room.The service ranged from being, in the best case, just very awkward, to in the worst case being extremely intrusive. In general it was always bad. After a very disappointing meal in the restaurant I pointed out that the bill was incorrect (in my favour). Two times I was assured that it was fine. Two hours later I was called up in my room by someone who refused to speak english but managed to communicate that I needed to sign my bill. After a while he said he would come to my room. It was almost midnight and I had already gone to bed so I said absolutely not. Minutes later, despite my refusal, the person knocked on the door, barged in and forced me to sign a new restaurant bill to correct the mistake made hours ago. The difference was just a few rupies.Laundry was returned at almost 11pm and was always incorrectly handled despite clear instructions.I can't believe this hotel manages to market itself as international standard accomodation as it is so far below what can reasonably be expected that it is just not worth it at any price."
5,1614,"May 9 2007 	Good hotel excellent service	We stayed at the Atrium for three nights in April.The service from check-in to check-out was excellent; all staff were helpful and friendly.The entrance is grand, the communal areas are well decorated, and the rooms are comfortable. Power can be erratic at times, but this is to be expected in Delhi.You will need transport if staying at this hotel, as it is a little out of town.All in all a nice hotel, and I would stay here again."
1,1615,Nov 25 2009	Amazing!	what can i say... drive through the area it is situated in and you are thinking the worst.. but turn the corner and the Avalon comes out of nowhere! Fantastically designed hotel with great rooms and good food! Gym and pool is always a nice addition which the avalon certainly does not lack. Only one quarm i can think of and that was the shower door not fitting properly leading to a large puddle of water on the bathroom floor. Apart from that... Amazing.
2,1615,"Oct 3 2009	Claustrophobic and No-maza	The approach road to Avalon appears unfriendly and dilapidated. I don't think you want to take a stroll around the hotel. Inside the courtyard the rooms are trendy and has a mini kitchenette. The long french windows lead into nothing ... err a completely covered space. No fun. We used the place to grab a night's sleep as we kept ourselves busy with NewDelhi during day times. The courtyard boasts of a heated indoor pool, but the heating system wasn't functioning during our stay. Breakfast spread is ok."
3,1615,"Aug 31 2009 	Modern and pleasant but totally out of the way!	The Avalon was a pleasure to walk into - bright and spacious reception with modern decor. Very clean and pleasant check in procedure. Lovely double room - almost a suite, very well equipped with TV, sofa, comfy bed with clean and fresh bedding. Staff were friendly and attentive when required.Downside is the location....we booked this through an agent and so did not realise the location otherwise would not have stayed here. If you want to wander into town (Delhi), this is the wrong place to stay. If you want to stay in a quieter hotel in a residential area then this might be for you."
4,1615,"Jul 29 2009 	Awful Location dry (alcohol) hotel drivers with scams for money but lovely rooms.	Fortunately, the only savior with this hotel is the rooms are completely fantastic. We arrived in the evening and found our room entirely lovely. However on the following morning we booked a car through the hotel, only to be scammed by the 'guide'. The staff are entirely lovely and the restaurant is decent. IF YOU DRINK THIS IS NOT YOUR HOTEL, as this district of dehli is completely dry. Also you must keep in mind that if you travel outside of this hotel you may need to pay a tax to get entry back into the district (your taxi will not pay this fee). It is also far from the sights and city center so be prepared to pay around 700Rs for 40m or 4 hours and then fees above if doing any sightseeing. We probably would NOT go back because of location and proximity to anything in Dehli worth seeing."
5,1615,"Jul 28 2009 	Ultra modern clean and very friendly	I stayed in one of the Residence suits which was lovely - spacious, well equipped with kitchen, large bathroom, sofa, TV and very comfortable bed.The staff were delightful, really friendly and helpful.The spa was very nice and all facilities were included in the room priceInternet was super fast but expensive at 500RS for 2 hoursBreakfast was also delicious.It took just 30 minutes to get from the hotel to the airport for my homebound flight so it was really convenient as an overnight stop."
6,1615,"Jun 16 2009 	good hotel but far from center	I move to this hotel as i booked at Raunak hotel but it was nightmare there. this hotel is far from center about 30 mins but it's about 20 mins to airport and about 15 mins to big shopping mall which i am happy over there. the residence room is nice as it's similar to service apartment. you got living area and kitchen counter with microwave and shower. but shower always leaking out from the shower door and i rang the staff since teh first day but never come to fix it. the water is all over the floor everytimes i had a shower but the overall of the room is good. the hotel lobby is nice with modern style. the staffs is ok but not really communicate among themself first. i was plan to go to lotus temple and reception guy call to chek that it's open or not. he said it's open on that day but when we went their it was close. also, when we already booked the taxi to go to the airport. 3 staffs keep asking did you book the taxi yet and they want to charge me for the taxi even my package in my guest profile said 'included 1 way trasfer to airport'. the room service food is nice there but the breakfast is quite abit limit in choices. the internet is expensive also. it's RS 250 per hour. we paid at 3,500RS per night and i stay for 4 nights which i'm quite happy with the overall."
7,1615,Jun 2 2009 	Very nice Room Nice Hotel Awful Location	Sutese were very nice. Very modern and well equipped. Terrible view from window of high canvas fence installed I am sure to hide the view of the quite awful neighbourhood outside.Restaurant was nice with very pleasant staff. Food was fine if somewhat limited in choice. The restaurant was unlicenced and there was no bar in the hotel.Swimming Pool (Indoor) was unfortunately so cold we were not brave enough to use it. Otherwise recreation area was very good.
8,1615,"Oct 24 2008 	GReat Hotel	This is a very nice, clean well serviced hotel. Location isn't great but for a nice room and attentive staff, it is fantastic. The gym is great, on staff massages available. The food is fine--and they staff will attempt to make anything for you. the internet is really good, although expensive.A great find."
9,1615,"Jul 5 2008 	Pub with no beer!	We arrived at the Avalon Courtyard after flying in from Australia.We travelled along rutted filthy streets in the rain so our first impression of India was not so good.The driver pulled into a lane way and said here we are, we couldn't see a hotel!Once inside a huge and atractive atruim apeared, it was very nice, our room was lovely, very big with kitchenette, living area and bedroom with well appointed bathroom, a good suprise.The restaurant served excellent food, only one drawback.....it is a dry hotel, no bar, no liquor served at all and it is in the midle of nowhere so nowehere to go and buy any.For a group of Aussies arriving after 14 hours of travelleing that was not a good thing.Other than the location and lack of beverage it is a very good value hotel that I would hapily recomend, just BYO!"
10,1615,"Mar 24 2008	Easy entry to India	Very clean, modern and reasonably quiet. Breakfast was served early for us as we were on an early train to Agra."
11,1615,"Mar 14 2008 	Ultra modern noisy and charmless.	My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night at the end of our recent holiday.The Avalon Courtyard is ultra modern and totally lacking in any of the character and charm we experienced during our stays at all the other wonderful heritage hotels and palaces throughout our trip. To say my girlfriend hated it would not be an over statement.When you enter it, you feel like you are walking onto the set of some science fiction movie. All the rooms open out onto corriders which overlook a central courtyard/atrium.There is one cafe style restaurant from which you could sit and watch people in the indoor pool if anyone used it. The hotel at the time of our stay (9th March 2008) had no licence to sell alcohol.As mentioned by the earlier reviewer, it is not conveniently located for access to other bars and restaurants, so a taxi would be necessary should you wish to do so. When we asked why this hotel was chosen for our last night, the reason given was its proximity to the airport.The room was very modern and clean although quite small. There was no bath. The walls must be incredibly thin as I counted next door's alarm going off 5 times as the occupant made maximum use of the snooze facility. The windows are single glazed and serve only to keep the rain out, since they are more or less ineffective at keeping out Delhi's noise. The view from our room was of a concrete wall separated from us by only 20 feet or so.On the positive side, the staff were extremely courteous and friendly. One even took the trouble to return my suitcase keys to me which I had accidently left in the room when we checked out!Overall, I would say if you can avoid staying here then do so. If not, then treat it as a stopover en-route to somewhere better."
12,1615,"Oct 29 2007 	Nice rooms friendly helpful staff	New property that had just opened this month. Rooms are spacious and well suited for a medium term stay. Microwave, couch and a small frig in each room. Beds are great. Very nice gym with new equipment. Drawbacks were a challenging location, nothing close by within walking distance so taxis required. Property faces village road with two ninety degree turns on the same block. Cars horns are used to warn motorist and pedestrians as they approach the corners. Staying towards the back of property is recommended."
1,1616,"Nov 14 2009 	Spacious clean and good service	Stayed at this hotel while on holiday in Delhi. Female traveller alone. This hotel was away from the centre of Delhi so make time to travel in and out. Rooms are spacious, modern. Service was prompt and the food was good.Pool area is a bit run down and not very well attended. As a single lady the attention at breakfast was a bit too much - lots of staring and people coming out of the kitchen to look too. Another downside was the lack of hot water in the afternoons; had to wait until 6pm each day. I all a good hotel where single females will feel okay."
2,1616,"Aug 10 2009 	Good for our one night pre-flight stay	We stayed at the Claremont because we were looking for a reasonably priced, clean comfortable hotel near the Delhi airport. Distance-wise, the hotel is not that far, however it took us 40 minutes to drive to the airport at 7:15am on a Monday morning. We had planned for at least that amount of time, so it wasn't a problem. The hotel also allowed for us to have 3 adults and 2 children in one room. When making the reservation it stated we'd have 2 beds. Our room had 1 King and 1 twin bed that was brought in, so it really only slept 3 comfortably. The room was clean apart from a few stains on the carpet. One bothersome thing regarding the room was that there was no deadbolt and no latch on the door. The only way to lock the door while inside the room was to use the key (an actual metal key) to turn the lock. Also, the safe in our room was not functioning, so we made certain not leave anything of value in the room when we went out to dinner. The front desk staff and restaurant staff were very friendly. The restaurant offered a dinner buffet or an a la carte menu. The menu offered Indian and Chinese options and we were happy with the variety of choices. Overall, this hotel served our purpose of having a clean room with a hot shower before our early morning flight."
3,1616,Jun 16 2009 	Good Place for Private Function.	Although it was my cousin marriage arrangement on 09-May-09; Really good stay and dining arrangement with family for couple of days. Hall &amp; Poolside Lawn are perfectly maintain for private function.
4,1616,Jun 16 2009 	Made with Class	Hotel is made with class &amp; surrounded with greenary area. Staff was Courteous &amp; well groomed. I really recommend this Hotel.
5,1616,Jun 3 2009 	Nice Hotel for Stay	Room are quite spacetous; Coffee Shop Blue Pearl ambience is impressive &amp; food is wow.. specialy indian &amp; pasta's ; open pool with huge lawn for exercise or move around. Over all nice hotel for stay with friend and famliy.
6,1616,"Mar 29 2009 	Generally OK	Not a bad hotel. Cox and Kings travel agency used it as an &quot;airport hotel&quot; although it's a 25 minute drive from the airport. The rooms are clean and decent, but the &quot;hot&quot; water was only lukewarm when I took a shower at 3:00am."
7,1616,"Dec 5 2007 	Horrible Place to Stay	On the tail end of an otherwise wonderful trip to Rajastan India, we were booked into this property by Castle and King TourServices. On our first day we were welcomed into a severelysmoked out room (we had requested a non-smoking room). We were told we would be transferred. After around fifteen minutes,we contacted the front desk and were told &quot;All rooms sold out!!!We can transfer you in the morning&quot;. We then encounted a non flushing toilet and had to use the lobby facilities all evening. Noassistance to repair was available. My wife, after coming out of the shower, told me 'Stay away from the shower curtain, it has a lot of mold on it&quot;. So went our stay at the Claremont.We left for Khajarao in the AM with a promise that we would be upgraded to a much better room when we returned to Delhi. I thought seriously about transferring to another hotel, but the payments for all three nights we already surrendered to the Claremont.When we returned to Delhi we were surprised to be upgraded to the &quot;executive suites&quot;. The toilet worked and the shower curtain was fine. Unfortunately the room was right above the disco or club facility so for two nights we had to listen to the unusual bollywood disco sounds until midnight or closer to 1AM.Our general opinion of our tour all over India was great. The people, sights, sounds, and food made for a memorable trip. The only bad thing was the way it ended in Delhi. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL!!!"

2,1618,"Dec 29 2008 	Nightmare	It is totaly overpriced and pure nightmare. Staff sleeping on the floor and cleaning means spraying insecticides.The phone on the floor rings very loudly every time the hotel gets a call - annoying, it's impossible to sleep. The room is smelly, warm water tap doesn't work. Lot of parts have never been cleaned, fridge doesn't work and is very dirty. Breakfast room is ridiculous, dishes not clean. And so on! The hotel is just disgusting!Pay attention, there are 2 hotels in Delhi named &quot;Conclave&quot;. The other one is ok as far as I know."
3,1618,"Oct 28 2008 	Will Not Be Staying Here Any Time Soon Again!!!	I am still trying to figure out how this place considers itself a step above others!!! We were booked to stay a couple of nights and we only stayed one. It was our last day in Delhi together and we wanted to get an early start to enjoy the entire day. Well, that was quickly thwarted when for some unknown reason, we could not get any hot water. The heater was on but it got lost in translation along the way from heater to shower head!!! But, let me back up a bit.Our first problem was with the A/C. At this property, there are wall unit air conditioners. I don't know how the other units look, but ours had a lovely brownish-yellow water stain framing it. Truly unsightly!! How difficult and how long would it take to just prime and paint that??? The A/C definitely had a mind of its own turning on, turning off, turning on, turning off! And every time someone came up to fix it, they set it to an arctic 19C degrees!!!So, let's go back to the hot water issue. After calling the front desk to report no hot water, a young man was sent up to investigate. I think he turned a few knobs, clicked the heater on and off and when I asked if it was ok, a gutteral grunt was the response. I wondered if that was yes or no. I am thinking now it was a no because after about a 10 minute wait, I checked again and still no hot water. Another call to the front desk. Now, the front desk person along with gutteral grunter show up. They tinker around a bit and tell us to wait 5 minutes and the hot water will come. It didn't. Call again. This time a barrage of people show up at the door and all file into our cramped room to further investigate the situation. Again, a suggestion to wait 5 minutes and they all shuffle out.Still no hot water. Call again. At this point, I am on the internet (which, by the way was great and perhaps the ONLY bright spot about this place) trying to find us another place to stay! We are told an engineer is on his way up. In the meantime, they send up gutteral grunter with a bucket of hot water to accommodate a shower for two people. Are they kidding? No thanks.The engineer shows up and assures us there will be hot water. At this point we have now lost about 2 hours or more from our day. Well, the hot water finally did arrive...we showered and promptly checked out, much to their amazement!!! How could they have been shocked over our departure??? The room was rather cramped, pretty dark and the mattress felt like it must have seen one too many guests - definitely in need of replacement. Again, the only bright spot was the internet connection which I will say was very good and although the room service was quite quick and the food reasonably tasty, it was without a doubt way over-priced!!We ended up in a 5 -star hotel after leaving this place paying a mere $81 more for the night than we paid for our one night at Hotel Conclave Comfort, but it was well worth it because our last night was spent in HEAVEN in comparison!!This place is WAY over-priced for the quality of room and service and I do not recommend it, not even for a one night stay!!!"
1,1619,Nov 17 2009 	You get what you pay for	Corus is supposed to provide a 3 star experience to a business traveler with limited budget and location (CP) in mind. For the frugal sorts whose budget is below 4K this seems to be the best place available. Though if you increase your budget to 5K there are better places.My experience was average with the following high/low points:The goods:1. Rooms and bathrooms were clean and the AC/TV/Mini Fridge worked well. They were small but as I said if you want to stay in CP for less than 4K your choices are limited.2. Staff is extremely courteous/professional and helpful.3. Cafe coffee day at the entrance and the general location is excellent as far as connectivity is concerned. (Inner circle B blcok)The bads:1. Problems with internet. In 4 days the internet was non functional for nearly half the time. A big nono for a business traveller.2. The buffet breakfast included in the price - is just plain bad. Didn't even bother going to the restaurant after the first morning.
2,1619,"Jun 19 2009 	Comfortable Stay	I stayed in the hotel for two nights &amp; enjoyed my stay . The hotel is very centrally located .The room had a wonderful view . I could see entire Connaught Place. alongwith the &quot;Central Park&quot;, ( I think that's what they call it ! ). The breakfast was included in the room rate , so we could have it in the room or in the restaurant with no extra charges.  &quot; Bonsai &quot; the Restaurant very well done up , vibrant and fresh look , served excellent food and drinks in style ,( nice bar ! ) , not missing the wonderful outside garden area. Definitely this is the kind of hotels you want to find. I'll be back."
3,1619,"Mar 27 2009 	Good location ok hotel.. by Delhi standards	Corus was the most expensive hotel we stayed at in India and it certainly was not the best. This is to be expected of hotels in Delhi which are all over priced and not worth the cost.The location was great, right on the center ring of Connaught Place in between Old and New Delhi. The sidewalk and streets in front of the hotel were filthy and filled with people begging for money. But, upon entering the hotel the vibe is much better.. there's a great coffee shop in the front (with REAL coffee, hard to find in India). And the check-in lobby was welcoming. The staff were helpful were quick to respond when we needed something. The rooms overlook a (loud) restaurant/bar but we were never kept up by the noise. The rooms are on the small side but aren't bad. Breakfast.. just stay away from the fly covered fruit on the buffet and order from the menu. The food we got from room service was great!I would recommend this hotel if it's in your price range."
4,1619,"Feb 3 2009 	Rooms 209-211 ONLY -- all the rest are dungeons	We had three rooms for our group, two of which were dumps. No windows and no life. But one room on the top floor at the front of the building had access to a superb terrace with a gorgeous view of the Connaught Place. Others have complained about all kinds of aspects, and they're true. It's kinda dirty, the breakfast was terrible, and the rooms are horrid without the terrace. But, folks, this is Delhi. It's really hard to find a good place here without paying a fortune. The location of the Corus is superb, and for me that helped to make up for the downsides. I'd probably not go back unless I had rooms 209, 210 or 211 guaranteed."
5,1619,"Jan 29 2009 	great location - dirty hotel	Stayed with family for three nights at the beginning of a 3 week holiday. Though the location was convenient to every place we intended to visit, this hotel was a depressing first impression of what to expect in India. The tiny rooms could have been cleaner. Dirty, cracked windows gave us our first look outside. Staff was friendly and helpful - a positive! In retrospect, it would have been better to do a little more research prior to just booking with the tour agency (Indian Moments) and selected a different hotel based on the experience of other trip advisor travelers. Fortunately most of the other hotels were of higher quality than the Corus."
6,1619,"Dec 19 2008	Depressing experience	Barely better than a backpackers hostel, this &quot;hotel&quot; wasone of the worst I have ever stayed in. Very noisy, rooms offexternal corridor backing onto dirty back streets. Very basic amenities,worn sheets, bug-tablets in &quot;bathroom&quot;, no hot water.No lift, had to lug bags upstairs.Breakfast minimal on patio next to streets.Unfortunately next step up was to 4-star hotels, more thandouble price, but we made it and were relieved and thrilled."
7,1619,"Dec 1 2008 	Worst hotel I've ever stayed it BUT...	Myself and 3 colleagues stayed at the Corus at the end of November for a week. The hotel was booked by our Indian colleagues and after reading the reviews on here I was a little concerned. However, although there were problems the hotel was reasonable - and much better than I had anticipated. The main problems were:- No hot water for showers- My room was the only room with a window- the shower flooded the bathroom when you used it- At night it was very noisy outside and my colleague had a boiler above his room which made noise constantly- The room serivce was terrible - microwaved, luke warm processed food- The beds were too short for a person of average height- The loo roll only had about 4 squares of paper!However, none of the above were massive problems for us. I used earplugs every night, kept asking for loo roll and braved the cold water and it was fine. I havent stayed in other hotels in India so have nothing to compare it to, but it exceeded my expectations - and there were some plus points:- The staff were always helpful and friendly - the manager in particular was lovely - The beds were fairly comfortable (after getting used to them!)- The mini bar was fine for drinks- We were all provided with a large free bottle of mineral water every day- The rooms were clean and I had no problem with bugs etc- We had airport pick up which was fineSo overall this hotel is fine if you are looking for somewhere just as a base, but I know it is fairly expensive and you could probably get something better for your money."
8,1619,Nov 30 2008	OK hotel	We stayed here for one night at the beginning of our stay in India. We arrived to our room around 11 pm and requested an 8 am wake-up call. Either they misunderstood us or there 8 am looked like 3 am and guess what we were woken at 3 am. Our room was small with no window so we could only assume it was 8 am. We got dressed and then looked at our watch so we ended up drinking tea in the room until breakfast. Breakfast was outside in a patio area and was done very nice. They didn't put out an abundance of food so the hotel must have not been full but it was tasty. There is no elevator in the hotel. The lobby is up a flight of steps on the 2nd floor so if steps are a problem this would not be a good choice. It appeared to be in a good location of the city but we left early so only walked around the park which was across the street from the hotel. The hotel offers free internet service. This is a no frill hotel but was clean and adequate for one night.
9,1619,"Oct 7 2008	Mixed experience	Hotel was reasonable, rooms very small but clean, excellent location right on the inner circle of Connaught Place. The first room we were shown had no windows but they then moved us to one at the back with a window off an external corridor. This was much brighter but anyone walking along the corridor could look through the window into our room meaning that we had to keep the curtains closed a lot of the time. There were a lot of bugs that came up through the shower drain, but perhaps this is just a feature of New Delhi.Reception staff seemed either exceptionally helpful or surly, no in between.Theres also a great coffee shop at the front and a nice restaurant/bar on the ground floor.Overall a reasonable hotel for the money, in a great location. Next time though, I might choose to spend a little more and stay elsewhere."
10,1619,"Sep 2 2008 	Dirty and stained	A friend booked this hotel through a travel agent and when I checked out the hotel on TripAdvisor, the pictures made it look much more promising than it really was. Walking in, I was taken aback by the trash on the stairs. The rooms weren't any better. A green chair had deep undertones of brown because it was so dirty. When I pulled back the blanket, the sheets and pillow cases were stained and was covered with strands of hair. The shower wall was covered with soap scum and grime. The air conditioning was either not in commission or at an uncontrollable full blast. The walls had obviously suffered some water damage and were stained.On the plus side, everyone who worked there went out of their way to try to be helpful.Still, would never stay at this hotel again."
11,1619,"Jul 30 2008	Cought the door bell man STEALING from my bags	Horrible experience.Picture this. You go out for dinner and forget your camera. Go back to the hotel and, when you open the door to your room: surprise! There is the door bell man INSIDE THE ROOM STEALING FROM THE BAGS! I cought him in the act and I was shocked because he had broken into the room just after I left. The manager from the hotel asked me not to call the police, and try to &quot;digest it&quot;.Do I need to say anything else?"
12,1619,"Jul 5 2008 	One of the best options in New Delhi	I worked in Delhi for a few months and needed a convenient hotel that stayed within my budget. Corus hotel ended up being my favorite option.Delhi is not a place famous for its service or efficiency, so bearing that in mind, Corus hotel was far and away better than its peers.The best part of the hotel is its location - the inner circle of Connaught Pl. You are right in the heart of Delhi and next to the subway/metro which is actually a safe and convenient way to get to some destinations in the city (e.g., Red Fort / Old Delhi).The rooms are small and some bathrooms are better than others, however, the place is quite clean, the beds are more comfortable than most, and typically, you do have hot water. (Please keep in mind that in India absolutely none of these things can be taken for granted.) The rate includes breakfast which is just OK, but better than nothing. There is a fairly good japanese restaurant on the first floor of the hotel, with a garden. The food is pretty good, if a little expensive. Careful though - some nights it turns into a disco, so rooms in the 'back' of the hotel are sometimes subject to loud noise until 11 or 12 in the night. The hotel also has a decent room services and some continental options, as well as traditional Indian. A &quot;Cafe Coffee Day&quot; is connected to the hotel in the front, which is the Indian equivalent of Starbucks, which can be a nice bonus (the brownie sundae is recommended).Good luck! Bring plenty of pepto-bismal and immodium. You will need it -- but it will be worth it."
13,1619,"Apr 8 2008 	not great but given location and cost probably a good option	This hotel has a great location on connaught circle and the funky asian fusion restaurant with nice garden downstairs is also really good (had been craving california rolls so was happy to see the restaurant when we turned up!) The rooms however are not great. First time we stayed we had a standard room, which could also be called world's smallest room, and the bathroom, barely room to turn around. Still it was fairly clean but we didn't sleep well at all as we were right by the stairs so it was really noisy. Second time we stayed in the next grade of room up which was a much better size but had no window and had a funny mothball smell. They have little white balls in the sink (according to my husband you get these in urinals) and i found the smell really overpowering. Still from all my searching online for hotels in delhi it seems you either pay extortionate amounts for a luxury hotel and then peanuts for some really basic rooms so would say this is probably a good mid-range option."
14,1619,"Feb 29 2008 	Best value in New Delhi	Hotels in New Delhi are notoriously overpriced, and after four nights in subpar but highpriced hotels we stumbled across the Corus Hotel in Connaught Place. We liked what we saw and immediately booked a room for our return five weeks later. What a joyfull experience when we returned! Friendly, uniformed staff with excellent English skills and eager to help in every way; small, but spotless and beautifully furnished room with an excellent bathroom; serene isolation from the chaos of the city; interior garden restaurant. All the trimmings of a well-managed hotel. Price was Rs 5000...about US$135. The final graceful touch was after allowing a late checkout, they offered us the free use of an available room in which to rest before our late night departure to the airport."
15,1619,"Jan 27 2008	Make Sure You Don't Pay Much	The Corus Hotel's location is very good - right in Connaught Place. The hotel itself is mediocre. Our room was small with a lot of ambient noise. The staff was friendly though the front desk was understaffed. As others have commented, there's no real lobby to the hotel - instead you walk through a cafe up some stairs to get to a tiny lobby. The breakfast however was very good."
16,1619,"Dec 13 2007 	Avoid At All Costs!	The first problem we encountered was finding this place as it has no frontage like most hotels, it is basically located upstairs inside the Bonsai restaurant. The reception area is small like a corridor, but adequate, nothing grand. We stayed at the hotel on two occasions over three weeks as the hotel was booked by the tour guide. On our first stay for 3 days the room was fine, nothing luxury about it just a basic room with a good view of Connaught Place central park. The next morning we discovered no hot running water, and had to call for assistance, the hotel staff made up a number of excuses regarding the boiler being broke, this is already on some of the reviews for this hotel left by others, so i was pre-warned! The third day the toilet stopped flushing so we had to call an engineer again, later the cold running water ceased to work from the bathroom washbasin. In the end they brought us a bucket of hot water with a jug to wash in, not very practical or hygenic but it was better than not batheing at all. The breakfast was absolutely rubbish, a mish mash of foods not edible together. The juices were very warm and not drinkable, the butter so hard you couldnt spread it on the toast. The restaurant itself was very basic, not the cleaniest place we've eaten at. On our second stay things got worse, we were given a room with no window, and again it had only luke warm water to bathe in...and no bath tub only stand in shower. Apparently out of 65 rooms only 6 have windows, so be warned, we had the premium room with a window!! The air con was extremely noisy so we switched it off, but the humidity in the room was awful as there was no air or natural light. Summing up this hotel, i would recommend you pay extra and try somewhere like connaught hotel. We stayed at 6 hotels during our stay in India and all the rest were good to pure luxury, this hotel is really a 1.5*, i couldtn give it even 2 stars as i dont think it is worthy of it."
17,1619,"Nov 12 2007 	Not bad...	I stayed in this hotel on October 2007 for 4 nights. Everything depends on what you expect from an hotel especailly if you are going to stay in Delhi... If you spend most of your time in the hotel to meet some friends or colleagues, I don't recommend it.. But if you are gonna be out of the hotel during the entire day and go to the hotel only to sleep, then there is no point to spend a lot of money to the other 5 star hotels which you need to pay between 300-500 USD per night... First of all this hotel's location is perfect... It's at the Inner Circle of Connaught Place [--] where you can find many international fast food restaurants, shopping places, post office, etc.. and close to the all local bazaars. The hotel is clean and modernly decorated. There is hot water but you need to wait for few minutes to get it as they most probably use solar panels during the day and central heating system at nights... If you order the cheapest room from their website, you'll stay in a room without a window.. Actually this is not a problem for me as I never stay in my room during the day. There was no big bath towel in the room but when you ask for it, they bring more than you ask. There is no hair dryers in the rooms either. You can ask for it too (if it's available) but it's not powerful. There is air condition, mini bar (without much options) and TV (showing mainly local channels) in the room. They have free wireless internet and I didn't face a connection problem. There is no lobby where you can sit and wait for someone but there is a modern-nice and popular coffee at the entrance of the hotel.. There is also a nice open air restaurant (Bonsai) in the hotel. I don't recommend to order a pick up service from the airport especially if you arrive to Delhi late at night. I have ordered one but there was no one waiting for me (Later, they apologized for the mistake and provided me a car for my departure). It's better to take a &quot;pre-paid taxi&quot; from the airport and go to the hotel by your self (I paid 350 rupees). The taxi drivers may not know the name of the hotel but if you tell the driver to take you to the Connaught Place Inner Circle, you will easily find the hotel. As a result, this is not the best hotel that I stayed so far but if you won't feel uncomfortable with some small problems, I can recommend it.."
18,1619,"Nov 8 2007	Worst Value Hotel in Four Month Trip	I picked the Corus after reading the latest review in Lonely Planet. Don't make the same mistake. This hotel was totally over-priced for the quality of the experience. It cost 5000 rps, plus tax, for a double room. For that we got:- One hot shower in four days;- The shower cubicle filled with water after 2 minutes and completely flooded our bathroom.- The only way the staff could get the hot water to work was by turning on the hot water tap in the sink, and then letting the shower run for 10 minutes. But of course, that totally flooded the bathroom. - No window.- Only intermittent television and Internet reception.- The air conditioning system was so loud it kept us awake at night.- The staff were friendly, but unhelpful. When we had problems they couldn't fix them, and if they made any attempt they expected a tip. We needed an extra bed for one night, and it took us five calls to reception (over 8 hours) to get it. We only got it because we were going to bed and refused to leave the reception room until it was done.I was also annoyed at the price. When I rang the hotel to make the booking I was told it was 5000 rupees, tax included. When I came to pay I was told that tax was not included. I paid, but said I was annoyed at being misled on the phone. The hotel then lied and claimed that I had booked through a travel agent!Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel!!! For this price you can find a much better place in Delhi."
19,1619,"Sep 30 2007 	Nice little place in the centre of town	After looking on here for reviews, my colleague &amp; I said it looked a safe bet. The hotel has a very good location. The reception area is nice &amp; was being refurbished when we arrived. My room was in the main block &amp; had no windows. It was very quiet. Air con &amp; fan worked really well. The only problem was getting hot water. There was never any. I didn't mind too much as it was extremely hot and humid so a cold shower suited me fine. The free internet was a bonus too. I would recommend this hotel to others. The price was good. A nice restuarant is included inside the hotel too."
20,1619,"Aug 27 2007 	Many probelms with the Corus!	We booked this hotel because a collegue from work recomended this place and because Hotels in Delhi are overcharged and we didn't wanted to spend so much. We booked directly with their webpage and also payed for the airport pick up, since we arrived late at night. When we arrived to the airport, no one was there to pick us up. We had to pay a pre-paid taxi from the airpot who brought us to Connaught place, but once we were there he told us he didn't know this hotel. The streets were deserted so he entered another hotel to ask for directions at 1am in the morning! No one knew how to get to the Corus. After half an hour of asking and being lost we finally arrived. We were furious to know why they didn't picked us up at the airport, but to our surprise they didn't even had our reservation since their webpage took one day to process the information (but didn't say so in the web page!!!) The hotel is ok, the bed is clean but the bathroom is awful! no hot water! no comfort at all and found many big insects at the shower. The breakfast buffet is good, and the restaurant staff very kind. However the front desk staff was almost rude and unprofessional. After this experience we suggest to pay a little bit more to be in a nicer hotel but be more confortable in Delhi and enjoy more the city."

We stayed here for 3 nights after arriving in India for a 3 week tour.The room was large but with grubby sheets,tepid water and the special bonus of blood stained towels!The breakfast which comes to the room is only white sliced toast although we noticed Indian guests having cooked food in the corridor as there is no dining room.Mysteriously we got a letter from the Manager telling us chicken was off the menu due to bird flu!The one saving grace is the location at the heart of Connaught Place with a new Metro station outside and you can walk in the evening to a number of good quality restaurants very close by."
24,1619,"Nov 21 2005	False Impressions	Their motto is &quot;Hospitality Redefined&quot; which, after reading this personal account, is quite apt but for all the wrong reasons.Dirty, old sheets (one covered in blood, which was not removed after 3 requests), cold showers (was told to run the water for upwards of 5 mins - but even longer running time led to no more than strictly lukewarm), no restaurant / eating room (breakfasts in your own bedroom (no table, only 1 chair - none of which is conducive to business travel), generator blasting away just outside our rooms (accessed via a balcony-style corridor, overlooking a shambles outside), phone bills charged to your room, no toilet paper, only Pepsi in the room bar, no offstreet parking, no formal hotel entrance, but instead a flight of steps up from street level, a street covered in dust &amp; traders.All this for the exhorbitant fee of U$155 nightly, plus 12% Delhi hotel tax fee. Owner would not budge when asked for a refund, based on the above issues. It just so happened that Delhi was more or less fully booked for a Trade Convention, so no chance of relocating, otherwise I would have done so.Definitely not 3-star material, don't be fooled by the name, their motto or the web pictures.In short, avoid like the plague."

I wouldn't suggest ordering anything, walk around the corner and get a veggie burger at McDonalds. Karol Bagh is really busy - I suggest not staying in this area if at all possible. The only food options are McDonalds and the Indian sweet shop - Bikanervala. Book on makemytrip.com for best pricing."
3,1621,"Jun 12 2009 	Warning about Crest Inn's Bus Tour to Agra/Taj Mahal	I just wanted to let people know that you need to be very careful about bus tours to Agra. I took the bus tour that departs from the Crest Inn. I thought it would be a safe bet because the Crest Inn website has a page devoted to the bus tour so it seemed relatively professional and structured for tourists. Not so. It was the off season so I was the only non-Indian, english-speaker on the bus. The driver was curt and didn't understand my questions and attempted to leave without me after breakfast. He was only stopped from doing so because they got a flat tire just a couple hundred feet down the road. I'd like to think this wasn't intentional, but I feel it's pretty tough not to notice that the one white person is not onboard. Then, when we came to the first stop in agra (the Red Fort), I split off from the group because they aggressively encouraged me to take a different guide that speaks all English, promising me that we'd all meet at the bus out front. But when we had finished our tour, my bus was nowhere to be found. Luckily there are infinite transportation-for-hire options in India so I was able to make it to the Taj Mahal and home again using alternate transportation. But the trip is a long, hot, stressful one as it is so I'd advise anyone considering a bus tour to consider alternate options or else make very good friends with the driver."
4,1621,"Mar 20 2009 	Everything is New	The Crest Inn hotel is not located in the best part of Delhi, but to their credit, once you are inside everything is brand spanking new. Our hotel room even still had its furniture in a semi-wrapped state! This is one of the cleanest places you will find in Delhi, it was the only place where the bedsheets and towels did not need to be changed out the minute we entered the room. We also loved the way the room was set-up, especially the presence of a large double bed. Two downsides remain with this inn--the shower area in the bathroom is not segregated so be prepared to have a very wet bathroom floor after you've taken a shower! Secondly, the hotel restaurant is not much for food, so be prepared to head out for all your meals."

The hotel was booked by a travel agent and the 2 star rating was lower than we had talked about. The room we had, had not been remodeled yet, however, I thought that with a few repairs and detailing the room would justify a higher rating. We felt that the room was cleaner than we expected. We didn't see any bugs or big problems. During the day we could here alot of remodeling going on in other rooms in the hotel. The hum of the air conditioner pretty much drown out the road noise, it kept the room plenty cool. Room service was good. The menu was pretty good and the food reasonable priced for room service. Chowmein and a order of spring rolls was less than $5 US and seemed to be plenty to eat for the 2 of us. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. We usually tipped 10 %, but some of the staffed seem surprized. The area looked scarey, but we never felt in danger wandering down the streets. I would recommend this hotel for a budget traveler."

The breakfast offer is terrible - cheap nasty cereals, runny porridge, runny yoghurt, runny scrambled egg that was white!! Mini single serving pots of jam on the tables were already used! And worst of all a curly black hair on the overcooked greasy bacon. The room service is prompt but never seemed to come with everything described on the menu and was generally cold and greasy. The Chinese restaurant on the top floor wasn't too bad but nothing to shout about. Overall, not impressed for a hotel of this standard. I stayed at the Intercontinental last time I was here on business and would rather stay there next time."
8,1622,"Sep 29 2009 	Quiet hotel in a busy city	It was our first time in India and at a Crowne Plaza hotel. We were not disappointed in our choice. On arrival everything during registration was completed while we had a cold drink. Our room overlooked the pool and entrance to the hotel. The room was quite large with a very welcome fridge, there were always bottles of water on our return every day.The Atrium bar is lovely and quiet but like everywhere in India expensive. The first night we ate in the hotel, think it was called Le Cafe, it is where the breakfasts are served, we did not have the buffet although it looked very good. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our tour.We ate a a Chinese not too far from the hotel and felt perfectly safe walking around. During our stay in April the pool was very cold but the pool area was pleasant.Would recommend this hotel if you want to stay away from the very busy city. My only negative would be the price of using the business centre to access the Internet, very expensive.Staff were polite and helpful."
9,1622,"Aug 11 2009 	Beautiful	LIke most 5* hotels in India, this is a great stay. Great staff, food and entertainment. The pool is amazing also. You can rent a driver and car and tour around Delhi, which is amazing. It was my birthday when we booked in and as you have to give your passport they saw the date and arrived up to my room with a birthday cake, present and flowers. Staff are amazing and add a very personal touch to everything."
10,1622,Aug 8 2009	Crowne Plaza - Should first learn the meaning of Hospitality!!!	Before venturing into hospitality industry......i suggest you learn the meaning of the word Hospitality......Crowne Plaza should make sure that the staff &quot;Does not Humiliate and Insult&quot; its guests.Learn the Basics before even thinking of running a hotel....
11,1622,"Jul 16 2009 	Exceeded Expectations Almost	We were at this hotel for only two days. The service was way above standard for India, about average by Canadian standards. The rooms were the cleanest of anywhere we stayed in India and it was a treat to stay somewhere where there were no major upkeeps needed- rare it seems in Delhi. The food was average in the restaurant, but the service was quick. In fact, the room service was above average. They delivered to us outside of hours and within minutes. The only problem we had was at check out. We had booked through Travelocity which charged our Visa two months in advance, so we had already paid. They charged us again at check out, so we were double charged. The gentleman at the front desk said that travelocity only held the room, which I knew was not true. We are currently working with travelocity to receive a refund for the first charge."
12,1622,"Jul 5 2009 	Only So-So; Should be Improved	I was here for a week-plus. The hotel was booked by local colleagues for its location to the office, and sort-of-good facilities. It was only a fair stay all around.My room on the 6th floor was small and cramped feeling, as was the bathroom. All of the typical business-class hotel amenties are there: ironing board, TV, bathroom toiletries, internet access, etc. Housekeeping was fine, but the room is starting to feel worn.We ate in every retaurant in the hotel since our days were very long we were too tired to venture out much. While none of them were bad, none of the restaurants were particularly good, either. The restaurant on the top floor that had some Thai AND Italian items on the menu (not a good sign) played dorkey 80's music at dinner. I recommend that you explore the area for dining, ask for recommendations outside the hotel, etc. if you have the energy. The price/value will also be better, I'm sure.The staff are well-meaning and try hard, but are not polished. Better training would help as you can tell they are trying to please -- it's not an attitude problem.The pool looks nice, but I had no time for it.The surrounding area is not that attractive, but partly that's Delhi, i.e. trash everywhere, traffic, no sidewalks, etc.So: the stay was not a disaster, but I'll try to stay elsewhere when back in Delhi. India has traditionally not welcomed international investment in infrastructure, and it shows in the price/value of the available hotels. But there are better in town.(Filed for my husband - he won't get his own account.)"
13,1622,"Jun 21 2009 	Could be better	was there with some business partners from Japan, overall OK but for the kind of charges they have it cld have been better, they have customised services for japanese guests like TV channels, breakfast in japanese style etc. Food is not too great for the kind of money they charge, better to eat out in the shopping arcade outside the hotel"
14,1622,Jun 19 2009	Extravagant party	The staff at the Crowne Plaza Hotel New Delhi is outstanding. I had price issues with our first night stay. The hospital that booked us waited to long to get the lower price rooms. I was forced into the higher price and didn' t know until check out. We paid and went on to the hospital where I was admitted. One of the managers came to the hospital to speak with us. I was impressed. We went back after I left the hospital. Room was lovely. Used hotel guide/driver for 3 days. Awesome! He made our trip! Service slow in main restaurant and food not to our liking. The Japanese restaurant was awesome!
15,1622,"Jun 10 2009 	Good quality and reasonable value	I've stayed in the Crowne Plaza, Friend's Colony, Delhi on many trips. The property is large and well-appointed if not particularly attractive to look at fomr the exterior.The rooms are comfortable and clean. The food is good and room service very efficient. In some areas the property is beginning to look a little tired/out of date but that is a minor observation. The location is handy for New Delhi and anyone travelling/working across south Delhi/Noida. It's in a peaceful, upmarket suburb. The gym is modern, well-equipped and well-managed and the pool is popular. The property attracts large up-market groups of tourists, local business-types, flashy parties and business travellers. At the time of writing (June 2009) the room rates are competitive but as always everything else (e.g. laundry/food/wi-fi) is comparatively expensive."
16,1622,"Jun 8 2009 	Loved the Ambience	I had an opportunity to visit new delhi recently and to stay at crowne plaza , new delhi. At the ist sight of the hotel , i was excited and knew that I had made the right choice. Check in was really easy, with cooperative staff. The room was very good and exactly as promised on the hotel website. The stay was for 2 days but I extented it for a day to enjoy the hospitality for a bit longer. In short, it was worth it."
17,1622,"Jun 6 2009 	lovely rooms	Surya has large and spacious rooms.the food is excellent.the front office staff is very efficient but not well groomed.the hotel building is not very beautiful but it`s quiet functional.location is good too, considering the size of delhi."
18,1622,Jun 3 2009 	Good for business	five star hotelgood for official partieslocated in posh south delhicentral location in southgood servicegood food
19,1622,"Jun 3 2009 	Quite contemporary	nice and cozy environment! had a one night stay....the room was quite contemporary.. floor 3/ regular twin bed room!nice breakfast, great room service... bathroom fitted with latest amenities...defintely a recommend for any frequent travellers!"
20,1622,"May 31 2009	LOVED THE CONVENIENCE	Most covenient as regards the location , my office being on one of the floors of the hotel building itself.The hotel has all the faclities required to unwind post the day's work with a courteous staff to guide and assist with.Finally to end the day , the chinese is absolutely delicious.One step more to relax , the shopping arcade is reasonably priced and shopkeepers open to negotiation so one can get a steal."
21,1622,"May 29 2009 	Standard business class hotel	Sufficiently impressive for a hotel of its star rating, but nothing makes this hotel stand out from its competitors. The location is so-so, and the surrounding area less accomodating to intrepid guests than other parts of the city."
22,1622,"May 27 2009 	Poor value	In my experience the two superior hotel chains in the Intercontinental group - Intercontinental and Crowne Plaza - play weather-man and woman on pricing but Intercontinental is consistently superior on quality. This was certainly borne out by my experience here. This time around Crowne Plaza was a tad more expensive (for which read extortionate; this is Delhi, after all) than the admirable Nehru Place Intercontinental (full, alas) but some way behind on quality. The walls of the 'executive lounge' appear to have been painted by the same five year old responsible for the grouting around the shower!"
23,1622,"May 25 2009 	nice place worth a visit	nice place, nice membership benefitsclean, all facilities, centraly located.nice bufffets and everything u think is above normal grade.worth a visit really"
24,1622,"May 21 2009 	Great Hotel Poor service	The hotel did a very poor job of organizing the leisure package that I had selected. Even after talking to the resident Manager Mr Rehman, they did not address the matter. Very poor service for what the charges are. The room are well done and the restaurants &amp; spa area is very modern. Highly recommend the ayurvedic massage. Not very sure about service and quality since rates are equivalent to dollar standards but service is not."
25,1622,May 9 2009 	Only Price	If you are just looking for a good hotel just to stay for a couple of days. This hotel is a good choice.Just expect a decent Room adn nothing else including service
26,1622,"May 3 2009	A great place to stay if you have the misfortune of being in Delhi	Let's face it, New Delhi is not the greatest place to stay in what is the wonderful country of India. Sure, it's convenient for Aggra and as a brief stop-off before going to the North, but not really a great destination in it's own right. Anyhow, if you do happen do be in New Delhi (I was for 8-days on business April 2009) then I certainly recommend the Crowne Plaza. The rooms are excellent by any country's standards, and the staff are friendly and good fun if you make the effort to talk with them. The restuarants are pretty good (although sometimes a little pricey for what you get) and the bar is functional enough, although like others have said, lacking a bit in atmosphere. What really stands out at the Crowne Plaza Delhi is the excellent Gym and Spa. I used the gym every day I was there, followed by a sauna and swim. No charges, this is complimentary and of the highest quality. I paid 800rupees for a great shoulder and back massage too. The area that the hotel is placed in (New Friends Colony) is pretty crappy, but then again, where exactly is nice in Delhi? There are brief power cuts every day (but you have to expect this) but the gym treadmills are not affected by this!! The only downside for business stay as far as I was concerned is the slow internet connection which was pretty much non-functioning for the entire time I was there. Anyway, highly recommended hotel, especially for business - a bit of an oasis in Delhi!"
27,1622,"May 2 2009 	excellent place	Its an excellent hotel... Stayed there many a times on official visit... Excellent ambience, service, location"
28,1622,May 1 2009 	Good Hotel For Business Traveller	A good-quality business hotel in a convenient location with good dining options.
29,1622,"Apr 28 2009 	Don't stay there!	We had three separate one night stays here during a tour in India.Night 1- we were put in a disabled room, not ideal as we are both able bodied, but as only one night we put up with it.Night 2-we arrived early evening and when we switched on the lights some worked, some didn't, the TV and air con did not work. The electrician arrived quickly but by then we had been allocated what was supposed to be a premium room and as the paperwork had been completed we moved.( we had originally had a superior room). The smell of urine hit you as you walked into the room, we quickly realised that it was coming from the air con. By now it was getting late to eat so we again thought , only one night we will leave the air con off.Night 3- we arrived 11.00 pm. This room again smelled of urine but was superior room on the 2nd floor, again the air con was the problem, as all we wanted to do was sleep we left the air con off.The reception area was pleasant, some of the staff were surly others OK.Restaurant overpriced and staff not particularly helpful.Business centre charge for 30mins minimum for use of computer - 7.50 on current exchange rate.Would never recommend this hotel."
30,1622,Apr 28 2009 	Loved the hotel	The hotel is extremely good. Rooms are lavish and beautiful. I liked the hotel rooms the most.See the room photograph below.
31,1622,"Apr 27 2009 	Clean hotel but looking tired	This hotel is fine for business - not too expensive but rooms getting a bit shabby and tired,the hotel gym is small and smelly and is crowded as everyone gets there at the same time after work and your better in doing an early morning workout before you start work.food is apalling and the choice of western food is disappointing. Sister hotel Intercontinental has fresh bread compared to the crowne plaza food.found the staff helpful, but dont seem to remember regular faces."
32,1622,Apr 21 2009 	loved the stay	it was a very good and restful stay in the hotel
33,1622,"Apr 21 2009 	Good value for money	The hotel is well appointed in ambience, facilities and service."
34,1622,"Apr 20 2009 	Value for Money	Excellent location, warm welcome and Great food. This hotel, perhaps is the best in Delhi for business travellors. well connected to delhi and neihghbouring states UP, Haryana etc. The Shopping arcade &amp; food courts adjacent to the Hotel is the best. Very spacious lobby too, Rooma are big and has excellent view."
35,1622,"Apr 18 2009 	Crown Plaza-Always a pleasure	Crown Plaza in Delhi is always a great pleasure to stay in. It has good restaurant, good rooms and good location."
36,1622,"Apr 18 2009 	Excellent for a long business stay	I stayed here for almost 3 months. The hotel is one of the best that I have come across in New Delhi. It has all the modern amenities that are required for a business hotel. The property is crunched for space, but that does not make the place less attractive. The food is very good, variety is low but access to resteraunts in the shopping center next door makes up for this. The fare has risen in the last few months, but corporates do tend to get attractive discounts especially for long stays."
37,1622,"Mar 22 2009 	Crowne Plaza Delhi is way better than what you get in the States	After and exhausting day touring Delhi it was nice to get some peace and quiet. The restaurant and bar were very nice, but really expensive. The breakfast buffet was really good, everything is geared toward Japanese and Western tourists. The service is amazing and rooms were very comfortable."
38,1622,"Dec 21 2008 	Reasonable business stay - India style	After 4 visits to Delhi, this has become my hotel of choice three different times- due to my company budget policy- around $200.The recent Indian currency depreciation helped- so 9,000-10,000 rp now translates to just $200 vs. over $250 6 months ago.Positive:Hotel management responded to my complaint- at the manager's reception I was upgraded to club room with less noise.Certain issues:1. Short power outage, happens several times a day, even in the lobby- after terror attacks, I was kind of alerted.2. Avoid connecting room- noise from neighboring room is too loud- I heard the cough next door all night long the first night.3. Flush noise from toilet- you are out of luck everytime your neighbor flush the toiletIt is really important you know which room to check-in, completely different experience.....Food: Chinese restaurant serves typical European-Chinese food, not interesting for Asians, especially Chinese people at all. Tried once reluctantly after invited by fellow Western travellers. Chef was trained by Chinese chef before.Indian food- 'seven' is great- my favorite : Prawn CurryNew club room is okay with flat screen, which visually enlarged the room. Better than InterContinental Grand, feel safer than Le Meridien.... Payment- be careful about DCC conversion, which adds 2-3% on your bill in $. Took me several months to ontain refund , check clearly when sign, insist on paying in local currency.Location is not ideal- only close to Humanyun's Tomb and Purana Qila, good to visit, plus Lodhi Garden for a relaxed afternoon- no way to get a taxi back...."
39,1622,"Nov 22 2008 	Nice hotel poor location	Decent typical international chain hotel with large, clean and well equipped bedrooms and bathrooms. Nice bar and restaurants. There was a Goan promotion at the Seven Restaurant during my visit and the food and ambience was excellent. The main problem is the location, with nothing to attract close by except for a large shopping complex. The surroinding area is quite filthy and the hotel is some distance from both the cultural centre of Delhi and the international airport (over half an hour - a full hour in busy periods - from each)."
40,1622,"Oct 28 2008 	Good hotel for a busy city	Hotel rooms in India are expensive but in this hotel you receive exactly what you need after a busy day in the city (clean rooms, bathroom, comfortable bed, international TV channels, internet, etc). The food of the Indian restaurant in the hotel is very good. The buffet breakfast has a lot of choices both asian and western.The restaurant staff was very friendly."
41,1622,"Oct 1 2008	Very Comfortable	Anyone who has been to Delhi knows that it's hectic...well this hotel will give you a pleasant retreat.All the staff were very helpful and courteous and even those you just passed in a hallway would always smile and say hello. The cleanliness was good in the rooms and around the hotel. I only noticed an odd smell once lurking about the hallways on my floor and I couldn't decide if it was a rather unpleasant cleaning fluid, something more human or a mixture of both! Food wise they have a very good Chinese restaurant on the 7th floor that has views over the city. It's pricey compared to what you could pay outside but the food does come in large portions (one dish would probably fill you up). They have a 24 hour cafe/restaurant on the ground floor which serves Indian and Continental dishes. For those that fancy a real break from the deeply tasty Indian dishes, or if you just fancy a midnight snack...they rustle up a good plate of fries which are great sandwiched between some butter naan! This cafe also doubles up as the breakfast room in the mornings where a decent buffet breakfast is served up with a good range of Indian and Continental. There is a small coffee shop in the lobby that sells cakes and pastries which are as tasty as they look. My final word on food, is that as far as I can see and from my experience, it is safe and clean. I was travelling with approx. 25 people and nobody got ill.The rooms are of a decent size and comfortable. The first time I stayed I was in a standard room which was absolutely fine. However, if you have a little extra cash, definitely go for a deluxe room. Slightly more space, flat screen TV mounted on the wall, lights and air con (plus a few other things) can be controlled from a small touch pad next to the bed and your own iron and ironing board in the cupboard. All the rooms have tea and coffee making facilities, two small complimentary bottles of water and an in room safe.There are some gift shops on the floor below the lobby and an outdoor swimming pool on the 1st floor. I didn't use either but the latter I wish I had if only there was the time!Location wise it is very close to the Lotus Temple and there are some shops and an ATM if you take the exit behind the hotel then do a left. Currency can be readily exchanged at the 24 hour desk in the lobby.I liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again."
42,1622,"Sep 14 2008 	Great Hotel surrounding area not so good	Great hotel with good service overall. The rooms are well equipped but on the small side. Tried out the 2 restaurants - the top Chinese restaurant was very good although quite pricey for India standards - the bottom one was not all that great on the food, seems to cater more for buffet dinners. Staff generally very helpful. The pool area was a bit small and lacking but then who goes to Delhi to stay by the pool? Not much in the surrounding area except small shops and restaurants."
43,1622,"Aug 6 2008 	Better after moving to a deluxe room	We first booked two superior rooms through their website and requested a non-smoking room. However, when we checked in, we got a smoking room, and one of the room was a wheel-chair accessible one, which we did not ask for.We then changed to one deluxe room. The room was nicer, and at the end of the hall so maybe a little bigger. There was a king size bed but because we were three of us, we had to pay for 2 extra persons. I don't understand why this was so because we only asked for one rollaway bed, which at first was a separate mattress on the floor! We refused to accept the mattress and asked for a proper rollaway. If they are going to charge extra, why should we have to sleep on the floor!Service at the front desk was polite and efficient. They guided us well with all our inquires. In between, we checked out for 2 days to visit Jammu and they let us keep our extra luggage for free and kept an arriving parcel for us. They brought us a free fruit basked and mini-chocolates in our deluxe room (but not to our intial superior room,)The dinner we had at their restaurant, Seven, was nice. There was a ghazal group singing. It was my parents anniversary so they brought us complimentary cake. Their morning breakfast at Le Cafe was good with variety.Good stay for good service."
44,1622,Jun 18 2008 	Pleasant stay	Stayed here at beginning and end of tour in India booked with Jetsave. Reception area lovely and pool very nice with beds in shade. Unfortunately several swimming lessons for local children held in the pool made it crowded and noisy at evening time when you wanted to use it. Room good with complimentary bottles of water and tea and coffee making facilities All our meals were paid but drinks pricy here.
45,1622,"May 31 2008 	lEnjoyed the Crown Plaza	New Delhi India. Crown Plaza Suyra May 14-20 2008. Eileen Queens,N.Y. My stay at the Crown Plaza new delhi India was a happy and memorable one. The hotel is located nearby shopping areas, banks, resturants local markets ect. . I enjoyed my stay at this hotel for the nice rooms with all ammenties,the pool was great, spa was very good I enjoyed that very much after along day touring. Good relaxation in the evening with three resturant to have dinner, casual an elegant dining in the evening with live indian music, a bar for evening cocktails ect. This hotel has a nice decor to it and is fit for any kind of traveller,for business,tourist,or family vaccations ect. The friendliness of all the staff is kind and careing, from the doormen to the bellhops,the resturant staff . The staff and the managers for the day and night shift was very pleasant and careing. Checking in was very pleasant and checking out was also pleasant. When travelling around the world and staying in hotels it is our home away from home and with a open mind one should make the best of our holiday .I enjoyed my stay and if I should travel to India in the futureI will choose this hotel for my stay. My thanks to all at the Crown Plaza Suyra in New Delhi India. Suyra the Sun shines bright in you always"
46,1622,"May 4 2008 	Not worth the money	The hotel is out of the way from the airport and main tourist areas. According to staff, there was nothing to see within walking distance of the hotel. Rooms were OK, but walls were pretty banged up, and the bathroom smelled awful - a damp smell that would seem to come and go for no reason. Worst part, was getting ripped off for the airport pickup. My room was booked through work, and no one mentioned airport pickup, so when I arrived, I went to the pre-booked taxi stand, paid 300 rupees, got my receipt and headed towards the taxis. On my way there, I noticed my name on a sign from the hotel. He told me the ride was complimentary, one of the services the hotel offers, so I cancelled my taxi. Upon checkout, I questioned the 3000 rupee charge, and was told it was for airport pickup. Staff refused to accept that I was told it was complimentary, and demanded that I pay it. I was with a co-worker, who also heard it was complimentary. Now, I dont even really care about the money, work pays for it, but it is the principle of it that bothers me. I was told it was free, then charged 10X more than the regular taxi rate. That left a bad taste in my mouth."
47,1622,"Apr 15 2008 	A good few days	I stayed at the Crown Plaza for three nights in April. The hotel certainly looks better inside than it does from outside. Since I last stayed there eight years before it has had a big refit. The main open areas are airy and bright, nicely fitted out and while the bar area below reception lacks atmosphere its a good place to meet. My room on the forth floor was good, nicely fitted out with good facilities. Service was very good  I was met at the airport by the hotel car, reception was helpful and service at the bars and restaurants attentive. Breakfast buffet was very good, especially if you like Massala Dosa for breakfast like I do, there was a good selection including omlettes and fruit. The evening buffet was very good and a meal in Seven, the a-la-carte restaurant was excellent. The location is little too far south if you want to get to the central tourist spots in Delhi, but it can be a quick ride if the traffic is good to you, All in all a good stay and based on my experience a good hotel that justifies its rating"
48,1622,"Apr 14 2008 	Large hotel with spacious public areas and decent rooms	My business colleagues booked three nights for me in the Crowne Plaza during a recent business trip to our nearby India headquarters.The public spaces are spacious and flashy, and are intended to impress. My Club level room was large and comfortable. The Club level breakfast buffet was not overly large or varied, but entirely adequate for my needs. I did not personally experience the other restaurants. I did not take advantage of the large pool.The staff was overall reasonably professional. The Club level clerk who checked me in was cold, bureaucratic, and officious, with little sympathy for the late hour and my travel weariness as she demanded every detail of my travel plans. I did not find the Concierge to be very helpful when I inquired about taxi options for local travel.There were a number of tour groups staying in the hotel. From my observation, they seemed reasonably content with the hotel.Since I had a free Sunday during my visit, my colleagues arranged a car for a visit to Agra and the Taj Mahal. Round trip from the Crowne Plaza and back, with three hours for touring and lunch in Agra, took thirteen hours total with normal Sunday highway traffic conditions.There are a number of shops in the lower lobby area of the hotel. In addition, there is a small commercial area just off the hotel property with an assortment of Indian and Western restaurants and shops of varied quality. Use your &quot;street-smarts&quot; if you venture into this area.Overall, I would stay at the Crowne Plaza again, mainly due to its convenient location near my colleagues' work location."
49,1622,Mar 8 2008	Don't go there - it is a waste of money	The only thing which is 5star at this hotel is the price. We spent a few days at the Crowne Plaza and we really regretted it. The service is bad. Food is not good. The hotel has a problem with the air conditioning: at restaurants and in the lobby it is very cold. In the rooms it is not possible to have a normal temperature: either you switch on the AC and its cold or your switch it off and it is getting too warm.The waiters in the restaurants are slow. It takes ages till you get served (tea arrives after the breakfast is done).As said above - we cannot recommend to anybody to stay at this hotel - especially not to families with children!Generally an unpleasant place! We didn't like it at all.
