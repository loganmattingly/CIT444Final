27,2229,"Aug 19 2007 	Great value	The four seasons in Shanghai may not live up to the standart of its bigger sister in New York, however she is great value. The price Vs. performance, is far better than in NY. It may not be as stylish and more of a &quot;buissiness interior&quot; But its clean, modern and very well run. If you are picky when arriving and inspecting your room, the friendly staff does anything to help you to be satisfied.We had a room at the top floor witha fantastic view overlooking the superelevetad highways, scyscrapers, superconstructions and the buzz of this supermetropolis. For us the locations was just great. 5 minutes to all major attractions by taxi. Not like the &quot;Regent&quot; where we stayed for the first night. That was far out of town, and thats why we changed to the Four Seasons.The spa area is superb, with a superb pool and superb service.Breakfast rich, however a bit factory like. But hey! its a BIG hotel and the food served for breakfast was great.I would book it any day again if i get a good rate."
28,2229,"Jun 30 2007 	Horrible Experience - Stay at another Hotel	This hotel was terrible and the service was bad at best. The location is in the middle of nowhere, although taxis are cheap to get around in. Also, they served me raw chicken in CHINA!!! We were sick for days. They did apoligize, but the apologies certainly seemed empty.Also, we did a wine and cheese night and the staff had no idea what the wines and cheese were. The night was a debacle and again, we got apologies. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The management did not go out of thier way to help our situation either, even the upper management of Four Seasons. Trust me, you don't want to get sick from raw chicken in China. If this was a 3 star hotel, maybe this would be okay, but when you pay for the best you expect the best! Don't stay here!"
29,2229,"Jun 22 2007	Clean lovely pleasant hotel	I have nothing bad to say about the Four Seasons Shanghai. I wouldn't say it was utterly spectacular, but it was a VERY pleasant stay in a lovely hotel; very nice, attentive staff, incredibly clean, cozy, modern rooms, and a wonderful breakfast buffet. But it's very obvious once you step inside the hotel that they are mainly catering to a certain clientele - business men! They're everywhere. Like a freaky Magritte painting, men in business suits are all over the place. The lobby is small and sparse. I do however, have to compliment the incredibly kind front desk staff. Not one hitch during check-in; in fact I informed them that my husband would be arriving before me, and he had no problems obtaining a key even though the reservation was under my name. A bit on the pricey side, so we only stayed one night - but a very memorable stay over all."
30,2229,"Jun 17 2007 	Our Favorite In Shangha	This is our favorite hotel in Mainland China. We have stayed here five times and each time we enjoyed our visit. There is an attention to detail we do not find at other hotels in this country. The warm service, the perfectly maintained and clean surroundings, the lovely rooms and the outstanding food. This is not to say this is a perfect Four Seasons, but compared to other Chinese Hotels, we find this property in a league of it's own.Rooms. We have tried the cheapest to the suite and prefer the Premier Room. It is very spacious and luxurious. There is a nice dressing area plus a good sized bathroom and a seating area. Some have fabuluous views. Service. Our first visit, three years ago was a bit rougher than our last visit this spring. They have really put together a great staff. They have a warmth you often don't find on hotel staff in China. Last visit they did the check in, not at the front desk but in our room, plus they usually send up a basket of goodies for my son.Upkeep. So many Chinese properties start to look run down quite quickly with chipped paint and stains, etc. Not here. It is all just like new.Food. Lovely breakfast with terrific service which has improved. Dinner service at the restaurants this last trip was not up to the standard we experienced previously.Location. Not as good as the J.W. Marriott, but worth the walk. Much better than anything in the Bund."
31,2229,"May 11 2007 	Should not be a Four Seasons	This Four Seasons hotel did not live up to the Four Seasons standard which is usually great, so it was not good value for the money paid. FIrst of all its location is poor, not near Bund nor Old City, or shopping (to get there it's a 15 minute walk through a poor area). It's a 20-minute walk to the Shanghai Museum, but the hotel itself borders a traffic area with crossroads and overhangs. It is not near the Bund nor Pudong.The room was clean but small for Four Seasons standards, the lobby was loud and even the fountain was not a soothing presence but more of a rushing river that only added to the comomotion. Not a good value for the money spent, unlike other absolutely wonderful Four Seasons in Hong Kong for example. But in Shanghai, opt for the Hyatt in Pudong for view, location, ambiance and luxury. The Hyatt bars and restaurants which we visited were excellent and there were plenty of choices of restaurants there."
32,2229,May 7 2007	first class	I am setting in the lobby bar having my morning coffee. This place is spectacular. First class accomodations and first class service
33,2229,"Feb 5 2007 	Beautiful Property Quite Central	This is a beautiful Five Star property in the center of Pu Xi, the Western (and livelier) part of Shanghai. In case you need to say the name of the hotel in Chinese it is Si Ji Jiu Dian. Although there are no malls or lively street life nearby, it is only really a 5 minute cab ride away from a lot of diifferent attractions. The rooms are very tastefully decorated and don't have that look of wear and tear so often present in Shanghai hotels. I stayed only one night, I wish I could have stayed longer!"
34,2229,"Dec 23 2006 	I Lived Like a King at the Four Seaons	When we were in Shanghai, we stayed at the Four Seasons for a little over a week and spent another 3 nights at the Intercontinental. Both were rated as 5 star hotels but the reality was, the Four Seasons just wiped the floor with the Intercontinental in so many ways. It was no contest.First things first, the location of the Four Seasons in Puxi was perfect. Situated far away from the crowds of Nanjing Rd but within a comfortable walking distance to Huai Hai Rd (and Xin Tian Di), I could not think of a better location in Shanghai that offered a better insight into the city. This area had character. It was more than just the glass and concrete high-rises, the chaotic crowds, the insane traffic and the general hustle and bustle that is Shanghai. You had the restaurants and night markets along Wu Jiang Rd, the high-street fashion of Nanjing Rd West, the modern but pleasant shopping strip around Huai Hai Rd (unlike Nanjing Rd East) and the more eclectic nature of Puxi rather than the staid and clinical air of Pudong.If you enjoy exploring a city on foot then this is the place to be. The nearest subway station is also a stones throw from the hotel if you get sick of walking everywhere and taxis are dirt cheap if public transport is not your taste. Pudong is nice but I felt more at home and welcoming in Puxi.We stayed in a regular Superior Room and didnt have the luxury of being upgraded to a deluxe or premier room but it didnt matter  it still felt like heaven. The rooms were ultra clean, the service was impeccable, the staff were friendly and helpful and the facilities were top notch. My missus works in the hotel industry and she is uber-critical when it comes to accommodation. Even she had a hard time faulting the Four Seasons Shanghai. I made use of the business centre and was highly impressed with how everything was setup (except for the slower than usual broadband internet connection) and the gym and pool would be the envy of any paradise tropical resort. It honestly felt like we were on a second honeymoon if it werent for the fact that I was actually in Shanghai for work.I highly recommend the Four Seasons if you can manage to get a better deal than the burn-a-hole-in-the-wallet rack rate of 3,300 RMB. Otherwise, you would expect nothing less than being treated like royalty if you had to fork out that sort of dosh. This hotel was the highlight of my stay in Shanghai."
35,2229,"Dec 8 2006 	Spacious excellent service and one of the best hotels in china	This is one of the best Four Seasons I have ever stayed. The service is amazing, the rooms and bathrooms space are amazing. The space compared to the other 5 star hotels in China is incredible."
36,2229,"Nov 21 2006	Great gym	For the wonderful name that the Four Seasons has, I thought the rooms and hotel were just adequate to nice. It's a nice hotel, but not fantastic or exciting. I will give it the highest rating as having one of the best gyms of any hotel I've been to. Also, the bar was pretty lively with a really cute singer!"
37,2229,"Nov 11 2006 	Should be called the Two Seasons?	A major disappointment after our stay in Hong Kong at the Ritz Carlton! Although we had arranged a Club Room, at check in, which should have taken place in the club lounge, we had a somewhat cold reception from an incompetent employee. Having been told our room would not be ready for some time despite it being about 1345, half way through the process we were abruptly ordered to the club lounge where everything we had been told to that time was reversed and we were then taken to our room. Disappointment would have to be an understatement! I thought we were at the wrong hotel- was this the 1 1/2 Seasons? Very small rooms, spartan by comparison with other sister properties, and the basic &quot;lemon&quot; decor, of a very low quality did little to make up for the view of the cooling towers of the adjacent shabby high rise we were staring into some 15 metres away out the window! Have you experienced that sinking feeling when you have payed top dollar for what should be a great room only to be greeted with a property that is more in keeping with a basic business hotel in Wuhan? Further, having highly recommended the Four Seasons chain to my &quot;well to do &quot;,but frugal friend, I was acutely embarassed! The &quot;limp&quot; fruit bowl thrust abruptly through the door a few moments later did not improve my feelings about the place. The staff had little English, seemed poorly trained and almost unfriendly. Such a contrast to the excellent Four Seasons Singapore which I love. The lounge was ok; again better English is needed and the Stalinist attitudes need to be reviewed. I could not help but feel there needs to be more &quot;hands on&quot; by the manager and better training all around. This is not the Four Seasons as most of us know it. The surrounding area is uninteresting and seemed miles from anywhere. The concierge was helpful with print outs of areas of interest.I could not help but think that a number of &quot;generic&quot; hotels looking all much the same had been put up in this area of Shangahi, and the Four Seasons had picked one up to get a foot hold in Shanghai. Whatever, the brand is not represented well by this property, and the hotel to us was a big disappointment, particularly aftger staying at their properties in Singapore and Hong Kong. I gather they are building a property in Pudong- let's hope it is better than this place!For the money, there must be much better in Shanghai, but would someone please let me know where it is!"
38,2229,"Oct 24 2006	One of Best Hotels I have stayed at	The best way to sum up my experience at the Four Seasons in Shanghai is to say this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I have stayed at many Four Seasons and Ritz Carltons, etc., but this hotel exceeds all others. The facility is new, so the rooms, etc. are all in excellent shape. The food is excellent, but what truly distinguishes this hotel is the service. The staff at the hotel cannot do enough for you, and truly treat you like royalty. After making the long trip to China, there is no better place to get over the jet lag than at the Four Seasons.The location of this hotel is great as well. You are walking distance to museums, shopping and restaurants and just a short cab ride to the bund. No negatives, if you are going to Shanghai, can't go bad staying here..."
39,2229,"Sep 29 2006	Lovely Lobby	This hotel is lovely from the moment you walk in. My room was elegant with a beautiful bath. Very clean room, excellent laundry service and lavish buffet breakfast. Very nice little hotel shop too. The business center is small but nice and I never had to wait for a computer. I felt very comfortable here. It has a relaxing atmosphere which is welcome in such a large city."
40,2229,"Aug 27 2006 	Excellent!	Everything about this hotel is true 5 star quality. We stayed for 3 nights in a Premier room (60 sq. m.) with a king and a cot for our teenager. Requested and received a high floor view. Room, bathroom and all fittings and fixtures were immaculate. Airport pick up service was great as was check in. Food is spectacular in the main cafe restaurant. Had the evening buffet one night and thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Location is close to Nanking Road with interesting side streets and local restaurants. The Four Seasons will not disappoint and in my opinion is even better than Four Seaons Singapore, which is also a great hotel. Don't hesitate to stay if you can afford the slightly high rates."
41,2229,"Aug 14 2006 	Fabulous Hotel!	Our stay at the Four Seasons in Shanghai was fabulous, we traveled with our family including 2 children ages 10 &amp; 11 yrs. The kids loved the pool and swam everyday! The staff is very friendly and concierge spoke exellent English. Be sure to have the concierge write on a card where you would like to go in Mandarin then you can show it to a taxi driver, they have these nifty cards with a map on the back that made traveling around the city very easy by taxi. The buffet breakfast was great, as well as the other restuarants in the hotel. Be sure to check our #580 Nanjing Lu Road for ALL of the shopping knock offs, if you don't see what you want just ask, much is in secret rooms in the back (hidden from officials). Be sure to visit &quot;Cloud 9&quot; top of the Grand Hyatt 87th floor for good views! We will definitely come here again, and you can not go wrong staying at the Four Seasons!"
42,2229,"Jul 7 2006 	Great Asian hotel	This hotel is the best in China that I have encountered. Very nice and large rooms with good spa facilities. Chinese restaurant is excellent and breakfasts are wonderful with a great selection. Food is varied enough that I did not become bored with selection even over a multi-day stay. Best of all is the service level. I became ill and the concierge found me an excellent English-language health clinic. Other aspects of service are also excellent. I find the neaby neighborhood interesting (in contrast to some other reviews) since a little bit of &quot;old Shanghai&quot; remains, with a few block walk, which is fast disappearing throughout the city. Overall, the 4S in Shanghai rates with the best hotels found in Bangkok, Singapore and Hong Kong. I have been there twice and look forward to returning."
43,2229,"Jul 6 2006	Nice but rough around the edges	I stayed at the Four Seasons Shanghai for a week in late June while my husband attended a conference. I think his company booked almost the entire hotel, as our group of over 400 had the run of the place for the week we were there. We might have overwhelmed the staff, since the service was a bit inconsistent, and the food was only so-so at the (admittedly huge) breakfasts, lunches, and dinner buffets. I ordered room service once, and it was a lot tastier than what they served during our meals!I also had several spa treatments, which were pretty inconsistent. The pool was amazing though--I quickly established a daily ritual of swimming right before breakfast every day. The hotel is nicely decorated, and the staff is eager to help if a bit rough around the edges. All in all, doesn't live up to some other Four Seasons, but its off to a good start."
44,2229,"Jun 18 2006	Wonderful Service but so-so location	Fabulous service especially if you include Club Floor privileges. They greet you at curbside ( I had ordered a car from the hotel) wisk you to your room and check you in there. Rooms are great..bed was very comfortable..bathroom very luxurious. Club Floor was terrific..you can have them make dinner and other reservations. You can even checkout there. Great wine, 2 computers for your use and good breakfast and cocktail hour. A great place to start out your visit to Shanghai. While centrally located there is nothing interesting to directly walk to within a block or two from the hotel. Surroundings are a little dumpy. And everything that looks like 2 blocks on the map ends up being much farther. But definitely a good choice for the first couple nights. Much better than the Ritz which has a location too far away from anything but designer stores...why go there..we have those in the US. Also the Ritz has a very bad, huge covered entrance..with many tour buses etc. J. W. Marriot has a better location than either of these.Right acoss form People's Park and the Shanghai Art Museum and Katheen's 5 restaurant...all great. I did not go inside the JW but it looked good from the exterior."
45,2229,"Jun 7 2006	Fantastic Hotel	I just returned from a three night stay in this fantastic hotel (May 27-30, 2006). Service was superb, rooms were spacious and very comfortable (Premier Club room), Club Lounge was very comfortable &amp; efficient with excellent choices for breakfast and great selection of drinks in evening (as well as appetizers). Location was good (closer to Bund than Ritz Carlton), with a nice (long) walk to the Bund. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Shanghai. The hotel went beyond my expectations and I've stayed in many fine hotels around the world. After departing the hotel and arriving in Beijing, I realized I'd left music CD's in the room. I emailed the hotel to see if they could ship them to me in Atlanta...they offered to overnight them to my hotel in Beijing, free of charge. Excellent choice in Shanghai. Also highly recommend Jean Georges for a splurge dinner in Shanghai. The view of the bund and across to Pudong with the light show at night is spectacular."
46,2229,"Jun 4 2006	Great Hotel	An oasis of calm, luxury and comfort in the heart of Shanghai. Everyone from bellman to the spa staff are polite and helpful. The rooms offer all of the comforts of home - bright open spaces with a great view of the Shanghai skyline - wonderful as the sun goes down and the lights come on.Want to arrange something extra special? Call on assistant concierge Tristan Huang for all of your needs - a delightful person and true professional - to make it happen."
47,2229,"Jun 3 2006 	fantastic four seasons	Just back from a business trip to Shanghai and loved the Four Seasons Hotel. Room:I was in one of the Superior rooms which was very large by European standards. There was a king size bed, widescreen TV &amp; DVD player, an armchair, internet connection, excellent clothes storage &amp; still plenty of free floor space to move around in. The bathroom was also very big, immaculately clean with a brilliant shower. Other nice touches included the complimentary L'Occitane toiletries (refreshed as quickly as you used them), the bathrobes and the slippers. Breakfast:It was buffet style &amp; had pretty much every conceivable style of breakfast food you could think of ordering. Everything I tried was good. We had 1 meal in the restaurant (the Chinese one - there are other styles available), and though not the best meal we had, was pretty good for a hotel.Location:Regrettably, I didn't have time to do as much exploring as I would have liked, so didn't get a great impression of the lie of the land &amp; where the hotel was in relation to other sites. It seemed central enough though - you could walk to the Bund in 30 mins &amp; there were interesting markets and stalls in the near vicinity.Service:I'm usually a little scepical about service, and would be of the attitude that the most important thing about a hotel is the room. It has to be said though, that the staff at the Four Seasons really do go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. All staff, without exception, were very polite, any requests I made were dealt with immediately &amp; there were some other nice touches such as complimentary water and fruit in the rooms.Gym:I didn't use it, but one of my colleagues said it was the best he'd ever seen in a hotel.Price:I paid around EUR 100 a night (excluding breakfast) - amazing value for the quality of the hotel for anyone with a European perspective.Overall, I whole-heartedly recommend the Four Seasons."
48,2229,"May 15 2006	A haven of calm	My wife and I spent three nights here in May 2006. We ended up getting upgraded to an executive suite, which is always a nice way to start a stay. The executive level on the 37th floor provides a lounge with free breakfast, nibbles in the early afternoon and cocktails in the early evening, as well as two PCs for internet access. Rooms. The room we had (admittedly a suite) was spacious, and had two important features: a really excellent shower (with good water pressure) and a very comfortable bed. The Chinese seem to go in for very hard beds in even their luxury hotels, and so this was a relief in that it was an excellent matress - extremely relaxing to sleep in. The TV was OK rather than gigantic, and the level of furnishing was of a good standard. The room was maintained very well. Also, bedside lighs were of good quality and so allowed reading in bed - frequently a problem even in expensive places.Laundry - though I ticked the &quot;ordinary&quot; box (next day service) this came back within four hours!Si Ji Xuan restaurant (one of six in the hotel). This did good quality dim sum at a very fair price (around GBP 10 for plenty of food and tea). You can find better in Hong Kong or London is you search it out, but this was nonetheless very good. We also tried it for dinner and had a pleasant meal: good Sichuan prawns though a rather ordinary Beijing duck (go to the Grand Hyatt in Beijing for this) but certainly a very pleasant meal. Service: Excellent at all stages in our experience: friendly, competent. Pool and spa. There is a very pleasant indoor pool (though no view as such) on the fourth floor. The gym is of a very good standard, with plenty of cardio machines and a reasonable range of weights, including free weights. There is just one rowing machine which I never could figure out the settings of. Machines mostly have little TVs which you cna plug headphones into and wathc while you exercise. Decor: there are some nice art deco style touches e.g. the 37th floor lift area, though overall this is an America busness hotel, so the style is tasteful rather than very stylish.Location: conveniently near the French quarter, which has a delighful pedestrainised area with bars and restaurants (e.g. the excellent T8 restaurant) popular with expats. It is a few minutes taxi ride away from the Bund, and doesn't have a particularly spectacular view (go to the Grand Hyatt in Pudong for 87th floor views). Perhaps a setting on the Bund would be better for tourists, but this is certainly not inconvenient. Overall, a very good stay, and I would be very happy to return."
49,2229,"May 11 2006	Four Seasons saved our trip tp Shanghai!	We moved to the Four Seasons having checked out after one day from the Grand Hyatt (see my review to know why!). The FS is everything the GH is not. Discrete. Calm. Welcoming. Well-located. First the location. An earlier reviewer commented negatively on the neighbourhood but I couldn't disagree more. The neighbouring streets offer a very interesting insight onto Shanghai life away from the high-rise and always felt safe to us. Plus it is a five minute walk to the main metro line (which runs to the Maglev terminal, if you're travelling that way). The hotel is also on the edge of the French Concession which we found to be the main area to go at night for restaurants and during the day for shopping. We had booked a Premier Room but, after a bad experience at the Hyatt, asked to see the room before we checked in. They were very patient and showed us two rooms before me made the choice. The room was a very good size with an interesting view back towards the downtown area - beware, however, as I heard someone in the lift complaining that their room overlooked a building site on the other side of the hotel. I can understand those reviewers who complain that the standard of fittings in the room just isn't up to the luxurious standard expected from a FS. The cupboard doors and drawers were very thin and poor; the tv was small; and the room generally just didn't seem to have enough furniture in it. But it had everything we needed, there was plenty of space and the bed was wonderful.Service levels in the hotel, while not quite up there with the FS Hong Kong, were a welcome relief from the standard Shanghai brusqueness. Do go to the Chinese restaurant for a dim sum lunch - the lady who served us was delightful, talked us through the different choices and their sauces and kept our tea cups constantly filled! As we had just decamped from the Hyatt this lunch - a mere 15 pounds a head - calmed us down and assured us we had made the right decision. Special mention also to Helen the concierge who arranged everything from restaurants to train tickets efficiently and helpfully.This may not be the best FS in the world but it must surely be one of the best hotels in Shanghai. This is not really a city for tourists and even the FS was mainly filled with business people. Yet the atmosphere was so much more congenial and relaxed than the Hyatt and the location for sightseeing is unbeatable. Stay here and you won't regret it."
50,2229,"May 6 2006	Loved It	Stayed here for 5 nights in March and I loved it. Excellent service all around and with great L'Occitane products for use. Concierge was very helpful when needed and hotel is pretty close to Xiang Yang Market, Xian Tian Di, Yu Yuan Gardens, Nanjing Road, etc. I would definitely stay here again in the future."
51,2229,May 2 2006	An oasis in Shanghai	We stayed 4 nights at the Four Seasons on the 30th floor in a Center Suite. We were upgraded from our reserved Executive Suite. The room was wonderful with every amenity that you would expect from a luxury hotel. The service is incredible and we looked forward to the welcome back greeting every time we returned to the hotel. The concierge staff handled all our plans without a hitch. It could not have been better. Breakfast at the Studio Cafe was elaborate and delicious. The Four Seasons is an elegant retreat in hectic Shanghai. We couldn't have been more pleased with our choice.
52,2229,"Apr 30 2006	A very nice business hotel in Shanghai	True to the Four Seasons brand, this is an excellent hotel to stay at on the Puxi side, very centrally located and not too far from anything. The rooms are very nice, the bathrooms have L'Occitane products."
53,2229,"Mar 20 2006	Great hotel with excellent rooms	Stayed two times in March'06. Excellent rooms with great views. Great breakfast buffet with fresh orange juice (a rarity in China). Great facilities, including spa. Very convenient location close to People's Square and the French Consession."
54,2229,"Feb 19 2006 	The best hotel I have every stayed in	I work in corporate travel and have been fortunate to stay in some great hotels throughout the world. The FS Shanghai is probably the best hotel I have yet stayed in. From the moment you arrive, you are treated with the most wonderful, courteous care and attention and made to feel very special. The room I stayed in was a junior suite and was very generously sized with separate seating area. The bed was enormous and extrememly comfortable with very soft sheets and a quilt. I especially loved the bathroom which had a very deep decadent bathtub and separate walk-in shower cubicle. The complimentary toiletries are by French Provence company L'Occitane and smell delightful. Running a bath takes around a minute thanks to some very powerful plumbing! At the time of my visit I had been feeling unwell and the hotel were very attentive, sending their own in-house Doctor and translater to my room who gave me exceptionally good care. I ate in the hotel on three occasions- room service Chinese breakfast which arrived promptly and was delicious and also a buffet breakfast and brunch in the ground floor restaurant. The choice of food at the buffets was staggering and lovely touches like ice-sculpted swans made it feel very special. If you are going to Shanghai then the Four Seasons is the ultimate in comfort and combined with the wonderful staff and great accommodations I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Absolutely fantastic."
55,2229,Jan 12 2006	Great Hotel - Don't stay anywhere else	Stayed at the Four Seasons 28 Dec 05 for 6 nights. What a lovely hotel. The staff were fantastic. Each time we returned to the hotel we were greeted with &quot;Hello and welcome back&quot; We had a centre suite which was extremely comfortable and spacious. Very large bathroom. Nice little touches such as fresh flowers around the suite. We got a great deal with their &quot;third night free promotion&quot;. The gym was well equipped. The change rooms/spa area was the best I have seen in a hotel. There was EVERYTHING one would need. It is a little further away from things than the Marriott (which did not seem as personal as the FS) but taxis are so cheap it didn't matter. If going to Shanghai stay at the FS. I have stayed at many excellent hotels around the world and the FS rates up there with any of them. Also visit Jean Georges Restaurant at Three on the Bund. - Fantastic!!
56,2229,"Nov 25 2005	Very Nice Hotel Would Stay at Grand Hyatt Next Time	Stayed at the Four Seasons for 2 nights in June 2005. Beautiful hotel, as you would expect from the Four Seasons. The room was huge, had a separate dressing room, and a large gorgeous bedroom. Service was excellent. The spa was wonderful and very reasonably priced. Loved the Western-style buffet breakfast. The only drawback was that the hotel was a bit out of the way. The Grand Hyatt in the Jin Mao Tower with all its great restaurants is obviously &quot;the place to stay.&quot; It's younger and more touristy. The Four Seasons is more mature and private."
57,2229,"Nov 14 2005	Great Hotel	Great hotel. Excellent service, well located to the main attractions. Maybe I expected a little more from the breakfast, but a plus is that it can be served in your room at no extra cost (at least I wasn't charged anything).Hotel is new, rooms are good size, nice bathtubs. I'd stay there again for sure. A downside is that restaurants close at 10pm, but it's like this in all of Shanghai (don't ask me why, I simply can't understand...). Make sure you eat before that!!!Tip - do use the taxis, they're convenient and incredibly cheap."
58,2229,"Nov 10 2005	Sooo Bad! Usual 3 star experience from Four Seasons!	My wife and I went on a Spa package that they offered. We had to carry our own bags as we entered the hotel. Front desk courtesy was poor. The Spa was a awful. The massage was terrible, quality of a 5 year old giving it to you. We contacted the General manager Peter Weber. He never stepped out of his office to talk to us. He gave us a 30 US dollar credit for the bad massage, but he just gave us our money back. At the Breakfast Buffet they had you set up amoung the uncleaned bar from the night before. Also witnessed very unhealthy practices at the breakfast buffet by the employees.1. Waiter digging his hand in the cold dry cereal containers to grab a hand full to put into his mouth. Several times.2. Chef sneezing without covering his mouth in the middle of the breakfast buffet, then touching all hot food chaffing dishes as he visual inspected. Several sneezes/touched every dish.Peter Weber the General Manager never came to visit us face to face as we requested. The hotel is flawed in many ways! Recommend staying at the JW Marriott, better local and great service!!!"
59,2229,"Oct 20 2005 	Getting better as it goes....	The FSS has improved since my last stay there in June. Its service standard has gone up and I am impressed that they treat their return guests very well. The nice touches of remembering my preferrence for Chinese snacks (and not milk chocs), my love for dark chocolates and my need for extra mineral water, etc all these tell me that I should return to FSS again... which I will do so in Fenruary next year!"
60,2229,"Oct 10 2005 	beyond my expetation	Four Seasons in Shanghai is a low-profile luxury kind of hotel. It's a hidden gem. I fell in love with it the moment I stepped in the lobby.It's spotless clean, the flower arrangements are breath taking and the staffs are friendly.

1,2233,Apr 11 2008	Adequate for our needs	Hotel part of the Travelsphere Discover China Tour. Nothing much around the hotel and views from the hotel were of building sites. However planned activities on both nights meant that the location wasn't a problem. Supermarket across the road was brilliant for cheap beer and chocolate. Smoky in the bar area but we were on the non-smoking floor so that was OK.Rooms large and well appointed with all possible toiletries etc.Shower was good
2,2233,Apr 1 2007	Plenty of sunshine in Shanghai!	If you're not after a hotel smack-bang in the middle of all the activity in Shanghai
3,2233,Jan 26 2007 	very nice hotel	I've stayed at Golden Jade Sunshine Hotel in Shanghai in January and I've had a great time. Hotel is situated out of the city centre but I didn't mind that much because taxis are cheap and they can get you anywhere. The neighbourhood is nice and very convenient because there are several supermarkets
4,2233,Aug 17 2009 	???????????????????????		
1,2234,Nov 24 2009 	Wow	The most awesome hotel I've ever seen in the tallest building i've ever been in (99 floors!)
2,2234,Nov 19 2009 	Luxurious quiet and comfortable	The hotels lobby is on the 54th floor which means that the hotel begins on the 55th floor and above. Every room has exceptionally beautiful views of downtown Shanghai. The outside of the hotel reminds me of the Chrystler building in New York. The service is fenomenal. They even have people standing at the elevators so that you do not even have to puch the elevator button. The bar on the roof is awesome
3,2234,"Nov 7 2009 	Disappointing	The best thing about this hotel was the view. The worst was the service.The pros were (apart from the view) the attractive well equipped rooms, Cloud 9 bar, the buffet breakfast and the pool and leisure facilities. The restaurants were also pretty good albeit the food in the grill arrived in Chinese style - the side dishes some time after the main course! The cons were the service and the cramped smokey public areas. The reception area was particularly cramped and the reception staff somewhat unfriendly and unhelpful. The bar at the bottom of the impressive internal atrium was also rather poor; it lacked any atmosphere and had a bad odour of stale smoke and old food. Unfortunately, this smell drifted up to the rooms on the lower floors. The constant noise from surrounding building works was also a detraction; whereas this was not the hotel's fault, given the prices charged for the rooms, I would have expected to have been advised about this when at the time of booking (during our stay the building works were 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) and, whilst the noise did not keep us awake, it detracted from the overall experience.All in all, an attractive hotel in a reasonable location with decent rooms but service falling far short of what I would expect of a 5 star hotel and far short of the service in the much superior Grand Hyatt in Beijing. In a word, disappointing."
4,2234,"Nov 7 2009 	What a great hotel one of the worst front desk	I stayed at Grand Hyatt with my wife for 2 days.The location and the room was one of the greatest I have ever stayed.When I came to the front desk for check out,they told me that the hotel stay was not paid for the company and they had to draw the amount from mycredit card.Although I know it was paid but unfortunately forgot the voucher,I authorized them to do this action.When I was back to Turkey,I checked my documents and the action was made 2 times which was already paid by yhe company.It is really a shame for Grand Hyatt and I would like to warn the trip advisor's readers for this hotel.Please be very careful.Ali Ergen,M.D.Ankara,Turkey"
5,2234,"Oct 24 2009 	Grand hotel service not the best	Great location and nice hotel, but unfortunately the reception staff are not very flexible. I had a small issue with my reservation and I ended up arguing with the front desk for over 10 mins. At no time did they offer me any alternative solutions or try to accommodate me. When I tried to escalate the issue to a more senior manager, it took more time. When travelling for business, time is of utmost importantance, so to have these types of issues is unhelpful. Stay at the Shangri-la - a much better and more welcoming hotel."
6,2234,"Oct 13 2009	5 star all the way incredible food incredible view incredible room!	This was the highest hotel in the world when we visited in May, standing where only 15-20 years ago, would had been rice paddies! The room was very large with beautiful wood and art thruout. The bathroom had a most interesting layout with glass wall on one side and sliding teak doors across from a WONDERFUL shower and jacuzzi tub.The bar in the room was inset across from a mirrored wall and looked and felt rich and well appointed. From the hallway/balcony you could look down to the lobby as if you were in an incredible whirlpool of art! The food was incredible- a bountiful buffet of gormet selections in a dining room offering an unsurpassed view of the city. This hotel comes highly recommended! The service was superior."
7,2234,Oct 11 2009 	Staying in the clouds	An amazing experience. The hotel lobby is on the 54th floor! Views to the city and river are great from all angles. They have a great lunch time business menu on the 54th floor. Have a drink o the 86th (or as it 88th?) floor after dark - great views.Rooms are very luxurious and the bathroom great. Try showering on the 75th floor next to window!Service was 100%
8,2234,"Oct 8 2009 	Expensive luxury in one of the highest hotels in the world.	We stayed for six nights during the Total Solar Eclipse on July 22, 2009. (Sadly, the eclipse was rained out. :()We upgraded to the club level, and got a room on the 83rd floor with _stunning_ views of the Pudong river and surrounding city. Club level was an extra $120/night, but the amenities almost made it worth the cost.I'd give it an Excellent rating, but the construction in the area really made it hard to get around.Club level also gets you access to an exclusive lounge that serves an upscale continental breakfast, afternoon tea and sandwiches, and an open bar during cocktail hour. The food was an assortment of small snacks, but they were of top quality. (My girlfriend still raves about the smoked salmon she had for breakfast every day. She said it was some of the best salmon she'd ever had.)The room was of a decent size. The bed was a little hard. The 42&quot; LCD TV was nice. The bathroom was quite opulent, with both a shower, and a large tub. Maid service was invisible and efficient. All of the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.The downside is that the entire area around the hotel is all torn up with construction, in preparation for a world's fair on 2010. The access tunnel to the metro has been closed during construction, and it's a long walk to the next entrance. The riverside opposite the hotel (the Bund) is also completely torn up, further reducing the quality of the view.I would definitely recommend this hotel - especially if you can get a package price on the rooms.I think the one downside of the hotel is that it's so high up that you feel kind of isolated from the city. (It would have been perfect for the eclipse - if it hadn't been overcast. :) I think the next time we visit Shanghai, we'll get one that's closer to the pulse of this vibrant city.Oh, and I picked up a computer virus on my USB memory stick from their PC in the business center. :)"
9,2234,Oct 1 2009 	worth it just for the view and the bathrooms!	was the tallest hotel in the world when we stayed there. rooms and floor to ceiling windows overlooking windows. restaurants and bars very chic. walking distance to pearl and aquarium.best bathroom EVER..
10,2234,Sep 3 2009 	Has to be one of the nicest hotels on the planet	This hotel exceeded my expectations eevery time. In all the years I have been staying here it has never been anything but amazing. I always am able to get the same suite and at almost $3000 a night it is a great value. The staff remember my name and are always very helpful. Can t go wrong with the Hyatt grand
11,2234,"Aug 31 2009 	Beautiful hotel..	I was very impressed with the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai, the hotel itself is beautiful and the location is very good with breathtaking views. Drinks in the bar at the top were very enjoyable. Service, as at most of the Hyatts I have stayed at, was of a very high standard. Will most likely return to this hotel this October when I go back to Shanghai."
12,2234,"Aug 22 2009 	Very modern but not very comfortable	The tower is very stunning. The view from the lobby's quite amazing on a clear day. The Cafe, the Piano bar or the Chinese restaurants all share this amazing view of Shanghai from high up. Just I don't like to stay there. Too much waiting, both for an elevator up to the lobby, or at the very crowded taxi stand. Too many 'outsiders' (non-residents) here and there. Changing elevators is simply troublesome. The decor's modern but too cold. The hotel staff's generally arrogant and unhelpful. It's definitely good but I expect more from a Grand Hyatt."
13,2234,"Aug 16 2009 	Impressive views from an impressive hotel	Great modern rooms, great views on the city and the river, excellent service"
14,2234,"Aug 13 2009 	Very Solid Trendy but too cramped	My third stay here. Not sure why I keep coming back (perhaps just for the Hyatt points?). Great views when not cloudy or smogged in - so try and hit on one of those 5 days each year. As the hotel is in a tower, the common areas are quite cramped. The bar on the upper levels (85F?) is good, but they have not managed to keep the working girls out - which suprised me for a hotel of this repute. On the upside the guest rooms are great - very modern. Hard to walk anywhere from this location - so need to take a car/taxi. Overall - good for business; would not rate this for a holiday stay."
15,2234,"Jul 12 2009 	Great but not as nice at the Park Hyatt next door.	Stayed one night after returning to Shanghai and before heading to Hong Kong. Very nice, clean, modern. Staff was pleasant, but not anywhere near the level of service as at the Park Hyatt we stayed at earlier in the week. The Grand Hyatt is bustling, very busy both in the evening an morning. Ate both dinner and breakfast in the lobby area restaurant. Quality was fine, but it was very active. Like being in an airport. Service in restaurant was just OK. Similar experience at check-in, not bad, just to the point.The layout of the room and the view were great. The view from the tub and shower were amazing. Decent selection of english language TV to distract me while I was using the internet connection. Very comfy bed."
16,2234,"Jul 6 2009 	Standard luxury hotel - met most of my expectations	The Grand Hyatt Shanghai has now been usurped by its newer and taller sister hotel, the Park Hyatt. However, the Grand Hyatt is still a very good hotel and one of the best in Shanghai. We booked 2 rooms for a total of 4 nights. The check-in desk is on the 54th floor, and we (my family and I) were given adjoining rooms on the 77th floor. I asked if we could have a river view room, and we were upgraded without hesitation to fantastic rooms with view west towards the Bund and the Pearl Tower. Despite this, except for one waitress in the restaurant on the lobby level, the staff at the hotel did not appear to be warm and friendly, as we had experienced at our hotels in Beijing and Lijiang. The hotel is stunning with comfortable rooms and big bathrooms overlooking the city. Although the hotel is located in the newer Pudong area, access to the other side of the river is quick and easy by taxi as the hotel is located by a couple of cross-river tunnels. Taxis are also cheap and plentiful. The bar on the 90th floor is expensive and over-rated in my opinion. It felt a little cramped. Instead, I recommend the lounge at the base of the atrium on the 56th floor. There is an excellent buffet breakfast with a range of cuisines to choose from. The hotel has great views in every direction, and is very comfortable in a good location with good professional staff, even if they are a bit robotic. Nice spa and swimming pool on the 57th or 58th floor and a very good gym. The fact that it is in a stunning building high above the city with magnificent views gives it an edge over the other luxury hotels in the city. Good bathroom amenities and excellent housekeeping, concierge services etc. My only gripe is that we were charged US$8 to wrap a souvenir. The fact that I was to be charged was not made clear to me when the concierge offered to do this. On this occasion, I felt that I was being &quot;nickel &amp; dimed&quot; by the hotel. Nevertheless, I would definitely stay here again."
17,2234,"Jun 25 2009 	Grand Perfection	The Grand Hyatt Shanghai is a spectacular property with amazing service and extraordinary facilities. Even if the Park Hyatt (just across the street in the Shanghai World Financial Center) is aiming to surpass the Grand Hyatt, I strongly believe in many ways this particular property will remain at the top of Shanghai 5-star hotels. While the Park Hyatt has more of boutique-hotel feel (= smaller), the Grand Hyatt is, as its name states it, truely grand, with its renowned 35-story high atrium and extra classy decor.For my own stay I booked a &quot;Regency Club&quot; room which I highly suggest yo do if you are considering this hotel. Club rooms are the best : they are located between 72nd and 79th floors (my room was on the 79th) and come with plenty of perks providing a top-notch luxury experience all around. It is really worth spending this premium (approx. 100 $ / night), considering the extras that come with : free in-room internet connexion, exclusive access to the Grand Club (83rd floor), complimentary afternoon tea, evening cocktails and continental breakfast (all at the Grand Club). Take note that the evening cocktails come with plenty of tasty food, which can easily replace a dinner.Upon my arrival at the hotel, as a &quot;Club&quot; guest, I was quickly directed to a separate check-in counter located at the 83rd floor. Everything ran smoothly and my luggage was carried up to my room in the process. I need to mention that the staff at the Club floor are more than helpful and professional : they know (and remember) your name, they are always smiling and polite and speak very good english.My room itself was grand just as the rest. Was I lucky or is it just the way all Club rooms are, but mine was actually very spacious and very neat. Room furniture is both very classy and efficiently designed, with small touches everywhere to increase your comfort level (eg.: room lighting can be controlled on two consoles besides the bed). Bathrooms are remarkable to say the least.I have tried two bars at the hotel during my stay : the Patio Bar (56th floor down the atrium) and Cloud 9 (87th floor). Both were nice yet very pricey. However, I was a little puzzled to be approached twice by a &quot;massage&quot; lady offering me &quot;a lot of beautiful girls&quot; at the Cloud 9 bar. I guess it can just happens everywhere here in Shanghai ?The pool / spa facility (57th floor) is stunning and perfect in every aspect. Certainly the best hotel pool I have seen until now.Location is a minor con (which can be a plus depending on your travel style). Pudong is generally soulless and very business-oriented, giving you more of a Wall Street feel which has very little to do which the real, lively Shanghai. Or course, all the major attractions can be reached by metro from Pudong (short ride), or by cab but be ready to spend a lot a time in traffic congestion at rush hours. However, the Grand Hyatt is just a short walk away from the fantastic park that lounges the Huanpu River.All in all, Grand Hyatt really delivers and fully deserves its 5-star award."
18,2234,"Jun 22 2009 	Stunning Hotel but not worth the money	Stayed for two nights at Grand Hyatt Shanghai while on business. First off, the hotel is stunning to look at and the attention you receive from the staff is unparalleled. Upon arriving at the hotel lobby on the 54th Floor you are greated with a stunning 20 feet glass view overlooking Shanghai. I stayed in the regular room and chose not to opt for the more expensive VIP floor (higher floor, internet access and breakfast buffet). The room itself was beautiful complete with glass and marble bathroom. Everything was perfect in the hotel. Now the negatives: Shanghai is hosting the World Expo in May 2010 and there is a tremendous amount of construction going on outside the hotel Although you can not hear the construction (as you are on the 60th floor), traffic is terrible. Getting to and from the hotel is a nightmare. I expect it to get better when the constructions are complete (sometime in 2010) but until then, expect to wait in traffic. Second thing, the hotel is beautiful but expect to pay for it. It is incredibly expensive for rooms, food and drinks. If cost is not an issue, then stay. But if you are cost conscious, then you can expect to pay above average for the stay. My stay at the hotel cost me about $750 USD for 2 nights. If you are willing to accept a local brand hotel and a non-prime location, I think you can find much better value for your money in Shanghai. All in all, a great experience. Would I come back? Probably not, I would find comparable properties and save a bit of money."
19,2234,"Jun 20 2009 	Beautifull View	I really enjojed the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai. The room was so commodious. At night you had to think twice, wether you go to the toilet in your room, because the way was so far ;o). The service was incredible, i needed some business cards and the woman at the counter even translatet it for me in chinese. At the next morning i had my new cards with an english and a chinese side. The buffet breakfast hat a great choice and was very delicious.The view over Shanghai was very nice, because we had a nearly clear sky."
20,2234,Jun 16 2009 	Great hotel but with construction all around....	Loved this hotel. We had spacious rooms overlooking Pearl Tower with good bathrooms and toiletries and complimentary chocolates.....great buffet breakfast. Great choice and delicious. Staff very friendly. Spa/fitness ok. While the height of the building is an obvious attractions smog and concrete dust seem to spoil views most of the time. Showpiece cocktail bar lacked atmosphere and was very pricey. Walking anywhere around the outside of the hotel involves crossing building sites and dodging iron girders and incredibly you can hear drilling from the 60th floor.....
21,2234,"Jun 13 2009 	Very Good	In Shanghai for only 5 days at a conference. The Hotel was excellent other than a plumbing mishap which was dealt with well. The conciege staff could not have been more helpful. The breakfast was great and the meal at the Club Jin Mao, the setting and service were great though tradiditional Shanhainese is not to my taste! Would have liked more time to explore the city and would recommend the hotel to all."
22,2234,"Jun 10 2009 	Great Hotel	it was great experience to stay in shanghai and with Hyatt ,it became one of the best tour i have been. It was nice to be in Hyatt with family And i am sure you will love it,with family ,friend , or with anyone. i like the way they handled costumers and their amazing service . i have no word for that two day i spend their . from me Hyatt is best hotel in shanghai."
23,2234,"May 31 2009 	Small Rooms and pricy but it is the tallest hotel in the world	Worth staying here if just for the experience of staying in the tallest hotel in the world. The rooms are small with very small double beds. Their Italian restaurant I can highly recommend excellent food with a view and a price to go with it. Their canton restaurant was disappointing. The food was bland and there was no dress code, shame for such a class of restaurant. The service in this restaurant was also rather lacking, not being allowed to order our choice of food! The waiter would not allow us to order a starter and a main course that both contained chicken!"
24,2234,"May 24 2009 	May be my best hotel experience ever!	The Grand Hyatts I visited recently in China (Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong) combine excellent service with a relaxed, feel-at-home atmosphere that I find greatly appealing. The Shanghai property is the best of three excellent hotels. The hotel itself is stunning inside and out - especially the lounge on the 56th floor. The staff was universally terrific - friendly, attentive, professional, especially in the Business Center. They convey the sense that they really appreciated my presence and that they enjoy their work. This was an unbeatable combination for a weary business traveller. The room was comfortable, quiet, and luxurious in an understated way."
25,2234,"May 11 2009 	Great View	I stayed in this hotel foe one night. From my room, I can see the river, and the beautiful city, the view is really nice at night with the lights in the city, and I was lucky enough to see a 5 minuts fireworks on the river that night.But the room is quite small, and it is bouble bed size.... the funiture is bit worn down, and the TV is the normal one, not the flat one.The foods are quite nice, I had a free breakfast the next morning.Didn't have chance to use other facilities. It seems to be the middle of the business center, so, it is close to everywhere, guess the location is good, and that is why it is expensive"
26,2234,"May 8 2009 	Great view	DIdn't stay in hotel but ate in Canton Restaurant on 54th floor and drunk in CLoud 9 bar on the 89th. Can't find Canton in your restaurant section. I compliment the restaurant on its excellent food, only the wok-fried prawns were a slight dis-appointment and it is very reasonably priced given the location and view. The same can be said of Cloud 9 where prices are reasonable high but not outrageous and there is not an over-use of ice in the cocktails, as experience elsewhere in Shanghai."
27,2234,"Apr 28 2009 	Stylish hotel great service	Was there for conference at nearby convention center, liked the hotel for its location, style, view, and deco (combination of old chinese charm/deco, with modern furniture, and facilities), the staffs are very friendly. Great view of the city from room, lounge and restaurants. highly recommended."
28,2234,"Apr 18 2009 	Fab hotel in Shanghai	been to shanghai before but never got the chance to stay here. so, when i get back last march, an opportunity arise, booked this place and stayed for 2 nights. very posh place to stay. romantic if u are staying with a partner/spouse.highly recommend this hotel for a pleasant holiday/business."
29,2234,Mar 28 2009 	Fantastic experience	One of the greatest hotels in the world.Fantastic view form our 73rd floor spacious king room. Excellent restaurants with excellent quality and variety of food. Excellent breakfast.The staff very polite helpfull and professional.
30,2234,"Feb 16 2009 	Great Location	The Grand Hyatt in Shanghai is a beautiful 5 star hotel with one of the most exciting views of the city.The Jin Mao tower is worldwide famous, since the hotel has been for ages the highest hotel of the world. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom is beautful with the bathtube and the shower looking at the skyline from a huge window.The Grand Hyatt is a little bit old style hotel, at least if you compare it with the newly opened Park Hyatt Hotel just on the other side of the street, but it's still worth a visit!The service is excellent, the food average (and should be improved).You can manage discounted price in groups."
31,2234,"Feb 11 2009 	An excellent experience	Stayed here for 2 nights in a queen room on the 64th floor (6411). The room was of ample size, though not extraordinarily large by any standard. With the design of the building it looks like this is probably one of the smallest rooms they have. From looking at the map on the door it looks like they have a variety of rooms of different sizes. Everything about the room was very good however I would say it is starting to show a little age. The TV is not a flat panel and overall the room had a little worn feeling to it. Still it was very clean and everything worked properly. In room internet was 5RMB a minute with a 120RMB max for the day. The service was excellent. The staff were very nice and very attentive trying to help me whenever they could. Both check-in and check-out went very smooth. I would say the only disappointment, which is certainly out of the hotel's control, was that between the fog, haze and pollution the view was really not that great. Everything seemed quite gray this time of year (February). The other thing to consider is the location on the Pudong side of town. Without much traffic it's a quick taxi ride to the Puxi side of Shanghai where most of the tourist, shopping, dining areas are. With traffic it can take quite a while. The metro station is about within walking distance and that will get you across the rive in just a few minutes. If I can get a good rate (mine was 950RMB+various service charges, taxes) then I would definitely stay here again."
32,2234,"Jan 17 2009 	Pleasant Stay Overall	I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai for 3 nights in Jan 2009 for a conference held at the nearby Shangri-La hotel. I'd been to the amazing 88th floor bar before, so expectations were rather high.Check-in was easy, and the cab driver new exactly where the 'Jin Mao' building in the Lujiazui district of Pudong was (don't ask for the Hyatt, there are like 4 Hyatts now in Shanghai). I and my luggage were whisked quickly up the elevator to the lobby.Check in was quick and efficient, despite there being several people waiting. From there it was a quick ride up to the room. I got one of the 'triangular' rooms, which was fine. I however, like other commentators, found it very complicated to use the infrared desk lamps, which I honestly think should be replaced with lamps with an on/off switch. The room seemed somewhat overdesigned to me, but I did think the closet that was accessible from both sides was genius. The bathroom was great, but in the middle of winter I decided to have a soak in the bath and I must say the water had a rather musty smell to it, but that may be less the fault of the hotel than of the water supply.I thought the food in the cafe was excellent. The hotel does provide the foreign papers in the evenings on request. Everything worked beautifully for me and the service, really, was quite amazing. I even got an email from a concierge yesterday telling me that I'd left a T-shirt in my room and had asked me for my address. Incredible.Departure was similarly effortless. I think for a hotel of its size it does an amazing job at personalizing the experience, and ensuring that guests do feel welcome."
33,2234,"Jan 1 2009 	A Great Stay...	This was a quick trip to Shanghai...just a couple days. I had some extra points in my Gold Passport account so I decided to upgrade to a suite (paid rate for the room and then 6000 points for the upgrade) - and I am glad I did! The room itself was amazing. As a little background - we were doing this trip partially to celebrate my partner's birthday. So the suite was part of his present. I emailed the hotel concierge a couple weeks out and mentioned the trip was to celebrate a birthday. In turn, they arranged for a car to pick us up at the airport, a suite on the 82nd floor (85th is the top floor!) and, to top it all off, a birthday cake in our room for him upon arrival. VIP Services met us when the car pulled up to the door and we were taken directly to our room to check in. Check in was quick and efficient - they had everything they needed with them and just validated my credit card. They were even able to accommodate our 3pm checkout request (6pm flight) without any hassles.Room was very well appointed. They classed this as a &quot;Junior Suite&quot;. With the design of the hotel, every room is a corner room; so there are windows everywhere. As one other reviewer pointed out - at that level the views are somewhat hampered by the smog but they are still quite fabulous. We were able to overlook the river, the Park Hyatt (next door) as well as well across the river into the city. Starting from the entry way...you walk into the room to find yourself into a nice sized hallway. Not like many hotels where you feel &quot;crammed&quot; as soon as you walk into a room with closets and such. Here, you have a nice open entry with a table to place your stuff on. From there, a nice small mini-bar area with coffee maker, tea set and nicely stocked bar. You can also enter into a more private closet area just off the bathroom.The sitting room has a nice sizeable working desk, comfortable couch and flat screen TV. I measure the quality of a foreign hotel by the networks they offer - and the Hyatt gets 5 stars (CNN International, BBC, MSNBC, as well as HBO, Showtime and others). The desk had a built-in converter for our US-based plugs so we didn't have to mess with the converter we always bring with us. To top it all off - free internet (although it is not free on the lower floors). The only thing is it isn't wireless (which in this day and age seemed kind of odd to us)...but there was a cable provided in the top drawer and we were set.The bedroom was also very comfortable. The mattress was a little firm for my taste - but not bad. Once again, nice large windows and another flat screen to watch a little TV. The in-room safe is part of the TV credenza. While large enough to hold our camera, passports and wallets, it wasn't big enough to store a laptop. One each bed table there was an individual alarm clock as well as controls for the entire suite's lighting fixtures. The lighting (to me anyway) was a little difficult to grasp. We are not talking simple light switches here...everything was electronic. Each &quot;panel&quot; had an on/off switch, as well as the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Over time, I figured out 1 was bright, 2 was medium and 3 was low. Once I figured that out, it was then remembering what panel did what :)The bathroom was also quite nice. The tub was right up against the floor-to-ceiling windows (!!) but the privacy shutters (full-out wood) offered the privacy you would want. There was a separate shower with rainfall and full-body nozzles. We learned the hard way that the full-body nozzles, pointed the right way (or in this case the wrong way!) will cause water to leak out onto the tile floor. Not a big deal but just something to watch for. Finally, you have direct access to the closet area (which leads then back into the main entry). My only concern here is that it was a little dark. With all my searching I really couldn't find a light switch to make this area a little easier to see in. They offered plenty of hangers (at least a dozen!), slippers, robes and drawers.As for the staff...well, there are plenty of them! Everywhere we turned there was always someone holding open a door, pushing the elevator button, clearing our plates...one thing the Hyatt is not lacking is people. But it wasn't overwhelming. We had drinks one night in the Executive Lounge on the 83rd floor. A nice spread of alcohol and snacks. The view was of the same vantage point as our room, so we didn't see anything new from here. We had breakfast both mornings in the main restaurant off the lobby (52nd floor). While a tad on the pricey side ($30USD each) for breakfast, nonetheless the food was quite good. They had a great collection of local dishes, as well as Western food. All quite fresh...I always saw someone replacing something or refreshing one of the stations...goes back to they have plenty of staff.For Dinner, we went to the Jin Mao Club on the 86th floor. Highly recommended that you make a reservation as it can get quite busy (as we encountered) with a &quot;smart casual&quot; dress code (we went in jeans and polos and they were fine with that). The food was amazing. We had a mix of seafood and traditional Chinese dishes and everything was very tasty. The menu was a little large (2 pages, 8.5x11) and somewhat daunting. But, it also offered a very comprehensive description of what you were ordering so it helped. It offered items as exotic as shark fin to as simple as chicken. We went middle of the road with dishes containing shrimp, chicken, scallops, vegetables and rice. Everything was served in traditional Chinese &quot;family style&quot; so you didn't have to reach over and grab something off someone else's plate just to try it! And while the table is set with chopsticks, the staff will bring you a fork if you ask :) The price point for two people topped a little over $100USD without alcohol.Finally, in regards to the location. Yes, there is a lot of construction in the area (looks like they are building a &quot;W&quot; hotel next door). And yes, the local subway is about a 10 minute walk away. But the walk is quite pleasant (and easy)....just head out the front of the hotel, turn right, go down to the police station (2nd light) and turn right again. Keep walking and once you hit the circular traffic stop, you are there. So what I am trying to say is - it isn't as big a deal as what some of the reviewers may have led you to believe. Kiddy-corner to the subway is a very large (6 or 7 storey) shopping mall. Mainly upscale, but there are bargains if you look. And for those who need a coffee fix, this is the closest location for a Starbucks to the hotel (3rd level, below the Best Buy).Since this is a hotel review, I won't get into a deep review of the shopping. All I will say is, it can be quite an experience. Be prepared for people to just approach you on the street to try and sell you a watch, shine your shoes (or in our case, they wanted to shine our tennis shoes!) or beg for money. In a couple instances, children would run up and grab onto our legs begging for money (with their parents standing to the side)....they wouldn't let go unless you gave them some money. So either try and stay away from them with a quick side-step, or keep a couple $1 coins handy to get them off of you.All-in-all, a great place to stay. Definitely worth what we paid for and definitely a city we will go back and visit again."
34,2234,"Dec 29 2008 	Older than the new Park Hyatt across the street but worth a stay.	This is a great property located at the top of Jin Mao tower in the Pudong area of Shanghai. Location was great for business but if I had to do it all over again I would've probably stayed at Hyatt Regency on the Bund as that is the nightlife center of Shanghai.Checkin was, with any Hyatt in Asia, a pleasure and the views from the Sky lobby were fantastic (less the foggy-smoggy Shanghai is now known for). Elevator and corridor design was very asian with great pieces of Chinese art on display. The view from the guestfloor balcony to the atrium was incredible. Guestroom was semi-suite in size with great minibar and extremely comfortable bed and bedding. Bathroom was a nice size with bathtub overlooking the skyline. Amenities were plentiful and the shower was a pleasure to use.The only drawback was the somewhat dated appearance of the furniture and tube TV. For the rates we paid there, I expected a 42&quot; flat panel.If you can't stay at the new Park Hyatt across the street, I would stay here. John NYC"
35,2234,"Dec 27 2008 	A great hotel	I spent three nights in early December at the Shanghai Grand Hyatt. It is quite a nice hotel, and is described as the highest hotel (in terms of distance from the ground) in the world. From the entrance at the street level, one goes up the elevator to the 54th floor reception lobby to check in. (Below that is the office space). My room was located on the 58th floor, which was relatively low. (The top floor for guest rooms is 85th, and on 86th and 87th are a restaurant and a bar, respectively). My room was of decent size, though not particularly spacious. Decorations and fittings were all very nice, especially the bath room, which had an additional door that opened to the wardrobe. This is a very clever design. The bathroom had a tub as well as a standup shower area right next to it. The shower consisted of three adjustable shower heads arranged vertically to each other and aimed at the upper, middle and lower parts of one's body. The shower was also very powerful, just my kind of thing.On my first night there, I had a quick dinner at the Italian restaurant. The food was good but nothing exceptional. Breakfast the next morning was also good, but not as nice as that in the Beijing Grand Hyatt, my favourite hotel in the capital of China. I didn't try any other restaurant in this hotel on this trip, although a few years ago I had had Chinese lunch and Japanese dinner there. Both were good, but quite expensive. I did take a brief tour of the patio bar on the 55th floor. It's main attraction is that you can look up the 33 floors of atrium that spirals all the way up to the top of the building. It's a breathtaking view, a little sci-fiction like. But I suspect the effect will be more dramatic if it is lighted in blue rather than yellow.I have to say that I was very disappointed at swimming pool, which probably measured only 20 meters in length and three meters in width. Not only was it rather small, there was nothing special about its design or decoration, just very plain and ordinary. I did expect something better from a great hotel located in China's second tallest building."
36,2234,"Dec 23 2008 	World Class	This hotel is stunning from the outside and the inside. I upgraded to a Bund View room and ended up on the 72nd Floor. My room was massive, and hard as I tried I couldn't find fault with it.The views are stunning, the furnishings classic, the bathroom is fantastic.Yes its expensive, but then Shanghai is, and for the equivalent price you'd be hard pushed to find a comparable room in London, New York or Paris.Didn't get the chance to try the spa etc (working!) but am sure they are as good."
37,2234,Oct 31 2008 	Wow	Awsome hotel. My room was small but as a solo traveller it was fine. The bathroom was absolutely fantastic. View was spectacular and breakfast although pricy was sooo good.On the negative side I could not find that it was really walking distance to anything but taxi in Shanghai is not that expensive anyway.
38,2234,Oct 30 2008 	great!	Excellent hotel. This is the best service you could get in China. The highest hotel in the world has incredible views of the most &quot;occidental&quot; city of China.
39,2234,"Oct 15 2008	Great hotel	Amazing hotel for an amazing city.We had 2 interconnecting nonsmoking rooms on the 70th floor. I am not great with heights but got used to it!The views are spectacular and a real bonus. Hotel feels like a penthouse oasis from a city which feels like a chinese Manahattan.Staff and facilities top notch, architecture a real bonus. Breakfast sensational."
40,2234,"Oct 9 2008 	Very good business hotel	This is a good business hotel, made more interesting by being so high up (used to be the highest in the world before the Park Hyatt next door opened). We liked it, the restaurants were good, the gym is really great. We changed rooms because the standard one was actually pretty small/poor layout, while the next size up was a significant improvement. We liked it."
41,2234,"Sep 26 2008 	Very impressive	Spacious, quiet rooms. Hyatt Club lounge peaceful and mercifully free of television. Helpful staff speak good English."
42,2234,"Sep 8 2008 	Great views of.....smoggy skies	My secretary booked the hotel for a business trip. I really don't get what the infatuation with these sky-high hotels when the visibility outside is horrendous. The room was dark and made worse given the desk lamp didnt work (despite multiple requests for it to be fixed). Vicinity is good for business, but nothing else is nearby. Construction makes a 3min walk to the subway take 20mins. My colleague stayed at the Jia hotel on the Puxi side and loved."
43,2234,"Aug 24 2008 	Spectacular	We stayed here for 4 nights and could not fault it. The room, the service and the food were all 5 +star. Being in Pudong,the view from our room on 73rd floor was spectacular and there was no need to go to any other observation towers.[--]"
44,2234,"Aug 19 2008 	Awesome hotel with professional staffing	I stayed at the suite of the hotel and it was a great stay. The room is comfortable, big (with living room, corridor leading to the bedroom, so it feels like a one bedroom apartment) and clean. Bathroom is also nicely sized with all the necessary toiletries and LCD tv for the bath. Bed is comfortable. Staff was friendly, spoke English well and professional. Check in was speedy. Everything was just great. The hotel is not that close to any attraction sites (closest mall is about 15 minutes walk away), so that's the only downside, but the hotel which is located in the Jin Mao Tower (2nd tallest building in Shanghai) is an attraction itself, that you can go up the tower to get a good view of the whole city.Overall, highly recommended!"
45,2234,"Jul 31 2008 	Expect the Best	Beautiful views / service / rooms / food - Everything you would expect from a hotel with this reputation - Pure luxury. The spa treatments are also excellent, I had the hot stone therapy. The worst part is the extreamly long elevator ride to the bottom - enough to give you a serious head spin ;)"
46,2234,"Jul 29 2008 	Sublime	This hotel is surely one of the most unique hotel experiences in the world and we enjoyed every minute of it. What other hotel has such sublime sky high rooms or has a pool on the 57th floor or a bar on the 88th floor?Our family of two adults and two children had two connecting hotel rooms on the 71st floor for four days in July 2008. These rooms were huge, super luxurious and comfortable with outrageous views. This room combination cost us around $AUD600 ($US570) per night, so this hotel is no place for people on a budget. The hotel is very opulent and like most high quality hotels in Asia there are staff everywhere and they are extremely polite. We found both the service and the facilities to be exceptional. The pool and spa areas are fit for a king. The concierge can only be described as expert and dramatically improved the quality of our days out and about.In summary, I cant really understand why some other reviewers have been critical. I suspect that this is the result of two main reasons. Firstly, the cost could be a bit painful for some and expectations may have got out of hand. Secondly, some of the triangular shaped rooms in the hotel may not as good as the majority of rooms. Look at the floor plan on the back of the room door when you arrive. I am sure the staff would happily move to a more suitable room if you were not happy.Two tips for travel in Asia which are relevant for this hotel:There is no need to be demanding, just ask politely and you will always get better results. Also better service is received by those that dress appropriately. Shorts and T-shirts arent always winner in high class establishments."
47,2234,"Jul 28 2008 	What a view!!	This is truly an amazing hotel with Jinmao concert hall attached. The lobby is on the 57th floor, so you'll be stunned by the views during check-in (if it's not cloudy). Then up to your room, we opted for windows on 3 sides and couldn't have been happier. Of course this was booked with Hyatt points, so $125 for 2 nights upgrade was an easy decision. The garden tub has a huge window overlooking the Bund and our room overlooked Pudong, the Oriental pearl TV tower, the river, and across to the Bund. We had clouds the first day, but when it cleared on the second day I took most these pictures.Meals were OK, but don't expect alcohol in your drinks at Cloud 9 on the 87th floor. Note that the view from the bar is way better than the tables they tend to seat you at, but the appetizer food is pretty good.Breakfast is cheaper ala carte, and the buffets looked great for those who can eat that much food.It's a good hotel for walking the tourist tunnel across to the other side of the river, up the Bund to People's Square and DO NOT MISS the Shanghai Museum! Definitely the best overall explanation of China's history, art, and life with views of People's square from the second level tea house inside the museum. I could go on about Shanghai, but know that staying in the Grand Hyatt JinMao tower is an experience and the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Way above my expected standards!"
48,2234,"Jun 7 2008 	Good Service Good Facilities Good Price!	After a long journey for a package trip, we decided to stop over at Grand Hyatt before leading back home.It's our first time to stay this hotel since it was opened. It's a majestic hotel, good service, new facilities and good place for business meeting.Just to compare our experienced with the other hotel . In this hotel, I noticed that the staffs are more attentive if they meet a foriegn guests compare to the local guests. Is it because of the tips? For me, If the staff give me a good service then, I will give them some tips.But I noticed that they didn't even greet us when we enter the restaurant.They gave different level of service, but we pay the same price."
49,2234,"May 18 2008 	The best thing about this hotel was leaving it.	We just spent a few days in Shanghai and thought we'd spend the last night at the Grand Hyatt taking in the view. I booked us a club king room thinking it would be nice to sip a few cocktails with my husband. I still can't believe what a doozy and complete waste of money this hotel is. The vibe is so unbelievably bad. Within an hour of being in our room which had a crappy, disjointed view (wall splits the room in half and takes up most of the view) I was in a bad mood and couldn't really put a finger on it. In the end i realised that the design of the room is so bad that i felt like i was in a box somewhere rather than a supposedly good hotel. My husband arrived a few hours after me and commented that we'd clearly been given a crap room. Anyone who wants to book at this hotel (and i really wouldn't recommend it) should avoid the hyatt's own website and call for a room. He too couldn't get out of the room quick enough which kind of defeated the purpose of staying there. The fittings in the room are cheap, cheap,cheap though they are designed to look like luxury. The bed is not in line with the tv and the tv was some old one stuck in a cheap cabinet and you had to swivel it to see it. This may sound petty but when you're paying US$500 /night for the privilige i think the least they can do is put in a flat screen directly opposite the bed. The bathroom looks ok but again is made of cheap materials so the doors close badly and with some effort. There are too many taps in the shower and most of them squeak like the cheap taps they are.I had to call for an iron and ironing board and when it arrived it looked like it had been taken from a formula one hotel that had been closed down!The club lounge was the worst I've ever been in. The food they served with the 'cocktails' in the evening was inedible. I love food and will eat almost anything particularly when I am starving, which i was. I would seriously advise against paying any extra for club access. The view from that room is also nothing special. The service is bad and they've tacked it on the wrong side of the building.The best thing about this hotel was leaving it. Seriously. I was in a much better mood within 20 minutes of checking out. We spent a few nights at the Regent before hand and the rooms were fantastic. Immaculate, incredibly well thought out, comfy. A lovely big flat screen that you could watch from bed or from the bath (just slide the door along) and great views. I can't believe we left!Shanghai rocks!"
50,2234,"May 16 2008 	Good but not great value	My wife and I decided to round off our trip to Shanghai,part business,part pleasure by staying at this icon of the new Shanghai. Pudong, the neighbourhood, is fascinating and a real glimpse into the future. China is normally excellent value but at GBP211.00 for a riverside view with few extras was not great value. Yes, the room was spotless,yes the staff were politeness personified and the views were spectacular.And yet. With the exception of an excellent bathroom (watch out your neighbours can see you!) I've stayed in Holiday Inns with more soul and bigger rooms to boot.Special praise,however, must go to the Piano lounge.Very atmospheric,low lighting, great house band and top service albeit with hefty bar prices and a minimum spend tariff."
51,2234,May 15 2008 	it is expensive	expensive!!!!Great!!!
52,2234,"Apr 4 2008 	Eye Candy	Location: Perfect! we had planned the first part of our Shanghai stay to take in everything in the Pudong area... Aquarium, Bund, Oriental Pearl Tower and of course, our hotel. No need for a taxi and you can't get lost - just look up, it's currently the tallest building.Pool: Three sided views, clean and for the first time ever in all our years of hotel pools- they had a Liifeguard!Lobby: bit confusing as up and down elevators are on opposite sides of the front desk. Views are spectacular. We stopped a number of times to just look out the windows.Concierge: Very patient and helpful. Lobby Level Restaurant: Just okay. Served European and Asian foods in a buffet.Room: Small but loved the layout. With a hallway entrance it created a great and often needed seperation from the outside. Did not hear a peep. Very glad they had their A/C working as many only have it on by season not outside temperature.Bathroom: Design of the bathtub allowed your neighbor on the corner a pefect view in if the blinds were not closed tight - and then of course there are the year round window cleaners we waved at! This was not an Oooh Aaah space. Nothing special,If you can't stay here, make the lobby level a destination just to take in the views. Amazing day or night."
53,2234,Apr 1 2008 	Very Expensive	Hotwl is great but the cost is up 35% from last stay in Jan 2008 yet it was filled
54,2234,"Mar 7 2008	Nice design but below average services and inconvenient location	The best part about the hotel is that it has a good city view. The 33-story atrium showcases architectural prowess. I stayed here in 2006. At that time, customer services were below average and front desk staffs conformed to the stereotype that Shanghainese think they are better than anyone else.Room: Well decorated. I liked the bathroom with large window that could look out to the bund view. Location: Located in the business area so not close to restaurants and other happening areas and you must take a taxi to go anywhere.Conclusion: Nice hardware but below average services and inconvenient location. Will not return."
55,2234,"Feb 10 2008 	thde best re coup from a trip to shnagri-la	We had a fantastic young tour guide, Tony, book out stay for 2600 Chinese Yuan. We came from Shangri-la, which is more rustic than it sounds. Despite our smelly and dishevelled appearance, the staff treated us fantastic! It was great to see the salary men waiting in line to pay their cover to go to the &quot;Cloud Nine lounge&quot; as we walked right past in our jeans and t-shirts. The service was great and the room was a great refresher from three weeks in the bush in Yunnan province. That was the best hotel ever!!! we had some doubts after reading the reviews, but we are forever glad we splurged"
56,2234,"Jan 29 2008 	Majestic but Quirky	I stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Shanghai last November for the second time in 2007. This is an honestly beautiful hotel located on the upper half of what was, until recently, the tallest building in Shanghai. I can assure you that having a room on the 80th floor of any building is eye-opening. However, both times I've stayed there, I've run into a couple of problems. For example, on my last stay, another traveler with the same name as me had checked in just before I did and they gave this individual my room. Not sure what happened to this guy's original room but they seemed to not be able to give it to me and advised me I'd have to settle for something less than what I had booked, as though their error was my fault. While this ultimately got rectified after about an hour, it seemed as though the hotel staff saw nothing wrong with downgrading my room as a result of their error and acted as though my insistence on getting what I had booked was unreasonable. The other thing that (really) bothered me was what I assume was the air freshener they used in their rooms which had an acrid, almost bitter smell that was really annoying. I guess it might have been pesticide or something else but the smell was pervasive and cloying. Not sure I'll stay here again; I think there are enough alternatives in Shanghai so this shouldn't be a problem."
57,2234,"Jan 19 2008 	Best place I've stayed in Asia	Unique hotel - it is new, well designed rooms and amazing views from windows. There was nothing negative during our staying there. Even if it too expensive for you you should try it for one night ))"
58,2234,"Jan 17 2008 	Good but not great	Firstly - like to thank everyone who contributes to this site. This is an immensely helpful resource and does wonders for our search for accommodation overseas!Stayed in the Grand Hyatt in Jan 08 on Level 66. The building is definitely impressive, and being so close to the new Shanghai world financial centre, it gives a great view over the current construction.Re: location, as most of the touristy things are located on the Puxi side, the fact that the hotel is in Pudong can be a little inconvenient. However, from what I can gather, there is a subway station not far from the hotel and it is only one stop to the other side of the river. If you can catching the taxi from the Bund back to the hotel, it costs about RMB 20, which is not expensive at all (careful of the traffic though via the tunnel).The rooms are good, but not great. As noted previously, the lighting could better. Given how new the hotel is, I am surprised that the TV is not a flatscreen. Bathroom is fantastic - massive size with a great shower, and a heated mirror as well.No dispute about the views - they are undoubtedly fantastic (on the assumption that there is no fog / smog that day).Not very happy with the service we received at all. Whilst the staff were in general polite, the service we received were some times to be desired. On one occasion, I was in my room watching television (with the door chain on) and received a ring from the room service staff (even though I didn't order any room service). As I didnt any expect any visitors, I didnt answer the bell. The staff proceeded to then knock on the door, OPENED the door (who then found was chained), and then smashed the door open thus breaking the chain. I could not believe that this would or should happen in a 5 star hotel.Further, during the check out - they wrongly charged us for an orange juice even though we didn't take anything from the mini-bar.Buffet breakfast was excellent with wide range of choices. However, per before, the service is still a little crude and need smoothing around the edges. More training is required.In general, would recommend the hotel for business travellers with their own drivers, but not the best for tourists."
59,2234,"Jan 12 2008	This hotel missed all of its potential	This hotel on the surface is amazing - the highest hotel in the world - ridiculous views on Shanghai. The problem lies 100% in the design and planning. Hyatt should be ashamed at wasting such an opportunity. The rooms are okay - lighting is difficult, the bathrooms are a disaster in design - water is always everywhere - saving grace is the amazing view from the bathtub. The restaurant situation is pathetic - either you go incredibly high end chinese or you're in some faux-fancy food court with anti-ambient sound and lighting. The lobby is set up terribly and once again doesn't capitalize on the views. The good parts were the staff - very friendly and helpful, and the concierge club level - although the lighting could be improved. I wanted to like this hotel because the raw space is great - but what a disaster."
60,2234,"Dec 27 2007 	Amazing!!!	Totally exceeded all my expectations and I can't wait to go back again! I was put on the 78th floor and the gym was located on the 56th floor. Breathtaking views of Shanghai all round and definitely worth every penny! Food was amazing, service was impeccable, the room was super contemporary and more than enough space. The shower and bathtub face the ceiling to floor glass window so not for the faint hearted but for the precious princesses out there who love to travel and be spoilt IN STYLE!! The Hyatt's have never failed to impress me to date and this one topped them all!! You must stay here if you are in Shanghai :)"
61,2234,"Dec 12 2007 	Spectacular view...	We stayed quite short in this hotel but it was for sure memorable...If you have a partner with fear of heights this is not such a good choice because from the halls were the rooms are you can look down all the way..also from the room same thing with the view on the Bund..I loved the view over the Bund from sitting in the bath or taking a shower and relax..The room is pretty and clean with a good bed, spacious desk and coffee and tea facilities and more..We had Wonton soup in the Grand Caf, well do not order more if you try that because the soup was a meal on its own!We had a great time at Cloud Nine on the 87th floor..there was a great magician going to the tables with his tricks and the drinks were good and then I repeat myself I know: the view!"
62,2234,"Dec 11 2007 	Fantastic!	Fantastic hotel! Comfortable, clean and beautiful. Modern with a great view!"
63,2234,"Nov 30 2007 	spectacular	Ok this hotel certainly ain't cheap, but if you can afford it its worth as its pretty unique. We there for a conference for three nights, and had seriously nice room on the 72nd floor. The view was truly spectacular it is quite something else to open the curtains to that kind of view. The room was a very good size, comfy beds, extremely nice bathroom, a sensible work desk as well, only criticism is the lighting was a bit dim with the exception of the bathroom and the lobby. Service was good, as are the restaurants.It has a decently equipped gym although at 57 floors up the window facing cross trainers and treadmills are not for those who suffer vertigo.You can pretty much just live in the JinMao tower complex if you so desire, there are coffee joints etc in the podium block, and even a minimart in basement 3 (this is not easy to find). Externally Jin Mao tower is a stunning piece of architecture. The location is good by Pudong standards - although much in terms of things to do is in Puxi.Worth it if you get the chance."
64,2234,"Nov 17 2007 	Very impressive property	I haven't stayed in many Grand Hyatts to compare but this property is a very impressive one with gorgeous public spaces and the rooms were quite good. I had a river view suite; the club on the 83rd floor is very good with late hours and good food and pastry. Being within 5 minutes walk of a metro stop is very useful; it was easier to get to the airport with the metro and change to the maglev train than it was to get to the hotel by using the train and then getting in to a taxi. Concierge and health club were both good. Views from the rooms are not as good as you'd expect since there are many obstructions in front of the windows and the views from the club lounge are the best anyway, but yeah, get a room with a view as long as you're staying there."
65,2234,"Nov 13 2007 	Great hotel but some quibbles	Stayed here for 3 nights as local work office is very close by. Hotel is located in the upper floors of the JinMao Tower (lower floors being office space) with a small commercial/shopping arcade located adjacent. Also close by is the SuperBrand Mall (Zhengda Guangchang) which has improved considerably since my last visit in February. First impressions were the amount of service staff - people everywhere it seemed, even to hold the doors of the express lift to lobby floor open for you! And a lot of spare staff around lobby area at times. Everything appears very shiny and new. Level of English spoken by the staff (especially desk staff and those answering phones) was excellent. Room was a long corridor leading to the bedroom, with a wardrobe between the corridor and bathroom which could be accessed from either side - nice and convenient. View was great looking directly at the Pearl TV Tower. Used the gym facilities a couple of times. The gym itself is very good, as is the spa and steam room. Though I used the pool and as other users have noted, there is someone there that watches you do laps, and it did weird me out a little. Bathroom was pretty special. Big bath, and a shower with an overhead nozzle and two more placed about a metre or so above the floor, though working out how it all worked was a bit of a comical experience. Lots of marble etc etc. Also had room service one night, which though I was told would take 20 minutes, arrived in 10 and was absolutely delicious, and reasonably priced I thought (wanton noodle soup for about 50 or 60 RMB). Room was well decorated and the wood panelling on the wall with Chinese calligraphy was pretty nice to look at. I think a lot of the other pluses of the hotel are summed up well by other people, but here's what my quibbles were:- Whether it was me or the bed, I had three nights of very poor quality sleep when I stayed there.- Desk lamp, which is activated by waving your hand in front of a sensor, is a joke. Sensor would never work properly. Just buy ones with on/off switches already!- There are about six guest lifts in the lift lobby, and two lift buttons at both far ends. This means that if you wait at the far left, and the lift at the far right arrives, by the time you get to it, the lift has gone, and there's no middle button to press to make it wait (unless there is someone in there kind enough to hold it for you). - For a very new 5 Star hotel to have an Akai Guestlink 59cm CRT TV in the room was pretty average."
66,2234,"Nov 6 2007 	Life is too short	So just once spoil yourself. I rank this hotel as one of the greatest hotel experiences i have ever had. ( we were in the diplomatic suite ) on the 80th floor. I won't comment on the room as most won't use a review of the suite, however if you can afford it. GO 4 it. low season rate was 650 usd per night.The hotel is hugelly impressive and first class in every respect. Security is evident everywhere, cleanliness is apparant and the interior desighn of the hotel is something to be marvelled at.The worlds tallest hotel and highest Bar, well worth having a few beers at just to visit. Even if your staying someplace else.The hotel is very near a subway station and you can easilly commute to anywhere from that point, including under the river to nanjing road. (3 yuen ) The location is also near the super brands mall which in itself is an architects dream and well worth seeing. The hooters downstairs is also a welcome respite for some good old fashion chicken wings and beer.The business lounge at the hotel was great with good service and continental breakfast as well as snacks and treats at supper.Nothing beats a glass of wine on the 86th floor next to a window. WOW.The Cafe restraunt was also very good but i thought the buffett breakfast was a little overpriced considering you could order a la carte for a fraction of the cost.No problems with language, front desk was a breeze, all hotel staff were some of the best ever. carter at the front desk can solve any problem .I will be returning with my family at some point in time and i would never consider another hotel."
67,2234,"Oct 31 2007 	An upper class business hotel	We had a very pleasant stay here. The views were obviously amazing and the rooms were definitely worth the price. The bathroom alone was worth every penny!Rooms were well designed and spacious. Bathroom was huge and had a lovely shower! Beds were extremely comfortable and were kitted out with down duvets and pillows. Our request to provide one set of synthetic pillows was handled promptly and courteously.Location is great if you're here on business and need to spend time in Pudong. Otherwise, if you're looking to explore Shanghai, it's a bit out of the way. The metro is only a short 5 minute walk away, but it means you're having to commute where ever you go.Because you're on the other side of the river, getting across to central Shanghai by taxi can be painful at almost all times of the day. We caught a taxi to the train station just before rush hour and we should have avoided that!Staff were very friendly and helped out with directions. They were, however, unable to help us organise train tickets - something which I would have expected from such a hotel.Restaurants and bars in the hotel were good - although by late evening, almost all bars were teaming with prostitutes who were only too keen to chat you up if you spoke English near them. By closing time one felt practically hunted as they tried their best to make their evening pay. Entertaining to say the least!Even if you don't stay here, I'd highly recommend visiting to see the amazing architecture of the atrium that all floors look onto. A hotel in a building of this height is something special and they've made the most of it!"
68,2234,"Oct 30 2007 	If you're looking for glamour and glitz (and a price to match)...	This hotel is probably deserving of a 5-star rating but I didn't check in until late (past midnight) and I had to checkout to catch a flight early in the morning. The hotel is VERY impressive. The check in counter is on the 54th floor! The are a number of bars and restaurants with the feature attraction being the bar on the 88th floor (I think - I've visited the bar on a separate occassion). The view from the bar is pretty cool too with the city lights et al. The room is large with modern furnishings and a cool/funky designed bathroom and closets. Although, the room lacked an ironing board and iron, which I found odd given how spacious it was. My stay was too short to comment on the hotel ammenities but I will say that it is a VERY posh hotel and if you have the cash to stay there I would recommend you take the plunge, just for the experience."
69,2234,"Sep 19 2007 	I loved this hotel!	This hotel was super! My room over looked the Eastern Pearl Harbor. It is located right by the water front and a major mall! Right across the river is the super brand mall with all the fancy shopping. It is located right in the Jin Mao tower, and the hotel lobby is on the 54th floor, so you have amazing views from where ever you are! Inside the hotel there are cool clubs and great places to eat!"
70,2234,"Aug 13 2007 	Great Experience	I travel extensively for business and have stayed in many nice hotels and this hotel stands up to any of them. I found the service excellent in every regard. The room was impressive and only exceeded by the view. Location was convenient: a quick and inexpensive cab ride from most major attractions. Ate breakfast and dinner in the hotel and both were excellent. Overall, I would recommend this hotel."
71,2234,"Jul 16 2007 	Awesome Hotel - Overpriced for China	The location of the hotel is a far distance from the Pudong International Airport but in a great location within Shanghai. When you enter the hotel, you will need to make sure that you prepare yourself for the 54 story rise to the front desk. The hotel is beautiful with an excellent view for my room on the 60th floor. The room was spacious and clean with an awesome bathroom. I have to say that if I come back for a personal visit, that I would stay at the Grand Hyatt again no matter the price."
72,2234,"Jun 29 2007 	Loved it!	I think it is probably one of the best hotels in Shanghai, and it definitly has the best view! The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is the CANTON restaurant. It is overpriced and disgusting!!"
73,2234,"Jun 27 2007	Left after one night	We debatede for so long as to where to stay in Shaghai. Pudong or Puxi, the Hyatt, with all the great reviews, the Shangri La, the upstart. Well, we ended up staying at both. Why? Because the Hyatt must have what is the most indifferent service in the world. When we made our reservation we requested very specific rooms that a guidebook that we like had recommended. As many other reviewers have indicated we got nothing like what we had requested. The room was small, there was only one sink in the bathroom and the view is not what we wanted or had requested. The rooms, though stylish, looked tired and worn and our friend's room had a horribly stained carpet. When we told them at the club level, where we were, that we were leaving almost inmediately, nobody asked why or offered to help in any way. Their indifference was unforgettable. Club level breakfast was meager. Club level happy hour was much better. Club level is small and gets crowdedLoved the views, loved the architecture and actually for a large corporate hotel, the decor, if spruced up a bit could be just fine."
74,2234,"Jun 23 2007 	Dross	I recently stayed at the Hyatt for 4 nights. It is one of the worse hotels I have visited regardless of the cost. The room was dirty upon arrival (toe nails clippings over the floor, hair in the bath and numerous dirty marks). The decor was about 10 years out of date throughout. The bathroom sound system didn't work, the sink took 15 mins to drain, the DVD player cut out twice and the curtain rail was broken. By far the biggest issue was the incredibly poor staff service. They were useless at everything but expected a tip at every turn - which is not common practice in China. Room service waitor put the tray on my wife's jewellery and still expected a tip. That is minor compared to the sheer rudeness of all but one member of staff. Ostentatious day trippers are treated far better than hotel guests. I suggest you take on that guise."
75,2234,"Jun 18 2007	Excellent hotel 	The Grand Hyatt in Pudong is truely an excellent hotel. The hotel itself is beautiful, comfortable and well-run. The views from the inner courtyard (it's over 80 floors!) rivals the views outside. The building itself is an architectural marvel for sure. The restaurants are excellent - we tried two of them. The breakfast and lunch buffets are incredible - enormous choice. We stayed there for three days and had a great time. The staff is very helpful. The only minor issue might be the location. Pudong, on a good day, is hard to get to traffic-wise from the Puxi side (where most of the sight-seeing spots are). So if you are sightseeing you do spend quite a lot of time in traffic trying to get back to the hotel. But overall, an excellent option."
76,2234,"Jun 3 2007 	amazing views	We couldn't fault the room.a'Grand de-luxe, Bund view', it was huge and truly luxurious. Extremely comfortable. Unfortunately we always seemed to be in the clouds(smog?), but at night time the lights were magical.The hotel itself starts on the 54th floor, which necessitated quite a lot of change of floors and. lifts; a bit confusing at first.The staff were charming and with the exception of restaurant staff, efficient.The buffet breakfasts and lunches were very good.The only complaints we had were with the restaurants; smokers and non-smokers were seemingly muddled up together, quite illogically, so you could get a non-smoking table next to smokers. The reservation system for dinner in the buffet restaurant was hopeless, we reserved a non-smoking table next to the window and when we arrived at the correct time were asked to wait about 10minutes, at which time we were given a very poor table nowhere near the window, with tables of heavy smokers very near.We tried the Italian restaurant there in despair another night, but again had a poorly placed table, though we hadn't booked, so someone had to have it! I ordered a main course of macaroni. It was penne and was truly inedible, very like the flour and water paste that we made as children ,left to harden. I sen it back and was offered salad or 'something else'. My husband had a seafood tagliatelli dish which he said was OK, so, being hungry, I opted for that. By the time it eventually arrived I was past hunger and we agreed that the tagliatelli was only really just OK. He ordered Chocolate Chip ice cream for pudding and the only chips in it were of ice!To add insult to injury, they tried to charge me for the macaroni, but hastily agreed that they had made a mistake. Nevertheless, I was charged 5 yuan extra for the seafood tagliatelli and by this time we had lost the will to argue.I know---Italian food in China-----. However, at the end of two weeks you do long for a change from Chinese meals and an expensive meal at such a grand hotel should have been better."
77,2234,"Jun 1 2007 	Astounding- Gotham City Experience	This is an astounding hotel. Being the tallest hotel in the world you are in for an amazing experience in the architecture, design, views and sheer quality of the place. Other reviews have said it all. Its a must visit. Getting into the Clouds bar at night can be tricky (so popular) but worth persisting and experiencing the Gotham City feel..its expensive, as you would expect but worth it."
78,2234,"May 29 2007 	Number one in Town	One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I stayed at the Grand Hyatt twice, once on a business trip and the second time with my wife to explore Shanghai. The view is amazing and the interior of the hotel rooms extraordinary and indeed special for a hotel chain where you usually expect an uniform style rather than arts &amp; crafts of the country. I would suggest to book a Club River view room. The River view is a must and the Club lounge offers excellent food &amp; wines in the evening. Enjoy it; there is no other choice in Shanghai than the Grand Hyatt!"
79,2234,"May 27 2007 	Hated it!	I did not enjoy my one night stay at the Hyatt in Shanghai. Definitely not value for money. The staff never smiled (except for those at Oasis - The Spa) and their service were inconsistent. Their rooms are very average. I've stayed at The Westin and JW Mariott in Shanghai, both faired far better. Don't expect flat screen TVs and pay TV. Both unavailable at Hyatt Shanghai. I agree the structure of the building is impressive, but unfortunately, that does little for me when you're inside the building.Food - We tried both the Grand Cafe and Kobachi (Japanese restaurant). The lunch buffet at the Grand Cafe was overpriced and food was very average. Dinner at Kobachi was a waste of time and money. Service was slow - and again, no smiles from the staff. Sashimi weren't the freshest, but you can see the kitchen with Japanese chefs trying hard to salvage what's left of the restaurant. Overall, Hyatt in Shanghai is a 3-star hotel. I recommend The Westin, JW Mariott or the new Mansion Hotel in Puxi. If you must stay at Pudong, try the Shangri-la."
80,2234,"May 11 2007 	Could be better	Stunning hotel from the architectural point of view, has a few disappointing features. Concierge services rates are crazy expensive for Chinese standards and the rooms aren't very impressive. On the other hand, very corteous staff, excellent gym and pool and a few restaurants: I've tried them all and the best one is the Italian."
81,2234,"Mar 31 2007 	Disappointing	I stayed here in November 2006 on a corporate rate, around RMB 1800. I worked in the Jin Mao office tower circa 2002 when the hotel upstairs was the new luxury standard in Shanghai, so had high expectations for this visit. Instead, I found it to be very disappointing for the price and hotel standard.Although my fiance and I had requested a king-size bed, at our early afternoon check-in we were informed that the hotel was full and we were given a twin bed room. No apologies, no attempt to make up for the mix-up. The room rate did not include breakfast, which I found shocking for a hotel of this standard. Every other luxury business hotel that I've stayed in within China has included breakfast. The room we received was surprisingly small and had an odd trapezoidal shape-- terrible feng shui. More surprising were the large stains all over the bit of carpet in our room. I can live with shoddy carpets at a budget hotel, but it's totally unacceptable for a five star hotel. The bathroom was also somewhat less than spotless,Concierge services appear to be astronomically priced for China. We tried to arrange a full-day driver, and were quoted around RMB 1800 for eight hours, which is more than many Shanghai drivers earn in a month. We checked with other friends in Shanghai who helped us to book another car service at only RMB 500 for eight hours (totally professional, Buick minivan with a wonderful driver).To be fair, the gym, pool and restaurants here are all lovely. It rained heavily during our stay, so we did not have a chance to enjoy the legendary views. But I would absolutely not stay here again on my own dime."
82,2234,"Feb 15 2007 	True Grand Hyatt Style	I found the Grand Hyatt to be a wonderful hotel, and after staying in hyatt's all over the world i belive it's one of the best.. service is fantastic staff everywhere, Max the concierge got us great tables and some of the best restaurants in the city..... one word of advice would be to TIP... I would guess that staff really dont get paid that much and if are to make it worth there while things happen very quickly... Tables at the best restaurants on short notice, bags taken to and from rooms very quickley.. ect ect"
83,2234,"Jan 14 2007 	A heavenly room amongst the clouds	A modern, beautiful hotel that rises above the clouds! Looking up and down in the atrium as itself a spectacular sight, not to mention the outside panoramic view! We had a deluxe Bund view room on one of the higher floor of the hotel and the views were simply breathtaking, especially at night when the entire city is lit up. The room was nice, with floor to ceiling glass windows all around. The sleek marble bathroom also offered wonderful views. Overall an impressive stay but obviously you will want to request the highest floor possible."
84,2234,"Jan 7 2007 	nice view	My family stays at the Grand Hyatt occasionally since we go to Shanghai every year. The lobby is on the 54th floor, so every single room has a spectacular view. The rooms are around 40 square meters, fairly large compared to a typical hotel room. The Cafe is really a buffet with international cuisine. However, one adult cost around 200CNY (25USD) and is increasing every year. The hotel room was around 4000CNY (500USD) per night, which is absolutely ridiculous. Like any place in Shanghai, parking was very difficult to find. The hotel parking lot was very expensive, so we had to park elsewhere. In fact, the traffic and road setup around the building was so confusing that we accidently missed a loop road and went across the river. Across the river, traffic was even more confusing, and we ended up driving an hour just to find the entrance to the hotel."
85,2234,"Dec 6 2006 	nice lift lady service always smilling	The view from the hyatt shanghai is spectacular... more so during the night. i just love the service, everywhere you go , there would be someone to smile at and say hello to. ( Hyatt staff ) It made me feel welcomed and special. Please look up when you sit at the coffee lounge... a small problem is nobody seems to speak english. An international hotel should ensure at least all the staff that meets customers should at least speak basic english. a minor inconvenience , though those eager beaver to please attitude was thoroughly admirable.The rooms are simply majestic, not as good as grand hyatt singapore but better than grand hyatt jakarta. Well the hyatt singapore has just been refurbished so ... I do not like the switches they use , it looks cheap without attention, the bed was grand and the chinese words on the head bed made me a little wary. Also they dont have LCD Flat tv like hyatt singapore.The gym and swimming pool is great, the locker system a little confusing but someone is always there eager to help which is a must for foreigners.Just across the street there is a golf driving range, a good way to unwind. Food is great in any restaurant though they do not have cili padi, or small chilli.. well you cant have everything , overall an 8/10."
86,2234,Nov 11 2006 	Great for a romantic night stay	My finace had to move to Shanghai from the USA for 8 months. I went to visit him for two months and we thought it would be fun to stay at the Hyatt for a night. I cant tell you how great our room was. We were on the 67 or 68th floor in a room over looking the river. Our room was on the corner and had floor to cieling windows 180 dergee view. The garden tub also had a window with a very nice view. The bathroom was just wonderul. We ate at The Grill in the hotel which was nice. The cloud 9 bars has great view as well.
87,2234,"Oct 11 2006	Room in the clouds	My girlfriend and I were able to get a couple of tickets to the F-1 race in Shanghai and we were able to book a suite at the Hyatt. The hotel is centrally located in the city and about 45mins from PVG airport. We arrived late afternoon and went through the customs rush hour at the airport. We were met at the airport by the hotel staff and quickly taken to a car. I would recommend booking the hotel car, as taxis are difficult to come by at the airport. Like its sister hotel, the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, we were met on the ground floor, and quickly taken to check in on the 54th floor. Despite the hotel being fully booked for the race, the hotel staff was efficient and proffessional. We finished the check in process in our room on the 83rd floor. The suite consisted of 2 connecting rooms, a bit small and choppy. The rooms were well appointed but the furniture and furnishings are a little dated and worn. The bed was very comfortable, and the bath a little crowded and despite the 2 separate sinks, was a little small for 2 people to share at the same time. The view however was spectacular. I awoke early one morning to the sounds of construction and I couldnt understand how I could hear this on the 83rd floor. I looked out our bedroom window and saw another building about 20 floors below us going up. We tried the Japanese restaurant which was very good, we also had desert up on the 87th floor with another amazing view of Shanghai. I arranged for a hotel car for an early flight back to HongKong, the hotel arranged for a &quot;picnic style&quot; breakfast to be served in the car, a very nice touch."
88,2234,"Sep 11 2006 	Stunning Architecture	Stayed at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai September 8th through the 12th.The property is architecturally stunning. The building was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (Sears Tower Fame), and is 88 stories tall. The first 53 floors are offices. The lobby of the hotel is on the 54th floor and the hotel extends to the 87th floor. The 88th floor is an observation deck.The Grand Hyatt has an open atrium that extends from the 55th floor to the top of the building. Contains the world's highest hotel rooms, and is the world's tallest building with a hotel inside. My room was on the 67th floor! If the view of Shanghai isnt good enough from your hotel room, the Cloud 9 Lounge on the 87th floor is incredible and provides views of the entire city. Also, there is a lounge at the base of the hotels atrium.The finishes are beautiful  lots of stone and polished metal. Looks great considering the building was competed in 1998. The propertys food and beverage are OK but nothing special  there are like 6 restaurants  two Chinese, a Japanese, and the rest are American. Honestly the food is overpriced (you can go to Wampoa Club, one of the nicest restaurants in the city, for less money). The two lounges I mentioned before are great.The fitness center is amazing as well  its on the 57th floor, and also offers great views of Shanghai from the pool area and Jacuzzi.As far as the service goes, nobody bends over backwards for you but everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. Nobody is smothering you with service, which probably comes from the fact that the hotel has 555 rooms. The concierges are more than happy to book a table at any restaurant in the city. They give good directions and also offer very good recommendations for things to do. English is a bit choppy across the board.The Grand Hyatt deserves to be at the top of the list in Shanghai for architecture alone. The rooms are also great and when I stayed the rate was only 1900 Yuan per night. Dont expect to be wowed by the service."
89,2234,"Aug 24 2006 	Bad bad service	I was very much looking forward to staying at the Grand Hyatt. It looked amazing and indeed it was very impressive - a hotel whose top floors on most days are above the clouds! As regards architecture and structure and views it did not let us down. However from the offset it is obvious good service is not something you get at this hotel. The check-in desk staff were unhelpful and their supervisor/manager was just rude. We had booked 2 rooms at the same rate - all agreed in advance with Hyatt reservations. When we arrived at the hotel they upped my friends' room rate with no explanation. I had to barter (Good Old Shanghai, eh?!) and got some moey down but it ended up being 50 more expensive a night than reservations had told us. Not one word of apology, he was just stroppy and rude. But we needed to sleep having flown overnight from London so we checked in anyway.Rooms very nice. Comfortable large beds, huge bathtub and separate shower. Lovely bathrooms. TV ok. Views were amazing (we were on 78th floor!) when the clouds weren't there (one of the four days!) but throughout the hotel service is poor. The only exceptions are the 'lift girls' who hold the lift for you, the Concierge and the gym/pool/spa staff, who should really teach the receptionists/bar staff etc good service as they were impeccable.I've seen the view now so I'm afraid to say I'm unlikely to stay there again. Especially as we booked a car to pick us up from the airport and were quoted 40 sterling and upon checkout they tried to charge me 80 sterling. I got than 40 back though. It's a shame the service is so poor as the hotel itself could be amazing - the building lends itself to that."
90,2234,"Jul 9 2006 	Great Views and Room but An Unpleasant Stay	On our fourth visit to Shanghai (one of our favorite cities) I decided to splurge and spend one night at the Grand Hyatt. We had eaten meals there and I thought it would be a fun to place to stay.The good part about the hotel is the amazing architecture and jaw dropping views. It is a phenomenal building. Everything is very modern and slick but it felt cold. Plus, there is not enough attention paid to the details in the upkeep of the hotel--scuff marks, stains and cooking odors in the hallways, etc.Right from the onset the staff acted very cold and stiff. They won't let you change money without showing your passport, even though they took a photo of it when you checked in twenty minutes earlier. You can't swim in the pool (which is quite small) without wearing a bathing cap. There are some very odd warnings in the back of the guest book (the hotel will prosecute you if you entertain prostitutes, pass out prohibited material in the hotel, etc--I have never seen anything like it in a Chinese hotel before) Although the food was very good, it is served with few smiles. All in all, we did not feel welcome at this Hyatt.The rooms are slick and showcases the view perfectly. The decor is dark but the view is really magnificent (despite the pollution which is a given in China). The bathroom is fancy which tons of dark marble and chrome but is cramped.Once you leave the hotel you are pretty much in the middle of nowhere. I asked the concierge about places to walk to and he said there wasn't much. After wallking past emply mud lots and construction sites we wound up at the river front. We had a fabulous walk there, looking at the bund and the ships on the water (rhere us also a great aquarium and a lovely Shangrila Hotel with a very friendly staff).After one night we did an early check out and hurried back to the Four Seasons where we had suite for a lot less money. Perhaps our view wasn't the greatest at the Four Seasons but we felt so much more welcome and the staff is much kinder."
91,2234,"Jul 3 2006 	Left with mixed feelings	I recently stayed for 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt Shanghai. I booked this hotel mainly because of it's design (the building and the rooms) and the fantastic view. I booked a Grand Deluxe River View Room and added access to the Grand Club Lounge. The room and the bathroom which were in the 64th floow were both quite spacious. The room features two floor-to-ceiling walls of glass which offer an amazing 180 degree view over Shanghai. In the evening hours the view is incredible.The room itself was well appointed and clean. The carpet looked a little bit worn. The bathroom was clean and there were plenty of towels and two robes and slippers were provided. The bathroom also has a large window by the bath tub with a great view over the river.Room service was good, turndown service was provided, privacy was kept when the do-not-disturb-sign was switched on (which is not the case in all hotels).However, while the room and bathroom are 5 star standard the service was not:Booked limousine transfer but no car was provided and I had to take a taxi.Booked non-smoking room which was confirmed at booking - still got a smoking room.Fresh fruit was delivered only on some days - seemed to be dependant on the mood of the maid. Same goes for the newspaper.Service personnel was quite distant with a few exceptions. You could easily sit in the Grand Club Lounge for 30 minutes with no waiter approaching you to take your order for a drink. Help yourself!Snacks and canapees in the Grand Club Lounge were ok during evening hours, although not exceptional.Breakfast was ok only. Have had much better breakfasts in other hotels.No dress code enforced at the Grand Club Lounge. Also, young kids are allowed in as well. It get's very noisy at times.Hotel lobby is very noisy as plenty of non-hotel-guests linger around for the great view.Missed genuine friendlyness throughout the hotel.As for dinner, I only tried the Jin Mao Club on the 87th floor. The service was good and the view is of course fantastic. However, the food was very bland and not nicely presented. The only decoration was two pieces of brocoli. Also, advertised as the 'most exclusive dining' in Shanghai you would expect the restaurant to enforce a decent dress code. Instead you see plenty of people in shorts and sandals and kids running around. Very disappointing.All things considered, still a good hotel. While I would give it a 5 star rating for the room and bathroom, I would give a max 4 star for the service. The restaurant even less...I recommed to go there for the view and the nice rooms. But don't expect outstanding service - you won't get it."
92,2234,"Jul 1 2006	Less Than Impressed	So I was in Beijing for business (stayed at the Peninsula which was amazing), and decided to come to Shanghai for the weekend for pleasure. Everyone I talked to state-side and in Beijing said to stay at the Grand Hyatt because it was the very best in Shanghai. It was also very expensive, but I decided to go with it because I wanted to treat myself. While the hotel itself (building, lobby, views, etc...) is extraordinary, I am very disappointed in my VERY expensive room. I have a king river view room which cost $280/night and is nowhere near as nice as the room I had just come from in Beijing which was $100 cheaper per night. The location, I am starting to find, is rather troublesome as well, it seems that the majority of &quot;excitement&quot; is on the other side of the river...which is not a far distance, but the traffic is so horrible that it always takes a MINIMUM of 30 minutes by taxi.All in all...it's an odd situation. Beijing, the town that is supposed to be so much less-sophisticated than Shanghai, I had for less money a MUCH nicer room that included free limo to and from the airport and breakfast. In Shanghai, where I am &quot;supposedly&quot; staying in the best place in town by everyone's accounts...the room is MUCH more expensive, not nearly as nice, car service is an additional $60 each way, and the breakfast is an additional $25. The most annoying part to me...the AC in the room is not that effective. I like a COLD room, especially when it is 95 degrees outside...and on the coldest setting the room is just ok.I'm too lazy to switch hotels at this point, but from what I've heard there are many hotels on the other side of the river that are nice and cheaper. I would recommend those."
93,2234,"Jun 4 2006	OK for business not for a weekend	I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for a conference recently and stayed on for the weekend. That was a mistake. The hotel is most notable for its views, but the air in Shanghai is so filthy that most days the views were quite limited. Given the prices, the room was small - at least too small for a couple with a baby. The choice of restaurants and cafes was also limited, with no basic coffee shop to pop into for a drink and a snack.Worst of all, there's nothing around the hotel, so we needed a taxi to go everywhere. But with no pool or outside space at all, we had no choice.On the upside, the food was good and the staff extremely helpful. I'd certainly recommend this hotel for a single businessman or woman, but not for a family and definitely not for a holiday."
94,2234,"May 27 2006	Heaven in the Clouds	I loved my three day stay here. I had a lovely king bedded room on the 77th floor facing the Bund and the Oriental Pearl. The room is beautiful. A bit overstated but all in all remarkable.Dining was good in the hotel. I had an excellent Australian steak in the Grill. The buffets offered in the Cafe were very good although no bargains. I was only frustrated by the RMB45 price of each and every glass of iced tea. Sorry but that is excessive. Drinks in the Bar on 54 were reasonable for deluxe hotel and the service was good. The Cloud 9 bar did not live up to expectations. The drinks were excessive and the room is quite small. I think the service was notched up a bit in the attitude department. All in all, lovely. Definitely an expensive stay but if you love really good hotels as a fun getaway -- then this should go on your list."
95,2234,"May 14 2006	Grand Hyatt is heaven on earth	The Grand Hyatt is heaven on earth and a world unto itself. From the time you enter its private entrance in the Jian Mao Building (the 4th tallest in the world), it is pure luxury.The hotel is located on the 53rd to the 88th floor and my room had an incredible view looking over at the Pearl TV Tower and down upon the surrounding skyscrapers.The room and especially the bath were very comfortable and luxurious.Not sure how much of a value the hotel is as was given a very special discount due to my company's affiliation with hotel.Many restaurants and lounges to choose from, but all are veryb pricey. Do not miss a cocktail in the Cloud 9 and The Patio. The Garden Court Restaurant (main floor) does mainly buffets, but a la carte is also offered. Dinner buffet was quite good, with lots of fresh seafood. The hotel has a beautiful spa and indoor pool. While in the building, you can take the elevator to the Observation Deck for a price. A bit of a carnival scene up there and of course very crowded.I did not care for the location of the hotel, but then I never left to venture out into Pudong.I much prefer staying across the river looking over at the amazing architecture of Pudong."
96,2234,"May 12 2006	Superb	Even if this wasnt the worlds highest hotel, it would still get five stars. Everything about this place oozes class, from the beautiful bedrooms, the spotless and brand new building to the attentive staff. Add in an exceptional pool and spa complex (highest in the world), the worlds highest bar, a number of good restaurants etc and you have a superb package. The location is less of an issue than expected - four metro stops from the Maglev terminal (take Exit 5 from the metro or you will NEVER get across the 8 lane highway!) and a 10 minute walk from the &quot;mere words cannot describe it&quot; Bund tourist tunnel. It is not cheap but you really cannot go wrong here unless for some reason you need to be on the Puxi side of the river."
97,2234,"May 11 2006	Do not stay here if you are a tourist	We had agonised long and hard about which hotel to choose for our first visit to Shanghai and finally plumped for the Grand Hyatt as it is clearly the hotel of the moment. When we arrived we asked whether we could change our booking, which had been for a Bund Twin Room (all they had available at the time) to a King Room but were told they were completely full. However they could offer us a Bund Queen Room on the 71st floor. Now they claim on their website that the average size of these standard rooms is 40 sq m, but in our room at least 15 sq m were accounted for by the hallway. The bedroom was tiny, barely room to walk around the bed which itself was suspiciously small for a queen size. The bathroom also was an odd shape, with just one sink and the cheapest selection of toiletries I have ever seen in a 5 star hotel (local, non-branded, nasty). The biggest disappointment, however, was the view. Again on the website they show pictures of wonderful ceiling-to-floor glass windows overlooking the Bund. Due to the design of the building, however, beyond a certain floor level the windows are in fact heavily cross-framed with thick iron girders meaning the view is far from visible unless you stand right next to the pane. We called reception to complain about the size of the room and were told that many rooms in the hotel had such odd (and inefficient) shapes due to the &quot;unique design of the building&quot;. However they would call us in the morning if a better room became available. As we had arrived late and were tired we decided to try the Italian restaurant in the hotel. When we walked in it was like walking into a canteen - small tables (with no tableclothes) lined up along the window, almost every one occupied by (largely) American businessmen in suits and their Chinese hosts. The service was so fast that we were out in less than an hour and the quality of the food was distinctly average given the high prices - approximately 70 pounds a head including for two courses and an indifferent bottle of wine.We had booked to stay for 5 nights but by this stage had decided that this really wasn't the hotel for us. Aside from the disappointment with the room, it seems that this hotel is entirely geared to the business traveller. As we would learn over the next few days it's location for a tourist is truly terrible - on the wrong side of the river in a town where taxis can be like gold-dust late at night; surrounded by two large building sites; and a ten minute one-way system to enter the traffic tunnel to where you really want to be which is itself heavily congested night and day.The next morning we were not surprised when reception didn't contact us to offer a new room. When we checked out we were not asked why we were leaving four days early - only the doorman seemed surprised when we told him we wanted a taxi to the Four Seasons. I am sure if we had stayed put at the Hyatt we would have had a very much inferior experience of Shanghai. We loved the Four Seasons - its location, atmosphere and staff - and would urge anyone who doesn't absolutely have to stay in Pudong to stay on the other side of the river."
98,2234,"Apr 1 2006 	A perfect city hotel	This is a first-rate 5-star hotel in every way. It's beautiful, sleek, well-staffed and it has the most magnificient views. It also has several great restaurants, bars and a nightclub all in the same building. I especially liked the piano lounge with live music. The beds are extremely comfortable, linens are top quality, and the power showers are awesome. Splurge and pay for a room on the executive floors. Its lounge offers an amazing breakfast and cocktail spread. Given all this, this hotel is a bargain. I could go on and on about how fabulous this hotel is. I've stayed here 4 times and each time, it was a fantastic experience."
99,2234,"Mar 5 2006 	Good hotel but at an expensive price	I am in Shanghai over 30 times a year and try the Grand Hyatt every now and then out of curiosity. Service has improved noticeably since a year ago. The view on a good day is impressive and I would certainly recommend all first timers to Shanghai stay here. Breakfast and room service are both of excellent quality. Downsides - getting very expensive now at around US$250 or so per night in peak season (like now). This is in a country where GDP per capita is only US$1,000 p.a.! But it's very crowded with loads of tourists and business people. The atrium style internal design means that public areas can get noisy. And because of the crowds room preference is sometimes unavailable unless you have super frequent stayer status. Rooms can also be strange as the design means there are many shapes. Astonishingly enough there are no HBO or Cinemax programmes in the rooms. All in all, still a good hotel but value for money is average only. I prefer the St Regis as it is quieter, less expensive and has bigger rooms."
100,2234,Feb 15 2006	Loved the Grand Hyatt	Stayed the week of February 5th. The view was incredible. Staff was very attentive. Rooms were very clean. Whenever we called the front desk for more bottled water or towels they were at our door within minutes. The lounge on the 56th floor is a nice relaxing place to unwind after a day of touring.I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt.
101,2234,"Feb 9 2006	Grand Hyatt...Grand Experience!	My stay at the Hyatt was simply perfection! The rooms have floor to ceiling windows with views that will blow off your socks! They have extremley comfortable beds and cool bathrooms with a tub overlooking the city! The restaurants there all all top notch but Canton by far sticks out from the rest....true authentic cantonese food...the peking duck is out of this world! Cloud 9 is a great place to end the night with a nice drink and dessert. PU-J's was a great place for entertainment..in the back they even have a nice dance club..when i went it was empty but they played great music...it was so much fun even though it was just my husband and i dancing. The breakfast buffet is great...they have some really fresh fruit. The gym is small but very clean with spectacular views as well. If you like to swim they have a huge indoor pool...the spa is ok. Overall, wonderful experience...it's definately worth the money!"
102,2234,"Feb 2 2006	5 star view only	We stayed at the Grand Hyatt for the Chinese New Year to enjoy the view to the BUND and the fireworks in Shanghai. Undoubtedly, the view from the rooms is really great and we could really enjoy the celebration taking place in the city.However, altogether, the hotel did not live up to our expectations. This does not mean it is a bad hotel but considering the value for money and the smile you should have on your face leaving it (after a leisure stay)...it does not get it right.The room:We had a grand suite. This is basically a bedroom with a little big bigger study attached. It really shouldn't be called suite and the design is quite odd since a lot of space is wated for the doorway. On the positive side, the room is still very new and the bathroom is georgeous. Really great with BUND view from the bathtub and TV :)The room service on the other hand is not on par. They do the standard things right, however, they didn't vacuum, even though there were obvious traces of bread on the floor. The day before, the room was set for three guests, after cleaning, everything was just available for 2. Basic things were missing...Club Floor:The breakfast and the &quot;happy hour&quot; at the club floor were better then average. The breakfast is limited in its choice but ok. The service is ok. Friendly but nothing more. The manager still needs a little practice, since I told him a couple of my complaints but no reaction at all. He even bothered us with some odds things that were no of our concern.Service overall:Only ok. Downstairs during the day, the service is ok, however, mainly busy with tourists visiting the lobby or one of the restaurants. When it becomes evening and mainly hotel guests come through the entrance, it seems that the service people are really tired and don't care too much anymore. At the check out, the only purpose was to collect our money. In no way they tried to ask us if we enjoyed the stay or anything else.Summary: Go for the view if you are willing to spend the money, but stay in your room and don't set your expectations too high. I think as a business traveller they will be able to treat you right, since you will be busy most of the day and just return to the room during the evening...but then there are either cheaper or better choices. As a leisure traveller, most likely you will be disappointed (as we were).P.S.: When we went, we saw the mixed reviews however, the hotel was still ranked #1 in the traveladvisor list...next time I checked it was #11 :( It fits the hotel better! but if this would have displayed earlier, it would have definetely influenced our choice."
103,2234,"Jan 30 2006 	Great Hotel	I work in the travel industry and am fortunate to have stayed in some brilliant hotels. The Grand Hyatt along with its namesake in Hong Kong are the best hotels I have ever stayed in. This one is impressive in scale and appearance; all the staff I met were friendly and helpful; and the 2 restaurants I tried were both excellent. The hotel location is a bit awkward being surrounded by busy roads and on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the river. However, taxis are cheap. Shanghai itself seemd a bit sterile, lacking the vibrant atomsphere of Hong Kong, and visually its an impressive skyline but best at night.Would I stay here again? yes as long as someone else paid. Shanghai, makes an interesting 2-3 day stopover, but not a holiday destination."
104,2234,"Jan 18 2006 	Impressive but expensive and sterile - Hong Kong is better.	I stayed in The Hyatt as it was ranked as No1 in Trip advisor for Shanghai. Had to go to Shanghai for work from 12th to 16th January 2006.The hotel is my opinion is over rated. I have stayed in serval Chinese cities on business and most hotels are of a mediocre standard. This hotel has the potential to be the best in class. I has an incredible presence with 89 foors. The first 53 floors are offices (from a differnt entrance.) Floor 54 is reception. The health club and pool (very nice indeed) are on 57th floor and the posh restaurant is right on the top on the 89th !! We are talking Empire State building proportions here. There is another hotel going up next door - due for completion in 2007 with over 100 levels so both hotels will become a world landmark. (the locals are slightly concerned about this in view of 9/11) So it's impressive, the rooms are good, the views are of Shanghai are OK . Shanghai is not the prettiest city in the world. Accomodation for 15 million people has been planned and built within the last 20 years so it really is 200sq miles of wall to wall concrete. So why didn't I like the hotel ? Firstly it is very expensive. Beware - local taxes and service charges add 25% to the prices quoted here. This is one of the most expensive hotels in China and although the staff are polite (rather than genuinely interested) - there is no 'ambiance'. The whole place feels sterile. You can eat in silence in the restaurant and pay 30 for your meal - or go straight across the road to the Chinese restaurant (with yellow seats) The Golden -'something' - and eat fresh fish, meats and steamed vegetables including beer for under 5. It was delightful. Shanghai was also a bit disappointing. It tries to be the new Hong Kong - but for me HK will always outshine with intersting and bold high rise architecture, endless selections of hotels, shops and restaurants to suit all budgets. HK has great night life and feels really safe. Not sure i felt quite as safe in Shanghai."
105,2234,"Jan 11 2006	So overrated it's not funny... don't waste your money!	My husband and I travel over the holidays each year and decided this year to make it Shanghai.Since we figured we probably wouldn't make it back to Shanghai in the near future, and we were going to be there for about 10 days, we decided to stay at a few hotels, and that the Grand Hyatt in the fourth highest building in the world should definitely be one of them.Since we would be staying there on 31-Dec and 1 &amp; 2 Jan, we thought we would spring for a Bund View Suite to make it really special, which was about $350US or $500 Australian.We took a taxi from the Portman Ritz Carlton, the hotel we were staying in prior to this, and found straightaway that the area around Pudong looked boring and depressing, with a few tourist stops and nothing much else.When we got to the check-in desk on the 54th floor, it was jam-packed, so we were happy to learn that, since we booked a rate with club access, we could check-in on the club floor, floor 83.We were greeted by a very snooty club check-in person and shown to our suite on the 82nd floor. I must admit, the suite was huge, and the view was very grand.The check-in person, of course, played that up as much as possible, and then followed us around the place for a full 10 minutes or so waiting for a tip, even though we had already thanked him and made it clear that wasn't going to happen.Normally, we are good tippers, however in this instance, this was not the person who brought our luggage. All he had done was check us in. In addition, in Shanghai, there is a 15% service charge which is intended to cover such service, so that a tip on top of that would be ridiculous. Indeed, nobody at the other hotels we had stayed at (Westin &amp; Ritz Carlton) had expected nor waited around for a tip.For heaven's sake, we were already paying $500/nt... it was downright rude of this person to hassle us for a tip!Just to top it off, we realized a bit later that the bed was only a queen size bed, and we had paid for a King bed suite. At this point we were too angry to even bother complaining.The club was reasonably well-stocked, but was very very packed. So much so that we had to ask if we could move a chair to create a table we could sit at. A staff member who looked very put out by us reluctantly moved the chair so we could sit.There were also many children in the club, some of which were running around screaming and sticking their filthy hands in the buffet.Again, for the price we were paying, I would have expected a little peace in the lounge and certainly not having children sticking their hands in the buffet.And I would have expected the staff to be both better trained to serve their guests, rather than looking put out by it.Several times in different areas of the hotel, I was asked by staff &quot;may I help you?&quot;, which made me feel as if they were questioning my right to be in a particular area.When I visited the pool, I was the only one using it, and a staff member was assigned to sit along the side and watch me... I couldn't figure out why? To make sure I wouldn't steal anything? That's the way it felt.While the view was gorgeous, and the hotel very elegant, we were made to feel most unwelcome the whole time we were there. So much so that we checked out two days early, only staying for one night, and moved to the puxhi side of the river near Peoples square, which is much more centrally located.My advice to anyone thinking of staying here is to save your money. Take a day trip to Pudong (that's all you'll need, it's pretty boring) and have a drink up at the bar at the Grand Hyatt, and choose a hotel such as the Westin which is less expensive, more friendly and more centrally located."

107,2234,"Jan 4 2006 	Shanghai landmark worth staying	This is an absolute must see destination in Shanghai - even if you are not staying in this hotel. Even the high price of rooms Grand Hyatt should not put you off when considering hotels in Shanghai. For a day or two at least. I stayed at the Executive Floor (Grand Club) - on the topmost floors with its own check in facilities. I do not think that the views or services differ very much if you decide to stay a couple floors down in a standard room. The room was absolutely great and the views even better. My room was so high up that clowds prevented the view over to the city most of the time. However even walking next to the floor-to-ceiling windows makes those ones of us who are afraid of high places shiver. Centre of Shanghai and especially Pudong side of the city resembles Gotham City (from Batman, the movie) and the Jin Mao Tower where this hotel is located is a star reminder of that. The small details in rooms are great: heated mirrors that do not fog when you take a shower, lights that switch automatically on when you walk to the room etc etc. They have really paid attention even to the smallest of details at this hotel. Location: As Grand Hyatt is located at Pudong side of the city it is in a somewhat awkward location. Jin Mao Tower is surrounded on all sides by broad motorways and crossing these is next to impossible by foot. There is an underground station some 500 metres from the hotel but getting there is a problem as crossing the streets take ages - and is dangerous. So you should rely on taxis and take into account that getting to the otherside of the Pearl River may take even 1-2 hours at peak times. Despite of the seemingly short distance.I prefer outdoor pools which this hotel does not provide. However the indoor pool at Grand Hyatt and the excerise rooms were absolutely superb.Remember that even as a guest at this hotel you are constantly overlooked. Elevators, corridors and all other public areas are constantly monitored and if you actions apper suspicious to the overlookers you will immediately get a voice responce. I once tried to get to the opmost floor restaurant which was not open at that time and immediately after pressing the elevator button I got a voice responce from the &quot;overlookers&quot;: &quot;Sir.. may I help you... the restaurant is open only in the evening...&quot; You'll see cameras all over the cenre of Shanghai taking a good look of your actions. Shopingwise, there is no better place than Shanghai. So leave a lot of room in you luggage for all the things you end up buying!"
108,2234,"Dec 3 2005	A must visit destination	Location: Its at a convenient point at Pudong: a short stroll to the Superbrand Mall and the Oriental Pearl TV tower. The St Regis is way up further but the Shangri-La is closer to the river (for postcard view of the Bund). If location is paramount, the Portman Ritz is next to Plaza 66 for luxury shopping and JW Marriott is in the centre of Nan Jing Road (between Ritz and Westin).Dcor/Design: If you are overwhelmed by the Peninsula Hong Kong or most Ritz Carltons and rate highly on their dcor, then the Grand Hyatt would slightly disappoint you. As a modern architect, I would prefer a modern design with a respect to the history/local culture, so you feel the essence of a particular country but still on the right track of time. Grand Hyatt embodies this concept. It is not as minimalist as Park Hyatt Tokyo, but not as culturally-infused as the old Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong (now being refurb). Hyatt incorporates the golden day of Shanghais art deco style with modern Chinese; and the result is excellent. Even the building (Jin Mao Tower) by top US firm SOM is truly breathtaking, one of my all time favorite buildings!. It even impresses my old-fashioned mother!Lobby/Public space: Although large (500 plus rooms), Grand Hyatt is surprisingly small inside, it almost feel boutique. You have to change 2 lift banks from ground to lobby; and to your room. In between is the lobby with double story lounge area and breathtaking bund view, which can be overcrowded in the afternoon with tourists taking photos or tour groups flocking the lobby.The much publicized 30 storey atrium is smaller in reality, but still awe-inspiring. There is a lobby lounge on its base with no view so unless you have a good conversation, staring at the atrium could be boring and dizzying after a while.Rooms: Opt for the Grand Bund View room for an extra! The view is truly impressive with views directly to the Oriental TV tower, aerial view of Bund and Shanghais skyline. Be careful when choosing room, as the buildings design is tapering to the top, so some rooms can be smaller than the other; rooms on the corner side are larger (still standard room) than in the middle. Standard room is 40m2, but my gold passport room at Level 71 is much much larger as it sits on the corner. What you see in the brochure is exactly what you get. The bed headboard is adorned with Ming dynasty poet, which is quite special. The window is from floor to ceiling with a lot of horizontal frames in between which might obstruct looking at the view. There is no sofa, but a relaxing chair with ottoman. In the brochure it was said there are wireless keyboard to connect to TV, but in reality this service has been cancelled, I guess some of the mainland clients must have took it home. Bathroom supposes to be big, but the layout makes them feel smaller. I particularly dislike the flimsy glass door for the WC, I mean how does it work with the acoustic (remember hot shanghai food)??. But the amenities are nicely packed as a souvenir. Noise: My room shares a wall with the lift shaft, but we could hardly hear anything!. In fact the only noise we encountered is a constant yelling from a mainland customer next door, which is very annoying!. I hope its not how they talk because I swear it feels like a battle ground.Food: Didnt try the buffet there, but the Cloud nine has fantastic view. The food court (by Hyatt) on the basement should be avoided.Facilities: Swimming pool has views over Shanghai, which is fantastic.Service: Polite, efficient and personal. You were whisked directly to your room by one of the receptionist where he introduces the room. But on one visit to the business centre, one of the lady there did not understand what is a brochure / catalogue that I simply gave up.Overall, a must see destination. The layout and sky location is similar to the JW Marriott but for me Hyatt reigns supreme. If budget is not an issue, opt for Grand Deluxe Bund view with 180 degree view of Shanghai."
109,2234,"Nov 15 2005	Spectacular Grande Hyatt	One of the most beautiful hotels we've ever stayed in, with service to match.Because of the height (hotel occupies from floor 54 through 85) the views from our room, public rooms, all restaurants and bar, are simply breathtaking. Food at breakfast, and at two of three restaurants, the best we had in the city. Spa was also terrific--I had two Oriental massages, a facial and a manicure. Decor (art deco) stylish but inviting. Unlike many of the other 5 star hotels (which we visited--Ritz, JC Mandarin, Shangri-La, with cavernous lobbies), the Hyatt feels more personal and warmer. Concierge desk competent and charming. The location is not the negative as billed. Shanghai is enormous, and spread out--and not really a walking city like many in Europe. So to go anywhere, you must take a taxi, which is very cheap. It is worth an extra few minutes in a taxi to stay at this first class hotel."
110,2234,"Nov 10 2005	Make sure you know what you are getting into!	The experience started of poorly. I personally wrote to the Hotel in Shanghai as suggested by reservations, inquiring about a long-term stay. A 21day stay to be exact. They quoted me a more expensive rate than the most expensive I could find on Hyatt.Almost crooked!Eventually, we change travel plans to stay only 6 nights. We only ended up staying 3 nights! Food in the Italian restaurant was fair. The service was about 2 star level. It is really a business hotel where the are very proficient at moving them &quot;In and out&quot;. They really have not interest in the qaulity of stay. The Business traveler does not have much time to spend complaining about accomadations that their Company is booking and paying. Service was poor from the Front Desk to the Atrium Bar, where we sat for 10 minutes and never were greeted/served. It might be worth a stay for 2 nightsin a &quot;Grand Deluxe Bund View Room&quot;. Free breakfast in Atrium Bar with a free Gold Passport. Sky pool and gym are to be seen. Just understand you will be run over by business people and expect 2 star service. If you can get past that you will enjoy 2 nights.5 star service with better location can be found at the JW Marriot."
111,2234,"Oct 30 2005 	Spectalular experience	Spectacular experience, what else can be said about this hotel in this great city. Ashtonishing views and architecture make this hotel a once in a lifetime experience. If you are going to Shanghai once in your life, this is the place to stay. The overall service and western food at the Cafe were very good.The only drawback is that it is located in Pudong, the new Shanghai, while most of your activities are in the other side of the river / city and a taxi is needed everytime going out. Anyhow it isn't too far or expensive and its worth it.Also definitely, try to get a room with a view to the Bund and a river view. That is a must."
112,2234,"Oct 15 2005	Deluxe bath with a view	Many reviewers mentioned the deluxe bathroom and I must just add a few words on this. Make sure you get a deluxe room with Bund view, order a botle of champagne and strawberries and enjoy the magnificent view from the bathtub."
113,2234,"Sep 30 2005 	Unrivalled Views at Hyatt Shanghai	Without a doubt this hotel is one of the most memorable I have stayed in recently. Standard rooms are a cut above the rest and the service was impeccible. Not only do the rooms command some of the best views of Shanghai, they are extremely spacious and tastefully decorated as well as good value for money. A wall of windows in the bathroom meant every time I lay back in the bath I had a spectacular view of the city shimmering below.The spa was excellent with a wide variety of treatments and the pool, on floor 57, is the highest in the world. This by no means is an average hotel and I do hope to stay here again.There are numerous restaurants in the hotel ranging from Japanese sushi, traditional Shangainese and even Italian. It's what I would expect of a Hyatt and am surprised to read some disappoiting reviews.I can't really think of any down points other than you can't buy cigars in the Grand Cafe at 3am in the morning after partying the night away in the Bund! As a 29-year-old female non smoker, I didn't really want one that much anyway!"
114,2234,"Sep 26 2005	Take away the view and it's distinctly average	Before starting this review it's worth putting my post in perspective as Iappreciate it's at odds with some of the other comments on the site.First of all I'm someone who spends every spare penny (and then some) on travel, and have had the privilege of staying in some really excellent hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpur and the Chedi in Muscat.In fact staying at the Hyatt Shanghai made me realise just how good they were!Though I'm far from the red faced western tourist who will bellow at the &quot;natives&quot; for not serving his beer cold enough, that does mean my expectations are set fairly highly.Secondly, I was here almost a week and so was perhaps able to road test the hotel more than had I breezed in and out on a corporate expense account.However, once you take away the views from the Hyatt, which the Shanghai guide books rightly rave about, my experience was that this is not a signature five star hotel at the top of its field. Instead, I found it distinctly average.Nothing too major to spoil our break, but some significant chinks nonetheless. To take the good and not so good from various areas of the hotel:* The public areas of the hotel and the rooms are decked out in dull, business colours, which is appropriate as the Hyatt is stuffed full of suits. And the place does seem to be well kitted out for a variety of business meetings, so if you are here on company business and just staying for a night or two it will probably be fine. But, other five star hotels have much more grand and (in the case of the Westin) stylish entrances and areas.* The staff: Lots of them milling about with dark suits and ear pieces. However, here is a case of where more really does not mean more. There were plenty of people around to whisk my plate away at dinner before my wife had finished eating, but on one or two occasions there was a distinct lack of initiative shown for some of the most simple requests.* The grand club: The Hyatt, like a lot of other 5 star hotels, makes a big deal about its club floors. The staff in the club lounge were generally the most helpful in the hotel, but the breakfast served upstairs is unfortunately a pale imitation of what you get (and, true, have to pay for) downstairs in the main restaurants. Also I was surprised that the piece of paper you are given when checking in fails to communicate one of the most useful perks of staying on a club floor - free Internet access in the business centre (usually around USD3 for 15 minutes).Don't think that staying on a higher floor will give you a better view though. On floor 80 upwards you are almost too high. The views are better from reception on floor 54.* The health club: The Hyatt has a small, but fairly well equiped gym. It also has separate men's and women's jacuzzi and sauna areas and a pool. When using the pool,they make you wear a swimming cap. If that's the rule then that's fine...but I expect everyone else to do the same.Bizzarely though on my second day I took a swim and spotted a Chinese man and his two kids in the pool. The kids wore a cap, the man didn't. As a result, I figured I didn't have to either.As I mentioned, the Hyatt has plenty of people lurking about doing nothing in particular, and the pool is no exception. I was promptly asked to put my cap on. When I pointed to the man, I was told my hair was longer. Not true, my hair is generally considered pretty short!On two other occasions, Chinese men didn't bother to wear the cap and weren't questioned. Only one of them had what could be considered to be a 'buzz cut.' The impression I was left with, was that these guys were some kind of big wigs and that asking them to don swimming gear would be a major loss of face by the local staff.* The spa: I had a stone massage at the 'Oasis Spa' near the gym and my wife had Chinese foot massage. Other five star hotels in Shanghai such as the Westin and Marriott have brand name spas attached (in the case of the Westin, a Banyan Tree).The impression I got from the Hyatt is that this was added as an after thought and the practitioners were more like enthusiastic amateurs, not therapists. The guy giving me the stone massage seemed like a masseur (he didn't speak English so I couldn't ask) and tried to be pleasant, but the way he was fumbling around with the rocks didn't inspire confidence. The spa room was also right by reception with the door open, so I could clearly hear people clearing the phlegm from their throats (quite a common sound in China)!* The location: Not great. All the action happens on the other side of the river. There is a road tunnel, but if this is closed or heavily congested your 10 minute trip can become a 45 minute one. I did overhear some guys saying they were building a new bar and entertainment area nearby though.* The view: Yes, the view is great and the building is an architectural landmark. The thing is, there is nothing stopping you coming to have a coffee in the Hyatt. Actually I'd recommend it. But Shanghai really is Sci-Fi city. Anywhere high up seems to have a view.In summary then, if you at the Hyatt for a short trip or have a business meeting nearby, then the hotel is probably the place for you. If you are here for a holiday, I recommend the Westin where we tried out the Banyan Tree Spa. I didn't see the rooms, but it looks a lot nicer inside and less staff milling about managed to be a lot more friendly and helpful!"
115,2234,"Sep 2 2005	The sky is the limit	Of course, before posting my review I've read the previous comments. Well, it's really hard to me believe that some people can report a bad experience with this Hotel. I have traveled all my life long, and I've stayed at the best Hotels in the world and, trust me, It's quite impossible to find something like the Shanghai's Grand Hyatt (and I'm not particulary in love with the Hyatt). I had a Diplomatic Suite in one of the Club floors and the room was incredible, at the 79th floor, with glass walls and a view on the city like the one you can have only from an airplane. The room, like the whole hotel, is very, very elegant and confortable. The service is accurate and kind. The restaurants are a bit smokey and busy, but the food is very good. The lobby is some 40-floor high and really impressive. In one word it's a once-in-a-life experience you can't miss! The only spot is about some employees speaking very poor english.P.S.: I have found two taxi lines and the one reserved to the hotel guests had the priority."
116,2234,"Aug 31 2005	Wonderful Experience	I read some bad and good reviews of this hotel before we went to Shanghai, but we choose to stay at the Hyatt anyways. It was a lovely experience. We stayed on the 81st floor, Bund view, club room, and that made the experience both wonderful and expensive at the same time. Everyone was very kind, and the club breakfast and happy hour was great. The pool and fitness area had the same lovely views, and the restaurant, Canton, had fabulous dimsum. I would stay at this hotel again.One thing though, the Internet isn't free in the room (and they charge you for each laptop about USD$15 a day), but if you have a notebook, use the club room for free.Also, try the mooncakes! They make a great present to bring someone. They are to die for!"
117,2234,"Aug 26 2005	Flying high in Shanghai	We stayed for 5 nights at the Grand Hyatt in August 2005. The hotel is situated between floors 54 and 88 in the 'Oriental Empire State Building', the Jin Mao Tower. There is no doubt that the building is impressive, even if the area, Pudong, is rather soulless - rather like a rather rubbish 1960's sci-fi film's 'city of the future'.Our room was a Grand King and consisted of bedroom with king bed, tv in cabinet and a desk, and a lovely bathroom with large bath, walk in shower with body jets, modern sink with heated mirror and a separate toilet. The storage area was rather limited with just the one wardrobe and very few drawers. The main attraction of the room is the floor to ceiling window which, from the 80th floor, gave superb views over the Bund (you need to request this or you will be given a Pudong city view which is not as exciting). We spent many an evening wowing at the amazing vision of Shanghai at night lit up with as much neon as possible (and amusingly the room has a sign which says 'Help Shanghai to save electricity'). The room was very clean but the accessories are a bad choice, e.g. a lot of stainless steel in the bathroom suffering from water marks as soon as you used it. The tv had a good number of channels but the air conditioning was not good, we were very warm at night (and I am never warm!)The staff in the hotel were courteous but a little stuffy at times. We had a problem with our credit card (security check even though we had phoned them to tell them we were in China, tut) and felt that it was far more of a hassle to them than it was to us.The club provides a good buffet breakfast (continental only), an afternoon tea and an excellent evening buffet. Hot and cold drinks are available throughout the day and we found this invaluable. The hotel contains a fine range of restaurants and bars and it is not necessary to leave the hotel. Be aware that it is necessary to book. Room service is delicious and we made good use of this. Always remember that a 15% service charge is applied, even if the service is lacking, and they will still leave a space for a tip!My main disappointment with the hotel was also my main delight. We loved the view from the room because of its situation however, as a tourist, it really is not the best place to be if you have come to visit Shanghai. Taxis are easy to get but the traffic is very busy; the Bund tourist tunnel is a lot of fun once, but an expensive option; and we never did manage to find the ferry port..."
118,2234,"Aug 21 2005	Breathtaking Hotel	The Grand Hyatt Shanghai is in the breathtaking Jin Mao Tower just wonderful located. I think it is one of the greatest hotel experiences in the world. Rooms in the corner of the building, where there are three glazed walls (even in the bathrooms!), are excellent. The food in the two Chinese restaurants and in the Japanese restaurant is outstanding. On level 87 is a charming bar and on level 53 there is the smart Piano Bar with live entertainment, perfect!BUT service was absolutely dreadful! On the first day they wanted to cancel our Club privileges, then there was some noises in our neighborroom and they didn't manage to stop it (not til we asked them to do so four times!). Another day we wanted to have a nice diner in the Canton restaurant. So we asked them in the afternoon for a specific table in front of the window, where you can overview the city by night. After two confirmations from the concierge (with adumbration), we came at eight o'clock to the restaurant and they gave us a table, which was not by the window, and the restaurant was full!!! And the staff and even the duty manager do not accommodate to you with a little regard. Rooms where not very clean too!The reason why I rate this hotel with four points is, that there isn't a better hotel in the city! We had a look to all of them (Four Seasons, St Regis, Marriot, Ritz Carlton), but they aren't as nice as the Hyatt.In spite of everything it is a beautiful place to stay!"
119,2234,"Aug 16 2005	Great hotel in a great city	We just returned from a 10 day trip to China. We were in 4 different hotels, but the Grand Hyatt definetly was the highlight of our trip. Our 70th floor room had an amazing view of the BUnd and the Oriental Pearl Tower, which was enormous in the evening. The room was very comfortable and good equipped. THe food was very good,both in the cafe, as well as the other restaurants. The room service was excellent. The bar &quot;Cloud 9&quot; on one of the highest floors had an extremely cosy atmosphere. We would stay here again. It was the nearest thing to heaven. Excellent!"
120,2234,"Aug 12 2005	All Hype -- Disappointed and Not Going Back	We were in Shanghai last Sept/Oct during their National Day holiday period. We were on a &quot;hotel-review mission&quot; because we stayed at both Westin and Grand Hyatt, both using points for their respective hotel &quot;frequent traveller&quot; program. What a difference service-wise, granted that we were also upgraded at Westin (to a residence apartment), and we were offered to pay another $100 for a river-view room at Hyatt. Both hotels had two taxi lines set up at the front door. One for hotel guests, and one for non-hotel guests. At Westin, when taxi was not in abundance, hotel guests always had the priority. At Hyatt,we waited in the taxi line where the sign for hotel guests was for 10 minutes, and they ignored us and only tending to people in the non-guest line. We did not get a taxi until I walked back into the lobby and complained.At Hyatt, the bedding consisted no flat sheet, no blanket, but only a comforter with bedcover or duvet cover (to make it sound better).At Westin, heavenly-bed a hype or not, there was the usual set up: flat sheet, covered blanket, then comforter with a duvet cover.At Hyatt, it took them almost an hour to get the crib set up in the room, after I requested at the front desk, called the front desk, called the housekeeping dept, spelling the word &quot;crib&quot; along the process. There is no comparison for the crib itself. It is indeed a heavenly-bed type crib at Westin, and I dreaded mold for the foam used at Hyatt, so my three-year-old ended up sleeping in our bed anyway."
121,2234,"Aug 1 2005 	An Incredibly Poor Excuse for a 5 Star Hotel	The Grand Hyatt is without doubt one of the worst alleged five star hotels I have ever stayed in. I was stuck there for five days last week due to a customer staying there and it was one bad experience after another. This from a hotel where I was paying in excess of US$300/night. From a surly arrival &quot;welcome&quot; in the Grand Club, to incredibly poor service in the Canton restaurant at a table with very important guests, to the removal of personal items from my room without permission, to the final straw - a general refusal to give credit for a dinner that made me sick, the hotel gives poor service. With the notable exception of the resident manager, Paul Kwok, every management person I interacted with first wanted to contradict everything I said, then wanted to &quot;investigate&quot; a problem and then wanted to prove me wrong and avoid responsibility. To quote from an email from the general manager -&quot;We have ascertained all the details pertaining to the incidents that you had mentioned earlier, with eye witness report and factual material that are in our favour. &quot; Basically, the customer is wrong and we are right. This attitude is pervasive in all of their dealings with customers. I would never stay in this hotel again and would caution others not to do so. Shanghai is full of great hotels - JW Marriott, Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons, there is no reason to stay in this poor excuse for a hotel."
122,2234,"Jul 27 2005	Good Hotel in a Great CIty	Having recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt Beijing, which was out of this world, I was very excited about my upcoming trip to the Grand Hyatt in the Jin Mao Tower. However, on arrival I felt that the hotel did not live up to its 5-star rating. For example, I had been looking forward to the pool facility, and was disappointed in that it was much smaller than I had envisioned. Also, I found the lobby lacking in both atmosphere and decor. The best part about our room was the bathroom, which had a large marble jacuzzi tub and a great shower. Otherwise, the room was nondescript. I would not stay there again."
123,2234,"Jul 15 2005	Profitable Stay!	Visited Shanghai for a few days and to top off our holiday, we checked into the Hyatt on 16th June. Got a bund view room on the 76th Floor ...... magnificent view at night of the bund. Ah! it's treats like this every once in a while that makes it memorable. Fantastic stay on our part and a profitable one for me personally ~ I trade options in my spare time and was trading the few nights we were in Shanghai, on the very night of our stay in the Hyatt I made a trade which gave me a $40K profit. My best ever 1 day trade ..... and for that, Grand Hyatt Shanghai will always be in my lucky hotel list!"
124,2234,May 25 2005 	Well......i was expecting more	was on the 75th floor - so of course it was a great view. but the rooms were hard to figure out - and seemed a bit musty/moldy. one of the robes hanging was dirty. That made me furious. It's just digusting to think about. the 54th floor is great. fantastic view. not sure i'd stay there again tho.

1,2236, do be warned of a certain young chap who is in charge of the eggs section. Very unfriendly to non-caucasians with a nonchalant attitude. Not a great way to start your mornings.	
2,2236, two bathrooms

4,2236, a living room
5,2236, 2 hobs (plus extractor fan) and even a washing machine!! Very unusual for a hotel. The room was basically brand new so that added to the greatnesss of it all. I would highly reccomend this hotel to anyone who wants a luxury stay but doesnt want to break the bank. 5/5	
1,2241,May 25 2009 	Hotel Review - Holiday Inn Express Putuo Shanghai	Nice Hotel at an affordable rate in Shanghai. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The breakfast is basic.

2,2243,"Nov 18 2009 	New and nice	This was my first trip to a Holiday Inn for some time and I was positively surprised. The hotel was brand new and of very good quality, not your usual Holiday Inn standard."
3,2243,"Nov 4 2009 	Good mid-range hotel in Pudong	I stayed in this hotel for 6 nights for a business trip. On arrival check-in was fast and efficient. I had travelled to China on an overnight flight, and arrived at the hotel at around 9am in the morning. I was able to check straight-in, and was only charged a half day for the early check-in, and was still offered the inclusive breakfast.The room was of a reasonable size on the 27th floor, and very quiet. Bathroom was also of a reasonable size, with a square two person size tub and overhead shower. The flat screen TV had a good selection of channels, including CNN News channel and BBC World News.Internet is via cable, and charged at 1 RMB/min (up to a maximum charge of 80 RMB in a 24 hour period). Within the room, the power sockets are configured so that they conveniently take British, European and US plugs.Breakfast is served on the ground floor via a buffet, and offers a 50:50 split between western and Chinese cuisines. Overall the selection was good, and the service received was fast and efficient. There is also a chef on both cuisine sides to cater for individual requests.The hotel has few in house restaurants/bars. Flannagans, an Irish bar on the ground floor seems to be popular with single business travellers, and they have a regular live band. Also on the ground floor, where breakfast is served, is another restaurant. However there is no noticeable difference between this restaurant, Flannagans and room service in terms of menu options. I did try a Japanese restaurant on the second floor, which I believe offers a sort of Japanese/fusion experience. So you can order usual Japanese sushi favourites, along with western dishes all shaped in small portions (e.g. potatoes/cheese croquets and egg omelette pieces etc). Location wise the hotel is situated on one of the main roads through the Pudong district, and is a good location if you want to be in the area. However, if you need to be in the financial centre, or the main shopping areas, I would choose a hotel closer to that area (although a taxi journey to and from those districts costs only 2-3) but could take a while if youre travelling in rush-hour and need to use the tunnel connecting both sides of the river.Overall I was very satisfied with the stay at the hotel. If you want to go higher-end then there is a St Regis situated right next door to the Holiday Inn which could be worth considering."
4,2243,"Sep 14 2009 	Great hotel crappy food	Stayed on the 32nd floor, in an awesome room. The best thing was the 2 person bathtub which I enjoyed everynight after walking the dirty streets of Shanghai. The room was very clean and the hotel felt safe. The internet was even reliable, expensive, but reliable.The only down side to this hotel was their food. The room service food was, well, interesting. I ordered pizza, and got one with an egg yolk in the middle even though it didn't say that on the menu. It made me sick even though I scraped the yolk off. The next night they gave me cocoa powder in my pepper shaker. I didn't notice until after I had put it on my noodles.I tried the karaoke bar, which I was the only person there. When I asked if there were other hotel guests there the girl brought out 6 more girls in matching outfits and said &quot;usually girls don't ask for girls&quot; that was NOT what I meant, so I left and went downstairs to the Irish Pub to get a beer and listen to the great treat of a Chinese band doing Van Halen.Other than that, great hotel."
5,2243,"Jul 27 2009 	Great Holiday Inn!	All good, staff, breakfast, rooms and fantastic beds (nice and soft rather than the usually hard beds in most Fast East hotels). We liked this hotel.A little out from the centre but taxis not expensive and lots of local facilities."
6,2243,"Jun 26 2009 	Nicely redecorated almost new hotel	Most of the hotel is newly renovated, they really did a nice job. Rooms are comfortable, beds are good, bathroom excellent with a large shower / bathtub.Some small issues: Internet - you can buy a 24 hour pass, however if during your 24 hours you log off and then on again, you do not get told how much time you have left. Hence I had 4 times 24 hour charges on my bill, but I only used the system 2 days. But with out argue it was taken off the bill. Skype works, but iChat does not, unfortunately.Speed is average.Coffeeshop food is somewhat limited, breakfast also quite limited and expensive for what is offered.BUT I for sure will stay there again. Favourite hotel on the Pudong site."
7,2243,Jun 21 2009 	Good hotel	The Holiday Inn Pudong was a good place to stay during my brief visit of Shanghai in September 2004. From what I remember the rooms were very good (although I was in an Executive room). Good views from the room windows too. Would recommend.
8,2243,"Jun 5 2009 	Good Hotel but careful on the rip off spa service!	Everything was great except the massage service. This is extortion. They should be ashamed of the prices they charged. 6000 RMB is not acceptable for any type of service.Will not stay here again just because of this.Also, I wanted to swim and the pool staff could not answer my question - they didn't speak english and were not willing to explain anything. I didn't end up swimming."
9,2243,"May 21 2009 	Great hotel  Location so-so..	Like everything in life its about the ratio between what you get and what you pay.Lets start from the basics: I stayed paying the hotels weekend rate of about $75 (exclusive breakfast and internet connection) for this price its a deal hard to beat.. (Their official weekday price is $225+)The room was excellent, elegant, clean and comfortable, a desk for work very useful. Breakfast rich and tasty (was not included), the overall hotel (lobby etc) very elegant and nice.Location is so-so, all is accessible by cab, still in the morning rush hour getting to the center can take 35- 45 Min. For vacation or leisure absolutely a steal for less than $100, business traveler consider what it will take in the morning drive. My recommendation, dont hesitate to email or call and try to get if for less than $150 (1000-1200 RMB), for $200+ check and compare with other options.."
10,2243,"May 9 2009 	HI Pudong = Great value for money!	great value for money!clean rooms, good location for business travelers."
11,2243,"Apr 30 2009 	Must be one of the world's best Holiday Inns	From the warmth of the smiles, and the treatment as a special guest of this hotel, the Holiday Inn Pudong stay was darned near perfect. The lobby radiated happy employees. They are well trained and enjoy their jobs. You can tell after just a few moments. So before you even wonder if there is an Priority Club (PC) upgrade or what the room looks like, you feel special.The upgrade was provided. The &quot;Customer Experience Manager&quot; was behind the PC check-in desk and said the management was very happy I decided on their Holiday Inn. He said they were proud of their new rooms and he personally escorted us to the room with the bellman and the bags. (I said to myself, maybe they know I write these reviews, but then after seeing all the recent top five-bullet ratings for this hotel, I realized they just treat their guests right!)The room was superior in the truest sense. A corner room, it was not huge, but comfortable, light and very modern with a huge bath area and tub for two. The staff people remembered my name, albeit in a Chinese way, calling me Mr. Robert throughout my stay. Not just one, but a handful of employees memorize your name or do a really fast check on the computer to make sure they address you personally. Again, they are trained to make you feel special. As a Trip Advisor Destination Expert, I have been in many Shanghai hotels, and this one went all out in customer service.The location in Pudong is a neutral factor in my opinion. You are a short two block walk to subway Line 4, just one stop from Line 2 (downtown and Maglev station to Pudong airport). If you enjoy some good exercise, it is an interesting five to ten minute walk to Century Blvd (Line 2 station), and then down to the Oriental Pearl Tower, Jin Mao and World Financial Center buildings, or up to Century Park. There are plenty of taxis at the front door, something you should not take for granted in busy Shanghai.You are not on the Bund, but then again you are not harassed constantly by touts staked out at every tourist hotel. The Pudong area is modern Shanghai, as safe as can be. Upscale shopping is nearby as well as fashion market shopping at the Technology Museum subway stop.Contrary to another reviewer's comments, there are several nice Chinese &quot;white linen&quot; restaurants within a block. Heji is practically next door, not a storefront but on the 6th floor, and is crowded with locals eating copious amounts of great typical Shanghainese food. Whoops, back to the hotel review...The breakfasts were very good in quality. The hotel's lunch and dinner menus looked very affordable for such a high quality hotel. I will try the in-hotel restaurant next time. The hotel had the fastest internet I have seen in my 12 visits (and maybe 50 hotel stays) in China in the past three years. Lightning fast, just like my DSL at home. It costs 80 yuan, not a bargain but cheaper than some upscale hotels in Shanghai.Which brings me back to the overall quality of the Holiday Inn Pudong. The staff and accommodations will leave no doubt in your mind. You will wish every hotel, not just a Holiday Inn, could reach this outstanding quality."
12,2243,Apr 21 2009 	Shanghai City	the hotel is in the city centre and not very convenient from the business perspective. there are not many eateries around and hence not the likings for a tourist.
13,2243,Apr 17 2009 	Class Holiday Inn	Had been to Nanjing on business trip and had to visit shangai for the weekend. Stayed in the top floor and room offers all facilities. There are weekend prices and the main attraction of the hotel is the staff helpfullness. The hotel is located at Pudong and central to all the shopping places in Shangai. Taxis are very cheap if we stay at Holiday Inn Pudong and had recommended this place to my friends. Offer evening breakfast but then there is a hotel regis where resturants are situated in the ground floor and 38th floor. Food is good made of Olive Oil.Those who wish to visit Shangai should stay in holiday inn Pudong and ask fot the top floor rooms if available. The room is good enough for 2 people and if u need seperate bed you must tell them well in advance. The rooms are very clean and well maintained.
14,2243,"Apr 4 2009 	affraid	I arrives yesterday to holiday inn pudong in dongfang road, very late because my flight was ca1950, maybe at 11 o'clock, I am platinium priority club member then they give to me the room in the executive floor, I was thirsty and I take one bottle of white wine, I didn't notice that the bottle was open before, then I drink it and was pipi, this is incredible, then when I go down to the reception for tell them about the problem, they said maybe I drink the bottle of wine and I don't want to pay, I write to u.s.a. for complain about this and I am still waiting an answer, this hotel is not recomendable, very high price, low quality service. Maybe this page will not accept in the fuorum my complaint but I will write it everywhere."
15,2243,"Mar 29 2009 	Now a very nice hotel	I give this hotel a 5 star rating based on what you get for the price in Shanghai. I am in Shanghai several times each year and I find that this hotel is far better value than the other hotels at which I stay. The hotel has been completely renovated - many of the other reviewers had complaints about the noise during the renovations and I agree with them. I am fortunate that I stay there for business so I was always up before the noise started. The good news is that the construction is finished. The rooms are all newly renovated - The rooms compare to those in other Shanghai hotels which are several times the price. They are very clean, very well designed and everything works. Our group stays here regularly and we find that all of the rooms are now excellent. The restaurant service and food has improved immensely - along with a complete renovation of the restaurant, they also hired a Dutch manager and he seems to have been able to work a miracle in the main western restaurant. The Japanese restaurant on the second floor is still a bit dodgy, so my advice is to avoid that one. They have an Irish bar - Irish name but with a Filipino band - but there is draft guiness and pool tables and it is generally a fun and safe place for a late night drink. Back to why I gave this a five star rating - the staff are always very friendly and helpful and they speak good English. I book this hotel through Priority Club and there is never a problem on check-in and they are generous with upgrades. The hotel lobby and the rooms are always very clean, unlike some very expensive hotels in Shanghai. The hotel is rated as a four star hotel and my experience is that it is a good or better than most of the five star hotels in Shanghai, but at a fraction of the price. I would strongly reccomend this hotel to anybody who is staying in Pudong on business, since it is not in a tourist area."
16,2243,"Mar 13 2009 	They finished remodeling...i think	I think this was my 3rd time at this hotel. When I was there this time, I didn't any jackhammers or saws. However, the hotel next door was under renovation (probably getting ready the world expo in 2010).The hotel's lobby and guest rooms looked more contemporary. I think they also added some more English TV channels as well. The internet speed was so-so. The hotel's restaurants aren't that good IMO. The breakfast buffet is good for Chinese standards, but would probably pass on it if an IHOP was nearby (there's a McDonalds within a 5 min walk). The Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor wasn't good. They served Japanese food that tasted like provincial Chinese food.Room service was still pretty prompt. I ordered spaghetti at 2am, and it took them about 25 minutes."
17,2243,"Feb 24 2009 	Transformed into a first class experience	The renovations have just come to and end and the transformation is fabulous. While the rooms aren't sprawling the careful design gives plenty of room to work and rest. The feeling is now like a 5 star property and not the Holiday Inn that we used to know. With new restaurants, and new club lounge and a whole new feel. Flangans the &quot;Irish Pub&quot; is still there and still a welcome relief and a great meeting place. Staff are friendly and the level of english spoken makes the stay easy. Highly recommended and value for money."
18,2243,"Oct 29 2008 	great hotel if wasn't under contruction	If you want to stay in the pudong area ( ie east of the river and most tourists should stay on the other side, west of the river, getting in between is a pain ) this is an excellent hotel in all aspects exept the 8am to 8pm construction noise, jack hammers all the time. everything else is perfect but you couldn't pay me to stay here again until the consruction is finished.the staff is excellent"
19,2243,"Oct 28 2008 	Hammerjack Inn	We stayed at this hotel for 8 days. From 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening, Saturday and Sunday included, it was a concert of renovation work tools. Impossible to rest in the day time even in the newly renovated room on the 32nd floor. Before booking check that renovation works are 100% over. Otherwise this hotel would be quite comfortable and as usual in Asia the personel is very helpful.Jean-Ren Berg"
20,2243,"Aug 14 2008 	Holiday Inn Pudong great for Western travelers	I traveled to Shanghai alone on business and I knew that staying at a Western hotel chain would be essential. I arrived and had no trouble. The staff spoke english well and were quick to help me get around the city and make recommendations. The rooms and beds are large, which you don't get a lot in China. There was a plate of fresh fruit waiting for me in my room when I arrived. This is a nice touch after a 20 hour flight. Overall, a great place to stay!"
21,2243,"Mar 18 2007 	It's ok.	I stayed here for 3 nights just this week. The hotel is located in the Pudong area, where many new developments in Shanghai are located. We chose the hotel since it is one of the more reasonably priced ones in the Pudong area when our travel agent checked.However what we paid did not include the breakfast which is usually included in most of the hotels i have stayed in. We ended up having to pay approx. USD15-16 for the breakfast. The room size is quite good. There is enough space to move around despite having 2 twin beds and luggage. The bed is comfortable. The toilet is due for renovation. It's still usable but looks dated compared to the room that goes with it. They make up for this by giving a lot of free toiletries like shampoo, combs, etc.What bothered me was that the airconditioning was not working well when we checked into the room. To their credit, the hotel staff promptly came to check when we complained about this. However until the day we left it still was not working properly. I felt that it was a bit warm in the room. We should have asked to be transferred to another room. I guess this did not happen bec. we only were in the room in the evenings after dinner, and since it was quite cold in Shanghai during this time of year, we did not feel hot despite the aircon not working. For the 3 nights i did not use the comforter and just wore a shirt and boxers. The internet connection is not high speed for sure! I paid 80RMB for 24 hour access and the download speed was only around 10 kbps, sometimes up to 15 kbps. This is slow, our office has faster internet connection than that. Thus it's a bit overpriced for me."
22,2243,Feb 26 2007 	Ok not great !!	Stayed here for the secong time in a year. Booked through company policy so gave it a try again. The hotel itself is fine and has a good Irish Bar attached with some pleasant bar food available.Room was adequate but I had a very unpleasant smell which I couldn't locate the source. I will proabably not stay here again and will try other hotels in the area.
23,2243,Dec 29 2006 	Lovely staff	This is a lovely hotel with large rooms and excellent service. The staff have problem understanding English but are very hospitable. I was on the 18th Floor with a lovely view of the city. It is a little distance away from the Bund but you can get a taxi easily to the bund or back. Advise you to carry a card of the hotel in local language as incase you get lost this will be the only method you could come back as local population does not understand English easily.

1,2246,VERY GOOD VALUE	We stayed here 3 nights and we liked hotel with very clean and nice room good view and best service. The price not expensive and good value
2,2246,"Oct 3 2009 	Terrific value	I am from the US and visited Shanghai for about a week. The hotel is geared towards business travelers; the room layout reminded me of Hyatt's back in the states. Room amenities were top notch, as was service. The location was terrific as well. Overall, very good value."
3,2246,"Jul 22 2009 	Hotel Carolina has everything you need for a comfortable stay	Hotel Carolina is on Xinhua Road in Shanghai, which is West of the downtown, Pudong area. Because it is not downtown is is very reasonably priced. I stayed there for a week with some class mates I was taking a course at the Economics school with. The school is about a 5 min. walk away, it was perfect. The metro station West Yan'an rd. is about 10 min. walk. The hotelwas impecably clean, the staff very freindly and the rooms are beautiful. There is AC and internet in every room. each room also has a bar fridge which is nice. The free breakfast is great. AS variety of Chinese food and toast, fruit, coffee, cereal area avail. There are computers with internet in the buiness centre. I can't say anough about how pleased I ws about this place. It is a great value and the service is excellent. Btw if you area a runner it is close to a great park for running called zhongshan park. Go early if you do. Zongshan has a loop trail that is popular with the locals. It isn't a really long loop, but it is much better than running on the sidewalk in full sun."
4,2246,"Jun 14 2009 	Pleasant stay and would definitely come here again!	It was overall a great get-away from everything. It's located in the Chang Nan District of Shanghai... It is within a reasonable distance from most places (20 mins away by taxi). The room was clean and cozy and I loved the bathroom the most! The showers were a comfortable pressure... and they had two shower heads! One is fixed and acts as a rainshower, and the other one is a detachable shower head so that's pretty neat. The toilet was probably one of the better ones I've seen in China for awhile. I honestly didn't pay attention to the beds because for the 3 nights I've stayed here, I slept immediately since I had quite an exhausting travel schedule. There's a driveway and gate that leads you towards the hotel... The hotel is actually 30 meters away from the street so you can imagine how quiet it is. There was absolutely NO NOISE from the streets. There are two convenience stores at both ends of the streets. By the way, the hotel is located near the middle of the street, so no intersections to worry about either. Catching a cab was quite easy as well, as many vacant ones pass by the road quite frequently.The continental breakfast won't make you full but the food's decent, and gives you enough energy to survive until lunchtime. What else is there... Ah yes, places to suggest a foreigner should definitely visit. Of course, the Wai Tan area, and check out Cheng Huang Miao which is a great place to checkout some neat architecture and buy some local goodies, souvenirs, etc... For cheap bargains go to Qing Pu Lu - i bought some ridiculously cheap Giorgio Armani / Burberry London ties for 30 RMB... comes with matching cufflinks and pocket sleeves.. If I gave it to someone as a gift, the person would not even suspect that it would be a replica because it looks that real (maybe it is real?). Anyway, this hotel rocks and I definitely would return again!"

1,2249,"Worth staying and check out the Harvest Moon restaurant	Initially we were not sure when we booked this hotel and our fears were not helped by the lack of correct inforamtion provided by the hotel on subway lines and how to find them.This was further complicated during our stay as the hotel staff were friendly but seemed to not have much useful local knowledge or the information was wrong. Usually they just recommended taking a taxi thereby passing the problem on to someone else!The rooms in the hotel are large, but the walls are thin so you can often hear your neighbours.We stayed at the hotel twice as we did a brief visit to Xi'an and the hotel allowed us to store our luggage for free which meant we only had to take what we needed for a short trip - which was excellent.On our return they upgraded us to a larger room with a tub. Next to the hotel is a restaurant called the Harvest Moon that is worth checking out.The bar of the hotel also allows you to buy a voucher and then it is all inclusive drinks in the bar - it is well worth it.Breakfast at the hotel is plentiful with lots of choice."
2,2249,"Sep 7 2009 	optimal business hotel	Location, setup, facilities, prices, all make for a perfect place to do business. great value and excellent food.Each time, we have stayed for a few days and run a number of client seminars in the conference rooms.Staff are great - right out of 4-seasons training, access to local life (even if it; just a walk &amp; ferry to Pudong is adjacent), and the metro is just 4 minutes walk so one doesn't have to use the very variable Shanghai taxis."
3,2249,"Aug 24 2009	Nice and good hotel	the location is very good, only 100 meters away from the Shanghai Yu garden. Clean and comfortable. The food at the lobby restaurant is specialized in seafood, fresh and delicious!"
4,2249,"Aug 11 2009 	great hotel	What a fantastic hotel,in all aspects.Great location Wonderful staff who go out of there way to help you ,excellent restaurant,why would you want to stay anywhere else."
5,2249,"Mar 25 2009 	Very pleased as usual!!	This is our second two week long stay at this hotel in Shanghai. We are extremely pleased with the exceptional service and wonderful breakfast, and super accomodating staff. Across the street from the Old City, very convienient and very close by taxi to Bund and other attractions. We will be staying there again very soon."
6,2249,"Apr 7 2008	Don't bother	I stayed at Yun's Paradise last weekend with 3 other friends. The hotel is below average in almost every aspect: Location: whilst the hotel is located near the Bund and XinTianDi, (only 5-10 mins away by taxi), it is also located at the intersection of a highway. Cars coming only from ONE direction can make a stop at the hotel. During our stay, we took about 4 taxi rides back to the hotel, and every time we had to stop somewhere near the hotel and walked back. There is no subway station near the hotel. Room: the bed is quite comfortable, and the room is of a decent size. However the room is VERY dim due to inadequate lighting. Service: the front desk is hands down the worst that I've ever encountered in my whole adult life. On two occasions I asked them for directions to two famous restaurants in Shanghai. Not only did they not know anything about the restaurants, they also refused to call the restaurants up for me (i had the number), telling me instead to make the call myself. Business Center: when we walked into the business center one night to use the internet, we found two staff member slouching against the wall smoking cigarettes. No wonder the room smelled so bad. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody."
7,2249,"Mar 12 2008 	Not Paradise but a nice place still...	We decided to try this hotel as the price and location seemed good. In fact, all rooms were freshly renovated and the decoration looked &quot;retro&quot; but gadgets were modern (sensor light switches, LCD flat screen mounted on wall, etc...). Broadband internet was free as in most 3 star hotels across China. The bathroom was not roomy in our piece and we had to use the top of the toilet tank for personal toiletries. We could not ascertain if other room types were better. The location is a little far (by foot) to city center. There was a lot of construction going nearby. If you learn how to move in city buses, it is cheap &amp; convenient: for 2 you can reach Nanjing Street, People's Square, The Bund, and once you reach a metro station you are solved! The closest attraction was Yu''s Garden at 5 minute walking range. Service was &quot;not exceptional&quot; and smiles were not free. There is room for improvement but &quot;overall&quot; it was above standard for a hotel in a big city like Shanghai."

1,2250, helpful and warm. Two minutes walk across Chashu Road
2,2250,so our agent found this. We loved the antiques
3,2250, although the free breakfast got boring on the 3rd day. Same menu every day. Location was great too. It is right by many little shops
4,2250, stay here. I think they have about 20ish rooms all of which are spotless with chocolate wooden floors
5,2250, it is a unique experience. I was travelling on business and stayed for 5 nights.I arranged a pick-up service from Pudong airport
6,2250, and we had to share the bed. But it was clean and the bathroom was reasonable
7,2250, it wasn't worth the extra $$. The room we were transferred to was not only much more intimate and smaller
1,2252,Sep 27 2009 	Best Service ever!!! Incredible Staff	Very helpful staff!! made our stay unforegettable experience.... Well Done!
2,2252,"Aug 27 2009 	Nice and enjoyable business hotel	This hotel is a bargin! Its quite new. Wonderful bed. Nicely decorated room, decent shower."
3,2252,Jul 14 2009 	Best thing - Location. Worst thing - Location	I stayed in this hotel on the business trip. Rooms are comfortable and modern with a nice LCD TV and free wired Internet. Like the bathtub and all the amenities. The hotel is new after all. The only complaint about the room is the air conditioning blows right into your face so I ended up switching off the air conditioning in these hot summer nights. The best part of the hotel as many reviewers mentioned is the convenient location in downtown and near shopping and restaurants and subway. The worst part is also the location. It is at a busy intersection and shanghai drivers lover their horns. So you will be woken up at 6AM whether you like it or not. Also there is a huge construction site across the street so if the traffic does not wake you up the bulldozers and cranes will. Another down side is the elevators on the south end of the hotel is frequently used by staff and housekeeping so expect a long wait. North end elevators are fine.
4,2252,"Jun 28 2009 	Exceeded expectations	The hotel is across the street from Four Seasons and two blocks away from Nanjing Lu. Starbucks is just downstairs and there are 24/h convenient stores, ATM and bakery just a block away. Walking distant to restaurants, DVD stores on Dagu Road and the club, SIN, is across the street. The hotel lobby is new and modern, but hotel staff are slightly weird (one of them couldn't stop staring at me). The room has a comtemporary feel to it and is nice and clean. internet is free, but wired. The room service menu after 11:30pm is sad with just 7 choices. But for RMB 630 nett/night on the weekends, it's a real bargin (Four seasons across the street charge RMB 1700/night +taxes). If you crave a cheaper option stil, check out Hanting Express down Shimen Road for around RMB300/night)"
5,2252,"May 7 2009 	A new concept of suites in the heart of Shanghai...	So many hotels in Shanghai and so many competitors too...Shanghai has everything to propose for spoiled travellers as me...Was very impressed by this hotel especially about the location, cannot find better... located at the opposite of Four Seasons Hotel and at few steps from the famous People Square.Rooms, well we need to say more suites are impeccable, well designed with nice furniture, color shades and excellent amenities, really appreciated the bedding, lighting and the large list of TV channels. The complimentary internet access and Wi Fi thru the hotel is a plus.Staff and services are fine especially security and doormen who will assist you at anytime for a taxi and many things we need when we are in a hotel.Good job and not easy to be different in Shanghai..."
6,2252,"Apr 30 2009 	Not bad for the price and location	I stayed for eight days to visit friends and meet business contacts. I set my expectations low based on limited reviews online. The room rates were reasonable at the time and internet connection was included (wired. no wifi in rooms). The location is across the street from Four Seasons. It's 5 minutes walk to Nanjing Lu subway station. Central enough to walk to most attractions around Shanghai. Its one of the main reasons I selected this hotel versus others of similar quality.Overall, the lobby and facilities are just 'ok'. Nothing grand. The details and the layout seemed a bit off. Once I got into the room however, I was impressed. The room I received looks to be 1 of 2 unique room layouts (see photos). The windows span the length of the room which is very nice. Bathroom details were modern, very nice and clean. Towels were big, soft and comfortable. The bed was great. Sheets and pillows very comfortable. Lounge chair and work desk were well placed, modern and convenient. The windows were operable in the bedroom and bath which allows fresh air (Shanghai Fresh) to circulate. Since I previously lived in Shanghai, I never requested room service or required much assistance. Overall, service was good. I could tell that the people were still being trained and they are trying to maintain high standards. It wasn't perfect (staff at the door were not always personable or outwardly friendly) but the front desk and individual encounters with staff were good. Even the cleaning lady by the elevator greeted us (ni hao) unexpectedly and reveals some training to welcome and greet guests. I'd give special credit to the bell boy (Mr. Smith) for getting the room in order and finding umbrellas during a downpour. The room was well cleaned daily. They never knocked when the do not disturb light was on. The gym is adequate. I used is one of the three treadmills during my stay. The outdoor tennis court was nice. I looked for the basement pool but got lost trying to locate it. Based on the quality of the room, I'd recommend this hotel to friends who were looking for a decent hotel though I caution about the construction across the street.Notes of Caution: (1)There is construction currently in progress in front of the hotel. It looks like its just getting started. Expect some noise. It was tolerable while I was there though it did continue past 10pm. The Four Seasons guest also have to put up with the same thing but they're probably paying at least 2x more. (2) There is a whiskey lounge bar next door (same building but separate entrance). Although its on the ground floor, you can hear singing and music up to the 20th floor. (3) all rooms seem to allow smoking. There was no odor in my room though this may change as it seeps into the carpet and curtains. (4) The signage &quot;Howard Johnsons&quot; is tiny. Coming from the airport, you might not know you have arrived at the right location since even taxi drivers are just getting familiar with the hotel name."
7,2252,"Mar 26 2009 	Practical business hotel reasonably convenient with limited amenities	Convenience - doesn't even offer the most basic service of currency exchange, staff said the hotel has `just opened' in December so service wasn't ready yet, though it's already been three months. Location - none of the cab drivers recognized the name of the hotel. Better tell them it's opposite Four Seasons Hotel. Don't expect much to see around the area for shopping/sightseeing. Restaurant - getting lunch/dinner is a problem. only one restaurant (cafe) in the entire hotel, which serves buffet breakfast. Dinner is not impressive at all - below average Western and Asian dishes with a three-page menu. Disappointing for the price charged at a four-to-five-star hotel. Starbucks right next door.Hotel staff said there are cheap food stalls selling local snacks within 5-10 mins walk. Haven't seen for myself though.Service - Marco at the concierge was exceptionally helpful. Offered to help my family to buy a meal from local restaurants nearby. Brought back scrumptious food within 10 mins. On another instance, I was trying to check a boutique that I saw in Beijing but a staff only asked me to look around local department stores without offering more help. Deluxe rooms aren't spacious at all, looking over new residential building. But a clean, nice bathroom compensated part of that.Huge plus is all guests are required to insert room key in the elevator to access to all floors to ensure security. If you are just looking for a safe, comfortable place to stay and dont require much amenities, go for this one.Taxi to hotel from airport costs about RMB 150."
8,2252,Sep 25 2009 	Buon hotel ma un p fuori mano
1,2256,Nov 14 2009 	Fantastic view	The room was large with a small seating area (two small armchairs with footrests) and a fantastic view over looking the Bund and Pudong. It was fun watching the boats drift by on the river. At night all the buildings are lit up which is fun and you get a wonderful view from the rooftop bar. The bed wasn't too bad or maybe I had acclimatised to hard beds after nearly three weeks in China. However they had the hardest pillows of the entire trip! I found the light switches bewildering. I was unable to turn the lights on in the bathroom or loo on the first night. The light switches are on almost every wall and what makes it even more difficult is that you have to press them in a certain way for them to turn on. So no wonder it is so hard to find the right one. The loo blocked on the first night but it was fixed the following day and thereafter worked fine. There was no shaving/vanity mirror and the sink was a little small with the tap slightly too close to the bottom of the sink but that's just the modern style. There was a nice big flat screen TV and a DVD player which played region 2 DVDs (Europe) which was very nice as well as an MP3 player. Typically internet access in their business centre was NOT free which is surprising given the cost of the room but seems standard in China. Also
2,2256,Nov 1 2009 	Best view in town	The riverside of the Bund is in complete construction and won't be ready until the World Expo 2010. Unless you are willing to walk through the construction

25,2256,Apr 6 2008 	Good but let down by location and layout	Stayed here for 3 nights after a work conference at the Shangri-La. A number of other people have already said they had trouble getting their taxi driver to find the Hyatt
26,2256,Jan 15 2008 	what's happened to the service	I stayed at this hotel as my friend was having his birthday party there on the Saturday night so it made sense. Check in was very slow as they only had us checking in for 1 night rather than 2 but as the hotel was empty it wasn't too much of a problem.Went for brunch to Aroma
27,2256,Jan 9 2008 	Hyatt did it again...on the Bund!	It is located at the north end of the Bund on a quiet street facing the Pu River; if you book a room with the River view
28,2256,Jan 5 2008 	Nice views but poor bathroom	Am writing this review while sitting in the hotel room. I wanted to try out this new hotel since some of my friends had stayed here and gave good reports.The hotel is in the so-called North Bund area
29,2256,Dec 7 2007 	A new Hyatt with spirit	We stayed at Hyatt on the Bund for five nights in November including the official opening night - the &quot;soft start&quot; period is over and they opened more facilities including the level 32 bar (with great night views)
30,2256,Nov 21 2007 	High Style in Shanghai	Hyatt on the Bund

32,2256,Sep 25 2007	Coolest hotel I've stayed in	What a hotel! Only open a couple of months (and there are signs that it's in the soft launch phase) so everything is brand new. My bedroom
33,2256,Sep 23 2007 	Best view in the entire Shanghai	If city shyline view is your fancy
34,2256,Aug 14 2007 	Wow!	We extended our stay to four nights because of 1. the view

1,2266,"Nov 4 2009 	Happy stay	Hotel very clean and breakfast very good. Easy access to the main road outside, watch out for the scammers though"
2,2266,Oct 3 2009 	Service	Poor service for a hotel that I expected to be world class.
3,2266,"Aug 12 2009 	Brilliant location for shops and sightseeing.	Large room, nice toiletries. clean bathroom. We stayed on the 18th floor so good view of other skyscrapers. Hotel has precipitous view over central balconies to the 7th floor below. Rooms are round the edge and space in centre of hotel from 7th to 25th floor. swimming pool on 7th floor looked good but we didn't have our swimming caps with us so could not go in. Probably could have bought one but we didn't ask. Breakfast buffet was a good selection of varying cuisines.Excellent location as on main high street for shopping although you get harassed the minute you walk out by people trying to sell you stuff. Can walk to the Shanghai museum about 30 mins and also to the river. The sightseeing tunnel to the Bund is an interesting underground monorail with a light show on the way. Shops stay open till 9.30 and a little electric train runs up and down the highstreet if your feet get tired. 2 yuan for a single journey"
4,2266,Feb 26 2009 	Great Location ; Not Very Impressive Hotel	This hotel is great for its location ; pricewise it's moderate in comparison to the other offerings along Nanjing Road. I booked the Deluxe room and it comes with a nice sitting room area ; furnishings are very old in design although well maintained. The room is very big and decent for the RMB 1100 I paid.Check in is efficient. The biggest selling point is the location. The hotel is right in the middle of the Nanjing Road shopping area and is great for exploring the area. THere is a better alternative that i stayed at Citadines Jinqiao...read that review ! Breakfast is good and normal. Overall you paid for the location and the price is fair for an old hotel although very very clean and well maintained.
5,2266,"Feb 14 2009 	Tried the Ramada Plaza for a Change	I've been to Shanghai many times and have usually stayed at the Hyland Sofitel. That hotel recently raised its prices fairly dramatically with no apparent added benefits to guests - so, on this trip, I decided to stay at the Ramada Plaza (just up the road).Tried to book it through the Ramada website and couldn't - the reason being, as I found out, was that while it retained the &quot;Ramada&quot; branding, it had been sold to a Chinese company sometime ago and was no longer part of the Ramada chain.So I booked it through my travel agent at a slightly better price than the Sofitel.I arrived around noon. Check-in was extremely smooth and fast - after a long flight from Melbourne - that was a blessing. I'd booked, for 7 nights, a room with a double bed on a smoking floor. The bed was a pleasant surprise - king-size and, while being firm, was nowhere near the rock-hardness that characterise beds in most Asian hotels. I slept very well.All rooms are positioned around a central atrium which is quite pleasant as you enter or leave your room. Security is good as you must use your key-card in the elevator to go to your room - put the key into the slot and the elevator knows your floor and does the rest.The room, itself, was extremely clean, the bathroom standard for a 4-star hotel and, while quite comfortable and spacious, will need to be updated in 2-3 years' time if this hotel is to keep its star rating.A nice touch is the free wi-fi internet which worked well. The Sofitel (and many others) charge around $20 per 24 hours for internet access, so this made the margin in price between the Ramada and the Sofitel even greater.For english-speaking guests, the TV had limited channels - CNN, HBO National Geographic, CCTV9 and Channel News Asia. As with most hotels, they should, at least, have BBC World,Australia Network and Star Movies on their list. I didn't eat at the hotel - I seldom do in Shanghai. Breakfast was not included. There are SO many good, cheap eateries around the hotel area, why pay silly prices within the hotel itself??I had a problem with the in-room safe - the response from staff was prompt, courteous and, while the first person's english was limited, she quickly called up a senior person who arrived within minutes, spoke very passable english and solved the problem very quickly.I stayed in February 2009, so the air cond was turned off - that's standard in most hotels here at this time of year. However, after opening the windows, had no trouble sleeping, My room was on the 19th floor so I had no street noise to disturb me.The location: you really can't ask for better in Shanghai. You're right on Nanjing Road East pedestrian mall and a three minute walk from Peoples Square subway station which is a central hub of the subway system and will get you pretty much everywhere cheaply and quickly. SIgns, tickets machines and announcements in the trains themselves are also in english - so the system is easy to use - as well as being clean and efficient. For those places where the subway doesn't reach, use a taxi - they're still quite cheap here.Would I stay here again? After comparing rates at the Sofitel and the new Grand Central Hotel across the road, then, most likely, yes I would."
6,2266,"Nov 29 2008 	Rude Check in No Cold Aircon only heat.	I checked into the hotel at 8pm after a long flight and long taxi ride. Taxi arrived bellboys did not help me with my luggage. Went up to the receptionist to get my room, there was nobody in front of me and she did not serve me until I asked if this was the front desk check in. Booked a king bed smoking room, but they said that they were out of kings and the only thing they had was a twin bed room. Then she had the gall to rudely tell me if I wanted it or not. Fine it was pre-paid so I took it, if it wasnt I would have walked right out due to her attitude. Asked for the assistant manager to come talk to me and he was just as rude as her. Go up to my room to find out that there was no internet connection besides wireless (my wireless adapter on my computer is broken) Call the assistant manager and he tells me to deal with it and that there was nothing they could do. even though the front desk told me there were rooms with wired connections. The room condition was appalling, the toilet had mold growing all over, the bed was rock hard, I ended up sleeping on the sigle seater sofa, which smelled bad. Finally the last straw was no cold airconditioning at night. Only heat... I called down and they said open the windows nothing they can do. Opened the windows to people screaming on the road. Paid for 2 days I left the first morning at 10 after 4 hours of sleep. Checked into the hotel next door which is great compared to that dump."
7,2266,"Sep 25 2008 	Great Location Good Hotel	The location is right on Nanjing Road Pedestrian Mall - which is both good and bad. You are right in the middle of things, but traffic can be very bad. It is walking distance to many things - and a short taxi ride to others.I stayed on the Executive floor (23rd) and had a nice large-ish room with large bathroom and jacuzzi. Water pressure in the shower was only average. Fresh fruit was delivered on arrival. The housekeeping staff were very attentive. The view was looking down Nanjing Road to The Bund, so very good! Access to the floor was by your room key into the slot in the elevator - no need to press the floor button - it does it for you.The Executive Lounge is on Level 25. Breakfast was included in the room price, but was only average at best - nothing to rave about.The doormen were always helpful with directions and flagging a taxi down, even during peak times it was only a short wait for a taxi.Overall I liked the hotel. Was not cheap, but was very convenient and a good hotel to stay in. It wasn't excellent, but was definitely above average."
8,2266,"Jul 28 2008 	Best value/location!	I stayed here last year, on recommendation by Tripadvisor users. There were a few negative comments at the time, but it seemed to be the nicest vs. affordable hotel in a great tourist location for my last minute decision to check out the Bund. My expectations were average. This turned out to be a fantastic hotel, and I enjoyed every second of the stay. Check in was fast and simple, and in English; and they took care of my taxi request for departure immediately. I checked in at about 10pm, so I expected to get a &quot;leftovers&quot; room. To my surprise, I was upgraded to a suite. It was impeccably clean and comfortable with a great shower and decent view. After 2 weeks of Chinese food (which is my favorite, but..) I chose to have dinner at a little steak joint across the street. I had to take a rickety elevator to the second floor, so I was a little scared. The doors opened to a beautiful, quiet, Western-style steakhouse, where I had a delicious and affordable grilled steak with prawns and a glass of wine. I'm so happy I decided to stay at the Ramada Plaza."
9,2266,"Jun 24 2008 	Very good place	We really enjoyed our stay in the Ramada. Our travel guides booked this hotel for us, and when we arrived we were pleased. The hotel lobby is welcoming and the concierge have maps and advice to hand out.Cabs were easy to come by from the front of the hotel and we had everything we needed during our stay.The room was clean, and everything worked well.If you want a &quot;no worries&quot; stay then book here and relax."
10,2266,"Jun 8 2008 	Best bet under $200	The Ramada was a bit hard to find the first day - but well worth the effort. (warning: I received multiple map locations from different sources which showed the WRONG location.) The Ramada is located next to the Royal Mridien, with the rear entrance to the lobby directly on Nanjing Rd (the pedestrian shopping boulevard). The location is exceptional!The lobby is very impressive with lots of marble and classic design. Shops, caf, travel agency, airline office, bakery, business center, etc. in lobby. The buffet restaurant has an excellent selection of Asian, American and European foods. I really liked both the breakfast and dinner buffets (about 400CNY). There is also a classic Thai restaurant in the hotel. (theres a Subway restaurant located on the outside of the hotel lobby)My room was amazing. Large, clean, well equipped - slippers, robes, mini-fridge, coffee, desk, sofa and chair, etc. The bathroom had a separate soaking tub and glass shower area. The room had wireless internet and good signal strength (four bars). I booked a King Bed Superior Room for 900CNY (about $150USD) through the Ramada.com web site, and then got 10% discount for AARP or AAA. I arrived at the hotel at 9AM and they gave me a free upgrade to a King Bed Suite (1,170CNY)The Ramada is designed with the rooms around an open atrium, so each floor can see Roof to Lobby. The service and staff were excellent. Minor warning: I woke up to a persistent beeping noise (like someone text messaging on a phone in my room) which turned out to be the in-room safe had &quot;low&quot; batteries. When I contacted hotel service, they knew what was causing the sound and fixed it immediately.Overall, the Ramada was a great location - the lobby had a rear access to the tourist area and shopping district. The food and rooms and service were excellent. A GREAT value for under $200 (including free Wi-Fi!)"
11,2266,"May 8 2008 	Good Location in Shanghai	We stayed in Ramada Plaza Shanghai for 2 nights. The hotel is not new since it was a local hotel before it was changed to Ramada Hotel. It is located in Nanjing Road East which is the pedestrian street of Shanghai. Nanjing Road East is were you can find local foods, stuff and products. It is one of the most most visited area in shanghai. The room rate is not bad considering shanghai is one of the most expensive cities in asia. There are other hotels located in different area in shanghai and choosing a hotel will depend on what you like. The french concessioner area is where you can find luxury items. The Pudong area is the business hub of Shanghai. The Nanjing East area is where you will find chinese local products. The size of the rooms in this hotel are bigger than newer hotels in shanghai. Many of the hotel staff knows how to speak english and are always ready to help you on your needs."
12,2266,"Apr 22 2008	Worst Experience with staff at Beauty Salon and overall service	I was very dissapointed with this hotel as a couple of things happened. First of all, after a long flight, I wanted to make a phone call to the beauty spa to enquire about the massage services. There were 2 different phone numbers in their phone directory, and both didn't work! I was firstly connected to the dim sum restaurant, and the 2nd number connected me to their housekeeping department. I called the reception to ask them to transfer me to their beauty spa...and it still connected me to the dim sum restaurant!!After lots of frustration, I went down myself and made appointment for a 45 min shiatsu massage costing RMB 200. The price was written down on the front desk menu very clearly in English. However, in the massage room, after approx 15 mins, I suspected that the massage therapist was not giving me a shiatsu massage. I asked her what massage she was doing....and after a few minutes, I found out that she was giving me a Massage costing RMB 480 and lasting 90 minutes!!! I asked her what the name of the massage was and she answered me &quot;test&quot;....I didnt even understand what she was talking about and I told her I actually wanted SHIATSU, she said she didn't know what that was, and also the hotel DID NOT offer this massage!!! I was so angry, because the Shiatsu massage was clearly written down in the front desk menu!!! I complained this to a guy who looked like he was a manager of the spa. He merely asked the lady to come out to the front desk and explain...and I could not even understand their chinese accent even when I speak mandarin fluently myself! He later used a very threatening tone and said to me: &quot; YOU SHOULD understand that these girls do not understand what Shiatsu is, and the Thai massage she gave you was similar anyway!&quot; Then I asked: &quot;why did the girl at the front desk tell her to give me 90 mins when I requested for only 45 mins.&quot; He replied: &quot;the girls at the front desk do not tell the massage therapist what the customers wants. YOU have to tell the massage lady what you want directly!!!&quot; I was soooo angry at what he said, but I did not want to make a huge scene just in case. I just paid and left. However, I just want to warn everyone that this is the worst service a hotel could ever offer as a 5-star rated hotel. TERRIBLE!!!!"
13,2266,"Feb 22 2008 	Excellent location	If you want to see much that Shanghai has to offer, then this is the perfect location, close to People's Square. Ignore the hustlers on Nanjing Road and walk off into the side streets and work your way down to the Bund or go across to the Museum. My hotel room was very large and had everything I needed, - free and fast internet access, powerful shower, comfortable bed. Great views over the city too (especially as it was covered in snow). Negatives: the hotel lobby is soulless and I found the front desk staff a bit cold."
14,2266,"Jan 8 2008 	Great location - easy access	Booked flight hotel package with Cheaptickets over the Christmas holidays - very good price for a 5 day stay from the Westcoast. Location right on Nanking Road near People's Park was perfect. Easy access from the airport on the Maglev train to the Number 2 tram and the Nanking East station - best to get off here right on the pedestrian street than figure your way around all the People's Park interchange, even though on the map it looks closer. When you get out of the underground station, turn to your right and head up Nanking Road (you will see the spaceship Radisson Hotel on the horizon) and walk a few blocks to the hotel. There is no sign indicating it is the Ramada from Nanking Road pedestrian walk, so look for its distinctive roof line from the street and you will find it, it is right before the Meridian Hotel on your left as you walk towards People's Park.The biggest problems with this hotel was not honoring the &quot;free breakfasts&quot; promised by Cheaptickets. They would only honor one even though we made a double reservation. They charged $20 US for the second breakfast, while a nice buffet definitely not worth it. I had tried to confirm this with Cheaptickets ahead of time to insure they knew the offer included free breakfasts, and was assured by CT this was the case, but it was not. So don't make your decision about getting the free breakfast unless you are traveling solo. This was a disengenuous offer and I also fault Cheaptickets for their part in continuing this fraud as well.Also even though we upgraded to a studio room, which was very nice, there were no drawers in any of the cabinets. This was very awkward as all things had to lay on the floor of the cabinets where I was looking forward to unpacking once and having everything easily available for our 5 day stay. The room was lovely, quiet and even elegant so the lack of drawers was a bit of an oddity.But beyond those two glitches, the rest of the stay was wonderful to be in this location. Loved eating at South Beauty, did not care for Shanghai Uncle, and had an okay meal at the Meridian next door. Great dumpling and snack place right across the street and upstairs at Daniang Dumplings which is a sign near the Shanghai First Food Store across the street which has fried dumplings and really a treat to wander around and see the huge variety of every sort of Chinese food stuffs right on Nanking Road.Special places to visit close by of course are the Bund, the Pedestrial Tunnel to Pudong, People' Park, Shanghai Museum, and the Shanghai Development Exhibit all within a few blocks radius from the hotel.Don't be afraid to use the metro and best to get a card for multiple rides which you can purchase putting a certain amount on the card so you can use it until it is finished and not have to keep buying single tickets. They want a deposit for the card so you buy if for more than the value of the total rides, but it is so cheap don'teven worry about not turning it back in. I got two 50RMB cards ( total approx $20) and we did not use them all up in 4 days and just left them at the station when we were done, and ready to ride the Maglev back to the airport."
15,2266,Nov 2 2007 	Good Value for a Western Style Hotel	Not a top flight international hotel but clearly better than an average Ramada in North America. The rooms and the lobby were quite good and the location was excellent. An easy and cheap (but exciting) cab ride from most of the key destinations.Reasonable value for what you got. One would easily pay this and more for a similar hotel in North America. I didn't eat in the hotel because I never find hotel restaurants to be worth the effort or the price. Lots of options around the hotel within easy walking distance. I would recommend this hotel.
16,2266,Oct 28 2007 	Can't do better	This has it all. It is worthy of all its five stars. Rooms are good. Lobby is elegant. Location is tops. It is on the main shopping street and steps away from the metro where you can go 7 stops for 52 cents and connect with the world's fastest train that gets you to the Podong airport 30 km (19 miles) in eight minutes at 431km/hour (270mph) for USD6.50!
17,2266,Sep 26 2007	Very convenient location reasonable service and good comfort	We stayed in this hotel 2 nights in september 2007 and were very favourably impressed by the comfortable room and the excellent location next to the pedestrian zone with lots of activities until late in the night. Excellent breakfest and service.We can just recommand to anybody looking for a comfortable hotel in Shanghai.
18,2266,"Sep 17 2007 	Central location average hotel	We have stayed for 3 nights in this hotel. Check-in and check-out was very good and fast. Breakfest was very good and we liked the style.Room service was okay and the room had average size and was clean and furniture was in good conditons.The pool was very nice and even big. Fitness centre was well equipped.Take care on your room safe as it runs with batteries. If the batteries are empty ... they can only be changed when the safe is open.Nanjing Road is not so nice, as there are many watch-bag-dvd-deales. You will not like it."
19,2266,"Jul 22 2007 	Bad check-in experience	This hotel is very conveniently located, and the rooms are nice and comfortable. We had a bad checkin experience -- we had booked two rooms (for our family of 4) and requested one to have a king size bed and when we arrived none were available. They had other rooms with king size beds but would not give them to us because they were more expensive. A supervisor also could not remedy the situation. Overall our stay was not as comfortable as it should have been and this left a bad impression of the hotel service overall."
20,2266,"May 22 2007 	horrible	The lobby is nice,rooms are average.However the food, in particular breakfast , aside of having few choices, what was astonishing was finding a cockroach walking in the bread station. The staff was informed and the only action was to laugh among them, and later on advised us that the cockroach had been killed, no apologies or concern for the hygiene were shown.I will never stay here again!!!"
21,2266,"May 4 2007 	Laughable service	I stayed here for a night on a business trip in April. First impressions were of a grand but rather tasteless foyer. Check-in was a disaster. I was told there was no reservation for me. I showed them confirmation code and reservation details on my PC. The front desk manager was unable to find any trace of it, and told me that if it had been booked through the internet by the agent, they might not have it. So even if you have a confirmation no., it does not mean you will get a room! The manager left after 15 mins to &quot;check with sales&quot;. Iw was another 15 mins before one of the hotel reception clerks took the initiative to allocate a room and issue me with a key regardless of reservation status. More shockingly, another guest walked in and sufered the same fate whilst I was waiting. I asked about a colleague who was scheduled to arrive later than me, and his reservation had been cancelled! My issue is that even if there is a serious hiccup, or a systemic problem, guests should not be kept waiting for half an hour (I timed it) at the front desk. Service in the main cafe/restaurant was also full of hiccups. I ate there for dinner as I had arrived late, and for lunch the next day as I had meetings in the hotel. I asked for a coffee after lunch, and was told it was not included in the price of the buffet lunch. I told them I would pay for it, but it still took ages to arrive. I also noticed that the food served at lunch and dinner was identical! Thankfully rooms in the hotel are more representative of this grade of hotel. The room was clean, furnishings are average, and everything worked OK. I do not intend to stay here again."
22,2266,"Apr 13 2007	Great Service!!Great Hotel!	I've stayed in this hotel 3 times. Every time the rooms have been great, the breakfast is nice, the amenities in the rooms are wonderful, love the shower!, clean, friendly staff, etc. The last time my friend and I stayed we asked for several things from the staff and each request was met with courteous, speedy action. Very please. Also a great location."
23,2266,"Mar 24 2007 	Do not stay here you will be very sorry	I booked my reservation for Ramada Plaza based on a recommendation. I do not know what the person was thinking who said to stay here--the service is atrocious, the maintenance is terrible, it is noisy, and very very expensive for what you get. Here's what I experienced: requested quiet, non-smoking room--got put in a smoking room next to hotel construction; bath towel was actually dirty (hair on it); air conditioning non-functional and maintenance unwilling to do anything to fix it; rooms have both noise from hotel and from street (even on 24th floor); workout room dismal and overheated; room sink was clogged up when I got in the room; asked concierage to book us tickets for Shanghai Circus World, instead he booked us at a 4th rate show in a run-down theater in a scary part of town at an extremely high rate; the maps they give out are outdated and missing huge chunks of the subway system and are not to scale in parts; no English spoken or understood for anything. Upon any of the issues above being explained to the desk (in English OR Chinese), there was no response or help. I would really like to save other visitors the extreme pain of wasting their money and time here (we had one night to see the circus and missed it because of the imcompentent concierage). Stay somewhere, anywhere else!! By the way, we stopped at the Radisson for help and the concierage was terrific, hotel is beautiful, staff is friendly (what a change!), location is very good, and I would try that in a heartbeat."
24,2266,"Mar 19 2007 	If you do not need service o.k.	This hotel is not a service-oriented one. Apparently owned by government most of the staff are students with not a lot of training and hardly any visable service-orientation and language skills. The hotel however is clean and the rooms also. We had a meeting there with customers and there were no complaints about bad rooms etc., but when it comes to service, the hotel makes a bad performance, especially in the banquette department. The servants could not speak and understand any English, there were 20 cups for 40 partcipants for coffee, the air condition did not work for 5 days although we complaint several times, the general managers was invisible and his staff just not responding. Near our meeting rooms was heavy construction going on and we had hardly any help from the staff to get our meeting going. It took a lot of effort to get what we wanted and this was nothing extraordinary. So if you just need a comfortable bed and nothing else, the hotel is o.k. , the breakfast buffet is fine, the restaurants are also o.k. The location is very good, you can reach most of the tourist attraction by foot. If you expect more service and friendly staff go to the Royal Meridien next door, here you find everything you want at a slightly higher price, however. Their bar there on the 66th floor is amazing. Drinks and food are excellant at European prices."
25,2266,"Jan 19 2007 	You will enjoy	This is a great hotel with a fantastic location for both business and tourism. Rooms are great, beds are firm but nice (I've had some bad experiences with rock hard beds) lobby and facilities are top class and you can't beat the location. You are right in the heart of the action quick walk east and your at the bund, shopping a plenty right out the front door and a quick walk west and your in Renmin square with all the arts, museums, gardens and hotels. Cabs are frequent along the road adjacent the hotel. Great value for tourists especially and the business centre really came in handy for me as I was running a seminar at the time"
26,2266,"Jan 19 2007 	GREAT hotel	Helpful staff, great location, walking distance to the Bund (Peace Hotel and M), right ON the major shopping pedestrian street Nanjing Donglu...theres a convenience store right across Nanjing st (so you can avoid the very overpriced minibar), a Pizza hut as well within feet of one entrance should you crave some western food...A subway within a couple of blocks, etc etc...Super-clean rooms with a flower in the bathroom, with all the HBO, CNN, etc. (and coffee packets in the room! A rarity in China!). Our friend's room on the 17th floor was pristine and beautiful, brand new, felt like a true 4 star, ours on the 19th was not as newly renovated and showed a little wear, but still excellent. Would definitely stay here again. Great place, our room even had somewhat of a view of the river and Pudong....at an amazing place when you factor in the price!"
27,2266,"Dec 29 2006 	Very nice hotel	I spend 2 nights in this hotel at the beggining of December.It is a huge hotel at the center of the town, only a few meters from the main shopping street, Nanjing Road. The hotel is very clean, with all comforts and the price was great."
28,2266,"Nov 6 2006 	Sleepless at Ramada	i just got back from China with my entire family of 16. It was my first trip to Shanghai together with my 12 year old daughter and we were booked at the 8th floor of the hotel which we were later told was the floor preferred by newly weds. The first night was a bit noisy because the newly weds were having games in the hallway! On our fourth night, the couple beside our room was quarelling quite violently. It was terrifying because it came to a point that they were banging the walls like they were going to come through it. Later, someone was banging our door and trying to open it. I had to call the assistant manager, front desk and concierge several times because the commotion would not stop. It was so so so terrible, horrible! They had to physically drag out the couple. When my daugter and I had finally got to doze off, someone knocks in our room at 12:38 am. Scared, I had to go to the door to find out who it was. It was a hotel staff asking if I requested a change. I was quite confused as to what change I wanted and at that time of the night! The following day, my sister-in-law wrote a letter of complaint to management and we personally submitted it. When we returned to check if we could talk to the manager, we were so shocked to see a torn letter held by the assistant manager! They probably did not want the complain to reach the general manager. There were no sincere apologies, just a cheap offering of 5 small cookies on a dinner plate with a bowl of fruits tied with a recycled ribbon! The hotel has great breakfast buffet and an excellent location! If they can polish their relationship with their guests, I do not mind going back and living there on my next vacation but as for now, I would consider other hotels where my family and I will feel secure! Peace of mind is, after all, one of the reasons for a vacation!"
29,2266,"Oct 31 2006 	Very good	This Ramada is better than the ones I've used in America. Helpful, friendly staff, nice rooms and in a great location for exploring on foot or underground."
30,2266,"Oct 13 2006 	Nice Hotel / So-So Area	HotelI was apprehensive about staying in a Ramada brand hotel because my experiences with them in the US have been totally poor. However, this Shanghai Ramada is genuinely a 4 star hotel with good service and English speaking concierge. The room was spacious and clean. Staff was friendly. There was security staff on the first floor at all times. It is 1 hour taxi ride (140 yuan) from Pudong International Airport.AreaThe area is on the pedestrian mall area of East Nanjing Road. Very unfortunately this is a major tourist area and touts are out in full force. You cannot take two steps without being stopped and offered bags, watches, or women. It is not an enjoyable place to stay. There is zero nightlife there. The more up upscale area on West Nanjing Road near Portman Center and Shanghai Hilton hotel is a much better place to stay. There is better dining, nightclubs, bars there and less beggars and touts.Nearby Dining/ShoppingCabs are cheap so every shop and restaurant is in reach. Good spicy food with good service is at Meilongzhen Restaurant. We dined at Shanghai Uncle at the Westin Hotel but the food and service was terrible. If you plan to visit YuYuan Garden you should eat at Shnghai Lao Fndin (Old Shanghai Restaurant) and a visit to Shanghai would not be complete without experiencing the wonderful view/food from the balcony at M on the Bund. We went to KaDe Club video shop and loaded up on DVDs for cheap though there authenticity is questionable."
31,2266,"Sep 23 2006	Hotel Nice - Major Check in problems	I recently booked three rooms at the Ramada Plaza Shanghai with the Ramada Reservation desk. While making the reservation, I was informed that the hotel had a special package which included free laundry, free in room broadband service and a free buffet breakfast. This package was $10 USD more than the rate posted on the internet. I went ahead and booked this package.At check in, the hotel refused to honor the package. They said that they did not participate in the package and that they had informed Ramada International. They would upgrade the room, but would not include any of the items noted in the package that I had booked. After going through three levels of management, they eventually agreed to provide the breakfast and broadband access from the business center. The hotel itself was very nice. The two room suite was nicely decorated and quite comfortable. There was a bit of noise from outside, but that was to be expected due to the location of the hotel.The hotel is located on a busy tourist street (Nanjing Lu). The Bund area and the Huangpu River is approximately a fifteen minute walk. In the opposite direction, one can reach the museum area as well as the metro in approximately 5-10 minutes.The service level was somewhat disappointing as compared to the other hotels we stayed in throughout China."
32,2266,"Aug 5 2006 	Great stay	Location: excellent, right in the centre of where you want to be in ShanghaiRooms: spacious, well equipped, very cleanStaff: very helpful and friendlyRestaurant: the breakfast was disappointing, but okValue: its somewhat expensive (staying on the Club floor is NOT worth it)Recommend staying at this hotel"
33,2266,"Jul 12 2006	Great Staff and Location	My family rented two rooms for 4 days at the end of June 2006. The location was excellent, right on Naijing pedestrian mall with lots of new shops, restaurants and new building. The Bund is a 15 minute walk to the river and sights of the spectacular Pudong skyline.The hotel was 4 star was the usual modern and western amenities. Several restaurants and a upper floor executive lobby overlooking the city.The front staff was very helpful and spoke English. I want to compliment an excellent concierge names Mr. William Shen, who helped us way beyond the call of duty. He accompanied us to a nearby dim sum restaurant to help us orders from a Chinese language only menu - kudos to Mr. Shen.On the down side, internet access was expensive and health club charges were very deceptive. The hotel manager tried to intervene but told me the club is run separately from Ramada. Although the fitness equipment, pool, showers, spa were excellent, there are no indications that using the sauna was an extra charge (the spa next to it was free for guest). There are many English language signs at the front desk of the health club with charges, but nothing that said the sauna was extra $10 dollars per person. Also my son and I was forced to buy a $12 swimming cap for the pool because those were the written rules. But to our surprise, many people using the pool had no swim cap! So, don't let the nice lady at the front cheat the &quot; rich Americans&quot;.That was the only unpleasant experience of our trip. Caution: China is still a very poor country and there many beggars and shady character out after 10 pm on the Mall and elsewhere outdoors. You will be swarmed if they know you are a tourist."
34,2266,"Jul 1 2006	Great Location and Great services	I stayed at Ramada Plaza Shanghai in May of 2004 for 5 nights for vacation. Check in was a breeze. The receptionist of the front desk was very friendly. I was upgraded to a suite as soon as he discovered that the type of room my travel agent booked for me was not available. My room was specious with a small living area though it was a little dark with only one small window. The bath room was fantastic with a large Jacuzzi. It was built with all marbles. House keeping was excellent. My room was always cleaned in a pefect manner. The location of this hotel certainly is the best for a leisure traveler. It is within walking distance to most attractions, such as the Bund, Nanjing Road, Legendary Peace Hotel, Peoples squares, etc There are plenty good and cheap eats as well as many large department stores and smaller shops around the neighborhoods. My breakfast was included in the room rate. Food was good, service staff was pleasant. However, all the guests had to find an available table ourselves. The restaurant was so packed with large tour groups during the breakfast time (7am to 10am). It was a bit struggle to find a table every morning. I had to share my table with strangers a few times. One thing you need to be aware. This hotel has two entrances. One entrance is on JiuJang Road, the other one is on East Nanjing Road. This could be the only hotel in Shanghai that has two addresses. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay. It is good value for money. I would definitely stay there again."
35,2266,"Apr 7 2006	Ramada Plaza a good experience overall!	A very well location hotel in a very busy and hectic city.The hotel is located on the main shopping street of Shanghai and is well located for walking to any of the major tourist sights and also the very good underground system.The hotel facilities are very good and the staff are both efficient and friendly. The breakfast and the restaurant food is fairly typical of your average hotel and is nothing to write home about. The accomodation, particularly the suite accomodation that we had on our trip, was spacious, clean and well equipped. Overall I was pleased enough with the hotel and would not discount using it again, however I would probably look to see what else was available in the same price range."

2,2269,Jun 23 2009 	Very nice apartments near PuDong Times Square	This hotel is very nice
3,2269,Feb 1 2008 	Nicest Place I've Ever Stayed	What a place! I'm rarely 'over impressed' with a hotel
1,2274,Oct 11 2009	Nanjing Hotel	Very convienent location. Nothing flash but clean and had everything you needed. I wouldn't bother with the breakfast.
2,2274,"Oct 7 2009 	Happy Nanjing!	What an easy and pleasant introduction to Shanghai! For starters, this hotel is SIMPLE to get to from the airport - take the Maglev Express train to the terminus, transfer to the Metro Line 2, 6 stops to Nanjing Road EAST, out exit 1, turn right, walk less than 1 minute and voila! Nanjing Hotel. (The express train costs 50 and the metro ride costs 6 and could not be easier to navigate.)For 3 nights the location was ideal, central to everything. If you are feeling ambitious, at 7am you can walk up Nanjing Road to the People's Square and see all the morning buzz of exercisers and dancers. What a treat! The hotel itself has a quaint charm to it, I love this type of place! Like the reviewer below I was also on the 8th floor, in 801 which is a corner room, also at the end of the corridor, about TWICE as big as other rooms in the hotel, and 2 windows for a nice airy and breezy draft. I only mention that because, effective October 7, the hotel has dismantled its AC for the winter season. Great for the environment, not so great if you like a bit of air in your quarters. :) Problem solved, just ask (nicely) for a fan for the room,As for all the commentary regarding the front desk staff, I live in Asia and found the staff to be patient, accommodating, and helpful. ALL OF THEM. From the moment I walked in the hotel there was an issue with my Expedia booking that they quickly resolved. I was given a choice of rooms. I was provided a fan for my room, travel advice, restaurant advice, shopping advice, and even a hair dryer on request! I think if as a guest in China you take your time and communicate slowly you in your language, you will be met with a courteous and helpful response. As for the bedding, some reviewers complained and yes the bed IS firm but I LOVE it!! (I'd sleep on the floor if I could, hello tatami mat and futon!) If noise is an issue you'll definitely want to be on the back side of the hotel although I was on the front side and the noise completely dies down by evening. I am generally a light-ish sleeper and had no problem. Actually I thought the room and corridor were super quiet (not even sure there were any other guests during my stay- it was THAT quiet) In room broadband internet is available for .10 a mn or 20 a day, fairly reliable altho did time-out every couple of hours and the government has a ban on F@cebook, Tw1tter and Pic@sa currently in place, fyi. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. Also, I highly recommend the sichuan restaurant (told to me by the Front Desk staff hehe) around the corner (try the chicken with peanuts YUMMMM, 28!) and also the Brick Coffee takeaway stand for a delicious Iced Pearl or Milk Tea Coffee (6 and 10 respectively). See photos attached. :)"
3,2274,"Oct 6 2009 	a great find	having hunted through trip advisor for shanghai hotels i went for the Nanjing.The location really is great- 50 metres from shanghai's super shopping street, 70 metres from the Nanjing rd East metro station and right opposite 3 or 4 really good cheap restaurantsif you're concerned about any road noise at night, ask for a room whose number ends between 10 and 17.BTW a few people have said the front desk people are rude-i didn't find that- they were a bit cold but hey, how long do you want to spend at the front desk when you're in shanghai"
4,2274,Oct 4 2009	Good location 50 m to pedestrian street metro 	My 8 night stay was especially pleasant in corner room 820 at the end of the corridor with no passing guests. The wide single beds were very comfortable. Didn't open the windows because it was hot &amp; steamy outside &amp; of course there's noise from the car &amp; motor bike horns. The step up into the bathroom was most interesting &amp; sometimes the shower took time to warm up but worth the wait to be refreshed. Didn't think the buffet breakfast for Yuan 30 worth the money (lots of food choices outside on the stalls &amp; in cafes). The restaurant menu is adequate. Room cleaning was good. Post box outside hotel &amp; PO a few blocks away has a philatelic counter. The police station is a few doors from hotel so lots of men in uniform ! English language channel is CCTV9. Walk the back streets &amp; see a very different world from the one on Nanjing Lu. Get up early to see the tai chi &amp; badminton &amp; people watch.
5,2274,"Oct 3 2009	Extremely Rude Front Desk Staff	The previous reviewers are correct. The hotel is in a great location, right next to the pedestrian mall. The carpet is dirty, the bedding was questionnable, the bathroom is dimly lit, has a strange step up, had lots of mold and half of the showers were cold.The windows are really thin, and the noise is unreal - if you are a light sleeper, do not stay here! The worst part of this hotel is the unbelieveably rude front desk staff.When we asked for directions to a local coffee spot (Starbucks) they pretended to notunderstand. When my white son spoke Mandarin to them (he is currently attending a University in China and met us for the trip), they refused to listen to him. Finally, one ofthe rudies said to go buy a map in the gift shop...they didn't have one map at the front desk! I will never stay here again, or recommend this hotel. There are other places that are just as handy with nice, helpful, staff!"
6,2274,"Oct 3 2009	basic hotel clean good location	People at reception speak english, better than in other places i stayed.Shower has little water pressure.Nothing else to say. Basic.Super location, as good as on nanjing road. Walking distance from the Bund or the People's Square."
7,2274,"Sep 23 2009 	Do they hate their job that much?	State of carpet and hardness of bed was no different to any other hotel we stayed in, in China , BUT the impression you get is that the staff absolutely hate their job and absolutely hate customers!! One big advantage is it's location - close to metro which is great. Close to The Bund - but that's a mess at the moment and will be for some weeks yet I would expect. Great street stalls for breakfast etc - go out door, turn right and both the next street and second street over have plenty of street stalls. Yum."
8,2274,"Sep 12 2009 	great value convenient location	For the rate we got we did not expect the Hilton, which we did not get of course. But we got an absolutely fine room, which was clean and well looked after in a hotel with a great location near the shopping street in walking distance from the Bund (which is of course currently a big construction venue for the Expo 2010) and only a few meters away from the metro station. Did not try the food there as our rate did not incl. any breakfast. Lots of small Chinese restaurants in that street though. Overall a great value for money deal and a completely satisfied stay. Service attitude at the reception was very different, depending from which staff was catering you. One was great, two others not. But we had no probs at all. Would definitely return."
9,2274,"Aug 30 2009 	Unbelieveable value and location	I swapped to this hotel from my hostel further from the centre. I couldn't believe that such an affordable hotel could be right in the centre of the action. It was great to wander along Nanjing Donglu at night, and then just fall into bed. It's especially good for solo travellers like me, who don't really want to be walking a long way to get back to their accommodation at night.The room was fine...clean and comfortable. Some of the staff were a bit surly, but for 300Y a night, this place was fantastic."
10,2274,"Jul 23 2009 	Decent Hotel Great Location	I will just agree with what previous posters said. The hotel is fine - clean enough, standard REALLY hard bed, decent size room. The location is EXCELLENT making it the perfect place to stay when we only had one night to do some sightseeing.The only negative thing I found was that the lighting in the bathroom was terrible and they didn't have any maps of Shanghai available to us."
11,2274,"Jul 16 2009	Great Hotel : )	One of the best aspects of this hotel is its location, right on NanJing road and with easy access to the underground station and the 'newer' parts of Shanghai. The hotel itself was very nice, big, clean rooms. One thing that was slightly strange is that when we were standing in the bathrooms in the rooms everyone felt dizzy!! (we were a big group and nearly everyone mentioned it!!) maybe it was just us. The staff we also very polite and helpful."
12,2274,Jul 6 2009 	Good location and price. Bad hotel	The price is good for the location. The room is not too clean and small. I won't stay there again.
13,2274,"Jul 5 2009 	Best hotel in Shanghai by location and price range!	As other reviewers say, it is truly right off on Nanjing Lu. This is nice considering that this is a tourist hub. The subway stop is also at the corner which makes for a quick route to the MagLev train (to Pudong airport).There is a c-store across the street which I believe is 24 hours which is handy for snacks and water. If you're looking for a nice Americanized breakfast and free wifi, walk up Nanjing Lu toward People Square and stop in at the Costa's. I don't know if Nanjing Hotel had internet because I only had my iPhone with me.The rooms are nice. Booked on ctrip.com for around $40 - $45 a night. They are clean and comfortable. No complaints, except that the shower head's spray was a bit strong (normally a good thing, but there was no other setting). Also, my tub clogged up a bit so I would stand in water while I showered. A minor thing for me, I didn't bother to complain. The beds are standard hardness but China standards. So if you are used to that or know what that means you won't be surprised. If you're not used to it, you'll probably need to adjust to the firmness, unless you're staying at higher priced hotels.Note that the windows do open and the air conditioning works nicely. The rooms on the front side of the building have a balcony which is a treat.The TV only has Chinese channels -- but we were not there to watch TV. Our unit also had a fridge with mini-bar items, but we kept our waters and stuff in there. We also had a safe in the room that was opened by our key card. The room also come with a hot water maker and complimentary tea.The staff is helpful and nice and speak good english. The breakfast spread at the restaurant was only okay. I did not go back as there are many options in the area.Safety: There is some kind of police station or bureau next door to Nanjing Hotel. And though the area didn't feel seedy (being right off Nanjing Lu), it never hurts to see that.One last thing about this hotel. When you walk into the room you get a nice clean smell. None of that musty old hotel funk. For me, that is the moment of truth when entering a new room. Nanjing passed the smell test on the 2 different rooms I stayed in. If my budget is same, I definitely would stay here again. Hope these details help!"
14,2274,"Jun 3 2009	Great location!	Stayed in this hotel as part of a GAP tour and loved the location. Literally a 30 second walk to Nanjing Road and even walking distance to the Bund and People's Square. Also, very close to the subway. Plenty of restaurants in the area (Western and Chinese) and lots of corner stores to buy things like water and snacks (there is also a fridge also in the room to use). The hotel seems pretty old but still fairly clean with friendly English speaking staff. Balcony was also a pleasant surprise and it was nice to lean over the balcony and take in all the sights, sounds and smells of the busy street below. I highly enjoyed my stay!!"
15,2274,"Mar 18 2009	One of the best locations ever	I LOVED this hotel! It was everything you needed with a 30 second walk to Nanjing Road. I don't think you could get a better location. It was a relatively short walk to the Bund and is walkable to the Yuyuen Gardens and Bazaar.It was roomy and comfortable and had been completely renovated, although I did change rooms mid-stay and inherited a bed which made concrete seem cosy, but otherwise it was great! The first bed was good, the second will remain burned in my memory forever.There are hawkers outside who try to entice you into bad restaurants there, but just ignore them and find a quality restaurant of 90 which can be as little as 30 metres past these people. Also watch out for mad motorbike riders as you step out the front door. They stop for NO ONE!The supermarket opposite is cheap as chips and is good for getting change for the train which is 1/2 block away.The English translations all over the hotel are hillarious particularly in the lifts - I'm not sure who wrote them but make sense they did not :)"
16,2274,"Mar 5 2009 	Excellent location great value very satisfied	This hotel is great, the rooms are very clean and comfortable with lots of space, a TV, internet access (with cable), fridge, closet, safe box, and desk. The location could'nt be better, 1 block away from the famous Nanjing Rd. Subway station is 1 block away, very near. There is also a wide selection of restaurants and shops in the area. Would definitely stay in this hotel again."
17,2274,"Dec 26 2008 	Decent Experience	The hotel is in a great location right off of Nanjing Road. It is convenient to get to most of the major sights in Shanghai. The subway stop is less than a minute walk from the hotel. The price of the hotel is also great for the location, but there are some things to mention:Our room 406 had a pretty bad stench that filled up the entire room from one of the restaurants across the street. We informed the staff but unfortunately they said all other rooms were booked. They were well aware of the stench and actually said room 406 was the worst room in the hotel as far as the smell. Upon checkout we mentioned this to the staff again and while they knew about the experience the manager wasn't in and wouldn't be in until the following day and there was nothing they could do about it.Other than the stench, the service was average and the hotel is not a bad one. There are some other hotels right in the area (actually right on Nanjing Road about 2 minutes west of the hotel on the north side that has much cheaper rates (about $5-$10 cheaper) that are available for a cheaper price and same location. All in all it wasn't a bad experience, because of the great price and great location.Not sure I would recommend the place, but if your looking not to spend much money and be central to everything and aren't too concerned about things like &quot;smell&quot;, etc then this may be a good find."
18,2274,"Nov 4 2008	Great Location	I was looking for a hotel close to Nanjing Road and other amentities without having to pay a fortune. I found the Nanjing Hotel at 200 Shanxi Road. It is one of the Jin Jiang group. I read some reviews and the most often read statement was about &quot;hard beds.&quot; My 18 year old granddaughter thought it the most comfortable bed she had slept on and I agreed, having the best sleeps I have had for a long time. The room was large enough for comfort, very clean and was quiet and we could open the window rather to put up with the noise of an AC going all night. There was hot water at all times, both day and night. Breakfast was Chinese but eggs were available and plenty of toast and what goes with it. There were about four restaurants in the road opposite the hotel, plus a small super market and about one minute's walk took us to busy Nanjing Road with all its shops and restaurants. The staff were all friendly and the majority of them spoke English. All this for 3 nights for about $56 per night for a double! Not bad value!!"
19,2274,"Oct 24 2008	Location!!!	Location is perfect. Only few steps to Nanjing road and metrostation. The room was quite small and the bathroom smelly. There was a fridge, safety box, TV with 70 channels (only one english) and a balcony in the superior room. Average hotel with very reasonable price."
20,2274,"Oct 13 2008	A small Oasis of Calm!	This was the 1st hotel we stopped in during a small group travel holiday. I was amazed by how many people they had working behind the small reception desk, but I wouldn't say that any of them, whilst not rude, were particularly friendly and welcoming! The rooms were clean, the linen fresh, the bathroom ok, all the important things that don't turn your trip into memorable for all the wrong reasons! The location was great, walking distance to lots of great places with restaurants galore on the doorstep. The hotel must have been peaceful because stepping outside the hotel felt like a constant game of 'chicken'! (Beware the cars, bikes and motorbikes careering up and down the road!)"
21,2274,"Sep 24 2008 	Location location location.	I stayed at the Nanjing Hotel twice on my short-stay in China, mostly because of the great location. Subway's just around the corner as well as famous East Nanjing Rd. There's a small Supermarket across the street and a couple of restaurants, as well as fruit and vegetable stands down the road (South Shanxi Rd.)Besides that, rooms aren't too spacious, but okay for a city trip. Both bathrooms I had, were way too small and kind of smelly. But the reception staff were very helpful and friendly. So, service and location are great, the rooms are good for sleeping, but nothing more."
22,2274,"Aug 22 2008 	Great hotel for location and price	The Nanjing was the 1st hotel on my trip across Asia, from Shanghai to Bombay. This turned out to be the best hotel on mytrip. Great location, around the corner from the subway station, ona main pedestrian-only street, (Nanjing Donglu). They had a fastInternet connection for a good price. The bathroom must havebeen a recent remod, and was newer and cleaner than many I'veseen in the U.S. I did try the hotel restaurant once, and it was mediocre. There are fine places to eat next door and across thestreet. I tend to buy water from local vendors, then store it in the mini-fridge."
23,2274,"Aug 8 2008 	Great option in the heart of Shanghai	An aged hotel, probably a luxurious one for business men several years ago. Today, a great hotel for budget tourism.You could see the TV tower and the new SWFC tower from the room window, and other skyscrapers. The room and service are all right. The breakfast is also OK, but bear in mind it's chinese breakfast !It's located close to Nanjing Road, the main commercial street in Shanghai. Besides, you could reach the Nanjing East Road metro station in about 3 minutes !! If you just see a picture of the hotel building and the street at which it's located, you won't be able to imagine all that, becasuse they are old and a little dirty, but the location is great !"
24,2274,"Jul 18 2008	Good budget hotel in great location	An ok little budget hotel in a great location. Situated just off the main shopping street, 10 mins from The Bund one way and 10mins from the People's Park the other.Rooms were basic and clean if not a little small.Staff were helpful and spoke EnglishSubway station just round the corner."
25,2274,"Jul 18 2008 	For those who like a city atmosphere	Our room was on level 4 but we could hear the noise from the streets quite loudly. The beds were quite firm.The hotel is a few steps away from the Nanjing Road Shopping Mall (part of the road where no cars are allowed), a walking distance to the Bund (which is very crowded at night but surrounded by beautiful lights from the buildings), the Yan'an Rd East tunnel, the pier, and the Silk King (where we got our silk dresses made). It is a short taxi ride to Old Shanghai (which I prefer to be). The service is average and the front desk people understand/ speak little English (it was difficult to find out any information about nearby tourist places)."
26,2274,"Jul 5 2008 	More than expected!	I stayed 11 nights in this hotel. To be honest my room was delux room, it was quite big, with good bathroom, fridge, safebox and a good air conditioner.The location is fantastic, very close to pedestrian area in east nanjing road and very close to metro station line 2. Just 10 to 15 minutes walk to the Bund area and even less to people's square.The stuff speaks english, but the breakfast is raelly not worth it.I recommend not to eat there, you will find lots of restaurants around.Inside the hotel is much better than how it looks from outside.I think the price is not very cheap not very expensive! If you look for a budget hotel with some standards, here is the place to be.However, there are quite a few hotels in this area with the same condition.In my opinion west nanjing road may be a better place for those who look for foreign bars and clubs and more fancy stores.Have a pleasant stay!Shahab"
27,2274,"Apr 5 2008	Good budget hotel	We stayed in the Nanjing Hotel last month. It is a good, basic budget hotel, just a few steps from Nanjing Lu. I picked this hotel because it was within walking distance to things we wanted to see, but then we never did any walking. Took taxis everywhere. Due to congestion in front of the hotel, taxi drivers may drop you off the block before. Some taxi drivers had difficulty finding the place, so be sure to take a map of its location with you.Hotel was very clean, and the front desk staff spoke very good English. Breakfast is 30 yuan (approx $5.10US), and changes many items daily. Compared to what we pay in the US for breakfast, it was very good value, but you need to like to eat vegetables for breakfast. Several times we ate food from nearby street vendors, and had breakfasts for 3rmb. We hated Shanghai (much prefer Beijing), but if we ever go back, we would stay there again."
28,2274,"Jan 7 2008 	Good location	The best thing is the location. Otherwise it is a very basic hotel with furniture from the 80s. Some staff members speak English, but not all. A bit noisy, remember your earplugs."
29,2274,"Nov 3 2007 	Good location and price	Stayed here for 3 nights because we needed a cheap place - we were saving for a more expensive hotel for the end of our holiday. But we were surprised how large the room actually was for the price, and its great location right in the middle of the Nanjing Road. It was a superior twin room, but only cost a few pounds more than the standard one. The room had two single beds, two chairs, small and large table, good lighting, TV (only Chinese stations), and tea making facilities. The safe didn't work though. We had the room at the end of the floor (no.435) , with a balcony looking down on the cross roads below. It was noisy outside until about 1am, but then silent. Except one night when the builders doing up the shop opposite decided to do a bit of hammering at 3am. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was ok. The shower worked well and the towels were small but sufficient. For the price of the room it was a good hotel and we would definitely go back there."
30,2274,"Mar 27 2007	Nanjing Hotel good for me.	The Nanjing Hotel is an average hotel. The best thing going for it is that it is located less than a city block from the Nanjing Road and a short distance from the Metro. There are several restaurants located in the area and a convenience store located across the street. The rooms are clean and some of the bathrooms have been remodeled. The west side of the hotel has balcony access for the rooms, but it is also the noisiest side of the hotel with all of the traffic on that side. The staff is helpful and can speak English. In all, I would recommend the hotel for any traveler that is on a budget that needs a quiet and clean place to sleep at."
31,2274,"Aug 11 2006 	Okay hotel in good location	We stayed at the Nanjing Hotel from July 21 to 23 as part of a small tour group.This hotel is a very basic one. No hair dryer, no alarm clock, and no safe. But the room was a good size, and was very clean.The location is the best point about this hotel as it is just a few steps away from the central portion of the pedestrian-only zone of Nanjing Road, the major tourist shopping road. It's also near a metro station, which made it easy to get to the Maglev station to go to the Pudong Airport. One note to make is that the glass is single-paned, so it's quite easy to hear the noise outside. I would recommend bringing some ear plugs for a more peaceful sleep.Overall, I would recommend this hotel for budget-conscious travellers who want a good, clean place to stay."
32,2274,"Jun 8 2006	Nanjing Hotel can't be beaten for location or value	After originally booking just 2 nights at the Nanjing Hotel, we immediately booked another 4 nights as soon as we saw the room as we could see it had everything we wanted for our week in Shanghai and for just 350RMB a night (internet booking), it suited our budgetOur room was a B class (better than A class) with a large bed and the softest matress we have ever had in our 18 months living and working in China. The room was on a corner and very quiet, was very clean, no stains on the carpet, the shower and bathroom was perfect and there was a bar fridge as well as tea making facilities with green tea bags.The Aircon was good and didn't cause a draft but the best thing was the room had windows you can open and good lighting thanks to a down light over the bed, a standard lamp and a desk lamp as well as other ceiling lights. Three occasional chairs, a coffe table, good size wardrobe and bedside tables with drawers made the room seem more like a suite. The TV was modern and large with about 30 channels (although only CCTV9 is in English).We asked for and got a hair dryer, and one night after having left our window open, we had a mosquito but a call to reception got us a mossie zapper.The staff spoke very good English, but the travel agency desk, like most in China, couldn't do much for us.We didn't bother eating in the restuarant (we have never eaten in hotels as its always more fun and cheaper to eat outside) and the little lane outside had about a dozen places to choose from and we had breakfast each day one block down the lane where all the locals would eat on their way to work. As well there are several little convenience stores to grab some beer and chips as well as some good fruit shops all within that same part of the lane.We found lots of local eateries in the small streets that run off Nanjing Lu. Those resturants on Nanjing Lu were very expensive but where the locals eat off the mall are very good value.The location had to be the best part. Just thirty paces off Nanjing Lu which is the main pedestrian shopping mall, with a Metro stop on the corner, a 5 minute walk to the Bund and about the same to Peoples Square in the other direction.We noticed that Intrepid Tours puts its tour groups up at the Nanjing Hotel and its easy to see why."
33,2274,Mar 28 2006	Very central.	A nice hotel in the heart of Shanghai. Close to subway and close to the Bund. Nice and clean rooms with a good city view. Reasonable priced.
34,2274,"Jan 26 2006	Great location	Clean, comfortable, large rooms with english speaking staff just off Nanjing Road, 5 mins to Bund. Underground train just around the corner. Excellent local restaurants opposite the hotel. Didn't eat in the hotel but was told it was v. ordinary. Turn right out of hotel and head 1 block to find small supermarket, 1 more block and you'll find good, cheap laundry. Also great breakfast snacks in this area. No hairdryer in the room but one available in reception if you can get it. Recommend taking your own."
35,2274,"Oct 24 2005	Great location	This is a nice hotel in a great location, just next to Nanjing Rd and only 10minutes walk to The Bund. Although not 5 star it is very clean with friendlyEnglish speaking staff. I would recommend this for anyone and it is a good price also."

1,2277,Nov 24 2009 	excellent hotel	the room are very well equiped and very clean ; the decoration is nice and the bed is very confortoable. This is really a top hotel and the area is nice for small shops and restaurant where you can eat typical chinese food. the hotel is nevertheless far from the city center but with cab this is not too much of a problem. Breakfast buffet is amazing and provide a great choice of excellent products
2,2277,Nov 5 2009 	Modern Hotel excellent value.	Couldn't fault the Novotel Atlantis. A very modern hotel with excellent amenities and friendly helpful staff.The rooms were very spacious well kept and clean.The hotel is within walking distance of the train station. I would highly recommend this hotel and would stay there again if visiting Shanghai again in the future.
3,2277,"Sep 29 2009 	Good hotel let down by poor lighting in bathroom	Stayed here 1 night on the 37th floor. Big flat screen TV but no BBC (is it coincidence that it is a French hotel chain!)  no Sleep facility. Separate purpose-built spacious shower and bath. Very poor lighting in bathroom, particularly in front of mirror over sink. Not 5 star, but certainly 4 star.Revolving restaurant on 50th floor  excellent views over Shanghai  where had a seafood buffet. Part of hotel seemed to be closed  descended from lift and found ourselves in the deserted part with two bemused security guards looking at us. They soon gestured us out of the building and into the main street where, after 10-20 metre walk, we were soon back in the main hotel. Glorious view over Shanghai from hotel room. Despite being so high up, lifts were very quick.About 40 minutes from the Pudong international airport (150 yuan by taxi)."
4,2277,Sep 26 2009 	Very nice hotel.	We stayed at this hotel for 11 nights. we had very nice and big room. there is a free internet in all rooms in this hotel. rooms were cleaned every day. the hotel has a nice swimming pool with a view to the city. Also there are some good restaurants.You can catch a taxi to go to the city center. Or use a metro which is 4 minutes walk from the hotel.
5,2277,"Jul 29 2009 	Overall a very good hotel	I stayed here for 2 nights before heading back to Canada from a 4 week trip of China &amp; Malaysia. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect but what I found exceeded my expectations. We arrived on the red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur and much to our surprise, we were able to check in right away (9am). Also, we were given free internet access (which was not included in the price) &amp; late checkout without any hassles. The hotel lobby was nice and spacious.I must say, the service was impeccable. Housekeeping was already in our room before we arrived to set up the rollaway bed and provided lots of extra anemities without being asked. We got a corner room which was more spacious and even with an extra bed, there was lots of room for our suitcases. The only downside is the location. It's in the business district of Pudong and not even close to a subway station. The nearest one was at least a 15 min walk away which seems like an eternity when it's over 40 degrees outside. You definately need to take a cab to get anywhere. Luckily there was a Starbucks next door which was handy.In all, I was very satisifed with this hotel and would stay here again."
6,2277,Jun 16 2009 	Basic business hotel	very basic business hotel. decent clean rooms. in the heart if pudong. 10 min away from thr maglev to shanghai airport. reasonably priced. starbucks in the adjoining lobby..
7,2277,"Jun 6 2009 	Very good hotel	Been at that hotel for 4 days. Hotel's allure is great. The restaurants are interesting and serve good choices and tasty cuisine. Service is quick and with a smile. Location is not an issue. From Pudong airport, taking high speed train + taxi = 30 minutes max. This way, you avoid the cranky taxis. Internet in the room works well."
8,2277,"Feb 27 2009 	Nice modern unpretentious hotel	I liked it a lot. Modern, efficient hotel with good health club facilities. Well located for Pudong business area. I am becoming a fan of this brand. Nice looking restaurants on site."
9,2277,Feb 15 2009 	Novotel Atlantis Shanghai	I stayed at the Novotel Atlantis for four days and overall the hotel is OK. Is far away from the Pudong Airport but its relatively close to Puxi and the Pudong city centre. The hotel is actually close to quite a few food places and you need to be adventurous and walk around the city and check out the places to eat. The hotel staff are ok. Some spoke good english but some staff in concierge lacked a bit in their English. If you need to go to Puxi I would suggest catching a cab as its relatively cheap. Taxi from airport to the hotel i about 125Yuan.
10,2277,"Feb 4 2009 	Good choice for Business travellers	My company liked to put me and my colleagues here in this hotel because it's reasonably priced and it's close to our office. Their suite is fairly big with a living room and separate bedroom.The only knock on this hotel is definitely location. It's not within walking distance from the public transportation routes including subway. I recalled one occasion where we went out for dinner one night, it started to snow heavily and we couldn't find a taxi to take us back to the hotel. At the end, we called the hotel and the conciege staff was kind enough to send a taxi over to bring us back. Of course we were already frozen to death having waited on the cold street for almost an hour."
11,2277,"Jan 23 2009 	Not bad	Not the cheapest stay, but it doesn't look cheap. Most of the staff were nice but not easy to communicate with. You have to speak simply and slowly. We didn't have a problem with the non-smoking room smelling of cigatette smoke, but 2 other guests told us they did. As well as some guests smoking in non-smoking areas, we saw several who didn't seem to have any respect for the hotel or other guests, even like spitting and discarding half-eaten candy on the floor. I wonder how the hotel will look in a few years if guests are allowed to not follow rules like that?"
12,2277,"Dec 21 2008 	If only distant wasnt the factor	Upon reading the previous reviews, i was quite worried. Most of the negative reviews are that it is quite far from the actions. I am visiting shanghai for 9 nights and stayed in Novotel Atlantis for 3 of it. I didnt really care whether the hotel will be far or not because I have another 6 nights in Westin right in the centre of town.Let me tell you this. It is not as far as i would have imagined from reading the reviews.I got a perfect room on the 37th floor, a corner room. Absolutely perfect view of the Shanghai Pudong Skyline (from the back) on one side and the commercial ports on the other.The checkin was rather annoying, considering i have already given them a call that i will be arriving at about 1am. That didnt bother me much though.The room was beautiful, spacious (maybe its the corner room) and as i said, with a beautiful view.Room service food was of good quality. House keeping really leaves you alone with the &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign on, which is what look for in any hotel.On my second day, I went up to the Art50 Restaurant on the top floor, which is a revolving restaurant. The food was ok, a seafood buffet, i am not a big fan of seafood, and i dont know why i go for it.But i think to seafood lovers it might be great, I'll leave that for you people to comment.At the dinner, the Director of Food and Bev noticed that i was having dinner alone (I was travelling alone), he came by to greet me. Talked to him for a while and i must say he is a very understanding and professional in hospitality issues.Oh, and he ordered a good pint of beer for me, on the house, which is always welcoming to any Aussie.Upon my departure day, i went down for breakfast at 2nd Deck Cafe. The Breakfast were nice, they cook egg on the spot for you. I reckon the bread could be better, it can get rock hard.Staff at the breakfast service were rather less friendly, and rarely smile, but that didnt really bother me. One good thing, they were very quick to remove your used plates, which is a real plus.Check out were quick and pleasant. The bellboy was quick to get to the room, and the Reception staff were very quick in processing. Further more, He did make sure that i quoted the correct A-Club Membership number.Overall, it was a pleasant stay. If you werent looking for a hotel right in the heart of town, then Novotel could be the hotel of choice. I would have to agree with most previous reviews about the hotel being abit out of the way, but fortunately for me, as i said, it wasn't part of the factor to consider for this stay. I would love to come back to this hotel again. Recommended for service."
13,2277,"Nov 10 2008 	What A Disaster	The other reviews point out this hotels unfavourable location. It is removed from shops, restaurants and anything that would give a visitor thr feeling of being in Shanghai. The rooms a clean and well maintained but the staff have limited English for foreign visitors. It is a hotel without a sense of place. I did not try their premier restaurant on the top floor but hosted business guests to the rather expensive 118 yuan buffet on the second floor and was left embarrased by the poor quality of the food and the confussed selection. Another review warned about the in-room massage in which &quot;extras&quot; are offered - be warned - not a good look for Accor the operator. Another warning; I booked on the Accor website and when there was a problem the Assist Front Office Mgr produced a print-out with my full credit card number, my name and the security three digit code from the back of the card - a security nightmare. There are plenty of better alternatives that will give visitor a sense of the excitement that is Shanghai."
14,2277,"Sep 16 2008 	Good mid-range hotel	This is a nice hotel with friendly staff. The room was fine with cable tv, fridge and the bottled water came in handy (although it was cheap to buy in the city as well). The hotel is a bit out of the tourist area, with the walk to the river taking about 40 minutes. However, pudong dadao runs outside the hotel and is a major rd so you can easily get a bus, or a taxi from the hotel, which are very cheap. A taxi to nanjing donglu (major shopping area over the river) costs about 25RMB which is very cheap in western money. Even the taxi from the airport was only the equivalent of $20 for a 1 hour ride. However, the taxi drivers go fast and drive to their own rules so buckle up! Also, there is a metro station 1 block away and the trains are great in Shanghai (although crowded). The breakfast is standard western/asian hot buffett and Olive's restaurant was good (and cheap). Make sure you learn some basic Chinese before you come or ask the staff to write down the hotel name in Chinese to give to taxi drivers. I found very few people (and hardly any taxi drivers) spoke English. The people in Shanghai are however very friendly and accommodation and you can get along fine with a smile and laugh."
15,2277,May 30 2008	Hotel assessment	I stayed for a week at the Novotel Atlantis in Pudong. The location is more suited to business people than tourists. However the rate was much cheaper (around $50/night cheaper) than for hotels in the city centre (eg the Bund). A taxi to the Bund costs about 20 yuan ($3). So for a 10 minute trip it was a reasonable trade off. A subway station is one block away for even cheaper transport. The hotel room was as expected for 4 star. Restaurants in the hotel were disappointing but typical for Shanghai. (The Hyatt's highly rated restaurant cost me $300 for 2 and was much inferior to Hong Kong standards.) The standard of food hygiene at Novotel appeared good however. The breakfast buffet was quite good. The hotel gives you a litre of bottled water every day which is essential in Shanghai. Travel advice from the concierge or other staff was really unavailable due to their extemely limited English ability. Not even brochures were available. Most other guests were Europeans so English may not be in demand much. Conclusion: would stay there again but with lower expectations.
16,2277,"Jan 29 2008	I suspect you can find better in Shanghai	The rooms are nice enough but the hotel is not the best run Novotel in Asia. You might want to avoid the hotel restaurants as they are pretty hopeless. The independent Chinese restaurant just outside the main entrance to the left is vastly superior and is an impressive destination. After some 10 days of meetings and travellng I thought a nice massage, steam and sauna might be in order. Unfortunately the massage girl got a bit upset when I declined the 'Special Massage'. Very disappointing to end up in this scenario in a major brand hotel. If this is not your thing then best avoided.The Sofitel Pudong was classier and not very much more expensive, I will stay there in future."
17,2277,"Sep 17 2007 	Nice hotel in shanghai	We stayed at this hotel on (23 &amp; 24 August) and booked the hotel through the hotel website. The down side to this hotel is that it is quite far away from downtown Shanghai and that there is not much to see or do near the hotel, there is a subway about 15 minutes walk away or you need to use taxis.On the positive side the hotel is very clean, with very friendly and knowledgeable staff who speak good english. The rooms are modern and of a very high standard, the rooms higher up have great views of the river. the hotel has a pool and plenty of restaurants and bars. special mention for the very helpful concierge staff.overall very good hotel and good value for money, pity about the distance from downtown."
18,2277,"Aug 24 2007	A good Hotel in Pudong	I stayed in this Hotel several times during last year and my general opinion is very positive....nice modern rooms with great view if they are on high floors, good restaurants, and very nice bar on the 50th floor (turning around slowly and giving excellent view to Shanghai by night...No serious problems except that is in Pudong area and not so close to the centre of Shanghai (need taxi)"
19,2277,"Apr 17 2007 	Nice comfortable hotel but inconvenient uninteresting location.	I stay at this hotel whenever my company sends me to Shanghai for business. It is certainly a good hotel for business especially if youre doing business in the Pudong area. However, I would not recommend this for tourists simply because it is far or at least inconvenient to get to the central and more interesting neighborhoods of the city, like the Bund or Nanjing Road. Youll have to take a taxi or subway to get anywhere. Sometimes, its hard to get a taxi during rush hour or when its raining! Besides, theres really nothing interesting within walking distance around the hotels neighborhood, certainly not restaurants, cafes, or shopping. The hotel has a fairly large lounge/bar and a business lounge on the 48th floor. Rooms are spacious, especially the de luxe rooms. They are well-lit, have light colored modern furnishings, very clean, and have ample closet space. Most, if not all rooms have birds-eye views of the city, beautiful especially at night! Beds are firm, almost too firm, pillows are thin, and towels not very plush but they do supply a bathrobe, slippers, and complimentary bottled water. Nice touch with the fresh rose on the pillow at turndown and rose petals floating in the toilet! The hotels gym is not very big but well-equipped. The restaurants are adequate but I would not recommend eating there if you dont have to, not good value for the money and the quality of food is inconsistent at best. But the breakfast buffet is not bad, a good variety of dishes. Overall, the hotel is good value for the money if you dont mind the location being inconveniently away from the city center and attractions."
20,2277,"Feb 21 2007 	Great Hotel	My husband and I and another couple stayed at the Novotel Atlantis the first week of Feb 2007. I did not book the hotel, my friend did, and I was very concerned after reading reviews on this site.We all had excellent experiences. Upon arrival we were upgraded to business class at no extra charge to us. Our rooms were small but well appointed and had everything you could need. The beds were hard, but we ordered an extra duvet and put it under us. The bedding and pillows were very comfortable. The rooms were spotless, and we recieved turn down service every night. We were brought 2 fresh roses every night, and when they do the turn down service, they also tidy the bathroom and put rose petals in the toilet. The rooms have robes, irons, and all the comforts of home plus a few more. The toiletries were exceptional, with nothing left out.The restaurants were great. They were a little expensive, but the quality and selection were great. There was a small deli type restaurant, as well as two casual dining rooms, and the revolving restaurant on the 50th floor. There was also a lounge just off the lobby.Our every wish was catered to promptly and professionaly. I was dreading check out becuase I had read negative things here on this site. I went over the entire bill (6 nights and all meals) with a fine tooth comb and there were absolutely no mistakes. The couple we were travelling with had no problems either.The rooms had complimentary bottled water daily.The staff was very helpful and spoke English very well. The concierge and front end staff were especially helpful in directing taxi drivers for us, and providing us with notes in chinese to give to taxi drivers.It was about 15 min from major shopping, but we didn't mind because we got to see more of the city.I would highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again myself. Everything exceeded my expectations, and believe me, I can be a fussy hotel guest.I almost forgot to mention the fabulous workout facility. It was a fully stocked gym. The change rooms have steam rooms and hot tubs. This was all complimentary. The pool was beautiful with lots of windows to oversee the city.I did find the spa services a little expensive, and did not ingulge. However, I am sure they were par with market value.Do not hesitate to stay here. It is definatley a business/corporate hotel. They know how to treat their guests with all the comforts of home, including western food. Have a great trip!"
21,2277,"Jan 8 2007 	Terrible service remote location never again	We read good reviews of the hotel, and we booked 4 nights in January 2007 through their hotel website. The hotel is far from all attractions of the city. There is absolutely nothing interesting around the hotel (other than a frienly local massage service opposite the entrance). Your best bet is to take a taxi to metro station and then a metro to city centre. You can of course take a taxi to the city, but the traffic is so bad that it would take you close to one hour, and the bets that you will be cheated by taxi driver is more than 50%. The hotel is a highrise building, so nice views especially at night, but rooms are simple, and in our room the heating was not working. However it took us one day and three different engineers to convince them that the heating was not working properly. After that, they changed our room, and the heating was fine, but by then we already got ill. Any service in the hotel is very very pricey and very bad. For example internet access was 4 yuans per minute (240 yuans or 24 euros per hour), and the connection was slow (apparently due to an earthquake in Taiwan). the same connection is 3 yuans PER HOUR in the city, and in 1 yuan per minute (60 yuans per hour) in a 5 star hotel in Shanghai. Also, the hotel double charged the bill when I booked through internet (apparently they had a problem with their VISA machine that day). Explaining the situation was a communication nightmare, as there are noone who speaks good English. Worse is that they think they understand! After hours of battling they agreed to contact the finance department who acknowedged the error, but I am still waiting for the refund. In short, I would never stay in this hotel again, and I cannot recommend it to anyone."
22,2277,"Oct 8 2006 	Great value for your money	we have been 2 nights in october in this hotel and got a corner-room in the 41 th floor. we had a view to the jin mao tower and the bund. the room was very clean and comfortable. we booked over the accor-hotels.com webside and payed approx. 95 US-$ for one night.the staff is very helpful and friendly. the breakfast buffet is excellent, you can find something for europeans/americans or for asians.when you come from pudong airport take the magnetic train and then take a taxi to the hotel, it cost you approx. 3 US-$. when you go to the bund take also a taxi, its about 15 minutes and cost you approx. 2 US-S."
23,2277,"Aug 30 2006 	Had a great stay at the Novotel	This was a typical novotel property. Clean and business like throughout. The rooms were simply and nicely appointed. Some great views from the upper floors including some spectacular views of the Jin Mao Tower - Shaghai's tallest building. The hotel is located in the Pudong district and is about a 20 min taxi ride from the main toruist areas of the The Bund. The good news is that the taxis in shangahi are very relaible and really cheap and you can get them from the front of the hotel. There really isn't much around the area as far as shops or restaurants. Ask the hotel and they will direct you to a couple of large shopping and restaurant complexes about 5 min taxi from the hotel. You might want to try dining at the revolving restaurant at the top of the hotel. I never did so can't comment, but the ride to the top is fun in a stomach churning glass elevator some 70 stories! The hotel had great indoor pool and spa facilities which we used quite a bit as well. Overall a good choice - though not in the heart of the tourist area."
24,2277,"Jan 20 2006 	Not the best but hey its just a Novotel	This hotel is adequate for business travel.The lobby was just ok, a typical 3.5 - 4 star.The location was great for Pudong access, but terrible if your on holidays, 45mins from the French Con.The service was just average. Concierge was bad.If you dont speak Mandarin commuication will be a chore, but not impossible, I speak Mandarin, but tested out the staffs English skill, not to great.The room itself was typical of all novotels.I paid for a sedan transfer to the airport and ended up with a mini bus that was in need of retirement.Look this place didn't blow me away. If you don't have another option by all means stay here. But personally I think its highly overpriced for what it is."
25,2277,"Nov 26 2005	enjoy my stay	Altho' not near to the shopping area and public transport, it is quiet and clean. Stay in deluxe room and asked for the city view. Taxi is still cheap and can get you anywhere."
26,2277,"Aug 25 2005 	I'll stay here again.	Very good value for money. Clean, efficient and quite satisfactory in Pudong - everything one really needs. Seems to be popular with French tourists and unpretentious business travellers (that's me). I'm becoming a Novotel fan... ."
27,2277,Jun 7 2005	great hotel in the pudong	I had a 4 day stay here recently. Rooms were lovely although windows a bit small. The conference facilities were great too. The position of the hotel is in the pudong which means for the markets and the bund you need to catch a taxi but it is very cheap at 2 euros for most rides! Stay and enjoy!

1,2280,"Oct 30 2008 	Loved the location	We were on a textile tour and our US guide had been to China 32 times. So she knew Shanghai. The hotel is being remodeled so get a room facing the street. I had two different rooms on two different occasions and had no problems. Everything was clean and the rooms were huge. I could walk right out of the hotel across the street to People's Park and never felt unsafe. The breakfast buffet was huge. I loved their fried potatoes....and the tomatoes were very fresh. I also ate some of the regional vegetables and meat. I did not drink the coffee as it was very strong. I loved the stay there. I can still hear the street saxaphone player outside the window......I also had some laundry done for a reasonable price. It came back the same day, folded very neatly and ironed better than I could. I would definitely go back."
2,2280,"Feb 5 2008 	Lucky Dip	On my second stay at this hotel I discovered why it gets some OK reviews and some bad reviews. The room I was given this visit was meant to be the same class as the one I had a month before but there was no comparison. The room had bare floors where the carpert was ripped out. I got a tin of insect spray delivered to my room to deal with the cockroach and bed bugs, the shower was broken, the bed was small. After a night wrapped in my own clothes for protection as I slept and extensive 'negotiations' at front desk I got the room I had last time - '502' - they bumped another person who had booked it. Same price but much larger and included carpet and some light.At its best this place is passable. At it's worse it's an experience never to forget. The staff are generally helpful and the 502 cleaner was good but never expect a smile or them to be distracted from their own conversations for your benefit (even if you speak mandarin!) They never say 'xie xie' or 'bu ke qi'. The same company runs Park Hotel which looks much better and is very close - maybe the reject staff end up here."
3,2280,"Jan 19 2008 	Disgusting and dirty do not stay here!	We checked into this hotel in the afternoon and checked out the next day. The hotel is disgusting and dirty. I can tolerate an older style hotel, but dirtiness? No way. It was a huge let down to our holiday. We checked into the lovely 5 star hotel next door. The bathroom was so appalling that I refused to get into the shower. It was mouldy, dingy and reminded of a cheap backpacker hostel."
4,2280,"Jan 17 2008 	Convenient central location	This hotel, just north of People's Park, is in an ideal location for first-time tourists. It is next to the junction of two major subway lines, and just a few blocks from both the Nanjing Road pedestrian mall and the Shanghai Museum. The lobby has the appearance of a former elegance that has faded away. Our rooms were furnished with two twin beds, and large enough so we did not feel cramped for space but small enough that it did not feel luxurious. The furnishings were old, but in good condition. It was warm when we stayed there (about 30C), and the air conditioning was barely adequate. The rooms initially had a slightly musty odor, but that seemed to dissipate. The rooms have ethernet connections to the internet; when we did not find a cable, we bought one for 10RMB (later, we found an ethernet cable in the desk drawer). The buffet breakfast was pretty good, but it cost 66RMB; there were lots of places just outside the hotel where you could get a much cheaper breakfast. For those with an ATM card from Bank of America, there is a China Construction Bank ATM located in the shopping mall on Nanjing Road two doors to the east."
5,2280,"Nov 15 2007 	Good location forget about luxury	Visited Shanghai for the first time with 2 girlfriends. Excellent location, room was clean, good shower but that's about it. No luxury whatsoever, which was fine with us as we were out all day and just needed a place to sleep. Definitely not the place for you if you like to spend a lazy day in. But will not stay here again, prefer a little more luxury next time."
6,2280,"Nov 1 2007	What a DUMP! Avoid this place!!!	Just returned from a small group tour in China and had been suspicious of this hotel having read previous reviews on this website. (Sadly I had no choice since I was with a tour.) The only positive thing to be said about it is the location across from People's Square. The picture on their listing makes the hotel look glamorous with night lighting but don't let that fool you. The lobby looks elegant with it's vintage styling but that's as far as it goes. When we arrived I was given a dark, smoke scented and filthy room facing a dingy building. I immediately complained and was given a slightly &quot;better&quot; room on another floor, meaning that it didn't reek of smoke. I was too tired to move again but upon further inspection discovered old, decrepit scratched furniture with burn marks. Carpets were filthy and stained. Bathroom was grubby: moldy grout and caulking around tub and toilet. Window in bathroom was stained and not sealed. Furthermore there was no safe in either room I was in, although several members of our group had them, and had slighly cleaner brighter rooms than I did. (Most of the group was NOT happy with the accomodations.) Apparently there are a few remodeled rooms facing the street which, though noisy, at least had daylight. I stayed one night and woke up itching from some sort of bites on my head. There was no way I was going to stay in this place one more night, so I left and found a clean, modern and reasonably priced place elsewhere at my own expense. To add insult to injury, I later discovered that the front desk staff was completely useless at trying to locate guests. My husband attempted to call me several times and they said they couldn't find me on their roster. They had no record of my registration, and could not connect me to anyone in our group, in spite of the fact that they required our passports when we arrived. Forget it if there had been an emergency! I agree with the reviewer who mentioned not staying in older hotels in China. We stayed in a few other older hotels in China but they were cleaner and better kept. All the resources seem to be going into new properties in preparation for the 2008 Olympics."
7,2280,"Oct 30 2007 	Great base to explore Shanghai	This hotel is nothing special - but then you're not paying top dollar for a room here. Hotel is well located just over the road from People's Square metro station (which is conveniently linked to Pudong International by a single simple change for the Maglev train at Longyang Road).The rooms were nothing special, but were well turned out and comfortable.The front desk were nothing special either, but were more than capable of translating addresses from English into Chinese for use with taxis.The hotel is not a place to spend oodles of time in. It is more suited as a place simply to sleep at. As such, I highly recommend it as a base for exploring based on its location and price."
8,2280,"Jul 27 2007 	Not worth it	We stayed here for 4 nights in July. The good things first: breakfast was included in our hotel price and it was a decent spread of western and chinese food. The AC (a necessity in the hot summer months in China) worked well in our room. Location was great, across from the Metro and People's Square and right down the street from the flashy pedestrian shopping area and upscale mall. The minuses...I got a creepy feeling everytime I walked in due to the fact that the employees were always staring at us. I saw other westerners staying at this hotel and even after a couple of days after thet got to recognize that we were staying in the hotel, they still stared at us. The rooms are definitely old (marketed as old world European) but there's a difference between old and dirty, this place was both! The carpets were stained in the rooms and there were cracks on the walls and near the sink and shower. The last night we were there there was a constant drip near the mini bar, probably caused by the room above's AC. Given our limited knowledge of Chinese and the employees minimal knowledge of English, it was difficult to tell them that they needed to fix the problem. Overall, there must be a better deal in Shanghai than this place. The overall ambience was not worth spending the money on."
9,2280,"May 27 2007 	Great Location	This hotel is wonderfully located in front of People Square (main museums, metro station), next to the main shopping street and if you like walking, you can do it all the way to the river or the french quater. My room was perfect and quiet. Interenet at the business center was ok.In the restaurant they are not very friendly. You can have your breakfast in the Stabucks only a block away.rates were good value for money and the staff at the front desk was helpful.I would easily go back th this hotel"
10,2280,"Nov 26 2006 	Don't bother possibly the worst hotel in China!	I've stayed in this hotel during my vacation my first time in Shanghai, China last year and it basically ruined my trip. I just had a conversation with a friend last week and she told she just had an exciting and wonderful time in Shanghai the week before and she told me she also stayed at a 2-3 star hotel but a new one! She told me to NEVER stay in a hotel that is not new because the maintence of hotels in China is not the best.... I've then decided that I need to give some guidance to fellow travellers before booking a hotel in Shanghai because it could basically make or break your stay in this city...also NO ONE should experience the horrible nightmare that we were in.I was travelling with my husband's family since they have some family friends in this city and we have decided to stay for a few nights. My sister-in-law booked this hotel thinking I would absolutely adore it since it's supposed to be built early in the century with Renaissance-esque decoration since I do adore anything that has some sort of antiquity to it. When we arrived, we were quite impressive with stone Roman Columns at the front entrance but it ends there...When we walked into the front entrance, the hotel looked like it was not maintained since it was built and the front desk was EXTREMELY slow, it took at least half an hour to check in and there is NO service for anything since we wanted to know if there is any local day tour or local attraction, their reply was always no or don't know....Our room size was decent but I felt like I was back in my dorm room in college with minimal amenities but the feeling is A LOT worst, at least my dorm room was clean. The windows open to a VERY DUSTY wall and we just keep the curtain close at ALL times. Also, the room is not well kept and the carpet looked filthy so we had to walk around in socks the whole time we were there (we threw our socks away at the end of the trip). The bathroom is okay but the crevices between the tiles in the bathtub is black. TV remote control had dirt all around the numbers and we had to use a towel to use it.... Believe me - I DID NOT put any of my clothes away and left them in the luggage at ALL times. I was joking to my husband that I need to go to a local supermarket to get some cleaning supplies and scrub this place clean!Actually, one incident that I will never forget comes when my husband realized he left his wallet behind after about 2 blocks away and we had to go back up to get it and guess what, they had already finished cleaning the room...we were amazed and not surprised given the above condition. Basically - we dreaded going back to the hotel every night and I cannot complain because my in-laws have already felt really bad... I've never felt happier checking out of ANY hotel. I've stayed at MANY hotels since I travelled a lot for business (have stayed from 6 stars to 1 star hotel) but this is one of the worst hotel I've stayed in."
11,2280,"Sep 28 2006 	What a Great Place to Stay!!!	I will certainly stay here next time I go to Shanghai! The location is absolutely awesome, right at the intersection of East and West Nanjing Roads. The hotel staff is helpful, friendly and, while their English is not what you could call &quot;bilingual,&quot; they do their best to be completely responsive to your needs. The hotel itself has all the amenities in a lovely old Italianate style hotel. If they put in new carpeting they could easily upgrade to a 4 star! It was wonderful to have a free internet laptop in my room. I stayed there for 4 days and never used the restaurant because there was too much available outside the hotel in easy walking distance. Everything in my room was clean and in perfect condition. Don't be afraid of the bad review of this hotel. It is above average for the price and you could never beat the location."
12,2280,Dec 12 2005 	Great location and room with a view	My family spent five days at the hotel and found location to be excellent. We paid for a better room facing the front and it was worth the extra. Everything in the room was great including the internet connection to my notebook. my friend had a single room in the back which was quieter than the front but looks into a dirty courtyard with debris. The restaurant standards are average but there is a famous eating street two minutes walk away.This hotel is excellent for location and facet for a reasonable price. It is an old building with slightly worn carpets and decor so don't expect the same shine as the Radisson hotel next door. I will use this hotel again for the location and ambience of people's square. Note that this hotel is inconvenient for handicap or wheelchair.
13,2280,"Nov 8 2005 	Not Even a 3 Star	I was unfortunate enough to stay here because my travel agent could not book me in any where else. This hotel was built in 1928 and at that time it would have been outstanding - but it is no longer. This hotel is in desperate need of a serious make over as everything is tired and worn out. I stayed in two different rooms, a suite and a twin share. In the suite I turned over the bed spread and it had stains that looked to me as though they could be bodily fluids. The beds are hard but that is the case right throughout China. The showers water pressure resembled a hose and that was in both rooms. The rooms are clean overall but the grout in one of the bathrooms was really dirty. The breakfast buffet caters more to eastern tastes but there is a western menu available which consists of coffee, toast and ceral. I stayed away from the milk but I am always sceptical of dairy products in Asia. Coffee and tea facilities in room is Chinese Tea. Cable T.V is HBO and BBC world news and about 50 other Chinese stations. The best things about this hotel is the location but if you want to eat western food go next door to the Radisson."

1,2281,Oct 14 2009 	Lovely hotel and great value	This is a very nice looking new trendy hotel. The service is OK. The rooms are roomy and clean. If you have business in the area this is a great value hotel.The pool is long and narrow - the best I have seen for a Hotel to do laps.
2,2281,"Feb 8 2009 	One of the best business hotels in Shanghai	I travel to Shanghai moderately often on business. The Parkyard is ideally suited to people doing business in the Zhangjiang industrial park (Lenovo, Flextronics, Valeo, and many other international high tech firms). It is a bit off the &quot;beaten path&quot; if you are headed out at night for dinner with clients and colleagues, but the organic restaurant in the train station next door has excellent food and is fine for casual dining (and I'm really picky about Asian cuisine).The hotel is almost new, with a solid 4-5 star level of furnishings and decorations. The layout tends to a cross between German modern and contemporary Chinese serene. Unlike some other expensive Shanghai hotels, staff is generally well trained (except the shoe shine service, which was horrible ... the put lots of polish on the shoes, but then didn't buff it off!). The heath club really is a health club with a nice lap pool, exercise room and quality &quot;real&quot; massage service. Breakfast is very good, if sometimes crowded. The house coffee is not good, use the automatic capuccino machine instead.The only caveats; there are a block of rooms along one side of the hotel that are situated along a very noisy/busy sidewalk (I think it's ChenHui Road). There's a 8' privacy wall, but it doesn't help if you want to sleep in. Always request a room with a window to one of the interior courtyards.Price: I think it's one of the best values in Shanghai, even when you factor in the cost of a taxi to PuDong or PuXi."
3,2281,"Nov 3 2008 	Quite nice just some small little problems...	I stayed in this hotel 3 times since Oct 2007. As the previous poster pointed out, it's a new hotel and is very close the Zhangjiang industrial park where some international companies are located. I stayed there for the same reason.It's also very near to the subway station, about 5 mins' walk, to the right of the hotel.As far as the hotel is concerned, the bell hops are all very polite, helpful and cheerful. Two of them remembered me and when I last stayed - that was quite impressive!!The hotel is a business hotel with only one restaurant which serves breakfast and dinner with a limited menu. The breakfast is good with a great variety. Now dinner is average and pricey so just step out of the hotel and walk to the food and entertainment area next to the hotel (literally next door - subway, starbucks, Chinese restaurants, etc)I like the fact that the lobby is chic, minimalistictic and smells good all the time. The rooms are spacious with the same minimalist style. Internet is free of charge and works very well.The only problem with this hotel is HOUSEKEEPING - for my 1st and 3rd (most recent) stay, I needed to call the housekeeping back to do the clean up again. There was hair, watery stain and patches of sticky stuff on the writing desk this time.The manager was very apologetic and explained that it was because they were running full house, which could be true. I was eventually upgraded to an executive suite because there was no other room available that night. In that room though, the phone didn't work.These small little issues prevent me from giving this hotel a rating of 5. I do look forward to staying at this hotel again because the staff is friendly (except for the staff at breakfast).By the way, if you are coming back to the hotel from Puxi area, make sure that you bring the hotel's address. Most drivers on the other side of the city doesn't know this hotel. Tell them it's next to the subway station. I will post pics later...hope this helps!"
4,2281,"Dec 30 2007 	Great place to stay for ZhangJiang	I booked several nights for a business delegation to Pudong, and this was an ideal hotel for our needs. There was great attention to our every request, and the staff were beyond helpful. The hotel is new, and since it is at the last Subway stop in Pudong, relatively quiet (i.e., no tourists) - which was, again, perfect for our group. As it was located right next door to the Zhangjiang station, our commute to Puxi and other locations was simple and efficient."

6,2281,Apr 17 2009 	Non credo lo consiglierei...
1,2293,Aug 22 2009 	Hotel Agreable	In a nace garden place
2,2293,Jul 15 2009	Superb setting	We enjoyed our four-night stay here in 2008. The park surrounding the hotel is ideal for a before-breakfast or after-dinner stroll. The hotel itself is excellent - try the Chinese restaurant.	
3,2293,May 28 2009 	Great hotel shame about the location	Spent two nights at this hotel during a business trip. If it weren't for the location
4,2293,Feb 19 2009 	mediocre	The location is great for walking in the residential former French Concession
5,2293,Feb 3 2009 	Very nice hotel in the French Concessions	This is a very nice hotel
6,2293,Dec 6 2008 	Good not the best location	This is a newer hotel with very comfortable rooms. I have only had breakfast in the dining areas
7,2293,Sep 19 2008 	All in all a 4 star experience but could improve...	The hotel has great rooms in a nice quiet setting. The restaurants were lacking however and the executive lounge was a smoke fest at night. The hotel had the best workout room I have experienced in Shanghai and yes I have stayed at the Shangri-La :). It is close to Xintiandi and about 20 minutes from the Bund. I will stay there again
8,2293,Sep 6 2008 	A Good Hotel	We stayed at the Radisson Xing Guo in late August . Our family of five includes children aged 15
9,2293,Aug 9 2008	Nice Room and Pleasant Stay	We stayed at the Radisson Shanghai Xing Guo Hotel as part of a group tour package that included visits to Beijing
10,2293,May 23 2008 	A tad far but nice rooms	The hotel is a bit far from the city centre and the main cluster of the big name hotels. Most taxi drivers don't know this hotel so remember the address and preferably the road junction in Mandarin. The main entrance of the hotel is located inside the park/grass area
11,2293,Nov 11 2007 	Great Hotel! Would go back again!!!	We visited Shanghai on business and I was given the responsibility of planning our whole trip. Considering I am not well travelled and knowing that we were going to be in China for two whole weeks
12,2293,Oct 30 2007 	Nice location	This hotel is in a nice quiet location in Shanghai in a rather attractive part of town. The grounds are expansive but they are dotted with buildings and dont really qualify as a 'garden'. The rooms are neat and adequately equipped. The level of service depends upon the member of the staff you draw. I have had service that was really excellent especially in the Li Palace resturant
13,2293,Aug 6 2007 	nice hotel	Very nice hotel
14,2293,Apr 19 2007 	Business stay	Stayed for a business meeting. Rooms are nice - stayed in the &quot;Jr. Suite&quot; with Plaza Club use ( as an executive club
15,2293,Jul 28 2006 	Great hotel in Shanghai	We stayed at this property for 3 nights in July 2006 with our 3 and 5 year old daughters. The bathroom was large and very clean with a huge tub. We had two beds that were very comfortable. The TV got many foreign channels. Here are a couple of points:1) the hotel has a great pool and gym. I got a massage there that was ok
16,2293,Jun 27 2006	A Lovely Boutique Hotel	I did an extensive research and picked Radisson Plaza as our hotel in Shanghai as the 15-acre garden may serve the playground for our young kids. As a matter of fact
17,2293,Jun 11 2006	The Best Hotel	I have stayed in many luxury properties
18,2293,Apr 18 2006	LOVED IT!	We stayed three nights in april. We are so happy we chose this hotel. In the begining we tried to go to the Westin as there was an internet offer and we tought location was better but could not do it because of some problems with the credit car. This hotel is excellent and
