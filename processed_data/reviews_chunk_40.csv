11,924,"Jul 26 2009 	Ok hotel for short stay	The rooms are quite small, but most hotelrooms in London are. We had a problem with the room being a bit cold, no heating. The location is great, close to Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate station. For short stays this hotel is ok, but for longer trips I'd rather pay a bit more and find a hotel with larger rooms."
12,924,"Jul 23 2009 	Satisfied	We stayed in 3 different rooms at 3 different times. The first was large, but stained carpet and torn wallpaper. The second was very pretty and large. The third was fine, but small. People were friendly and breakfast was enough for us. For such a great location and in an old townhouse, this place is fine."
13,924,"Jul 20 2009 	Good location 	Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights after Scandinavian cruise. This is an average hotel that disparately needs renovation. Our room had a good size, was clean and had all the necessary things. What we liked the best about this hotel that there is a Russian restaurant downstairs! Food is great and not expansive. This is a family owned restaurant and the owner and his family are very nice and pleasant! A lot of Russian celebrities visited this place! If you would like to try Russian food this is the perfect place!!! Name of the restaurant is &quot;Erebuni&quot; - www.erebuni.ltd.uk"
14,924,"Jul 14 2009 	Great location and value for money	The location of this hotel is very good and only a 5 minute walk from Paddington station. The street it is situated on is quiet and quite pretty. The rooms are a bit tired looking but they were clean. The staff are friendly and really helpful, they changed our room to one with a bath with no problems. Breakfast was good too. Little venice is about a 15 minute walk away so we took a stroll there on Sunday morning. The Swan pub has live entertainment on Fri, Sat &amp; Sun nights which we throughly enjoyed. I thought for the price we paid this was a great little hotel for a long weekend away and i would defo book it again."
15,924,"Jul 12 2009 	Good no frills accommodation	After being warned of exhorbitant costs of accommodation in London, I was relieved to find the London Guards on Tripadvisor. Arriving at Paddington station, with no idea of its location, I found it within 15 minutes, thanks to helpful people I asked (including one Aussie!) It is in a quiet square, just a few minutes walk from Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, Lancaster Gate and Queensway tube stations, and both Hop-On-Hop-Off bus pick up points. Breakfast is basic but adequate, staff helpful, and will book day tours, etc. My room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Being an older lady travelling on my own, I felt safe at all times."
16,924,"Jul 11 2009 	Great location and value for money.	Knowing room sizes in London are very small was pleasantly surpised by room 110. Had a bath and toileteries, even a/c. Comfortable bed, tea and coffee facilities. Hotel has a lift and no smoking rooms. Staff very pleasant and helpful and spoke reasonable english. Close to Kensgington Gardens and Lancaster Gate tube station. Would stay here again if come to London. Friday or Saturday night might be noisy on outside street windows when patrons come out to smoke late at night. Consider it good value for money."
17,924,"Jul 9 2009 	Great value for money	Like some other reviewers I chose this hotel because of its proximity to Hyde Park as my friend and I were attending the Hard Rock Calling concert, and location wise this was perfect. Lancaster Gate tube is a couple of minutes walk and Hyde Park is at the end of the road, with the Lancaster Gate entrance only a few yards away. There are a couple of great pubs in the local area  The Mitre in Craven Terrace and also The Black Lion at Lancaster Gate, and the hotel itself also has a Russian bar downstairs.The hotel looks a little tired and chintzy, but all it needs is a lick of paint and a bit of modernization. It was clean &amp; quiet and the staff were friendly &amp; helpful. The hotel were happy to look after your luggage free of charge if you arrived early, or if you needed to leave your bags for a while once youd checked out.Our room number was M1 and we paid 69 per room per night for 2 sharing, and this price included breakfast. In comparison to some other hotels in the area, this was a bargain. The included breakfast was continental, but was more than adequate, and I have to compliment the breakfast staff particularly as they were really lovely.Please understand this is a 2 star hotel, so if you book it expecting 5 star luxury then you will be very disappointed. However, I liked this hotel a lot, so much so I booked it again for the following week."
18,924,"Jul 7 2009 	Good value	This hotel is a bit shabby, but it's location and room size make up for that. It was clean and comfortable with great airconditioning and a basic but edible breakfast. I would stay again."
19,924,"Jun 30 2009 	AVERAGE!	Had high expectations after reading all the reviews on tripadvisor (which was one of the reasons I chose this hotel in the first place!) The second reason being that I wanted a hotel close to Hyde Park as we were going to Hard Rock Calling held at the Park. Anyway, the location was great for that reason, but very little else. It was very warm over the weekend, and unfortunately, so was the London Guards Hotel! We were'nt expecting air-con, but windows which actually opened would have helped! The rooms were old fashioned, but the only good thing in it was a fridge which was very handy as it was so warm! Breakfast was 'continental' which consisted of boxed cereals, two choices of juice, cheese, yogurt, toast and 'croissants' which were hardly authentic! On our first morning, there was also a couple of apples and bananas on offer, but sadly none on the second! We were on the first floor, and when we came out of our two rooms and walked down the stairs, we were greeted with the sight of the laundry room with bags and bags of dirty laundry on display all over the floor! Not very welcoming! But I have to say the hotel was clean which is very important, but if you do not need stay in the area which doesn't have much facilities around, then I would suggest you look elsewhere."
20,924,"Jun 29 2009 	A wonderful hotel....	Value for money, very helpful staff and comfortable room. Breakfast was good with a variety of cereals and the staff there were nice. Located in a quiet and beautiful area, it is a short walk to Hyde Park and the Queensway area where one can get food and plenty of souvenirs... The Lancaster Gate tube and Paddington station are also within walking distance."
21,924,"Jun 8 2009 	It is cute and sweet	We were very happy with this hotel. It was a descent price for London, but I'm sure you could find better. It is very clean and comfortable. We liked the decoration and the breakfast was acceptable. The staff was friendly and helpful. It was a bit hard to find at first but it is about a 10 minute walk to the tube and hyde park. It has plenty of small shops and restaurants nearby. Overall, it is a good hotel, in a quiet and safe neighborhood."
22,924,"May 24 2009 	Great Hotel for the money	No complaints.comfortable,friendly and polite staff.Nice breakfast.Added bonus of Russian bar down below serving till all hours apparently.At this price you can&quot;t go wrong,across the road from Hyde Park.Definetley stay again ."
23,924,"May 8 2009 	central charming value for money needs better staff training and it could be a first class hotel	we were given Room M2 which was beside and below a school party. the noise was terrible. the first morning we were awakened from our sleep at 6am with them jumping off beds. when we returned at 5pm that evening balls were bounced off walls and doors banging. next morning was worse. it began at 5am. the staff didnt seem too bothered and one surly male receptionist glared at us for complaining. we were saddened by this as the location, rooms and breakfast were super . we woulde go again but would request a qwuiter room."
24,924,"Apr 26 2009 	Thought it will be good...	After reading all the reviews, thought this hotel will be really good for one night stay!!!As we were travelling with friends, booked two double/twin rooms!!!As we got there, we asked for rooms next to each other or at least on the same floor, but our request was refused!!!Friends got lovely room on 1st floor with double bed, but we got room on second floor with THREE SINGLE beds with no chance to get two together!!!!! I was ready to go downstairs and argue, but my partner said - never mind, thanks God we're staying just for 1 night, we can't ruin our holidays arguing in hotel, so we spent night seperated. Don't understand how dull you must be to give a couple a triple room!!!Staff in breakfast room was nice and breakfast overall was ok!!!"
25,924,"Apr 14 2009 	Cheap but maybe not worth it.	My husband and I stayed at the London Guards Hotel for three nights in March 2009. What can I say, it depends on what you value in a hotel. The hotel is some what easy to get to from Paddington station. There are two lines near the hotel to use to get into downtown London. It is across from the park and is on a cul-de-sac, which made it very quiet. The room was small, but clean. The breakfast was the bare minimum. The staff was the real issue; they had no clue how to get to any of the major site, nor where to eat. Even when asked the simplest questions they seemed annoyed, like their only job is to check you instrange.Good note is just a quick 10 minute walk is Bays Water Street which has tons of restaurants. I personally will never stay there nor would I strongly recommend anyone else to, but if you want somewhere cheap and do not require any amenities, then this might be the place for you."
26,924,"Apr 6 2009 	OK now this was a bargain...	Ok, my partner and I stay in London a lot and always pay arounf 150 a night for central West End locations, we booked a night at the Radisson Edwardian Sussex for last Saturday night but on Friday we decided we would travel down that night, get a travel inn or something cheap, so we would be in London early the next day.OK, the room was very large and fairly clean. The bathroom was huge. There was a little noise during the night but nothing too major. The building is what I would expect from a 3* and the location isn't too bad, still in zone 1 after all. Here'e the thing, for bed and breakfast, this place cost 35 for a double room!! How cheap is that?! The last time I paid that little for a hotel it was for a box room in a B&amp;B in Blackpool! Obviously worth every penny if you can get it for this price!To be honest I probably wouldn't go back, because we do prefer a little luxury, but if you're on a budget in London this is definitely somewhere to consider."
27,924,"Mar 19 2009 	Excellent Value For Money	Stayed on 16th and 17th March. Room was sufficent, bathroom also. Was surprised to see this bearing in mind the normal shoebox size of both in these sort of London Hotels. Breakfast fine, flexible on when you take it and the location is wonderful, right opposite the entrance to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. At 62 per night, you can't go wrong."
28,924,"Mar 8 2009 	Nice central hotel - good price - great location	Stayed here for two nights on 2 &amp; 3 March 2009 with my mother. Hotel was easy to find, at the top end of Lancaster Gate on the right hand side. It has a red door.We were allocated a great room - very large by London standards, which was clean, quiet, had an ensuite bathroom, fresh clean towels every day &amp; lots of soap/shampoo sachets, excellent hairdryer, coffee/tea making facilities which were replenished daily and a fridge. Decor was a little dated but this gave the hotel some character. I don't understand the previous complaints about the inclusive breakfast - ther was everything a continental breakfast should have and plenty of it! Lovely fresh orange juice. Location of the hotel was good - 5 mins walk from Lancaster Gate tube station and yes you can see Hyde Park from the hotel - just!We will be staying again next time we're in the &quot;Big Smoke!&quot;"
29,924,"Feb 28 2009 	Great Hotel great location	If your looking for a hotel that is affordable, nice, had breakfast, and has a great location, your search is over. We were traveling with a group of 4 (2 couples, 27 - 30 years old), and elected to stay in a family room with 2 double beds. The rooms are very nice, don't expect state of the art decor, but clean comfortable rooms that the normal traveler will find more than adequate. The staff at the hotel was very friendly, especially the breakfast staff. The continental breakfast is not elaborate, but it is enough to save you a meal and some money each day of your stay. The location in my opinion cannot be beat. The hotel is 2 blocks away from the Lancaster Gate Tube stop, which is on the central line. On your way to the Tube, stop by the Swan Pub for a good beer and very good food. The biggest plus location wise is the fact that the hotel is directly off Hyde Park, which is beautiful. Hotel guests can walk through the park to a number of tourist sites. Give this hotel a try, you won't regret it."
30,924,"Feb 15 2009 	Charming	This was a very charming hotel above average for a three star hotel. We had a charming familyroom(difficult to find in London). Very big for London. It was clean with a lovely view of Hyde Park. The staff was friendly and helpful. Everything worked perfect for example late arrival, working some minor problems out . Breakfast was a bit poor but ok. The location was just perfect and very quiet area."
31,924,"Feb 7 2009 	Amazing value for money!	I booked a single room but was upgraded to a double room which was huge and had a couch! The room was in the basement, but I didn't mind. The building is old and has a lot of character, but the room was very modern and clean - digital TV, well heated, air conditioner, etc. Breakfast was basic and good - fresh fruit, toast etc.Location is good - near the Lancaster Gate underground station or near buses which go to Piccadilly Circus in one direction and Notting Hill in the other direction. Also walking distance (about 10 minutes) from Paddington station - where the Heathrow Airport trains come to and go from. You can also walk through Hyde Park and be at Harrods in about 10 minutes. Nearby Queensway has a lot of good cheap Chinese food.The internet is a bit expensive, I recommend that you walk down to Queensway (5 mins) where you can get 1.5 hours for a pound."
32,924,"Jan 29 2009 	Great family room	Stayed here with 4 children 18 to 10 years old. Hotel is well located, and the large family room(there are two of them the same), was fantastic value for money (for London!). Hotel and rooms are clean, and well set up. Staff are very accomodating. Breakfast is good with a full English upgrade available. Pubs, restuarants, laundromat all handy, and a 100m stroll to Hyde Park - great."
33,924,"Dec 27 2008	Our Experience	Staff very friendly , the conditions of our room was very pleasant unfortunately if you happen to stay at Room # M1 BE AWARE of all night long activities in the room above , perhaps Room # M3 , loud disturbing noises throughout the night and management did not take appropriate course of action , it seems to be a working room .Other than that this hotel is located in a very tranquil area of Western London , in close proximity of the every popular Hyde Park , and conveniently sells fabulous tours of historic London . Recommended."
34,924,"Oct 21 2008 	Great location Quaint Hotel	Our family enjoyed a pleasant stay at the London Guards. The family room catered very well for our needs, was nicely decorated and the location of the hotel is wonderful for the sites of London and situated in an attractive quiet area. We found the breakfast to be ample with a good selection. Would highly recommend for a family trip to London."
35,924,"Oct 12 2008 	Take your chances!!	What an odd experience we had at the London Guards. We booked for two nights -- exactly one week apart. On our first night, we were given a room that was just fine. Very nice view, clean, comfortable, nice large bath. I was actually going to right a very good review upon my return. On the second night there we were given a room that almost seemed to be in a different hotel. It was the worst hotel room I have ever had - anywhere! The bathroom was moldy and the shower was so small that the curtain kept sticking to me. Think twice before taking your chances on this hotel."
36,924,"Oct 11 2008 	Had two rooms One OK One not OK	We where a family of four that stayed for 4 nights in October 2008.One room was nice. The other room had an OK bedroom, but the bathroom smelled terrible. A lot of mould at the roof, but the most smell came throug the waterlock in the floor. ( We tryed to fill it with water, but that just improved, not removed the smell)It was not possible to turn on the heat in either of the bathrooms, hotel policy we where told. If we had not had this room with this bathroom, we would have given the hotel a rating Above average.Both rooms where nicely cleaned each day.Breakfast was better than what we expected based upon other travellers review. Very polite and helpfull staff in the breakfast restaurant."
37,924,"Oct 3 2008 	Great Value for a London Hotel	My husband and I stayed at the London Guards Hotel for 10 nights. The hotel is in an excellent location for getting around London. The tube is very close and Paddington station is not a far walk away. The area is safe to walk at night, great pub close by (the Swan) and shops where you can purchase snacks to take back to your room. Our room was large, very clean, had a fridge, coffee/tea, a safe and quiet. If you are wanting something fancy, this is not the place for you. But if you want a place to sleep that is clean and convient...this is it!!! The breakfast room had great friendly staff. Enough food to get your day started...very adequate.... great yogurt!! I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. When returning to London again, I would book with Expedia and the London Guards hotel. It was a great experience."
38,924,"Sep 28 2008 	Wish we could have stayed longer	Arriving at London Guard hotel around 10am after arriving from Australia on a late flight into Heathrow, we found the check in quick and pleasant. Unlike many hotels, we where not required to pay until check out.The lift was handy to get us to our room with four cases, back packs etc. Our family room was pleasant, clean, spacious, and the two queen size and one single bed where so comfortable we slept soundly and woke refreshed the next morning. The bathroom was roomy, clean, everything worked and there was clean soft thick towels each day.Hyde Park being so close we went for a nice walk through the park before breakfast. The breakfast staff where so thoughtful with the boys making them hot chocolate specially, instead of the tea and coffee offered to us. Breakfast was the usual continental serve your self style, which we found good quality plentiful enjoyable food. The girls served us with hot drinks and promptly cleared and wiped the tables as guests finished and left the room.There was free internet access for our laptop in our room and also free computers down stairs in the lounge. Desk staff where helpful and pleasant.The hotel is close to bus services, which run along Bayswater road either to Notting Hill, Marble Arch, and further. Paddington is quite close, Little Venice is just a bit further where a canal boat ride is worthwhile and an enjoyable ride going up to Camden town.The location of this hotel is such that most London attractions are easy accessible by foot, bus, tube or canal. The London Zoo is also close by.There are plenty of places to eat either locally or just up the road at Notting Hill.We had a lovely three day stay from 28th June until 1st July and wished we could have stayed longer."
39,924,"Sep 23 2008 	Don't pay in advance!	Zoom Airlines went out of business. I had three hotel reservations booked in London and Amsterdam. One of the London hotels (Luna Simone) let us out of our reservation without charging their posted 20 pound per night fee. The Amsterdam B&amp;B (Boogards) also released us without charging a penny. London Guards hotel, however, KEPT ALL THREE NIGHTS PAYMENT. Now, I will say that their cancellation policy was very clear (no refund, exchange, etc for the special internet rate), but I still feel that they have taken advantage of a bad situation. We were not in a position to fork out another $2500CDN to replace out tickets to Europe, and we expect to go in the next 12 months. We asked if they would consider giving us a credit towards our future trip. Their only communication was to send their policy page to us. We gave them over 3 1/2 weeks notice. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. You can understand that when we do travel, we won't be staying at a place that is happy to get doubly paid for their accomodations."
40,924,"Sep 22 2008 	Loved It	Ballina, Australia. We stayed at the London Guards Hotel for Ten nights ( Partner and 11yr old Daughter). We have no complaints, we were terrified after reading hundreds of reviews for London Hotels and were so happy when we arrived at the London Guards - Its not 5 star but it is in a beautiful location close to Transport, restaurants etc.The staff were friendly and helpful, the staff in the breakfast room were really sweet to our daughter, we were kind of sad to leave.Our room was huge and it had a fridge, which is pretty rare in London. Would definately recommend this Hotel, just have to remember that it is a 3 star Hotel and if your expectations are really high go to the Ritz."
41,924,Sep 13 2008 	Disappointing	We stayed in London for 3 nights. We found our stay at the London Guards Hotel to be disappointing.The hotel is conveniently just outside of Hyde park and very close to an underground station - this was very nice. The rooms are old and in a desperate need of upgrading. It smells funny and wall paper is falling off the walls. I found little black hairs in my bed. The breakfast was extremely basic... but food is food. We stayed here for $200Canadian/night and it was by far the worst (and surprisingly most expensive)hotel we stayed in all of Europe.
42,924,"Sep 11 2008 	Good hotel exceptional value for money	Meand my girlfriend checked into the London Guards Hotel at very last minute through laterooms. We've stayed twice, for 45 and 35 and both rates included breakfast.Both times the rooms have been comfortable (1 huge and 1 small - average size). It's very clean and tidy with generous tea / coffee and toiletries provided.You always get the odd tripadivsor reviewer comparing London prices to elsewhere and expecting much more for their money, but in my experience and given the Paddington / Bayswater location, the London Guards Hotel offers exceptional value and safe, clean accommodation for a night out."
43,924,"Aug 24 2008 	Good location mediocre accomodations	This hotel offers a nice location near Bayswater tube and a short walk to Hyde Park. Hotel facade is appealing, however rooms and public areas are run down, ie. old carpets. Room was small, but comfortable for a couple - bathroom was full sized and clean. Small fridge and TV are nice additions to this modest room.Very basic continental breakfast is complimentary. English breakfast is offered at a cost, but better to experience the full English breaky at a pub or restaurant nearby - plenty of options at lower prices. Decent value for someone looking for a clean bed to sleep in at night and not caught up in decor."
44,924,Aug 2 2008 	Great Location	We booked this hotel with our flight to London. The hotel is older but very clean. We found our room to be fine - nothing luxurious but we were only there to sleep. Toiletries and hair dryer were provided and ironing board brought to the room upon request. We arrived in the morning and they were able to get us in right away. If this had not been possible - they would have taken our bags so we could begin our sightseeing. The staff was very polite and helpful. A very basic continental breakfast was provided. This was not much to speak of but considering we didn't know that it was included - it was OK. We loved the location - very close to all transportation yet out of the bustle and congestion of the city. 2 blocks from bus or tube. I would stay here again without question. Good value.
45,924,"Jul 30 2008 	Great value great location	My wife and I stayed at the London Guards Hotel for 5 nights, 2nd -6th Jun and approached it with fingers crossed after a couple of duds in Europe. Great loaction at Lancaster Gate, minutes from the bus and tube, 5 minutes from Hyde Park. Good hotels and cafes within 10 minutes walk, clean, bit old and tired but for a value hotel in central London, we enjoyed it, helped by friendly staff. The breakfast is adequate. Another tick for the travel agent."
46,924,"Jul 15 2008 	Great rates clean rooms	We planned our European vacation down to the last detail, and researched every hotel very carefully. We had excellent stays everywhere we went, but I was a little nervous about this hotel, the last one where we would be staying. It was a pleasant surprise. We booked it long ahead of our trip and got an excellent price. The neighborhood was clean and felt safe. There was even a decent pub and small convenience store nearby. We travelled with our parents and booked two rooms. Both were very clean and spacious. The breakfast was good, not great, but met our needs. The staff were helpful, and we enjoyed our five nights here. I would stay again."
47,924,"Jul 1 2008 	OK for the price	Our party of 10 (4 kids--6 adults) stayed here for 6 nights during the 2nd week of June. Beware of the vast difference in room size. 2 or our 3 rooms were VERY small, the 3rd room was HUGE, actually more like a small apartment. Breakfast was simple, but adequate with cold cereals, yougurt, crossiants, toast, butter, jam, juices, milk, hot coffee and hot tea. Staff was polite. LOTS OF STAIRS to navigate, elevator is very small. Showers were good, but water was cold some days. service in all three of our rooms was very good. Shampoo, soap all provided--but remember to bring your own washclothes! 2 pay computers access the internet. Cost is around 1 pound ($2.00) for 1/2 hour. Subway station less than 1 block away. Hyde Park is also very close, VERY nice place to take the kids, go out for a jog or a nice walk. Nice area, we always felt safe. The hotel is located in a quiet area with many other hotels that seemed equal in price and value."
48,924,"Jun 27 2008 	Quite Nice	Very nice room. Furnishings were fresh and comfortable. Nice full bath. Very convenient location to Lancaster Gate Tube and restaurants.Staff very alert and helpful.Very basic breakfast.Good,safe, Quiet area across from Kensington Gardens."
49,924,"Jun 27 2008 	Great Hotel	Stayed for a full week. Had booked a Twin room but on arrival had been allocated a double. This was upgraded to a triple room and was really spacious. Amenities were excellent. Breakfast was more than adequate, and kept us going nearly all day. One or two mornings were a little hectic-- too many people and too few tables, but what is a little wait? The staff were very friendly and helpful. Will DEFINATELY stay here again. Dianne HODKINSON . Cheshire"
50,924,"Apr 25 2008 	Good location poor service	We were four people (2 adults and 2 children), we had a stay in this hotel in April, 2008, for 4 nights. The hotel is quite well located, not far from Lancaster Gate metro station. We had booked a quad room, which was large and quiet, with 2 single beds and one double bed. The bathroom was clean and ok. The cable TV had only 2 TV channels with very bad quality. The breakfast is clearly a weak point, with little choice. The hotel staff is not welcoming at all, especially at the reception. To summarize : well-located but poor service"
51,924,"Apr 16 2008 	London hotels are expensive; London Guards good value for money	Booked the London Guards based on previous reviews. It turned out to be exactly as we expected - basic,clean,convenient.If you leave Lancaster Gate tube station and turn right (Hyde Park will be on your left), keep walking along Bayswater Road until you come to a church on your right - the hotel is behing the church in a quiet cul de sac.We arrived early morning before a room was available but we were able to leave our bags and return later. On the day of departure we also left our bags at reception. We found the reception staff helpful when we asked for information - otherwise they left us alone which is quite acceptable to us. The breakfast, while basic, was adequate and while the staff weren't exactly bubbly they were efficient. They even brought extra tea bags when I said the tea was too weak!The room was clean - plenty of coathangers! The pillows were thin - I guess as a moan that wouldn't rate!As for London - there is so much to do and see. We took a bus trip on the Big Bus Co. It was no great shakes, but the walking tour which was included was definitely worthwhile. If you want to economise you could skip the bus trip and just pay 5 for the guided walk which leaves from Trafalger Square."
52,924,"Mar 14 2008 	Full of character	We have just returned from a three-night stay at this hotel, and had a very enjoyable time. The twin room was clean and spacious, the only niggle being that there were just four coathangers in the wardrobe - if you find it hard to travel light like me, you may want to pack a couple of hangers. Beds were extremely comfortable, and the full-size fridge was well stocked with little pots of UHT milk to go with the coffee and tea provided.All the staff were very polite and helpful - we were greeted with towels when we first arrived in the middle of a downpour, which was a nice touch. Breakfast was basic, which is what we were expecting, having read previous reviews, but for the price we paid, we did not expect too much. The coffee had an unusual taste - instant would have been better - and there was a bit of a queue at the toasters, but everything was clean and supplies of cereal and juice were topped up regularly.Minor moans - we were woken one morning by a noisy family above us who seemed to be rushing around in their room packing at about 5.30 in the morning and were certainly not making any attempt to keep noise levels down, and several times doors were slammed and goodbyes yelled when people returned to their rooms at night, but the hotel can hardly be blamed for a few guest's inconsiderate behaviour. Overall, a lovely little hotel with a lot of character, and a great location."
53,924,"Mar 9 2008 	Excellent location	We stayed here for a 3 night break with our 6 year old son during February. We choose it due to favourable reviews and its location - across Hyde Park to the museums and walking distance to Paddington. The hotel is easy to find and quietly located. We regularly walked to Paddington for the tube or to eat (very large choice of restaurants). Lancaster Gate tube station is very close along Bayswater Road.Our triple room (ground floor) had an interesting layout with stairs from the bedroom up to the bathroom and tea making facilities. The room was clean and tidy, the bathroom was large though sink had no plug but used the bath one! Breakfast was included and was very nice - cereals (even the rice krispies and cornflakes tasted like branded versions not cheap catering types), croissants, toast, yoghurts, tea/coffee (top ups offered) and juices. Our son was offered hot chocolate and hot milk also. We don't eat full fried breakfasts so this was exactly what we wanted! The staff were fabulous - I firmly believe it's how you treat people that determines your service - smile and say good morning and a thank you after and I'm sure those less satisfied may have found their experience most enjoyable! Front desk staff were exceptionally helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip - it was superb value at 91 per night total b&amp;b for the 3 of us. We have rebooked for late July and can't wait to go back."
54,924,"Mar 7 2008 	The Worst Hotel EVER	Myself, mother &amp; daughter booked 3 nights in early February. We were booked into a triple room on the top floor. The elevator was a very old, scary, small frieght elevator with carpet on the walls. In our room the 3 single beds were mattressses on wooden boxes and very uncomfortable. The TV was on top of the wardrobe with poor reception and the remote did not work. Worst of all the bathroom reeked so bad of sewer I was gagging. After a few hours I called the Front Desk and told them we would be leaving the next day. I said although the room wasn't what we wanted, I would pay for the next night because of early check out.By midnight the first night, my daughter became very ill and I called the Front Desk to ask where the nearest hospital was. The Clerk kept saying 'I do not know this'. I finally asked for a taxi and was shocked when a private town car picked us up. I asked for the nearest hospital as I was almost carrying my 16 year old. He drove 3 blocks and dropped us off telling us to just walk down the alley to St. Marys, and charged 20 pounds!!My daughter was treated and discharged at 8am and we returned to the hotel. I told the Front Desk we would be leaving at 3pm as we were paying for that 2nd night anyways and he said fine.When we came down at 3pm he told me the manager said i had to pay for all 3 nights as I had not confirmed we were going. I was amazed!! This is the same clerk I had spoken to every time. I asked for the manager and he said he was out and was not sure what time he was returning. What a crock!! I left a message for his manager detailing my feelings and took my sick kid and elderly mother out of that hole!As a Manager of a hotel on Vancouver Island I was horrified by everything we experienced at this place. We moved to a great little hotel in Chelsae and paid an extra $10.00 and had a wonderful experience. We returned home to find a form letter from the London Guards thanking us for our stay and urging us to contact them if we return to Britian. I would rather be buried alive. Go elsewhere."
55,924,"Feb 19 2008 	Quiet hotel in good location	I booked this room on the internet for myself and my two children (13 and 11) for a short break in London. The hotel was clean and all the staff were pleasant and very helpful.Breakfast was included and it was a cold buffet, fairly limited; toast, cereals, fruit juice, yoghurts etc. No cheese, meat or fruit.The room we were given was very small but clean and in good repair. The hotel is very quiet at night, there is no road noise at all and you wouldn't know you were in central london even though you are walking distance, accross the park, from Harrods.It was good value and I would stay here again."
56,924,"Feb 11 2008 	You get what you pay for	Having read the previous reviews and booking the London Guards we were left wondering who had actually written some of the extremely positive comments?! That is not to say it was bad just not as good as we had hoped. The good points were the location (2 mins walk from Lancaster Gate tube), the size of the room (huge with 5 beds (!) - 2 doubles and a single), it was in a quiet location and was clean. However the hotel was somewhat dated and in need of a bit of an update. The desk in the room was made from a leftover bit of kitchen worktop (rather out of keeping in what was once a lovely old building I'm sure), the lift was out of order (despite being directed towards it by the reception staff), and the breakfast was extremely poor. The price we paid was good for London though I suppose and we didn't spend that long actually in it to be honest. Might stay again if I couldn't find anything else reasonable."
57,924,"Feb 5 2008 	Good hotel great location	We are two adults and three teenagers and we had a family room with one double and three single beds. Room was spacious and clean. Front desk staff were friendly and let us check in early. Breakfast was good, toast, cereal, yoghurt and instant (yuk) coffee. It was difficult to find the hotel from the maps we printed from the website but this may have been due to jet lag after a 36 hour journey from Australia. The location is very good - close to the tube and Hyde Park. December in London was freezing and the hotel was a lovely warm refuge. In hindsight it was one of the best value for money hotels we stayed at during our European holiday."
58,924,"Jan 27 2008 	Good value	This hotel is simply good value for money. It's not a five star hotel, but then the rates are not five star either. Stayed in a triple, or more like a quad, room with two single and one queen size bed. Room was clean and nice and had both coffee and tea making facilities and a fridge. Big plus for the fridge! Room was quite spacious, bath kind of tiny but clean and well functioning. The queen size and two beds were in different parts of the room and made it almost like having two rooms with shared bath - also a big plus. Some seating options would have been appreciated, but no big deal, I accept sitting on the bed when rates are this good. The complimentary breakfast was good, nothing special but no reason to complain either. Staff polite but I didn't exactly get the impression I made their day by stopping by. A smile or two wouldn't kill them, but they stayed on the safe side, just in case. It was a challenge to find the hotel, it's kind of anonymous and hidden. Probably would have been easier if I took the time to study a map before arrival. From Lancaster Gate underground, walk straight up Bayswater Road towards Queensway, turn right when you see a church and the hotel is right behind it. In a quiet and great location, close to underground, Queensway and Hyde Park. Unless you're expecting a five star hotel for the price of a three star, you won't be disappointed."
59,924,"Jan 3 2008 	Small beds poor service still decent value for money	My wife and I staid at the London Guards hotel for two nights in November 2007 while stopping in London for some sightseeing and pre-christmas shopping.The hotel is very conveniently located just north of Hyde Park and in easy walking distance to Lancaster Gate, Bayswater and Queensway Tube stations as well as to the Bayswater area with many Restaurants for all tastes.We got a very small room overlooking the (in our experience quiet) street. The room was so small, that there was literally not space for walking around the bed once we had put our bags down. We had booked a double room, but the bed looked more like a single to us. We managed to sleep ok but it was not particularily comfortable. We also tried to get an extra blanket as it was quite cold in the room at night, unfortunately it took over two hours and at least two additional reminder calls to reception to actually get it.The breakfast on the first day was basic and not very good and we didn't bother to go on the second day.We didn't really enjoy our stay, but i guess you can't expect much more for this price."
60,924,"Dec 31 2007	As the Brits say ""Well Done""	This appeared to be a hotel in the middle of an upgrade - painting was occurring. But this was not a problem. In fact, the improvements were very nice.The rooms were large, the price very reasonable ($150 per night) and the staff very courteous. The location was exceptional, only one block to Hyde Park.If there was a fault it was more an annoyance. The breakfast staff chatted noisily and continuously while we were eating."
61,924,"Dec 11 2007	Decent Hotel Good Location	I liked the location of this hotel, very near Paddington Station and the Underground. I also liked the price: $71 for a Sunday in December. Checkin was easy, the room was decently appointed if unspectacular and basically clean, and the coffee supply and shower were acceptable. In other words I would rate this place as completely acceptable if looking for a relatively inexpensive place to stay in London close to a cool neighborhood and with easy public transportation access to the rest of London."
62,924,"Dec 10 2007 	Good value for money	I booked two single rooms via Londonnghts.com for my friend and I as we were visiting London for a spa day treat and an overnight stay. My friend had two double beds and one single in her very large room, and I had a double bed in mine. The rooms were clean and comfortable, bathroom had toiletries, and there was a hairdryer and fridge in rooms. The breakfast has obviously improved a little bit since some of the reviews I had read before we went, as in addition to the toast, croissants and cereal, there was cheese (but only processed cheese slices), yogurt and fruit juice. It is a very basic breakfast but the B&amp;B rate was so cheap that I think that is perfectly acceptable. The hotel is near to the Lancaster Gate tube stop and close to hyde park, and about a 20 -30 minute easy walk to the Marble Arch end of Oxford Street. I would stay there again, I think it is good value for money."
63,924,"Dec 4 2007 	Good Clean Hotel for the money	Stayed in this hotel for my last two days in England. The room was clean yet sparse. Hotel staff was friendly enough, I didn't try the breakfast (English breakfasts were not to my liking anyway). Location was lovely and close to tube stations and Oxford Street, a great place to get last minute gifts. Overall a good deal for the location in London and would certainly stay here again."
64,924,"Dec 3 2007 	Good location Quiet hotel	I booked this hotel using [--] but you can also book on their website as well. Londonnights may give you a little bit of a discount. There were good reviews on Tripadvisor so we looked forward to it. London Guards is located on a quiet square in Bayswater, a very short walk from the Lancaster Gate tube stop and not much further from Queensway, Bayswater and Paddington stations so you're in a very good location for transportation. It's about a 15 - 20 minute walk to Oxford Street and you're only 2 minutes from Hyde Park as well. The room came with continental breakfast which was fine. You could order a cooked breakfast for an additional cost. The room was spacious and clean and it had a small fridge as well as the usual tea/coffee facilities. Average sized bathroom with tub and shower. Hotel has a lift but some rooms also may be up a few stairs as ours was. Ask if there's a mobility issue for you. They have singles right up to family size rooms. Bed was a little hard for me, however that's a matter of individual taste. Cost is in the vicinity of about 70 - 75 pounds for a double/twin which is pretty reasonable for central London with a quiet location and close to transport. Lots of restaurants in the area near Paddington and Queensway. Can walk straight across Hyde Park for 10 minutes to get to Albert Hall, the V&amp;A and Natural History museum. Also, bus 274 goes from Lancaster Gate all the way to Camden which we really loved."
65,924,"Nov 4 2007 	Small but quaint - Great location	We stayed at the London Guards hotel for 3 nights, found it very serviceable &amp; clean. It was very close to hyde park &amp; the lancaster gate tube station. The included breakfast was standard fare, nothing to rave about though."
66,924,"Oct 30 2007 	great budget hotel	This hotel is situated a two minute walk from Hyde Park and close to Lancaster Gate tube station making it perfect for accessing the hustle and bustle of Oxford Street and the rest of London but also giving the option of a quiet walk through the park to the Natural History Museum if this is more your scene.The room my daughter and I were given had a double and single bed, television, fridge and bathroom with a shower over the bath, The accomodation, whilst a bit dated, was very clean and the staff helpful.The reviews I read before visiting were generally critical of the breakfast but we were quite happy with the continental option and found it perfectly adequate.I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone on a budget wanting a convenient and clean place to stay."
67,924,"Oct 11 2007 	chmcsouza	We stayed 6 nights at London Guards. The hotel is clean, the rooms are nice with comfy beds and a good bathroom. The neighbourhood it's quiet. It's easy to get the subway from there and you are 2 blocks away from Kensington Park. The service is cold and the breakfast ok."
68,924,"Oct 9 2007 	Top value for Budget Hotel	We had a good experience at this hotel. We had read the reviews before we went so we were a bit apprehensive as to our accommodation. We stayed in a room with 3 single beds. We had large suitcases but were able to lay them flat on the floor with enough room to walk around. The room was cleaned every day with clean towels. We had a bath with a shower over it. We were very pleased with the room. The staff at the front desk were helpful and I did hear them speak other languages besides English. As we had a laptop we were able to use the wifi in the lounge. The breakfast was as advertised. It is just a basic breakfast which was all we needed. If they wanted to improve the breakfast they could add some tinned fruit instead of yogurt. We went to the bar one night. It could be made more profitable by selling beers other than Russian beer, and it could be more guest friendly. However, there are lots of other pubs with great atmosphere in the area. The position of the hotel is excellent. It is only a short walk to Lancaster Gate tubestation, plus all the buses, and Hyde Park just one street away. We had read many reviews on the different hotels in London before we went over, and we feel that this hotel is good value for money. If you are expecting more than you are going to have to pay more."
69,924,"Oct 9 2007 	If you don't like noise	After reading some of the reviews we were surprised at the size of the room. A double bed, with very little room to put your suitcases. We book a room with twin beds, and when we arrived this was the only thing that was available (after booking two months earlier). The room was very clean and cleaned each day with fresh towels. The free breakfast was basic, cereal, yougurt, toast, and coffee. Now comes the bad stuff...noisy, noisy, noisy. the restaurant is run separate from the hotel so the bar was going all night, and because there is no smoking in the building, everyone congragated outside for a smoke 2-3am in the morning. Also next door to the hotel is a flat that is filled with forgein exchange students who sat outside most of the night drinking and smoking. Make sure you check the services provided for shuttle service to the airport. The post one price but is higher when you book, I dont think this the hotels fault but make sure you check."
70,924,"Oct 8 2007 	VERY VERY NICE VALUE FOR MONEYMANAGER VERY COOPERATIVE	Very Good Hotel, Value for money,Would certainlt recomend and stay again"
71,924,"Sep 17 2007 	Good Value-for-money	We booked a triple room and were pleasantly surprised by the size (Room202) and the huge windows. The bathroom was also larger than most budget hotels in London. The room and beddings were clean except for the bed covers which we did not use. The front desk staff during the day was very helpful. The breakfast was sub-standard. However, 5 minutes away close to the Bayswater tube is an entire street of local restaurants and shops which is very convenient. We also loved the quiet location and the Kensington Park across the street.HOWEVER, make sure you get a good internet rate. We booked our room for C$190 a night but found that at a later day the rate was C$600 for the same room possibly due to availability or events.SKY, Canada"
72,924,"Sep 2 2007 	Dirty!	Stayed only one night because the hotel was so poorly taken care of and dirty. The lobby looked clean and well taken care of but rooms were a different story. My room had a loft, which sounded good until I got to my room. The prink carpet was old and stained. The stairs leading to the loft were broken and ready to give out, not to mention a loose handrail. The bed was very uncomfortable. Overall the room was so filthy I forced myself into the dirty shower and had socks and shoes waiting near the bathroom door so my feet didn't have to touch the carpet. Not worth the savings!!! Spend a little more for a clean hotel room."
73,924,"Aug 16 2007 	I've stayed here for the past 10 years or so	I've been staying in London for 20 years now on a regular basis. 5 or 6 trips a year. Since the mid 80s I moved from hotel to hotel looking for a decent place that did not charge an arm and a leg. (Just try finding this in London!) In the late 90s I latched onto this place right after they opened up. I've been staying here ever since. I've stayed here probably 100 nights or moreIt is true that some of the AC units are not as cool as they used to be. It is true that the dining room is not the best. It is true that the carpets and such have some wear and tear. HOWEVER, FOR THE MONEY, this place can't be beat. They have huge rooms. You can request a fan. Each room has a hot pot and a refrigerator. Since eating in London is sooo expensive, I always go to the grocery store and buy food and bring it back. The fridge is a real bonus. You could find a cleaner hotel with a better restaurant, but you are going to choke when you see what they charge. This place is the best value for the money in this area of LondonPluses: Close to PaddingtonLocated in the corner of a quiet square. Request a room in the back of the hotel if you want complete quiet. Quiet is real important to me, so I weight this heavily in a hotelFridge in the roomPrivate Bath: You'd be surprised the number of places that don't have this when you get into the cheaper hotels in LondonLarge rooms: There are some small ones, but many of them are huge.Great location near Queensway. You can get most anything on this street and there is a mall there as well, and two tube stops.I know the staff now and I've always found them to be friendly.Minuses: Food. But I don't eat there.Restaurant: not the bestSmall towelsCarpets and spreads are tiredTV is very small. But I don't watch TV.No Internet connection. At least the last time I stayed there.All in All: a great great value.If someone out there knows a better value in that area. I'd like to know about it."
74,924,"Aug 8 2007 	Friendly and good value	We are a family of 2 adults and 3 children, and we booked 4 nights in a family room with 2 double and 1 single beds. The room was spacious for London, except for the hanging closet which was inadequate for 5 people. Clean and well maintained rooms and lobby, very friendly and helpful staff, especially at breakfast - which could have offered more variety. We had to supplement the breakfast with items we purchased from a local minimarket. Bathroom was modern and well ventilated. Main positive points: quiet but central location, airconditioning, roominess, friendly staff. Negative point: meager breakfast."
75,924,"Aug 4 2007	Good hotel....worth a return	Rooms had been updated, and had modern bathrooms, and airconditioning. There was a generous refrigerator, and the room was larger than other European rooms we'd had. The carpeting had seen better days, and there was no shower curtain in the bathroom. A hand held shower worked well. The elevator was slow. We walked down...and rode up to the fourth floor.The location was good, between two tube stops, and just a block from Hyde Park/Kensington gardens, so the walking around was great. Places to play if there were children. The street was quiet and pleasant.The housekeeping was immaculate, and prompt.The continental breakfast, included in the cost, was adequate, and served by very friendly people."
76,924,"Jul 23 2007 	Good budget hotel	Booked the hotel through venere.com, and got a very good price. 75 for a twin room in central London is not bad!The hotel is close to Lancaster gate tube station, Paddington station, and has several buses stopping just 1-2 minutes walk from the hotel.We'd booked a twin room, but got a family room with two single beds, one double bed, sofa, TV, fridge, and bathroom/WC. Good value for money.The hotel was clean and the receptionists were friendly. It's not a &quot;wow&quot; experience, but if you're not spending a lot of time in your room, and you're just looking for a cheap, nice hotel - this is perfect.I would NOT recommend the breakfast, which was the worst I've ever experienced at a hotel."
77,924,"Jul 21 2007	Mixed impressions	I must say that though a solo traveller, I booked a double/twin room, because the description of a single was not satisfactory. So, I can't comment on a single room and the value for money issue (a double room for one person doesn't come cheap). The room was cosy, spacious, clean. The air-conditioning was useful (as the weather was rather cold and rainy). Very important is always the safety box; it keeps you out of worry. The coffee-maker was OK, the refrigerator a plus. It was also a quiet room. The bathroom, although full of amenities, seemed &quot;rather tired&quot;, asking for &quot;upgrading&quot;. Unfortunately, the main elevator was out of order for a long time and the back-up one was to be avoided. The big problem was the breakfast: horrible! If you don't have to eat first thing in the morning, skip it! The front desk staff were correct, but not very friendly. Location: pretty good. Clean, safe, civilized surroundings, yet lack of pubs, shops. The bus stops were close. Suggestion: don't use the Underground. There are 4 bus lines (24 hours in service!) which can take you directly, or with easy connections, pretty much to all important sights. And the bus pass is very convenient!"
78,924,"Jun 16 2007 	Truly woeful	Where do I start:1 Asked for room at front with view- got basement room looking at concrete wall.2 Asked to have room changed and only got this done next day- then they put me in top floor and lift not working.3 Most unwelcoming bar- strong hint from barman that I should take drink to room rather than linger.4 Breakfast room dreary and smelly ; and breakfast pitifulA disgraceful establishment, dont stay there."
79,924,"Jun 6 2007 	Enjoyed our stay here	This is a very nice place for a family to stay who will be out sightseeing all day. It is clean and a very safe place to stay with only a 5 min walk from Lancaster Gate underground, 2 mini-markets, and also Hyde Park. The cleaners kept the room very clean and we had plenty of room with a nice-sized bathroom. The continental breakfast was fine for a light breakfast on the go(corn or bran flakes, croissants, rolls, juice, milk, coffee) I don't understand why some of the writers thought it was so bad. I've had far worse! The downstairs area doubles as a Russian bar and is where breakfast is served. It is clean and not problematic. The bar patrons could be heard leaving at closing time, but that was the only disturbance, other than early morning delivery trucks. The desk staff was courteous and helpful. We were pleased and would stay again."
80,924,"May 30 2007	Good value	My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for two nights. It has a charm, was clean and the staff was friendly. It is in a good location for travelling via the underground to see the sights of London. A bonus was the fridge in the room. I would definately reccomend this hotel."
81,924,"May 12 2007 	Terrible breakfast	Hotel situated in calm quiet area, with a very kind and careful staff.The room itself is very clean and wide though the first day we had troubles with the radiators.In general, a good hotel to stay in London, but the worst thing was the breakfast: bad attended, very poor, very small, bad smell, and if you want a simple chocolate you must pay for it (though we reservated our room with breakfast included!).Another strange thing which I didn't like was the fact that if you ask in reception for a taxi, they will call a particular driver who will collect you a 50% more money than a normal taxi tarif (I guess the hotel staff have a commision of that money).This &quot;taxi&quot; affair is not a strange thing in London, because I can tell ift is not the first time it happens to me."
82,924,"Apr 19 2007 	Good location	I and my teenage dughter stayed here on a four day trip to London, my daughter's first visit to London.Good: the price, the location: feels safe coming home at night for two women, right beside Hyde Park, really Londonish - white painted houses with porticoes - three bus stops from Oxford Street (my daughter is 16! Three hours in Topshop) and the bus also goes through Piccadilly which is door to door after a show on the West End. Great. Big room, clean. bright. quiet. Large fridge, which I expect would be great in the summer, especially with children. Could keep stocks for picnics in Hyde Park. (Hyde Park has boating, pedaloes and paddling pool).Less good: public areas not very inviting - more a guesthouse than hotel. Very little in the way of facilities in the hotel itself Bad: breakfast: served in basement in smelly room (smell identified as stale urine from toilets/drains?). Breakfast basic, coffee undrinkable. Tea OK. Not enough tables, had to wait, and table not cleared off. However: at these prices could forgive this, might even skip breakfast, with fridge could keep stock of cereal and milk in the room. Marks and Spencers only a few stops away on bus to stock up.If hotel reads this: could you serve breakfast on ground floor, improve the coffee and the orange juice a little? I think it would make a big difference.Note: if going to London: discover the buses: a great. really efficient way to get around, much more pleasant than tube, and you get to see London. The buses come every two minutes. With day or three day pass, really cheap and convenient and fun. They come so often it doesn't matter if you get the wrong one, you can quickly get back. Buses from this hotel go directly to Oxford Street, Tower, Piccadilly, and easy changes for everywhere else. The system is not at all as complicated as people make out, and well worth the effort to work it out. Try finding your tube line in one of the bigger stations with a couple of tired and slightly bewildered children: now that is difficult. Lots of families were staying while we were in this hotel, not surprised at the price and with the great location. Would be really good for a family with a child on any special diet, given the fridge.Receptionist really helpful re booking theatre tickets: I was rather stupid that morning, and she was very kind and helpful.I recommend the hotel for someone on a trip like mine. Great for anyone on a budget. If fussy, and wanting a 'HOTEL' and prepared to pay for it: maybe not."
83,924,"Feb 14 2007	Fear Not!	Having read the previous reviews, I stayed here with trepidation. But I had nothing to worry about. Yes it was cheap, but my basic requirements of white sheets, white towels and en-suite bathroom were met. It was clean and warm. The reception staff were courteous despite English not being their first language. Although I only stayed one night, the breakfast was adequate and with a fridge in the room had I been staying longer I could have stocked that with my own favourites. I was not disturbed by the Russian restaurant in the basement or by passing traffic. It is in the corner of a cul-de-sac so there is no passing traffic or pedestrians. Only one negative - is it that hard to programme the tv so BBC1 is on 1, BBC2 on 2 etc etc!!"
84,924,"Jan 31 2007	A total let down	We read the reviews and went with an open mind. We spent four nights here and our first impressions were the friendly welcome and smart Reception. We asked for a quiet room and were given a front room with a balcony, it was low on space due to two old chairs and an extremely long occasional table. The middle of the carpet was stained and the outer edges of the carpet were in need of a thorough clean as were the bed cover and the nets at the window. It was noisy at night time from the kitchens below and rowdy passers by, and some of the doors on our floor were noisy on closing.The bathroom was long however the shower head which is the old fashioned type is very high, and the plumbing with the toilet left much to be desired as we had to wait a full 20 mins before a second flush.The breakfast room smelt of food from the previous evening as this hotel serves Russian food and other continental foods, and it was dreary and unwelcoming. The table cloths were wine red and stained on two of the tables we used, nice white or pastel cloths would have been much nicer. The lady serving the coffee has no social graces so a Good Morning was asking too much. There is very little to eat, a choice of two cerials, bran flakes or cornflakes, juice and some rather ancient croissants. The coffee tasted disgusting and everyone seemed to vanish as quickly as possible once they had eaten. Two cups we were given had chips in the sides. The room is down some steep steps which are dimly lit, not suitable for anyone disabled.I have never encountered such a dark eating room in all of my travels, shabby and below street level.The lounge area was occupied by possibly a member of staff most evenings using a laptop and we sensed he did not wish for company. Apart from this person we never saw any other guest using the lounge.We requested a booking for a black cab but were told we could only have a private hire care. We asked at the local taxi rank if they would pick up and they told us to request Reception to arrange this and we explained they would not use black cabs.We would not stay here again. It is very over priced with little comfort, it is tired and dreary and needs some bright refurbishment, some clear cut interior decor and the retraining of breakfast staff. It needs to provide a better standard of food. The Reception staff however were efficient and friendly but if you book on line be sure to take along your documentation as they tried to overcharge us by over 100.A plentiful supply of coffee, tea and milk was available and the fridge was useful. The room had a heater.It is so convenient to Queensway, Baywater and the West End. It has easy access to Hyde Park and underground stations and a useful bus service with a direct route to Camden markets, The Angel at Islington etc. We used a daily bus pass to give travel on any bus, the cost of buying underground tickets has now become far too expensive at 4 with limited zones, paying 3.50 for a day rider gives one the ability to see parts of the London suburbs one would not normally visit.There are quite a few hotels in the area which seem not to be so well advertised however we have to admit each time we passed by we wished we had done more research. The next time we visit we will not be staying at London Guards"
85,924,"Jan 25 2007 	Hated it	It was cheap, which is about the only good thing I have to say about it.It was hard to find due to the vaugeness of the map provided.The room stunk of cigs despite our request for a non smoking room. The &quot;double bed&quot; was very narrow.The bath room was of a good standard except for the fact the shower head was so low it only came up to my chest!The bar was shockingly expensive even by London standards and the bar staff spoke hardly any English.Breakfast consisted of hard pastries and cereal with warm milk, nice."
86,924,"Dec 27 2006 	Great value in London!	When I heard my husband booked us a room in London for less than 100 GBP per night, I was a bit skeptical of what we would find. But, after arriving at Heathrow and taking the London Express to Paddington (a very easy and fast way to get downtown from the airport), we easily found the hotel at the back of a quaint cul-de-sac few blocks from the station. The front desk checked us in quickly and cheerfully and we arrived to our room on the first floor overlooking the front entrance. The room had nice high ceilings and a surprisingly large bathroom. Everything was clean, though the curtains, sitting chairs and bed linens were a bit worn. This is not a luxery hotel - it is basic. However, for the price it is very very impressive. The best feature in the room was a mini-fridge (which seemed to be brand new and was actually somewhat large). We kept water and snacks in there, which is helpful considering how much it costs to dine in London. We stayed three night and were very pleased with the location which was near 2 Tube stations and a strip of hip restaurants. The front desk was always helpful. The included breakfast was served in the lower level, and it really wasn't much to write home about, but you can get some coffee or tea to start your day with at least. The area seemed very safe and we were comfortable walking through the dark streets early in the morning to catch the London Express for our trip back out of Heathrow."
87,924,"Dec 7 2006	We hated this hotel!!!!	First of all we found the hotel very difficult to find. It wasn't explained clearly on the website. When we finally got there, we were received by a very un-friendly reception staff member. He told us he was unable to locate our reservation (even though it had been confirmed and paid for over 6 months ahead of time). He was completely unhelpful and wouldn't give us any kind of solution to this problem. Finally we urged him to show us all of the reservations he had for that night, and were able to find ours. He immediately threw a receipt at us and told us to sign it and write down our passport numbers clearly (implying that we were not to be trusted). We were very dissapointed with this treatment and will never return again, and would certainly not reccomend this hotel to anyone else!!! Please take our advice, and book somewhere else."
88,924,"Nov 24 2006	Decent Budget Hotel	I stayed at the London Guards Hotel in Nov. '06. This hotel is a decent budget hotel, emphasis on the budget. The room was clean and maintained and the staff was very friendly, although seemingly unaware of the neighborhood around them. Their directions got me lost on more than occasion. London is an expensive place so if youre running out of options, dont freak out this place isnt so bad once you get over the fact that its very quaint (but clean). When you pay $12 for a sandwich in London, you'll be happy you were able to save some money on your hotel."
89,924,"Nov 23 2006 	Give it a very wide berth	Apart from the location, this place was terrible. Tatty room. Extremely noisy air conditioning. Broken window lock. Room poorly cleaned. Breakfast not before 7.30am, ideal for those with an early start! I paid 89. The staff were friendly and smiled a lot, probably as a way of mitigating the dreadful experience of this lousy hotel."
90,924,"Nov 9 2006 	Did the job	I stayed at the London Guards hotel for three nights with my boyfriend. Good points: The staff were friendly and helpful, good location. warm, cosy decor, air conditioning + electric fan. The accommodtion was basic but comfortable and had everything we needed for out break.Not so good: The breakfast was nothing exciting (aldi cornflakes or branflakes, juice, tea, mini croissants, and bread rolls). The safe deposit box was locked. The girl at the desk said she'd send someone to fix it but didn't."
91,924,"Nov 8 2006 	OK Budget hotel	We stayed in London Guards hotel in tripple room in september 2006. Our room was decent size and it had fridge in the room. The room was also cleaned daily. On the third day of our stay we had problems with toilet in our bathroom which wouldn't flush. After we reported the situation to the reception the toilet was repaired on the same day. As others already noted the breakfast really is terrible so we mostly didn't bother with it. The staff at the hotel could also be a bit more knowledgeable about the area. When we stayed at the hotel the Lancaster tube station was closed so it was quite a walk to the nearest tube station (10-15 min). Overall, I would recommend this place to budget travelers if you get the deal like we did for 68 GBP per room per night otherwise it might be better to look elsewhere."
92,924,"Oct 12 2006 	Very satisfied	Large room with tall window and large bath as well. Refrigerator and television. Close to two metro stops, but in Bayswater there are few attractions. However, there is nightlife on Bayswater and another road a bit West. Hard to find the first time. Hardly saw any staff besides at the desk but they were friendly."
93,924,"Oct 7 2006 	Excellent value and location - recommended for budget travellers	We spent six nights at the London Guards at the end of September. Our room was quiet and large (for London standards) with two chairs, a desk, a bench, a wardrobe and lots of room for two exploded bags. The decor is old fashioned, but everything is very clean and the beds were comfortable (firm). The location is excellent, although beware the Lancaster Gate tube station is shut until later this year, although it's only a seven minute walk to Queensway. The reception staff were very friendly. The breakfasts were okay - again what you'd expect for London. Overall for 65 pounds a night we were very pleased. I can see that it would have been very hot during the heat wave as the air con was not flash. This is not a problem in the cooler months."
94,924,"Sep 14 2006 	Would go back anytime	Although there was only the two of us, we booked a triple room (for 3 nights) simply to give us more space than the usual double. It was totally worth the money. The staff was courteous. The air conditioning (which could have been a bit cooler) was nonetheless effective enough to make sleeping quite comfortable. The location is well away from traffic enough to make it a pleasant night."
95,924,"Aug 8 2006 	Disappointed	We reserved 2 rooms. One was air conditioned. The second one was a sweat box at best and while they kept promising that it would be fixed, it was not - we were there 3 days. The second room's air conditioning worked however, we had water running out of the vent onto the vanity on the second and third day of our stay. It was a great little water fountain! I threw our towels down to soak up and just barely got our belongings moved prior to getting soaked. Water also appeared around the base of the bathroom sink - I just threw down our used towels to soak up.The hotel ran out of bath towels so for our second and third days we had hand towels only. The bed linen was not changed daily as promised (I asked about this not knowing what the policy was and they said it was changed daily - a definite untruth!) they promised to change the bed when I called on the second day, saying it had not been changed but it was not. they said they would send someone up to change it and then called back about 1/2 hour later and said they could not.We always asked politely, but the answers were what we wated to hear and not the truth - not very good service."
96,924,"Aug 1 2006	Clean comfortable and cool!	We stayed at the hotel near the end of July 06 during extremely hot weather. Our room was a triple on the top floor. It was very spacious, clean, and had a good size bathroom with shower over the bath. As soon as we walked in the room you could feel the air-conditioning working. There was also a portable unit in the room so sleeping was easy even in the extreme temperatures! The hotel is very close to Hyde Park on a quiet part of the street with no noise at night. Staff were not overly friendly and some of them did not understand English very well. The breakfast was basic - croissants (stale on day 2!), bread rolls, 2 choices of cereal and toast with jam or marmalade. However, for the price (75 for a double or 89 for a triple) we were pleased with what we got and we will stay here again."
97,924,"Jul 22 2006 	Utterly disappointing	Based on mostly positive reviews (THEN), I booked London Guards for a two-week stay for my daughter and me. Our room was tiny, but having spent much time in Europe, I wasn't terribly disappointed--until a friend came to visit us and spent the night at London Guards in a much nicer room with a real view--as opposed to our room, which was half underground with almost no natural light at all. After the roaches appeared in our room, we were moved to the same room my friend had occupied for the remainder of the visit. (That is, we were told to move but were provided no assistance.) Breakfast was typically bad English, so I had one (instead of 13). The final insult came the day we departed. I asked the desk clerk to order us a cab, but apparently the hotel has a racket going with a private company, so instead of the 7 or so GBP we paid to arrive by cab from Paddington, the private guy charged us 16 GBP. In an attempt to say something nice, I will mention that the air conditioning worked well, and there is an ice machine in the building. The staff, none of whom we encontered in two weeks, was a native speaker of any of the world's Englishes, varied from helpful to terribly rude."
98,924,"Jul 21 2006	Good value for families	Actually woried about this hotel - it was the only one I could find that had rooms for a family of five - yet I needn't have, it was good value, clean and in a good, quiet, location. The area is safe with large expensive houses surrounding, it is just over the road from Hyde Park and lots of good places to eat (mostly Italian) nearby. The man on reception was helpful but the breakfast wasn't worth bothering about - better to eat out nearby. It says it is close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate tubes - Lancaster Gate isn't far but Paddington is quite a hike. The room was clean, the bathroom adequate and although there were five of us, it didn't feel overcrowded and there was air conditioning. Would definitely stay here again if taking the kids to London."
99,924,"Jul 16 2006	London Guards Hotel: a big disappointment...	This is a three-star hotel, but aside from the air-conditioning and the strong shower, I'm not sure how it got rated so high. We stayed in our first room for two nights, until we found ants crawling on the suitcase. They did a laundry for us, for free, and then switched us to another room, because I insisted. They tried to give us an even smaller room, putting a cot in for my nephew, but I refused. We were finallly given a nicer room. This room had bugs in the bathroom--only two, but still...Continental breakfast was included and it was bad. Tasteless white bread and rolls, hard little crossants, and, according to my nephew, stale dry cereal. No fruit, yogurt or cheese. We couldn't find anywhere else close to have breakfast and no one on the staff had a recommendation.Pillows were small, flat, and lumpy; sheets and towels were coarse.The staff was nice, but not particularly knowledgeable. Practically no one could tell us what bus to take, etc.There was supposed to be a computer hookup in the room which I had e-mailed them about. Despite e-mails back and forth about it, no one mentioned the special type of adapter we'd need. We had brought appropriate adapters with us, but they didn't work. There's a computer in the lobby that there's a charge for. It is incredibly incredibly slow."
100,924,"Jul 14 2006	Don't go!	After reading numerous reviews of dozens of budget hotels in London, I chose this hotel over another I'd stayed at in the Bayswater area several years ago. Big mistake as we'd booked 7 nights based on the positive reviews. The hotel charged our credit card upon arrival which is likely the first sign something is wrong.Positive remarks: Our bathroom and room were thoroughly cleaned every day. Nice size fridge in the room. It is near a tube station and close to Hyde Park. The hairdryer was located beside a dressing table, a big plus for women!Negative remarks: The hotel is old and tired. Lumpy bed. We didn't have any easy chairs to relax in after a long days of sightseeing. The breakfast is as bad as everyone describes it. We went twice in 7 days. The hotel is not as close to the main Bayswater shopping and restaurant district as many others.We paid 75 pounds per night, which was considerably more than the nightly rate at another budget hotel in the Baywater area I'd previously stayed in, so I expected a higher standard. Wrong! It was a poorer. Warning---don't go!"
101,924,"Jul 8 2006	Great value London Hotel	With hotels in London being so expensive we thought this one was a real bargain. We were very surprised to get such a very large room which had 2 double beds. The room was very clean and also had a refrigerator and air conditioner. We arrived early one morning from a flight from Sydney and they did not give us an early check in which was a bit disappointing. The night clerk could also do with some lessons in customer service, but the day staff were a lot friendlier. The breakfast room is in the basement and was very poor - they served us stale croissants and most of the crockery was we ate from was chipped (including the coffee cups!). The location was quite good as well, close to the tube though you still do have to walk a bit to get there. The hotel is a bit out of the way from the action but overall we would definately go back to this hotel."
102,924,"Jul 7 2006	Pretty Average	We were two families with small children traveling together. I must concur the London Guards is in a convenient location and the price is great for London. I wish my review could be glowing, but it's not. The hotel is a bit quirky. The rooms are kind of funky (some have stairs in them), fairly clean, and the breakfast is second-rate for London--if you want a proper English breakfast, don't stay here! We went during a heat wave and getting air conditioning was a big selling point for us. However, our A/C was not working properly. I told the person at the front desk about it and was told they'd take a look at it. Three days and three requests later, there was no change. The people at the front desk were always pleasant but helpfulness was not in their repretoire. We often asked for information about good nearby restaurants, or sightseeing information and were told, &quot;I don't really know.&quot; Gee, thanks. We've stayed in many B &amp; B's in London and on the continent and we know what to expect. This hotel was a disappointment. We will stay elsewhere next time."
103,924,"Jul 6 2006	More bad than good	My husband and I recently spent seven weeks driving around Britain, staying in farmhouse B&amp;B's, averaging 25-30 GBP pppn. Some were small, some were old, but they all were clean, friendly and had pretty good breakfasts. We're not too fussy, and definitely not &quot;five star hotel&quot; folks! That said, we spent three nights at the London Guards Hotel. I chose it after extensive research, based on the following criteria in order of importance: quiet, small, inexpensive, near a tube station, with 70% or better good reviews from Trip Advisor readers. As with many places in a large city, there are good points and bad points about this hotel.The good points: We had a room on the top floor at the back, and it was really, really quiet! The room was very generously sized, adequately clean, although not spotless, and had a portable fan. There was a large refrigerator, which was very handy, since there are several inexpensive take-away places within a few blocks, as well as a couple of pubs. It is an honest 8 minute walk from Lancaster Gate station. The towels were good, there was lots of hot water and water pressure, and a hair dryer. The lift was small and slow, but worked fine and was handy for carrying luggage. The receptionist was efficient, although not overly friendly.The bad points: The hotel is quite run down around the edges, such as peeling paint, etc. The first morning we did not get room service at all, and had to request it the other two mornings. The windows only open about 2&quot;, which was bothersome, as the afternoons were warm. There was an air conditioner, but after listening to a few minutes of it wheezing, and smelling the stale cigarette smoke coming from it, we gave up. (We had requested a non-smoking room, but did not get one.) But the worst point -- by far-- was the &quot;breakfast&quot;. We went down into the basement room which was positively vile smelling -- old, old stale smokey smell in the very walls and floor! My tea was fine, but my husband's coffee was thick, stale and so strong he couldn't drink it. The breakfast fare consisted of cold rolls, cold croissant, one kind of cold cereal, cold butter, milk and orange juice. A cooked breakfast was available for 9 GBP each ($16 USD each), but after seeing the &quot;Continental breakfast&quot;, we didn't want to waste our money. Needless to say, the next two mornings we didn't even bother to go downstairs, as we could not take the smell of the room.At 75 GBP per night for the room, we were not terribly unhappy (other than the breakfast), but next time will certainly stay at another hotel."
104,924,"Jul 2 2006	Great hotel great price!	My wife and I settled on the London Guards after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, and we were not disappointed. We stayed there with our two kids (ages 4 and 1) for three nights, June 2-4, 2006. We knew it a &quot;budget&quot; hotel going in, so we didn't expect anything too fancy. With that expectation going in, we were quite impressed with the hotel.We had a triple room, two double beds and one single. I think it was room 206. Out the back window we could see a cobblestone alleyway, and out the front we had a great view of a building called the Spire House, a beautiful building with, you guessed it, a huge spire. It resembles a medieval church. The room was VERY spacious, like a small apartment almost. It smelled fine (my wife has a very picky nose!), and looked good. Housekeeping was excellent, we had fresh towels and a spotless room every day.The hotel is on a very quiet street, mainly a business/hotel area, just a few blocks from Hyde Park. The Lancaster Gate tube is a 5-10 minute walk (I highly recommend the tube for travel), as are numerous ATM machines. A nice shopping area (Bayswater) is also about a ten minute walk, good for last minute souvenirs. Internet access is available in the lobby, for a nominal price.The staff was always very friendly and helpful, never seeming &quot;put out&quot; at all with any of the numerous questions one asks when one has two small children! They held our luggage in the lobby on the day we checked out for an extra three hours, while we finished up our sightseeing. They offered to do it even before we asked. And a few weeks after our stay we even got a letter from them, thanking us for our stay!The only less than perfect aspect, as noted in other reviews, is the sparse breakfast, but since we don't eat a big breakfast anyway we didn't care. Hot food is also available for a fair price.Highly recommended for the non-fancy traveler."
105,924,"Jun 23 2006	old hotel	the small lift was utterly pointless as it took forever; room was large (two king/queen beds and one twin bed), but the beds were so old that my partner and i awoke in a sinkhole in the middle...the bedding seemed to be equally old and worn; chairs were quite stained; pay internet machine in the lobby"
106,924,"Jun 19 2006	Sweet and simple	We stayed at this hotel for four nights during the month of June 2006. On arrival, the hotel was a bit difficult to find. As marked on the map, it appears that lancaster gate is opposite the hotel, but this isnt the case. Lancaster gate is about 300meters from the hotel, which is quite a walk if you have luggage and dont know where it is. We had a double room on the 1st floor which was fairly large. The room had a fan and an aircon that worked perfectly as we had experience extremely hot weather whilst in london. The bathroom was large and more importantly it was clean. Our rooms and bathroom were cleaned daily. The hotel also allowed us an early check in which we were emmensely grateful for as we needed to freshen up after such a long flight. Also on the occassion that we needed an adaptor, we were provided with one quite promptly. (for a fee ofcourse)Breakfast was standard and included cereals, toast, juice and croussants. If you wanted anything else, you could order off the menu, which i thought was rather expensive.The staff at the breakfast room were friendly, however i the desk clerk needs a few lessons in service. Overall, i think i got what i paid for, given the high prices of hotels in london. We were there on holiday and spent very little time in the room, so it was perfect. Althought 300meters away, lancaster gate is quite convenient. There are also loads of restuarants in the area. If you would like to picnic or take a stroll, hyde park is close by. The neighbourhood is also quiet, so its a good place to getaway from the noise and buzz of london city."
107,924,"Jun 16 2006	Worn out but clean.....	I just returned from London. I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights... The hotel is worn out especially in the loby. The furniture in the rooms are also a little bit old. However, the rooms are clean and not small . There is a small refregirator in every room. The bathroom was also quite big and clean.I booked to hotel from internet and it is rather cheap according to London prices. There suppose to be an airconditioner in every room. However, ours was not working. It is was very hot during our stay. So, we reported it several times. But it was never fixed. When we wanted to change our room due to this problem, they told us that the hotel is completely booked. However, they promised to grant us a fine. Guess what? We never got it!The biggest problem in the hotel is that, It is difficult to find somebody that speaks fluent English and also that can help. The staff is friendly but that is all. Will I stay here again? No way!"
108,924,"Jun 5 2006	large room pleasant stay	Stayed 1 night while working in Hyde Park, booked a single room but got a twin which was fairly large with loads of room. The room/hotel could use a lick of paint and a bit of updating bu apart from that was a pleasant stay.10 minute walk to nearest tube or 15-20 minute walk to Marble Arch."
109,924,"Jun 3 2006	Good price for London	London is an expensive city; finding this hotel near Hyde Park that could hold 5 people for a reasonable price was a plus. The hotel is older and certainly not the Omni, but the price and location for 5 people is unmatched."
110,924,"Apr 23 2006	Quite Basic but good location	The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk from Lancaster Gate tube station and is in a quiet area.We booked a double room through LastMinute and only paid 69, I would definitely not pay anymore for this room.The room itself was very basic and very old fashioned. Although the size of the room was excellent, very large by London standards. The bedding wasn't really up to much, our bedspread was quickly discarded as we found a brownish stain on it . And underneath we had a brown fleece blanket and a sheet. Not really what we expected.The bathroom consisted of a toilet, basin and shower. The shower was a bit tempremental and sometimes it shot out boiling water which resulted in me getting burnt!The breakfast was okay - we had the continental, there was a choice of fruit juices, tea, coffee and to eat , croissants, bread rolls and cereal.I have stayed in three hotels in Lancaster Gate - and I would definitely consider the others before booking here again."
111,924,"Apr 17 2006	Great value	We - a family of five - stayed here for three nights and got a very large and quiet room on the third floor. The location is good but a bit boring, as this area is dominated by hotels. The walk to Lancaster Gate tube-station is only ten minutes (It will be closed this summer, but I think Queensway is nearly as close.), but the restaurants and cafs were a bit harder to find. However, when we found them, they were good, and even our youngest daughter (6) was content.The best thing about this hotel is the service - the receptionists were extremely helpful. The worst thing is the breakfast. Croissants, spongy breadrolls, cereals, (toast on request), juice, tea or coffee is what you get, if you don't want to pay - rather a lot - for the English breakfast. However, this is England, as far as I know it and I would recommend this hotel."
112,924,"Apr 3 2006	Wonderful stay A++++++	I stayed here with my husband and sister for 8 days. I read the reviews before we booked and it was as everyone said. This is an older building, the rooms looked alittle worn. But they were a good size and the bathroom was very large. The staff was very helpful and it was a great location!!!! For an inexpensive hotel it works great. I will defifinitly stay again. Can't beat the price!"
113,924,"Mar 26 2006	Great Experience!	To find a large enough room to sleep a family of 5 comfortably was a blessing! Particularly in such a nice hotel! We enjoyed the location very well. Being right on Hyde Park allowed us to feed the pigeons daily, walk the park and see everyday Londoners and their dogs, and walk to Kensington Palace and the Orangery (highly recommended). Multiple restaurants were nearby. Pickup spots for our tours were around the corner. Hotel service was great, free breakfast, and location! The price? Average for the area, but remember everything in London is expensive."
114,924,"Mar 12 2006	Wonderful Hotel	Coming from Canada, in a group of three (two kids, 13 and 17 and one adult), we were reccomended this hotel as an alternative to another one in the area that had had some negative reviews from a family friend. We were given a room on the second floor with a wonderful view of Hyde Park, and although it was small compared to other rooms in the hotel, it was very cozy and served our needs to a tee. The beds were very comfortable, bathroom in good condition and the small fridge became very handy. It was also nice having a teapot, cups and a container to boil water in, as we ended up buying a large amount of tea in London during the trip! The hotel is in good condition, although the wallpaper in our room was pretty gaudy. On our first day, suffering greatly from jet lag, it was wonderful to stroll in the park, barely a minute away, and it was found later in the evening that there are some nice restaurants in the nearby area. The neighbourhood and hotel itself was relatively quiet during the night, so we slept very well during the whole stay (five nights). I'd say that the best feature of the hotel was the superior service, whether at the front desk or at breakfast. Housekeeping was especially wonderful with our room- we were pleased to come back to such a clean room with fresh towels on our beds after a long day in the city. Breakfast was the only thing worth complaining about, as it got pretty dull by the last few days- the croissants were excellent, but the daily cornflakes or dry rolls less so. All things considered- a fantastic hotel, especially for the price. It certainly added to the wonderful time we had in the UK."
115,924,"Mar 7 2006	Excellent Value for Money.	We stayed here for 3 nights in November when we went to London for a short break. We were pleasently surprised to find that our room had both a double and single bed and there was plenty of room. The staff were very very friendly. The rooms were very clean and were cleaned each day while we were out. I was afraid of how big the bathroom would be as I had heard not to expect anything much in London, but it was a fine size and had a really good shower in it. There was always hot water. The breakfast was the worst bit. The cornflakes were very soggy and the rolls weren't great either but then again we were out and about site seeing early so we just ate while we were out it suited us better. When we got home we got a letter from the hotel to thank us for our visit. It is a cheap and cheerful hotel and centrally located for everything. We will be staying here again if we go back to London."
116,924,"Jan 18 2006	All around good value for London	We stayed at the London Guards Hotel in January 2006, and I have to agree with the reviews that are posted on this site. All around, this hotel provided an excellent value for its price. It's clean, comfortable and in a safe and quiet neighborhood. It is also easy to get anywhere in the city from the hotel by using public transportation. It is definitely a little threadbare but if you're looking for good budget accomodations, this is it. The breakfast was a little sparse, so be warned if you are expecting a big spread. There are two kinds of cereal, croissants and bread rolls. Coffee, tea, juices and jams. That's it. Don't expect anything more.I used the reviews on Trip Advisor to help me find this hotel and was quite satisfied. There were no surprises. And that made me happy!"
117,924,"Jan 12 2006	Great Hotel great location	I stayed at the London Guards last summer for 2 nights with my 3 sons. Our room was rather large, given London standards, with 2 king and 1 queen size bed. Price was reasonable - ~300$/night via Expedia. This would have been a big room even by american standards. The bath was very clean, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful with tour advices, public transportation etc.Location was convenient, close to Hyde Park. While you can't really walk to any of the big attractions, you can get there easily with public transportation. The neighborhood felt very safe, even at night. Case in point: as my sons pointed out lots of nice expensive cars parked on the street!"
118,924,"Jan 11 2006	Great location I'd stay again	London Guards Hotel was a great value for the money. The hotel is older, small, on a nice quiet cul-de-sac just north of Hyde Park--you can see the park from the front door. The location could not be better--5 minutes to Lancaster Gate Tube, 7 minutes to Queensway, 9 to Bayswater, 12 to Paddington. Very well lit, safe, high rent area. (Newly renovated 3 bedroom flat next door was listed at 1.7 million GBP) Our room was large by London standards, clean and comfortable. The TV was tiny with very limited channels, but I'm not in London to watch television! The bathroom was decent size with plenty of hot water, clean tile, not funky. The only real complaint I have is the shower curtain was mildewy at the bottom and smelled mildewy when you ran the water. There was a towel heater in the bathroom. The staff was friendly and very accomodating, although I'm not a difficult or demanding guest so I cannot tell you how they would react to requests above and beyond what was provided. Not beautifully decorated and in fact the wallpaper, Queen Anne style chairs, bachelor pad couches and wooden parquet floors and chandeliers were a bit incongruous in their juxtaposition of styles, but, again, it doesn't matter to me if it's clean, well-located and safe. I'd stay here again any time. If you walk toward the Bayswater tube station, you will find all manner of anything you need--Boots, huge variety of food from American staples (KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, Starbucks) to chippies, pubs, etc. There's also some cheap internet cafes (50p for an hour) as well. If you've ever read the book &quot;The Mouse and the Motorcycle&quot;, the London Guards is the hotel in that book in my imagination. Enjoy!"
119,924,"Dec 23 2005	You get what you pay for. And that's not much	We spent four nights on London Guards Hotel. The booking was easy and paid 240 pounds or so.The room had dirty windows, occasionally working toilet flush switch, an unpleasent and strong airfreshner smell in the bathroom - had they something to hide? The bed was hard, TV had a bad or no signal at all, we saw the receptionist guy seven times, there was two times when he was NOT on the phone talking foreign language, not english.The bottom floor stinked, there had to be some plumbing hazard or something, you couldn't really breathe on the hallways in bottom floor. And the breakfast was served in that floor, luckily that room didn't smell. The plates, cups and forks were dirty on three of the four breakfasts that we had.It was bad, but I guess it's the best you can get with budget like this. On any other place you could have much more. Despite being cheap, I cannot recommend this hotel as there HAS to be something better than this with 60 pound per night, even in London."
120,924,"Dec 6 2005	Excellent Hotel	Full modern shower and bathtub. Plenty of hot water and good water pressure. Clean room and common areas. We stayed 7 nights and staff was always friendly and accommodating. Our double room was adequate size, high ceiling, included a small refrigerator, and a safe. Bathroom was large. The hotel has an elevator. The Lancaster Gate tube station is a five minute walk as is Hyde Park. The neighborhood has an elegant feel to it. If you stay be sure to check out the nearby Archery Tavern at 4 Bathurst Street, it has a real pub atmosphere and great pub food with the landlord/publican on site most of the times we were there. The Swan at 66 Bayswater Road lacks the &quot;real&quot; pub feel but the staff were very warm and welcoming."
121,924,"Dec 1 2005 	Very Good value and would recommend	I visit London on business and pleasure and have previously stayed at many other locations. This hotel is however exceptionally good value. I had a single room which was adequate and if alone who needs a lot of room. The room was warm, dry and quiet. A pre-requisite for business travel. Breakfast was a surprise as to the cost of the &quot;English&quot; breakfast - tinned mushrooms not welcome - otherwise good if not a little pricey. But continental breakfast fine. Staff could have been friendlier. Conclusion - will I stay there again - yes;will I recomend - already have."
122,924,"Oct 31 2005	Best Value	We stayed at the London Guards for 6 nights. Overall, it was a very good experience and I would definitely stay there again. In fact, I would recommend this hotel.The rooms were clean, though not big. The bathroom, which was spotless, did not only have a shower but also a tub. The staff were so helpful. THe best thing of all, the room had a fridge and a safe. Some say the drawback is the breakfast. But, I didn't care. The hotel served only croissant or bread and cereals, plus orange or grapefruit juice and coffee or tea. I didn't choose the hotel for its breakfast. As a matter of fact, other hotels that never showed good reviews cost more and didn't serve breakfast. The location is simply ok. It is a good walk to the tube station, unlike the other hotels that have a station right at its doors or are not far from it. Anyway, the walk to the Bayswater station is good (compared to the nearer Lancaster Gate station) because there are lots of shops and restaurants on the way. For 59/night, I would say that I got great value for my money."
123,924,"Oct 20 2005	Not bad for London!	This is London....so unless you pay mega bucks don't expect anything TOO fancy.For 180 GBP for 3 nights(via Lastminute) we found this to be a pleasant,clean and overall a good standard of hotel.Its proximity is near Lancaster gate tube station and Hyde Park.Our room was on the top floor (4th) and we had no problemw as they had a lift!!!!The only drawback was the Breakfast Buffet!!!If you are a big breakfast eater(All you americans BEWARE!!!!) this may be a shock to the system and you may need an extra breakfast later!!!YOu only get cereal (2 sorts) and Croissants and rolls.Oh yes...you get tea or coffee!!!!Overall its a good,clean,good value for money hotel and the staff were pleasnt too!"
124,924,"Oct 5 2005	Good value clean and spacious rooms.	Stayed at the London Guards for 3 consecutive nights in late september. Double was GBP 65 a night incl. breakfast.The rooms are a bit worn and do not expect to much from the breakfast.Location is good, 5-10 minutes from Lancaster Gate tube station. Quiet neighbourhood. Beds were good too. Our room had a fridge and was clean and rather spacious (!). Having stayed in some rather dodgy, extremely small rooms elswehere in London, I found this to be really good value. Would recommend it.Enjoy London!"
125,924,"Sep 27 2005	Glad we stayed!!	During our recent trip to England, we spent one night at the London Guards Hotel and were not disappointed at all! After being warned by more than one person about the 'tiny hotel rooms in London' we were amazed by the size of our room! There were two beds in the room as well as a full living room area and a good size bathroom. The hotel was clean and the staff friendly. They also helped us out with an early check in on our day of arrival. The breakfast was fine- nothing special but it served its purpose- some cereal and some croissants to keep us going for the morning. The short (5 minutes or so) walk to the tube made it very easy to come and go from the hotel. We have recommended the hotel to others and will definitely think about going back on our next trip to London!"
126,924,"Sep 24 2005	excellent hotel	I decided to stay at 'London Guards Hotel' firstly because it was fairly cheap in comparison with all other London hotels and because I had read such good critics here!Well, it was certainly worth it. Perfect location, very friendly staff and most importantly CLEAN! OUr room was pretty spacious; tv, air-conditioning, boiler, shower/bathroom .. I requested 2nd or 3rd floor as a trip advisor member advised and it was just fine!Breakfast was a bit poor but who really cares? After departure, I even received a letter home thanking for the stay etc etc which was highly appreciated.I recommend it 100%. Oh, do ask them the service to/from the aiport or any other location. It's worth it - not expensive and saves you from a lot of trouble. Don't book a taxi yourselves!!! They offer a very good service for a logical price (if there's any logic in London!!!!!!)Unfortunately, photos are not that clear but you can get an idea!!"
127,924,"Sep 20 2005	A great place to stay	A great place to stay. Our room on the 4th floor was huge, with 3 beds. Very clean bathroom (with big tub), fridge, TV and very quiet at night. Location was excellent, 5 min level walk to Lancaster Gate tube or 10 mins to Paddington Heathrow Express terminal. Continental breakfast was fine. I would stay again."
128,924,"Sep 18 2005 	Satisfied	This is a satisfactory place to stay, for a decent price. Our room was nicely decorated, although it seems like its been a while since the last overhall-- there was some peeling wallpaper in the corners etc. The room and bathroom were very clean though, which is the most important thing. The bed was comfortable, and having the fridge in the room was very useful.The service is no-frills-- not bad at all, but no extras. The continental breakfast was very average. I tried the full English breakfast one morning, (costs extra), but it wasn't so great. If you stay here and like a big breakfast, go for the ham and cheese omelette instead.Overall, satisifactry, especially if you're on a budget."
129,924,"Aug 11 2005	Good Hotel Nice location	After reading the reviews for London Guards Hotel in this site, I booked a room in it. I was not disappointed.- Nice location: 5 min walking from Lancaster Gate Underground station. Very quiet neighbourhood.- Good value for money: we did get a very good price on the internet for one night only, from Saturday to Sunday. - Clean &amp; spacious rooms.: as advised in one of the reviews, we asked for a room in the upper floors when making the booking. We were given a room in the 4th floor. Very quiet apart from a continuous buzz coming from the air conditioning engine on the roof of the building.(although it did not matter to me at all).- I was surprised by the nice fridge in the room. There is also a kettle, a TV, a hair dryer. The bath room was spacious and very clean. Towels and shower gel were provided.- Nice continental breakfast: tea/coffee, croissants and bread, jam &amp; cereals, orange juice.Tip: Make your booking through a London hotels website and get the unofficial price: youll save money and then the hotel will really be good value for the price.Ask for a room in the upper floors: maybe not on the 4th floor if you want to avoid the very light buzz coming from the roof .I will definitely come back to London Guards Hotel for my next visit in London."
130,924,"Aug 8 2005	Great location/value	This was a good, clean hotel, I was very pleased for the price I paid (via lastminute) It has the high ceilings that so many have mentioned, and it is more like staying in a london home that has been converted than a hotel. It was clean, looked good from outside and in, in a quiet location behind a church ( you can see hyde park, it is about a block in front) the receptionists were very nice and helpful. Breakfast was a nice affair, crosaints, toast, juices, cereals, etc. Full English costs more, didn't have that, continental was enough (It is basically all you can eat!) Right, now for you AMERICANS :::: (I can say this because I am American living in England) This is what you may not like. It is about a 5 minute walk (YES WALK) from Lancaster Gate Tube station. About the equivalent of 3 blocks. Nice, clean, safe streets though! This is a great location if you don't mind taking the tube everywhere. It is in Zone 1, so very central. Our room had an adequate double (Probably smaller than what yanks are used to ) and a single bed as well. (Even though only two of us in room. ) I remember an American mentioning the towels were small. I found them very adequate, clean, white, etc, they fit me ok. (Size 12 UK, I think 10 US? ) CAble is good, TV works, kettle, etc, I could find no fault with this and the price we paid (59) we were very happy."
131,924,"Jul 25 2005	Nice Room Pleasant Staff Great Location 	This is a small Botique Hotel on the edge of Hyde Park between Bayswater and Notting Hill. This was the only 3-star hotel we could find that offered large rooms (we are a family of 5) and airconditioning at a reasonable price. The hotel is old-world and charming. While it does not come across as a new Hilton or Marriot, it does come across as authentic and British. Beautiful old world crown molding in the lobby and corridor, internet access from the lobby, basc breakfast an interesting bar and a friendly staff. The location was excellent: Nice neighborhood, centrally located and near the tube. I stay in London all the time for business and pay much higherprices for hotels that do not in any significant way outshine the London Guard. Nice place to sleep while visiting London... Save your money for the city.. you'll need it !"
132,924,Jun 22 2005	a nice hotel	We got what we expected. friendly staff. nice triple room. AC was o.k. breakfast a bit poor but fair. the area was quiet and very near the beautiful Hyde Park and the Tube.
133,924,"Jun 22 2005	Ask for rooms on upper floor	I stayed at the London Guards Hotel in June and on the first night was assigned a room that was depressing, dark, dant and musty. The beds were terrible in terms of large divets and depressions in the middle causing one to either roll to the side or sink in the middle. I asked for a different room the second day and was given a room that was so wonderful in contrast. This room had high 15 foot corniced ceilings, large windows, flowered wallpaper, smelled lovely and the beds were firm and level. What a difference!!! I couldn't ask for a better room, so be sure to ask for an upper level room and not one in the basement or ground level."
134,924,"Jun 13 2005	Good hotel good Price!!	We recently stayed 3 nigths at the London Guards Hotel. It was 4 adults in a Family room. I have been to London before and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the rooms. The rooms were big for London standards, with refrigerators to keep beverages and snacks which is very handy. The bathroom was a very good size and the tub was quite nice. Water pressure was excellent and there was plenty of hot water. Continental breakfast is included. Location is great. The tube and the bus are 1 1/2 to 2 blocks away. Hyde park is also about a 4 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly. They helped us to book some tours which was great. For anyone with a car, there is a carpark not too far from the hotel and they offer discounted rates to guests of the hotel. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. I would definitely come back to this hotel and highly recommend it. It is not a 5 star but it is a good hotel at a good price."
135,924,"Jun 1 2005	Spacious London hotel	We just returned from our stay in England which included two nights in London at the London Guards Hotel. We were very pleased with this hotel. We had a quad room (2 adults/2 kids) and it was very large, even by American standards, with high ceilings and huge windows which added to the spacious feel. We had two double beds and a single off to the side which gave our teenager a tiny bit more privacy than you would expect in a shared room. With an electric tea kettle and fridge, we were able to have a nice snack time in the room. The bathroom was sizable with very good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Windows in the room and bathroom opened for a nice breeze. The staff was friendly and competent, but not particularly bubbly. I would add that in addition to the included breakfast you can order a more full breakfast -- we found that for 3 pounds (approx. $5.50) you could get one order of eggs and bacon which was large enough to supplement our family's breakfast (a piece of bacon [very good bacon] each, and a bit of scrambled eggs). Everything was clean and neat, but not fancy. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
136,924,"May 23 2005	Pleasantly surprised	After reading several reviews of the London Guards and other London hotels, I was expecting to be jammed in the equivalent of a storage closet. The London Gurards Hotel was a pleasant surprise. First, the location is great. Within a few blocks radius you have the Lancaster Gate tube station, a bus stop, a cash machine at the Shell station, a fairly good shopping district and a relaxing walk through Kensington Gardens. The hotel is located a couple of blocks off busy Bayswater Road, so it is pretty quiet. While the room is not huge, nor is it fancy. It was clean and large enough for the 3 of us to move around pretty well for the 5 nights we were there. In fact, it was larger than some of the motels we havestayed in here in &quot;The States&quot;. We had requested a room with 3 single beds, and we got it. The bathroom was &quot;functional&quot;, nothing special. The shower had plenty of water pressure and hot water. One negtive was theair conditioning. It wasn't working the first night, but the staff checked into it and got it working. However, it wasn't working again the second night. It was on the third day that we were told that they turn it off at 10:00 PM due to the noise. Thankfully, the tempratures at night were cool, the windows opened and the room had a fan. The continental breakfast, which was included with the room, was small, but tasty, cereal, breads, juice, coffee or tea. The staff was polite and courteous and seemed happy to help when we needed assistance. I don't know when or if we will visit London again, but if we do, the London Guards Hotel would definitely deserve consideration for our accomodations."
137,924,"Mar 24 2005	OK	For London, where everything tends to be expensive, this hotel is a good value if you get a reduced rate by booking though a third-party website.The only problem: after making a reservation for a twin room, we were given a room with a double bed (big enough for only one person), a sofa bed (with no linens), and a roll-away cot (only big enough for a child). We requested a room change for the second night and had a much better room."
138,924,"Feb 27 2005	A Gem	I stayed four nights in February, 2005. Anyone who complains about the London Guards Hotel has not stayed at many London budget hotels. This is a gem. On check in, I was first taken to a ground floor room, but my research had told me these tended to be noisy. I mentioned this, and I was given a room on the first floor overlooking Lancaster Gate. Cleanliness was excellent. Bathroom was large enough, clean, and functional. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was entirely bread and corn flakes-type cereal, but with a refrigerator in the room, I simply did a little shopping and had some great meals in the room. This will be the first place I check when I return to London."
139,924,"Feb 21 2005	Guards Hotel	I Stayed here with my girlfriend for 4 nights during mid Feb. I found the hotel to be better then average and very good value. Although if you do want to stay in this hotel I do suggest shopping around on the websites for the best deal - as its about 130 a night for a double room when you are there, I paid 160 for four nights on one website but you could have paid up to 400 for the same duration.The rooms are big for London, and had a nice fridge and all the things you expect. Reception were always helpful but never bugged you. The hotel was very clean, and room-service would clean your room when you wanted it to be at pretty much any time during there day (till 5pm).The hotel is located in a leafy bit of Lancaster Gate and about 5 - 7 mins from the tube, which is, pretty much perfects. There is also a local store, which sells odd bits you might need (but not newspapers!)All in all this is the best budget London hotel I have stayed in, next time Im in the city i will stay here. One minus point though, like so many hotels in London you have to leave your key at reception when you go out - they say its for security, never been to keen on this idea but thats just the way it is."
140,924,Feb 20 2005	What a dump	We stayed there in July 2004 and found it dingy and run down. Indifferent staff. I would not recommend it.
141,924,"Feb 18 2005	Great value for the price	Me and my wife stayed three nights in London Guards lately. We get an excellent price through ----------- when booking about a month beforehand (less than third of the rack price). Must say that hotel was great value for the price we paid.The room was clean and comfortable, thus the double bed was not stardard wide but it didn't bother us since we like to sleep close to each other...Breakfast was not very hearty but as we already know about what to expect (thanks to other reviews on this site) it was OK.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't want or need five star luxury but a cheap, comfortable and clean room quite near the center of London with good public transport connections."
142,924,"Jan 14 2005	Good room good location good price. Simply good.	Me and my girlfriend stayed at the London Guard for three knights and where very pleased with our stay there.The rooms were clean and so was the bathroom (taken in mind that this isnt a totally new building and its not Hilton). Our room looked very much as the rooms in the photos displayed on there page.The last time I visited London I stayed in a much more expensive hotel and it was horrible. So I wasnt sure what to expect from a hotel for this price.Its not super fancy but it suites people who want a nice, clean, cheep hotel close to the city centre. I would strongly recommend the hotel to anyone travelling to London."
143,924,"Jan 7 2005	Nice hotel great location good price	I was worried about staying at this hotel, since I had a bad experience with another privately-owned townhouse converted to hotel. But I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is located just three blocks from Lancaster gate tube near the north-central part of Hyde Park. It is also with in walking distance of Paddington Station. They have a lift (elevator). The room was very spacious with a desk, wardrobe, safe, refrigerator and tea kettle. The bath was clean and had a nice large tub and shower (and even a medicine cabinet and a hairdryer). Only continential breakfast is included. I couldn't have been happier for the price we apid was the cheapest in our 3 week stay and one of the better budget hotels i have stayed at anywhere. I would suggest booking your own taxis as they hired an unmetered private car that tried to overcharge me and was a very poor driver that ran red lights."
144,924,"Nov 7 2004	Good location funny bathroom smell	the outside and lobby are very pretty. There is a PC in the lobby that provides very cheap Internet access to check your emails. It is in a good and safe location, right by a tube stop and the park. I thought the room was a typical (small bed/bathroom) European 3 star. We had an interesting 2-story, 2 room, 2 bed room even though we only needed one bed. The bathroom and towels had a very funky smell. My husband did not like it, but I thought it was worth what we paid for the location and quality. A little &quot;secret&quot; - there is a very surreal Russian-run bar down in the basement. You have to check this out."
145,924,"Sep 25 2004	Very smelly	Rooms smelled of filthy cigarette smoke. When asked for a non smoking room was told that I was in it! Room was lovely and street was very quiet. Great location, but smelly room made it difficult to sleep."
146,924,"Aug 30 2004	Great Value	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We had a last minute booking for a twin room and ended up with a family room - plenty of space to spread out! It was perfectly situated for seeing the sights. Also the breakfast seemed perfectly adequate to us and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Only small niggle was the plumbing. The shower was rather antiquated and when running a bath one morning, the cold water came out of the bath tap and the hot out of the shower! For the price we paid it was great value - if you want luxury pay luxury prices! This is an old building not a modern &quot;box&quot;. We would happily go back"
147,924,"Aug 24 2004	excellent value	Just returned from two night stay. Hotel very clean, staff pleasant, triple room very spacious. The area although a few minutes out of london was very pleasant and close to tube. We found two nice pubs for food and drinks and two nice restaurants. Minus point bar/restaurant closed in hotel, but I would return and recommend the hotel."
148,924,Aug 20 2004	A good place to stay	Enjoyed very much our stay in airconditioned well equiped ensuite room for bargain price. The breakfest was not as good - for extras you should pay.
149,924,"Aug 18 2004	great value	We stayed at the London Guards hotel for two weeks in August, 2004. We were thrilled with our large, clean, air-conditioned room. The hot water ran out a couple of times and once the maid made an executive decision about what was &quot;rubbish,&quot; and needed to be thrown away...but otherwise our visit was stress-free and very pleasant. The (included) continental breakfast is orange and/or grapefruit juice; dry cereal ; toast, croissants and rolls; coffee or tea. One could order off the menu (an expensive option) if one needed a more substantial start to the day. Since there are refrigerators in the rooms, you could have a handy stash of yogurt and other snacks. This was my 10th trip to London and I have never returned to a hotel (including a Hilton and a Sheraton), but I would definitely return to the London Guards......I think it is an excellent value. The location is convenient to shopping, restaurants, and public transportation. If you like to walk, it is literally steps from beautiful Hyde Park."
150,924,"Jun 18 2004	great staff	The staff was terrific..solved the A/C problems, set up a private car back to the airport for us, helped with directions and places to change money. I would stay there again. Also good location..near Hyde Park and tube stations."
151,924,"Jun 15 2004	The place has a lot of potential.	We stayed at the London Guards in June, 2004. First the positive - the maids did a great job keeping our room clean. The sheets, floor and bathroom was always clean. The room was also very quiet. Unfortunately, it appears that repairs are not a high priority. I.E., the ice-maker was not working during our entire 7 day stay. The shower was held up with duct tape, and the couch in our room was tattered and stained. And finally, upon arrival, we caught the Heathrow Express, then hailed a cab from Paddington Station to our hotel...the cost for the cab was 4 pounds. We asked the concierge to arrange for a cab to take us to Paddington Station to catch the Heathrow Express for our return home. Instead of a cab, they arranged for a &quot;mini-van&quot; to take us to the airport. The van was smaller than the cab and we were charged 13 pounds for the same trip."
152,924,"Apr 12 2004	Love this hotel!	I'm puzzled by the negative reviews I see here. I stayed at the London Guards in December 2003 and found it just wonderful. The rooms were clean and the bathroom was pristine with a great shower. The room itself was HUGE, the ceilings were high and you could lie on the bed and gaze out the window which was particularly nice on rainy mornings. I was on an upper floor and it was quiet and just lovely. The best things are that there is a fridge AND air conditioning but best of all, the bathroom is sort of off by itself, off the entrance to the room (inside the room, of course) but separated from the room by 2 doors. I don't know about you, but I like the privacy this allows. The internet service downstairs is cheap and the staff is very cheerful, even in the wee hours of the morning! The bed was comfy and this hotel has a nice quirkyness about it, full of secret passageways and odd angles. It took me 10 minutes to find my way downstairs the first time I stayed there! lol I love this place and for the money...come on people, let's not be sooo critical. If you want the quality of the Savoy, you can stay at the Savoy."
153,924,"Apr 7 2004	Quality is Slipping	I just returned from a week long stay at the London Guards. This was my third stay at the hotel and I was disappointed with the decline in the overall condition of the facility. The bed coverings were dirty, the rooms were not well cleaned, we ran out of hot water several mornings, the elevator floor was warping, and the wallpaper was peeling off the wall. The staff was very helpful, however, and allowed me to move to a more suitable room when one became available. I love the location and staff of the hotel but am not sure that I will return unless the room rate is extremely favorable!"
154,924,"Mar 11 2004	Unhelpful staff	I was in London with 2 American friends and had to change hotels as the original booked was not good! We went on-line and found this, unfortunately... On arrival, the guy at reception was not at all helpful and then told us that although we had booked a triple room we actually had a double with an extra single bed. One of those situations where you know it will take so long to find another hotel and only a short trip etc etc so we agreed to take it. The room was small but OK -the windows rattled the whole nights - and there was no heating in the very cold bathroom. We only had one key and that nights two of us went to theatre while our friend recovered from her flight. The receptionist was most put out that we asked him to open the door - he thought we should wake her up! Dont go - find another, friendlier hotel!"
155,924,"Mar 2 2004	Saty away	I did not sleep at all, beds way too hard. Rooms tiny. Brakfast is just a lite snack, you are better off at a vending machine. Attraction are way too far. STAY AWAY"

The staff were very helpful. Cleaning was done every day. The location is great, handy to the tube and lots of shops. I think it is excellent value for a central London location."
2,926,Dec 16 2007	Great Place!	Stayed here several nights in early Nov '07; booked through Expedia. Was unsure what to find with the mixed reviews I'd read. Had a wonderful experience; room/bath very clean and bath was tiled with a great shower. Continental breakfast basic but plentiful. Internet access available and quiet at night for sleeping. Staff extremely helpful.Terrific location near Bayswater tube station and Hyde Park. Worth the money for the budget traveler who is spending time touring the area and not planning on spending their time hanging around their hotel room.
3,926,"Aug 13 2006 	Small and Average-good value	I stayed here with two friends for 5 nights. After reading the reviews on this website I was not sure what to expect, only to not be lumbered with a dreaded basement room. Lo and behold when we got there we were lumbered with a basement room, which felt dingy, and dark. Whilst inspecting around the room, I realised the decor was like that of an 80's students flat, which may not bother some people, but not to my taste. The bathroom was extremely small, and I frequenlty hit my elbows whilst trying to manouvre my way around the shower and toilet. However the room, in general, was not too small, as the room was mainly used as a base, and we did not spend much time in there. The 'refridgerator' did not really keep things cold, merely slightly below room temp. The advertised 'hotplates' were not present in the room, or in fact, any cutlery or knives. I took the trek up the stairs, after repeatedly trying the lift (did not work) and asked where they were. This request was met with a cold reponse like he was doing me a favour. Quite indifferent. However for the price, this was a reasonable 'hotel', perfect if you are on a budget. At the end of the day you get what you pay for. One good thing is the close proximity of transport links which were useful."
4,926,"Jun 21 2006	A friendly flexible stay	After reading reviews on tripadvisor, my boyfriend and I got a bargain at the London House apartments at short notice. We wanted a studio flat rather than a hotel for the 2 nights we stayed. Our connecting bus made us arrive even later than expected but the night porter was cheerful and we were checked in quickly.Our room was nice, we knew it would be small, being in the capital-the bathroom was a bit too small-but the main room was big enough for a short stay. The bedding was fine although people are right, the pillows were thin but we just rolled up the extra blanket to plump them up underneath. The view was lovely,we were at the top (luckily fit enough to avoid the little lift on the way up). There is an underground vent nearby but they are everywhere and its something that didn't bother us.Overall we had no problems and enjoyed our stay. I would use it again."
5,926,"Mar 25 2006	Second stay even nicer!	Stayed here for a week in March on my own after having visited last July with my son for two and a half weeks. Single accommodation (with a double bed) was roomy with plenty of built-in cupboards. Sparkling clean bath with a tub and hand-held shower over; plenty of hot water. Heated towel rack a nice bonus. Lovely surprise was a separate kitchen with fridge, microwave, and a two-burner hob. Most of the units do not include burners; ask for number 17 if it is available. The weather was raw, but the two electric heaters made the space toasty warm in a matter of minutes. This place offers value for money in a super location just a few minutes' walk from Paddington."
6,926,"Aug 16 2005 	My home from home...	Most people on here are probably looking for somewhere to stay for between a few nights and a couple of weeks. My stay at the London House has so far lasted nearly 3 years...The facilities are pretty basic, but they do the job. I certainly wouldn't have put up with somewhere unlivable for 3 years. The bed (which in common with a number of rooms has been replaced while I've been there) is comfortable, the shower generates a decent spray of water at a controllable temperature. There's a kitchen area (microwave, sink, worksurface, fridge) and a small dining area. It's all cleaned regularly and to a high standard. The staff are friendly and it's not too expensive - for long term lets they'll arrange discounted rates. There are only three things I would change: it would be nice to have air conditioning during summer, it would be nice to have an armchair (to save having to sit on the bed all the time), and my happiness would be complete if the gardener at the Hempel hotel across the way would stop waking me up with his leaf blower every morning (I tend to sleep until at least 8:30 and with the window open in summer, the noise comes straight in...)I've not had any problems with the location - it's local to 3 tube stations, Paddington, many shops, dozens of restaurants (Queensway is just a short walk) and it's a reasonably quiet residential area. It takes me 20 minutes to get to work in Tottenham Court Road, door to door. It's a bit like having an ensuite room in a shared house, or something like that. I'd happily recommend it to anyone looking for medium to long term accommodation in the area. For shorter stays, to be honest, the fact that it's entirely self-catering would put me off using it for a &quot;holiday&quot; (because I would want to at least have breakfast in a hotel restaurant), but if you intend to eat out every night or are on a budget, it's probably fine.Basically I live 150 miles from London, but work in central London as you can get. The room is booked continuously, on a rolling basis, so I am effectively a &quot;resident&quot; there - a lot of stuff stays there all the time, with just washing, clean clothes, laptop and so forth making the regular trip home for the weekend.In case you're wondering why I don't just rent a flat, there are several reasons: 1st because the client won't commit to more than 3 months in advance (so I can't take out a 6 month tenancy) and 2nd because all the &quot;niggles&quot; like cleaning, linens, etc are just taken care of at the London House instead of having to bring my own vacuum cleaner and TV...During my time there I've been in a number of rooms (in roughly this order):Room 20 (top floor, right hand side of the building) for a couple of weeks initiallyRoom 5 (basement, front of the building) for a week or twoRoom 14 (mirror image of 20) for more than 6 monthsRoom 30 (very top of the building at the front) because they wanted to refurbish room 14back to Room 20 after I discovered room 30 was really too small for me to cope with (I'm 6'2&quot; and 16 stone... not small!)Room 4 (mirror image of 5) because they wanted to refurbish room 20 back to Room 20 after its refurbishment, for well over a year, then I checked out completely over Christmas last year and came back to:Room 7 (basement, back of the building) then quickly back to... Room 20. Which seems to be &quot;my&quot; room at the moment.The only room I really HATED was room 7. I suspect it was the one which the young lady gave the very bad review to - it's at the back of the building in the basement. What got me was the complete lack of natural light, the noise (rumbling from trains, and other visitors clomping down the stairs with suitcases at all hours of the day and night) and the cold damp feeling, although in fairness it wasn't actually mouldy. It was quite big, but otherwise had nothing going for it and after a couple of nights I just insisted on being moved. I've heard it described as the best room in the house, which I think is basically because it's one of the biggest. But I wouldn't go back there. Other than that, the rooms at the very top of the building (like 30) are quite small with sloping ceilings (I kept banging my shins on the edge of the bed, and my head on the angled ceiling) but otherwise OK.All the other rooms I've stayed in have been fine, including the basement rooms at the front of the building.Friends and colleagues have also stayed there - room 17 is particularly nice and one of the few with a hob, and the ones at the back of the ground floor are also quite pleasant. The only other complaint I've heard was from one colleague who thought room 4 was a bit noisy - basically to do with the trains going into Paddington.So there you have it - I've coped with living there 5 days out of 7 for the last 3 years and I reckon it's an OK place to be."
7,926,"Jun 12 2005 	good value friendly staff	I stayed at the London House for 3 weeks while in London on business. My twin studio was a bit small (although probably average-size for London), but was clean and included a small kitchen with a microwave and a fridge, and en-suite toilet and shower. A maid service came once or twice a week with clean bedding, fresh towels, toilet paper, etc. The washer &amp; dryer were available every time I needed to use them.London House has a fantastic location--the neighborhood is quiet, while only a few minutes from central London. Several tube stations, including Paddington and Lancaster Gate, are a short five minute walk away. Kensington Park is right around the corner. Also, I could stock the fridge in my room with food from Tesco or Sainsbury's, both of which are within walking distance.Since London House is more like an apartment building than a hotel, the office closes in the evenings but this never caused any problems for me. The staff is perhaps the best feature of London House. They are friendly but professional, and also very helpful and willing to answer numerous questions.Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at London House and would be happy to stay there again."
8,926,"May 17 2005	a good deal	we had quite a pleasent stay in London house, and i can certainly recommend it for anyone who is looking for basic but good accommodation in central London. The place offers simple but convinient facilities , with the added bonus of a small kitchen which makes the stay quite comfortbale, even though it is far from being a five star hotel - basically for the price we payed i can say we got a very fair deal, especially considering the really excellent location.The room we stayed at was pretty big in comparison to other london rooms we stayed in the past (some in much more expensive places) , this was clean and airy and had a large window facing the back garden and it was very quiet. The beds were pretty good, with a comfortable mattress.The place doesnt work like an ordinary hotel (reception closes in the evening, there is no daily cleaning service, no lobby or breakfast ) its more like an apaertment hotel so whoever is expecting a hotel in the traditional sense can be disspointed- but it advantages like the kitchen, good sized rooms, the very helpful staff and really a great location, allow me to recommend it."
9,926,"Jan 16 2005	Keyword 'small'	My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for a week over New Years 2004/05.This &quot;hotel&quot; really is a collection of studio apartments. Each room has a small kitchen, with a refrigerator, microwave, and a sink, dishes, and a table setting. It has no stove or oven, which limits your cooking options.The beds are cheap and not very comfortable. No top sheet was provided, the pillows are cheap and thinner than a folded over towel. One extra blanket was provided. Linens are changed more frequently than indicated on their website, but not every day. The shower... well it was small, cramped and had its own electric water heater, which limited water flow to a level which we jokingly called &quot;drooling&quot;. Water temperature was user selected, but went through a boiling hot level to get there.The bathroom was small enough that you could wash your hands while still on the toilet, and the sink was so small that the faucet had to be mounted on the side. The location was convenient for travel, but not very &quot;English&quot;. Every building in the area is a hotel or a tourist trap of some sort. Queensway road, which is nearby, has many shops, but is crowded with tourists night and day. Paddington Station is huge, and quite close, with access to many of the key Tube lines. The street is fairly quiet, although there is a Tube ventilation shaft across from the hotel which has some noise. No buses or other large vehicles were in evidence the week we were there. Price was around $106US a day, which for that area of London is not terrible, particularly considering the potential utility of the kitchen. Price does not include electricity usage, which of course is nearly a scam. Make sure to have them check your meter before you check in. We were very conscientious about power usage, and were charged 10 regardless of that. The staff was friendly, but not very accessible, as hours were limited to 9am-5pm at best. Overall, we would be willing to stay there again if the beds were upgraded to something more closely resembling comfortable. Having a kitchen helped to offset the steep price of food in London."
10,926,"Oct 11 2004	3 words for London House: mould smelly damp	This place is a joke. It looks nice on the website, but has nothing to offer. I stayed for 2 nights and was glad to leave. The room I got was down in the cellar. There was no natural light, the view was that of a moist and mouldy wall. (And they told me it was the best room in the house!)The room was smelly and damp. The paint comes off the walls and there was mould and fungus in the kitchen and shower. (mail me for pictures) This place is a total rip-off and with all the mould I consider it a healthrisk staying here."
11,926,"Jul 1 2004	Best deal in one of the nicest areas	We stayed at the london house for 10 days. When we arrived we discovered it was in a nice and safe neighborhood with many similar hotels in the area. The nearest tube stop was either paddington or lancaster gate, both a 5 minute walk away, there were also many grocery and 24hr conveniance stores on craven hill along with a place that sells a full english breakfast for 2.50GBP which is dirt cheap by british prices. Our room was a triple with one queen bed and one twin, there was also a small dining table, microwave, fridge, dishes, tv, airconditioner, and a nice clean bathroom. we paid 47GBP a night which is very cheap for a triple anywhere in london let alone Bayswater. We found our rate online, the advertised price when we arrived was 115GBP per nite for a triple so we got an especially good deal."

1,927,"Ideal for London visit on a budget	Stayed for two nights in late November. Arrived early, room was available so able to check in ahead of advertised time. Room slightly on the small side but perfectly adequate.Breakfast choice limited but what can you reasonably expect for the price.Located close to Bayswater Tube Station. Found location to be a good base for our visit to London. Plenty of resturants and a Tesco Metro nearby."
2,927,"Perfect for connection to Heathrow and the Underground	An overnight stopover to connect with flghts leaving from Heathrow. Easily located to the Underground.Clean, no frills, windows that opened, in a quiet tree filled square. More than adequate when all you need is a bed and shower-you don't travel to spend your time sitting in an hotel room."
3,927,"Nov 17 2009 	Great hotel good location nice price	I just came back from a 5 days stay in London Hotel, my experience was quite nice there, the staff was really friendly, they have a great location near to the Tube of Bayswater, the rooms are clean and fair for the price you pay, they are recently renovated so the rooms are in good shape. the staff was very helpfull and friendly. Would totally stay here again on my next visit to London"
4,927,"Nov 14 2009 	If you like to shower don't stay here	My wife and I stayed at this hotel for one night a couple of weeks ago. The plus points for this hotel is that it is reasonably priced for London, clean and fairly close to a tube station. However be warned that the staff are not very friendly. We had little/no water to shower in the morning. The staff were uninterested and even denied knowledge of the problem despite the fact that, en route to report the problem, I bumped into three different people who had the same issue.Overall I would not recommend this hotel to friends and I would not stay here again. If the hotelier reads these reviews then a few improvements, as listed below make this an improved place to stay. - soundproofing to reduce the noise from slamming doors (this is a big problem) - hand towels in the bathroom - tuning tv stations to their correct preset"
5,927,"Nov 12 2009 	CHEAP FOR LONDON BUT THERE ARE REASONS FOR THIS !	Having booked an advanced double room at a very reasonable price for a London hotel I was looking forward to my visit as the ratings on this site were very positive.However, it would appear that having got such a great rate has its downfalls. We were put into what I can only describe as a box room where the bed alone (smaller than a double it would seem) just about fitted into the room and not much else. The bathroom was small and narrow also. The room was away from all the other rooms between the 24hr reception and the 1st floor on the stairs and as expected we could easily hear what was going on at the reception and guests using the stairs.The building works as previously mentioned started at 8am outside our bedroom window so having a lie in was never going to happen with an angle grinder going off.The location was great near the Circle line and Hyde Park but do take heed of booking any hotel especially this one in advance!!"
6,927,"Nov 10 2009 	Great value	Stayed 3 nights and very happy with this choice. no frillls but very clean, comfy beds adequate bathroom. Excellent location &amp; would stay again.Minor improvements would be full length mirror in room &amp; some hooks for towels etc in bathroom."
7,927,"Nov 5 2009 	Super Hotel	Just came back from an we stayed 4 nights at the London House Hotel in Bayswater - and we had a pleasant stay there!Hotel room ( newly renovated) on 2nd floor:- good size for London with wardrobe, fridge, kettle ( coffee &amp; tea was providedI, hair dryer and safe. Room &amp; bathroom were cleaned daily and every 2nd day new towels. - We were suprised by the bathroom. Quite big - water was hot straight away even at midnight. Check in: Arrived before normal check-in time . Was no problem we had choice to wait (which we did) or could store luggage. Payment had to be done before moving into room.Check-out:- we had to check out by 10.30 but it was no problem to leave luggage in luggage room. We had to tell how many suitcases we have and got a card with amount of suitcases on it. Room was locked and only with the a.m. card you got key to get into this room. Our suitcases had a lock so we were not afraid that some one will take ours.Breakfast: For 3 GBP you cannot expect a lot. But there are so many places around where you can have a full Engl Breakfast.Location:Bayswater &amp; Queensway Underground about 3 and 6 mins away. Perfect and Bayswater is only 3 stops from Marble Arch. We walked there along Hyde Park and it took us 20 min and we reached Oxford street. Notting Hill is only a walk of 15 min away.Staff:- very friendly and helpful. I have asked for a blanket with reservation and we got it 3 mins after we checked in. There are still renovating the place but work doesnt start before 8 oclock which was ok for us. We will def stay at this hotel again!!!!!"
8,927,"Oct 26 2009 	Great Hotel great location !!	We spent 4 nights with our 2 teenage children &amp; it was a really nice hotel. The Hotel has been recently (&amp; still being) re-furbished &amp; was very tastefully decorated with modern furnishings &amp; decor.Our room was plenty big enough for 4 people with heaps of storage &amp; very comfortable (especially the beds, great linen &amp; duvets too!!). The bathroom was spotlessly clean (as was the rest of the Hotel) with a fantastic shower!. Breakfast was basic but fresh &amp; tasty &amp; the breakfast room was light &amp; roomy. The staff were all extremely friendly &amp; helpful. There was a nice lounge with large TV &amp; internet etc to relax in which was good after a long days sightseeing. You could also use the washing machine/dryer which was a bonus too. The location was great, easy walking to Hyde Park, Harrods &amp; many other locations. Overall, London House exceeded our expectations &amp; it was a fantastic start to our holiday."
9,927,"Oct 9 2009 	Small and Noisy	We spent 3 nights in this hotel. The room was tiny and the bathroom barely large enough to sit on the toilet without hitting your knees on the wall. There was construction that was &quot;written in the fine print on the internet&quot;. We didn't think it would be THAT bad but at 7:45am every day the floor to the room shook it was so loud. On top of that, the walls were so thin that the constant noise of people from other rooms and the hallways keep me into the night. When I tried to inquire about a room change, I was dealt with by an extremely rude hotel service desk clerk. This hotel is a hostel with a fine exterior -- perhaps they should charge 20 pounds a night like other hostels. It's not worth more than this."
10,927,"Oct 8 2009 	Great value 	This hotel, although small, was very clean and had everything wee needed. It is less than 2 blocks from 2 tube stations, bus stops, and the Royal Parks. The front desk was extremely helpful, and they even allowed us to use their washing machine when we needed to do some emergency cleaning.I would definitely stay again!"
11,927,"Oct 1 2009 	Wonderful hotel and great value for money!	We've just returned from our stay at the London House Hotel. It was fabulous. The rooms were very clean, and there was hardly any noise, and our room was right on the street. Every day the house keeping service was impeccible, they made our beds restocked everything. The staff were really nice too. On our first day as soon as we got into the rooms they came to check that everything was ok, and if we needed anything. We asked them for extra cups and coffee and they provided them immediately and with a smile. On the last night we also asked for an extra pillow. They gave us 2 not 1 and brought it straight up to our room. It was just perfect. Well done. We will definately be stayng here again!"
12,927,"Sep 18 2009 	Best basic hotel ever	This is the second time I've stayed at the London House Hotel and it was another excellent visit (even better than last year). Don't come looking for luxury. The rooms are small and bare bones -- no pictures, basic furniture. But they are clean and comfortable. The hotel is located a short walk from the Bayswater and Queensway tube stations which will take you anywhere in London. It is just off a street busy with shopping, restaurants and a few pubs. The hotel remains under construction during renovation, but who is staying in London to sleep or sit in a hotel room all day? It really isn't an issue. I got a room at the London House for three nights for $85 a night. Good luck finding a better rate anywhere in London. The breakfast used to be free and it wasn't that good -- just some toast, dry cereal, cheese. They now charge 3 pounds. Better to grab a bite to eat at one of the nearby cafes. Still, London House is an astounding value. It is clean, comfortable and convenient."
13,927,"Sep 1 2009 	Clean friendly and value for money.	Stayed at the hotel for 3 days in Room 314 on the 3rd floor - double room. We payed 144 pounds for 2 nights via Bookings.com and were very impressed with what we received. We arrived an hour earlier than the 2pm check-in and were given a room straight away. Room was comfortable, clean and quiet with a great view of the neighbouring park. The staff were friendly and helpful. There was a flat screen TV in the room as well as kettle for tea and coffee. The room also had a small fridge to keep our drinks and snacks in. The bathroom was clean and the shower fully function - perhaps newly renovated. The room has key card entry security. No complaints whatsoever. Be wary that not all other hotel guests are considerate enough to ensure their doors close quietly! The doors are all on spring hinges and therefore if care is not taken, they are prone to slamming.There is a luggage room where we safely stored our luggage all day on our last day in London.Overall, very impressed. Especially as you are 5 mins walk away from restaurants and Underground train stations."
14,927,"Aug 24 2009 	An Amazing Reasonably-Priced Gem	Not being very familiar with London or the Bayswater area in which the hotel was located, we did get lost. But we encountered some of the most helpful folks in London who graciously helped us find the hotel. Parts of the hotel was under construction. Prior to check-in time, we sat in the lounge waiting for our room to be ready and could hear the noise from the construction. Luckily our room was far away from all the noise. It was one of the newly renovated rooms. There were three of us so each of us had our own bed. The bathroom was clean and tiny (we thought it was cute). Unfortunately our view wasn't so spectacular as there were scaffolding outside due to construction. Though it would have been without the scaffolding. The service was great. In fact, we checked in earlier because we set our clocks incorrectly so we were actually an hour earlier than the current time. The check-in folks were very nice about it. They arranged for us cab service for early the next morning as we needed to take the Eurostar to Paris. The hotel is pretty close to the main road in Bayswater. It's close to a lot of restaurants and stores. We managed to have some decent dinner in the area as well as buy some nice items."
15,927,"Aug 14 2009	Great value for money	My son and I stayed in a twin room with bathroom in this hotel for 12 nights and the only problem we had was the smoke detector going off in our room for no reason in the middle of the night on our last night.The room was a little small but it was clean, newly renovated and the beds were comfortable; all staff we had anything to do with were friendly and helpful; the location is great - close to two tube stations and walking distance to many attractions; the breakfast (although the same every day) was plentiful and nutritious and there was good access to the internet."
16,927,"Aug 12 2009 	Great value	We stayed 3 nights at the London House Hotel and we enjoyed the experience. We were initially impressed by the rooms as they were clean, comfortable and even a little stylish looking. However, when we were woken up each morning by repairmen literally at our windows we realised there was a downside. We had breakfast each morning which was a standard hotel combination but nevertheless still satisfying. Another positive was the washer/dryer access... even if it did take about 40+mins to dry a load!Would stay here again but hopefully no repairs next time!"
17,927,"Aug 11 2009 	Excellent would recommend to anyone on a budget!	We had a really good experience at the London House Hotel. During our stay they were refirbishing the hotel, but that didn't distract us at all. The breakfast was basic, but a free breakfast is better than nothing! The rooms are very nice and clean, although small but who cares! Your in London you shouldn't be in your room!The underground is right around the corner, and it is really easy to get places. The staff we also very nice and helpful, They minded our bags before our flight out at night and were very helful with directions.At the end of the day, London is an extremely expensive place to stay so I would definately recommend staying here. It is in a very nice area, near parks and shopping centers and lots of food! Enjoy!!!"
18,927,"Aug 7 2009 	Well it wasn't exactly unhygenic but...	You get what you pay for with this place. It was tolerable for our last night in England, but honestly you can do better for the money if you try a little harder. Our room was desperate for a paint job (foot prints on the walls). The sheets were cleanish--I am willing to believe they may have been washed, but there was a dead mosquito and the sheets really needed to be bleached. Our bathroom sink was cracked. The toilet had not been thoroughly scrubbed. Breakfast was pathetic: cold toast and Cocoa Puffs. After the breakfasts we'd had elsewhere (at a lower rate!), this was very disappointing indeed.The staff were very nice. At least that part was good."
19,927,"Aug 6 2009 	Unexpectedly Great!!!	I wasn't sure what to expect with this hotel...the price made it seem too good to be true so upon my arrival, I was unexpectedly surprised (and relieved) to find that it was actually a nice hotel!We stayed in a family en-suite room (1 double bed and two singles). The beds were very comfortable and all of the bedding was good quality! The room itself was very large...we had stayed in other family rooms where you couldn't even find floor space for your bags, but this was spacious and had a closet and large dresser. The room also had a flat screen TV and AIR CONDITIONING!!!!The normal check-out time is 10:30a but I was feeling very ill the morning I woke up and asked for a later check-out, the staff was nice enough to extend the time to noon. The only con I found to the hotel were not related to this particular hotel and would have been an issue no matter where I stayed (ie: we had a basement room and therefore we heard everyone walking by).Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good value in London. I would also definitely stay there again myself!"
20,927,"Aug 1 2009 	good value for money	If you need just a place to sleep over in London - LHH is probably the best value for money I've managed to find yet! I've stayed there on several ocassions and was always happy with the room, reception/personnel, cleaniness etc. Don't raise your expectations too high, but you'll get what you pay for. It's not a 5* hotel but it very much meets the basic needs. It was also refurbished in 2008 so all rooms are in quite good condition. Reception also was always very helpful and responsive to our needs. One time we were staying there with 4 friends booking 3 rooms and they kindly offered three adjacent rooms. Next time I was staying there for a night with my partner and then had a separate reservation for the next night for myself, so I was pleased when they said I don't have to check out and check in later on same day and could just leave all my stuff in the room. With nice location close to two tube stations it's perfect for budget city break."
21,927,"Jul 22 2009 	Great Location Decent Price	I stayed with three other friends all of us being students. I found that this hotel was in a great location. It is in the Bayswater area which is a great combination of both residential and restaurants. The Bayswater tube station is a 5 minute walk away. The matresses were a bit hard but I slept very well and there was no noise from outside. The room cam with a TV (which I never tried out) and a private washroom. The shower was a decent size and clean. Breakfast was basic, with: cereal, toast, juice and croissants, but it was enough to fill me up for the day. The staff were very friendly and let us leave our bags in a baggage room and even gave us an extra key. I highly recommend this hotel!"
22,927,"Jul 10 2009 	good location clean but basic	went to london for Wimbledon, just wanted a well located, clean and safe hotel, and this is the case.very good location, near Hyde Park, the subway, nice nightlife, good restaurants.the hotel is an old house remodelated, but basic: no telephone in the room, no chair, the breakfast was basic but ok.considering hotels in london are expensive, this hotel is ok and relatively cheap."
23,927,"Jul 10 2009 	Great Location Relatively inexpensive You get what you pay for.	I stayed for 4 nights at the London House.  - Staff: The little interaction I had with them was always pleasant. - Breakfast: Included, but I didn't partake. - Room: I stayed in a Single Room. When they said it was small, they weren't kidding. I think my single college dorm was a little bigger. I had to shut the bathroom door to get into bed. I had to keep my luggage on the floor and stand it up when not using it to save floor space. The bed was my only real furniture besides a night table that was at the foot of the bed. However, the bed was clean but made-up strangely. I had to adjust the sheets each night. My biggest issues were that the room was in the stairwell landing. Part of my floor was slanted for the stairs underneath and I kept stubbing my toe. I'm jealous of the reviewer who got 6 channels on the tv as I only got 4. I actually enjoyed my back alley view and would pop my head out each evening for fresh air and to check out the pedestrians on the main street that was just up the alley. - Bathroom: Small, but clean. A little hard to manuever in the shower as I'm a big girl.  - Rest of the hotel: Not bad, but the carpets in the halls don't instill a sense of cleanliness. I got the idea that maybe a lot of Febreze was used but not a lot of vacuuming. - Location: EXCELLENT location. Great touristy area. Easy access to the Tube's District/Circle lines and the Central Line. Queensway road has tons of restaurants and touristy souvenir shops. Whiteleys Shopping Center on the corner a block from the hotel has a M&amp;S Simply Food for quick snacks and drinks, a Yo! Sushi, and a very useful EasyInternet Cafe only 1 pound/hour. The Post Office is on the opposite corner from Whiteleys. I stayed in Earl's Court later in my trip and came back to this part of town for things.This is a no frills hotel. If you just want a base of operation/place to sleep this is a decent choice."
24,927,"Jul 9 2009 	Not happy	If you find this hotel with a VERY VERY good rate and you have a VERY VERY tight budget then go for it. Else, try to find a better place to stay!!!Pros: 1. Location 2. Internet access in the lobby - although expensive (0.50 pounds per 15 minutes) it was convenient for late night and emergency access. Cons: 1. Indiferent staff - borderline rude 2. Never changed the towels in the 5 days we stayed there 3. No hand towels were provided 4. The towel used as floor mat in the restroom had serious yellow stains 5. The bedsheets had hairs all over them 6. The shower was clogged - made us feel like we were taking a bath rather than a shower 7. The restroom shelf on top of the sink was never cleaned - water stains all over 8. The glass cups provided were just repositioned in the restroom shelf without providing clean ones - even if it was evident we had used them i.e. orange juice remains... we wonder if our glass cups were even clean to start with 9. The windows kept banging with the wind - good thing we were on the 2nd floor, else we would have had a hard time falling asleep thinking someone was knocking on our window! 10. Choice of only 6 TV channels 11. No clock or alarm in the room"
25,927,"Jul 6 2009 	Good value clean excellent location!	Very nice and clean budget hotel. Large 3-bed room for me and my daughters. Breakfast , small but ok. Nice and helpful staf and excellent location between Noting Hill and Queensway. Many nice multicultural restaurants in neighbourhood and great shops in the mall, Whitleys. Great transportation, Bayswater and Queensway undregroudstations, and local busses on Bayswater road. All in short walkingdistance."
26,927,"Jul 5 2009 	Small but good value for pricey London.	Relatively close to Bayswater train station and Hyde Park, (well the edge of Hyde Park anyway) makes this a really good base to visit London and all its sites.Hotel located in the center of the tourist hub for budget tourists (so there are a lot of souvenir shops, cheap food outlets (compared to London), and ATMS (accepting most international cards) etc. There is a Marks &amp; Spencer supermarket in the shopping centre around the corner (although quite pricey) contains a very good range of fresh food and take away meals, which works out cheaper than eating out.We stayed in a double room in the basement for four nights at the end of May 2009. Room was small, very minimalist. There is a wardrobe which helps a bit, in terms of clearing up space in the room. The bathroom literally fits the shower, basin and toilet. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean, (which to me is all that matters), and the rooms were serviced every day.Breakfast is included, with the usual option of cereals/toasts and croissants/cheese (dont get too excited, it was pretty poor) etc. No fresh fruit, juice is effectively cordial.Despite being quite expensive for what you get, compared to other London hotels it is good value for location and service."
27,927,"Jul 4 2009 	Clean nice location	We stayed in a family room downstairs and the room was very clean. Shower was awesome. Breakfast was on daily which was bread, crossaints, cereals etc... Very close to bayswater station ans short tube ride into the city. Would definitley reccomend you to stay here!!"
28,927,"Jun 28 2009 	Small room but good hotel	2 nights in this hotel. Very minimalist tiny room (twin) no space for luggage in the room but clean and a good bathroom. Beware Payment by credit cards (except UK Debit Cards/Switch) is subject to a surcharge of 3 %.No sound from the others room, simple breakfast but good.We are wake up to the noise of hammers and drills at 8:00 (hard!)But for the price is a good value."
29,927,"Jun 3 2009 	Fantastic location - great value for your money	I stayed at this hotel in Easter week, four people in two rooms. The rooms were nice and tidy, very small bathroom but good enough for our purpose in London. It's five minutes from Bayswater station and a little further from Queensway station, five minutes from Hyde Park which was absolutely wonderful that week. If you feel like walking to Notting Hill and Portobello Road you can do it in 10-15 minutes. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and all in all we were very satisfied with this hotel. The only thing that wasn't very good was the breakfast which was incredibly dull, the breakfast room is in the cellar and not very nice. But I guess you can always just go one of the coffee shops nearby instead of taking your breakfast at the hotel. That's what we did after two days.If you're in London as a tourist, wanting a place where you can sleep nicely, take a bath and easily get around, this is definitely a great hotel for the money and I recommend highly."
30,927,Jun 2 2009 	london house -awhite castle	london house is a very good hotel. it looks like a castle.the rooms are very clean. i was a little unhappy that my room was at a corner of the basement. the hotel is also centrally located.in fact it is one of the best usp.the receptionists are very coordial.
31,927,"May 30 2009 	A nice budget hotel but some things should be changed	We stayed in this nice budget hotel for 4 nights late May 2009. The hotel is certainly worth it's price, the service is nice, the location is excellent, 2 tube stations so near and Queensway just around the corner. The location is very quiet and the renovations didn't disturb us in any way.BUT:We stayed in a twin room and it was a bit too small. The one little table isn't enough,It would be nice to have at least one chair in the room. There should be something in the shower room, where you can hang your clothes. There should be hand towels in the shower room and there should be a shelf for shampoos and soap in the shower. The breakfast should include some vegetables and more varied things for the toast.ANYWAY, we we're quite happy staying in this little hotel. :)"
32,927,"May 26 2009 	Great location at a reasonable price	We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights during S. Valentine's weekend, and we liked it. The neighbourhood was quiet but nice, filled with shops and restaurants and just two steps away from Bayswater and Queensway tube stations. You can easily go by walk to Notting Hill, Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. The room wasn't that big but ok for a couple, indeed clean and simple-styled except for the plasma tv (which I thought was out of place). Breakfast was included (there wasn't a lot of choice other than bread, butter and jams) and was ok too. Reasonable price and great location, we will definitely come back."
33,927,"May 21 2009 	Tiny room tiny bed but excellent value	This budget hotel is just north of Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and Bayswater Road, and we found it a convenient location close to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations (on different lines, quite handy), with Notting Hill in walking distance.The staff is friendly and the place is clean &amp; safe. There is renovation underway but it didn't bother us.The room was tiny but had a spotlessly clean bathroom. The bed was even smaller, not really big enough for two, and we are quite small. We had a room on the first floor at the rear of the hotel, and had no noise problems.Breakfast is very basic: toast, bland mini-croissant, jam, cheese, cereal, tea and (bad) coffee. Better to grab a bite to eat on Queensway Road.Still, for the GBP60 per night for a double this was an excellent place to stay."
34,927,"May 16 2009 	A very good choice!!	I stayed 7 days there and everything was great.Nice room(not so big), very clean, nice bathroom.All people there were polite and helpful."
35,927,"May 10 2009 	Great Hotel!	I just arrived home from a trip to London yesterday afternoon, after spending seven (7) nights at the London House Hotel. I was a bit leery of staying here after some of the more negative reviews; but, I was pleasantly surprised! The hotel is modest, but offers all that a traveler needs.The BreakfastThe spread of food in the free breakfast was delightful! They offer four different kinds of cereal (crispy rice, cocoa crispy rice, corn flakes, frosted corn flakes), cheese (mozzarella, offered only on 4 out of the 7 days), toast (very thin, in both white and whole wheat), croissants (my friend/travel companion couldnt believe how fresh they were), tea, coffee, apple and orange juice, and various spreads/preserves (little single-serving packets). The food isnt fancy, but its free and tasty.The RoomThe room had its plusses and minuses. The walls were littered with scuff-marks, but these are easily ignored. The bathroom tile in our room was coming off in places, with cracked grout. This was not an issue, as the tile was clean and the bathroom was otherwise very, very nice. The shower, toilet, sink and fixtures look like they were recently updated.Our room was a twin room (two twin beds). I was under the impression that the rooms would be so small that we would barely be able to walk around the beds. To my surprise, the room was a good size; in front of the beds was an extra 4-feet of space. This was more than enough area to sit our bags down and still have a comfortable path to walk. There was also a good-sized wardrobe that we could have fit all of our gear in, with room to spare.There is a television in each room. The televisions receive five channels, BBC One, BBC Two, ITV1, 4, and Five. This is more than adequate for watching a bit of telly to unwind in the evening. If this does not suffice for you, there is a large-screen television in the lounge, with comfortable chairs and tables to sit at while you watch the satellite/cable channels.The linens are clean and the mattresses comfortable (keep in mind Im used to sleeping on springs--if youre used to an upscale Serta or TempurPedic, you may not find it as comfortable).The ServiceThe service is exceptional. The room is tidied daily (bathroom wiped down, coffee/tea replenished, beds made and freshened, floors vacuumed). You only get one towel change during the week (ours was Tuesday); but, as I do not shower everyday, this was not an issue. If you do shower often, you may want to bring an extra towel, as well as a hand/face cloth.The in-room coffee and tea consists of two packets of instant coffee, two packets of PG Tips tea, two creams and a handful of sugar packets. I found, after two days, this was insufficient, so I left a note that said Please leave extra tea/milks. Thank you! along with 60p. When I arrived back at the hotel that night, I found four packets of tea and four creams. This became the norm for every subsequent tea replenishing.The front desk staff is also very nice and were willing to answer questions. My friend was in need of a wake-up call one day (my battery-powered alarm I brought from home was on the fritz), and asked the front desk if they could help (no clocks or telephones in the room). The next morning, at 6:50AM (as requested) a knock at the door came to wake my friend up. One of the front desk staff members took the time to come to the third floor to give the wake-up call. This reflects how nice the staff truly is.The LocationThe location is good. The hotel is less than two blocks from Queensway, which is a main thoroughfare offering a Boots (pharmacy), Tesco (small grocery store), and many restaurants. The Bayswater Tube Station is about a five minute walk from the hotel (+/- three blocks down Queensway).OtherThe hotel is currently under construction. I found no problems with noise. My only qualm about the construction was that the main entrance shifted from one door to another. This was not an issue as everything was clearly marked and there were signs everywhere telling you how to get to reception.Overall, this hotel was great! The price, compared to other London hotels, is fantastic. Please consider this hotel for your next stay in London."
36,927,"Apr 24 2009 	Good value for money central location safe clean and with friendly staff	I spent only one night at the London House Hotel in Bayswater, and it was very good value for money. I paid  56 for a single room, but they upgraded it to a double. The room was very spacious, clean and modern. The only thing I was missing in the room, was a whole figure mirror and a chair or equivalent to put clothes/luggage on. The staff was friendly and serviceminded. The location was good, in a fairly quiet street, close to Bayswater underground station. The hotel has a pick-up service that comes to the hotel and takes you to the airport. I think it was worth  15 not having to drag my luggage on to the Heathrow Express train or underground. The minibus dropped me off right outside the correct terminal.I had to leave very early so I couldn't have breakfast so I can't say anything about their food. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the hotel and will definately stay there again when I go to London."
37,927,"Apr 20 2009 	Good value great location decent room.	My teenage daughter and I spent three nights at the London House in mid-April. I've stayed in budget hotels in London before, so I was braced for what we'd find, and was neither happily surprised nor disappointed: the room was cramped and the amenities minimal, but it was mostly clean and the beds were comfortable enough. On the negative side: no closet (just a small and cheaply-made wardrobe and two small nightstands); tiny bathroom with no shelfspace for toiletries; one smallish bath towel for each guest (no hand towel or washcloth). The room itself was clean, though the walls were scuffed and stained; the toilet seemed to have been cleaned rather carelessly before our arrival. I could feel the springs in the mattress when I ran my hand over it, but I found the bed surprisingly comfortable for sleeping. (Other reviewers have been less pleased with the beds, so obviously YMMV). The breakfast, which is included in the price, is minimal (toast, cheese, pastries, suspicously pale orange juice, coffee, hot chocolate), and is edible but not at all interesting. On the positive side: unlike most hotels, this one has space under the beds for suitcase storage (though they don't vacuum well underneath). We paid about $110/night for two people, which is very good for a Zone 1 London location; the Bayswater Tube station is just around the corner, and the Queensway station just a couple of blocks beyond that. There are plenty of restaurants, shops and markets very close by, and the neighborhood is pleasant. The Portobello Road market is about one mile away, an easy walk. I found the desk staff to be pleasant and efficient; we were able to check into our room at about 11:00 in the morning upon our arrival, which was a pleasant surprise, and they were helpful and responsive when we had a problem with the bathroom exhaust fan. Overall, next time I'll probably spend a few more bucks and get a nicer place if I'm traveling with family members, but if I'm by myself this hotel is absolutely fine."
38,927,Apr 19 2009 	Comfy room	The room was comfy with a nice sized bathroom. The price is also very reasonable. The only bad experience I had was that the fire alarm went off 3 times in an hour..highly annoying! other than that I enjoyed my stay there.
39,927,"Apr 10 2009 	Absolutely Fantastic great value for money	The London House Hotel provided me and my family with the perfect stay. Firstly, the location was excellent and very central. It is within two minutes walk of two underground stations as well as five minutes walk to Hyde Park. Also down the road from the hotel is a very nice shopping centre. It was very easy and quick to get to all the tourist sites staying at this hotel. When we first came to the hotel we were very suprised by the cleanliness and design of the hotel as the room prices were cheap. In fact all the rooms had been newly decorated and our bedroom had a new and very clean bathroom. There is also a new cafe at the hotel and a lobby with a big plasma TV and internet service, so we enjoyed having a drink in the lobby with the children when we got back from touring. The hotel service was very friendly and there is also a brand new lift. I would very much recommend this hotel to anyone as it is very good value for money. It was the cheapest place I could find in London which was of a high standard, as London is a very expensive place to stay the prices here were very reasonable. I will defintely be visiting here again."
40,927,"Apr 10 2009 	most uncomfortable mattress!	My daughter and I are just back from this hotel and my back is still suffering! The lumpiest mattress that I have ever slept in in one of the smallest rooms! I did sleep to the management and he has assured me that they are replacing all the mattresses- not before time. There is a lot of external work going on at the moment so scaffolding on the front of the hotel and they start early in the morning. We were on the ground floor at the back so heard them talking as if they were in the room with us!The breakfast was very limited, toast, croissants and cereals. Good coffee though so I would advise you to buy some fruit or juice at the nearby shops. Whiteleys on the corner has some lovely restaurants and delis.Another thing I noted was that we got one towel each which was to do us for the three night stay so take a hand towel with you!"
41,927,"Mar 23 2009 	Would definitely stay here again	Firstly, in response to the previous review, I found the breakfast fine and quite varied. These days many hotels do not include breakfast at all, so I was happy with it. There were croissants, toast, yogurts, juice (strange tasting as it was), coffee, tea and three cereals - not bad for a 2-star.Yes, the rooms are small - but immaculately clean. Hairdryer, television, linen, soap, tea and coffee facilities are included - again, hardly standard in a 2-star.I loved the location and found the staff perfectly nice. I was sad to have to leave and stay in a grotty hostel for the next 2 nights of my few days in England."
42,927,"Mar 17 2009 	Cozy clean good for the price	I was travelling alone on the way back from Spain, so I was trying to find a hotel with easy access from Paddington Station and with elevator.This hotel is only about 5min on taxi from Paddington Station and easy to find.It has elevator but you may need to go up several stairs if your room is located in between the floors.The room was small single room,Single en-suite, but the shower and toilet room was clean and nice.As the hotel is located close to quiet residencial area, it was quiet enough for a good sleep.The breakfast is only with thin toasts with jam, tasteless cheese, coffee and fruit juice.Anyway, I didn't expect much for foods so it was acceptable and good enough so I don't need go out to buy.I saw some people just bought some nicer bread or something and eat there.There are 3 PCs you can use with coins so that you can check your e-mails.If you are looking for a clean cozy hotel close from Paddington but more quiet area,I recommend you to try here. ;-)"
43,927,"Mar 11 2009 	Sadly disappointing	I had read the previous reviews about the rooms being small and the continental breakfast leaving a lot to be desired and this didn't bother us so we booked for a 3 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Yes the rooms are spotlessly clean, the bed comfy, the view from our window overlooking the garden was pretty and the location was fantastic (we always book for the Bayswater/Notting Hill/Kensington area), but there were a couple of things that just niggled us too much to return here.The breakfast is purely 3 types of cereal (cornflakes, frosties and coco pops) plus toast and preserves and really is the bare minimum of the word &quot;continental&quot; so we didn't even bother eating here. If they provided fruit, museli, croissants, ham - anything like this it would have been a great improvement.Yes the rooms are small which is OK but it would have been nice to have a chair to sit on instead of watching TV on the bed as there is just enough room. I know you don't go to London to spend time in the room (which is why we booked a cheaper hotel), however sometimes you just need to take the weight of your feet and rest from all the walking/sightseeing you have done during the day but obviously this is purely our preference and may not bother other people.The main bug-bear we had was with the unnecessary little noises. I will give you an example; because the hotel is small and the doors aren't spring locked, whenever anyone walks in and out of their hotel room during the day/night the door doesn't close quietly and you can always here what is going on which can become rather annoying. If the doors were fitted with slow-closing spring locks this would have avoided the problem. Another issue was with the builders who started sanding at 8am and banging at 9am which isn't very nice when you are laying in bed, however to be fair, we were aware there would be building work at this hotel when we booked it, we just didn't expect to be woken at 8am! Worse than this was the noise of the cleaning staff shouting at each other down the corridors at 8.30am, this really was unacceptable, also when getting into the lift with our luggage as we were due to depart we had to wrestle for the space in the lift with the cleaning staff when any good hotel with good customer service knows the guests come first, especially when they have luggage. At one point we didn't know if my husband would manage to get into the lift with me because they didn't allow him space!I must admit that although the issues which bugged us may seem trivial to some people, I still feel the need to paint a complete picture with all the positives as well as negatives purely because the combination of factors annoyed us enough to make the decision not to return here. We have stayed in many hotels in London within this price range so I know we aren't asking for too much when we don't want to be woken by shouting and sanding! I do find it a great shame that these things happened as it would have been a place I would have loved to return to, but next time we will choose a hotel in the same square but across the road as there were other options."
44,927,"Feb 28 2009 	Great value great location! Will come back!	This hotel is a budget hotel. I was weary of staying here after reading some of the reviews....but I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel's location is perfect (right by the bayswater tube line, which takes you to the circle tube line (subway line) and the cirlce line goes EVERYWHERE). Its in a nice area that was safe to walk around in at night, very quiet and clean. The rooms where extreemely clean and even thought it was obvious they where furnished on a budget (all ikea stuff), everything was well taken care off. Bathroom was more than adequate, they had a coffee pot in the room and even a blow dryer in one of the drawers. The only complaint I would have is that the bed was EXTREMELY squeaky. Just turning on the bed made a raquet. And the walls where thin, so we could hear the neighbor's bed squeaking too..but the truth is, you're so exhausted at the end of the day from sightseeing that you just crash anyway.It was definetely a good value, and I will come back if I have to go back to london on a budget."
45,927,"Feb 22 2009 	Great location on a budget	London House is was one of the most reasonable &amp; conveniently located hotels I could find, considering the various reviews I had seen.I booked a double room and got one on the 2nd (U.S. 3rd) floor and it was quite basic and clean with a view of the park although not very spacious. Housekeeping seemed to be every other day although tea &amp; coffee service in the rooms were checked regularly which was nice. Breakfast was included although nothing extravagant but great if you're on a budget since you could eat as much toast, cheese, or cereal as you wanted.The location is great with Queensway a short walk away (Bayswater is an extra few minutes but it's right on the Central Line that will take you to most major areas) not to mention a 10-15min walk to Notting Hill AND a one station stop (or about a 20min walk) away from Paddington Station, perfect for catching the Heathrow Express/Connect to Heathrow Airport. There are also many restaurants, grocery/convenience stores, currency exchange spots, as well as the beautiful and spacious Hyde Park.The only downside was perhaps the noise from the washroom fan which would run for a good 20-30 min after the lights were turned off (although there's a switch above the door which tells you NOT to turn it off) and there was one night we had noisy neighbours.This is a simple hotel so if you just need a place to sleep after a day of seeing the city then this should do just fine."
46,927,"Feb 2 2009 	Good for Money but Noisy	Good location right next to Bayswater tube and a little further to Queensway. My only concerns were building work being carried out on the front of the hotel. This started at 9am most mornings which was not nice to wake up to the noise of hammers and drills.The rooms are quite small. In our group we booked a single, a twin and a double. The double was the smallest room with the twin and single being much bigger.I would stay again because of the price (50 a night aint bad in london), but would probably ask for a room at the back of the hotel to avoid the noisy construction work."
47,927,"Dec 28 2008 	Excellent hotel	Stayed for 3 nights 20th-23rd Dec and after reading some of the earlier reviews I didn't quite know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and happy with our stay. The hotel is easy to find, just a few minutes from Paddington to Bayswater, a few minutes up the road and you're there, a very central location for all your London needs. The reception staff were welcoming and the room, although small was perfectly adequate and above all very clean and comfortable, we were up on the third floor and had a nice view of the garden square below which is quiet with little traffic. Breakfast is basic, toast, jams, cereals, cheese, croissants, juice and hot drinks but you can have as much or as little as you like and we found it to be quite sufficient to start off the day. The only negative thing I will mention is that the double lock on the inside of the room door was faulty so couldn't be locked, I reported this to reception within an hour of being there and nothing was ever done about it, I wouldn't have minded but being that it was just me and my 5 yr old son I would have felt more secure being able to double lock the door. Saying that I never felt unsafe in this hotel but my sister and her partner were able to get in and come up to my room at gone 10pm at night without any challenge from reception. Despite this slight security issue I would not hesitate to stay at the hotel again, the value was excellent, the room was good and the stay was pleasant., they have a secure luggage room to store your bags on day of departure which was handy as check out is a rather early 10.30am. A really great budget hotel in a central location without the cheap feel to it. Would recommend this hotel and as a regular visitor to London will definitely consider again."
48,927,"Dec 19 2008 	Absolutely Perfect Budget Accomodation	This Hotel is absolutely fantastic for the budget traveller. I was a bit wary reading some of the reviews but I have nothing but good things to say about the hotel. They are doing renovation work and we stayed in one room, at the back of the hotel which was a little noisy in the morning but nothing too bad. I stayed there last week aswell(before booking another room this week) and that room was great. The rooms are so so clean and the shower is fabulous! The reception staff really were excellent....very very friendly and helpful! The location is so perfect too! Definately will stay here again!"
49,927,"Dec 19 2008 	good location good budget hotel	Can't complain about our stay at London House. It is excellently located close to Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and bus stops, in a very nice square. Our room was below street level, but clean and relatively roomy. Ensuite was a decent size and the wardrobe had wooden hangers. Breakfast was simple but perfectly adequate, and we had no problems with the staff. The walls are a bit thin (we could hear the neighbour sneeze),so bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper! Otherwise, I would recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget. Around the hotel, there are many local restaurants, a shopping centre and shops for basic needs - laundromat, chemist, post office, souvenir shops... it's also walking distance to notting hill and hyde park."
50,927,"Dec 8 2008 	Good for the price	We booked a room just few days before going to London in what turned out to be a very crowded weekend, so I guess we were very lucky. The Hotel is located in a quiet place, very close to Bayswater tube station, so one can move easily around. The room was very small but comfortable and reasonably clean. The girls at the reception were nice and friendly, excepted the one that we met in the morning of our arrival (6th december)...may be she had a bad day? The breakfast is the only bad point of our stay (quite poor), but we think we will come back."
51,927,"Nov 13 2008 	new budget hotel clean continental breakfast	We booked a room w/ AC at this newly remodeled budget hotel in a fantastic london location. We easily walked to the Tube, to Notting Hill, Hyde Park, etc. great locale. Price is appropriate for London, and it is a budget hotel but with a nice look and feel. I would recommend it. Breakfast was continental, but quite nice w/ very average coffee."
52,927,"Nov 11 2008	Decent Budget Hotel	We stayed at the London House Hotel in Oct for 2 nights. It's your basic budget hotel, but is well situated less than 5 mins walk from Bayswater Tube and shops/ cafes. Rooms were comfortable, although the bed wasn't. Staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast room great. Would recommend as a cheap option for a short term stay in London."
53,927,"Oct 26 2008 	What more could you ask for	This is a budget hotel. We stayed for 1 night and it cost about GBP65 (double room, two ocupants). The hotel is clean and modern. Staff were freindly and accomodating. The room, with en-suite facilities, was compact but clean and perfectly functional. The room has TV, Air conditioning and tea &amp; coffee making facilites. The only issue that I had with the room was that the air con control was beside the wardrobe so it wasn't possible to see what the buttons were for. One other fault I would pick with this hotel is that the breakfast was a bit rubbish, it says continental breakfast but all you get is some toast (if you can call it that, it was more like slightly warm bread), some cheese slices and jam/marmalade. Tea, coffee and squash. If you want a decent breakfast go find a cafe nearby. There are still building works going on at the hotel but this isn't an issue as they only carry out the work during normal working hours. All in all I was very satisfied with this hotel and would go back there again. The hotel offers excellent value for money. If you want some fancy luxury hotel book into the Hilton (or similar), if you want mega cheap accomodation go to a hostel. If you want a good value hotel go to the London House Hotel."
54,927,"Oct 18 2008 	Great location and service	Situated in the Bayswater area, the London House Hotel is nearby nearly everything.It takes about 5 minutes to walk from the tube station (Bayswater,District and Cirlce Line) to walk to the hotel.On Queensway you can find lots of restaurants, shops and pubs.I stayed 2 nights and had a single room. My room (LL1) was situated at the back of the hotel and was between 2 floors.My room was small, but very comfartable. The bathroom was okay in size.The hotel has a locked room to store your luggage.I found staff very friendly and above all helpfull. I was one of the stranded travellers affected by the fire in the tunnel. They provided me with all the necessary information and tips.I visit London quite often and have never stayed at the same hoteltwice. When returning I shall look for promotions at this hotel as I enjoyed my stay here. I would also recommend it to others."
55,927,"Oct 15 2008 	Good value for money	I spend at least 2 nights a week in hotels in the price bracket of this one, and I can say that I have not found a better one in London so far. The facilities are basic, but at least everything is generally working and in good condition. It has obviously been renovated fairly recently, which helps put it a cut above the rest of it's peers.I haven't sampled the breakfast, as at this price, I'm unlikely to want it, but for somewhere cheap &amp; clean to get your head down, it's pretty good.Location is good, short walk from Bayswater tube, and close to restaurants, shops and parks."
56,927,"Sep 28 2008 	Horrible bed aweful hotel!	This hotel is in a decent location and has clean rooms and bathrooms. However, the bed was aweful. We almost fell off of it because the matresses were so bad. Besides that, they were in the middle of renovating therefore had a lot of noise during the day. Our room vent covers were missing so we could see straight into the walls which creeped me out. On the plus side, it is in a safe area and was right next to a train station. It is affordable for the thrifty traveler. I would not stay here again!"
57,927,"Sep 27 2008	Liar House Hotel -Don't Stay!	Not only is this hotel a total swamp, the staff lied point-blank about the construction being finished. I contacted a representative in April 2008 who told me the construction would be completely finished in June 2008.So imagine our shock and horror when we arrived in September 2008 after a thirteen hour flight from Seattle.We went to our room to crash and were awakened by what sounded like a wrecking ball bashing the outside window. Then power drills, saws, loud conversation...we opened our window and saw the scaffolding over the outside. We realized we were in a complete construction zone. &quot;No problem,&quot; I thought. &quot;I will go down and show them the email from their staff and get a full refund.&quot; Hardly.Three blank stares and shrugs later, LHH refused to take any responsibility for their actions, let alone give us a refund. They also claimed the fact that the hotel is under construction is stated clearly on their website and on Expedia, neither of which is true. The only thing worse then the uproarious opera of power tools going on outside our room, the construction dust and debri in the hallway, was the staff's cold apathy and duplicitous behavior toward our problem.Exhausted, desperate, and scared we finally called Expedia, who found us a new hotel that night around 5 p.m. Even then, LHH insisted on charging us for two nights, even though being held hostage in a construction site is hardly what I would call consensual patronage. Not only is LHH under such severe construction it should not even be open, the staff is completely cold and uncaring when it comes to taking responsibility for their mistakes.As a result, we spent our first day in London cold, extremely tired, and fighting back tears. This shell-shocked start to a &quot;vacation&quot; was largely due to this blatant bait-and-switch hotel. If you value customer service and want to uphold its global standard, I beg you not to stay here. The only way we can put an end to this kind of breach of common decency is to not give these people our business."
58,927,"Sep 18 2008 	good value for money	We stayed there for two nights on march 2007. considering the high cost of London hotel, this hotel gives good value for money. the room is very small but clean. the hotel was renovated two years ago. it is very basic.the location is good.one thing is that when we arrived to London, we lost out luggage. We were very upset and asked for any help from the receptions, but she was not nice at all and sent us to the out of order payphone.the morning after, the other receptionist was much nicer though.I'd come again if I am on budget."
59,927,"Aug 23 2008 	LONDON house = LOCATION Location	Hi fellow travelers,My boyfriend and i stayed for 3 nights (19 - 22 aug 2008) at the London House hotel. And we really enjoyed our stay. Yes, the rooms are small, and they are renovating the hotel, but we didn't had any problems with the noise, at 5 oclock they stop working, and if you want to enjoy your stay in London, you won't be in your room anyway.The location is super!! it's a +- 5 min walk to the metrostation bayswater, and a +- 10 min walk to Queensway. And it's a+- 30 min to Heathrow airport.I really recommend this hotel, just alone for the location.Have some dinner at Salvador and Amanda (spanish food) or Chiquito rest bar (mexican food) near leicester square. Nice atmosphere"
60,927,"Aug 19 2008 	More of a hostel than a hotel	We would never stay here again and don't recommend that you do, but if you are looking for something one small step above a hostel that is cheap by London standards, then this will do.The London House is a fine place to stay if you are used to staying in hostels. It has a backpacker vibe and doesn't really feel like a hotel and, like everything in London, you pay a lot for what you get. On the positive side, the rooms are clean. Ours was small but recently renovated, it even had a plasma tv if you are into that. The location is decent, but not great. There are a few tube stations, Hyde Park, and Oxford Street in reasonable walking distance but the major tourist spots (british museum, westminster abbey, london eye, tower of london, etc.) are quite a trek.On the negative side the beds were horribly uncomfortable and the walls were paper thin so we had a hard time sleeping. There was construction going on all over the hotel and the elevator was broken the morning we stayed there. We also didn't find the staff particularly helpful or friendly. We arrived off an overnight flight and were told that it would be impossible to check into our room a minute before two and that the only place we could wait was in the lounge, where a man was in the middle of very loud renovations with power tools. Eventually we managed to get into the room at around quarter past one but were made to feel as though we had asked a really incredible favor."
61,927,"Aug 6 2008 	Nice hotel nice location friendly staff	I just came from spending 3 nights at this hotel. We got a pretty good deal booking through the website directly. The staff was very nice and very helpful. I sent them a couple of emails prior to my arrival and they were prompt to answer. The hotel is in a good location, there are several restaurants around, a nice shopping mall with movies, a couple of parks (Kensington and Hyde Park), and several tube stations within walking distance. The rooms were nice and clean. However there was not a phone in the room (not sure if it was only ours or not). There is some construction going on right now but they only work from about 8:30 am until about 5 pm so it should be okay (unless you are planning on sleeping in). I think they can improve the breakfast a little, it is very basic - only a couple of cereals (Special K and Coco Pops), white toast and croissants. The juice was not that good either, however the coffee was really good. At least it was something to get you going in the morning and at London Hotel prices, I should not complaint too much. The value of this hotel is really good, I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to anyone. From the airport you have a couple of options (one long way and inexpensive or the short and a little pricey). The long way is taking the Picadilly Line and changing tubes in Hoborn to Queensway - it is easy but it took like a good hour or more and it was hot...but the ride was only $4 pounds per person. On the way back to the airport we had to take an early flight so we decided to go to the Paddington Station and take the Heathrow Express, the ride is pricey $15.50 pounds per person but it only takes 15 minutes and the ride is nice and air conditioned. The Paddington station is about 10 minutes walking from the hotel. If you arrive at Queensway station, when you exit the station make a left and walk until you reach Porchester Gardens (A big shopping mall called Whiteleys' is in the corner) and make a left, then make a right on Kensington Gardens and the hotel is half way on the right side (you will see the number 81 painted on the column outside). Another recommendation, you must go to Tuk Tuk Thai restaurant. I think we ate there almost every day, the food was really good, the portions were big and the prices were very reasonable."
62,927,"Aug 1 2008	Pleasantly Surprised!	I booked this hotel after I couldn't get into anything near the Russell Square side of London - what a blessing in disguise!! For the same price as the Royal National (which is not a nice experience) you get much much better accommodation.The room was small but recently refurbished. I wasn't planning to spend a lot of time in the room so its size was just right! The bathroom was also small but clean and fresh. I didn't realise an all you can eat continental breakfast was included so that was a really nice surprise. It was the easiest walk to Bayswater and Queensway stations which meant you had easy access to the whole of London. Also, this hotel was in a nice area, it felt safe, there were plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance. All in all this was a good value for money hotel in an excellent location. Would definetely stay here again."
63,927,Jul 29 2008 	Very nice!	Really nice hotel. Clean and helpful staff.
64,927,"Jul 16 2008 	Great Hotel Perfect Location	Loved this hotel. Comfortable beds, fantastic shower, spotlessly clean. Front desk staff was extra helpful. They have coin-slot Internet access - very useful! Only two blocks away from the underground station serving two major lines.Have seen some reviews mention small rooms. Yes, the rooms are smaller than your average US hotel. Nearly every hotel we stayed at while in the UK had very small rooms. Just keep in mind when these buildings were originally constructed.Scaffolding for improvements were up during our stay, but they kept construction to workday hours so we were never disturbed by it.Thanks for a great stay!"
65,927,"May 19 2008 	Great place to stay	Stayed here for a week in total after extending a couple of times during our stay. Most of the staff were very accommodating and helpful. We were aware of the renovations taking place, so that wasn't a suprise, but no sleeping in. They are finished by 5pm anyway. Rooms are light and a decent size, comfy bed and nice linens provided. Breaky was simple, nice big clean breakfast room. Location was great. Main road of Bayswater 100m away with anything you could possibly need (try Tuk Tuk thai restaurant) and the circle line tube also really close. This place will be fantastic once all the reno's and noise stops (if they still keep the prices reasonable). Try and get a room facing the street/park as there is a lovely view and lots of light in these rooms. I think it's a top find for affordable, pleasant accommodation right in the middle of London. We will be coming back."
66,927,"May 14 2008	fine hotel for city trip	I've just returned from a 4-day city trip to Londen where I stayed in the Londen House Hotel (room 102). Before going, I've read several reviews about this hotel on tripadvisor and found out that 50% is positive and 50% is negative, so that didn't help me in making my choice.First of all: I had a great time in Londen and in staying in the London House hotel.The hotel is being renovated at this moment (14 may 2008) and therefore not all the rooms will be ready yet. Our room renovatedon the first floor had already been. It was not large but large enough. The bathroom with shower was nice and the double bed was fine for sleeping purposes. Of course there are some things the hotel can/should still improve. Most important are: breakfast (I misted some meat and other breakfast stuff like ham and cheese), tv reception is bad, the mattrass, which is far from comfartable. I've slept on the quilt instead of underneath it, because you could feel the springs pricking in your back. the walls: theire not really thick so you can hear your neighboors if they are noisy (we only experienced that the last night).positive: the location: it's very close to whiteleys shopping centre (which is also begin upgraded). And close to 2 underground stations (queensway and bayswater), and both Hyde park and Kensington Gardens. the staff: which is very kind and helpfull.Overall experience is good. Extra positive point: unlike some other hotels, the london house hotel has a luggage room where you can leave your luggage after you've checked out, so you can go sightseeing your last day without carrying around al your suitcases etc."
67,927,"May 4 2008 	Good hotel - the value is hard to beat!	The 3 of us stayed at the London House Hotel from 14th to 16th of April. The location was excellent. It takes only 5 minutes to Bayswater station and 7 minutes to Queensway station on foot. There was basically no problem with the staff. As I could tell, mostly Polish people work there. ...and some of the girls were very pretty. There was also a French guy at the reception or at least he spoke with a French accent. He was not rude, he only answered my questions in short sentences. Maybe some people take that as rude, but it was fine with me. I personally don't like giggly receptionists. (Especially giggly men as I am a man, too :-))The rooms were clean. I really liked the bathroom, as it was brand new. Simple, a bit small, but clean.  The room we stayed at was a triple room on the 3rd floor. The hotel has a nice new elavator, which was perhaps the main reason we chose this hotel. It is true, that the rooms are not spacious. The 3 beds were a little bit jammed in the room. However, if you want to stay in a big room, you should spend 150 pounds or maybe just stay at home. BUT if you want to see London and stay at a reasonably priced place in a very convenient location, then London House Hotel is the place for you."
68,927,"Apr 27 2008 	Don't stay here	I have just come back from a three night stay in London at this hotel. The only good thing about it is the location. The room they gave us was in the basement (B2) with a small sash window looking onto a tiny dingy courtyard wih the street overhead. The room was so small - it would have passed for a small single room but there were four bunk beds in it. It resembled a prison cell. It was uncomfortable as there was no bedside table or lamp - only the central light at the entrance. There was no telephone. It was clean. The bathroom had the smallest sink I've ever seen.The walls were so thin you could hear every single action from the next room. The fire exit was a very narrow exit through bars on the windows (only for thin people).Some of this discomfort would have been redeemed had the staff been even a little pleasant at any time during the stay. But from the moment we arrived, we received universal unfriendliness from the staff. From the reception staff to the breakfast to the cleaning staff, I've never met such an unfriendly lot in a service industry.This hotel is at the level of a youth hostel. Kids might be less concerned about these matters and be prepared to accept the discomfort for the location. For everyone else, I would say this is a no no.From a very disgruntled traveller"
69,927,Apr 20 2008	Great Value	Fantastic Location and very near Bayswater train station.Value for money for the private ensuite we got! Quite pretty with a flat screen TV. Our only complaint is that the sink was very low - Like for children's height.Breakfast was good and decent too though simple.Would choose to stay there again.
70,927,"Apr 19 2008 	Good Hotel Great Value!	I booked this hotel slightly apprehensively from reading other reviews on Trip Advisor, but we managed to get a double en-suite room for 55 direct from the hotels website so I thought we'd risk it.We arrived at Bayswater tube station (easy to get to from both Euston &amp; St Pancras as there all on the circle line) and were quite impressed with Bayswater high street as it had lots of shops , pubs, restaurants &amp; fast food places. The hotel's location is facing a small park in a very posh looking area, just off the high street and is only about 5 mins walk (or less) from the tube.Walking into the hotel you could tell that everything was new and very stylish (lots of wood, Brown leather and LCD TVs). We had to wait a few minutes for our room as we were early to check in (before 2pm). But the girls on reception were friendly and seemed to know what they were doing.We got to the room on the 5th floor (via the brand new lift) and were quite impressed, again everything was new and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was nice, and they provided enough towels and also shower gel &amp; shampoo. The room had a lovely view of the park outside and also had an LCD TV with a few channels.If you are traveling on Business its worth mentioning that the Free WI-FI only seems to work on the lower floors. The breakfast was okay, just simple Brown / White Toast, Jam, Juice &amp; Cereal, they do call it a limited continental after all so I wasn't at all disappointed.When booking the hotel we were informed about the noise, and to be honest were not really bothered by it. The builders started at around 9 and were finished by the time we got back. We didn't come to London to sleep all day, and it wasn't noisy at night, and it obviosly shows the hotels is improving with the work being done to it. The bed was a bit creeky, and I probably could spend a week on it, but for a few days it'd be fine.When we checked out we left our luggage in the free Luggage room, it is locked, but guests have to request the key and go in to get their luggage out, so I wouldn't trust it for valuables as it is not manned by anyone.In summary I had a really pleasant stay in this newly refurbished hotel and paid an excellent price for it. I think it unfair that people are complaining about the Breakfast or the noise as the rates are so cheap. People who require a continental breakfast with croissants, ham cheese etc should go elsewhere (and pay 100+ a night) or why not stop at this hotel, find a Wetherspoons and get a Full English for 2.69 if having a big breakfast is important to you.I would definitely stay at the hotel again (as long as the rates didn't go up too much) as it is in a great area, was clean, comfortable and great value."
71,927,"Apr 11 2008	Fantastic!	I really enjoyed my stay with London House Hotel. My room was quite spacious (single room with bathroom) and the bathroom was sparkling it was so clean. The bed was comfortable and the staff were extremely helpful. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, great location and excellent experience. I stayed in a hotel shortly after (in bayswater) and should have continued to stay at london house hotel instead (much bigger room and less noise)."
72,927,Apr 9 2008 	A great value	I just came back from a 6 night stay and would definitely book this hotel again. The room was clean with a very nice new bathroom and a shower with great water pressure. The staff was friendly and helpful. The location was convenient with a 5 minute walk to the Bayswater Tube Station and several stores/a mall within easy walking distance. There was a lift that went to all floors and the breakfast seems to have improved over earlier reviews. It would be difficult to find a cheaper hotel in London!
73,927,"Feb 23 2008	The worst hotel on earth!!!	We arrived in London jet lagged from Los Angeles to be told that we couldn't check in until 2pm (it was 12pm). We were freezing, tired foand cold and the reception staff were extremely unwelcoming - they couldn't even crack a smile. We finally got our room (small, but clean) and as soon as we sat down on the bed the construction started - from 8am - 5pm every day (yes and on weekends) we were subjected to constant banging, drilling. My jet lagged lasted r a week due to the fact that we just couldn't catch up on sleep because of this construction.The walls were extremely thin and it seemed like our neighbours were sitting in our room with us.The only good thing about the hotel was the location - Bayswater is lovely and there are plenty of other hotels in the area. I would strongly suggest that you AVOID this hotel. The only reason we stayed was because we had already paid on arrival and they wouldn't give us a refund."
74,927,"Feb 15 2008 	Half term stay.	There isn't a lift but we were offered the assistance of a chap who worked there,if I was on my own with my child then I would've accepted. No lift and we were on top floor. Rooms had cracks on the wall and only a kettle (so take your own tea/coffee/milk) We had to pay a refundable 5.00 for the hairdryer and 10.00 for the remote control.The television in our room wasn't tuned in properly(ghosting) and the channels not where they should be. The milk for the cereal was warm(most people liked it that way apparently) almost toasted bread. The beds are made everyday but towels are not changed daily. It was a good base to see a show and get out &amp; about.  Good: We had a problem with a hole without a grill and the noise was awful from the other bedroom,after reporting it to the night manager it was fixed before we got back the following night.Bad: If you want natural air-conditioning then ask for room 417- as there was a gap at the top of the window. They are old sash windows and not double glazed."
75,927,"Feb 11 2008 	just fine	We checked before - renovation they advertase advance. So no surprise there. Noise started at 7 am but who wants to spend day in hotel anny way?It was clean, not to expensive and rooms are just renovated so it is big plus.Breacfast was tosted bread, butter and jam. There is coffe, milk, tee, hot chocolate - with water and some kinde of juice too.Location is great, aria is cute and near bus and subway. Hyde park not far too. Excelant for budget travelers that need night rest and clean room."
76,927,"Feb 3 2008 	London House was fine.	We stayed at the london house for 4 days and we found our stay was pleasant, the rooms were small and i would advise any one who is larger than average to be wary because the bathroom we had offered little room for moving about even though my girlfriend and i are of quite slender builds. the position was ok with easy access to the tube and just down the road from kensington gardens. the staff were polite and were happy to help us with whatever we needed. there is no elevator this wasn't a problem for me but i did see some people having some trouble. the breakfast was only a large communal bowl of cornflakes and some questionable toast i can see why some would complain but for me it was fine, over all i was happy with the london house and would stay there again."
77,927,"Jan 23 2008 	Stay Away!!!!!	We saw a completely different hotel at their web site. We were told on arrival they were renovating the place, but forgive me, why hadn't they told us that in advance? There is no lift and no one to help you with your luggage. They didn't even care that I was walking with a cane. All of the hotel was dirty and dusty because of the ongoing constructions. The rooms were at least clean but the linen stained. We were given a small towel each that of course was never changed during our 4 days stay. We were asked for a 10 pound deposit for the remote control of the TV. That was the first time I'd heard of s.th like this.The breakfast was just warm toast with jelly and something that reminded of coffee.The place is very close to the tube and to a very nice shoping centre but bear in mind the whole area is packed with hotels, most of them look nicer and affordable."
78,927,"Nov 22 2007	London House Hotel	I went there in September 2007; despite some big and noise work in progress, stay there was fine.Good:room clean and with a good view over a garden; breakfast in great quantity; location; kind staff.Bad: no elevator"
79,927,"Nov 9 2007 	Avoid the London House rip off!	Don't be fooled by this one's promises!! We booked through travelstay.com and won't use them again. They obviously didn't check this place out. Or if they did, they didn't care! We reserved the &quot;best&quot; room with private bath. What we got was a 9 x 9 room with a very tight bathroom. Outside our window in the morning - at 7:00 - 7:30 we got loud construction and exhaust fumes from trucks, and noise from the kitchen downstairs and loud music and conversations. Walls are paper thin, you will here everyone and everything!! The &quot;laundry facility&quot; consist of a tiny dirty room with one washer and one dryer to be shared by 90 rooms, so don't expect to use that ever, and I'm not sure you would want to. There's no coffee or tea in the lobby, that's bull. Continental breakfast is toast and jelly, and if you are lucky, a luke warm cup of something from a machine resembling coffee. Truly a desperate person's meal. The bed linens were stained and had hairs on them. You got one very small thin bath towel, but no others. Manager and many staff members were foreign, not British, so hard to understand and deal with. Not the least bit polite or accommodating. Didn't care about construction noise and told us they were remodeling the hotel and we should not have booked there if we didn't expect noise and inconvenience! There are so many other places available so don't settle for this lousy place.! Transportation in and around London is very easy and you would do better to stay a few miles away and hope the tube or train in. We moved on to a better hotel and took the train into central London each day and it was easy and sooo much more comfortable at a nicer place!!"
80,927,"Oct 29 2007 	London House: First rate for a one star hotel	I booked the London House through Expedia with some good discount. There were no hotels with this excellent location even near this price range. I'd read some positive reviews bout the hotel on Trip Advisor and was even more pleasantly surprised on my arrival. The Double room overlooked the quiet gardens and gave a taste of the Georgian architecture suurounding Kensington gardens. It was clean with some basic furniture. The ensuite bathroom was beautifully tiled with a great shower. (Belive me I've seen some monstrous excuses for bathrooms described as &quot;en-suite&quot; in my time. The staff were really friendly. I wasn't expecting much for breakfast having visited Calfornia over the summer and getting 1/2 a tepid cup of vacuum flask coffee. Again I loved the fact that the coffee and OJ were limitless. Downside cornflakes, tepid whole milk and white toast aren't really my bag. Again if you are travelling on a budget you can't really expect much more."
81,927,"Oct 23 2007 	hostel masquerding as a hotel	this place was clean and my room was recnently refusbished, with new bathrooms paint and carpet.there is no elevator so if you have luggage this can be an issue.i booked a double room with ensuite so i didnt have to share.the location is very good, just 5 minutes walk to bayswater or about 7 minutes to queensway tube stationswould reccomend if travelling on a budget"
82,927,"Oct 10 2007 	Even for inexpensive place it should be better	After all the reviews Ive seen, I still decided to go for it  I could not find online any other place within this price range. Even though the location is very convenient  close to the touristy shopping areas, Hyde Park and the Tube stations I would forgo it for the better accommodations.Warning! If you traveling with a lot of luggage, the place does NOT have an elevator. We had to haul our bags to the 4th floor (which is actually 5th). Staircases are so narrow and steep and we had to watch our steps very carefully (even without luggage) to do not stumble downThe room was a size if a closet with one bank bed. It did not even have a chair (and there probably was not enough room for one) to sit to put on shoes  the top bank was too low so that it is very uncomfortable to sit hunching on the bottom bank. We each got only one towel which they never changed for 4 nights. The sheets had holes, but looked clean although the colors were kinda odd. And they provided one little soap bar only at the check-in, and I never saw another soap after this was gone. So if you are thinking to stay there bring your own soap and shampoo.The floor carpet was old and spotty.Some toilets did not flash and the some showers did not have a changing compartment. So you are wet and naked have to open the shower door to get to your towel and clothes while someone can be passing by.However, I glimpsed into other rooms, and some of them seem much better  newer and lighter and cleaner. So never know what you getBreakfast was very limited. They offer corn flakes cereal only, milk, toasts and tiny packs of jams (three varieties). They only had toasts of white cheap bread, did not even offer whole wheat. Coffee from a coffee machine, and OJ from a machine.And the construction is still going on!The good part was that I did not have to spend much time there  leave farely early and come back late.Even if you are on a tight budget, you might want to reconsider for 20 more pounds/ night a better accommodation."
83,927,"Sep 17 2007 	Clean and pleasant surroundings	After reading some of the reviews for London Hotels, I was more than a little wary of what to expect. Our double room on the second floor was a little smaller than others I've seen but clean, fresh and very presentable. If what you are looking for is a convenient, inexpensive base in London, this is very suitable. Away from the main road, the rooms are quiet and the front overlooks a central garden. It is a short walk to the Bayswater and Notting Hill underground which adds to the convenience. The bathroom was modern and spotless and I was very surprised when we came back to find out towels had been changed and the bed made - more than I'd expect from a hostel! The front desk staff are very helpful - we were given extra pillows as soon as they were requested and there is a handy internet area just off the reception.There is evidence of some refurbishment going on which made the stairs look a little messy but not an inconvenience to us. There is a kettle in the rooms but no tea/coffee etc so remember to bring your own. All in all it added to a wonderful stay in London and I would recommend it."
84,927,Sep 10 2007 	No exchange of towels or bedsheets for 4 nights!	I booked the hotel for relatives and the double room was tiny and they put a very awful rotten flatable 3rd bed in. The room was spotless clean and newly re-done with a small flatscreen TV on the wall and two twin beds despite the fact we booked a double room with a 3rd bed. Bathroom was ensuite with a shower only but as well newly re-done and clean.It was disappointing that the bedding sheets were were outworn and not changed once in 4 nights neither did they get any towels replaced. After complaining they were advised that the bedding sheets get only changed every 6 nights!Location wise it is fine - quiet side road and in walking distance to Bayswater and even Queensway Tube Station.If you only stay for a couple of nights and want a clean small quiet room than it should be ok. But if you stay longer then you are better off staying somewhere else unless you want to sleep in the same bedding sheets and keep using the same towels for 6 day/s/nights!
85,927,"Jul 19 2007 	Good location 	We stayed at the London House Hotel on our way back from Greece. It is in a good location not far from the Bayswater tube station in a very quiet, residential neighborhood. The hotel has a little bit more of a &quot;hostel&quot; feel to it, but we stayed in a double room with an en suite bathroom and had a great experience. When we checked in, there were lots of younger looking people in the lobby and construction workers running around. The hotel is doing lots of renovating so parts of it look very old and torn up (ie: old paint and carpet). I was a little hesitant when we started up to our room, but we were on one of the floors that had been completely re-done. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we were the first people to stay in this room. There was still sawdust in the corners. It was big for London hotel rooms, had a brand new flat screen tv, new furniture and a beautifully tiled (and spotlessly clean) bathroom. My only issue was with the outlets in the room (they were numerous - amazing) but my adapter plug didn't fit. One of my prongs was shaped just a little differently. I've used my adapter all over London and never had that problem before. It wasn't a big deal since we were there in the summer and only for one night. Might have been an issue if we were there longer and I had to dress up for something. Other than that, we had a great experience."
86,927,"Jul 3 2007 	Great location and cheap	Great location, in an amazing neighbourhood (Bayswater), and 5 minutes walk to two underground stations (Bayswater and Queensway). Clean rooms, nice people, good price... Maybe the breakfast could be better, but averall, highly recomendable!"
87,927,"May 19 2007 	Both good and bad	We stayed in this hotel for four days at the end of April and again in early May after travelling around England. We had the double ensuite rooms. Both rooms were freshly renovated with nice, new bathrooms (good showers). Beds were comfortable and our rooms looked out over Kensington Square Gardens. In this room you will get a bed, one bedside cabinet with drawers, and one wardrobe. There's also a good, wall mounted TV and an electric jug. No coffee/tea or UHT milk provided.Unfortunately, the second room had ants, so don't leave perishable food out. Speaking of food, breakfast consists of cornflakes, white toast, butter, jams, tea, coffee, juice and milk. It is not healthy food so you might want to get some fresh fruit salad from Tescos or M&amp;S to supplement breakfast.You can wash and dry your clothes in self-service machines which are through a mini labyrinth of doors and corridors.There's nowhere to sit other than the bed so it's not a place for staying put for long. The staff are friendly, but not very helpful. Most are not native English speakers. In fact, the hotel seemed more like a European youth hostel so you'll hear a lot of German and French but not much English. There are a few internet PC's in the foyer which is really handy. The hotel is in a brilliant location, really close to a mall with M&amp;S supermarket. It's only a few minutes walk from both Bayswater and Queensway stations and Hyde Park. Although it's a really touristy area, it's well situated for transport.Overall, it was a convenient place to stay and not too expensive for London. Have a good trip!"
88,927,"Apr 8 2007 	Safe Inexpensive and Great Location!	My sister and I went to London to see LONDON, not to spend time in our hotel room. If you simply need a place to sleep and shower, this is a great hotel! We both agreed that we definitely want to stay here again when we go back! I hope the little list below shows you that the good points about this place outweigh the &quot;bad news.&quot;GOOD NEWS1. INEXPENSIVE: about $80/night. That's the cheapest you will find this close to the smack center of London without having to stay in a hostel!2. SAFE: 2 minute walk to Baywater Station and not scary to be about in this area at night. Plus the locals were friendly. Someone right outside of Bayswater Station helped us find our hotel. If you don't know where Bayswater is -- it's under 20 minutes (on the underground) from anything you will want to see in London!3. CLEAN: Newly refurbished (new carpet, new tile in the bathroom), heater, dresser, TV. We felt safe walking barefoot on the carpet. The bathroom was perfectly clean and they cleaned it everyday when we were out (it costed a little more for a private bathroom, but we didn't want to have to share). And yes the bathroom was small, but so were ALL the restrooms in London! That's how it is in Europe.4. SERVICE: They gave us answers to our questions when they had them, if they didn't we found someone else. (*The train station attendants are VERY knowledgable!)5. INTERNET: one pound will get you 30 min. Not bad I thought. I only wanted to update the unlucky suckers back home about all the fun they were missing!BAD NEWS1. BREAKFAST: their continental breakfast only includes toast (w/butter and jam), cornflakes, milk, coffee and orange juice. We were greatful to be able to save that much more each day, but after a week, we were sick of it *shrug*2. CONSTRUCTION: they were having construction when we were there, but it didn't interfere with our stay in any way. It didn't smell like paint or wood chips. We never heard them hammering or cutting -- we were in our room between 9 and 11p everynight and out of our room by 9am every morning, so at least they never did any banging and hammering between those hours."
89,927,"Apr 1 2007	i dislike this hostel	Hi... I stayed in this hostel from 22 to 31 March of 2007with 3 more friends.The room was horrible,too old and not clean.The walls were broken and humid.we stayed 9 nights and they did not change our sheets and towels.Internet access was not free and too expensive.i will not recommend it to anyone."
90,927,"Mar 23 2007 	Lovely Stay	We stayed at the London house hotel for six nights in March 2007. We had a triple room en-suite (with private bathroom). The room was fairly small, but we were in an excellent location. This hotel is very convenient to the Tube, bus lines, and Hyde Park. Upon our arrival the hotel management was very apologetic that we could not check in early, even though we arrived at 12 pm, two hours prior to check in. They let us store our luggage though while we ventured out. The breakfast was a standard English breakfast with toast, cereal, coffee, tea, and milk. Also, we asked for an adapter to use for our hair dryer and a pot to warm hot water in our room. On the last two days, we even asked to have a small breakfast ready for 6 am, and the supervisor provided this for us at the front desk. Francessca was great, and the staff was very pleasant and accomadating. Again this hotel is a wonderful buy for London and in a wonderful location. I had no complaints at all. Also, internet service is available for a small fee in the lobby."
91,927,"Feb 2 2007	Serious health and safety issues!	How many years has this hotel been doing works while they have guests stay there?Last November I was outside this hotel with a group of fellow guests. we were about to leave for a day out. We heard a loud crash of glass as one of the windows in an upstairs rooms was smashed by a workman. Two people in uniform were walking past, at the time and the pieces of glass landed on one of them.No one came out of the hotel to see what was happening to her.You could see she was very shook by what happened.the men upstairs carried on working even though they knew that someone could be very hurt out side.No body came to see if we hotel guests were okay either. we had been some feet away and could have been hit too. I still wonder what happened to that woman who got covered in glass that morning!"
92,927,Jan 29 2007	Cheap Nice Great Location!	This is a great hotel if you are not looking for luxury. It is perfect for college students or budget travellers. No elevator. The staff is friendly and the rooms are fine. Good breakfast and internet service. Lots of fun.
93,927,"Nov 19 2006	Crappy	We booked a twinroom with private bathroom at this hotel. Our room arrangement was definitely not designed by sensible people. The beds were lousy and one of the beds was so close to the bathroom, that the bathroom door jammed on the side of the bed when it was open..very cramped!! Wallpaper was torn different places and only one lamp in the ceiling lit the room up. We woke op every morning 7:45 and 8:00 by workmen/dekorators(which is a shame to use the word in this case). It wasn*t worth the effort of going down all those stairs to the basement to have breakfast! Staff were indifferent and halvhearted to help. The place is not recommendable for people with a disability as there is no lift but lots of stairs. The bathroom was so and so but the running water was either burning or icecold. Whatever happened to putting up shelves so guests can have at least their hairbrushes/toothbrushes on them?? Toiletries have to stay in the bag, or on top of the water closet!! And hooks to hang towels on?????On the positive side: the view from our the window and the location of the hotel. Would I stay here again or recommend it to any one? ABSOLUTELY NOT."
94,927,"Nov 18 2006 	Good good location	London is a place you are grateful for any normal accomodation so I knew already what to expect.In a room call single were bunk bed, clean enough, no tv, but mirror, sink and teapot. Toilet in a next door. Reconstruction was going but they start from 7.45am only. Breakfest - bread, instant coffee etc.Modest but ok, for easy going and not spoiled.Location is most there!"
95,927,"Nov 11 2006 	Great hotel! .. not so great constructionm :(	We would have rated them an EXCELLENT but they put us in the room that was next to the new addition they were putting onto the hotel. We made our reservation 7 months in advance, but we still were the only room in this construction area. Other than the 7:45 wake ups with jackhammers and power drills, the hotel was REALLY nice. It is right behind a mall and along the main drag in Bayswater. Great restaurants all around it, and close to the Tube! Ask the desk and they will help you out! Also there's free internet in the hotel and we gfound wireless reached our room too!"
96,927,"Oct 21 2006 	Not great	The place is Ok, still pretty expensive. Internet slow service slow, Rooms were pretty good, clean but the shared bathrooms were terrible. The drain in the shower didnt drain the water but the toilets Ok. All in all ordinary and overpriced."
97,927,"Oct 12 2006 	Very recommendable!	Because we had already some bed accperiance with London Budget Hotels, we were really ?afraid? of this Hotel. But we were surprised!Ok, we also payed a bit more than before, but it was still a good price (90GBP/person/3nights/double en-suite).Me and my friend stayed in the room 702; we reserved a twin ensuite , which was on the day of arrivel not free, so we got a family room, which was really nice. Very clean - accept the blue bedchlothes could be washed fresh!, a lot of furniture,very modern TV:),and the bathroom was also very nice nad clean.The breakfast was good and for me very important: a clean dining room! The stuff was friendly, but we didnt use their help for going around,beause we already stayed in London for several times.But the best is the location!"
98,927,"Sep 20 2006 	I got robbed!!!	I was originally planning on staying at this hostel for 2 nights. It's cheap and located in a somewhat decent area. But during my first night there, while I was sleeping, someone came into my room and stole my camera (with all of my pix from my Euro-trip), all of my cash (even my coins), and my credit card, all from my backpack! I told the staff about this, and they couldn't do a thing about it. They only had security cameras in the reception area, not in the hallways. And they didn't really do anything to help me out, even though I was penniless! They just directed me to the nearest police station. It really ruined my first impression of London, but I guess if you're bunking with unknown people in a cheap hostel, you're gonna have to expect some risks. Beware of the crazy people that are staying there, and make sure to safeguard your belongings! Other than that, the beds are ok to sleep on, you get a free towel and soap, and there are different types of showers on different floors... pick the ones that are cleaner and actually have a door. Breakfast is very dull there. I suggest going out and buying a &quot;real&quot; English breakfast."
99,927,"Aug 2 2006 	its ok if you need somewhere cheap	I stayed here for a couple of nights because it was the cheapest available room in a convenient location. And the location is great - its in a quiet street, but in Bayswater which is a great suburb - lots of nice cheap food, walking distance to Hyde Park, and very well serviced by public transport. The beds and rooms are fine, my room had its own sink which was good. The showers and bathrooms felt a little seedy (there was no shower head, just a fawcett pouring out water and the floor seemed to be always covered in an inch of water. The staff arent overly friendly, but its cheap, and while its not nice, its fine if you need somewhere cheap."
100,927,"Jul 6 2006	Worst ever accomadation	I have never stayed in accomadation as bad as London House. I stayed in london house for eight nights, the kitchen was not suitable for one person letalone 3. The staff cleaned our room when we told them not to. Our room was left unlocked after cleaning.The staff excluding one said one they would do something but would not follow it through.I would never or could not recommend any one staying at London House."
101,927,"Jun 25 2006	Not again	I stayed at this hostel with my couple and two more friends in April 2006 for three nights. We booked here cosI have lived in Notting Hill for a couple of years before and knew that its location was great so it was the price. We didnt expect too much as we knew that for that price you couldnt find not much in London but when we arrived we soon noticed why was it. Nothing to do with the photos they show in the web. That time, they seemed to be refurbishing some rooms and common areas as we saw some building materials as we went throug a narrow corridor to get the luggage room. Hope it was just while they finish they work as it was tiny, bad illuminated, dirty and mouldly inside. We manage to leave our lugagge and leave for a sighseeing til the check in time came. The reception staff (two guys) seemed to laugh at us when we asked to check the room before staying in it but they agreed to do so. My friend and I were shocked just at the first floor with an sticky-floor toilet with the flush running constantly but still not as clean as it should be. The stairs are narrow and carpeted as its usual in all the Victorian houses around there but these were old and very bad mantained, not safe enough is you are not full fitted or a bit tired when you come back. Our room was on the top floor (4th i may remember) and it smelled so strong as they had just finished to paint the walls. The front door of the room where cracked and thin. Inside the room (it was a four bed mixed with shared facilities) we found 2 pair of bunk beds, an old and small wardrobe and a basin with a mirror an a shaver light at the top. The window didnt close properly but the temperature was no bad as we were lucky with the weather and the hostal kept warmth inside. The matresses were old and unconfortable, so thin, as they were the pillows. The sheets were also so much used and washed but still clean, no problem. The basin basic but clean for it purpose. The carpet was stained and not vaccummed for ages. Then the most impressive thing: The common toilets. They were flooded (inside them and also on the floor) and blocked with toilet paper and I-dont-want-to-know-what-else and the flushes running everytime with no success in keeping them clean. The so called showers were just two pannels to separate the space, with faulty lockers (I must say that the manteinance-man was quick to try to solve and fix the problem) and a water pipe inside with the water running directly onto the floor. The panne dividing the showers dindnt reach the floor so you could get your feet (please carry flip-flops!) full of the bubbles and dirty water of your shower mate in the cabin next to yours. The breakfast was another thing that surprised us but this time possitively. Nothing special but at least very well attended for the room staff that were attentive and they kept the room in good condition. Not too much space but at least brand new and clean which is what we would like to be the rest of the hostel. I guess you can surf the internet for free although we didnt use that service. Again it looks to be a very basic hostel for backpackers that dont mind too much about the place itself and just want to have a rest for a while. Nor for parents, not for anyone a bit scrupulous, not for disabled, not for couples, not for kids. Even though, great location in a very safe and nice neighbourhood close to shops, restaurants, parks, tube station, bus stops and main top attractions in London. And must say that the last day as we collected our luggage (that they kindly kept for till late in the night) we saw by an open door one room which seem to be already refurbished and looked pretty nice all brand new, clean and spotless...nothing to do with our one!"
102,927,Jun 10 2006	It was nice	i read the reviews here after I allready booked a room and decided to give it a chance and not only i was not disapointed I was surprize to find out that I didnt find most of the things mentioned in the oter review. Is not amazing but for the price I paid I sure got nice clean accommodation. I stayed in a double room with shower and toilet and it was realy ok. very basic but clean and I saw the team of cleaners every day they tidy my room and when I asked for changing the towels I got new fresh towels imidietly.The staff at the breakfast and at the receprion was friendly and helpfull.It was an ok experience. The only thing is that they were making renovation downstairs so you might here some building noise during the day time but that means soon it will be better.
103,927,"Jun 7 2006	Deplorable	This hotel is hotel is unclean and has staff that complains bitterly of its poor wages. The toilets do not flush, and there is an insect problem that left red welts upon my leg. Although the manager claims that pest control has inspected and there is nothing.. The only redeeming quality is that is in a good location and there is free internet, but down the street there are at least 5 other hotels!! I suggest staying in one of those, such as the Phoenix."
104,927,"May 31 2006	Disgusting	I don't know what kind of standards the people who liked this place have, but I was utterly disgusted with this hostel, and checked out the very next day. There was no elevator, construction is going in the hallway before you get upstairs, the rooms have no TV, phone, or chair, 1 long window in my single had no curtain (the view was the top of some building with trash and an old barbeque), it was cold, there's only 1 phone to share in their hallway, and though there is free internet, there are only 6 computers, so if they are filled you might as well bring your own laptop. The staff charges for you to use an adapter to plug things up, the toilets are located in random areas, and I was surprised to see a toilet...filled with....stuff...that would not flush. When I went to find a better toilet, it was full of either vomit or pee and the window above the toilet has huge broken gashes. If you can live in anything for a few days, then go for it, because the location is good and it's cheap, but if you appreciate simple, at least half-clean standards for the few days you are vsiting an area, don't book here."
105,927,"Apr 30 2006	Terrible and noisy	I went there to visit London, we stayed 5 nights and 3 on 5 nights were terrible, there was a group of teenagers next to our room, because some group from school go to hostel, be aware because they are very noisy! ask before booking if they host school group at the hotel. The room was very small, the bunk bed were not comfortable, I even slept on the floor, the wall are so thin, I slept with ear plug for the 5 nights, (they saved my trip) not even a chair in the roome so we have to stand...I went to other hostel in the world and this one was the worst, The location was great , nice area...but thats it! the breakfast was ok, some toast and jam, the shower didnt had a door, so anyone cam come in and look at you! be carefulthe staff was ok."
106,927,"Mar 29 2006	Even for a hostel this was pretty bad	We've camped, gone luxury and done the hostel thing, so we're not terribly picky, but this was, frankly, a bit gross. The beds were clean and housekeeping did a nice job of making them each day.The room was musty and the floors felt &quot;soft.&quot; Seriously. When you walked, the floor seemed to give and be a bit squishy. In part, this was probably due to the sticky, unclean carpet. I don't know the origin of the stickiness, nor do I want to.The bathroom did not have a working light, so for four days we showered by the light of the flashlight my ever-prepared Scoutmaster husband had packed. Each day, we notified the front desk attendant of the problem, and each day we were cheerfully assured that it would be fixed. At least they were pleasant when they disregarded us.Very dodgy clientele, even by hostel standards. The advertised internet was slow, but workable.Would never go back under any circumstances."
107,927,"Mar 28 2006	This place is disgusting	Everything was dirty. there aren't toilets on every floor. None of the &quot;shower rooms&quot; had doors so I was freezing every time i took a shower. it took forever for the water to get hot and when it finally did, i had to keep playing with the taps so the water wouldn't scald me. the carpet was filty, the room was dusty and there was a piece of the wall missing. yes, that's right, a piece of the wall missing. further more, there was a hole in the floor covered up with carpet. And the room was freezing. I had to keep complaining to the front desk every half hour before they did something."
108,927,"Dec 23 2005	clean and nice but...	we reserved a dorm for 6 females with no ensuite bathroom and had the nice surprise to have it for 4 and with shower and wash bassin..the hostel was clean as well as the rooms, the bed was made every day and we had towels and soap. The shower was in the middle of the room and there was no hot water at all in the room,rooms were not soundproof. The hostel develops on 4 floors and there is no lift. Stairs are very small and steep. The toilet as already told are not in the rooms but there are oher two zones with beds that I haven't seen. We were staying at the third floor, and had to go to fourth floor for toilets, only two for all the floors....!!!!..Breakfast consisted in sluces of corn flakes,bread, jam and butter and something to drink(orange juice, tea, cold milk, black coffea...). Internet access was free,five Pc, fast connection..but sometimes to wait. I would surely stay there again, but wouldn't carry heavy luggages nor book a room without ensuite bathroom..."
109,927,"Oct 10 2005	I loved it	I don't know why this place got so many bad reviews. I stayed here for 5 days and I thought it was great. The staff was very friendly, with the exception of one person, but I eventually got him to mellow out and I was on good terms with him by the time I left. Their rooms are mixed (males and females in the same room). But I already knew that when I reserved my room, so it didn't bother me. Then again, I also got lucky in terms of who my roommates were. Their breakfasts are good. It's cereal, toast, and orange juice. Their Internet is free from 9 a.m. until I'm not sure what time. Their bathrooms and rooms were clean. The showers had hot water. I take long showers so I think their water heaters are very good. It's comfortable, and not loud. Although I guess it depends on what sort of people are staying in the rooms next to yours. The location is great. There's a neat shopping center a few steps away, and it's a short walk away from Queensway and Bayswater stations. There's a lot of neat shops and restaurants in the area and it was very safe. I'm definitely staying here again next time I'm in London."
110,927,"Jul 10 2005	Not that bad	I stayed with a friend at London House Hotel in april 2005 for three days and I must say that I found it to be okey. It wasn't the nicest hotel but for the price (we payed 20/night and person) it was good. The downsides was the slightly bad smell in the room and the breakfast. Besides that we didn't have any complains, the personel was nice and helpfull, the location is good and for the price it was actually quite good.I've stayed in two different hotels in London before and they were much nicer but also 2-3 times more expensive. So the next time I'll go to London I will consider London House Hotel. At least if I go with friends not if I go with my parents or girlfriend. If you're looking for a cheap hotel at a good location I can recommend this hotel. You get pretty good value for you're money in my opinion."
111,927,"Jul 1 2005	It was better in the olden days....	I have stayed at the London House Hotel several times over the past ten years. But never again. The rooms are overpriced and staff and management extremely rude and ignorant, not to say lazy. This was in November. We had booked a twin room with shower but without bathroom. It was really cold and the radiator wasn't working. I had to sleep with my coat on for three nights - even though we notified the reception already on day one that it was freezing. I left a glass of water on the set of drwers next to the window over night - in the morning the water was frozen.After three nights they finally fixed the radiator but since the radiator was squashed in right behind the bed we feared that the bed linen was going to catch fire.When we complained about having to sleep with our clothes, mittens and scarves on the manager was very rude and denied any knowldge about it.The shower in the room was impossible to use, when trying to use it it flooded over the wall-to-wal carpet and it took days for the carpet to dry.Still.. I suppose it could be okay for a hostel - but it is not a Hotel."
112,927,"Jun 4 2005	Terrible Place	Do not ever stay at this place. When I arrived the staff was very rude. They made me wait half an hour just to get checked in. When I reserved the room it was for a room on the first floor and it was an all girls room. When I arrived they placed me on the top floor (no elevator, so you must climb the stairs with your luggage). I was also placed in a room with men, which I did not approve of. When I tried to switch they wouldn't let me and told me they were all full. This was unbelievable considering I had reserved my room 4 weeks earlier. Such poor service! The worst part of this hostel was how dirty it was. My sheets must not have been changed before I arrived. I picked up scabies from the bed I slept in at this place. Let me tell you, after all the medical bills I had to pay due to the disease I got at this place I wish I would have just payed a few extra pounds to stay in a nicer hotel in London. This place should not be called a hotel. It is definitely a hostel, and the worst one I have been at in fact. The showers are also extremely cold and there was no toilet paper or soap in the bathrooms down the hall. The only thing good at this place was the free internet in the morning, but even then you would sometimes have to wait forever just to get on the computer. Save yourself the agony and stay at a better place."
113,927,"Apr 10 2005	Not as shocking as expected	After reading the reviews at this page, I faced my easter-vacation with mixed feelings. Overjoyed of the fact that I was going to LONDON, but at the same time worried about me being alive after a week at this horrible hostel! When we got there, I got one pleasent surprise after another. The lobby was small, but nice, and the personal really helpful. We got a room in the third floor, with both toilet and shower (which I was really happy about), and was provided with soap and clean towels whenever we needed it. The breakfast was like expected. Toast, jam and coffee. If you would prefer a better breakfast, there's a lot of shops and cafs just around the corner. And that's what makes this hotel so great, it's in the center of everything you need, with the subway just around the corner. For that small amount of money, this is more than you can expect."
114,927,"Feb 28 2005	Worst Weekend	My stay at this hotel (hostel) was a great disappointment. The rooms were dirty and well worn. The carpet was peeling from the wall and the walls and ceiling were badly stained. Workmen were painting down the stairs, right opposite my door. The paint smell lasted all weekend, and because the ironing board was down there I got paint all over my clothes luckily I washed it out in time. They had been painting next to the kitchen and dining area and had not even ventilatde the rooms. The first morning I had to climb four sets of stairs to the shower which turned out to be two cubicles in an open box room with no ventilation. The shower window was dirty and the shower was weak. I had to balance on a wooden board while the water went dangerously hot and cold. We even had to go to the toilet outside of the room. The furniture was two cot beds and battered old wardrobe, dressing table and sink unit. If you don't mind an extremely rough stay this would be the place for you, but I have never been so disappointed. This place should not even be classed as a hotel, it is a hostel."
115,927,Feb 13 2005	what a piece of crap!
116,927,"Feb 13 2005	Nothing is less true	When I went to London with my study I was shocked by reading the review that were writen about this hostel... But when arrived in the nice and clean hostel everything was different; the beds were clean, we had a private shower and toilet with four of us, towels and soap were provided. The breakfast was not extremely great, but it was good; what would you expect for the money? The matrassess were a bit old, but good enough to sleep on after a few pints.  5 out of 5 starts; there's no place where you get this service for such less money."

1,930,Nov 1 2009 	Great Hotel	The entire experience was perfect. From the size and cleanliness of the room to the restaurant where we ate breakfast every morning to its great proximity to the underground subway and other sights! The hotel staff and personnel were always helpful and willing to do what we needed. I'm telling this hotel was beautiful and comfortable!
2,930,"Oct 18 2009 	Comfortable hotel good location	On some trips I like to stay at chain hotels for the comfort of the familiar. This trip was booked with Marriott points. This was my second time at this hotel. The room had 2 double beds and was quite spacious for a European hotel.The overall decor was very unobtrusive, the room clean, the staff nice and friendly. Breakfast buffet was included with our room, lots of choices. The lobby bar was funky and relaxing. Overall, nice atmosphere.There is a Sainsbury across the street from the hotel. Hotel was about a 5 min walk from Gloucester Road tube, lots of cafes and shops in the area. About 10/15 minute walk in opposite direction to Earl's Court tube."
3,930,"Oct 10 2009 	Great Stay In A Beautiful Residential Area	Had six nights in October. Absolutely loved the hotel and the area. Hotel is on a busy road so we asked for a room in the back - no problems with noise at all. Typical Marriott furnishings and wonderful bedding (although the feather bed was hurting a little compared to other Marriotts). Fully functioning AC and heat - you may need both in the same stay this time of year! Spotless bathroom with great water pressure and hot water in the shower. In room coffee, tea, hot chocolate and biscuits. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful with travel options in London and beyond - don't be surprised if the staff you meet remember your name the next time you see them. High speed internet is pricey at 15 pounds, but is the fastest connection we've ever had in Europe. Gym is a little small, but Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens aren't too far for a jog. Sainsbury (grocery store) right across the street - excellent muffins and croissants for breakfast and pre-made sandwiches and salads saved us tons of money on lunches. There is also a self-laundry on the same block if you're on an extended trip. Walk to Glouchester Rd Underground Station is 5-10 minutes along Cromwell Rd - you can get most places using Piccadilly, Circle, and District Lines from there. More fast food, grocery stores, newsstands, and pubs by the station. Harrod's V&amp;A, National History Museum, etc. are all in easy walking distance. Just a great hotel that I can't wait to stay in again - feel like you're in a real residential part of London, excellent rooms and staff, and easy access to all tourist attractions!Have a great stay in London!"
4,930,"Sep 25 2009 	We were treated like family--what great service!	We recently spent 7 nights at this hotel in Kensington. The staff was extremely helpful to us in planning our visit (Ron the concierge is the best!). They arranged for private transport from Heathrow (and worried about us when our plane was delayed), knew just who we were when we arrived, upgraded us to a beautiful king bed room (loved that bed, it slept so good), treated us to an elaborate breakfast buffet every day and a very nice executive lounge. The staff everywhere was friendly, attentive--we felt very much at home. It was a short walk to the tube, and the bus stopped right in front. Now granted, we were Platinum Level Rewards Members using points to stay--but I give my vote for favorite place to stay to these folks!"
5,930,Sep 21 2009 	Too cramped and hot	Small room with no way of turning down the heat - even in January the place was like an oven. Badly designed room though as usual with a Marriott the reception was fine.Better value elsewhere and not up to Marriott standards.
6,930,"Sep 9 2009 	Great location good value has seen better days but well kept and really clean	We stayed for a romantic London weekend in September'09 at the Marriott Kensington Hotel, since we got a good 3 nights for the price of two offer.The hotel is very well situated 5-10 minutes walk away from Gloucester Road tube station, and a nice stroll away from the Victoria &amp; Albert/Natural History/Science Museums, Harrod's Knightsbridge and Hyde Park.The building and decor have seen better days and are quite old fashioned, but everything is in good condition and spotlessly clean. Rooms are on the smallish side, at leas for the double we had, but it is London after all.Breakfast was nice although not as good as some other Marriotts I've stayed in, and service was well trained, attentive and nice.We would go back again, in fact I am next week!"
7,930,"Aug 12 2009 	Nice hotel. Service is not bad but.... peculiar	I have stayed here many, many times due to my frequent business travel to London. I sometimes would be at this hotel for 8 nights in a row. I do like the location which is walking distance to Chelsea, not your typical tourist area. The rooms were nice &amp; clean, tho rather small, but hey, it's London! Room service good. The gym is not large, but it's clean, &amp; to be honest, who really works out on the road? No matter what time I went (daily), I was often the only person there. Overall service is good to great. Front Desk/Concierge is a fun group of International people &amp; they were always helpful (or really tried their best). But, this is what puzzles me: I am at Marriott Member (higher level), &amp; as I said, I stayed here many times ...and I never seen a place so oversold. Meaning, MANY MANY times, upon arriving to check in, I was told: &quot;Sorry, we are oversold &amp; we are taking you to another property&quot;. Granted they paid for the night, the transportation was not comped. This happened SO many times that it had become a running joke among the staff and I. Every time I would arrive I never knew if there was a room or not. Why do i mention this here? Because IF I got &quot;walked&quot; as much as I did, &amp; I am a Marriott High Points member that stays here all the time....what will happen to any guest/customer who maybe stays here just once? It seems as the planning/management of the facility is totally random."
8,930,"Aug 11 2009 	This place is notorious among many Marriott Rewards members I know...	...as one of the worst Marriott hotels in terms of service. Some staff are helpful and responsive, but most desperately need a crash-course in basic customer relations, and can't be bothered with even the most simple requests. I've stayed at this hotel three times due to convenience bookings among several groups of colleagues, and we all joke about the poor service. As a Platimum Marriott Rewards member who stays in Marriott hotels around the world on business, I'll say that the basics - clean rooms and linens, operable phone and Internet, security - are all provided here. But apparently the hotel management is depsperate enough to cut costs that they've made that the obvious priority among the staff, and it's almost comical. A camera on the honor bar in the concierge lounge? Are you kidding me? Even with that in place, they have staff patrolling the lounge, distributing honor bar tab tickets to everyone present. And then a manager accosting people as they left, a stack of honor bar tickets in his hand. Tiny amounts of food at the buffett are replaced very infrequently during meal times...and all the while you can catch a glimpse of the staff in the prep area, standing next to full trays of this food, watching the clock, while a room of hungry, loyal Marriott customers waits (they can use this time to fill out their honor bar tabs, I suppose). Are you kidding me, Marriott? Simply shut down the concerige lounge if you're losing so much money, folks. I'm pretty sure you're defeating the entire purpose with this insulting behavior - and the message your corporate management intends to send to your Elite membership."
9,930,"Aug 10 2009 	A very disappointing stay	We booked at the MK as it seemed to be reasonably close to the Albert Hall and Kensington Park, as we were going to a Prom and also to see Peter Pan in the Park.We have stayed at Marriott hotels quite often and could usually rely on them to be up to a minimum acceptable standard.When we arrived we were told that the air conditioning was being replaced and so there was none. We were told that the room we had booked, an exec which tend to be that little bit bigger than the standard, had windows that could not be opened and so we could stay there and they would let us have a couple of fans. We asked to see the room and as soon as we entered you could feel how hot it was. So we were then shown a standard room which we were told had windows that opened. Although much smaller, we were happy to accept this on the basis we could get some fresh air (and they offered to reduce the cost). However on going up to the room having checked in, we found the window had been screwed shut. But they did then agree to move us to another standard room on the ground floor which had a window that we could open - I assume the windows on the higher floors are screwed shut in case someone tries to jump out through the 2 inches or so that they open! They were very pleasant about sorting it out, but it would have been nice to have been advised the air con was not working in advance (they said it had been out for a couple of weeks) so that we could have booked elsewhere.Apparently part of their problem was that the hotel is built over the tube and so they cannot get a big enough crane onsite to do some of the work. The District and Circle line were actually suspended over the weekend for engineering works. This was a nuisnace for guests as it limited transport options, but from the evidendce of the noise on Monday morning when service was resumed, it was a good thing as the trains are quite audible in the ground floor rooms.The housekeeping was not up to the expected standard - there appeared to be some items missing that we would have usually found and also the replenishment of the tea and coffee was not done well - all decaf coffee and none of the real stuff. I managed to catch the maid along the corrider and asked if we could have some proper coffee, and she solved our problem by swapping our decaf with some from the room she had just cleaned - apologies to the guest who had that room if they wanted proper coffee!This might just be the fact that we had been &quot;downgraded&quot; to a standard room or might be a sign of these tough times -if so, why do they persist on putting in new shampoo etc. when they have been barely used?Breakfast was no more than OK - the bacon was hard, either from being overcooked or left too long, there were no fried eggs on one morning and the scrambled egg looked particularly unappetising.The best bit about the hotel was the club sandwich and bottle of wine we had after the performance.Finally, there was no guest questionnaire - we wonder whether we will be sent one by email to complete - but maybe they have been removed from the rooms as a damage limitiation exercise so that head office do not have any feedback from guests on their less that acceptable standard. We will be looking for a way of giving feedback direct to Marriott if we are not asked for it."
10,930,"Aug 6 2009 	No air-conditioning?	Just returned from a 3-night stay in London, staying at the Marriott, Kensington. Plus points were the location and the advance room rate, which is pretty cheap.However, there was no air-conditioning in the hotel (yes, the entire hotel) which made for a very uncomfortable 3 nights sleep. Despite the fact that the hotel knew about this problem well in advance of our arrival, there was no communication of this fact until we were checking in. The problem was exacerbated by the fact that our room was TINY. The smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in, in fact. For these reasons, I will not be booking this hotel again.Also, there seems to be very little noise insulation between the rooms and from the outside. We were frequently woken to noise from televisions, and on one occasion, a car alarm - despite the fact that we were on the top (8th) floor."
11,930,"Jul 30 2009 	Perfect Location near restaurants and the tube	We booked our stay here in anticipation of going to opening night of Michael Jackson's concert. I was so sad after the bad news I was sure I wasn't going to have any fun in London at all. I was wrong. This hotel was really upbeat, comfortable, and located in a great part of town for all the good sites. This might sound odd, but the lobby smelled AMAZING. Not your typical fake air freshener type smell, it was so fresh and fragrant I couldn't get enough of it. Grocery across the street was more than convenient. Short walk to the Gloucester Rd stop on the Picaddily line made this super convenient for those arriving at Heathrow. Get the Picaddily line towards Cockfosters (35 mins), get off at Gloucester Rd, exit the stop and walk left, left at intersection, and its about a 5 minute walk. Loved the complimentary iced tea in the lobby. What a welcome sight after long days out sightseeing. Internet connection in the room was next to impossible."
12,930,"Jul 27 2009 	A slightly nicer than usual Marriott	I was relieved to check in to this hotel after a week in several countries/ several different classes of accommodations. They warned me right away that the air conditioning was broken, but it really didn't matter - there was a fan in my room and the windows were open-able, so the room was nice and cool (the hallways were hot, though). I only stayed here one night, but it was a very pleasant stay. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the Gloucester Street underground station, and walkable to the Victoria and Albert Museum and Harrod's."
13,930,"Jul 23 2009 	Great Hotel ... Great Food	Marriott Kensington is a regular haunt of mine when travelling on business and need to be convenient to the Piccadilly or Circle Lines - have choice of Earls Court or Gloucester Road stations.The rooms are small but have everything necessary for the business traveller and are fine for one person. The air-conditioning isn't working at the moment - but the rooms have previously been cool or warm as required depending on the season.The Executive Lounge is good, It has a good selection of food (depending on time of day) and soft drinks, tea, coffee, etc. The only niggle is that it is poorly situated in a sub-ground floor in the middle hotel - so there's no windows - and very poor mobile signal. Executive implies business - and not being able to use the mobile for e-mail is a drawer back. There are two PCs and (unusually) these have printers which is good for printing something that you've forgotten for a meeting or an airline boarding pass.The Restaurant serves excellent steaks - not the cheapest - but excellent quality - and usually the service is just right too. Good room service food too.Reception staff are friendly and helpful.There's a nice small pool to relax. The jacuzzi is not much to comment on - it is a gentle &quot;swish&quot; of water! And watch out for the wet floors.Overall its a hotel that I will continue to use when in this area."
14,930,"Jul 20 2009 	Comfortable reliable and well-appointed	Booking a hotel in London can be tricky once your children reach 16--adulthood by UK standards. Many hotels will not allow 3 &quot;adults&quot; in one room, so you're required to book two rooms. Not so at the Marriott Kensington in London. We were able to stay in one spacious room (our children are 17 and 12) for 289 GBP/night. Booking 2 rooms in comparable hotels would have cost about 25% more. We booked the jr. suite, which is a spacious 500 square feet, complete with 2 queen beds (very comfortable!), a sofa, ample closet space, a roomy and clean bathroom (with 2 sinks, no less!), coffee/tea making facilities, and an American-style electrical outlet. We opted for the executive suite membership, which meant we had access to the executive lounge for breakfast (hearty and healthy and tasty) as well as coffee/drinks/snacks, newspapers, and computer access all day long. While it's tempting to stay in a 'local' hotel when traveling, sometimes going for American comfort and reliability is the way to go! The location may seem a bit removed from the action in London, but it's really quite good--only 3 blocks from 2 major tube stops (Gloucester and Earls Court), a 5 minute walk to the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, 10 minutes walk to tony Kensington High Street and its great shops and restaurants (to the north) or Harrods (to the east), 15 minutes walk to Kensington Palace/Gardens and Hyde Park. As a bonus, across the street from the hotel is a Sainsbury's grocery store and a laundromat; just near the tube stops are several good choices for lunch and dinner (ASK, Paul's, Nando's, and several pubs). We highly recommend this hotel for families who wish to stay together."
15,930,"Jul 19 2009 	Mixed review - good value good location odd services	The reason I say mixed review is that there were some relatively odd bits but overall the experience was good.I stayed here for a long weekend with my 7 year old son. When booking on the web there was no option for a twin room so I went with a double. I rang the hotel the next day to change to a twin and the guy on the phone said no problem . . . but it will cost you an extra 40 per night. Excuse me ? 40 extra just to get a twin bed. But this rate included Executive lounge access. I thought about it and decided that it might just be worth it - for a bit of a treat. The initial rate was something like 125 per night which seemed good for the middle of summer in London. Even though the extra 40 was an extra 30% it still brought it up to a price I would have paid anyway, It just seemed crazy that there was no other way to get a twin room.When we arrived at the hotel I was told that my son wouldn't actually be able to use the executive lounge. Uh-huh . . . so I pay 40 a night so that I can sit in the lounge by myself and he gets to sit in a seperate bed upstairs. I don't think so. Eventually the manager was consulted and agreed that a single small boy was unlikely to go rushing around the lounge and so could use it. Result. But it really felt like a bit of an ordeal to get this far.In the end the lounge was in the basement (I had been hoping for a top floor room with a view of the area) and didn't serve alcohol and also didn't seem to serve food in the evenings. The alcohol wasn't a big issue, but other lounges I have used have had this, so I just kind of assumed it would be the same.As with other reviews here, this hotel is definitely an old one which has had a bit of a make over, rather than a top notch hotel. Out the back of the hotel there is a Premier Inn (or other cheapo chain) which is attached by a bridge across the road, so the two buildings must have been part of the same hotel at some stage.The executive room we had was definitely big - two double beds and the usual weird TV stuck-in-a-cabinet arrangement. I don't like watching TV in a cupboard, but I could live with it. Other than that there's not a lot to say about the room. Based on the floor plan on the door, the other rooms on the floor were definitely smaller so you do benefit from the space.When we got to our room there was a note on the desk saying that the air-con was out and would be till August (a few weeks). They really could have mentioned this when booking in. Luckily it wasn't a particularly hot few days. I would not like to see it in the middle of a hot spell in August.As with other reviews - Earls Court &amp; Gloucester Road (Piccadilly line, good for Heathrow) tube stations are within a few minutes walk. In reality they are just down the road. You can't quite see them from the hotel but only because of a bend in the road. Sainsburys across the road and Waitrose at Gloucester Road are fine for snackage.We used the pool a few times over the days. It's fine - definitely an extra worth considering after a long days walking and getting the tube around London. The showers smelled a bit, but other than that the pool was good.I will be returning later this year with the rest of the family and would be likely to stay here again."
16,930,"Jun 16 2009 	Good location and nice environment	The hotel is clean and well maintained. The walk to the Tube station, as well as the nearby Kensington Palace, is beautiful. The environment is clean and surrounding feels safe. Service wise, the concierge and reception staffs on duty are friendly and helpful. Reasonable response time towards requests. Room and toilet are spacious and clean. The only drawback we had was with the view of the room. Our room was located on the ground floor and the window was facing another window. Internet access is also not free."
17,930,"Jun 14 2009 	HMS Marriott	What disappointed me the most about this hotel is false advertising. The Marriott web site states that the hotel &quot;is the most contemporary of hotels in London&quot; and that it sports a &quot;modern design.&quot; Please. Don't let the picture on the web site fool you. This hotel is essentially a musty old hotel that was acquired by Marriott around 2005 and given a superficial face lift. The face lift consists of a large glass-enclosed atrium and facade that is seen in the pictures. The hotel restaurant is part of the glass-enclosed atrium. Beyond the atrium, there's an old hotel that resembles a tired old cruise ship (hence the title of this review). The corridors are narrow and rather baroque. The rooms are small, and they have a distinctive low-frequency buzz that resembles vibrations from the diesel engines of a cruise ship! We had to try three rooms until we could find one where the vibrations were tolerable. There were no views, nor did we expect any.Despite our disappointment with this &quot;most contemporary of hotels in London,&quot; we had a pleasant stay. The staff were extremely friendly and courteous (especially an Italian chap named Luca who works as the concierge). The location is superb, with a 5-min walk to the Kensington tube station and two major museums. The surrounding area is quite safe and pleasant. A couple of tips: (1) If you have to take a cab to LHR, ask the hotel to arrange it for you (at a 45 GBP fixed price). Otherwise, the metered rate will invariably be higher. (2) If you are Marriott Gold or Platinum, you have an option of having free breakfast at the Concierge Lounge or the restaurant. Go for the restaurant since the restaurant provides an extensive buffet and an omelette station."
18,930,"Jun 12 2009 	A little bit of USA in London	As a major hotel chain, everything is as it should be and there were no hassles at all. The restaurant wait staff are really accomodating. A high-chair-adaptor that mounts on the regular chair could be well adjusted to our 10-month-old's needs.At check-in we were offered the option of a groundfloor room, or 4th floor. We were provided with a child bed in the room. Whether it's the prompt, friendly service and cheery smiles at reception, or the the fat guests waddling around the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet, at the Marriott it feels like you're in St. Louis rather than London. Which can be a good thing if you're my mom, and you don't like surprises; but if you're hoping to take in an authentic British experience, this isn't it. The swimming pool, with the jacuzzi, sauna and steamroom are a better-than-expected delight. During the week from Sunday to Thursday, after 8.00 pm in the evenings the pool is restricted to adults, probably to accomodate the needs of business travellers.The neighborhood is okay, with not much of anything right on your doorstep apart from a big Sainsbury grocery store across the street. If you're willing to walk 7 minutes, you can be either at Glocester Road or Earls Court tube station, which are both bustling areas offering anything you could want, including public transportation. There is a bus stop directly in front of the Marriott that is served by the #74 bus, also. Because the Marriott is a major chain, mainly catering to business travelers during the week, you can get some terriffic weekend bargains at 20% off plus free breakfast, for instance, or stay 2 nights and get the 3rd night free. Etc."
19,930,"Jun 8 2009 	Typical Marriott	Decent hotel in a very good location. Rooms and public areas very much what you'd expect. Bar and restaurant about as bland as all Marriott's.Staff very friendly but pretty young and under trained, as usual with Marriott's."
20,930,May 12 2009 	Great family rooms	We have stayed at the Marriott in Kensington twice and really enjoyed both stays. They have a large Family rooms with 2 double beds and a large sitting area which is nice. The breakfast is really good with a great selection and the staff are always very helpfull. It's only a two minute walk to the underground.A good hotel especially if you are travelling with children.
21,930,"Apr 29 2009 	great location very nice hotel	We recently stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the London marathon. First of all the location is superb with a 5 minute walk to the Tube, 10 minute walk to museums, grocery stores and restaurants nearby. From this hotel we were able to take some long walks into Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, Kensington, Theatre District, but the Tube is handy if you don't like walking. Our room was very spacious with a king bed and a couch. The bathroom was large with double sinks, tub and separate shower. Hot water and towels were very plentiful. Our room was very clean and very quiet. We did have Executive Lounge access which we enjoyed. We were able to pop in there for an afternoon snack, some cold water, juice or soda, newspapers, and free computer access. A breakfast was served in this room also with very liberal times. Arriving from the US, we were allowed to check in that morning and quickly shower and head out the door to take in London. We found all the staff helpful and used them to help us make phone calls about lost luggage and also to negotiate the price of a taxi back to Heathrow. We have stayed in London many times before but never in this area or at this hotel. We will definitely return here for the location and great service. In this hotel, you are close to the city but away from the bustle and noise."
22,930,"Apr 8 2009 	A great place to stay	Stayed here for a weekend to celebrate my 40th.The location was excellent, 5 minutes walk from Gloucester Rd tube station and 10 minutes walk from the Museums.The breakfast was very good, basically eat as much as you like!Room was great for our requirements. It was a good size and very clean."
23,930,"Mar 20 2009 	Great hotel!	I recently booked this hotel through Amex travel - got a good deal with a stay for 2 nights, get 3rd night free promo - average night was about $110. Hotel was very convenient to Gloucester Road tube station - I took the tube from Heathrow right into the city and walked to the hotel, about a 5 minute walk. The hotel was beautiful - I think it must have been recently renovated. Everything was spotless! Room wasn't massive, but very clean. I loved that they had full size bath sheets, not just towels that barely go around you. The hotel is also just a few minutes walk down Cromwell Road to Natural History Museum, Victoria &amp; Albert, and Knightsbridge area for shopping (Harrod's, Harvey Nick's, etc.) The people at the hotel couldn't have been nicer or more helpful - I was able to check in as soon as I arrived (around 11AM). When I arrived, I also realized I had left my credit card at home. My husband was arriving at the hotel later that afternoon, and they still let me check in until he arrived with his credit card."
24,930,"Mar 18 2009 	Not a good experience	This was my fourth stay ar this hotel, and I'm afraid it will be my last.I gave this hotel a very good review a couple of years ago, but it has gone downhill since then.We tried to check in at approx.12 noon, but was told the only room they had was on the ground floor, near the ballroom and they expected it to be noisy as they had a wedding that night (and belive me, it WAS).We decided to leave our bags and come back later to check in.we returned at 3 p.m and was told the room on the ground floor was the only one available. I have high floor room as one of my preferences in my Marriott acount, as well as extra pillows and towels. None of these requests were met.We had no choice but to take the room om the ground floor which is really in the basement. No view, dark and dingy and the room was tiny and I mean REALLY tiny even for London. This room gave me a headache. The bed took up almost the whole room. It was very claustrophobic.Noone offered to bring our bags to the room. We had to actually climb down a narrow staircase (with suitcases) and walk down a long corrodor. The whole thing was very disapointing. Breakfast was included in the rate, but they tried to charge us both mornings.It was a relief to check out. The only good thing was the breakfast which is excellent.Two weeks ago I stayed at the Renaissance Chancery Court and it was lightyears ahead of this hotel. I will be moving my business there and to the Sofitel in the future, as I don't want to experience a tiny room in the basement once again."
25,930,"Mar 18 2009 	Decent 4-star hotel in good location just some minor flaws	I booked this hotel for 123 GBP without breakfast over Marriott's official website, no breakfast included. Check-in was friendly and efficient, although the girl tried a bit too hard to make small talk and flatter me. We arrived at 9.45am and were find out that she had a room which was already ready for us to move into. Turned out to be a rather small room overlooking the back yard, not one overlooking the atrium, as I requested beforehand. It also had one queen bed instead of two single beds, which I had also asked for. That was one of the two things which were slightly disappointing about our stay.The other thing was a malfunction of the code card that opens the door. It just stopped working and I had to go down to the reception three times to get it fixed. Staff did everything they could but still, a brand like Marriott should install robust systems and know how to fix it instantly.We used the leisure club and enjoyed the sauna and the swimming pool. The whirlpool wouldn't start &quot;whirling&quot; though, no matter how hard we pushed the button on the floor next to it. There were some dirty and run-down spots here and there, but overall it's a decent facility.Overall it's a very good hotel, just three minutes from both Earl's Court and Gloucester Road tube stations, about 10 minutes from the Natural History Museum and about 20 minutes from Harrod's. If you get a good rate and maybe even a room upgrade, it's a good choice."
26,930,"Mar 12 2009 	Nice location and within easy reach of attractions	This is a great hotel which stands out from the typical white Kensington buildings. It's nearest station is Gloucester Road which is a few minutes away on foot on a single road. There's a Sainsbury's across the road and a Tesco express near too. It's within walking distance to both Hyde Park and the National History Museum which is well worth a visit (free!)!We stayed for three nights over a weekend in a ground floor room. We didn't hear any noise from other guests or from outside, perhaps because we had the airconditioning on which was a little noisy but we slept through it without it waking us up. The aircon itself worked well :) The mattress was really comfortable (queen's size bed) with lots of feather pillows, which I'm not a fan of personally but I still found them fairly comfortable. The shower worked fine and was quite powerful. Free toiletries everyday - even though we'd just moved them from the sink to the shower :)We stayed room only yet ordered breakfast to our room on a Sunday morning. It was expensive but tasty. My boyfriend had the English Breakfast (17.95) which comes with cereal, and I had the Continental Breakfast (15.95) - a basket of bread, pastries, a mini muffin and jam - which also came with cereal. There is a small charge for having the breakfast brought to your room - I think it was about 2. You choose which time slot you'd like for it to arrive, and if it's late, it's on them. Sadly, it was bang on time!We found the service fine, and not snooty like some other reviews suggest, despite the two of us being students and not remotely dressed posh! The staff are mainly foreign (as in most places in London), I assume due to the ability to speak many languages to cater for other guests. As our train home wasn't till 10pm, we were able to leave our bags with them during the day - using tickets to collect them later.I recommend going to Covent Garden for tea - nice food and area and good entertainment."
27,930,"Feb 23 2009 	Decent but not a real Marriott	Let's start with the pros: good value for money, clean facilities and effecient staff. Let's proceed with the cons: tiny rooms keeping you close to corridor noises, no free wifi, small and cheap bathrooms, 10m long swimming pool and joke of a gym.We booked that hotel for a really low room rate and our stay was pretty decent, do not get me wrong but if you trust the Marriott brand and its 4 star status ytou are up for a disappointment."
28,930,"Feb 16 2009 	~Great Value good quality hotel	the Kensington Marriott is really good value if you book as a Marriott Rewards customer and book a fair way in advance. We thought that around 150 for a deluxe double in central Kensington was pretty good for a weekend away, so we snapped it up! It's the second time we've stayed here and to be honest, it's really new, really clean, very modern and a failsafe - you know what you're getting. The rooms aren't huge, but are really comfortable, lovely beds - only quibble is the air con is a little noisy!Check in staff were really polite and efficient, breakfast is really good lots of choice - apart from they ran out of mushrooms.......All in all, a good choice if you want to get to everything in London, particularly Harrods, Kensington High St, The National History Museum, the V &amp; A, Albert Hall etc - you can walk to them all in 20 mins or less!"
29,930,"Feb 3 2009 	Best Western Camouflaged As A Marriott	Overall: the Marriott brand would benefit much if they sell this hotel to a chain such as Best Western, which is more commensurable with its facilities. We used a 3 for 2 package which came with breakfast (the best thing about the hotel); at some 100GBP per night the rate was ok; a full charge rate would be way overpriced.Pros: the breakfast buffet is great; there is a great selection of foods and they prepare the eggs to order. The concierge were helpful. While the location is way off central attractions, it is a short walk to the tube at Earl's Court which gets you to central areas quite quickly. Cons: If you are into claustrophobic spaces, the rooms will be perfect. Just move the drapes, covering the entire wall, to discover that this glass wall illusion is hiding a tiny window with a perfect prison-view of the backyard. Moving the drapes is not too challenging; indeed, if you just move around the bed you are likely to hit the drapes anyway. Be ready for poorly maintained room facilities; the toilet was constantly leakingthroughout our stay; we tried to ignore it, like the housekeeping staff did, but it was way too noisy. Also, if you want to spend your London time far from the madding crowds, the tourist attractions, the business and shopping districts, this is a perfect location. Aggravations: Be ready for billing errors and denial of the confirmed rates. Get rates confirmation and rules in writing and make sure that your check-in form has these correctly printed. Even this may be insufficient and arbitrary rate changes may occur. If you get hit with such errors, call the front desk and have them deliver a correct bill to your room; otherwise you may spend an hour to check out. Be ready for a 15GBP daily rip-off charges for an Internet connection and for 20% surcharge on changing currency. It is best to avoid these hotel dis-services. You can buy a wireless Internet access from O2 or other phone stores for much less and get much more."
30,930,"Dec 31 2008	Pleasant stay	Our room and bathroom were in very good condition during our recent stay; they seemed to have been recently renovated. However, this hotel's standout is its efficient, professional, and relaxed staff- particularly the breakfast staff. Exec lounge access and breakfast were included in the weekend rate. The hotel is in easy walking distance to the Tube, the Natural History Museum, the V&amp;A, and many restaurants."
31,930,"Dec 1 2008	Absolute gem of a hotel!	Only a short walk from the nearby Gloucester Road tube station we were delighted to see this visually striking hotel, and were even more so when we were upgraded to a superior room free of charge (we were also using marriott rewards). Great, spacious, huge light room, with above average amenities such as free bottled water in the office/tv area and in the bathroom - This water was also restocked each day of our stay. As well as being upgraded free of charge we were also granted free access to the hotel's excellent executive lounge, which served lunch, snacks, dinner and a brilliant buffet breakfast, as well as free soft drinks around the day (which was brilliant after seeing the frankly ridiculous mini bar charges). One minor downside to the hotel was the swimming pool, which was quite small, although seeing as it was near the centre of london this was to be expected.I would certainly recommend this brilliant, architectually stunning hotel to anyone who is wanting to stay in London."
32,930,"Nov 29 2008 	Great for single traveller but average for a Marriott	I recently stayed at the Marriott as I had stayed t Marriotts before and as a smoker it's one of the chains that can still guarantee a smoking room if requested.I am a 33 year old singleton, so wanted a hotel that was in a relatively safe location, and wasn't dissappointed with that aspect at all, surrounding area was very pleasant and lit well, and the rooms and staff at the Marriott all felt very secure also.The rooms were fairly spacious and very clean, and of course the famous Marriott beds were up the their usual big and comfy standard.I had the breakfast in my room on my first morning, but it wasn't worth the 17 that it cost, slightly greasy and a bit tasteless, but had two other evening room service meals that were fairly nice, but still a bit pricey. There is a Sainsburys directly across the road which I suggest you use for snacks and drinks, and save yourself some money.The location is good for a bit of peace and quiet, but just down the road is the Natural History Museum and Harrods is about a 15 to 20 minute walk, you can easily get in to Oxford street etc on the tube (that's if they are running, which they weren't the weekend I was there due to 1 accident on one line and scheduled engineering work on 2 others) Nearest tube is a 5 to 10 min walk."
33,930,"Nov 25 2008 	Excellent Hotel with easy access to the Tube	Very nice location and quite. First room we had didn't have hot water. We were then transferred to an executive room which was much larger with 2 beds and had no issues. The staff was helpful but many of them were &quot;in-training&quot; so they had to double check the information with the supervisor often. The executive lounge was very nice but no windows so no view. Food and drinks were constantly being restocked. Also, the executive lounge had 2 computers with free internet access which was nice to be able to check email. Only a 5-10 minute walk to the underground (Tube)."
34,930,"Nov 24 2008	Great Hotel Great Location	We stayed here for Saturday Night. Chose this hotel after reading the other reviews and because the location is great for the Natural History Museum too. The room was very good, the staff really friendly and helpful. Also to note is that the hotel is extremely quiet as in no street noise or noise from the corridors so a good nights sleep! Although the price of breakfast was extortionate we had it included in our rate, and it was delivered to the room for an extra 2.50 only and was 5*. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others."
35,930,"Oct 15 2008 	Great Staff	The staff at this hotel were so helpful. Very friendly, very happy to help, always cheerful. Really, they made my stay. The hotel itself is pretty basic - the amenities are fine but nothing amazing. The breakfast is incredibly overpriced and I recommend going to any pub down the street for a full English breakfast. Internet and phone access are also very expensive but again, there are Internet cafes across the street and a pay phone in the lobby. The hotel is located about 5-10 minutes walk away from the Gloucester Road tube stop.Overall, I was quite comfortable in this hotel and would recommend it."
36,930,Oct 6 2008 	Not quite a Marriott	We stayed there for 3 nights. First time in this Marriott. Location is perfect. I think that that's one off the reasons that they are the most bussyest Marriott in London. Staff did there best but we think that the Marriott Canary Wharf is (far) better. We had to change room two times to get a room with a decent matras. Whenn one hass a verry bussy hotel one knows that you have to renew the matrasses more often. We found them all horrible. Not a Marriott worthy. Will probably not go back in the near future.
37,930,"Sep 25 2008 	Great Stay at the Marriott	My family of 4 stayed at the Marriott in mid-July. The location is just great. A few blocks from the tube, a large grocery store across the street and some local restaurants and nice pubs close by. This helped us save some serious money. You're on the edge of the city rather than in the heart, so it was quieter and more residential which was really nice. But in a few minutes on the tube you could be in the heart of the city.The daily breakfast was included in our rate and the food was simple but good. Because we had two kids with us, we decided to get a junior suite. The room was very large (sitting area, dining area and two king beds). The beds were comfortable and there was no problem with noise at night. We had access to the executive lounge but we didn't use it much. The pool is very small as is the hot tub. The staff were friendly and helpful.Overall we had a great time and would definitely stay there again."
38,930,"Sep 14 2008 	Excellent base for London weekend	We stayed at the Marriott London Hotel for a Friday &amp; Saturday night in September 2008 and would recommend it as an excellent base for a London weekend. We booked direct with the hotels website and one thing to look out for is that they released reduced prices (20% off) for the weekend on the Monday before. I do have one gripe about the booking process, the prices are quoted ex VAT which is only added later in the booking process so beware! Our room was on the 3rd floor and was standard chain hotel style with a double bed and small bathroom. The standard of decor was good however and more than suited our needs as a base for a weekend of sightseeing and theatregoing. Particularly good was the breakfast (included in the package which we bought) and it set us up to see the sights. The hotel also had a small pool and leisure club but as we didn't get around to using it I can't really comment. The hotel was very well placed being just a 5 minute walk from Gloucester Rd tube station which was a short ride to Leicester Square and Covent Garden and also within walking distance of Kensington Palace &amp; Gardens. At 120 a night (+ vat) it seemed to represent reasonable value for central London and we would definitely consider it again for future trips."
39,930,"Sep 11 2008 	THE BEST OF THE BEST	We had scheduled another hotel that turned out to be unacceptable. We walked into the Marriott and asked if they had a room for the week and they said yes. The Concierge desk took care of everything for us. They changed all my tour pickups to the hotel for us, were able to convert money, provided a PC to contact AAA who helped with the original trip to get re-embursed for the other hotel. I just can not say enough about how they went the extra mile to make our stay the best they could. There also was security so we felt very safe. Rooms were super clean, and very very nice. I would stay there everytime I come to London. Kudos to this hotel the stay couldn't have been better."
40,930,"Jul 31 2008 	Quiet corner of London	Stayed overnight before trip home. This is near the museums but away from the Central London. Lots of cafe, restaurants and supermarket within walking distance. Tube station is close by, but only if minimal luggage. Saw some tourist lugging their wheeled bags with dificulty. The pavements and road is not ideal for this. Faciliies are okay, room smallish especially with cot. Very clean and comfy though."
41,930,"Jul 11 2008 	Am I really in Europe?	My husband and I stayed at the Marriott from June 27th through 30th, 2008. This was the last leg of our vacation and Im so happy we booked this hotel. Compared to the other hotels we stayed in during our time in London and Paris this trip, this Marriott was by far the most superior. The room was just as large (if not larger) than the Marriott rooms in Toronto. It felt completely luxurious to us following the cramped quarters we had become accustomed to in European hotels.We booked our room on the Marriott website and got a fairly good deal - $120 pounds per night. The location was fantastic for us  there is a Sainsburys (grocery store) right across the street and the neighbourhood is much less busy and touristy than our first stop in London (Trafalgar Square). We were able to walk to Notting Hill and Covent Garden (over an hour walk, but we did it). The tube station Gloucester Road is just a few blocks away, which made traveling to the train station and airport a breeze.We were assigned room 141, which is not in the main tower, but along the side of the hotel, just up a small flight of stairs. Checking in and out was quick and easy. Our view was not great, but we were mainly there to sleep and relax, so it didnt bother us at all. We had a very comfortable king size bed, desk, chairs and coffee table, coffee maker, and all of the makings for complimentary coffee, tea, and hot chocolate (including the biscuits!). The bathroom was very large as was the tub and the toiletries were the best we had encountered on our trip (shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, bar soap, lotion). Everything was extremely clean and well-maintained. The Marriott London Kensington certainly made our last few nights in Europe stress free and enjoyable. We would absolutely recommend this hotel to friends and family and will definitely stay here again on our next trip to London  in fact, we will probably stay here for the entire trip."
42,930,Jul 9 2008 	Great bed pleasant hotel	Really enjoyed stay here. There's hassle free if expensive parking on site.Lovely room with great pillows and bed.Close to the V&amp;A museum and the shops on Kensington High Street and Brompton and Fulham Road.Don't bother with quite expensive breakfast...go to the cafe round the corner on Gloucester Road...great food...half the price.
43,930,"Jun 24 2008	Recommended	Just returned from a weekend at the hotel, which was very comfortable and clean. We were on the 8th floor, which had been a smoking floor but now only smells the very faintest bit of smoke, if at all. (and the windows open for fresh air, so smell was never a problem)As others have said, the room was small, but did not feel cramped. Bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels and toiletries. Staff was pleasant and held luggage post check out.Hotel is 5 minutes from the Gloucester Road tube, and the area is very safe. A couple of peeves: the hairdryer's location in a closet makes drying hair very awkward, and the hotel food and coffee are very pricy (coffee is 3 pounds, or $6!) Iti s also important to note that this hotel is outside the center of the downtown area - about a 15-20 minute tube ride from most attractions, though only 1 tube stop, or a 10 minute walk from the V&amp;A, Science Museum and Natural History Museum. As noted in other reviews, there are supermarkets across the street and between the hotel and tube, so very well located to pick up conveniences. We had breakfast at a little open air cafe right across from the tube that was reasonably priced and tasty. There is an airy bar right off the lobby, though it never seemed very lively. One more thing - the hotel was exceptionally quiet - I did not hear a sound all night and I am a light sleeper. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
44,930,"May 19 2008 	Would Definitely Return to the Kensington Marriott!	This is a wonderful property located midway between the Gloucester Road and Earl's Court Tube stations (right on the Piccadily line for easy access to/from Heathrow). There is a Sainsbury across the street and cute restaurants within walking distance. The hotel staff is very accommodating and the rooms are spacious and comfy. We love Kensington, and will definitely stay at this property again."
45,930,"Apr 24 2008 	Very nice stay	Good location, silent room, very tasty breakfast...reccomended!"
46,930,"Apr 8 2008 	Watch out for their bait and switch	First the good: Modern looking hotel with great restaurants, grocery, and shops nearby and a short walk to the tube. Now the bad: You may get stuck in a horrible basement annex room. The website only shows the nice hotel tower hotel an elevator ride away from hotel amenities. What they don't show you are basement annex rooms they may actually put you in. You have to walk through a tunnel for about a city block to get to your room and there are no amenities. These rooms shouldn't even be sold under the Marriott name. When you make your reservations, make sure you get a guarantee in writing that you get a tower room, otherwise you may end up in the basement for the same pice."
47,930,"Apr 7 2008 	Lovely Comfortable Hotel	I stayed at this hotel with my husband and in a room next door to my ultra-fussy sister. I have to say that we all had no complaints, apart from the heat in the room. It was air-conditioned, but this was rather noisy if left on. If switched off the room got very hot! Apart from this we ate, drank and slept in the hotel and were pleased with the comfort, cleanliness and service. Book online direct with the hotel and try and get a good deal. We paid 130 for the room for the night without breakfast so a little pricey, but in the range for the other nearby hotels and is probably one of the better ones. There are also loads of restaurants and bars nearby the hotel, and the location is good for transport (5 min walk from Gloucester Road underground) and only a 10-15 min walk for Earls Court and the Olympia for the shows."
48,930,Apr 7 2008 	Good bed and breakfast hotel	We stayed in family room which was small but very clean had lovely view of roof but then who looks out hotel windows? Hall ways were very narrow. Location was excellent although it would be a bit far from the underground if the weather had been wet. Breakfast was excellent but my fussy child would only eat the beans over all I would give it a good 3 stars almost 4 stars
49,930,"Apr 5 2008 	Stay for the location	I have stayed at the Marriott in Kensington on several occasions, often as a female travelling alone, and the main reason I stay here is for the location. As anyone who has been to London knows, the tube is full of stairs and getting cases to the street (let alone changing trains from Heathrow) is a nightmare and bad holiday start. Earls Court station on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow is a disabled station and hence has a lift to the street level. Its then 5 minutes walk through a residential area to the Marriott. So get off here from Heathrow, not at Gloucester Road station.The rooms here are small but comfortable. Although on my last stay I did think the bathrooms, while they are well equipped, could do with a spruce up.Sainsburys, laundry and internet (at cheap rates) are across the road. Great restaurants (at a good price), and other services are all within a 5 minutes walk which is more than safe at night.Having staying in the area several times including at the Radisson Edwardian Vanderbilt in Cromwell Road (around the corner) and others, the Marriott also wins because it is oh so quiet - hard to get in London.While the city centre may seem a tube ride away, the Kensington high street shops are less than 10 minutes walk away with Oxford St, Hyde Park and the like are about 30. The food is good and breakfast has a great selection including eggs made to order.Just a note if like me, you HATE the smell of smoke in a room, avoid the rooms on level 1. Many of these were previously smoking rooms and while the hotel has been smoke free for some time, they retain the smell.I booked on the Marriott web site getting 99 a night inc b/f ."
50,930,"Mar 26 2008 	A great choice!	My husband and I have just returned from London after a 2 night stay in the Marriott. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I was uncertain as to whether I should book here or not. However, we were extremely pleased with all aspects of our stay.On arrival, we were able to check in straight away, even though we had arrived a few hours before the designated 3pm check-in time. The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful. We were also encouraged with our choice when we saw the Arsenal 1st Team - if it's good enough for them , it's good enough for us!We were given a 2 day pass for the underground and bus which was great as we were not expecting that at all! The underground is only 5 minutes away - if even that - and is very accessible. The area is lovely, quiet and clean.The food was just beautiful - breakfast was included, and we had an evening meal as well. However, we found it to be a little pricey, about 75 for 2 main course and dessert and bailey coffees.Unfortunately, we didn't make time to try out the swimming pool and other leisure facilities. The newspaper was delivered every morning, we thought that was a lovely touch.Finally, the room was very comfortable, with iron, hairdryer etc to hand. It was exceptionally clean too.Overall, we loved our stay in the Marriott, Kensington, and will most likely book there again on our next trip to London."
51,930,"Mar 18 2008 	Marriott needs some help	Typical Marriott, but some obvious issues. 1.) I arrived separately from my husband and checked in. The &quot;in-training&quot; clerk was supposed to leave a message for him, but they checked him in separately into another room. Just a mess and the staff needs more training. Friendliness should be automatic. 2.) Power wash the front steps. Just grimey steps walking into the hotel from the sidewalk. Horrible first impression. Husband is a gold status and I've seen a lot of Marriotts (and related brands) and this one is just not on par with others we stayed at in the London area."
52,930,"Mar 5 2008	Good stay great neighbourhood	I stayed here with my teenaged daughter in early February after getting a satisfactory weekend rate over the hotel's own website. I'd stayed in the Holiday Inn Kensington last year and had been very impressed with the safe neighbourhood, the hotel being across the street from the Gloucester Road tube station and the great choices of shopping and eating. But that stay was only 1 night. I needed 3 nights this time, and the HI was too costly for that. So is the Marriott actually, during the weekdays!The Marriott was about a 5 minute walk from the said station, which makes it a bit of a struggle if you walk with a lot of heavy luggage. Check-in was OK, the room with a king bed given to us for the special rate was all right, although quite small - there was very little room to move in the room. Still, it was clean, quiet and cosy, with a comfy bed. They honoured my request for a rear room on an upper floor, which was appreciated. The breakfast (included in the rate) was OK. One issue: the reception tried to charge me for breakfast separately, even though I told them this was included in the rate, and luckily I had the computer printout confirmation to prove it. However, apparently they were not able to see this in my reservation, but much to their credit the management decided to not charge me extra for breakfast, thanks to my having written proof of this being included in my rate. Therefore, I advise potential customers to always carry full printouts of their reservations. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, mainly due to the safe, quiet and convenient neighbourhood (24-hour Sainsbury's across the street was quite appreciated!) and closeness to the tube - you can take the Piccadilly line directly from Heathrow to this station, which was a big consideration in my choice to stay here."
53,930,Feb 9 2008 	great location clean rooms but questionable management	The hotel's location is great for museums and some businesses particularly the Earl's court exhibition centre. The rooms are very clean and as is typical of Marriott has great beds but a very small with narrow corridors and low ceilings. No great views from the second floor but NO noise either from either busy Cromwell street or the interior. The hotel's &quot;spa&quot; entrance is of the lobby but it is a long hike through a warren of corridors to the Gym or what management passes off as one. There are two (old) treadmills that basically leave one staring a blank white wall with a TV perched at an awkward angle guaranteed to give one a crick in the neck if viewed when working out. In addition there are two cycles. If you are looking for a work out get there early as the limited machines get taken up quickly. Management proved to be inflexible despite a mistake on their part about holding my room for a 7 am arrival. They sold it and billed as a &quot;no-show&quot; even though reservations had been informed when booking about the need to hold the room for a late arrival. If you are on business and need a room on arrival and are willing to pay for an extra night to make a morning meeting make sure that you have it in writing from them .
54,930,"Jan 22 2008 	Nice hotel	The check in was handled efficiently. The room was nice and spacious. Actually, it has a pretty cool shower with 3 nozzles at various levels as well as a bathtub with shower.We had the conciege lounge access. It is not on a separate floor and although it is a pleasant room, more could be done in the way of snacks and food. I expect a Holiday Inn Express offers more for breakfast.The staff were friendly, the concierge was great, and I took a few walks around the hotel and area. It is a bit of a hike to the tube station, but there is a supermarket right across the street. Also, there's a laundromat across the street near the supermarket and away from the hotel a bit. If you want to wash your clothes, you have the chance to do it near this hotel. Yes, I know you can send it out with the hotel to do, but you can buy new clothes for what that costs and it is of little help when you are staying only one night.Anyways, it was a nice hotel and a pleasant experience - but we only stayed one night."
55,930,"Jan 5 2008 	Comfortable!	London was our last stay after Paris and Jerusalem. I knew we would be winding down and would need a comfortable place to stay. The reviews I read said this hotel was close to being like an American hotel. I love Europe and &quot;when in Rome...&quot;, but I wanted a comfortable place to end our vacation. This hotel was perfect. Roomy, an excellent location and the famous Marriott bed! The staff was so friendly and helpful; they helped with transportation to the airport as well as giving us excellent directions to tube stations, Starbucks, etc. We went downtown to view the fireworks on New Year's Eve and worried it might be a little crazy getting home afterwards. Not so. This hotel is a bit out of the way and not close to much ( except Harrod's!) but so accessible by the Underground. We will definitely stay here next time we are in London...."
56,930,"Jan 4 2008 	Decent value for London	I chose this hotel for a very brief London stopover on price and location. At about $300 (London!), it was almost $100 less per night than comparable hotels in town. The hotel itself appeared recently refurrbished, was extremely comfortable and service was excellent. I would have liked free Internet service but the provided breakfasts were ample. The hotel is on Cromwell Rd, a nondescript thoroughfare of no appeal. Biut it is very close to High Kensington and Earl's Court and an easy walk to the tube (Piccadilly line - which is also a straight shot to Heathrow)."
57,930,"Dec 31 2007 	Nice Stay at the Marriott	The room was very nice spacious and the service was pretty good at this hotel. The concierge suggested some very nice restaurants that were close by. The location was little farther than I expected from Harrods, but it was also windy that made it seem farther. The Sainsbury across the street was very nice to have though. The English breakfast is good and offers a lot if you have it in your rate, but I wouldn't pay 17.50, considering how bad the dollar is right now, for it. I only had a couple complaints. One was the hotel cleaning staff one day did not come to clean the room until five, when we just got back in and we had put the please service sign out that morning. The pull-out matress was very bad. It was very thin and lumpy and the sheets were not very warm and they don't provide a comforter for the pull-out, so I couldn't sleep very well. I would definitely suggest bringing your own warm blanket if you are going to be sleeping on the pull-out and are going in the colder months. The bathroom was bigger than I expected, it actually had a combination shower-bath and a shower on its own. There were some areas of what I thought was mold in the shower area and the ceiling was cracking quite a bit, but that is what happens in many bathrooms. The aromatherapy shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap were very nice. I think that I would stay here again."
58,930,"Dec 20 2007 	More than adequate great neighborhood	Admittedly, I chose this hotel based on a discount I got through a friend, and based on the location. But I found it to be very comfortable, very clean. I stayed at the Hilton Park Lane last year and thought this hotel was at least as nice. For the typical American traveler, they will probably find the rooms quite small, but you just have to realize that outside of the USA, bigger does not equate with better. Get used to it. The best part was the location of the hotel...minutes to two tube stops (Gloucester Square and Earl's Court), across the street from a Sainsbury's and a few blocks to a Waitrose, walking distance to the V &amp; A, Science Museum, Harrods, and Hyde Park. The worst part was the room service food...absolutely terrible, not to mention overpriced, so avoid it at all costs. I generally don't complain about food, no matter how bland or uninspired, but this was truly awful. And I was served malt vinegar for my chips in a BOWL!!?And watch out for lecherous single men while swimming in the pool alone. Gross."
59,930,"Dec 20 2007	Some good and some bad	We stayed here as part of a company Christmas party for one night on Saturday. The hotel is nicely designed in many ways, the foyer glass atrium is a wonder to behold. However the rooms are a slightly strange shape and size, comparitively small with very little room between the end of the double bed and the unit holding the television. Also the rooms were FREEZING when we arrived, hotels usually have some heating on already to make it a more pleasnt arrival.I turned on the heating and that sorted the temperature out after while but the bathroom remained extremely cold all the time. Many of my work colleagues mentioned this as being very strange indeed, even full blast heating and an open bathroom door didn't help much !The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable, in fact I nodded off for an hour before the evening event. The staff seemed very friendly and all in all you can certainly do much worse in this city. lee.wilson@gmail.com"
60,930,"Aug 28 2007 	Not a smoker...	Just returned from a weekend in London. I wouldn't get over-excited about this hotel. We got a good deal on lastminute.com but I believe when you book through a website at a lower rate then you end up with the inferior rooms. My husband and I are both non-smokers. I particularly hate smoke and no one smokes in my own house so obviously I booked a n/s room. However on arrival I was told that none was available. I was advised to check the room and if we weren't happy room service would come and open the window to freshen it up! What! How would that eliminate years of smoke. As soon as exiting the lift on the 7th floor the stench of smoke was overwhelming and the room even worse. I returned to reception and refused the room. Mysteriously a n/s room was then located, albeit with, I'm guessing, the worst view in the hotel the window only partially opened onto a flat roof and a smelly gutter ran beneath - punishment for being 'difficult' I imagine. Apart from all this the hotel was clean, concierge was excellent and location isn't bad. Didn't eat here at all so can't comment on the food."
61,930,"Aug 21 2007 	Very nice hotel	The hotel has a large and spacious reception area and we found all the staff - reception, concierge, at breakfast, and Luigi at the bar - to be friendly and efficient with any query we had. We had booked two inter-connecting rooms - one for my wife and myself and the other for our two teenager sons. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms themselves are small, but we found them to be comfortable and clean. We had no view at all from the rooms.Breakfast was very good and plentiful, and the staff there were again friendly and efficient. We used the internet on the hotel's computer - 3 for 15 minutes.I used the swimming pool and the steam room - they were almost empty. Again the leisure staff was very friendly.No tube station is very close to the hotel. We used both tube stations - Gloucester Road and Earl's Court. We agree with most other reviewers that Earl's Court is closer, but we tended to use Gloucester Road after it was dark. Paul's cafe opposite Gloucester Road tube station is very good for home-made bread and pastries. To sum up, we would certainly use the Marriott Kensington again. It is a modern and very efficient hotel. The only snag we hound was the walking distance to the tube stations. But you get used to this. After all you do a lot of walking in London!"
62,930,"Aug 16 2007 	Exactly what you would expect from a Marriott	My wife and I stayed here over a weekend in early July. A very pleasant stay - exactly what you would expect from a Marriott. Front desk staff were very efficient, courteous and friendly. Room was small by North American standards but we had more than enough room. The 2nd floor room was very clean, quiet and we had a very good sleep on the queen bed. Breakfast was included with our room rate - very good selection in the buffet. The concierge was friendly and helpful. Things we asked them to reserve for the next day were all there as requested.Convenient location with a huge 24hr Sainsbury grocery store across the street. Earls Court and Gloucester Road tube stations just minutes walk away.This is a business hotel so it can be very pricey hotel on weekdays, but can be very good value on weekends."
63,930,Aug 1 2007 	Very good hotel conveniently located	It was my first time at this hotel; usually I am staying at another property nearby. I was pleasantly surprised with high quality of the service. Reception area is spacious and staff was quick and professional. Room was on smaller side but very clean and bed was very comfortable. I was situated on the first floor so room didnt have nice view and you have to take few steps up without elevator. Breakfast was good as was choice of food. There is a swimming pool in the hotel (which I dint use it) and small gym adequately equipped. Area around hotel is nice with huge supermarket just across the street that works 24/7. Tube station is very close. I prefer Kensington area as on the one hand it is close to Heathrow airport (cca 30 min ride) and on the other it is centrally located so you can do sightseeing and shopping.All in all it was very good value for money.
64,930,"Jul 6 2007 	Extremely nice stay	Stayed June 30 to July 2, 2007Concierge was extremely helpful. Breakfast was included and was delicious. Restaurant staff attentive and brought us coffee and juice and toast before we even asked. Rooms were clean and beds were heavenly. We had a double executive room. It was large and well appointed. There was a grocery store directly acrossed the street that also carries wine/ beer and sundries.Easy access to Earls court eateries, and Gloucester Station.We highly recommend this hotel and thank the staff for a wonderful stay!"
65,930,"May 23 2007 	Pricey but good location	Stayed during May 6 to 12 with hubby and our 8 mth old baby. Booked using Marriott points and paid for 2 nts via Travelocity. Arrived early and received room as requested, non-smoking with a king bed, away from the elevators, and not facing the street. The Hotel's &quot;Virtual Concierge&quot; contacted me a few days before our arrival to allow us to make any special requests. We didn't receive our crib and the extra towels I had requested. Reminded the front desk at check-in about these items and housekeeping didn't bring them until we had to call them for more towels.The room was clean but smaller than North American standards; minus a few feet between the bed and the desk/dresser/tv. Bathroom was a reasonable size and clean.The front desk staff were friendly. The concierge/door men were not attentive, always looking busy even when we were standing right at the desk waiting to be helped. Sainsbury is across the street (open 24 hrs Mon to Sat) and Waitrose down the street was very convenient for us especially for picking up baby items. Internet cafe and laundry mat down the street. Restaurants near the Hotel, but are pricey or are chains like Ask, Garfunkels, KFC, and Burger King. Paul's patisserie/boulangier is across fron Gloucester Road stn, good for pastries and coffee but expect a wait.Walking distance to V&amp;A and Science museum (15 mins), Harrods and Kensington Palace/Gardens (30 mins - if you walk fast). Very close to Gloucester Road stn, Earls Court is a little further away. Underground is fast and can get you to all the sites quickly, furthest station we went to was Tower Hill (25 mins).I would recommend staying at this hotel, if using points or you get an amazing deal on the room rate and you don't mind taking the Tube to get to the sites. Don't bother eating at the Hotel (expensive) and upgrading to an Exec room (waste of money). Request a room away from the street and make sure you have your &quot;don't disturb&quot; sign out if you're a late sleeper as housekeeping comes around early."
66,930,"May 2 2007 	Nice Rooms But Don't Eat Here	Stayed here a couple of times during February 2007. The rooms are typical Marriott standard - good! However, don't bother eating here. The food is bland and expensive."
67,930,"Apr 30 2007	Fair value in an expensive city	The hotel has a great location...downtown and museums within easy reach via the tube. Earl's Court tube station is a couple of blocks if you shortcut through the hotel parking lot, and has numerous pubs and restaurants nearby. Do upgrade to the executive level; the included breakfast and use of the executive lounge alone make it worthwhile and the room size upgrade is a big plus for american travelers used to more spacious rooms."
68,930,"Apr 15 2007 	Ok	As I planned to visit the museums (especially the wonderful V&amp;A) in South Kensington, I booked the Marriott Kensington (and not the Renaissance Chancery Court where I usually stay when I'm in London). For this the location of the hotel is good, it's a 15 min. walk to the museums and five minutes to the next subway station. For activities more in the city center I wouldn't a chose hotel in this area.The standard rooms are quite small and in standard Marriott style; nothing special. The room I was given first had some noisy ventilation shaft right in front of the window; however I was given a more quiet room immediately. Still walls are quite thin and especially the doors very loud when they shut so it's not a very quiet place. Housekeeping was not good on a couple of details (used washcloth left in bathroom, not all garbage taken, ice bin not cleaned etc.). Nothing dramatic, but very unusual for a Marriott and not really good enough for the price you have to pay.On the positive side there is the very friendly, helpful and competent staff and the good breakfast. And the Sainsbury's supermarket opposite is very convenient."
69,930,"Apr 9 2007 	Never Slept Better!	We used points to return to the Marriott Kensington where we stayed three years ago due to its close proximity to where our daughter was living for a study abroad program. We loved our experience then, and we loved it now. I have never seen a cleaner bathroom in a hotel...ever. Nor have I slept in a more comfortable bed. While the first room we were put in was small, it was comfortable(same bed, same immaculate bathroom). When it became available, we were able to move to an Executive King room which was huge by any city hotel standards. We loved our breakfast every morning in the Executive Lounge and loved the small but adequate gym. We never had time to take advantage of the hot tub, pool and steam room, but would have liked to. Another appreciated feature of this property is its wonderful and professional staff. Ron and Lee at the concierge desk went above and beyond to take good care of us. We were extremely comfortable with all aspects of this property including its close proximity to everything we wanted to do. This served as a wonderful base for us for a wonderful week in England. We will be back!"
70,930,"Apr 9 2007 	A bit out of town but good value	We stayed for two nights over Easter. We had a double room on the ground floor. The reception was smart and modern and we received excellent service throughout our stay. The breakfast, included in the price, was superb, one of the best we've had in a hotel. Overall, this was a great hotel and we would certainly stay here again. It was a bit far from the more central attractions in London, but the bus ride (no.74) meant that we were, at best, half an our away from Oxford Street."
71,930,"Apr 7 2007 	Great hotel in a great location	Marriott Kensington turned out to be a great choice...close to everything. The staff was helpful, though not the most knowledgeable we've ever seen. But walking through the parking lot gets you to Earl's Court tube station in a block; much is in walking distance and the rest just a few tube stops away.Upgrade to the executive level; the breakfast and executive lounge are well worth the extra money."
72,930,"Mar 21 2007 	Ideal Position	Had an excellent deal on hotel room and upgraded to exec suit which was well worth it as had large sitting area. Lovely clean hotel, didn't use pool etc so can't comment on that. We were going to Earls Court which was just a short walk away (tube station near also!). Ideal location for all we needed to do which included a night in China Town, just a short taxi ride away. Breakfast staff a little slow but on the whole good. Had use of executive lounge with free snacks etc. Would most definately stay in this hotel again, it must be good as the whole Spurs Team were staying also!"
73,930,"Mar 17 2007 	Not that good	I am sorry, but this hotel is not what you would expect from a Marriott. The rooms, are small and completely ordinary. I stayed at the much cheaper Comfort Inn a little further down the street, two months ago, and it just as nice as this and breakfast included. It was also closer to the tube.This felt more like a weak 3 star hotel than a 4 star."
74,930,Mar 8 2007 	Good value for a weekend in London	We booked this hotel using the Top Secret lists on Lastminute.com and were quite pleased to find it was the Marriott. This doesn't quite reach the high standards of Marriotts in other city centres in the UK - the room was a little smaller and the fitness centre facilities not as good. The pool and surrounding areas were not spotlessly clean and the steam room not working but there was painting work going on. The public spaces in the hotel are quite limited although well furnished. It was an accepable place to stay but would not recommend it for a special occasion.
75,930,"Mar 2 2007	Lovely airy hotel	The hotel is a lovely airy and big place, with a large atrium great to relax with a cup of coffee and a book in. The Natural History museum was just a short walk away. The rooms are spacious and the bedding fabulous, lovely sheets and pillows. The staff were welcoming and friendly and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to my friends and family, in fact I already have!!! Thank you for a lovely stay."
76,930,"Feb 4 2007 	Good Business Hotel	I stayed for business and found the room large and the bathroom clean. Breakfast is outrageously expensive. It would be much better to head to Paul's across from the Gloucster tube stop, which is a few blocks away. It was hard to regulate the heat in the room. I would wake up hot in the middle of the night, turn off the heat, then be cold in the AM. The wireless connection is very good. The grocery store is a nice benefit and the location is good."
77,930,Jan 27 2007	Gloomy 	Although this is a GREAT property I wouldn't necessarily recommend staying in the Wintertime because of the gloomy weather and somewhat isolated locale.....the BEST thing is the grocery store right across the street. Maid staff was superb and room service was all right. Did honor our request for early check-in but we did have to wait about 2 hours before a room was ready.
78,930,"Jan 23 2007 	Good location big hotel	A big modern, purpose-built hotel, unusual for central London. Staff are efficient, concierge service is excellent, breakfast is great. Rooms are a bit on the small side (but not as bad as many London hotel rooms) and spotlessly clean. The location is good - there's a Sainsbury's across the road and the Gloucester Road tube station is an easy five to ten minute walk away. Pretty much what you'd expect from a Marriott."
79,930,"Jan 6 2007 	Great Hotel	Just returned from 4 day stay at the Marriott Kensington. Hotel is in a great location for sightseeing with a tube station just along the road, and taxis usually sit outside. Rooms are a bit smaller than usual Marriott rooms, but usual for London. Rooms are spotless and well kept with everything you need, after all you don't go to London to stay in your room! Can't understand why anyone would have an overheated room, as all rooms have seperate air conditioning. Shower is superb, very powerful. Breakfasts are excellent and eggs are made to order, chef will even make you an omelette if you like. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Will stay there again."
80,930,"Dec 26 2006 	Good Location small hot rooms	This hotel with a good location for seeing the city, lacks the normal Marriott feel. Rooms are small, over heated, but have great bathroom facalities.We called several times about the heat and while they reacted quickly to our complaints they were not able to stop the heat from roasting us. Breakfast included was very nice off the lobby. Great shopping right across the street at Sainsburys with all sorts of English goods available. Right between two tube stops and good bus service."
81,930,"Dec 3 2006 	Out of this world	We had a terrific time from the start:1. Pay 50 more and go for the executive room.At 229 per night you get one hell of a large room.Amazing soft beds with amazing pillows.A huge bathroom with 2 showers that we tested simultaneously and they worked perfectly. The main shower has three spouts that really give you a massage as well.Two hand basins and enough towels for Africa.2. Terrific view up Cromwell road from room.3. Exec lounge that provides free non alcoholic drinks all day and up to midnight. Loads of different papers.Honour bar from 5.30pm its up to you to admit what you took!Free healthy breakfast that abounds with great salmon etc and stacks of fresh fruit prepared etc, etc, wonderful other stuff - no fried stuff that is unhealthy. An excellent coffee machine that has about 6 choices of hot drinks.A full selection of teas.In the evening the snacks are very generous - not enough to call it dinner, but enough to satisfy pre theatre hunger.4.The Staff bend over backwards so much that they almost flip.Katie at reception is one of the best we came across in many years. She is a world class winner.The team of concierges are amazing, they do anything for you.We have stayed at many Marriotts in the USA - but this one beats the whole lot. This is what I call world class luxury and service!PLEASE DON'T DROP YOUR STANDARDS!If you have read this far - do not use Gloucester Rd exclusively.If you walk down the car ramp that continues through the building you will come into a street that leads straight into Earl's Court Tube which is 3 min away - about 1/2 the distance to the other tube. On the way there are a few amazing little eateries."
82,930,"Nov 29 2006	Worth every cent!	This hotel was a bit pricey, but definitely worth it. Here's why: 1. Very clean room with a (truly) spotless bathroom2. Great supermarket located just across the street (opens late)3. Located in a very nice, safe, and relatively central area of the city4. Located less than a 5-minute walk from Gloucester Road tube station (you couldn't find better proximity)"
83,930,"Nov 8 2006 	Very pleasant	Booked the hotel for one night whilst we saw a show at the nearby Hammersmith Apollo. This was the second time we'd used this hotel for this purpose, the first time having spent 10mins in another hotel and checking straight out again.We booked on lastminute and paid 140 for the Saturday night, right at the extreme of my budget for one night. However the hotel is in my opinion worth it. The rooms are a decent size, nicely furnished with a decent bathroom. The view we had was not that pleasant, over a small alleyway, but I wasn't booking for a view. The King Size bed was wonderful, comfortable, more pillows (feather, well done Marriott) than you could shake a stick at, and best of all, a duvet - other hotel chains take note, who on Earth uses blankets these days?The bar area was comfortable, but FANTASTICALLY expensive, with a poor selection. We only had the one drink. The room rate we paid didn't include breakfast, but no matter, there's a decent place right opposite the nearby Gloucester Rd tube station that does a lovely breakfast for a reasonable (London) price, and nextdoor to that a fantastic French style Boulangerie. This, combined with the proximity of the excellent Natural History, Science and Victoria and Albert Museums (all now free) makes this hotel an ideal spot for those wanting to see London, but not wanting all the frenetic hassle of the West End, as transport links to Kensington and Chelsea are excellent.Highly reccomended."
84,930,"Nov 2 2006 	Good Hotel	This was a nice hotel with a good location. The room was small but very clean. They originally had us in a ground floor room which was not acceptable. You had to walk past a bunch of conference rooms down a dingy hall to a smelly room. After a bit of a wait they were very obliging in giving us a room on a higher floor. The staff in the breakfast room in the morning were very pleasant and friendly and the breakfast was excellent. Although there are hotels closer to tube stops, I would stay here again."
85,930,"Oct 29 2006 	Close to the Dinosaurs!	I just returned from an overnight stay at the Marriott Kensington with my 31/2 year old son. My expectation weren't overly high. We only needed a place to rest our heads for the night as our primary reason for being in London was to visit the Science and Natural History museums. We arrived at the hotel at about 1:30 pm and I had reserved the Shop til You Drop promotion. This included breakfast and a 30 gift voucher for Harrods. There was a problem with when we checked-in. Our pre-requested room of two beds or a double and a sofa bed had been assigned, but when we tried to check-in the rep said our room had been assigned to another guest. This also seemed to be the same problem for the two guests checking in right before me. Apparently, pre-assigned rooms were being reassigned on a first come, first serve basis - even though check-in was not until 2:00 pm. I was asked to wait while the problem was sorted out and 20 minutes later they were still trying to fix. I told them not to worry as my son still climbs in the bed with me at home now anyway. For my understanding we were sent a couple of bottles of water and three pieces of fruit. Nothing much, but the gesture was worth noting.Our room was very small (336). The smallest of any room I have stayed in Europe. The view from our window was directly into an alley, but it was quiet so I didnt care. The bed was very comfortable. If you are on an extended stay everything you need is nearby. There is a Sainsbury right across the street and a short walk away is Starbucks, a wonderful patisserie called Paul, etc. The breakfast options were varied, unfortunately the cooked food seemed to be sitting out all day and was not very palatable. I ate a couple of pieces of toast and had a better coffee at Starbucks.The location served us. We were able to walk to all the museums and to Harrods. We actually walked from Victoria Station which took us about 45 minutes. Hyde Park is about a 15 -20 minute walk and Buckingham Palace was about 40 minutes. The fiasco at check-in did not bother me. I did have a bit of a problem with some mildew in the bathroom. See pictures. Though, I would probably not stay here again I can still recommend the Marriott Kensington. I usually stay at the Sofitel St. James, but it was not convenient for this visit to London."
86,930,"Oct 28 2006 	Great hotel	My fiance and I stayed two nights at the Marriott Kensington on points and we really enjoyed it. We chose this hotel after consulting reviews here on TripAdvisor, and I have to say that this site was very helpful.It's a clean, modern hotel in a nice neighborhood. It's not a very busy neighborhood, but there are shops and restaurants within walking distance. As others have pointed out, it's about equal walking distance to the Gloucster Rd and Earl's Court tube stops, about 5-10 minutes. After trying both, we decided we liked the walk to the Earl's Court stop better as you go down a quaint neighborhood street with a couple of pubs and sidewalk restaurants. From the Earl's Court station, you can get pretty much anywhere in London in a reasonable amount of time.The room was on the small side, but this wasn't a big issue as we spent most of our time seeing the sites in the city. The bathroom was not spectacular, but it was decent. A pretty standard Marriott setup. A note of caution, this was my first experience with an automated mini-bar. Before you start moving stuff around in the mini-fridge to store drinks you buy at the market across the street, notify someone. We had to get someone from the front desk to verify that we hadn't removed anything from the mini-bar. If not, we would have been charged 50 pounds for items we didn't use.The concierge lounge is one of the nicest that I have seen at any Marriott, and it was open every day from morning til night if I'm not mistaken. We took advantage of their breakfast offerings every morning. It wasn't a huge breakfast. It was continental style with muffins, pastries, and cereal, and it also had eggs and bacon. My fiance enjoyed their coffee, and I was big fan of the tea offerings.Overall, it's a great hotel to stay at. It's not a five star property, but it's a comfortable, clean hotel in a decent location. I would definitely stay here again."
87,930,"Oct 18 2006 	Loved the location	Arrived from the airport around 9:00 am, concierge immediately took our luggage to store. Front desk told us there were no rooms ready yet but she would have one ready for us by noon. We expected this anyway and thought noon was better than the normal check in time of 2:00 so we were happy. we had a street map with us from Fodor's and I had studied it for weeks so we felt very comfortable with area immediately. also, had lots of info from talfers, thanks! We are in our 40's and have traveled extensively but never to Europe. We stayed at the Marriott with our points so it was totally free but those points took a long time to earn and i did a lot of research before picking this hotel. Great choice! Very nice rooms, queen bed (even though their website would only guarantee us a double bed), very clean, very quiet lobby while we were there, restaurant and bar were never busy. we did not use any hotel services in the two days because we were either being tourist or sleeping. Used Sainsbury mkt across the street both days...lots of grab and go foods available there and an ATM in the store. We were much happier with this location than the fancier HIlton on Park Lane that we moved to for the rest of the week.Gloucester Rd and Earls Court tube stop were both very convenient, we tried both and found a nice pub (earls court tavern) and a good Indian restaurant (Marsala Zone) near the Earls court tube stop which is a busy neighborhood area.We would stay here again and it was an easy tube ride from Heathrow with no problems taking luggage."
88,930,"Oct 14 2006	OK	Just back from a 12 night stay for business. Overall, it was fine - not amazing - but fine. The room was rather small - not sure what I expected but it wasn't huge. Smaller than Marriott rooms in the US. Closet had a strange, bad, smell. Bathroom was updated, but small too. Over the course of the twelve nights, service was generally OK but some minor problems that were kind of annoying - turndown service missed a few times, housekeeping not doing a full job every time, etc. The location is fine - about a 1/2 hr Tube ride to the City plus a 10 min. walk to the Tube stop. There are laundry and grocery stores nearby. The breakfast options are very good - full meal or just a coffee bar. As I was checking out, they tried to charge me 1.5 GBP ($3) per day for the mini USA Today. I thought this was unreasonable - they never mentioned a charge when they asked if I wanted one. They ended up taking it off the bill (which was quite large for 12 nights!) but only after an argument. Also, when I checked in, they had my reservation wrong - only had me down for 1 night - despite being completely accurate on Marriott's website. Overall, I thought it was OK. Don't think I'd stay here again though. Would rather try some place else next time."
89,930,Oct 10 2006 	Great Stay Excellent location	Just got back from 2 day stay in this hotel . Everything was excellent. Only slight gripe was that at breakfast on Sunday there was a queue a mile long and we were put in &quot;internet corner&quot; not in the restaurant and then got slightly overlooked. But everything else was fine -lovely leisure club. Would def stay here again.
90,930,"Sep 19 2006 	Excellent hotel	Excellent value. We booked a one night stay. Expedia got us a Sunday night stayover deal that included a Harrod's gift certificate worht 50 pounds and a free breakfast at the hotel. We used the gift at Harrod's without difficulty Sunday afternoon. (The pizza restaurant at Harrod's was slow to debit the card because the accounting who needed to verify it only had one person working on Sunday afternoon. The manager was quite apologetic about the delay.) Checkin at the hotel was very easy. The staff was very friendly and very helpful, obviously wanting to help with whatever we wanted. The conceirge was pretty busy as well, but very nice and effecient was our luggage. The room was good sized specially by London standards. We had queen sized bed in a room that was large enough to easily walk around in even with luggage and backpacks. The furniture was in excellent condition, looked fairly new and contemporary, and the bed was very comfortable. The only downside is that there was no wastebasket in the bathroom. The hotel staff did seem a bit short handed, perhaps because it was early Sunday afternoon when we checked in. There was only employee at the reception desk when we got there and, as I mentioned, the conceirge was alst quite busy with guests. All in all, the hotel is an excellent value and only about a 5 minute walk up Gloucester Road from the Gloucester tube stop."
91,930,"Aug 29 2006 	Met expectations	The hotel was as expected, per the reviews I read. The room was upgraded for me because I arrived early (about 10:30AM), and it was the only one ready. The staff was very accomodating. The location was a pleasant 6-7 minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube stop (District, Circle, Picadilly lines).Nice health club and pool. Full breakfast was included, and I got a 100 pound voucher for a future Marriott European stay. The room was pricey, about $250 per night."
92,930,"Aug 24 2006 	Unpleasant is an understatement for this hotel	Reading previous reviewers' comments, we were excited to check in to the London Kensington Marriott in July for three days. As Marriott Reward members, we had stayed in Marriott hotels in the US and Europe many times and were acquainted with the normally excellent value and locations. But we were shocked to find the London Kensington to be the exception. Let me preface my remarks by stating that we reserved the room (a king, nonsmoking) months ahead , had confirmed the reservation a number of times, and were told we would receive a full English Breakfast each morning with our rate.  . When we got to the hotel (after reconfirming our room that morning), we were told that our room was not available because the person who had the room the night before had requested to extend his/her stay and our room was no longer available. The reservationist offered us a queen bed in smoking. We refused. She then told us she could put us in another Marriott in London if there was availability. We again refused, but requested to speak to a manager. To make a long story short, we were finally given a king size bed in nonsmoking (which suddenly became available) with NO Air conditioning (in the middle of one of London's heat waves). We were moved the next day to a room with windows and a king bed with air conditioning, but the odor of soiled diapers permeated the room to such a degree that it became nauseous to stay in for any length of time. (This despite, the comfortable bed, linens, and lovely bathroom.) To make matters worse, we were told we were not to have the &quot;full English breakfast&quot; , but would have to eat in the &quot;executive lounge&quot;, where the breakfast consisted of cold eggs, stale pastries, deli meat, and below par cheese,We had looked forward to a previous reviewer's photo perfect breakfast, but found the price to be exorbitant, to say the least!We were only too glad to check out when we did and travel on to our next Marriott in Inverness, Scotland, which was a delight in all respects. This is our first review of a hotel and we realize it reads the opposite of all the others. But beware, because I honestly believe that this unpleasantness can happen again to someone else. Mina from Virginia, US"
93,930,"Jul 10 2006 	Excellent Location Good Value	I stayed at the Marriott Hotel Kensington for 2 Nights in July 2006. This was a business trip, and the hotel is well suited for meetings both in &quot;downtown&quot; areas of London or out the M4. With the quick Tube access it is easy to get to Waterloo or Paddington Train Stations.The rooms were very clean, with the upgraded beds.The staff was friendly, although they seemed to at a loss when asked for dining options outiside the hotel. The pool and gym are both very nice, althought. As with most things in London, expect things to be a little smaller than in the US."
94,930,"Jun 6 2006	Wonderful stay at the Marriott Kensington	Our family of four (including mom, dad, and two teenage daughters) stayed for four nights at the Marriott Kensington. Spacious room, large bathroom, and most importantly, very clean. The staff was helpful, the executive lounge was a huge help for a quick breakfast and a light evening snack. It is about a five minute walk to the metro station, but the streets are safe and well-lit. I highly recommend this for a family travelling in London!!!"
95,930,"May 21 2006	Excellent Hotel	We stayed here for one night and our room was spacious, with a really comfortable bed.The bathroom was large with a bath and shower and a good selection of toiletries.The health club was fantastic, the member of staff on duty was really helpful and let us walk round the facilities before we decided to use them. There is a swimming pool, spa bath, sauna and steam room. We didnt bother going out in the evening and just relaxed in there.Check in/out was no hassle and the concierge looked after our bags whilst we did some more exploring/shopping before going home.Would stay here again if we got a good deal again!"
96,930,"May 18 2006	Excellent London Base	My husband and I stayed here on the first night of our 30th anniversary 2 week tour of Great Britain. Having visited London 5 years earlier, we were aware that the size and quality of hotel rooms in London was variable, so we really didn't know what to expect. We were very favorably impressed with this property compared to our experience 5 years earlier. We arrived late morning on a Saturday after our overnight flight; our room was not yet ready, but the concierge cheerfully held our bags while we went out for lunch. When we got back and saw our room, I was wishing we could stay a little longer.The room was spacious by London standards. One of the strongest points in its favor is that, having opened April 2003, everything is still in perfect condition, not rundown from use as some London hotel rooms can be. The bed was up to the Marriot standards of sink-down comfort and quality, and the bath tub and shower were one of the best I've seen, having an oversized tub for someone to take a real bath in and a handheld shower attachment for rinsing with (again, in brand new condition.) I would recommend signing up for the full English breakfast, as they had one of the better breakfasts of our stay (see photos.) It had a continental breakfast section with quite a variety of meats, cheeses and fruits, and the hot buffet had an excellent variety of meats, eggs and accompaniments. A large Sainsbury grocery store is right across the street, which is VERY helpful when needed. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Gloucester Road tube stop; the key thing about this is that it is a major tube stop from which you can access the Circle, District and Picadilly lines, which will get you just about anywhere with a minimum of line switches. The Picadilly line goes straight to Heathrow and the theater district, so you could actually fly in at Heathrow, hop straight on the Picadilly line, and have a short walk with your luggage straight to the hotel. We actually did this in reverse, for the next morning we got a car at Heathrow to head out of town. Very convenient. I would definitely use this hotel for a London base again in the future. Check their website for deals on 2 or more nights. The website compared favorably with others, and the cancellation policy is good in case you need to change your plans (which we did with no problem.) Knowing how dicey it can be to get a decent quality room in London without paying through the nose and tripping over each other constantly once you get there, I can definitely recommend this property as a sure bet for staying in London."
97,930,"May 14 2006	Great hotel great location	Great stay at an excellent location. We were looking for a reasonably inexpensive hotel in a location that would allow easy access to both the airport and the city center. It's within walking distance of two underground tube stops and the surrounding area is nice too. The room was standard Marriott - clean, comfortable, and with all the necessary amenities. The staff was delightfully courteous. There's nothing more I would have asked for!"
98,930,"May 5 2006	Great Hotel in a FANTASTIC Location	The Marriott Kensington is a very nice hotel and the rooms are HUGE by European standards! The bathrooms are impeccably clean, modern, and large. The complimentary supplied bath products were also top quality. Best of all, you could open your window at night and hear NOTHING! Believe me, this is an awesome feature for any hotel in London.The lobby and common areas were nicely furnished and the flower arrangements were spectacular. The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant was very good and the staff was very attentive. Kensington is our favorite part of London - many cafes and fantastic parks. We absolutely love the area and thoroughly enjoyed walking the beautiful neighborhoods. The architecture and the gardens in this part of town are unbeatable. Bring comfortable walking shoes, because if you don't explore the neighborhoods - you are missing some hidden gems that make London such a wonderful city.The Marriott is an easy 3 block walk from the Gloucester Road Tube Stop. Earl's Court is 5 minutes in the other direction. We walked at all hours of the day and felt VERY safe. We also enjoyed the wonderful array of restuarants - all within a five minute walk of the Marriott. You can reach any part of London from this part of Kensington - Gloucester Road is served by three Tube lines and all the majore sites are within a 15 minute ride.We would heartily recommend the Marriott Kensington. The staff at the hotel helped make our 3rd visit to London the best, yet! We will definitely stay at the Marriott Kensington on our next trip to this beautiful city."
99,930,"May 2 2006 	Great hotel wonderful location	Just returned from a 3-night stay with my parents and were very impressed - good even by Marriott standards. Rooms were the usual smaller 'London-size', but were well maintained and spotlessly clean. All the staff we came into contact with were courteous and professional.The location is very good in its own right, but also reprersents great value versus hotels absolutely right in the centre. Gloucester Road tube was closest at 3 mins walk followed by Earls Court at 5 mins - and these allow you to get to wherever you want to go in minutes. Instead of always jumping on the tube however we took time to explore the delightful neighbourhoods of Kensington and Chelsea on foot from the hotel.These picture-perfect streets of townhouses with beautifully manicured gardens were lovely to see, and there were hidden delights to look for around many corners - cobbled mews through stone archways, back alleys with 'hidden' cafes or pubs, and of course the main thoroughfares of High St Kensignton, Brompton and Kings Roads with their unique boutique shops and trendy cafes - great for people-watching.Cannot recommend this place enough. I used to live in London so know the city well - and I'll definately come here again next time."
100,930,"Apr 9 2006	Consistently Marriott	Our stay at this hotel was expectedly pleasant. The staff was coridal and pleasant with each encounter, and helped us resolve a mini-bar issue (do not rearrange items in the mini-bar as you will be billed automatically for anything that is moved!) Interior noise was nominal. The bed was not the standard Jamison Bed found in North American Marriott Hotels, but it was quite comfortable nonetheless. The leisure club was clean and contained well maintained equipment. To sum it up, this is a full-service hotel with a slightly less than full-service price that will satisfy all but the most cantankerous travellers."
101,930,"Mar 20 2006	Excellent Hotel	Stayed at the Marriott Kensington from March 15 to the 19th 2006. I was influenced by both the Trip Advisor reviews, location, plus had lost out on other nearby hotels (didn't reserve in time). After getting over the sticker shock (in London generally though), this was an excellent place to stay. We were 2 adults and 2 children staying in an executive room with 2 double beds and a sofa bed. Room was outstanding in terms of appearence and cleanliness, so was the bathroon (2 showers...very convenient). Staff was extremely helpful and accomodating from the check-in, to the concierge who recommended some restaurants on our first night, to the executive lounge room, where we had breakfast (included, and quite good). Location is very good, 5 minutes from the Gloucester Street Tube station, and about 10 minutes to the Natural History/Science/Victora and Albert Museums. Supermarket across the street. My only criticism is that for an executive suite prices the least they could have provided was free WiFi and local calls, or at least in the executive lounge. Would likely stay there again"
102,930,"Mar 6 2006 	Great value and service	Stayed at the Marriott on Feb 25 and 26. I have been to London many times and always have a hard time to find a good 3-3.5 star hotel at a good price. Well I found it. I had a price of 74GBP on Expedia and found the location to be perfect for my business purposes. Easy access by the undergound although with the work currently happening on the Picadilly line I had to take the Heathrow Express (at the underground price) to Paddington and transfer to Earls Court. I do not need to add anything else about the hotel that has not been said in other good reviews. The room by London standards is a good size and clean. I will mention that some reviews comment on the staff not speaking good English. If you take the time to speak with them, which I did, you will find out that the majority work there from other countries in order to learn or improve their English skills, which I find great. Let's give them a chance. Overall I had a great service and a good restaurant recommendations. This is my new home in London when I return"
103,930,"Jan 6 2006	Great Stay in Kensington	We stayed in this hotel for a few days before Christmas and were very pleased with the location, and room amenities. Within walking distance of all the free museums, and the Tube. Very clean room, and impressed that the bathroom wasn't typical of most 'European' ones. There were plenty of toiletries and towels! We would stay here again! Only complaint is that English is not the first language of most of the employees. Front desk, etc. personnel had trouble understanding us."
104,930,"Nov 21 2005	Highly recommend!	First, it's a Marriott. So you know (to at least a certain degree) what you are going to get. As stated in other reviews, the beds are great. It actually was the highlight for us since we only could stay for one night (in London). The huge market across the street is a great way to lessen the blow of the GBP vs. USD exchange rate. We bought snacks, water, etc. and saved quite a bit compared to hotel charges. We booked it for a weekend on Marriott's own website and rec'd a weekend special for 125GBP which included a free buffett breakfast that was very good. Actually, the eating area offers a decent street view of the traffic and local buildings via huge windows. Check-in was smooth as well as Check-out. The only drawback was getting to it from Heathrow. A one-way cab ride runs about 40-45 quid (i.e. $80-$90 USD) tip not included. You can take a train, but keep in mind of the stairs/escalators. We had quite a bit of luggage and simply found it too cumbersome to give the train a whirl. If you take the LHR Express to Paddington, we were told it would be an additional 10 quid to take a cab to the hotel. So, if there are two or more of you travelling at 14 quid for the train plus the taxi, you can do the math. You are fairly close a cab offering door to door service. Obviously, this drawback is not particular just to this hotel, but any in the area. It is about 4-5 stop from Picadilly and that suited us just fine as the crowds can be bit exhausting. Overall, I would happily stay there again (and probably will)."
105,930,"Oct 5 2005	Simply excellent!!	Although this hotel may be a bit far out from some of the main London attractions, it is definitely worth a stay. There are two metro stations within easy walking distance (one on the district line, the other the circle line) that make a trip to any of the sites very easy. If you purchase a day travel metropass after 9:30 am, it is only 4.70 pounds and allows you to ride all day within zone 0 and 1 (which is where all the sites are). Well worth it. The hotel staff was top notch. Very friendly and very helpful. The room was great and clean. And since this used to be a different hotel and Marriott purchased it, everything seems to be newer. Especially the beds which are crazy comfortable. They are the new Marriott beds that are more comfy that the one you have at home. Also, since I am a Marriott elite member from many stays on business, we were granted access to the executive lounge. Unlike a lot of Marriotts in the states where the lounge is only open certain hours, this one was open from 6am to midnight. Very convenient when you get in late after a long day of sight-seeing and just want to grab a soda. However, unlike some Marriotts in the states, the alcohol during happy hour will cost you."
106,930,"Sep 13 2005	Wonderful Week	As is typical of Marriott hotels, everything was spotlessly clean and the furniture and decor looked quite new. There's a super market across the street and the tube is only 5 blocks away. There were plenty of food places around, plus ATMs and exchange facilities.I loved the fact that our flight arrived much too early and seeing as our room was not yet ready, we were invited to shower and change in the gym facilities. They kept our luggage as well and could therefore enjoy our first day thoroughly. Service at the breakfast buffet was wonderful and I must say their breakfast was the best meal I had during my whole London stay. Food everywhere is bland and expensive, but their English Breakfast was absolutely scrumptious. My husband still asks me to make him pseudo-English breakfasts on Sundays!"
107,930,"Aug 12 2005	Good value	At GBP109/Night with breakfast and premium pounds offer, it was of good value in London.Like everebody else, liked having a Sainsbury right in front, a laundry shop that offered serviced wash for GBP5 only (may vary depending on the volume of your laundry), short walks to Glocester road station, easy access to Heathrow by car.Room facing the atrium doesn't have any window, and my particular room had some constant humming noise probably from the air ducts. I've asked for a switch immediately, and the new room facing a small street with opening window was much much better.Sauna and steam rooms are complementary to guests and was okay but swimming pool was too small for any real exercise."
108,930,"Aug 6 2005	Nice hotel good value for London	We enjoyed our stay at this typical Marriott hotel. We booked using our AAA discount and got a very reasonable rate (109 pounds + VAT). Friendly housekeeping staff did a great job cleaning our room. Courteous reception staff on check-in. Good security made us feel safe (expect to hand over your luggage to have it searched when you walk in the front door). Our room was spotless with good lighting and attractive furnishings showing very little wear and tear. Our room had a window that could be opened, and fine air conditioning/fan controls. Our bathroom was modern, well lit, with good water pressure. Nice large tv with cable. Our room was probably a standard size for Europe, but quite a bit smaller than we are accustomed to in the US. The minibar is very expensive - but a fully stocked Sainsbury's grocery store is across the street (there's a Starbucks inside it). Skip the hotel breakfast at 16.95 pounds sterling, per person. Gloucester Road which has several small cafes with delicious coffee and pastries for a more reasonable price, is a short walk up Cromwell and you'll have to go there anyhow to catch the Tube. We walked to Westminster Pier from this hotel but it takes about an hour on foot, so bring good walking shoes or plan on taking the Tube or Taxi."
109,930,"Jun 25 2005	very pleased with Marriott	My husband and I just returned from our stay at the Marriott in Kensington, London. Overall , we were very pleased with the hotel. We booked tours two of the days we were there and were picked up dropped off within five minutes walking distance of our hotel by the tour agencies. The tube station is also within five minutes walking distance as well as many restaurants. We were not that impressed with the meal selections or prices offered at the hotel so we ventured out and found a nice variety of restaurants in the immediate area. There is an Italian restaurant on the corner across from the tube station that is so good. If you go, please try the lobster and shrimp spaghetti. There is a grocery store right across the street so save money and don't use any of the items in the mini bar. The hotel was very clean and the room was a nice size. The only problem we had was when the refrigerator stopped working one night. Room service then gave us a free large bottle of cold water to get us through the evening and the refrigerator was fixed the next day. Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any question about anything as we tried our best to do everything and we managed to do a lot."
110,930,"May 16 2005 	Brilliant!!!	I stayed at this hotel in February 2005. This hotel is one of the best in London. The only downfall is its location. Unless you want to go to Earls Court there is little else to do around the area. The nearest tube is either Gloucester Road or Earls Court. The hotel is great - loved the duvet on the beds! Brilliant breakfast, great bar and lovely swimming pool. Couldnt faulf the hotel. Reception staff were brilliant and really helpful!A credit to marriott hotels."
111,930,"Apr 4 2005	Great Hotel	Stayed at this hotel for two nights over easter weekend.Rooms were really lovely. In our original room you could hear the generator so we spoke to reception who moved us to a junior suite with two king size beds. Whilst our original room was great, this room was something else! We were also entitled to access to the executive lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks all day. Pool was clean and generally quiet. We have stayed at other London hotels over the past few years often with the big names (Hilton, Thistle etc) but we were all in agreement that this hotel would be the one we would book again. You will not be disappointed."
112,930,"Mar 23 2005	Great hotel can b pricey	The Marriott Kensington, Formerly Swallow International, has been refurbished since 2003, so everything is in excellent shape. It is on the underground line direct to Heathrow. Underground stop (Earl's Court) is just a block away, is handicapped accessible (which means easy for heavy luggage, too) so you can save over $50 by avoiding a taxi. Its also just 2 blocks from the Gloucester RD underground, and has a major supermarket across the street. So a great location for London.I stayed using Marriott points, and got a very large executive level room, that was on a corner (#710) which was very quiet. Also, with a feather bed and down pillows, a very comfortable hotel. It also had a separate shower from bath, one with multiple shower heads - which was a treat. (I might expect that on non-executive floors, or perhaps other rooms, this might not be the case)The only complaints were the prices for telephone and foods. Telephone was over a pound for a local call, with hefty per minute charges too. An English breakfast in the restaurant was $30, so I woudln't recommend that. Happily, I am eligible for the executive lounge, which had a fine continental breakfast, and light foods and desserts in the evening which was just fine for me. The staff met all my requests, except the minibar was not working and was never fixed over the two days I was there. In any case, if the pricing works for you, this should be a very enjoyable experience."
113,930,"Feb 13 2005	Loved it!	My wife and I stayed in the Kensington Marriott for four days Feb to Mar 2004. And then for four days in the Renaissance Royal Chancery Court at over twice the price. We had planned to save the best for last but found we missed the Kensington Marriott despite having a larger room and running into celebs in the Renaissance's gym. The room is smallish and the public areas just o.k but we loved the gym and the pool. We've been to nicer pools at hotels but this one was indoors and fun, we met a lot of great people at the pool and got some tips from locals just staying the weekend. The area is the best, best Donner Kebab at Star Kebab near the Earl's Court tube stop after a night of pub crawling and the area is very safe and quaint. We've been to a number of Marriott properties and while the Kensington isn't Marriott's best it grows on you. The grocery store across the street is great for snacks and brought the kids back some U.K. easter candy. This was purely a leisure trip, we are a late thirties couple from California, it was my first trip to London but my wife went to college there and lived in Kensington while going to school so perhaps we favored the area. It is not a destination resort but for a nice clean room at a fair price in a great location it can't be beat. You are in london, get your butt out the room and get to a play, museum or pub(s)."
114,930,"Feb 9 2005	Great place to stay in Kensington	Stayed in this hotel Jan 24-29, 2005. Had a very good experience. Room was large, plenty of hot water, no problems with water pressure, and despite being right on a busy road was very quiet. We took the recommendation of some of the other reviewers and booked an executive level room. The continental breakfast that is included is very nice as was the ability to get a soda or water during the day. This was the first hotel we stayed in where there was space specifically left for the guest in the minibar-a very nice touch! The concierge was quite helpful arranging a cab for an early morning departure. All in all we had a pleasant experience and will definitely stay at this hotel again."
115,930,Nov 10 2004	GREAT HOTEL	I recently had the pleasure of spending 3 nights at the Marriott Kensington. I found the hotel to be in a great location ( 5 mins from tube). The hotel is beautiful and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Our room was lovely and very spacious. There are plenty of choices for dining in the area. There is also a store across the road as well a laundry mat for your convience. I would not hesitate to return or recommend this hotel to anyone.
116,930,"Sep 18 2004	Hated the London Marriott Hotel Kensington	My wife had a 2 week business trip and asked me to join her for a week in the middle of the 2 weeks. First the positive.... it was extremely clean, there is a grocery store and laundramat across the street, and it is a convenient location. But the air conditioner broke down a few days after my wife arrived and windows only open an inch or 2. They had a bunch of plumbers running around supposedly fixing the ac and the water leaks in all the halls, but after I was there a few days, it was obvious to me that they were making all the new leaks on purpose to create more work for themselves. When I figured it out one night, I told the hotel help but no one told the management and I had to show hotel management what was going on the next day. Plumbers dissappeared for a few days but still no ac. AC still not working by end of my wife's trip but fortunately London cooled off. Mattress was awful and we did not get one decent night sleep. Mini-bar prices are always expensive but 5 pounds of a 12 ounce cola???? You've got to be kidding. Finally, there was a constant high pitch sound in the room. Eventually I figured out it was the Phillips TV which had a background whine when turned off with the remote. Could be eliminated by turning it off completely at the tv. By the way, if you want to check the mattress it was room 022."

2,932,"Nov 19 2009 	Excellent family stay!	Travelling with a 2 and 5 year old I'm always picky on where we stay but I have to say this hotel was great and I would definatly stay there again. The rooms had two big double beds and were lovely and clean. For breakfast there was lots to choose from which is great for the kids. We stayed on a Saturday night and on the Sunday took advantage of the swimming pool, we were the only ones in there! The location is very good, only a short walk to the tube at Swiss Cottage. Overall a very enjoyable stay!One more thing in the reception area there is a small disney tv playing kids movies which is great when your having to hang around in reception for one thing or another."
3,932,"Nov 17 2009 	Good Hotel	Me and my partner stayed here for the weekend and the Hotel is very clean and the staff are very friendly.We took a taxi to the west end because it was raining very hard and some to tubes were not running and it cost us  14.00, so not that expensive.Did not get a chance to use any of the facitilies so cannot comment. It is 25 per night to park at the hotel under ground parking."
4,932,"Nov 9 2009 	Enjoyed our stay - comfortable and good location just overpriced.	As other reviews have noted the hotel looks worn from the outside, but don't let that put you off, the rooms and the service are quite good, and the bed was very comfortable. We didn't use the pool and health club but they also looked good. My wife and I enjoyed our stay here, however, the hotel just missed the mark for the price they charge. It was little things like trays and other material being left for extended periods in the hallways, seals that didn't fit well on the balcony sliding doors, and bathroom fittings that needed a refurbishment etc. We also had access to the Executive Lounge, but it was one of the more basic executive lounges I have been in. The overall impression wasn't helped by one lift, out of three, being out of action for refurbishment. Light sleepers should also avoid the rooms on the Adelaide St side of the hotel. The traffic noise starts very early on weekdays.The hotel is an easy walk to Swiss Cottage tube station on the Jubilee Line so travel into central London is easy - although the line is often closed for all or part of the weekends. However, there is a good replacement bus service and also plenty of normal bus routes close by for travel to the surrounding areas.We didn't eat in the hotel, as nearby Finchley Rd had several cafes and numerous restaurants - we particularly liked Eriki (Indian) and Luigis - and only a few minutes on the other side of Finchley Rd was the Singapore Gardens and nearby to that the Arches wine bar and restaurant - which had a very extensive wine list. All an easy walk."
5,932,"Oct 28 2009 	Nice enough hotel but the worst evening meal we have had in a long time	Agree with other reviews on the good location (near tube) and typically nice Marriott bedrooms. Would add a minor gripe at the swimming pool - a local lady was having her child's private swimming lesson (?) in the pool so when our excited group of children jumped in the pool she took it on herself to shout at them almost before their feet had hit the water - it was half term so not her private pool and, God forbid, other people wanted to use the facilities!! Plus as we were supervising our children, we would rather have been given the opportunity to reprimand them ourselves! Not sure why this pool is being used for private lessons is my point?Aside from this, what actually ruined our stay was the evening meal we had in the dining room. We had returned from a long day out visiting sights in London and were looking forward to our family meal. The food was awful. The children's main course arrived before the adults food by a good 15 minutes. When our food did arrive, the mashed potato was from a packet, the Beef Bourguignon used tinned beef, the vegetables arrived 15 minutes before our main course and the service was awful. The fries that the children had were cold and from a frozen packet. For a hotel like this and at the prices on the menu you would have expected much more. We asked to see the chef who did come and talk to us and after initially lying about the mashed potato, did finally admit it was from a packet! We did get most of the food taken off the bill ......... not the point, we were hungry!"
6,932,Oct 27 2009 	Good clean hotel excellent location	This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel as a family ( 9 and 14 year old) last stayed 7 years ago. Pleased to say just as satisfied this time as last. Admittedly outside does seem a bit run down now but room was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast good choice of fine food. We all found plenty of choices to satisfy us. We stayed 3 nights (Friday - Monday) and never experienced any queues at breakfast (but we were there by 7.30 am!). Excellent transport links - Swiss Cottage tube station just minutes away and even when this was closed on Saturday only a 25 min walk to Chalk Farm tube station. Main reason for choosing this hotel was the parking and we were pleased to find plenty of spaces. All in all very satisfactory visit and will most definitely stay here again next time in London
7,932,"Oct 26 2009 	Nice location. Don't judge by outside appearance.	The thing about this hotel is location. It is perfectly situated about 3 minutes walk from the Swiss Cottage tube station. And if you are there on the weekend Chalk Farm (Central) is a short bus/cab ride away. If you judge this hotel by the outside appearance you will probably never make it inside. It appears to be a late 70's or early 80's design that has not been updated. However, the inside mostly meets Marriott standards. A nice restaurant and a nice little bar were right inside the door. If you are sensitive to strong smells beware. Whatever they used as air freshener was so strong I could smell it when I came around the corner from the tube station and only got stronger as I got closer. Very annoying but never bothered me once I got to the room. The room was pretty standard. Nice big king bed with comfortable sheets and comforters. Apples and water from the maid every day, and turn down service. Internet was fast enough but expensive (about $150/wk US). Exec lounge was average at best. Overall a B+"
8,932,"Oct 11 2009 	Comfortable accomodations close to Swiss Cottage and Primrose Hill	I traveled with my 16 year old grandson and found the hotel had comfortable accomodations and was close to the Swiss Cottage tube stop and shops and restaurants. I liked being in a neighborhood rather than the center of the city. Part of the joy of visiting London is being able to use public transportation to get all over the city. We enjoyed the London Eye, Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum, British Museum and just walking around. Having a friend who lived 3 blocks away was a great plus.."

I was really annoyed when the room rate came up at 118 - but then added tax - bring it to around 135 - unheard of in my experience in the UK. This didn't even include breakfast.The room was fine, nice and big with a balcony. However, there was a big gap in the patio door so it would probably be freezing in winter! Pool was fine, although changing rooms located quite a distance from the pool and you have to go down a set of narrow steps with wet feet which isn't an ideal situation, especially for kids. The underground line at Swiss Cottage was closed the weekend we visited for the development work for the olympics, so we had to walk to Finsbury Park - 10 minutes walk, although this did take you past quite a number of good restaurants. Overall, the stay was ok - but I wouldn't pay this much money for this hotel again."

For the Underground station is just 5 mins walk, you can reach the very center easily. The rooms are furnished tastefully, the beds are very comfortable and you'll find everything you need.On our departure day we had a problem with my luggage and the staff of the hotel, especially their manager on duty, did an outstanding job in helping us to sort it out. You'll only really find out about the quality of a hotel and their guest relation when there is a problem to solve, an the staff of this hotel was really top."
11,932,"Sep 24 2009 	Good Marriott Hotel	My sister and I stayed here on points for 3 nights while visiting London. Hotel is further out of the center of tourist destinations, the closest touristy thing is the London Zoo. However, the hotel is located less than 10 minutes walk from the Swiss Cottage stop on the Jubilee line so getting around wasn't difficult. Hotel room was as expected for a Marriott with comfortable beds. I did have Platinum status, so my sister and I were able to make use of the Executive Lounge for snacks, beverages, light h'or d'oeuvres and breakfast. Hotel staff for the most part were very welcoming...the only person that wasn't so welcoming was the elderly lady who set out the nightly happy hour h'or d'oeuvres in the Executive Lounge...she always seemed suspicious as to whether my sister and I should be in the lounge as we were definitely the youngest looking people who made use of the lounge. She always checked their sign-in book to see if we had signed in whenever we showed up, but never did it to any of the other people who entered the lounge after us. Overall a good hotel, can't say that it's one I'd definitely return to, but it's definitely a hotel I'd use as a &quot;back up&quot; if there isn't a better option available when I'm back in London."

Staff very attentive, Executive lounge access enhanced our stay with excellent breakfasts, complimentary computer access and a place to unwind after a day's walking and touring. The room is comfortable, specially on the quiet side of the hotel. The hotel is well located for underground and bus access. We will return on our next visit to London."
